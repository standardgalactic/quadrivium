About the Author
A California native, Paula Tevis made many treks to San Francisco
as a young girl before moving to her favorite city in 1983. After an
eclectic but blessedly brief career that included stints in the com-
puter and nonprofit sectors, she and her husband produced a
couple of children in quick succession, and Paula happily relin-
quished the 9-to-5 world for the 24/7 one that parenting brings.
Upon regaining consciousness, Paula recalled a childhood ambi-
tion and declared herself a writer. From her humble beginnings
word-processing cookbook manuscripts for a local publisher,
Paula metamorphosed into a freelance copy editor and soon
received her first break as a professional writer with Parenting
magazine, crafting a column on kids who cook. Over the years, she
has contributed articles and essays to Family Fun magazine, the
San Francisco Chronicle, Citysearch.com, Frommer’s Las Vegas,
Frommer’s New Orleans, and Variety. She is the co-author of
California For Dummies and author of the original Frommer’s San
Francisco with Kids.


Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks to my dear cousins Irene Levin Dietz and Ina Levin
Gyemant, who have added so much to my life in San Francisco for
over 30 years. Eating in the city wouldn’t be the same without Bev
Chin or the guidance of Patricia Unterman; revisiting my favorite
neighborhoods is an even greater pleasure with my cadre of
friends, including Marjie Graham, Vicki Pate, Cynde Ahart Wood,
Helene and Charles Wright, Andrea and Jeff Tobias, and Sarah
Wilcox. Thanks also to Donna Joyner for her Wine Country
insights. Living, no matter where, is pretty terrific and lots of fun
with my husband, Mark Katz, and our very wonderful daughters,
Madeleine and Lili.

Introduction
M
any years ago, long before mandatory seat-belt laws, my mother
would occasionally squeeze my sister Patience and me into her
little red sports car and zoom up Highway 101 for a weekend in San
Francisco. We lived 350 miles south, in Santa Barbara, but thanks to my
mom’s lead foot, we’d be cruising along the bay in no time, past a hill
filled with rows of boxy pastel-colored houses, then onto the boulevard
that led to our cousin Mildred’s beautiful home. My desire to live in a big
city (and drive really fast) no doubt developed during these trips, and
many subsequent ones in my teens, but my ties to San Francisco actu-
ally extend back further. My grandmother Sarah and her sister, Lottie,
grew up here. At 18 and 20 years of age, they camped in Golden Gate
Park after the 1906 earthquake, and in later years they lived in a series of
houses in the Richmond District.
When I had the chance to move to San Francisco in 1982, I didn’t think
twice. My future husband and I lived near Haight Street, then moved to a
neighborhood near the Mission District and Bernal Heights. Eventually, 
I found myself working at one time or another around the Richmond
District, Civic Center, Potrero Hill, and South of Market. I loved getting
acquainted with different areas of the city, and in hindsight I realize my
early, admittedly dilettantish, professional life helped prepare me for the
greatest (and perhaps longest-lasting) job I’ve ever held — writing about
San Francisco.
The San Francisco of my grandmother’s day was elegant enough to
attract the most famous people of its time yet still wild enough to garner
an exciting reputation. The multicultural, expansive, and liberal city of
today continues in that tradition, and even improves upon it. After more
than 25 years of familiarity, I continue to marvel at everything San
Francisco has to offer, and I’ll bet that after a day or two spent here,
you’ll do the same.
About This Book
San Francisco For Dummies, 5th Edition, is foremost a reference guide for
people who intend to vacation in San Francisco and need basic, clear-cut
information on how to plan and execute the best possible trip. If you
like, you can begin reading from Chapter 1 and head straight through to
the appendix. But if you turn directly to the restaurant chapter or to the
pages on Wine Country because that’s the piece that interests you at the
moment, the book works just as well. I haven’t included absolutely
everything San Francisco has to offer in the way of attractions, hotels,
restaurants, or diversions — a book that size would be too heavy to

pack and probably too bothersome to read. What I’ve done is picked and
chosen what I believe to be worth your time and your money while still
offering enough variety to please a range of tastes, budgets, and family
configurations.
Let me underscore that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and in San Francisco this is especially true of restaurants as well
as prices. Therefore, I suggest that you write or call ahead for confirma-
tion when making your travel plans. The authors, editors, and publisher
cannot be held responsible for the experiences of readers while travel-
ing. Your safety is important to us, however, so we encourage you to
stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. Keep a close eye on cam-
eras, purses, and wallets, all favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
So, San Francisco, here you come! You’ve picked a stunner of a destina-
tion, with a wide variety of wonderful sites to see, fabulous foods to
sample, and interesting places to visit. But don’t be overwhelmed.
You’ve made a smart decision in buying San Francisco For Dummies, 5th
Edition. This book walks you through all the nitty-gritty details to make
sure that planning your trip goes smoothly and that the trip itself is
memorable.
In this book, I include lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions. As I
describe each, I often include abbreviations for commonly accepted
credit cards. Take a look at the following list for an explanation of each:
AE: American Express
CB: Carte Blanche
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
JCB: Japan Credit Bank
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I’ve divided the hotels into two categories: my personal favorites and
those that don’t quite make my preferred list but still get my hearty seal
of approval. Don’t hesitate to consider these “runner-up” hotels if you’re
unable to get a room at one of my favorites or if your preferences differ
from mine — the amenities that the runners-up offer and the services
that each provides make all these accommodations good choices to con-
sider as you determine where to rest your head at night.
I also include some general pricing information to help you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. I use a
San Francisco For Dummies, 5th Edition 
2

system of dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night in a hotel or
a meal at a restaurant (including appetizer, main course, dessert, one
drink, tax, and tip). Check out the following table to decipher the dollar
signs, and note that Wine Country hotels (see Chapter 14) have a
slightly different price scale:
Cost
SF Hotels
SF and Wine Country Restaurants
$
$125 or less
$30 or less
$$
$126–$175
$31–$60
$$$
$176–$300
$61–$100
$$$$
$301 or more
$101 or more
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs may be as a traveler:
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance on
whether to take a trip to San Francisco and how to plan for it.
 You may be an experienced traveler who doesn’t have a lot of time
to devote to trip planning or doesn’t have a lot of time to spend in
San Francisco. You want expert advice on how to maximize your
time and enjoy a hassle-free trip.
 You’re not looking for a book that discusses the history and archi-
tecture of the city, provides all the data available about San
Francisco, or lists every hotel, restaurant, or attraction. Instead,
you’re looking for a book that focuses on the places that will give
you the best or uniquely San Francisco experience.
If you fit any of these criteria, then San Francisco For Dummies, 5th
Edition, provides the information you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
Like all For Dummies guides, this book is organized in parts that contain
anywhere from two to four chapters of related information. You don’t
need to start at the very beginning (though it’s a very good place to
start); feel free to turn directly to the chapter that intrigues you the most.
Part I: Introducing San Francisco
This part gives you an overview of San Francisco, with particular atten-
tion to the lodging, dining, and touring highlights. Chapter 2 offers an
Introduction 3

overview of the city’s history and suggests some background material
that will get you counting the days until your vacation begins. The calen-
dar of events in Chapter 3 may influence your decision about when to
arrive, and the text on San Francisco seasons may convince you to land
when the rest of the tourists have gone home.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco
Because you’re reading this, you probably aren’t the type to just show
up without an appointment — you intend to do a good bit of planning.
That’s a good idea, and this part covers what you need to know about
travel costs, with tips on how to budget and directions for getting to San
Francisco, particularly if you plan to fly. Because this book is intended
for a varied audience, I include specific advice for family travelers, trav-
elers with disabilities, seniors, and gay and lesbian visitors. Then I help
you decide whether to rent a car, why travel insurance may be a good
idea, and how to stay in touch while you’re away from home.
Part III: Settling into San Francisco
In an unfamiliar city, figuring out where you are can take days, but Part
III saves you time by explaining how to get to town from the airport and
how to get around the most important neighborhoods. A thorough dis-
cussion on local transportation options follows, including everything I
know about parking — although luck and patience usually play a more
important role than mere words. When it comes to figuring out where to
sleep, I include a rundown of the major neighborhoods where visitors
stay, offering tips on getting the most room for your money and brief but
informative descriptions of my favorite hotels. A lengthy and tasty chap-
ter on dining will have you discussing the intricacies of the local food
scene as if you spend all your weekends dining in these parts. And if you
prefer to eat and run, you’ll get a head start with a section on food to 
go — and you won’t mistake it for fast food.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco
You likely have an idea of what you want to see, and this part provides
the information you need to conquer the most popular sites. Along with
the big stuff, I’ve categorized other fun and intriguing options under lots
of different interests and suggested some amusing guided tours. Many
people come to the city specifically to exercise their charge cards, and
my chapter on shopping will keep even the most avid consumer on his
or her toes. My three- and five-day itineraries in Chapter 13 will help you
focus and plan your days with all the precision you care to muster up.
Got a case of wanderlust? Don’t stay away long, but have a wonderful
time investigating a few of the beautiful areas an hour or less from the
city.
San Francisco For Dummies, 5th Edition

At the end of this part, I help you plan a day trip to Berkeley, an over-
nighter to Half Moon Bay, and a getaway to Wine Country, including
winery tours and a mud bath.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: 
San Francisco Nightlife
As my husband says during his annual pilgrimage to JazzFest in New
Orleans, “You can sleep when you’re dead.” But first, you need to figure
out where to go after dinner, and that’s what you’ll discover in Part V.
From opera to swing dancing to barhopping to cinema, you can always
find something stimulating to do or see around town.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This is where I get to lurch from the sublime (the best views) to the
practical (what to do if it’s raining; glorious San Francisco souvenirs for
under $10) and on to the ridiculous (how not to look like a tourist). But
plenty of useful information is yours in Part VI.
I also include an appendix — your Quick Concierge — containing lots of
handy information you may need when traveling in San Francisco, such
as phone numbers and addresses, numbers to call for emergency per-
sonnel and area hospitals and pharmacies, contact information for
babysitters, lists of local newspapers and magazines, protocol for find-
ing taxis, and more. Check out this appendix when searching for answers
to lots of little questions that may come up as you travel.
Icons Used in This Book
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and/or great deals.
Best of the Best highlights the best San Francisco has to offer in all cate-
gories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and
nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
Find useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time when
you see the Tip icon.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids.
Introduction 5

Part of the fun of traveling to a city other than your own is seeing all the
things that you won’t find anywhere else — especially when so much of
the landscape is dotted with the same old same old. This icon highlights
sights and activities that really help you get a feel for San Francisco and
its uniqueness.
Where to Go from Here
Grab some sticky notes to mark the pages that you may want to refer to
later, clear your calendar, check the condition of your suitcase, and get
ready to hit the road.

Introducing 
San Francisco

In this part . . . 
I

sounds that make up this unique city. I do my best to guide

Discovering the Best 
of San Francisco
In This Chapter

 Bedding down in the city’s best hotels
 Chowing down at the most interesting restaurants
 Nurturing a love-Haight shopping relationship
 Partying around the City by the Bay
W
ith a wink and a wave to the past, San Francisco continues to
reinvent herself like a determined matron plotting the next round
of cosmetic surgery. In her starring role as the heartbeat of the Internet
economy, this gracious city sashayed toward the 21st century with an
energy and style that caused even the old guard to gasp in admiration.
Then, before there was time to dump all the stock options, the bubble
burst, the old-timers scrambled to diversify their portfolios, and young
commercial real-estate brokers and Web designers seriously considered
dental school. Fortunately, some things remain the same: The beautiful
scenery continues to dazzle, the top-flight dining continues to garner
raves, and the entertainment possibilities continue to grow in sophisti-
cation and imagination.
No matter how the economy fares, San Francisco consistently rates as
one of the top tourist destinations in the world, and the reason is no
secret. The city’s treasured cable cars provide both thrills and great
views as they whiz down and around our hills; a majestic golden bridge
suspends travelers over the deep blue of the bay; hidden staircases lead
to lovely gardens and eye-catching homes. And where else can you
savor freshly made miniature chocolate truffles, meander down the most
crooked street in the world, and escape from Alcatraz — all in one
action-packed day?
Summarizing San Francisco is not easy. When it comes to culture, the
city delivers everything from grand opera to leather-clad, fire-dancing
performance artists. As for dining, we can down a burrito for lunch and
polish off a multicourse designer meal for dinner — and critique both

with equal passion. Our neighborhoods are more like villages, each with
its own retail corridor, park, and distinct personality. For in the face of
rampant cultural homogeneity — the malling of America, so to speak —
San Francisco holds tight to its individualism and enthusiastically
applauds, or quietly salutes, those who do the same. What is consistent
about the city, from the top of Telegraph Hill to sunny China Basin, is
constant surprise. As you round a bend in the road, a lovely vista unex-
pectedly pops into your line of sight. As you savor a glass of chardon-
nay, a Chinese funeral cortege may suddenly glide past your cafe table,
the band playing a pop classic. Or the smell of roasting coffee beans may
waft down the street and completely erase thoughts of anything but
where to find an espresso. Give your senses free rein to guide you
through your days here, and you’ll have a vacation like no other.
Because I consider the following to be the best San Francisco experi-
ences, I’ve marked them with a Best of the Best icon when they appear
elsewhere in the book.
Best San Francisco Travel Experiences
Strolling along the Embarcadero to Aquatic Park: This walk is a quin-
tessential San Francisco activity, ideally experienced on a sunny day. I
prefer to start across from the baseball stadium on Third Street, although
exiting Muni at the Embarcadero (see Chapter 8) and beginning there is
more convenient. With the water on one side and city landmarks on the
other, a leisurely walk past the piers, through Fisherman’s Wharf (see
Chapter 8), leads to Aquatic Park and the Municipal Pier. Be sure to hike
all the way to the end of the pier, stopping to see what, if anything, the
anglers have caught. Your reward will be million-dollar bay vistas.
Shopping at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market: Saturday morning finds
home cooks and food lovers of all ages crowding the stalls in front of
and behind the Ferry Building. You can sample stellar organic fruits,
homemade conserves, and goat cheeses, or you can chow down on the
freshest morning pastries, bread, and heartier dishes from some of the
city’s well-known restaurants. This is a ritual for lots of local chefs who
chat up their favorite vendors and bag the choicest morsels. See
Chapter 10.
Rooting for the Giants at AT&T Park: You don’t have to be a baseball fan
to enjoy an afternoon or evening at this diamond of a ballpark with the
ever-changing corporate name. Bleacher seats go on sale on game days,
but if you prefer something with more cachet, you can usually buy seats
online from season-ticket holders. You’ll find the best food, including
amazing hot dogs, at the concession stands — load up on the sauerkraut
and mustard, and then maybe scramble for a fly ball. See Chapter 11.
Biking in Golden Gate Park: Rentals are easy to arrange along Stanyon
Street and around Stow Lake. John F. Kennedy Drive, which closes to
automobile traffic on Sunday, holidays, and summer Saturdays, will take

you on a meandering route through this lovely slice of green. At the end
of the road you’ll be near the newly restored Murphy’s Windmill. From
there, head north toward Fulton Street to see the Dutch Windmill. In
early spring, the tulips here are in full, glorious bloom. See Chapter 11.
Sipping a cappuccino in North Beach: On a weekday morning when
everyone else is at work, sitting with a newspaper and an espresso
defines contentment — but it’s a great idea anytime. You’ll have your
pick of cafes in North Beach, and I’m happy to recommend bright,
roomy Caffe Roma (see Chapter 10), which has a fine selection of high-
carb goodies. Plus, the staff roasts the coffee beans on-site.
The Best Hotels
Best All-Around Family Hotels: The playful and warm Serrano Hotel,
405 Taylor St. (% 866-289-6561 or 415-885-2500), can provide young fam-
ilies with complimentary cribs, strollers, and even booster seats; older
children will be delighted to find games scattered around the public
areas and extras that include mini Etch-a-Sketches in the minibar. The
moderately priced Hotel Del Sol, 3100 Webster St. (% 877-433-5765 or
415-921-5520), has goodies for the kids plus a fab outdoor pool. The
Hotel Monaco, 501 Geary St. (% 866-622-5284 or 415-292-0100), com-
bines style with all the practicalities you want in an upscale hotel, such
as an excellent restaurant, top-quality staff, and a spa. Although I’d
never suggest that you abandon the children (for too long), you could
have a massage downstairs while they hang out in the room watching a
movie and enjoying room service.
Best Hotels for a Romantic Weekend: The outdoor soaking tubs at the
Hotel Vitale, 8 Mission St. (% 888-890-8688 or 415-278-3700), seem to
me a good place to start the fun. Then, reserve a deluxe waterfront room
and hang out the DO NOT DISTURB sign. If you’re out to impress, the spa-
cious Bolero penthouse suite in the Hotel Adagio, 550 Geary St. (% 800-
228-8830 or 415-775-5000), boasts a lovely outdoor terrace, and the hotel
itself is lively.
Best View: You can be assured of a breathtaking view from the bay
rooms at the cozy Harbor Court Hotel, 165 Steuart St. (% 866-792-6283
or 415-882-1300). Cityscapes from the windows of the W San Francisco,
181 Third St. % (877-946-8357 or 415-777-5300) look even more magnifi-
cent from the hotel’s newly redesigned rooms. Request a “spectacular”
bay view room above the 14th floor.
Best Hotel Pool: Children under 16 aren’t allowed in the pool at the
Huntington Hotel, 1075 California St. (% 800-227-4683 or 415-474-5400),
so you’ll be the one to blame for the splashing and noise.
Best Hotel If You Have a Car: For stays around Union Square, the
Galleria Park Hotel, 191 Sutter St. (% 800-792-9639 or 415-781-3060),
sits over a parking garage, so the valet shouldn’t take too long to
Part I: Introducing San Francisco 
12

retrieve your car. All the downtown hotels charge at least $30 per day
(plus tax); if you really can’t live without the car, be sure to inquire
about parking packages when you book your room. Parking is free at the
Cow Hollow Motor Inn & Suites, 2190 Lombard St. (% 415-921-5800),
and Lombard Street takes you to the Golden Gate Bridge. Japantown’s
Hotel Kabuki, 1625 Post St. (% 800-553-4567 or 415-922-3200), gets my
commendation for having soothingly attractive rooms and relatively rea-
sonable parking fees ($25/day).
The Best Restaurants
Best for a Romantic Meal: I like Absinthe, 398 Hayes St. (% 415-551-
1590), for the food and décor, and Quince, 1701 Octavia St. (% 415-
775-8500), which is so personable and delicious that eating there will
make you quite fond of whomever you’re with.
Best with Kids: You can’t go wrong with Chow, 215 Church St. (% 415-
552-2469), or Park Chow, 1240 Ninth Ave. (% 415-665-9912), which
have identical menus. The price is right; the food is nonthreatening, rec-
ognizable, and tasty; and the casual atmosphere is relaxing.
Best for a Splurge: This category is not an easy one, because there are
lots of amazing kitchens to choose from, but I have no qualms about
directing you to Restaurant Gary Danko, 800 North Point St. (% 415-
749-2060). This place is inviting yet sophisticated, completely profes-
sional on every level, and the food is superb. For splurging in a more
formal atmosphere, the Michelin-starred Dining Room at the Ritz-
Carlton, 600 Stockton St. (% 415-773-6168), illustrates the meaning of
“to die for.”
Best Neighborhood Spots: In the Mission District, Range, 842 Valencia
St. (% 415-282-8283), is all the rage — and deservedly so — while the
Blue Plate, 3218 Mission St. (% 415-282-6777), feels like one of those
secret finds that you want to visit again and again. Around Cow Hollow
(or anywhere in the city, really), Isa, 3324 Steiner St. (% 415-567-9588),
is plainly a winner, with absolutely delicious food and delightful service.
Best Views: Forget about the overpriced tourist traps around PIER 39 —
you can’t see much at night, anyway. For the best views at bargain prices,
have lunch at the San Francisco Art Institute cafe, 800 Chestnut St. 
(% 415-771-7020). For a gourmet vegetarian dinner and great scenery,
Greens Restaurant, Fort Mason, Building A, off Marina Boulevard at
Buchanan Street (% 415-771-6222), sets the standard.
The Best Shopping
Best for Generalists: Kids, men, brides, your mother — there’s some-
thing for everyone who has excellent taste at Dandelion, 55 Potrero Ave.
(% 415-436-9500).
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of San Francisco 13

Best for Books: This is more than a bookstore: City Lights, 261 Columbus
Ave. (% 415-362-8193), is representative of an era and a movement.
Owner-poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti was one of the founders of the Beat
movement. That it’s also a terrific place to browse and buy is not com-
pletely incidental.
Best for People Who Consider Themselves Cool: Naturally, if you fall
into this category, you wouldn’t advertise it (that wouldn’t be cool, now
would it?), but of course even cool people have to shop. You’ll find
clothing, gifts, and skateboards on Haight Street (best if you are shop-
ping with your kids), and clothing, gifts, and oddities on even hipper
Valencia Street.
Best for People Who Love Brand Names: Union Square. The labels you
want are all within a 2- or 3-block radius.
The Best Bars and Clubs
Best for American Idol Fans: You won’t find better entertainment for
the price of a cocktail than at the Mint Karaoke Lounge, 1942 Market St.
(% 415-626-4726), and the patrons are pretty friendly. Given that it’s in
the Castro, you may want to take extra care with your appearance, espe-
cially if you plan to take the stage!
Best for Lost Fans: The exotic décor at trendy Bambuddha Lounge, at
the Phoenix Hotel, 601 Eddy St. (% 415-885-5088), complements the
sultry, sulky clientele stirring apple martinis while awaiting small plates
of Southeast Asian goodies. Word is the service is uppity, but no one will
ask you to discuss your past.
Best for How To Look Good Naked Fans: It’s really tacky, but if you
want to see what plastic surgeons can accomplish these days, reserve
seats at the bar at AsiaSF, 201 Ninth St. (% 415-255-2742; see Chapter
10), where “gender illusionists” strut their implants for 10 minutes each
hour.
Best for Dancing with the Stars Fans: Friday and Saturday nights at the
Top of the Mark in the InterContinental Mark Hopkins hotel, 1 Nob Hill
(% 415-616-6916), the Black Market Jazz Orchestra performs for your
dancing pleasure. Dress up and practice your dipping technique.
Best for Dr. John Fans: Yoshi’s Jazz Club, 1330 Fillmore St. (% 415-
665-5600), is a spin-off of the famous East Bay music venue. The swanky
restaurant and club, in a revitalized section of the Fillmore, has become
an exciting destination for jazz enthusiasts. Plan ahead if you want tick-
ets, because shows sell out.

San Francisco

 Reading about and viewing San Francisco in books and films
U
nlike American cities that evolved in a less interesting fashion, San
Francisco has been molded politically, socially, and physically by 
a variety of (literally) earth-shaking events. In this chapter, I give you a
quick rundown on the history of the City by the Bay, along with some
other useful background on local views and customs that give visitors
insight into the city and its inhabitants.
History 101: The Main Events
As late (relatively speaking) as 1846, San Francisco was a sparsely popu-
lated town, described by the writer and California historian Robert
Ernest Cowan as “the squalid little village.” A mere two years later, the
sleepy collection of shacks and saloons multiplied almost overnight into
a thriving, lawless, still squalid but much larger burg, and nothing — 
not rampant corruption, numerous fires, or hordes of unsuccessful
miners — could keep endless waves of people from arriving here by 
ship or other means to seek their fortunes.
But first, a little background: Portuguese sailors navigated the coastline 
of the Bay Area as early as 1542, and although the area was an object of
speculation among European explorers, it remained the unmolested
province of the Ohlone Indian tribes until the late 18th century. Europeans
didn’t discover San Francisco Bay itself until 1769, when Sergeant Jose
Francisco de Ortega, on a scouting mission for Gaspar de Portola, found
the mouth of the port. Seven years later, a contingent of Spanish Catholics
arrived, establishing a fort on the site of today’s Presidio and one of many
Franciscan missions, Nuestra Señora de Dolores, a mile away in what is
now the Mission District. The first service took place five days before the
signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. (Mission Dolores, the

oldest building in the city and one of the few to survive earthquakes 
and fire, is Registered Landmark Number 1 of the city and county of San
Francisco.) After this flurry of excitement, there wasn’t much to report
until Mexico severed ties with Spain in 1821 and became sovereign over
California. American ships from Boston then began a vigorous trade with
the settlement for otter and beaver skins, and later for goods such as
tallow (rendered animal fat used for soap and candles). A slow migration
into the area by hunters and trappers from the Eastern Seaboard, and
occasionally by AWOL sailors from merchant ships, helped increase the
local population to around 250 by 1833. In January 1847, now officially
under American rule, Yerba Buena (Spanish for “good herb”) was
renamed San Francisco.

The discovery of gold in the American River near Sutter’s Mill at the end
of 1847 was the mighty force that propelled San Francisco into the big
leagues. When word got out late in 1848, San Francisco’s population of
812 quickly contracted as every able-bodied man and boy took off for
the Sierra Nevada. By 1849, immigrants were arriving in San Francisco 
at the rate of 1,000 per week. The smart money stayed in the city and
started businesses to take advantage of the newly rich and those hoping
to join them — drinking establishments, gambling dens, and houses of
prostitution most prominent among the enterprises. Naturally, crime
and corruption were rife. By 1851, vigilante groups formed to do what
police and politicians were bribed not to, and after a few well-placed
hangings, things slowly began to calm down.
By 1870, barely 23 years old, San Francisco was already the tenth-largest
city in the United States. In that time, it had survived a remarkable
migration, a half-dozen fires, inflation, vice, graft, torrential rains, and an
earthquake (in 1865). The transcontinental railroad linked the East and
West coasts, and the thousands of Chinese laborers who had laid the rail
became objects of vilification for underemployed whites, who appeared
to forget that they were immigrants, too.
Still, San Francisco thrived — not even Mother Nature, it seems, could
stop the momentum. Certainly, the great earthquake of April 18, 1906,
was a momentous catastrophe; fires raged for four days and more than
3,000 people (of a population of 400,000) died in collapsed and burning
buildings or from related ills. Two-thirds of the city was destroyed, and
thousands of homeless people went to live in Golden Gate Park until
housing could be constructed. But rebuilding began immediately, and in
1915, San Francisco reintroduced herself to the world by hosting the
Panama-Pacific International Exposition.
The Gold Rush was responsible for the first mass influx of people into
San Francisco, and World War II precipitated the second, as workers
from the South flocked to the city’s shipyards. Postwar prosperity com-
bined with an anything-goes reputation attracted nonconformists,
artists, writers, and free thinkers, paving the way for the Beats, and later
the hippie movement, to influence an entire nation. The second half of
the 20th century found San Francisco grappling with the murders of its
mayor, George Moscone, and the country’s first openly gay politician,
Supervisor Harvey Milk, in 1978. Dan White, a homophobic former city
supervisor, was convicted of manslaughter in the killings. California
Senator Dianne Feinstein, at that time the president of San Francisco’s
Board of Supervisors, became mayor.
San Francisco’s most recent big earthquake, an attention-getting 7.1 on
the Richter scale, hit in the afternoon on October 17, 1989, as the Giants
were preparing to play Game 3 of the World Series. In those days before
cellphones and wireless Internet, the city came to a halt. With buses and
streetcars unable to operate, sections of the Bay Bridge damaged, and
fires and collapsed buildings in the Marina neighborhood, the city felt
strangely vulnerable. Miraculously, only 63 people died.

18

The 1990s will be remembered for the dot.com boom-and-bust years.
San Francisco may not have been as obviously wild as it was during the
aftermath of the Gold Rush, but it isn’t a stretch to draw a few compar-
isons. Millionaires were created overnight in the frenzy to take rather
specious companies public, while investors threw money at young entre-
preneurs who turned out to have less-than-feasible business plans. Real-
estate prices went mad, and even sensible people went looking for a
technology start-up to join.
And then, it was over. The 21st century had barely introduced itself
before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, devastated the coun-
try. With the stock market on a downward spiral and the economy reel-
ing, a town that relies on tourism and business travel took a hit. Yet,
nearing the end of this decade, San Francisco is in the midst of a thriving
building boom. The phoenix, the mythical bird that arose whole from the
ashes and graces San Francisco’s official flag, is an apt symbol for this
vibrant, beautiful, and unquestionably desirable city.
Taste of San Francisco: Local Cuisine
San Francisco’s reputation as a food-lover’s paradise is well deserved
and tested on a daily basis. You can find thousands of restaurants
around town, from dives to divas, all with loyal followings and all under
constant scrutiny by critics and self-proclaimed gourmands. Between
the competition and the narrowed eyes of the food patrol, a restaurateur
has to stay sharp, or at least hire a crackerjack public-relations firm, to
survive the first year in business. The constant buzz and change in the
food scene can be a little nerve-racking to track, but it serves to make
dining an event for locals and tourists alike. In the end, fortunately, it all
comes down to ingredients. And where else but in San Francisco do you
find the freshest, most beautiful, and even most politically correct fruits,
veggies, fish, and organically raised meats? Well, Berkeley, maybe, but
certainly nowhere else.
Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
Getting acquainted with San Francisco through the work of authors and
filmmakers will provide an extra dimension to your trip and perhaps
some added excitement when you happen upon a location you recognize
from a favorite cinematic moment or literary passage. San Francisco’s
own Chronicle Books publishes a great variety of material on the city, for
children, cooks, art and architecture students, and readers of memoir
and fiction. One of Chronicle’s best books to stimulate your interest and
curiosity is San Francisco Stories: Great Writers on the City, edited by
John Miller. This collection of short pieces covers the personal and the
political as recalled by acclaimed authors including Mark Twain, Jack
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into San Francisco 19

Kerouac, Tom Wolfe, and Amy Tan. To find out about a smaller, more inti-
mate city, check out Chronicle’s Good Life in Hard Times: San Francisco
in the ’20s and ’30s, by former journalist and San Francisco native Jerry
Flamm.
One of the more famous and beloved pieces of modern fiction based in
San Francisco is Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City (published by
Perennial). If you’ve seen the miniseries, and especially if you haven’t,
this is a “must read” for a leisurely afternoon — or the inbound plane
ride. Maupin’s 1970s soap opera covers the residents of 28 Barbary Lane
(Macondry Lane on Russian Hill was the inspiration), melding sex,
drugs, and growing self-awareness with enormous warmth and humor.
A work of fiction featuring San Francisco during the Gold Rush is
Daughter of Fortune, by acclaimed novelist and Marin County resident
Isabel Allende (published by HarperTorch). Allende’s vivid depiction 
of life in California during the mid–19th century is one of the novel’s
strengths.
As one of the loveliest spots on the planet, San Francisco has been a
favorite of location scouts since the beginning of the film industry.
Hundreds of movies and television shows have been shot or set in San
Francisco, making the hills and bridges among the most recognized of
backgrounds. It may be difficult to locate at your local video store, but
the 1936 Clark Gable–Jeanette MacDonald romance San Francisco is
lauded for its dramatic reenactment of the 1906 earthquake and for
MacDonald’s rendition of the song of the same name. The Maltese Falcon
(1941), Dashiell Hammett’s classic detective story, with Humphrey
Bogart starring as Sam Spade, includes shots of the Bay Bridge, the
Ferry Building, and Burrit Alley (above the Stockton Tunnel). John’s
Grill, mentioned in the novel, continues to flog its association with
Hammett’s hero from its location at 63 Ellis St. (between Stockton and
Powell streets).
Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo (1958), starring James Stewart and Kim Novak,
is admittedly an obvious choice on the list of great San Francisco films,
but it’s always worth viewing. Stewart plays a former detective hired to
tail the wife of an old college friend, but the woman’s identity is less than
clear. In the meantime, Stewart becomes obsessed with his prey as they
make their way around the Palace of the Legion of Honor, Fort Point,
Mission Dolores, and the detective’s apartment at 900 Lombard St. The
city also fared well in the 1968 thriller Bullitt, starring Steve McQueen.
Along with the hair-raising car chase over many hills, you’ll see the Bay
Bridge from a recognizable point on the Embarcadero, Mason Street
heading north next to the Fairmont Hotel, the front of the Mark
Hopkins Hotel, Grace Cathedral, and the fairly unchanged Enrico’s
Sidewalk Café.
For a change of pace and no tragic law-enforcement characters, screen
the romantic comedy What’s Up Doc? (1972), with Barbra Streisand and
Ryan O’Neal. Along with being a very funny film, it has another car chase
Part I: Introducing San Francisco 
20

scene that includes Lombard Street and Chinatown and ends at Alta
Plaza Park in Pacific Heights. If you have kids to rev up, the 1993
comedy Mrs. Doubtfire, starring Sally Field and the city’s favorite son,
Robin Williams, shows San Francisco under blue skies and cable cars
with plenty of room. The house where the character’s estranged wife
and children live is at 2640 Steiner St. (at Broadway), in case you care 
to gawk.
24 Hours on Craigslist (see Chapter 11) is a documentary that covers 
a day in the life of the Internet community bulletin-board phenom. 
The filmmaker posted an ad on Craigslist, followed up with a handful of
volunteers — an Ethel Merman impersonator seeking a Led Zeppelin
cover band; a couple looking for others to join a support group for dia-
betic cats; a single, older woman in search of a sperm donor — and 
sent film crews to cover their stories. Unlike other films that show the
physical splendors of San Francisco, 24 Hours on Craigslist will give 
you a sense of the city’s psyche, or at least offer an explanation of why
non–San Franciscans think the place is populated with . . . uh . . . unusual
types.
Finally, as I type this, Gus Van Sant is directing Sean Penn in Milk, a
biopic of the late supervisor Harvey Milk (see San Francisco Timeline)
scheduled for release in 2009. The film crew has been in and around City
Hall, and set designers have redecorated Castro Street to resemble the
’70s—not that it’s changed that much.

Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Choosing the best season to visit
 Finding events that will get you going
You may not have much choice when it comes to scheduling your
trip, especially if you have to plan around school vacations and hol-
idays. But in case you do have some leeway, in this chapter I outline
what’s going on in San Francisco at different times of the year in terms 
of weather, crowds, and special events. The weather we locals long for 
is days of balmy temperatures and clear skies. I can only hope you find
the same, but in case you don’t, bring a warm jacket and maybe a hat, 
no matter when you’re visiting. And remember, a little fog never hurt
anybody.
Revealing the Secret of the Seasons
Because of its temperate Northern California address, San Francisco
beckons to tourists and business travelers year-round. It’s most
crowded between June and October. If you visit during this time of the
year, I’d recommend that you make hotel and car reservations at least
six weeks in advance, reserve a table at the better-known restaurants
three to four weeks in advance, and purchase your tickets to Alcatraz
(see Chapter 11) shortly after you commit to the trip. Don’t arrive in the
city with just a suitcase, a camera around your neck, and a smile. You
don’t want to waste your time and energy searching for accommoda-
tions or squabbling with your traveling companion because the Slanted
Door (see Chapter 10) couldn’t seat you.
Something to remember about the San Francisco “summer” is that it
may not be the season you’re expecting. Temperatures rarely top 70
degrees Fahrenheit and are often quite cool before lunchtime. Bring a
sweater and be prepared for morning fog — at any time of year.
The city is at its warmest and most glorious in September and October.
In an average year, these months are also the busiest. Fisherman’s Wharf
is packed to the gills, every cable car overflows with bodies, and there’s

not an available hotel room in sight. Unless something unusual is keep-
ing the tourists home, don’t even think about trying to get a discount on
accommodations during this time.
School vacation schedules will probably dictate your travel dates if
you’re bringing the kids. Normally, July and August days start out with
heavy fog and eventually clear enough for you to lose the jacket or
sweatshirt. Prepare for crowds, especially at the most popular tourist
destinations. Fortunately, a little imaginative planning can help you
entertain your children while avoiding some (though not all) of the
masses. (See Chapter 11 for some offbeat sightseeing ideas.)
During the winter, the visitors do thin out considerably. (Those seeking 
a tan at this time of year should try Florida or maybe Singapore.)
November through March, when the weather can be damp and chilly, is
downtime for tourists in San Francisco. But if you don’t mind sightseeing
while carrying an umbrella, or bundled up in a sweater and a hat, you
can get a terrific deal at a nice hotel. You may even find yourself pleas-
antly surprised by blue skies and temperatures in the low 60s (and no
fog!) in the middle of February. In general, room rates are lower between
November and mid-April, unless a big convention is in town (check with
the San Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau at % 415-391-2000;
www.onlyinsanfrancisco.com). A few attractions even reduce their
entrance fees at this time of year.
Winter can be a great time to see San Francisco, in spite of the weather,
which will still be an improvement over much of the United States. A
good number of the larger hotels offer packages, and some have special
events for kids. You can admire the Christmas windows decorating
Union Square, skate around the Embarcadero Center’s outdoor ice rink,
and take in one of many Nutcracker ballet and music performances.
In the following sections, I fill you in on the pros and cons of each
season. For information on average temperatures and rainfall, take a

Winter
You’re unlikely to see snow unless you drive to Tahoe, but the weather
won’t exactly be balmy, either. Still, a winter visit to San Francisco has
its advantages, including the following:
 Hotel prices are lower, especially on weekends.
 Cable cars aren’t jam-packed.
 Store windows are decorated for the holidays.
 The January sales linger into February.
 Restaurants won’t be as busy as during the rest of the year.
But keep in mind the following wintertime minus:
 The skies may be gray and/or rainy.
Spring
Spring is a popular time for travel, but in San Francisco, it’s also a popu-
lar time for conventions. Here are some of the advantages to expect if
you’re considering a springtime visit:
 Flowers are in bloom in the parks.
 The weather can be glorious.
 The major sites will be less crowded than in summer.
But keep in mind the following springtime drawback:
 Convention season starts, bringing hotel costs up and making it
even harder than usual to get reservations at the most popular
eateries.
Summer
Many travelers are surprised at how cool and foggy San Francisco sum-
mers are. Here are some of the advantages to visiting in the summer
months:
 Mimes are out in full force.
 Longer days make evening tours of Alcatraz more attractive.
 The city sponsors free weekend concerts at Golden Gate Park and
Stern Grove.
 The fruit and vegetable bounty available at the Ferry Plaza Farmers
Market is mouthwateringly spectacular.
Part I: Introducing San Francisco 
24

But here are some negatives about visiting in the summertime:
 Mimes are out in full force.
 PIER 39 and Fisherman’s Wharf are madhouses.
 Hotels are packed.
 Foggy mornings are downers.
Fall
If reliably warm, sunny days are a top priority for you, fall is the best
time to visit. Here are some other advantages to planning your trip for
the autumn months:
 It’s the finest weather of the year, on average.
 The cultural season begins.
But keep in mind the following drawbacks:
 Napa Valley is solidly booked on the weekends.
 The heavy events calendar lures additional crowds.
Marking Your Calendar
I list San Francisco’s most popular or unusual special events and festivals
in the following sections. However, I don’t have room to mention the tons
of other street fairs, film festivals, and happenings. For more events,
check out the San Francisco Bay Guardian Web site (www.sfbg.com), the
San Francisco Chronicle Web site (www.sfgate.com), or the Citysearch
Web site (www.sanfrancisco.citysearch.com), or order the free
Convention and Visitors Bureau Visitors Kit, which includes a Festivals
and Special Events calendar (see the appendix). Call the phone numbers
listed for each event for exact dates, locations, and ticket prices (if any).
You pay no entry charge for street fairs and holiday festivals, but bring
along some cash for the crafts booths and food.
How do you keep a festival festive? Don’t drive. Parking is always impos-
sible, and you’ll just get frustrated driving around in circles. Walk, take
public transportation, or, if all else fails, grab a cab — it’s well worth the
expense.
January/February
An important, well-attended, two-week event in San Francisco’s Chinatown
is Chinese New Year (% 415-982-3071; www.chineseparade.com).
Included in the event are lots of free entertainment, an exciting parade,
and colorful sights. Dates vary.

Planning Your Trip 
to San Francisco

In this part . . . 
T
his part of the book covers the basics of trip planning. If
you’re an experienced traveler, you may opt to skim the
next four chapters for any pearls of brilliance that apply to
you. If you’re a travel novice, here you discover various
options, including which airport to use. I thoroughly cover
money — how much you need and what you’re likely to
spend it on. Then I move on to speciﬁc tips for families, sen-
iors, travelers with disabilities, and gay and lesbian visitors
to San Francisco. If you think you may need a car while you’re
in San Francisco, be sure to weigh the pros and cons of driv-
ing around the city noted in Chapter 7.

Chapter 4
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Figuring out the cost of things
 Knowing where to go for money
 Cutting your expenses down to size
V
acationing in San Francisco can be costly. Convention and Visitors
Bureau statistics show that the average daily per capita spending
for all visitors, not including those who stay with relatives or friends,
was a substantial $244.33 in 2005, and it has only increased since then.
The major expenditure is lodging. Food takes the next-largest bite out of
your pocketbook.
Money may or may not make the world go ’round, but nothing spoils a
vacation faster than stressing over a higher-than-expected dinner tab or
running out of dough altogether. This chapter covers everything from
figuring the cost of your trip to the nitty-gritty of how to get your cash
while you’re in town.
Planning Your Budget
Creating a travel budget is easy, but sticking to it can be difficult, espe-
cially in a city that provides so many enticements to open your wallet.
The Bay Area is not a cheap date. You’ll likely spend the largest propor-
tion of your funds on airfare (if you’re flying) and lodging. You can spend
as lavishly as you like on food, but you can also eat well inexpensively. I
don’t recommend that you rent a car (see Chapter 7 for my reasons),
and that will save a bundle on parking alone. Other expenses to consider
include transportation around the city, snacks and beverages, attraction
admission fees, shopping, entertainment, and incidentals such as tele-
phone calls. After you figure your expenses, follow my general rule and
add 15 percent. (Unless you’re unusually disciplined, you won’t come in
under budget.)
Transportation
Most people arriving in San Francisco do so by plane or car. If you’re
driving, be aware that gas prices in Northern California are among the
highest in the country.

Airline ticket prices depend on so many variables that I would be foolish
to suggest what you’ll pay to fly. See Chapter 5 for tips on how to get the
best deal. Always contact low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines
or JetBlue, which don’t show up on most travel Web sites. As of this
writing, a round-trip flight in July from New York’s JFK to Oakland on
JetBlue was $460. Checking on Expedia.com, American had round-trip
flights from JFK to San Francisco starting at $386. Of course, the more
convenient flight times cost considerably more, and fuel surcharges may
add to the cost.
Lodging
Chapter 9 discusses everything you need to know about hotels, but to
summarize, prices depend on occupancy rates, and occupancy rates
depend on variables such as the economy and the time of year. I’ve
included a range of rooms to suit pocketbooks large and small, but keep
in mind that bargains are relative. I’ve seen $79 rooms that would ruin
some vacations. Remember: You get what you pay for.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
34
The cost of things to come
Knowing what to expect is always comforting, especially when it comes to counting the
cost. Here are some average prices for goods and services in San Francisco:
 Small lemonade at PIER 39: $2.25
 Latte in North Beach: $3
 Anchor Steam draft beer at Johnny Foley’s: $5
 Lunch for one at the Cliff House Bistro (moderate): $16–$27
 Lunch for one at Cafe Asia (inexpensive): $10
 Three-course dinner for one (excluding tax and tip) at the Blue Plate 
(moderate): $40
 Three-course dinner for one at Home (inexpensive): $23
 Super Shuttle from airport to hotel (excluding tip): $16
 Taxi from airport to city center (excluding tip): $35–$45
 One-way Muni/bus fare to any destination within the city (adult): $1.50
 One-way Muni/bus fare anywhere within the city (senior or child 5–17): 50¢
 Movie ticket at the Sundance Kabuki for an adult: $12.50
 Ticket to Beach Blanket Babylon: $25–$78

Dining
Dining out is a big deal in the Bay Area. If your hometown is bereft 
of decent restaurants, budget for at least one splurge meal in San
Francisco. Study Chapter 10 for ideas on where to eat well on the cheap.
Sightseeing
Many of San Francisco’s enduring attractions are free — like the Golden
Gate Bridge, the parks, the hidden staircases, and neighborhood walks.
Others, such as the cable cars, are inexpensive. Part IV includes lots of
ways to see the city without bruising your bank account.
Shopping
Souvenirs both annoy and inspire me. I fondly recall a small replica of
the Eiffel Tower an older brother left on a bookcase in my childhood
home, but still I cluck disparagingly over the useless trinkets my family
brings home from trips (and vice versa). My best suggestion is to give
any kids in your party a sum of money to spend and gentle reminders
that when it’s gone, it’s gone. Adults should pat themselves on the back
for contributing to the local economy, which is much appreciated, I’m
sure.
On the other hand, if you consider giving your credit card a workout a
necessary part of vacation, you’ve come to the right place. You’ll see
plenty of upscale chains and boutiques in San Francisco that you may
not find back home. Chapter 12 discusses where to shop, no matter
what your budget, and gives a few suggestions for finding low-cost gifts.
Nightlife
You can live large with seats for the ballet or nurse a beer in a Mission
District music club for under ten bucks — it just depends on your
predilections (and your budget). Chapters 15 and 16 cover some of the
entertainment options and tell you where to find all the local listings.
Taxing your wallet
Along with the more obvious expenses, such as souvenir bridges and
Escape from Alcatraz T-shirts, you have those little extras called taxes. In
our fair city, add sales tax of 8.5 percent to the price of just about every-
thing but snacks and take-out food. Additionally, a hotel tax of 14 per-
cent is added to the cost of your room, and an additional 14 percent
hikes up hotel valet parking fees. The good news is that most of the
money goes to fund local arts organizations, which makes it a bit more
palatable, I hope. Separate from the 15 percent to 20 percent tip servers
expect, many restaurants add a small surcharge to the bill to help cover
legally mandated employee health benefits.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 35

Cutting Costs — but Not the Fun
San Francisco can be expensive, but you can save money by following
some of these tips:
 Go in the off season. If you can travel at nonpeak times (Nov–Mar,
for example), you’ll find hotel prices almost half the rates you see
during peak months.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights. When you ask about air-
fares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by flying on a different day.
For more tips on getting a good fare, see Chapter 5.
 Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing just by
making one call to a travel agent or packager, for a price much less
than if you put the trip together yourself. (See Chapter 5 for more
on package tours.)
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs; several motels
have minifridges and coffeemakers. Buying supplies for breakfast
will save you money — and probably calories.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for sav-
ings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Ask if your kids can stay in the room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a queen-
size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional person
rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you. Even if
you have to pay $10 or $15 extra for a rollaway bed, you’ll save
hundreds by not taking two rooms.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs
are usually a fraction of what dinner would cost at a top restaurant,
and the menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Get out of town. In many places, big savings are just a short drive
or taxi ride away. Less conveniently located hotels can be great
bargains. Outlying motels often have free parking, with lower rates
than downtown hotels offering amenities that you may never use.
Sure, at a motel you’ll be carrying your own bags, but the rooms
are often just as comfortable and a whole lot cheaper. See Chapter
9 for more on hotels.
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper, and you
save on gas to boot. Unless you’re traveling with kids and need lots
of space, don’t go beyond the economy size. For more on car
rentals, see Chapter 7.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
36

 Don’t rent a car. The city is easily navigable on foot or by public
transit. You save as much as $50 a day on hotel parking by not
having a car, too.
 Ride public transportation, such as Muni or BART. Purchase a
Muni Passport and use it often (see Chapter 8).
 Walk a lot. A good pair of walking shoes can save lots of money on
taxis and other local transportation. As a bonus, you’ll get to know
your destination more intimately, as you explore at a slower pace.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories could be
the best mementos of your trip. If you’re concerned about money,
you can do without the T-shirts, key chains, salt-and-pepper shak-
ers, and other trinkets.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying
and which alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going
to change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving
around more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless
you happen to eat every meal out when you’re at home), and you may
let your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine), sometimes referred to as a “cash machine”
or “cashpoint.” The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com)
and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span the globe;
look at the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on, then
call or check online for ATM locations at your destination. Be sure you
know your personal identification number (PIN) before you leave home,
and be sure to find out your daily withdrawal limit before you depart.
Also keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time you use
your card at a different bank’s ATM. On top of this, the bank from which
you withdraw cash may charge its own fee. To compare banks’ ATM fees
within the U.S., use www.bankrate.com.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are safe and provide a convenient record of all your
expenses. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit cards
at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of
your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five
to seven business days, though some banks will provide the number
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 37

over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some
other personal information.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
(including San Francisco) have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw
small amounts of cash as needed. However, keep in mind that you will
likely be charged an ATM withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own, so
if you’re withdrawing money every day, you might be better off with
traveler’s checks.
You can buy traveler’s checks at most banks. They are offered in denom-
inations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and sometimes $1,000. Generally, you’ll
pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent. The most pop-
ular traveler’s checks are offered by American Express (% 800-807-
6233, or 800-221-7282 for cardholders — this number accepts collect
calls, offers service in several foreign languages, and exempts gold and
platinum cardholders from the 1 percent fee); Visa (% 800-732-1322);
and MasterCard (% 800-223-9920).
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
Be sure to tell all of your credit card companies the minute you discover
your wallet has been lost or stolen, and file a report at the nearest police
precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may require a police
report number or record of the loss. Most credit card companies have an
emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen; they may
be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an emergency
credit card in a day or two. Visa’s U.S. emergency number is % 800-847-
2911 or 410-581-9994. American Express cardholders and traveler’s check
holders should call % 800-221-7282. MasterCard holders should call 
% 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111. For other credit cards, call the toll-free
number directory at % 800-555-1212.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when banks and American
Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you through
Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
38

airline and explain the situation; you may be able to board your flight
home if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy
of the police report you’ve filed.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 39
Unearthing those hidden expenses
My credit-card bill never ceases to amaze me. I often wonder where half those charges
came from, and then reminisce fondly about the recent past as I dig through the state-
ment. You may not want to be reminded of your vacation in such a potentially harsh
manner — better to stick with photographs — but that means paying attention to
expenses that are less obvious than shelter and sustenance. For example, remember
that the cost of your hotel is more than the stated room rate. The total includes the 14
percent hotel tax, plus any minibar, telephone, bar, or room-service charges. Parking in
San Francisco can bankrupt you. Remember, too, minor items such as bridge tolls; San
Francisco sweatshirts times the number of people in your family who forgot to pack a
jacket; and tips for the bell staff, servers, and tour bus drivers (they add up quickly). Do
you have to kennel your dog? May as well include that, too.

Chapter 5
Getting to San Francisco
In This Chapter
 Flying to San Francisco
 Exploring other ways to get there
 Choosing an escorted or package tour
T
he Internet has made it possible for anyone to play travel agent. You
want to compare flight schedules and ticket prices? You want to take
a virtual tour of a hotel or restaurant? You want to purchase theater tick-
ets online? It’s getting easier by the day. Or would you rather let your
local travel agent make the calls? If you do use a travel agent, make sure
the agent has in-depth knowledge of the destination and isn’t just reserv-
ing the hotel that promises the largest commission. In-laws of mine (who
shall remain nameless) let their travel agent recommend the hotel on
their last trip to San Francisco, and it turned out to be a dump because
the agent hadn’t done her homework. The pitiful looks on their faces
made me want to hit them over their heads — with San Francisco For
Dummies, of course.
Flying to San Francisco
The most convenient airports to San Francisco are San Francisco
International (SFO), which is 14 miles south of downtown, and Oakland
International Airport (OAK), which is across the Bay Bridge, off
Interstate 880. SFO is closer, and more airlines fly into this major hub.
Oakland is smaller and easier to get in and out of, but you’ll pay about 
10 percent more for cab fares and 50 percent more for shuttles.
You can sometimes get a lower fare or a more convenient flight into
Oakland, so always compare prices and travel times for each airport.
Oakland also generally enjoys better weather than San Francisco. Foggy
conditions frequently delay flights into SFO, a fact worth remembering
as you mull over just how much reading material to bring with you on
the plane.
International travelers flying directly to the Bay Area don’t have a choice
of airports — it’s SFO or nothing. But the spacious International Terminal
has lots of good dining and shopping choices, plus convenient connec-
tions to BART and car-rental desks.

Finding out which airlines fly to San Francisco
Airlines that fly into SFO include:
 Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.ca)

 Virgin Atlantic Airways (% 800-821-5438; www.virgin-
atlantic.com)
Airlines that fly into Oakland International Airport include many of the
same carriers that serve SFO, plus JetBlue (% 800-538-2583; www.
jetblue.com) and Southwest Airlines (% 800-435-9792; www.
southwest.com).
Getting the Best Deal on Your Airfare 
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that in any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your
ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and travel midweek
(Tues–Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive price — usually a
fraction of the full fare. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
Search the Internet for cheap fares. The most popular online travel agen-
cies are Travelocity.com (www.travelocity.co.uk); Expedia.com
(www.expedia.co.uk and www.expedia.ca); and Orbitz.com. In the
U.K., go to Travelsupermarket (% 0845-345-5708; www.travel
supermarket.com), a flight search engine that offers comparisons for
the budget airlines whose seats often end up in bucket-shop sales. Other
Web sites for booking airline tickets online include Cheapflights.com,
Chapter 5: Getting to San Francisco 41

SmarterTravel.com, Priceline.com, and Opodo (www.opodo.co.uk).
Meta search sites (which find and then direct you to airline and hotel
Web sites for booking) include Sidestep.com and Kayak.com — the
latter includes fares for budget carriers like JetBlue as well as the major
airlines. Lastminute.com is a great source for last-minute flights and get-
aways. In addition, most airlines offer online-only fares that even their
phone agents know nothing about.
Watch local newspapers for promotional specials or fare wars, when
airlines lower prices on their most popular routes. Also keep an eye on
price fluctuations and deals at Web sites such as Airfarewatchdog.com
and Farecast.com.
Frequent-flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but membership may
entitle you to better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and
prompter service if your luggage is stolen or your flight is canceled or
delayed, or if you want to change your seat (especially after you’ve
racked up some miles). And you don’t have to fly to earn points; frequent-
flier credit cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing your every-
day shopping. With more than 70 mileage awards programs on the
market, consumers have never had more options. Investigate the pro-
gram details of your favorite airlines before you sink points into any one.
Consider which airlines have hubs in the airport nearest you, and, of
those carriers, which have the most advantageous alliances, given your
most common routes. To play the frequent-flier game to your best
advantage, consult the community bulletin boards on FlyerTalk (www.
flyertalk.com) or go to Randy Petersen’s Inside Flyer (www.inside
flyer.com). Petersen and friends review all the programs in detail and
post regular updates on changes in policies and trends.
Driving to San Francisco
You can get to San Francisco by driving along three major highways.
Interstate 5 runs through the center of the state. This route intersects
with Interstate 80, which goes over the Bay Bridge into the city. Getting
to San Francisco from Los Angeles along Interstate 5 takes about six
hours. The other major route you can take is Highway 101, which heads
from Los Angeles through San Francisco (about seven hours) to Marin
County, Napa, Sonoma, and other points north. Highway 1 is the more
scenic coastal route, which takes you closer to Monterey and Santa
Cruz. It’s lovely, but the trip from Los Angeles takes a lot longer —
approximately eight to ten hours.
Arriving by Other Means
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245 or 800-USA-RAIL; www.amtrak.com) doesn’t
stop in San Francisco proper, but it does stop in Emeryville, a small town
just south of Berkeley. Passengers then ride an Amtrak bus (which
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
42

departs shortly after each train arrives) from Emeryville to the Ferry
Building or the Caltrain station in downtown San Francisco.
Traveling by train may seem romantic, but don’t assume it’s cheaper
than flying. At this writing, the lowest round-trip train fare from Los
Angeles to San Francisco is $100, which is more expensive than a 14-day
advance-purchase ticket on one of the airlines serving the Los Angeles–
San Francisco corridor. The trip from Chicago takes two days and costs
at least $145 one way. But consider taking the train for the experience of
chugging across the country, if you have the time, or if you’re like my
mother-in-law, who flunked a workshop on getting over one’s fear of
flying. (She skipped the graduation flight.)
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect on
each leg of your journey. You know your costs upfront and, in the case of
the tame ones, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can take
you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time
with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour oper-
ator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you
paid for, there’s no reason to think it will fulfill its insurance obligations,
either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell you
more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 7.)
Depending on your budget, I recommend one of the following tour com-
panies: Globus (% 866-755-8581; www.globusjourneys.com), or Tauck
(% 800-788-7885; www.tauck.com), both of which offer week-long tours
to San Francisco and Wine Country. Tauck is the more upscale choice.
Escorted tours almost always encompass more than one city and, in the
case of these operators, can take in California highlights.
For more information on escorted general-interest tours, including ques-
tions to ask before booking your trip, see www.frommers.com/planning.
Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because tour operators buy packages in bulk and resell
them to the public. It’s kind of like buying your vacation at a warehouse
store — except the tour operator is the one who buys the 1,000-count
Chapter 5: Getting to San Francisco 43

box of garbage bags and resells them ten at a time at a cost that under-
cuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary widely. Some offer a better class of hotels than
others; others provide the same hotels for lower prices. Some book
flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charters. In some packages,
your choice of accommodations and travel days may be limited. Some
let you choose between escorted vacations and independent vacations;
others allow you to add a few excursions or escorted day trips (also at
discounted prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you; www.
libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast,
and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines — including American Airlines Vacations (% 800-321-
2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations (% 800-654-6559; www.
deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-
3800; www.covacations.com), and United Vacations (% 888-854-3899;
www.unitedvacations.com) — offer air/land packages. American
Airlines tends to have particularly good packages to San Francisco,
because it’s one of the airline’s hubs.
Several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, and
Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure
about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business
Bureau in the city where the company is based, or visit www.bbb.org. If
a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with that packager.
British travelers should check Travel Bag (% 0800-804-8911; www.
travelbag.co.uk).

trip, see www.frommers.com/planning.

Catering to Special Travel
Needs or Interests
In This Chapter
 Getting ready for a trip with the kids, San Francisco–style
 Going for high adventure for the disabled or senior traveler
 Checking out the scene for gay and lesbian travelers
A
h, don’t you long for the good old days when you could grab a
backpack, throw in a pair of jeans, and venture out into the world?
Now there’s the family to consider, with Junior needing to run around
and drain his batteries every few hours, your teenage daughter deter-
mined to track down the perfect pair of jeans, and your spouse needing
a break and maybe a beer. Or perhaps you have a physical limitation
that makes traveling a challenge. Or maybe you want to take advantage
of your status as an elder statesperson. Read on, friend! I like nothing
better than dispensing advice.
San Francisco, already celebrated as a haven for gay and lesbian visi-
tors, pretty much holds hajjlike status under the leadership of Mayor
Gavin Newsom. If you’re gay or lesbian, the resources I list in this chap-
ter will help you find areas of the city and entertainment venues that will
be of special interest to you.
Focusing on the Family
Babes in backpacks and strollers are a common sight on the streets of
San Francisco, so you can be assured that munchkins are welcome here.
But taking a vacation with your kids can sometimes mean you’re not
exactly on vacation, at least in my experience. Here are some tried-and-
true ways to make your trip as relaxed and enjoyable as possible.
Looking at the trip from a kid’s point of view
Before you board the plane or pack up the car, sit down with your family
and this book and go over the sights and activities listed in Chapter 11.
Let your kids choose three to six things to see and do (based on the

number of days you plan to stay in San Francisco), and then have them
rate their choices in order of preference. You do the same for the places
you want to visit. Next, fill a calendar with the days or times you plan to
do a kid activity and the times you plan to do something more adult-
oriented, such as enjoying the Museum of Modern Art or joining a walk-
ing tour (see Chapter 11). Remember to block out time for eating, snack-
ing, resting, and dropping by neighborhood parks.
Family trips are supposed to be fun, but kids turn cranky when exhaustion
sets in (doesn’t everybody?), so don’t pull them in a hundred different
directions. Neither you nor they need to see everything in one day. A long
afternoon in Golden Gate Park watching the squirrels may be more memo-
rable than dashing from Coit Tower to Alcatraz. Bring along books, paper,
crayons and pencils, perhaps an inexpensive camera, an iPod, or any
other unobtrusive, portable toys and games your children can easily
carry in their backpacks. Give kids their own copy of the itinerary that
your family worked out together to remind them that their time will come.
Finding kid-friendly sleeps, eats, and entertainment
Most hotels are more than happy to accommodate your entire clan.
Chapter 9 offers tips for figuring out what kind of accommodations are
right for you and yours.
Chapter 11 describes various places to go and things to do with young
kids as well as teenagers. If you’d like more direction, consider the itiner-
ary in Chapter 13 or look for the Frommer’s guide San Francisco with
Kids (published by Wiley Publishing). And don’t forget to look out for the
Kid Friendly icon to point you toward hotels, restaurants, and attrac-
tions that may especially appeal to the children. You’ll have no trouble
planning the perfect trip for tots, teens, and in-betweens.
Locating a baby sitter
You and your spouse or a friend may want to go out on the town without
the little, or not-so-little, ones in tow. Many hotels (particularly the
pricey ones) recommend baby-sitting services for their guests, although,
for liability reasons, you’ll have to make the arrangements. Rates vary,
as do add-ons, such as transportation and agency fees, but you can
expect to pay from $15 to $25 per hour with a four-hour minimum. Many
downtown hotels use Bay Area Child Care Agency (% 415-309-5662;
www.bayarea-childcare.com) and Bay Area 2nd Mom (% 888-926-
3666; www.2ndmom.com). Call at least a day or two in advance.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on Web sites like the
Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a comprehen-
sive resource that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel
Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning site that
offers travel features, deals, and tips; Traveling Internationally with
Your Kids (www.travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive site that
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
46

offers customized trip planning; and Family Travel Files (www.the
familytravelfiles.com), which offers an online magazine and a direc-
tory of off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for families.
Making Age Work for You: Advice for Seniors
Mention the fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel
reservations. Although the major U.S. airlines have cancelled their senior
discount programs, many hotels still give seniors a break. In most cities,
people over 62 qualify for reduced admission to theaters, museums, and
other attractions, as well as discounted fares on public transportation.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and
car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including
AARP The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
Another reason to celebrate reaching, or passing, 55 years is Elderhostel
(% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org). This organization provides
amazing travel/learning opportunities all over the world that may
encompass a weekend of art lectures and museum viewings or multiple
weeks on safari with the grandkids. Prices are reasonable and include
hotels, excursions, and most meals. San Francisco–based programs
include a six-day wine and food extravaganza with day trips to Napa
Valley. ElderTreks (% 800-741-7956; www.eldertreks.com) offers
small-group tours to off-the-beaten-path or adventure-travel locations,
restricted to travelers 50 and older.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts 
for seniors include: the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures
for the Mature Traveler (Avalon); and 101 Tips for Mature Travelers,
available from Grand Circle Travel (% 800-221-2610 or 617-350-7500).
Seniors 65 and older get automatic discounts on public transportation
fares in San Francisco. Just present identification showing your age for
reduced admission at movies, museums, and many other attractions.
Many tour companies also offer a discount for those over 62.

Accessing San Francisco: Advice 
for Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling. There are more
options and resources out there than ever before. Thanks to provisions
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 47

in the Americans with Disabilities Act, most public places are required
to comply with disability-friendly regulations. Almost all public estab-
lishments (including hotels, restaurants, and museums, but not certain
National Historic Landmarks), and at least some modes of public trans-
portation provide accessible entrances and other facilities for patrons
with disabilities.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; www.flying
wheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that emphasize
sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-Able Travel
Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) offers extensive
access information and advice for traveling around the world with dis-
abilities. Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.
accessiblejourneys.com) is an organization that provides travel plan-
ning resources and information for wheelchair travelers and their fami-
lies and friends.
Avis Rent A Car has an “Avis Access” program that offers such services
as a dedicated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customers
with special travel needs; car features such as swivel seats, spinner
knobs, and hand controls; and accessible bus service.
Organizations that offer assistance to travelers with disabilities include
MossRehab (www.mossresourcenet.org), which provides a library of
accessible-travel resources online; Society for Accessible Travel and
Hospitality (SATH; % 212-447-7284; www.sath.org; annual member-
ship fees: $45 adults, $30 seniors and students), which offers a wealth of
travel resources for all types of disabilities and informed recommenda-
tions on destinations, access guides, travel agents, tour operators, vehi-
cle rentals, and companion services; and the American Foundation for
the Blind (AFB; % 800-232-5463; www.afb.org), a referral resource for
the blind or visually impaired that includes information on traveling with
Seeing Eye dogs.
For more information, check out the quarterly magazine Emerging
Horizons ($14.95 per year, $19.95 outside the United States; www.
emerginghorizons.com) and Open World magazine, published online
by SATH.
The Bay Area–based Center for Independent Living publishes a 25-page
booklet, San Francisco Access, covering hotels, transportation options,
and other information helpful to travelers with disabilities. Request a
free copy from the San Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau (% 415-
391-2000; www.onlyinsanfrancisco.com). The organization also has a
fine Web site, www.accessnca.com, with detailed information on travel-
ing all around Northern California.
Touring on wheels
If you’re a wheelchair user, you’ll find San Francisco’s public areas quite
accessible. All sidewalks have curb cuts, and ramps permit easy on/off
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
48

access throughout the municipal railway system (Muni). You can find
some buses equipped with wheelchair lifts as well. For information on
public transportation accessibility, request a free copy of the Muni
Access Guide from Muni’s Accessible Services Program by phoning 
% 415-923-6142 or writing the program at 949 Presidio Ave., San
Francisco, CA 94115. If you need a ramped taxi, phone Yellow Cab at 
% 415-626-2345 — there’s no extra charge.
Many of the major car-rental companies now offer hand-controlled cars
for drivers with disabilities. Avis can provide such a vehicle at any of 
its locations in the United States with 48-hour advance notice; Hertz
requires notice between 24 and 72 hours in advance at most of its loca-
tions. Wheelchair Getaways (% 800-642-2042; www.wheelchair
getaways.com) rents specialized vans with wheelchair lifts and other
features for travelers with disabilities in more than 100 cities across the
United States.
Staying accessible
The Americans with Disabilities Act requires hotels to be much more
accessible than in the past. However, lodgings in old buildings may have
entry stairs, tiny elevators, narrow hallways, and minuscule bathrooms,
making them unsuitable for anyone having to maneuver in a wheelchair.
The Tuscan Inn near Fisherman’s Wharf and the Orchard Hotel near
Union Square (see Chapter 9) are somewhat newer properties that are
fully accessible. Also, look for the chain hotels, such as the Embarcadero
Hyatt Regency or Westin Market Street (see Chapter 9), that are
equipped to provide certain services such as TTY phones.
When making reservations, advise the reservation clerk at your hotel of
your needs — be it TTY phones or grip bars — to make your stay more
comfortable.
All newly built or restored restaurants are also up to date when it comes
to meeting requirements for accessible bathrooms and entrances. If you
have any doubts about access, ask when you call for a table.
Getting to the sights
You won’t have any problem accessing the main attractions in San
Francisco. Golden Gate Park is completely accommodating, as are the
museums, the Exploratorium, and many other sites. Some areas are not
very accessible, though (for example, places that have a series of stairs,
such as the Filbert Street Steps). Fort Point has a wheelchair ramp, and
its first floor is easily maneuverable; a walk or roll above Fort Funston is
also accessible for travelers with disabilities.
Anyone who would prefer to admire the hills without actually trekking
over them will appreciate the easy, flat walks that omit both stairs and
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 49

vertical climbs detailed by On the Level San Francisco Excursions. The
company publishes 20-page color booklets of self-guided walking tours
in various neighborhoods and parks, with historical highlights and help-
ful hints on parking and obstacles. Each booklet is $3.95 and for sale
online at www.onthelevelsf.com. Guided walks are also available for
$20 per person. Call % 415-921-1382 or check the Web site for informa-
tion on locations and schedules.

ties, go to www.frommers.com/planning.
Following the Rainbow: Advice for 
Gay and Lesbian Travelers
San Francisco is an important and historic destination for gay travelers.
You’ll find the majority of gay bars and inns in the Castro District, the
heart of San Francisco’s gay community. The lesbian community resides
mostly in portions of Noe Valley and the Mission District (with Valencia
Street as the main drag).
Check out these great Web sites for your trip planning: Gay.com (www.
gay.com) and Citysearch (www.sanfrancisco.citysearch.com),
which has a complete section devoted to gay and lesbian nightlife and
an interesting history of the Castro. Also take a look at the handy print
guide GayPocket San Francisco (www.gaypocketusa.com). You can
obtain a free copy of this quarterly pint-sized must-have throughout the
Castro, or order one by mail: Send a $5 check to Gay Pocket Guides,
2215-R Market St., PMB 500, San Francisco, CA 94114. When you get to
the city, pick up a copy of the Bay Area Reporter for comprehensive
entertainment listings. It’s free and available at coffeehouses, in book-
stores, and around the Castro.
For information on specific hotels that cater to gay visitors, check out
Frommer’s San Francisco (Wiley Publishing). But there aren’t any com-
pelling reasons to plunk yourself down in such a hotel unless you don’t
intend to leave the Castro. And if that’s the case, you’ll be missing out 
on the alternative gay scene South of Market (see Chapter 16).
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry and offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to its Web site and click on
“Members.”
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681 or 760-
325-0702; www.abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian
tour operator for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951 or
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
50

415-626-1169; www.nowvoyager.com) is a well-known San Francisco–
based gay-owned and -operated travel service.
The following travel guides are available at many newsstands, most
travel bookstores, and gay and lesbian bookstores: Out and About
(% 415-834-6500; www.outandabout.com), which offers guidebooks
and a newsletter ($20 per year; ten issues) packed with solid information
on the global gay and lesbian scene; Spartacus International Gay
Guide (Bruno Gmünder Verlag; www.spartacusworld.com/gayguide)
and Odysseus, both good, annual English-language guidebooks focused
on gay men; the Damron guides (% 800-462-6654 or 415-255-0404; www.
damron.com), with separate, annual books for gay men and lesbians;
and Gay Travel A to Z: The World of Gay & Lesbian Travel Options
at Your Fingertips by Marianne Ferrari (Ferrari International; Box
35575, Phoenix, AZ 85069), a very good gay and lesbian guidebook
series.

Taking Care of the
Remaining Details
In This Chapter
 Buying travel insurance — or not
 Dealing with illness away from home
 Deciding whether to drive
I
n case you need something to worry about, this chapter covers 21st-
century issues such as whether or not you need travel insurance,
what to do if you fall ill, and how to deal with all those people staring at
your shoes in the airport security lines. I also flog my opinion about
driving in San Francisco; whether you decide to get behind the wheel or
eschew driving in the city, you don’t want to miss my parking tips.
Renting a Car (or Six Reasons You Shouldn’t!)
If lots of traffic, steep hills, no parking spaces, one-way streets, crazy
bike messengers, and the occasional threat of a tow are your idea of 
fun, then get yourself a car. If you’d rather not deal with those sorts of
hassles (and did I mention overly enthusiastic parking enforcement
agents?), plenty of taxis are available to cart you all over the city.
San Francisco doesn’t have an enviable public-transportation system
like those in other cities; a bus can take you just about anywhere, slowly,
but the municipal railway system (Muni Metro) is fairly limited. The
Muni streetcars can get you close to where you want to go, but often
you’ll still need to catch a bus, grab a cab, or walk to many places.
However, because San Francisco neighborhoods are small and distinct,
and because you’ll find beautiful or bizarre happenings around every
corner, walking around is delightful.
Day-tripping: The one reason you should rent a car
If you plan on any out-of-city excursions, like wine tasting (if you don’t
like escorted tours, that is), you may want to rent a car. To avoid parking
fees, wait until the day of your trip to pick up your auto. Most companies,

including Enterprise Rent-A-Car (% 800-261-7331; www.enterprise.
com) can pick you up and drop you off at your hotel.
If you must rent: Getting the best rate
Car rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Asking a few key questions may save you hundreds of dollars.
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. If you’re keeping
the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the
daily rate. Ask if the rate is the same for pickup Friday morning as it
is Thursday night.
 Some companies may assess a drop-off charge if you don’t return
the car to the same rental location; others, notably National, don’t.
 Check whether the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at a loca-
tion in town rather than at the airport
 Find out whether age is an issue. Many companies add a fee for
drivers under 25, and some don’t rent to them at all.
 If you see an advertised price in your local newspaper, be sure to
ask for that specific rate; otherwise you may pay the standard
(higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA, AARP,
and trade unions. These memberships usually entitle you to dis-
counts ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your favorite (or at
least most-used) airlines likely to have sent you discount coupons,
but most car rentals add at least 500 miles to your account.
 As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can
make comparison shopping for a rental car much easier. You can
check rates at most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the
major travel sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and
Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com), for example — have
search engines that can dig up discounted car-rental rates. Just
enter the car size you want, the pickup and return dates, and loca-
tion, and the server returns a price. You can even make the reserva-
tion through any of these sites.
In addition to the standard rental prices, optional charges apply to most
car rentals (as do some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes). Many
credit card companies cover the Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which
requires you to pay for damage to the car in a collision. Check with your
credit card company before you go so you can avoid paying this hefty
fee (as much as $20 a day).
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 53

The car rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at home
probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if your
own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have auto
insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your car
rental agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around the Hope
diamond — and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk anyway —
you can probably skip the personal effects insurance, but driving around
without liability or personal accident coverage is never a good idea. Even
if you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and liability claims can
be complicated.
Some companies also offer refueling packages: You pay for your initial
full tank of gas upfront and can return the car with an empty tank. The
prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you don’t get credit
for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this option, you pay only
for the gas you use, but you have to return the car with a full tank or
face high charges for any shortfall. If you usually run late and a fueling
stop may make you miss your plane, you’re a perfect candidate for the
fuel-purchase option.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
The types of insurance that travelers are most likely to need are trip-
cancellation insurance and medical insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking. You can get estimates
from various providers through InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your trip cost
and dates, your age, and other information, for prices from more than a
dozen companies.
U.K. citizens and their families who make more than one trip abroad per
year may find an annual travel insurance policy cheaper than paying to
insure individual trips. Check www.moneysupermarket.com, which com-
pares prices across a wide range of providers for single- and multitrip
policies.
Most big travel agencies offer their own insurance and will probably try
to sell you a package when you book a holiday. Think before you sign.
Britain’s Consumers’ Association recommends that you insist on seeing
the policy and reading the fine print before buying travel insurance. The
Association of British Insurers (% 020-7600-3333; www.abi.org.uk)
gives advice by phone and publishes Holiday Insurance, a free guide to
policy provisions and prices. You might also shop around for better deals:
Try Columbus Direct (% 0870-033-9988; www.columbusdirect.net).

Here is my advice on trip-cancellation and medical insurance.
 Trip-cancellation insurance will help retrieve your money if you
have to back out of a trip or depart early, or if your travel supplier
goes bankrupt. Trip cancellation traditionally covers such events
as sickness, natural disasters, and State Department advisories.
The latest news in trip-cancellation insurance is the availability of
expanded hurricane coverage and of “any-reason” cancellation
coverage — which costs more but covers cancellations made for
any reason. You won’t get back 100 percent of your prepaid trip
cost, but you’ll be refunded a substantial portion. TravelSafe
(% 888-885-7233; www.travelsafe.com) offers both types of cov-
erage. Expedia also offers any-reason cancellation coverage for its
air-hotel packages. For details, contact one of the following recom-
mended insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.access
america.com); Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919;
www.travelguard.com); Travel Insured International (% 800-
243-3174; www.travelinsured.com); and Travelex Insurance
Services (% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip 
doesn’t make sense for most travelers. Most existing health poli-
cies cover you if you get sick away from home — but check before
you go, particularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
 International visitors to the U.S. should note that unlike many
European countries, the United States does not usually offer free or
low-cost medical care to its citizens or visitors. Doctors and hospi-
tals are expensive, and in most cases they require advance pay-
ment or proof of coverage before they render their services. Good
policies will cover the costs of an accident, repatriation, or death.
European automobile clubs and travel agencies sell packages such
as Europ Assistance’s “Worldwide Healthcare Plan” at attractive
rates. Worldwide Assistance Services, Inc. (% 800-777-8710; www.
worldwideassistance.com) is the agent for Europ Assistance in
the United States. Though lack of health insurance may prevent
you from being admitted to a hospital in nonemergencies, don’t
worry about being left on a street corner to die: The American way
is to fix you now and bill the daylights out of you later.
 If you’re ever hospitalized more than 150 miles from home, Medjet-
Assist (% 800-527-7478; www.medjetassistance.com) will pick
you up and fly you to the hospital of your choice in a medically
equipped and staffed aircraft 24 hours day, seven days a week.
Annual memberships are $225 individual, $350 family; you can also
purchase short-term memberships.
 Canadians should check with their provincial health plan offices or
call Health Canada (% 866-225-0709; www.hc-sc.gc.ca) to find out
the extent of their coverage and what documentation and receipts
they must take home in case they are treated in the United States.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 55

 Travelers from the U.K. should carry their European Health
Insurance Card (EHIC), which replaced the E111 form as proof 
of entitlement to free or reduced-cost medical treatment abroad
(% 0845-606-2030; www.ehic.org.uk). Note, however, that the
EHIC only covers “necessary medical treatment.” For repatriation
costs, lost money, baggage, or cancellation, look into travel insur-
ance from a reputable company (www.travelinsuranceweb.com).
Lost-luggage insurance
Lost-luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On domestic
flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per ticketed passenger.
If you plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see
if your homeowner’s policy covers your valuables, get baggage insur-
ance as part of your travel-insurance package, or buy Travel Guard’s
“BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insurance at the airport — it’s usually
overpriced. Be sure to take any valuables or irreplaceable items with
you in your carry-on luggage, because airline policies don’t cover many
valuables (including books, money, and electronics).
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the air-
port, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must report
delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival. The air-
lines are required to deliver luggage, once found, directly to your house
or destination free of charge.
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it (of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
56
Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis, or, as it’s known in the world of flying, “economy-class syndrome,”
is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. The potentially deadly condition can be caused
by sitting in cramped conditions, such as an airplane cabin, for too long. During a flight
(especially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and stretch your legs every 60 to 90
minutes. Other preventive measures include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drink-
ing lots of water, and avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills. If you have a history of deep vein
thrombosis, heart disease, or another condition that puts you at high risk, some experts
recommend wearing compression stockings or taking anticoagulants when you fly; always
ask your physician about the best course for you. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis
include leg pain or swelling, or even shortness of breath.

For information on purchasing additional medical insurance for your
trip, see the previous section.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart 
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance 
to Travelers (% 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, 416-652-0137; www.iamat.
org) for tips on travel and health concerns.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Using a Cellphone
If you’re not from the U.S., you’ll be appalled at the poor reach of the
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) wireless network,
which is used by much of the rest of the world. Your phone will probably
work in most major U.S. cities; it definitely won’t work in many rural
areas. To see where GSM phones work in the U.S., check out www.
t-mobile.com/coverage. And you may or may not be able to send 
SMS (text messaging) home.
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
If you have Web access while traveling, consider a broadband-based
telephone service (in technical terms, Voice over Internet protocol, or
VoIP) such as Skype (www.skype.com) or Vonage (www.vonage.com),
which allow you to make free international calls from your laptop or in a
cybercafe. Neither service requires the people you’re calling to have that
service (though there are fees if they do not). Check the Web sites for
details.
Accessing the Internet Away From Home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop, PDA (personal
digital assistant), or electronic organizer gives you the most flexibility.
But even if you don’t have a computer, you can still find ways to access
your e-mail and even your office computer.
Without Your Own Computer
I have seldom walked past our local Apple Stores (on Stockton and
Chestnut sts.) without seeing many, many “customers” checking their
e-mail on the various laptops on display. Public libraries also offer free
computer access, although you’ll be competing for a terminal with the
local homeless population. Besides the Main Library in Civic Center, pop
into the Chinatown branch, at 445 Grant St., or the North Beach branch,
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 57

at 2000 Mason St. Should you want to spend quality time online, you’ll
be better off paying for access and comfort. Quetzal Internet Cafe, 1234
Polk St., at Bush Street (% 415-673-4181) is open from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
weekdays and 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekends. It has a full menu and serves
fair-trade coffee.
With Your Own Computer
City Hall is working with a company called Meraki to provide free Wi-Fi
throughout San Francisco. You can check its progress if you get the urge
to log on in the Mission District, North Beach, and parts of SoMa. Look
for Free the Net on your computer’s list of available wireless networks
and give it a try. Almost all the hotels in town offer free Internet connec-
tion to their customers, with the exception of Starwood properties,
which continue to charge rather high fees. Lots of cafes advertise
Internet access, either free or for a small fee. One comfortable spots I
like is Caffe Roma, 526 Columbus Ave., in North Beach (% 415-296-7942;
www.cafferoma.com). Most Tully’s Coffee shops are wireless hotspots.
They’re all over the Financial District, including inside the Crocker
Galleria, 50 Post St. (% 415-956-8680; www.tullys.com/freewifi).
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an 
airline employee and he or she will probably whisk you to the front of
the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tickets have made paper tickets
nearly obsolete. Passengers with E-tickets can beat ticket-counter lines
by using airport electronic kiosks or even online check-in. Online
check-in involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your
reservation, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may
even offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport,
bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier
card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to
the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. Curbside check-
in is also a good way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban it;
call before you go.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
58

Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt buck-
les. If you have metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can prevent
a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only ticketed
passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting passen-
gers with disabilities or children, or meeting returning armed-forces
service members.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “per-
sonal item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders
can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in
it, it’s still considered a personal item. The TSA has issued a list of
restricted items; check its Web site (www.tssa.dhs.gov) for details.
Airport screeners may need to hand-search your checked luggage. Some
luggage locks allow screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-
searching is necessary. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage
or travel shops and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at
www.brookstone.com). For more information on the locks, visit www.
travelsentry.org.

Part III
Settling into 
San Francisco

In this part . . . 
B
ack in his student days, my husband was the kind of
traveler who would blithely arrive in some distant desti-
nation without any notion of where he would eat or sleep,
expecting that those things would somehow manage them-
selves. I, however, have always preferred the security of
knowing a pillow, an airplane seat, or a theater ticket has my
name on it. Go ahead and guess which one of us does the
travel planning.
The hard truth, especially for people like my spouse who
prefer, shall we say, to see the big picture, is that you have a
better trip when you solidify your plans prior to setting foot
on the airplane or the gas pedal. (Spontaneity is also a virtue,
but usually after your suitcase is unpacked and you have a
vague idea of where you are.) This part takes you from the
airport to the city, introduces you to the neighborhoods, and
explains how to use San Francisco’s public-transportation
system. If you’re driving, you can ﬂip directly to the tips for
upping your parking karma — you need it around San
Francisco! I also prod you to think about what you require in
the way of accommodations, so you can make a good match
with a hotel or motel. This part is also where you can get
some recommendations on where to go for a great meal at
any time of the day.

Arriving and Getting
Oriented
In This Chapter
 Figuring out how to get where you want to go
 Exploring the neighborhoods
 Gathering information
You can’t really glean much about a place from its airports and high-
ways. But as you head toward San Francisco, the industrial sites
and parking lots you pass gradually become the neighborhoods and
landmarks you may have seen in films and photographs or heard about
from fellow travelers. Even those of us who know the city as well as we
know our best friends can’t help but let out a sigh of delight when the
Golden Gate Bridge or the downtown skyline comes into view. Welcome
to San Francisco!
The Ins, but Especially the Outs, 
of Bay Area Airports
San Francisco International Airport (SFO) consists of four main termi-
nals: North (Terminal 3), South (Terminal 1), Central (Terminal 2), and
International. The baggage level of each terminal also houses informa-
tion booths. Bank of America operates a branch on the mezzanine level
of the North terminal, and you can find ATMs on the upper level of all
terminals. International visitors will find Travelex currency exchange
offices throughout the International terminal.
You can call the airport (% 800-435-9736 or 650-821-8211) for recorded
information, or % 650-817-1717 for transit information. The information
desk in each of the terminals can also give you information on how to
reach your destination. Or go to the SFO Web site, www.flysfo.com, for
more about the airport and ground transportation.

To reach your destination by taxi or shuttle, here are the specifics:
 Taxis line up for passengers at the center island outside the lower
level of the airport. The 14-mile trip to Union Square takes 20 to 
30 minutes or so, depending on traffic, and should cost around $35
to $45 plus tip.
 If you’re patient enough to wait 10 to 20 minutes for the one head-
ing to your neighborhood, shuttle vans offer door-to-door service
from the airport. However, the shuttle may make up to three stops
before it’s your turn to exit. You can find the shuttles by leaving the
airport from the upper level and heading to the center island out-
side the ticket counter nearest you. A guide will direct you. Look
for exact shuttle fares posted throughout the terminals; most
charge around $17 per passenger. Super Shuttle (% 415-558-8500;
www.supershuttle.com) is my personal favorite. You don’t need
to make reservations, but you will save a little money by doing so.
 Bay Area Rapid Transit, known as BART, connects travelers from
the airport to San Francisco, the East Bay, and the Millbrae Caltrain
Station, a few miles south of the airport. The BART fare into San
Francisco is $5.35. At Millbrae, you can board Caltrain and ride to
the depot at Fourth and King streets in San Francisco. The fare is 
a bargain at $4 for adults and $2 for children and seniors, and the
ride takes under 30 minutes. For the train schedule, go to www.
caltrain.com or call % 510-817-1717. BART airport stations are
on level 3 of the International terminal, or you can take the auto-
mated AirTrain to the Garage G/BART Station stop from the domes-
tic terminals.
 If you’re renting a car, the free AirTrain will transport you to the
building that holds all the counters and cars. Catch the AirTrain on
level 5 in any of the domestic terminal garages.
To drive yourself into town, follow the airport signs to Highway 101 North
and Highway 280. Stay toward the left, so you don’t end up on 280. If you
want to go to Union Square, exit 101 North at Fourth Street. Traffic is man-
ageable until rush hour, from 3 to 7 p.m.
At Oakland International (OAK; % 510-563-3300; www.flyoakland.
com), all ground transportation is on one level. A shuttle service called
Bayporter Express (% 415-467-1800; www.bayporter.com) picks up
passengers from Terminal 1 at the center island and from Terminal 2
around the corner from baggage claim. The fare to San Francisco is $29
for one person, $44 for two people in the same party, and $10 for kids
under 12. You’ll have an easier time if you make reservations for the 45-
to 60-minute ride. To take a cab downtown, expect to pay around $45;
the trip takes 30 to 40 minutes, depending on traffic. If you need cash,
you can find ATMs in the airport.
BART (% 510-465-2278; www.bart.gov) also runs from Oakland into
the city. You can catch the AirBART shuttle (% 510-430-9440), which
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
64

runs every 20 minutes, in front of Terminal 1 or 2. The fare (exact change
or prepaid ticket only) is $3 for adults, $1 for children and seniors for
the 15-to-30-minute ride to the Oakland Coliseum BART station. From
there, transfer to a BART train into San Francisco; the fare is $3.55.
Purchase your ticket from a kiosk inside the airport or at the BART sta-
tion. If you’re staying around Union Square, exit BART on Powell Street;
the trip takes about 25 minutes.
All the major rental-car counters are inside the terminals. If you’re driv-
ing into San Francisco, exit the airport on Hegenberger Road. Follow it
north to Highway 880 toward San Francisco. From there, follow the signs
to Highway 80 to San Francisco. When you reach the Bay Bridge, you’ll
have to pay $4 at the tollbooth. On the other side, exit on Fifth Street to
reach Union Square.
Arriving by Train or Car
Taking the train to San Francisco can be fun and romantic (as long as
you’re not in a hurry), and although I hope you’ll pay attention to my
advice not to drive in San Francisco, there’s no reason you shouldn’t
drive there and put the car away when you arrive.
By train
Amtrak trains arrive in Emeryville, just south of Berkeley. From there, 
an Amtrak bus will take you to downtown San Francisco. The buses 
stop at the Caltrain station, where there’s a Muni streetcar line to the
Embarcadero (and thus, into downtown), and at the Ferry Building. The
Ferry Building is more convenient to the hotels around the Embarcadero
and Fisherman’s Wharf. From the Caltrain station or the Ferry Building,
you can take a taxi or streetcar to Union Square or wherever.
By automobile
Drivers arriving from east of town will cross the Bay Bridge into 
downtown — have $4 ready for the toll collector. Cars coming from the
south on Highway 101 will pass Candlestick Park en route to downtown.
Anyone making the journey along Highway 101 from the north will enter
San Francisco on the Golden Gate Bridge. After you pass the tollbooth
(it’s $5 coming into the city), exit along the bay to Van Ness Avenue.
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
San Francisco is at the end of a 32-mile-long peninsula between the
Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. The city covers just 7 square miles.
Streets are laid out in a grid pattern, except for two major diagonal arter-
ies, Market Street and Columbus Avenue. Market cuts through town
from the Embarcadero up toward Twin Peaks. Columbus runs at an angle
through North Beach, beginning near the Transamerica Pyramid in the

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 67

Financial District and ending near the Hyde Street Pier. You’ll find num-
bered streets downtown, and numbered avenues in the Richmond and
Sunset districts southwest of downtown.
San Francisco neighborhoods are a diverse and interesting group. 
Of course, you’ll have no trouble distinguishing Union Square from
Chinatown, but even if you amble through largely residential neighbor-
hoods, you’ll notice distinct differences in the makeup of the residents
and the commercial establishments. The best way to immerse yourself
in the local culture is to pick a neighborhood and take a stroll.
This section gives you a general outline of the six most popular neigh-
borhoods to tour and lodge in, and the advantages and disadvantages 
of staying in each. I follow that with brief descriptions of other worthy
neighborhoods to explore. See the “San Francisco Neighborhoods” map
to orient yourself, and Chapter 11 for more on the major attractions in
these areas.
Union Square
The center of tourist activity, Union Square is tucked inside Sutter,
Grant, Market, and Mason streets. Big department stores, expensive bou-
tiques, theaters, restaurants, and the greatest concentration of hotels in
the city surround the square itself, which underwent a $25-million face-
lift in 2002. It lies on top of the very first underground garage in the
United States and features a central plaza outlined in palm trees, a good
cafe, outdoor tables, the TIX Bay Area outlet for half-price tickets, a See’s
Candy outlet, and a shop selling San Francisco–related necessities such
as sweatshirts, posters, and gifts.
Union Square is about as convenient as it gets. Chinatown, SoMa (South
of Market Street), and the Financial District are within easy walking dis-
tance, and public transportation can take you just about anywhere from
here. Buses, Muni, BART, and the Powell Street cable cars all run through
the area. You can even hail a cab on street corners in Union Square,
whereas in other parts of town you usually need to call for one. Urbanites
will love it.
On the downside, be prepared for heavy traffic and noise. Hotel rooms
are generally quiet, but you can often hear sirens piercing through the
walls or garbage trucks on their early-morning rounds. Most of the
hotels are in older buildings, which can be charming; however, this
means that the rooms and bathrooms often are somewhat small. Valet
parking in the area runs $30 to $50 a day.
Although Union Square sits next to the Tenderloin, a low-income neigh-
borhood of immigrant families, druggies, and the down-and-out, the area
is basically safe, as are most neighborhoods in San Francisco (see the
appendix for more information on safety). Because of the many locals
and tourists out and about, you do see plenty of street people and
vagrants aggressively seeking handouts. Pickpockets can be a problem,
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
68

and women shouldn’t walk around unescorted at night. Certain sections
of the Tenderloin should be avoided at any time.
The benefits of staying in Union Square include the following:
 Chinatown is around the corner.
 You have dining, shopping, and nightlife all in one place.
 Public transportation is excellent.
But here are the drawbacks:
 You’re right near the Tenderloin.
 The traffic is relentless during the day.
 The panhandling can get on your nerves.
Nob Hill
Just above Union Square is Nob Hill, one of the oldest and most fashion-
able addresses in town. Enveloping California Street from Leavenworth to
Stockton and overlooking the Financial District, the area boasts beautiful,
upper-crust residential apartments and the majestic Grace Cathedral.
You can find the swanky Pacific Heights neighborhood (home to the
Gettys and author Danielle Steel) to the west. A small selection of plush
hotels cascades down the hill toward the Financial District, along with
the California Street cable-car line.
Nob Hill accommodations are pricey, with good reason. They offer a
quiet, sophisticated, residential atmosphere that contrasts with the
hustle and bustle of Union Square and Fisherman’s Wharf. Here you see
well-dressed business travelers and tourists going about their business,
in contrast to the panhandlers and down-and-outers hanging around
Market Street. Nob Hill is also quite safe, even at night. Although you will
be walking up and down very steep grades, Nob Hill is really just a short
stroll from Union Square. Muni buses and the California Street cable car
provide public transportation connections. And access to some of the
city’s finest bars and restaurants is often just an elevator ride away. Nob
Hill streets also offer breathtaking views of downtown.
The benefits of staying in Nob Hill include the following:
 The area is very safe.
 It’s more peaceful and residential than Union Square.
But here are the drawbacks:
 You need to be in good condition to walk up and down the hills.
 It’s expensive.
 Fewer shops and restaurants are nearby.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 69

SoMa
South of Market Street (or SoMa for short) between Tenth, King, and
Steuart streets has exploded in the past two decades, particularly 
along Mission Street between Second and Fifth. The George Moscone
Convention Center, on Howard Street between Third and Fourth, pio-
neered the renaissance of this section of downtown. The San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art, the Cartoon Art Museum, Yerba Buena
Gardens (see Chapter 11), and, most recently, high-rise condos fol-
lowed. Clubs have multiplied around Harrison Street; restaurants and
bars are thick from Howard Street down to the tiny South Park enclave.
Still, vestiges of the old neighborhood remain. On nearby Sixth Street
you’ll find seedy residential hotels and corner stores specializing in
cheap wine. Market Street itself is depressing west of Sixth Street — a
combination of low-rent tourist shops, peep shows, and check-cashing
counters, with a few legitimate theaters. And you’re competing for space
in hotels with thousands of guys wearing plastic name tags and rushing
to Moscone for that panel discussion on skeletal malocclusions.
The benefits of staying in SoMa include the following:
 It’s center stage for cutting-edge art and performance.
 Many museums cluster around Yerba Buena Center.
 Some great restaurants and clubs are in the area.
But here are the drawbacks:
 It still has a fringe element about it.
 The hotel choices are more limited than around Union Square.
 You get lots of convention traffic.
The Embarcadero
Liberated from the pylons and cement of the Embarcadero Freeway,
which was damaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and subse-
quently torn down, the Embarcadero now glows in the light reflected off
the waters of the bay. Paralleling the eastern edge of Fisherman’s Wharf
to the beginning of China Basin, the lovely stretch of road wraps around
the northeast side of the city. The views it offers are some of the most
sigh-inducing in town — the Bay Bridge soars above you, Alcatraz seems
a mere stone’s throw away, and on sunny weekends, sailboats blissfully
glide around the bay. The newly remodeled Ferry Building, a fitting cen-
terpiece at the end of Market Street, contains the best of the best food
purveyors.
This is a very safe area and is generally quiet in the evenings, except
during rush hour, when it’s a major thoroughfare for bridge traffic. The
most popular activities at the Embarcadero consist of promenading
slowly down Herb Caen Way (a stretch of sidewalk near the Ferry
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
70

Building named for the San Francisco Chronicle’s legendary columnist),
jogging, biking, skateboarding, and shopping. With the Ferry Building
drawing the locals, sections of the Embarcadero are as lively as Union
Square. Some of the hottest kitchens are here, too, and you can find
music and nightlife in unexpected venues.
Financial District workers swarm the Embarcadero Center, a collection
of five multiuse office and retail buildings connected by bridges and
walkways. Independent and foreign film lovers should check out
Landmark’s five-screen theaters in Embarcadero Center 1. You can catch
BART and Muni streetcars from the Embarcadero underground station
to just about anywhere. A Muni extension from the Embarcadero to the
Caltrain station rolls southeast past the magnificent downtown ballpark,
and charming old streetcars breeze down Market Street, turn northwest
toward Fisherman’s Wharf, and run back. As for accommodations, the
hotels are expensive. The neighborhood’s popularity is apparent in the
amount of building and remodeling completed around the waterfront.
The benefits of staying in the Embarcadero include the following:
 Well-placed hotel rooms enjoy beautiful bay views.
 The location is great for strollers and joggers.
 Public transportation options are excellent.
 Shopping and dining are convenient.
But here are the drawbacks:
 Rush-hour traffic is heavy.
 Hotel choices are limited (and expensive).
 Walks to other neighborhoods are relatively long.
North Beach/Fisherman’s Wharf
Although just a few blocks separate North Beach from Fisherman’s
Wharf, the neighborhoods are as different as focaccia and sourdough.
North Beach isn’t an actual beach — it’s the old Italian neighborhood
next to Chinatown. Head here to sit in cafes, to browse in City Lights
bookstore, and to sample the selections at the various delis and pastry
shops. Columbus Avenue is the main street, but you can find family-style
restaurants and crowded bars from Washington to Grant. XXX-rated
clubs stick together on Broadway; Telegraph Hill is to the east, behind
Coit Tower and the Filbert steps.
North Beach is the most European of any neighborhood in town, and the
one in which I’d most like to wake up. Ducking into a cafe for a cappuc-
cino, choosing a pastry from any number of Italian bakeries, watching
Chinese senior citizens practicing tai chi in Washington Square Park —
what a heavenly way to pass the morning. Stores sell goods you haven’t
already seen a thousand times over, and the food is divine and diverse.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 71

And then there’s Fisherman’s Wharf. I suppose 15.7 million tourists can’t
all be wrong, but just between you and me, I don’t get it. Located on Bay
Street between Powell and Polk streets, the piers were once the center
of the city’s harbor and fishing industries. Now, waterfront life is limited
to a few sport-fishing boats for tourist attractions, and the sounds of
cash registers have usurped the old-timers.
A group of chain hotels huddles around North Point Street, about two
blocks from the Hyde Street cable-car turnaround. A walk west along 
the waterfront, through the most tourist-oriented section, ends at the
delightful Aquatic Park, but along the way, you pass a gauntlet of T-shirt
emporiums, fast-food eateries, knick-knack shops, and beggars, one of
whom camouflages himself with branches and jumps out at unsuspect-
ing pedestrians — I kid you not.
As you may guess, prices are slightly lower off-season in North Beach
and Fisherman’s Wharf, but so is the safety factor. Watch your wallet,
particularly around PIER 39. Auto break-ins are also a problem.
Depending on the weather, North Beach can be raucous during the
evening, and blocks of Broadway pulsate with bars and girlie clubs.
Parking in either district is impossible unless you head for the nearest
garage, which can get expensive.
The benefits of staying in Fisherman’s Wharf/North Beach include the
following:
 You can navigate your way through either location on foot.
 You can find plenty of great meals in North Beach.
 You have access to convenient public transportation.
But here are the drawbacks:
 You’re surrounded by tourists on Fisherman’s Wharf.
 The parking is a nightmare.
 Hotel choices are limited.
The Marina/Cow Hollow
Between Van Ness Avenue, Broadway Street, Lyon Street, and Marina
Boulevard is the Marina/Cow Hollow neighborhood, a residential utopia
for singles of all ages. In these parts, you’ll find famous Union Street and,
4 blocks farther north, Chestnut Street, both popular for their trendy
shops, restaurants, and young urban professionals. Architecture and his-
tory fans can get a close look at the Octagon House (circa 1861) at 2645
Gough St. (at Union).
If you’re driving to San Francisco or renting a car while you’re here, this
neighborhood has its advantages. Outdoorsy types love the location,
which is close to the Presidio and Crissy Field. Most, but not all, of the
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
72

accommodations here include free parking. You can walk to several great
sights from the Marina/Cow Hollow area, including the Exploratorium,
the Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Mason, and the Golden Gate Bridge. This
is a good neighborhood for families, because the prices are more reason-
able than in more tourist-oriented areas.
The downside of staying here is also the location. The majority of lodg-
ings in the area are motels along Lombard Street, a four- to six-lane con-
duit to the Golden Gate Bridge and Van Ness Avenue and the busiest
street in the city. Most visitors find the traffic horrendous. A few hotels
lie off the main drag (I review some in Chapter 9), but great places to
stay are somewhat hard to find.
The benefits of sleeping in the Marina/Cow Hollow area include the 
following:
 It’s near Chestnut Street and Union Street shopping.
 Hotel and motel parking is usually free.
 It’s within walking distance of the Marina and the Golden Gate
Bridge.
But here are the drawbacks:
 Accommodations choices are almost exclusively motels and B&Bs.
 Traffic is heavy on Lombard Street.
 The immediate surroundings are less scenic.
Other ’hoods to discover
If you really want to get to the heart of San Francisco, make your way to
the districts discussed below.
The Castro
A historic and active gay community is the Castro’s claim to fame.
Visitors can admire the beautifully restored Victorian homes, visit the
Castro Theatre, and try out a new image in the superb men’s clothing
stores. For shopping and people-watching, head to Castro Street,
between Market and 18th streets.
China Basin/Mission Bay
This neighborhood is old, but before the Giants relocated here, visitors
had no reason to explore the area. Boy, have things changed: The area
teems with new offices and live/work developments. King Street from
Third Street to the Embarcadero is the main drag; that’s where you can
find restaurants, bars, and the boys of summer. West of Third Street
along the water is the new Mission Bay development, featuring UCSF’s
latest campus for research and teaching, condos galore, and an entirely
new neighborhood to serve them.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 73

Chinatown
The borders of Chinatown are always in a state of flux, but this densely
packed area lies roughly between Broadway, Taylor, Bush, and
Montgomery streets. It is every bit as vivid and fascinating as adver-
tised. The Dragon Gate entrance on Grant Avenue leads to touristy
shops, but you’ll swear you’re in another country after you wander up
Stockton and down the abundant alleyways.
Civic Center and Hayes Valley
If you’re seeking the New Main Library; the Asian Art Museum; the
Ballet, Symphony, and Opera buildings; or City Hall, then Civic Center,
bordered by Van Ness and Golden Gate avenues, and Franklin, Hyde, and
Market streets, is where you want to be.
This neighborhood has a large homeless population and is dicey after
dark. If you have plans in the area at night, I recommend taking a cab.
Hayes Valley, west of Civic Center, is bounded by Franklin Street to the
east, Webster Street to the west, Grove Street to the north, and Page
Street to the south. Here you’ll find trendsetting places to shop and
many quality restaurants.
Financial District
The Financial District encompasses prime bay real estate roughly
between Montgomery Street and the Embarcadero, on either side of
Market Street. The Transamerica Pyramid, at Montgomery and Clay
streets, is a skyline landmark. Seek out Belden Place, an alley between
Kearny, Bush, and Pine streets, for outdoor dining opportunities.
Antiques hounds will like the hunting grounds around Jackson Square.
Haight-Ashbury
The Haight, or Haight-Ashbury, is surrounded by Stanyan Street to the
east, Divisadero Street to the west, Fulton Street to the north, and Waller
Street to the south. The area still hasn’t fully recovered from what must
have been a bummer to some of its residents — the demise of the ’60s.
You can find most of the action on Haight Street, which retains its magi-
cal appeal to scruffy groups of youngsters campaigning for handouts.
Used-clothing stores compete for space with all kinds of commercial
endeavors, most of which are perfectly legit.
Japantown
Off Geary, between Webster and Laguna streets, is Japantown, which at
first glance appears to consist of ugly indoor shopping centers. Look
closer and you’ll find some good, inexpensive noodle restaurants and
interesting shops in these buildings. A revitalized section of Fillmore
Street lies within walking distance. Check out the Sundance Kabuki
movie theaters here, or soak at the Kabuki Hot Springs. Across Sutter
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
74

Street (between Fillmore and Webster), look for Cottage Row, the last
morsel left of the old Japantown. Bus service to Union Square is efficient
and easy.
The Mission District
Located from Cesar Chavez Street to Market Street, between Dolores and
Potrero streets, the Mission District is a busy, largely Hispanic commu-
nity home to a growing number of artsy types seeking cheap (well, rela-
tively cheap) rentals. Check out Mission Dolores, Dolores Park, and 24th
Street, along with a plethora of affordable restaurants and eye-catching
outdoor murals. A growing multitude of restaurants operates on Valencia
and Guerrero streets between 16th and 23rd streets, and on 16th Street
between Mission and Guerrero.
Pacific Heights
Pacific Heights, which is bordered by Broadway, Pine, Divisadero, and
Franklin streets, is where the wealthy lounge around their extravagant
but tasteful homes. You can visit the Haas-Lilienthal House, an 1886
Queen Anne Victorian at 2007 Franklin St., at Washington, and stare at
Mrs. Doubtfire’s fictional digs at Broadway and Steiner. The closest shop-
ping blocks are Fillmore Street between Jackson and Pine streets.
The Presidio
These 1,500 acres on the westernmost point of the city are part of the
Golden Gate National Recreation Area. If you love to hike, go to the visi-
tor center for maps and suggestions — the views and landscape are sen-
sational. If you’d rather play tenpins, a great little bowling alley is also
here. A patch of Presidio land along the bay, a park named Crissy Fields,
features wetlands, picnic areas, bay views, and a drop-in center with week-
end activities. That collection of buildings facing the bay belongs to
George (Star Wars) Lucas and is the Letterman Digital Arts Center campus.
The Richmond District
Stretching from Golden Gate Park at one edge to the Pacific Ocean at
the other, this large neighborhood is home to Lincoln Park, Land’s End,
the California Palace of the Legion of Honor museum, and the recently
remodeled Cliff House. Clement Street is akin to Chinatown, without the
fun architecture or alleyways, and you can find authentic Russian food
on Geary.
Russian Hill
Polk Street from Broadway up to around Greenwich Street has become
très chic. This is a delightful area for shopping and snacking, with some
terrific little restaurants, bakeries, antiques shops, and boutiques. Just
to the northwest, you’ll find the wiggly part of Lombard Street and
Macondry Lane, immortalized in Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 75

The Tenderloin
The blocks bounded by Sutter and Mason streets and Van Ness and
Golden Gate avenues are a section of town currently home to immigrant
families — largely from Southeast Asia — attempting to live their lives
alongside flophouses, bars, massage parlors, and people subsisting 
on the fringes of society. A slim rectangle of real estate from roughly
O’Farrell to Market streets between Larkin and Polk is dangerous at
night and rough during the day. The only place worth visiting here is
Glide Memorial Church for Sunday services, although the city is pro-
moting the growing presence of Vietnamese restaurants.
The Western Addition
I mention this old neighborhood between Geary, Haight, Gough, and
Divisadero streets because people studying their maps often believe it’s
an easy walk from Civic Center to Golden Gate Park by way of Oak or Fell
streets. That’s not entirely accurate. First, it’s hilly. Second, it’s not the
safest section of town. And third, it’s much farther than it appears.
Finding Information After You Arrive
If you need more information about the city, ask your concierge or desk
clerk; stop by the Convention and Visitors Bureau Information Center
on the lower level of Hallidie Plaza, 900 Market St. (at Powell); or call 
% 800-220-5747 or 415-391-2000. The office is open Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
during the summer. It’s closed New Year’s Day, Easter Sunday,
Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Sundays from November to April.
Look for a free Bay Guardian or SF Weekly at sidewalk kiosks and coffee-
houses for listings of city events and entertainment. The Convention and
Visitors Bureau also operates a 24-hour events line at % 415-391-2001.
Getting Around San Francisco
Having a car in the city isn’t advised and isn’t necessary most of the
time. San Francisco really caters to walkers, with benches appearing just
when you need one and cafes at hand for a shot of caffeine when energy
flags. Getting around on a bus or Muni metro streetcar is cheap if not
perfect. In the rare instance that you do need a car, renting one down-
town is easy and convenient.
This section contains everything you need to know about cruising
around the city sans auto. It even includes some inside tips on parking
should you decide to throw caution to the wind and join the legendary
drivers — and I don’t mean that in a good way — gracing our city’s
roads and highways.

The one-stop-shopping number for traffic or public transit information is
% 415-817-1717. This number connects you to whatever you need,
whether BART and Muni routes or traffic conditions.
Heading Out on Foot
Walking is the best way to travel if you aren’t in a rush, and it’s the only
way to really see and enjoy the neighborhoods. I recommend some walk-
ing tours in Chapter 11, and I can’t urge you enough to take one or more.
Walking is the only means of seeing the city properly, and if you get a
good tour guide, you’ll discover some interesting tidbits as well.
Use caution when walking, because San Francisco is no stranger to 
vehicle-pedestrian accidents. Be alert at all times. Watch for drivers 
running red lights (a common occurrence) or turning right on a red light;
make absolutely sure bus drivers see you entering the crosswalk.
Among the best neighborhoods for walkers are Chinatown, North Beach,
Russian Hill, and the Embarcadero. If you’re in good shape and don’t
mind a little wind, a walk across the Golden Gate Bridge is much more
satisfying than a drive, especially if you’re the one who has to keep your
eyes on the road.
Traveling by Streetcar
Walking probably won’t take you everywhere you want to go. But getting
around by public transportation is a breeze when you know a few basics.
The San Francisco Municipal Railway, known as Muni (% 415-673-6864;
www.sfmta.com), is much maligned by locals for inefficiency, but tens of
thousands of daily commuters rely on its buses and electric streetcars
for a lift to the office. The fare is $1.50 for an adult and 50¢ for seniors 65
and older and children 5 to 17 to ride a bus or streetcar anywhere in the
system; exact change is required. Muni Passports, accepted on buses,
streetcars, and even cable cars, are a bargain for visitors planning to take
public transportation extensively. A one-day pass is $11, a three-day pass
is $18, and a seven-day pass is $24. You can purchase them at the Tix Bay
Area booth in Union Square, at the cable-car ticket booth on Market and
Powell streets, at the Beach and Hyde streets cable-car ticket booth, and
even the Walgreens at 825 Market St. (at Fourth St.). You may also pur-
chase single-day passes onboard the cable cars.
A Citypass (% 888-330-5008; www.citypass.net) is a booklet of dis-
counted tickets for six major attractions (the Museum of Modern Art,
Palace of the Legion of Honor/de Young museums, California Academy
of Sciences & Steinhart Aquarium or the Asian Art Museum, the
Exploratorium, Aquarium of the Bay, and a Blue & Gold Bay Cruise).
The pass includes a seven-day Muni Passport, making it quite a bargain
for those ambitious enough to use all the coupons — they’re good for
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 77

nine days from the date of purchase. The price is $54 for adults, $44 for
kids, and you can buy a pass online or at the participating attractions.
At the underground Muni stops from Civic Center to the Embarcadero,
the fare boxes (which are at the entry point prior to reaching the escala-
tors) accept only coins or tokens, an important point to remember if
you’re in a hurry and have only dollar bills in hand. Change machines
are on the walls next to the BART ticket dispensers.
Muni streetcars run underground downtown and aboveground in the
outlying neighborhoods from 6 a.m. until 1 a.m. The five Muni metro
streetcar lines — the J, K, L, M, and N — make the same stops as BART
(see the discussion later) along Market Street, including Embarcadero
Station, Montgomery and Powell streets (both near Union Square), Civic
Center, and Van Ness Avenue. Past Van Ness Avenue, the routes go off in
different directions. The N-Judah line serves Haight-Ashbury and paral-
lels Golden Gate Park on its way down Judah Street to the ocean. The 
J-Church line passes close to Mission Dolores and the Castro. The 
L-Taraval line travels through the Sunset District within walking distance
of the San Francisco Zoo. The new T-Third streetcar operates as an
extension to the K line, connecting all the Third Street neighborhoods.
A collection of vintage streetcars from the United States and Europe
operates on the most picturesque line, the F-Market. It runs along
Market Street to the Castro Street station. The rejuvenated cars continue
from Market Street over to Mission Street and down the Embarcadero to
Fisherman’s Wharf. Muni cars marked MISSION BAY end their journey at the
Caltrain Station on King Street, just past the AT&T baseball park. These
streetcars have their own fan club, the nonprofit Market Street Railway,
which operates a tiny new museum at 77 Steuart St. (% 415-974-1948;
open: Wed–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m.), where the line stops. Trainspotters will
find it moving.
Spend the $3 for the Official San Francisco Street and Transit Muni Map.
It is invaluable for public transportation users. It shows all bus, street-
car, cable-car, and BART routes and stations. You can buy the maps at
the Convention and Visitors Bureau Information Center and cable-car
ticket booths. You can also call % 415-673-MUNI for route information.
Trekking by Bus
Muni buses are clearly numbered on the front and run through the city
from 6 a.m. to midnight. I don’t recommend taking them late at night,
however. Street-corner signs and painted yellow bands on utility poles
and on curbs mark bus stops. Buses come by every 5 to 20 minutes,
depending on where you want to go and the time of day. Rapid transit —
in the truest sense of the adjective — they are not, but with 80 routes,
they are the most complete. Muni metro streetcars are faster, but the
buses cover a wider area. Expect most buses to be extremely crowded
during rush hours (from 7–9 a.m. and 4–6 p.m.).
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
78

Exact change is required on the buses, as it is on the streetcars (for
information on fares, see the section “Traveling by Streetcar,” earlier in
this chapter). Ask the driver for a transfer, which is good for a second
ride within 90 minutes. If you plan to ride another bus or streetcar
within the time limit, you’ll be happy to have that slip of paper.
Befriending BART
BART (% 415-989-2278; www.bart.gov), which stands for Bay Area
Rapid Transit, is not Muni. Tourists often get the two systems mixed up
because they share the same underground stations downtown. You
won’t get into too much trouble if you get the systems confused within
the city limits, but BART runs all over the Bay Area, and if you’re inatten-
tive, you may end up in a place far different from where you expected to
go. More than one unsuspecting traveler has ended up in Fremont when
he intended to exit at the Embarcadero. If BART is what you want, check
the signs in the stations and pay attention to the cars themselves. The
silver-and-blue BART trains do not resemble Muni’s orange-trimmed
electric streetcars in the least. You purchase tickets for BART from
machines at the station. The fare to or from any point in the city is $1.55
each way; outside the city, fares vary depending on how far down the
line you go. You can’t use Muni transfers, tokens, or passes on BART.
Getting Around by Cable Car
There’s no city statute that says you have to ride the cable cars, but
what self-respecting tourist would leave San Francisco without climbing
aboard? Three lines cross the downtown area. If you’re in the mood for
some scenery, take the Powell-Hyde line, which begins at Powell Street
and ends at the turnaround across from Ghirardelli Square. The Powell-
Mason line goes through North Beach and ends near Fisherman’s Wharf.
The California Street line, the least scenic, crests at Nob Hill and then
makes its way to Van Ness Avenue. (The lines of people waiting to board
the California Street cable cars are usually much shorter than the others
because the route isn’t as twisty.) Rides are $5 one-way, so buy a Muni
Passport and take all three as often as you like. The pass is worth every
penny. You may board cable cars only at specific, clearly marked stops.
Cable cars operate from 6:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., but I suggest taking one
early or late in the day if you want to have a little elbow room. Plus, the
fare is only $1 before 7 a.m. and after 9 p.m.
Catching a Taxi
You can easily get a taxi downtown, especially in front of hotels, but you
have to call a cab to retrieve you almost anywhere else. Unfortunately,

reaching the taxi companies by phone can take a while. Keep these num-
bers handy:
 Desoto Cab: % 415-970-1300
 Luxor Cabs: % 415-282-4141
 Veteran’s Cab: % 415-648-1313
 Yellow Cab: % 415-626-2345
Rates are about $3.10 for the first 1⁄5 mile and 45¢ for each additional 
1⁄5 mile or fraction thereof.
Motoring Around on Your Own
Drivers unfamiliar with the area often have a difficult time navigating the
heavy downtown traffic and multitude of one-way streets. Add to these

problems the lack of parking and heavy-handed meter maids, and leav-
ing your car outside the city limits makes sense. However, if you plan to
go over the Golden Gate or Bay bridges, or south to Monterey and Santa
Cruz, a car will be essential.
Dealing with rush hour
During the week, traffic backs up on bridge approaches throughout the
Financial District and downtown from 3 until about 7 p.m. North Beach
is usually busy from the late afternoon into the evening, and because the
streets bump into Columbus Avenue, navigating the area can be confus-
ing. On the weekends, Lombard Street and Van Ness Avenue take the
brunt of the cars inching toward the Golden Gate Bridge. Getting
through Chinatown’s narrow, crowded streets by car is basically impos-
sible during waking hours. If you must cross town, I suggest taking
California Street past the Financial District.
For sanity’s sake, avoid traveling outbound on the Golden Gate and Bay
bridges between 3 and 7 p.m. weekdays. If you plan to drive to Wine
Country (see Chapter 14), do not leave on a Friday after 2 p.m., if at all
possible. Traffic across the Golden Gate Bridge is awful on weekends,
especially if the weather is nice. Go before noon on Friday, and avoid
returning on Sunday afternoon.
Driving by the rules
California law requires that both drivers and passengers wear seat belts.
You may turn right at a red light (unless otherwise indicated) after yield-
ing to traffic and pedestrians and after making a complete stop. Cable
cars and streetcars always have the right of way, as do pedestrians,
especially if they use intersections and crosswalks. On Market Street,
one lane is exclusively for buses unless you’re making a right turn. Heed
the signs.
Being cautious with red lights
San Francisco drivers have a tendency to run red lights, so pause to
check oncoming traffic before entering an intersection just after the light
turns green.
Parking the car
I’m not going to take up space discussing the many parking laws. Just
take my advice: Park in a garage. They are expensive but could save you
some money, because parking tickets start at $40.
Legal street parking spaces are next to unpainted curbs. Yellow-, white-,
green-, and red-painted curbs are all off-limits in general — the only
exception being commercial zones (yellow curbs), which are okay to
park in after delivery hours. Pay attention to the signs posted on the
streets. Be aware of tow-away zones. You can’t park on most streets
downtown between 4 and 6 p.m. without running the risk of having your
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 81

car towed. If it is, you’ll find your rental at the AutoReturn Lot, 450
Seventh St., at Harrison Street (% 415-865-8200), faster than you can
say “Where’d I park the car?” If your wheels aren’t where you thought
you left them, call % 415-553-1239 to find out whether your vehicle has
been towed or merely stolen. If your car has been towed, you’ll need to
go to AutoReturn in person to pay the ticket and the storage charges
(which vary depending on how long the car has been there). This misad-
venture will cost you at least $185, cash or credit card only.
Legal parking spots are hard to come by. If you’re driving, park in a public
garage or use the services of a valet. And if you do happen to find a legal
space within walking distance of your destination, grab it.
Improving your parking karma
So, you want a parking space, huh? You’ll have to be one step ahead of
the crowd. Try these suggestions for a little edge:
 Carry quarters. Most parking meters accept nothing else; 25¢ buys
six minutes in most parts of town.
 Watch the clock. Many crosstown downtown streets do not allow
parking during rush hour, from 4 to 6 p.m. Get to the Financial
District, Union Square, SoMa, or Nob Hill a few minutes before 
6 p.m. to grab the great street parking space of your choice.
 Spring for valet parking. The extra money now may be worth
avoiding the headache of finding a parking spot later.
 Check out public parking garages. Public parking garages are
cheaper than private ones. In North Beach, park in the garage on
Vallejo Street (between Kearny and Green). In Chinatown, park at
the Portsmouth Square garage on Kearny Street.
 Make note of street-sweeping times. If you find street parking
galore in some outlying neighborhood, check signs for sweeping
hours and days. That’s generally the real reason for your good luck.
Don’t park without checking the signs, unless you want to give the
Department of Traffic a $35 donation. If your timing is right, how-
ever, you’ll pull up after the sweeper trucks have made their
rounds, when it’s perfectly okay to park.
 Stop “runaway” car syndrome. To keep your car from rolling away
while you’re parked on a hill, put the car in gear, apply the hand
brake, and curb your wheels — turn your wheels toward the curb
when facing downhill and away from the curb when facing uphill.
It’s the law! (This tip won’t contribute to your finding a parking
place, but it will help you keep the one you found.)

Checking In at San
Francisco’s Best Hotels
In This Chapter
 Choosing your chain or independent hotel
 Getting the best rates
 Using the Internet to uncover hotel deals
 Knowing the questions to ask to get the room you want
 Getting a room if you don’t have reservations
 Discovering the perfect San Francisco hotel
S
o, you’re ready to make San Francisco your home — for a short
time, at least. You probably have an idea of how much you’re willing
to spend (if not, check out Chapter 4), and you may have an idea of what
neighborhood suits your fancy (see Chapter 8 for descriptions). Other
features and amenities will be important to you, too. If you don’t stay in
hotels very often, you may not know what level of service or quality of
room you need to enjoy your stay. Consider, among other variables,
whether you really care if your room resembles something out of Condé
Nast Traveler, has an unobstructed view of the bay, is vulnerable to
street noise, or has a bathtub large enough for you and a close friend.
Will you feel despondent if the hotel can’t supply a cup of herbal tea at
10 p.m.? Will you behave badly all day if you can’t hit the treadmill first
thing in the morning? If you’re traveling with your laptop, is Wi-Fi a
necessity? If you’re traveling with your lap dog, is the hotel Fido
friendly? Avoid disappointment and surprises by discussing your
requirements with the reservations staff.
The hotel selections in this chapter are, in my opinion, among the best
in the city, balancing comfort, location, character, and price. With few
exceptions, each has a distinct, only-in-San-Francisco style I believe
you’ll find memorable and pleasing. For those traveling on frequent-flier
miles (which you can sometimes redeem for rooms), you won’t find
many of the big chain hotels listed here, but there are plenty: Turn to the
appendix for toll-free numbers and Web sites. I also leave out the major-
ity of hotels on less desirable blocks, many of the priciest palaces, as
well as those that are a bit too far from the action.

Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 85
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels

See the indexes at the end of this chapter for lists of recommended
hotels, organized by neighborhood and price.
No matter where you stay in San Francisco, you’re no more than 20 min-
utes by cab from the major sites, shopping areas, and restaurants. The
majority of the city’s hotels are in a few of the central neighborhoods.
With guidance from Chapter 8, pick the neighborhood you want to stay
in based on your interests and needs — for example, are you hoping to
shop the major stores? Are you an enthusiastic museum-goer? Do you
hope to find peace and quiet? Or do you want to be close to the bay?
Refer to Frommer’s San Francisco (Wiley Publishing) for accommoda-
tions in neighborhoods outside the central part of the city that aren’t
covered here, or go to Citysearch (www.sanfrancisco.citysearch.
com), where you can search for hotels by area and price.
Getting to Know Your Options
Hotels come in many shapes, sizes, and price ranges. You’ll find chain
hotels and motels, independent hotels, and hotels that serve business
travelers rather than vacationers. So what are the differences between
these various accommodations?
Choosing between chain hotels 
and independent hotels
Hotels affiliated with huge chains, such as Holiday Inn, Hilton, Sheraton,
Marriott, and Hyatt, are often monolithic or merely architecturally homely
structures that are a bit on the boring side and look pretty much the same
wherever you travel. Even the rooms will have similar, if not identical,
décor. But there’s comfort in that, and for travelers who like the assurance
of a brand name, chains are a fine choice. In San Francisco, businesspeo-
ple and conventioneers often make up the clientele at these hotels. The
appendix at the back of this book lists toll-free telephone numbers for the
major chains.
Independent hotels (sometimes also called boutique hotels) are smaller
in scope than the big-name properties. They target travelers who want 
a unique, individualized atmosphere with a local slant. Some appeal to
older couples seeking quiet and cozy budget lodgings, while other inde-
pendents seek to attract the sophisticated traveler with hip furnishings
and wild color schemes. San Francisco is a leader in the boutique hotel
scene, with a great assortment. If you want more interesting surround-
ings, where your fellow guests may be movie fans, literati, musicians, or
shopaholics, you may enjoy a stay in a boutique hotel.
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
86

Make sure you know what you’re getting into, though — boutique hotels
are not for everyone. Lower-end independent hotels may not meet a
business traveler’s needs, and staff members are not always immedi-
ately available to answer questions or provide services. Room service is
also iffy unless a restaurant is connected to the property. However, San
Francisco’s boutique properties tend to provide good to amazing service
and amenities.
Do I really get breakfast in bed? Unpacking in a B&B
B&Bs, or bed-and-breakfast inns, can come in the form of an extra bed-
room or two in a private home or a house renovated for the purpose of
providing accommodations to visitors. Some B&Bs are lavishly deco-
rated, with an owner who prides himself on serving gourmet breakfasts
and afternoon sherry. Other owners put less effort into the business,
keeping some food in the fridge and engaging in casual conversation
with guests about the local sites, rather than providing any official tour
guidance. Accommodations at a B&B usually come with a continental or
full breakfast. You may have to share the bathroom with fellow guests.
Rooms at B&Bs are usually more economical than hotel accommoda-
tions, but a few luxury B&Bs have equally high-end prices.
Some small hotels advertise as B&Bs. In general, these properties have a
dozen or so guest rooms, include continental breakfast (usually coffee
and pastries) in the room rate, and often offer wine in the afternoon.
I recommend a few stellar B&Bs in this book, but plenty more are in the
city. For more information on bed-and-breakfasts and lists of properties,
the following resources can help:
 Bed & Breakfast San Francisco (% 415-899-0060; www.bbsf.com).
This organization has information on small B&Bs.
 California Association of Bed and Breakfast Inns, 414 Twenty-
Ninth Street, Sacramento, CA 95816 (% 800-373-9251; www.cabbi.
com). The Web site has links to member inns.
 Bed and Breakfast Inns of Napa Valley (% 707-944-4444; www.
napavalley.com/lodging). This organization is a great resource 
if you plan to take a side trip to Wine Country.
Family ties: Choosing a kid-friendly hotel
The younger generation loves San Francisco for its beauty, wealth of
activities, great food, and those cable cars. Hotels are waking up to the
fact that families appreciate attention paid to children, but by and large,
that means different things to different marketing departments. The Ritz-
Carlton, for example, will send a bellhop to baby-proof your quarters
and provide the nanny with some aspirin, while the desk clerk at the
Hotel Del Sol will dig out a beach ball for the kids. Few hotels have swim-
ming pools, by the way. (For more on accommodations for families, take
a look at Frommer’s San Francisco with Kids, published by Wiley
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 87

Publishing.) If you’re taking your darlings along on this trip, you have
three choices for sleeping arrangements: Share a room with them, rent
two rooms, or reserve a suite.
Sharing a room with your family means reserving a double/double,
queen/queen, or king/king — one room with two double, queen, or king
beds. Double/doubles are the least expensive option and work best for a
family of four with kids too young to have a room of their own. If you
come to terms with the fact that you won’t be staying up late, you won’t
be sleeping in, and this trip will revolve around the kids’ needs, you can
have a calm holiday.
Renting two rooms connected by an interior door or across the hall from
each other is a great option if you have a large family or are traveling
with older, more independent kids. Although you end up spending twice
the money, renting two rooms ensures that you can get some R&R, if
only for a few blissful hours.
Reserving a suite may seem like an extravagant way to give yourself a
little space while keeping a close eye on the children, but it’s really a
clever way to enjoy a high-quality hotel experience. Look at it this way:
$300 buys you two rooms at the Golden Gate Hotel near Union Square, but
at the Grosvenor, $269 sets the nuclear family up in a two-bedroom suite
complete with a compact kitchenette and continental breakfast in the
tony environs of Nob Hill. King suites at the Tuscan Inn near Fisherman’s
Wharf won’t be more than $369, and the hotel offers all sorts of dis-
counted rates.
Unlike in resort destinations, few hotels in San Francisco offer special
kids’ programs or amenities. The hotels that I designate as Kid Friendly
are the ones that suit families because of room size, location, or their
willingness, in my opinion, to accommodate a family’s needs and make
them feel welcome.
Finding the Best Room Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be
pleasantly surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
88

often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel.)
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special group rate
for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell the central
booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy
rates rise and fall. (See Chapter 3 for advice on the best months to get
deals on hotels.) Even within a given season, room prices are subject to
change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be different
from the rate you receive when you make your reservation. Be sure to
mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs, and any
other corporate rewards programs you can think of — or your Uncle
Joe’s Elks lodge in which you’re an honorary inductee, for that matter —
when you call to book. You never know when the affiliation may be
worth a few dollars off your room rate.
The rack rates I give in the hotel listings do not include the 14 percent
hotel tax. And those outrageous valet garage prices — also taxed at 14
percent — are per day. You will pay extra to park an oversized vehicle.
Many of these hotels offer weekend discounts and parking or breakfast
packages. Before you book, always ask if any specials, packages, or pro-
motions are going on that may get you a better deal.
If you’re driving, don’t feel obliged to use the hotel’s valet to park. The
cost just keeps increasing. If you’re planning to keep the car garaged,
drop your luggage at the hotel and head to the nearest public parking
structure. Around Union Square, you’ll find the Ellis-O’Farrell Garage,
123 O’Farrell St. ($34/day; % 415-986-4800; www.eofgarage.com); the
Sutter-Stockton Garage, 444 Stockton St. ($34/day; % 415-982-7275);
and the Union Square Garage, 333 Post St. ($31/day; % 415-397-0631).
SoMa has the city’s largest facility, the Fifth and Mission Garage, 833
Mission St. ($30/day; % 415-982-8522; www.fifthandmission.com). Of
course, you don’t get in-and-out privileges, nor will anyone fetch the car
for you, but one of the biggest complaints hotel guests have is how slow
the valets are to bring the cars around. Save yourself time and money
and self-park.
Getting the Best Room at the Best Rate
Obviously, you can get all the service and style you want if price is no
object. But when it is, as is so often the case, here’s a little advice for
chatting up the reservations-desk staff: Charm is useful; being com-
pletely clear about your expectations is just as important.
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 89

Finding the best rate
Make sure you cover all the bases when researching hotels. Besides
checking with the hotel’s reservations staff and toll-free number (see
“Finding the Best Room Rate,” above), surf the Web. Most hotels are
likely to meet any price you can get on an Internet hotel reservation
service. That way they still get your business without paying a commis-
sion to the service.
If you reserve over the Internet, print out your booking transaction
(including your confirmation number) and bring it with you. Hotels have
been known to make mistakes on the final bill, such as charging for park-
ing or breakfast when a package or promotion included it, and proof in
hand will smooth negotiations.
When budgeting for hotel rates, watch out for hidden fees and extra costs.
Knowing things up front is better than getting stuck later. Traveling with
man’s best friend? Be sure to ask if there’s a cleaning charge for pets on
top of the room rate.
Consider joining the hotel’s loyalty program prior to making your reser-
vation. Sure, it’s a marketing tool, but in exchange for your e-mail address
and some benign personal information, you may receive upgrades and
slightly more attentive service, especially if you become a return cus-
tomer. In San Francisco, Joie de Vivre, Personality Hotels, and Kimpton all
offer perks for membership.
Figuring in taxes and extra expenses
A hotel room that costs $99 a night actually will end up closer to $114
because of the hotel tax. It’s steep, and it’s unavoidable. Room-service
charges can also inflate your final room tab. Local phone calls, treats that
cram the minibar in your room, enticing baskets of goodies on an end
table — none of these are gratis (unless they’re marked “complimentary”).
If you like to snack in bed, buy your favorite goodies at a nearby market
or convenience store, and bring them up to your room.
Don’t forget that most hotels tack on a fee for merely dialing out on the
phone in your room. The charge starts at 75¢ and increases depending
on what the market will bear. This is, of course, in addition to long-
distance charges. Triple-check that you have your cellphone and
charger. For dinner reservations or event tickets, let your hotel
concierge do the talking.
Bargain hunting in season
Officially, the low season in San Francisco is from November to March,
but one highly experienced downtown concierge joked that the low
season was the weekends (when business travelers leave town).
Although more tourists do visit between spring and early fall, your
actual concerns should center on convention and business travelers.
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
90

The San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau (see the appendix)
keeps a calendar of major conventions, and I recommend checking it
before you finalize your plans. Union Square and SoMa hotels and
restaurants are always packed when Moscone Center is booked.
Generally, you’ll get your best rate in the winter, on weekends when the
suits go home, and around holidays when you’re supposed to be at
Cousin Seymour’s and not gallivanting around San Francisco. Don’t let
that discourage you from arriving whenever it’s convenient for you, of
course. Just make your reservations far in advance.
As room rates fluctuate with the season (and the economy), occupancy
rates also rise and fall. A hotel is less likely to extend discount rates if 
it is close to full, but most (the Ritz-Carlton being an exception) will
negotiate if they’re close to empty. Tourist-oriented hotels usually offer
discounted rates for midweek stays because they’re typically most
crowded on weekends. The reverse is true for business hotels down-
town. Wine Country hotels tend to charge the most in the fall, around
harvest time, and on weekends during the summer. Rates listed in this
book are probably different from the rate you’ll be quoted when you
make your reservation, because room prices are subject to change with-
out notice. In addition, discounts for membership in AAA, AARP, fre-
quent-flier programs, and other programs can change room rates
significantly, regardless of the season. The word on the street is that
hotel room prices are on the increase, as are occupancy rates.
Surfing the Web for Hotel Deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). These Internet hotel agen-
cies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing for the
business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations around 
the world. This competition can be a boon to consumers who have the
patience and time to shop and compare the online sites for good deals —
but shop they must, for prices can vary considerably from site to site. And
keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing may be there for no
other reason than that they paid money for the placement.
In addition to the online travel booking sites Travelocity, Expedia, Orbitz,
Priceline, and Hotwire, you can book hotels through Hotels.com,
Quikbook (www.quikbook.com), and Travelaxe (www.travelaxe.net).
HotelChatter.com is a daily webzine offering smart coverage and 
critiques of hotels worldwide. Go to TripAdvisor.com or HotelShark.
com for helpful independent consumer reviews of hotels and resort
properties.
It’s a good idea to get a confirmation number and make a printout of
any online booking transaction.
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 91

Don’t assume that the hotels offered on the sites are all in handy, safe
neighborhoods or offer the amenities you want. These sites merely list
the properties; they don’t judge them.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline (www.priceline.com) and
Hotwire (www.hotwire.com) are even better for hotels than for airfares;
with both, you’re allowed to pick the neighborhood and quality level of
your hotel before offering up your money. On the downside, many hotels
stick Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the
BiddingForTravel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bid-
ding on a hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of
hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire,
you pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels don’t
provide loyalty-program credits or other frequent-guest amenities when
you book a room through opaque online services.
The Web can be a good resource for hotel deals, but in my humble opin-
ion, you usually get the most accurate information by calling the hotel
directly. No matter what assurances you receive from online agencies,
travel agency Web sites cannot guarantee specific rooms (unless, per-
haps, you requested the bridal or presidential suite), and they know
very little about the hotel they’re selling. In many cases, the “reviews”
you read online are provided and paid for by the hotels and, therefore,
are likely to be promotional rather than critical.
Another problem recently brought to my attention is the difficulty in 
getting a refund from some of these reservation services if you have to
cancel your stay. The service, not the hotel, has your money until it set-
tles with the hotel after you’ve checked out. Finally, there may be a dif-
ference between the amount of dough you pay the agency for your room
and the amount the agency pays the hotel (that’s the profit motive for
you). If you don’t like the place, again, you’re stuck negotiating for a
refund from the online agency rather than the hotel itself.
Reserving the best room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two pointed questions
can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and
have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t
always cost more. Also ask if the hotel is renovating; if it is, request a
room away from the renovation work. Inquire, too, about the location 
of restaurants, bars, and discos in the hotel — all sources of annoying
noise. And if you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to
the staff members at the front desk. If they have another room, they
should be happy to accommodate you, within reason.
You can smoke outside in San Francisco to your heart’s content, but be
aware that the city has stringent antismoking laws inside public build-
ings, restaurants, and even bars. A sizable number of hotels, especially
the smaller ones, are smoke-free. Other hotels have smoking rooms only
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
92

on designated floors. Common courtesy in San Francisco is to ask before
lighting up; you’d be surprised at the number of people who are allergic
to smoke. If a smoking (or nonsmoking) room is important to you, let the
reservations desk know when you call.
Arriving Without Reservations
I am amazed at how many people come to San Francisco without hotel
reservations, believing that a fabulous $30-a-night room is awaiting them
in a fancy hotel. They usually end up sleeping in a “No-Tell Motel” in a
dicey neighborhood because that’s all that was available. Or they spend
the better part of a day looking for accommodations, wasting valuable
vacation time searching for a bargain or, finally, just a room, when there
are none to be had. Don’t be one of those people. Reserve your vacation
lodgings ahead of time.
However, if you’re reading this book in the airport while waiting to board
your flight to our fair city, you can try the following suggestions if you
don’t have a place to stay already:
 Call a free reservation service such as San Francisco Reservations
(% 800-677-1570 or 510-628-4450; www.hotelres.com) or California
Reservations (% 415-252-1107).
 Make your way to a boutique hotel and hope the desk clerk takes
pity on you. Most of the boutique properties in town are part of
small, independent companies, and a good-hearted staff person
may be willing to make some calls to sister hotels to help you
secure a room.
 Find a friendly concierge you can leave your luggage with so you
can look for a room in the neighborhood unencumbered. If the
town appears to be booked solid (ask the desk clerk’s opinion),
don’t be picky or cheap. You can always move the next day if some-
thing better opens up.
Getting the Most for Your Money
Every accommodation that I recommend in this book is marked with one
to four dollar signs. Here’s a quick breakdown of the price categories,
and what amenities and services you should expect in each range. All
rates are for a standard double-occupancy room, excluding taxes.
 $ ($125 or less): Accommodations in this category are often in
older buildings that may show their age. Room service, laundry or
dry cleaning, valet parking, and porters do not come with the pack-
age, but the rooms are carefully tended, and the properties them-
selves exhibit some charm. The least expensive rooms may not
have their own bathrooms.
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 93

The rooms I recommend in this price category tend to be on the
“cozy” side and are typically furnished with inexpensive bed-
spreads, towels, and curtains. You won’t find irons, swank toiletries
in the bathrooms, or robes in the closet. Air-conditioning is also
considered a luxury, although you rarely need it in San Francisco. A
concierge won’t be at the ready to cater to your every whim, but
most desk clerks are delighted to help you arrange tours, tickets
for shows, and dinner reservations. Many of the budget hotels rec-
ommended here include continental breakfast in the room rate,
making them especially good deals.
 $$ ($126–$225): In this price category, I recommend some wonderful,
charming places with stylish (but still small) rooms, handsome lob-
bies, and good to great service. Antique armoires and marble-tiled
bathrooms are standard issue in a few picks, but in general, these
properties are for leisure travelers with minimal demands beyond
comfort and appealing décor. A separate concierge desk is not
always available, but the front desk staff is usually willing to make
reservations and book tours. Parking is sometimes valet, but more
often it’s self-parking at lots up to 3 blocks away. Room service is usu-
ally nonexistent, although you will probably find a cafe or restaurant
attached to the property. Make sure to inquire about extras such as
bathrobes and Wi-Fi if those things are important to you. Often the
more expensive suites are well equipped, but the low-end rooms
won’t have that all-important hair dryer unless you ask for it.
 $$$ ($226–$350): At this price, expect attentive service — usually
including valet parking and porters — and larger rooms with finer
fabrics and décor, including the de rigueur iPod docks and flat-panel
TVs. Many properties in this range also have on-site StairMasters,
and at least one has a pool. Although at the low end of this scale
you may not find hand-milled soaps in the bathroom, at the high
end, you’ll feel pretty pampered.
When you’re willing to pay this kind of money for a hotel, you prob-
ably have certain expectations. Make them known when you make
your reservation. Don’t wait until check-in to ask if you can receive
faxes or if valet parking actually means a bellhop is going to fetch
your car for you at 6 a.m.
 $$$$ ($351 or more): Your big bucks buy views, personal service, 
a chauffeured car to the Financial District, and high-thread-count
linens. Be prepared for the well-trained staff to kowtow to you.
Large rooms usually feature fancy products and thick terry robes in
the mirrored bathroom, an iron in the closet, art on the walls, and,
in some cases, umbrellas and flowers. Honor bars and baskets of
overpriced goodies are also standard. For this much money, it
would be a shame if you didn’t spend some quality time in the
hotel, fingering the drapes and calling down to the concierge desk
for a weather report. Again, room rates are tied to location, with
Nob Hill and Embarcadero properties charging whatever the
market will bear.

The Andrews Hotel
$–$$
Union Square
The services and location make this 48-room 1905 Victorian hotel a deal for
singles or couples on a budget, although the rooms and bathrooms are
pretty small, even by local standards. You do get a continental breakfast
buffet provided on each floor, evening wine gratis at Café Fino, next door,
and attractive, homey, wood-trimmed décor. Amiable receptionists serve
double duty as concierge staff. You won’t have air-conditioning or a tub in
which to soak (most rooms have showers only), but you can open the win-
dows. Amenities include fresh flowers and in-room VCRs; complimentary
videos are available from the reception desk. Seriously consider spending
the extra $20 per night on a sunny Bay King room like no. 403. Avoid the
dark, tiny rooms ending in 08. If street noise keeps you awake, request a
room in the rear of the building.

Argonaut Hotel
$$$––$$$$
North Beach/Fisherman’s Wharf
In an enviable position on the western side of the Cannery, this perky bou-
tique hotel makes the innumerable chains around Fisherman’s Wharf
blush in comparison. Many of the heavily nautical-themed rooms have a
view of either Alcatraz or the Golden Gate Bridge, while the less expensive
interior rooms are touted as being quieter. Designers kept the 1907 brick
walls and wooden beams in place, where possible, adding plantation shut-
ters and using a palette of primary colors, which makes the place fun and
attractive to families and visitors who want quality lodgings in this admit-
tedly touristy area. Guest rooms are fairly spacious, but I was surprised at
the ordinary-looking bathrooms with shallow tubs. Amenities are gener-
ous, including Aveda products, flat-panel TVs, DVD players, robes, well-
stocked minibars, and coffeemakers. The hotel’s restaurant, Blue
Mermaid, serves all day and is better than average for wharf food.

Russian Hill
The Castle Inn is a good choice, away from Union Square and the worst
traffic on Van Ness Avenue. Units at this convenient, friendly motel have
maple furniture, in-room VCRs, microwave ovens, and small refrigerators.
Rates include continental breakfast and Wi-Fi. Guests are within walking

distance of Polk Street’s bars and restaurants and Fisherman’s Wharf. If
you have a car to park and want to avoid the exorbitant garage fees in
Union Square and around Fisherman’s Wharf, the Castle Inn is a smart pick;
but it’s not so great if you want to be closer to shops and theater.

Chancellor Hotel
$$–$$$
Union Square
The 137-room Chancellor has been owned and managed by the same
family since 1917 and offers a level of intimacy and value you just won’t
find in many other comparable inns. It’s right on the Powell Street cable-
car line, a handbag’s throw from Saks Fifth Avenue. The little bathrooms
are well stocked; the petite guest rooms are brightly decorated and com-
fortably furnished; and you get a choice of pillows. For views, request front
rooms ending in 00 to 05, but aim for the higher floors — the garbage
trucks start their rounds at 5 a.m., and you don’t want to be near the street.
Amenities include ceiling fans (instead of air-conditioning), and coffee and
cookies at the front desk. The hotel restaurant serves breakfast and lunch
and provides room service. Smoking is prohibited.

Cow Hollow Motor Inn & Suites
$–$$$
The Marina/Cow Hollow
These serviceable, nonsmoking motel rooms, unfortunately reached by
elevators inside the parking garage, are clean and quiet, thanks to a dili-
gent staff and double-paned windows, respectively. The early Sears
Roebuck furnishings may not yet have made a style comeback, but you’ll
appreciate the in-room coffeemakers, hair dryers, and relatively spacious
bathrooms. What makes the Cow Hollow Motor Inn of particular interest,
besides free parking, free Wi-Fi, and low rates, is that it’s around the corner
from the best blocks of Chestnut Street, where the shopping and dining
set a high standard. Families can settle into one of six suites with kitchens
and a separate entrance right on Chestnut Street. Try to avoid rooms
ending in 28, which are next to noisy ice machines.

into the pillared, golden-colored lobby, which is usually humming with busi-
nesspeople and older leisure travelers. Depending on the time of year, you
can get relatively decent rates (around $250), albeit in one of the “cozy”
queens in the main building. These are the same size as similar rooms in the
Tower building but don’t have views and are priced accordingly. Tower
rooms also have gorgeous marble tubs with separate showers; all guest
rooms are filled with amenities. Make sure to have a drink in the kitschy
Tonga Room and marvel at the regularly scheduled storms. If you have kids
along, take advantage of the 5 to 7 p.m. happy hour, featuring a $9.50 all-
you-can-eat Asian-inspired buffet — lots of young locals do. Should you be
interested in a real San Francisco treat, you’ll find it at the Fairmont, but if
it’s five-star treatment you’re after, head for the Ritz or the St. Regis.

Golden Gate Hotel

Union Square
If you’re flexible (or broke) enough to share a bathroom, this cheerful,
charming, 23-room Edwardian hotel with the feel of a B&B is a fabulous
deal, in a great location for cable-car lovers and walkers. Traveling with
older children? Take two of the small, pretty rooms, and buy yourself some
privacy. Rates include continental breakfast and afternoon tea, which adds
to the feeling that the Golden Gate is run for love rather than money. The
property has a cat and a dog, so if you’re allergic, this unfortunately isn’t
the spot for you. The hotel has no air-conditioning.

Nob Hill
Visitors who require the conveniences of home — laundry facilities, ample
closets, and the ability to reheat leftovers — will be very pleased with
these roomy nonsmoking studio and one-bedroom suites. The furnishings
are, shall we say, a bit tired, but given the location, the tidy kitchenettes
(in every room), the complimentary continental breakfast, and the views
(sixth floor and up), it’s a great value. The sole two-bedroom suite, com-
plete with two bathrooms, is an especially terrific deal for families. An
online cash rebate from the hotel’s Web site reduces the tariff to bargain
rates. Amenities are spare; bring your own iPod dock if necessary.

Union Square
This favorite with tour packagers happens to be one of the better family
hotels near Union Square: It features a small, heated outdoor pool — a
rarity in San Francisco — as well as Nintendo, if you consider that a posi-
tive. (And kids under 15 stay free!) The regular doubles with smallish bath-
rooms have been renovated, as has the lobby, but splash out on one of the
larger Club Rooms in an adjacent building. They feature a dressing area,
cozy robes, the morning paper, and extra space. The hotel’s two-bedroom
suites are also a good value, and refrigerators are provided on request.
Rooms by the pool are quietest.

Harbor Court Hotel

The Embarcadero
Located just steps from the bay, this Kimpton hotel is an especially roman-
tic and sophisticated property, lower key than the Hotel Vitale but equally
stylish. Rooms were remodeled in 2005, and although they are pretty small,
they’re so warmly decorated and comfy I can imagine moving in for a long
weekend, stirring only to watch the yoga channel on the flat-screen TV.
Reserve or upgrade to a queen or king bay room, which features dramatic
views of the water and Bay Bridge. Guests have free access to the state-of-
the-art Embarcadero YMCA pool and health club right next door. A com-
plimentary wine reception takes place each evening, and afterward you
can step into trendy Ozumo, which is accessible from the lobby.

Hayes Valley Inn
$
Civic Center/Hayes Valley
In the not-so-distant past, I’d never have recommended spending the night
in this neighborhood, but the upscale shopping and dining opportunities
have developed to such an extent that they override any other concerns
(such as panhandlers). Hotel choices are limited, but for budget travelers —
or anyone who prefers to spend his or her dough on good meals or local
designers — this 28-room Edwardian B&B is a find. Yes, you’ll have to share
the very clean toilets and showers, but you can brush your teeth at the
sink/vanity in your sweetly decorated room. Expect to meet European
tourists over cereal, bagels, orange juice, and coffee (included in the rates).
Street-side rooms are larger but noisier. The Van Ness Muni station and F-
Market streetcars are a few minutes’ walk east. The Asian Art Museum,
opera, ballet, and symphony are a few minutes north.

Given that I’m no booster of huge corporate hotels, you might wonder
what a Hilton is doing in this chapter. Well, $45 million worth of remodel-
ing plus brilliant views plus a solid gold location where Chinatown meets
the Financial District meets North Beach turned my head. Ignore the
façade and call in your frequent-guest chits for a bay view room (12th floor
and higher). Yes, the décor is uninspiring and the bathrooms very small,
but the beds are comfy, and wireless Internet access is free, unlike at
Starwood’s properties. The Tru Spa off the lobby is another selling point,
as is easy parking. But dock your auto yourself in the Portsmouth Square
Garage, across the street. You’ll save enough on valet fees to pay for a mas-
sage. Look for deals here on Priceline.

Hotel Adagio
$$–$$$
Union Square
In a previous incarnation, this 1929 Colonial Revival building housed the
tired Shannon Court Hotel, but a total face-lift in 2003 turned Joan
Crawford into Cindy Crawford. The Adagio’s modern guest rooms and
clean, masculine lines won’t appeal to frill-seekers, but the hotel is closer
in spirit to the W and the Clift (which is just down the block) — albeit more
competitively priced. Sleek young things already jostle for space in the bar
and a table in the mucho caldo Cortez restaurant (see Chapter 10). Because
this is an older building, air-conditioning consists of ceiling fans and win-
dows that open. A nicely fitted fitness center, complimentary high-speed
and wireless Internet access, high-end bath products, complimentary
coffee and tea, and executive-level guest rooms that come with views and
continental breakfast bring the hotel squarely into the here and now.

Hotel Bohème

North Beach/Fisherman’s Wharf
Set in the heart of North Beach, this charming, intimate hotel echoes the
area’s old bohemian feel. Fifteen small but romantic, beautiful rooms are
vividly painted and have iron beds and generous in-room amenities,
including free wireless. Teensy bathrooms have showers only, no tubs. The
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 101

accommodating staff is happy to assist with tours, rental cars, and restau-
rant reservations; you’ll have to schlep your own luggage up the narrow
stairs, though. The hotel has no air-conditioning, but the windows open.
You’re likely to find a younger, less conservative crowd staying here than
at the Washington Square Inn, another small hotel in this neighborhood
and price range.

Hotel Del Sol
$$–$$$
The Marina/Cow Hollow
Paint, mosaic tiles, and imagination can do a lot to reinvent a motel, and
there’s no better example than the Del Sol. You’ll think you’re in Southern
California (after the fog lifts), except that you can walk around this neigh-
borhood without getting startled looks from drivers. The heated pool and
a hammock suspended between palm trees complete the hallucination.
Multicolored, fun, reasonably sized guest rooms and suites could have
stepped out of a ’90s Habitat catalog, and one is configured especially for
families, with games and bunk beds. The best parts: Parking is free, and
you’re not on busy Lombard Street.

Hotel Frank
$$–$$$$
Union Square
Formerly the Maxwell, this 100-year-old hotel was under renovation at press
time, and new owner Personality Hotels was relaunching it as Hotel Frank.
The guest rooms, which are either spacious and light or small and dark,
depending on your pocketbook or the kindness of the desk clerk, no longer
show signs of the old Art Deco décor. All feature flat-panel TVs suspended
on brass poles, bold black-and-white carpeting, and a hanging light fixture
that reminds me of a family of pygmy spaceships hovering above the land-
ing site. I quite like it. The location, which isn’t subject to updating, remains
prime for shopping and nightlife. Max’s on the Square provides room serv-
ice. Be sure to check prices on the junior suites, especially off season.

Hotel Griffon
$$$–$$$$
The Embarcadero
Once the homely sister among the boutique hotels in this area, the Griffon
jazzed up its rooms in 2007, with tangerine-colored paint, new furniture,

pillow-top mattresses, flat-panel TVs, and iPod docks. The original brick
remains, as well as sink/vanity combos in some of the small guest rooms,
but that’s part of this hotel’s boho charm. For those who require natural
light, six end rooms plus two suites offer unsurpassed bay views; three
city-side suites have decks. It’s now a toss-up between the Griffon and the
neighboring Harbor Court, but both have more personality than the
Embarcadero Hyatt, and I like the location — very close to the water. A
well-equipped YMCA (free for guests) is next door, and a good restaurant
is off the lobby. Rates include continental breakfast and Wi-Fi. This is a
nonsmoking hotel.

Hotel Kabuki
$$–$$$
Japantown
The beautifully calm Hotel Kabuki, redesigned and rechristened in 2007,
has helped raise this little neighborhood outside the tourist fray to true
destination status. An easy 10-minute bus ride from Union Square, the
hotel is steps away from Fillmore Street’s excellent boutiques, restaurants,
and music clubs. If you love to take baths, this is the place for you: It fea-
tures Japanese soaking tubs in many of the Eastern-themed rooms. And, if
you take umbrage with panhandlers, most are down around Union Square.
Corner rooms are nicest; suites are truly spacious. This is a nonsmoking
property, and as at all Joie de Vivre hotels, Wi-Fi is free.

Hotel Milano
$–$$$
SoMa
This well-designed and -maintained Italian-themed boutique hotel isn’t
flashy or hip, but if you can get a rate under $150, you won’t find a better
value in SoMa. Amenities include a spacious on-site fitness room, a bar,
and more floor space in your room than you’ll find in other hotels in this
price range. The multistory San Francisco Shopping Centre and new
Westfield Centre are a few feet away, and Yerba Buena Gardens is just
around the corner, covering your retail, restaurant, and cultural needs.
Personally, I prefer the intimacy of this hotel to the atmosphere at the
much larger Westin Market Street (2 blocks away), but if you’re looking for
a SoMa room with a view or a hotel with more services, the Westin is a
better bet.

Hotel Monaco

Union Square
You’ll wish you’d brought your foxtail-trimmed scarf and vintage Vuitton
steamer trunk when you sashay into the Art Deco–inspired Monaco. The
medium-size rooms are lushly decorated with patterned wallpaper, floral
prints, and canopied beds. All the amenities — like room service and a spa
and fitness center — are available, plus it’s a pet-friendly hotel. The aptly
named Grand Cafe restaurant is next door. If you’re feeling lonely, the
hotel will deliver a bowl of goldfish to your room. If you’re carting along
the children, tell the desk staff — they provide milk and cookies for
munchkins.

Hotel Palomar
$$$–$$$$
SoMa
This extremely grown-up hotel sits above a busy corner close to Union
Square and the attractions south of Market. The hotel was designed for
sophisticated business and leisure travelers; you can expect a high-qual-
ity experience (at high-quality prices) in luxuriously sedate surroundings.
The ample guest rooms are fitted for work and play, with multiline phones,
fax machines, DVD players, free Wi-Fi, spa tubs, and L’Occitane products.
There’s room service, a tiny fitness center, and the Fifth Floor, one of the
more glamorous restaurants in town. Hotel Palomar compares in price to
its neighbor, the W. So what’s the difference? The Palomar is what the W
will be when it’s all grown up. But the W is convinced it’s having more fun.

Dorothy Parker fans will appreciate this 94-room delight, which, despite

mentary wine. The rooms are all smartly designed and decorated; they
vary in size from smallish doubles to more ample executive kings.
Amenities include CD players, free Wi-Fi, and Café Andrée, which serves
room service, three squares, and Sunday brunch. The hotel hosts live jazz
music on Friday night.

Union Square
The music of the Grateful Dead and/or their close personal friends blares
from lobby speakers in this hip ’n happening ode to rock ’n’ roll. Doubles
are bite-size, but oh, baby, are they funky. This wacky (and smoke-free)
place is heavy on playful style but also provides plenty of amenities,
including Nintendo, gratis Wi-Fi, and happy hour with free wine and beer.
To pay homage to the gods of abs, there’s a small on-site fitness room. The
fabulous location, across from Chinatown’s Dragon Gate, makes standing
outside on the sidewalk an exotic experience. Rooms ending in 07 are espe-
cially compact, so you probably want to avoid them.

Hotel Vitale

The Embarcadero
If you consider yourself urbane yet earthy, practical yet appreciative of
the better things in life, the Hotel Vitale has a room with your name on it.
Expensive but not over-the-top extravagant, this contemporary property
occupies the most coveted patch of earth in town — right across the
boulevard from the Ferry Building. Spoiled by delicious views, guests can
catch an F-Market streetcar right behind the building, which lies within
walking distance of well-regarded restaurants and BART. Inside, it is a
delight as well. You’ll notice first how good the place smells (small vials
with dried lavender grace the hallways), and attention to detail continues
inside the guest rooms. Deluxe waterfront sanctuaries feature sexy walk-
in showers rather than the skimpy tub/shower combos in the viewless (yet
spacious) interior rooms. A spa with two outdoor soaking tubs and a daily
yoga class provide centering.

The Huntington Hotel

Nob Hill
The Boston Brahmin in you will adore this refined, quiet, nonsmoking
oasis, with its subtle elegance, impeccable service, and a gorgeous spa.
The 1924 building originally housed apartments, so guest rooms and bath-
rooms are larger than average; most are labeled suites. Rooms above the
eighth floor have views; the ones below are extra spacious and have iPod
docks and wireless Internet. Children are welcome in the hotel (but not in
the pool or spa), and manicured Huntington Park, complete with a play-
ground, is across the street. The staff, concierge included, will anticipate
your every need. If you can afford to lay down the cash for a room here,
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 105

you could also choose to stay at the Fairmont or Ritz-Carlton, the
Huntington’s Nob Hill neighbors, but I love the old-fashioned San
Franciscan feel of the Huntington. If you want the total San Francisco expe-
rience, this is it. You’ll certainly be pampered here, but if you’re looking
for something more glamorous and less old world, go with the Ritz.

Hyatt Regency San Francisco
$$–$$$$
The Embarcadero
This enormous (you’re likely to get lost looking for your room) corporate
hotel at the foot of Market Street gets the thumbs up for its location close
to the Ferry Building and the Embarcadero Center shops. For the money,
however, I’d stay at the Harbor Court or Vitale. Rooms are well equipped
and spacious, and some have beautiful views. The atrium lobby holds a
restaurant, bar, and a few shops, and the hotel has a fitness center. This is
probably your best bet for a hotel in the Embarcadero area if you’re trav-
eling with kids, who will love the glass elevators. Around the winter holi-
days, an outdoor ice skating rink is minutes from the lobby. If you won’t
need the car, self-park it in an Embarcadero Center lot for $30 per day.

Inn at Union Square

Union Square
This small, very discreet hotel is just the ticket if you desire a bit of luxury
but don’t care to make a scene. You get those little extras — continental
breakfast, newspapers, bathrobes, wine and cheese in the early evening,
nice linens, 24-hour concierge, health-club access, complimentary Wi-Fi —
combined with very reasonable rates that make it a pleasure to part with
some, but not too much, of your money. Tasteful rooms range from small
queens to two-room suites, and all have benefited from a recent tidying with
new furniture, fabrics, and wallpaper. The hotel has no air-conditioning and
bans smoking.

are already among the handsomest in the neighborhood. Request a Royal

kitchens. A granddaughter of the original owner redecorated the medium-
sized studios with Italian bathroom tiles, Mission-style furniture, and
pretty quilts, making this one of the few places on Lombard Street with
even a hint of charm. Families can reserve two connecting rooms with a
shared bathroom. Surprisingly, considering the location, rooms off the
street are remarkably quiet. The front desk clerk will arrange tours or
rental cars at your request. It is the definition of cheap and cheerful.

The Orchard Garden Hotel
$$–$$$
Union Square
California’s first sustainable, energy-efficient hotel, designed and built to
receive U.S. Green Building Council LEED certification, makes it easier
being green. Some initiatives — such as in-room recycling and key cards
that switch on the room lights — are more apparent than others (chemi-
cal-free cleaning products). The small, Wi-Fi-enabled, well-appointed
rooms have larger-than-average bathrooms stocked with upscale organic
Aveda products. Like its sister property, the Orchard Hotel, the nonsmok-
ing Orchard Garden Hotel feels calm and low-key. It doesn’t have much of
a lobby, but there are a small bar and a restaurant with good food. If you
want a livelier, more youthful atmosphere, the Hotel Triton (also near
Chinatown’s Dragon Gate) may suit you better; if you want an oasis after
a hard day of sightseeing or even work, this is a feel-good pick.

case you were counting), you can swim in the indoor pool, exercise in the
first-class fitness center, shop for antiques, and eat in a nationally
renowned restaurant, all without ever leaving the cushy confines. There’s
no reason to skimp on anything less than a club lounge room; the lounge
is the stage for a lavish buffet breakfast plus drinks and snacks throughout
the day.

With the 40-story, purpose-built St. Regis on San Francisco’s five-star
scene, you can rest assured that pampering has reached, well, new
heights. A distinctive presence on the skyline, the hotel (floors 22–40 are
residences) is awash in understated, unquestionable great taste and com-
fort, from the handsome lobby bar to the lose-yourself-in-luxe guest rooms
with deep soaking tubs, huge plasma TVs, and digitized remote control so
one needn’t rustle the high-thread-count sheets to close the window cov-
erings or signal the butler. The fitness center and spa are among the best
in town. I also like the fact that each floor holds just 18 rooms. Views begin
on the eighth floor. The hotel’s fine-dining room, Ame (see Chapter 10), is
a destination in itself. All in all, the St. Regis is swell.

The San Remo Hotel

North Beach/Fisherman’s Wharf
Staying in this 1906 building is something like bunking at a pal’s home,
because you’re going to have to share the bathrooms. Rooms are small
but adorable (they look like something your grandmother may have done
up — a long time ago), and guests are relaxed and friendly, thrilled to have
found such a bargain close to the bay. The penthouse, with a private bath-
room, is prized for its views. However, ambience from the low-income
housing project on the next block may not be the sort you crave. Laundry
facilities are available, and the Fior d’Italia (the country’s oldest Italian
restaurant) is downstairs. The rooms have no air-conditioning, televisions,
or phones.

Serrano Hotel

A stellar example of what a boutique hotel should be, the Serrano is beau-
tiful, relaxed, friendly, and well appointed. It’s a terrific hotel for tourists
as well as business travelers who don’t mind sacrificing square footage for
great value. The small rooms are full of color and amenities, and double-
paned windows effectively reduce street noise. Guest rooms on upper
floors even have city views. The Spanish Revival lobby is a gem — seating
groups are arranged beneath the handsome beamed ceiling, and it’s a con-
vivial place in the early evening when complimentary wine is served and
a tarot-card reader drops by to entertain. The pet-friendly hotel’s only
drawback, and it’s minor, is the proximity to Ellis Street, which can seem

dicey at times. In fact, it’s just a 3-block walk to Union Square and 2 blocks
to the Powell Street cable-car turnaround. Ponzu, the hotel’s excellent
restaurant, is a popular pretheater spot.

Tuscan Inn

North Beach/Fisherman’s Wharf
The pet-friendly Best Western Tuscan is a welcome change from the rest
of the chain hotels on Fisherman’s Wharf. Personality doesn’t abound, but
the rooms are fairly large by local standards, and kids like the location.
The concierge is enthusiastic and friendly, and all the amenities you
expect, including free Wi-Fi, are available. At the early-evening wine recep-
tion, you can meet your neighbors. In warm weather, the hotel restaurant
offers alfresco dining. The Argonaut Hotel, the Tuscan’s only rival on the
wharf in this comfort zone, outdoes this property in style, but I’ll bet the
rates here will be better.

The Union Street Inn
$$–$$$
The Marina/Cow Hollow
This elegant B&B has five richly appointed rooms, a carriage house in the
garden that affords extra privacy, and a choice location on a prime shop-
ping street. If you want a bit less urban color, this is a fantastic and roman-
tic retreat. The charming managers serve as concierge and cook a full
breakfast as part of the package. Guest rooms are large, but beware of the
steep stairs to the front door, which make this an impractical choice for
anyone who has difficulty walking.

Fax: 415-922-8046. www.unionstreetinn.com. Parking: $15 at a lot 11⁄2 blocks

W San Francisco
$$$–$$$$
SoMa
The recent redecoration of the lobby, bar, and guest rooms added a pleas-
ing mellowness to the W, which still attracts hip, young business travel-
ers. They generally head for the airport on Friday, leaving the playful
Eastern-themed, moderate-sized rooms available to the rest of us. Marvel
at the deluxe amenities, the iPod docking station, and the views (from the
15th floor) in the “spectacular” and corner “fabulous” rooms. A lap pool,
fitness room, Bliss spa, restaurant, cafe, bar, room service, and well-trained

Washington Square Inn
$$–$$$
North Beach/Fisherman’s Wharf
The European atmosphere in North Beach makes this little hotel a won-
derful choice; and if you plan to walk the neighborhoods, you won’t find a
better location. Less expensive rooms are small, but amenities such as
fresh flowers, continental breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening wine and
hors d’oeuvres in the antiques-filled lobby make them a terrific deal.
Recent upgrades include flat-screen televisions and free Wi-Fi. The staff
will help you with your bags and assist with tour and dinner reservations.
The hotel is nonsmoking and has a two-night minimum on weekends.
See map p. 84. 1660 Stockton St., at Filbert Street, across from Washington Square
Park. % 800-388-0220 or 415-981-4220. Fax: 415-397-7242. www.wsisf.com.

The Westin St. Francis
$$$$
Union Square
It’s all about location. A prime corner across from Union Square and a glit-
tering, bustling lobby are what give the historic St. Francis its air of excite-
ment and glamour. But underneath it all is a really big, impersonal hotel —
albeit one with 24-hour room service, concierges, shops, dining opportu-
nities (including ultraglam Michael Mina), and Westin’s Heavenly beds. In
any case, if you are here for the ambience, stick to the original (main)
building. Its moderate-sized standard doubles, with their romantic antique
chandeliers, have finally been updated. Bathrooms are on the small side,
though. Ask for a view or a corner room to get some natural light, and
avoid rooms by the ever-busy elevators. Deluxe and Grandview rooms are
the best in the house, while the standard queens are just large enough for
a single traveler. My suggestion is to stay at the Orchard Hotel and drop by
the Westin St. Francis to ride in the glass elevator or spend $15 and enjoy
the new unwind hour from 5 to 7 p.m. It offers local cheeses paired with
local wines, and the people-watching is unparalleled.
See map p. 96. 335 Powell St., across from Union Square. % 800-937-8461 or

White Swan Inn
$$–$$$
Union Square
The 26 spacious guest rooms in this English-style B&B are designed to be
lingered in. You’ll want to take advantage of the four-poster beds and fire-
places. Rates include continental breakfast buffet, afternoon tea, and

evening wine and hors d’oeuvres served downstairs in the parlor. You’ll
think you’re visiting a well-to-do British aunt. Back rooms are sunnier; the
queen rooms have showers only. As at the neighboring Petite Auberge,
advance reservations are imperative here, and smoking is not allowed.

Runner-up hotels
Having trouble finding a bed? If the hotels listed earlier in this chapter
are full, try booking one of the following accommodations. They may
have saved you some room.
Galleria Park Hotel
$$–$$$$
Union Square
This is a pleasant, small hotel in a convenient
location close to Chinatown, the Financial District, and Union Square.
Unlike most downtown properties, it has on-site parking, which is handy
for travelers who need quick access to their vehicles. An update com-
pleted in 2007 added free Wi-Fi, luxury linens, and a restful, modern teal-
and-brown color scheme. Interior rooms are a bit dark, but quieter than
streetside doubles. See map p. 96. 191 Sutter St., at Kearny Street. % 800-792-
9639 or 415-781-3060. Fax: 415-433-4409. www.galleriapark.com. Parking: $35.
Rack rates: $169–$509. AE, CB, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Hotel Diva
$$–$$$$
Union Square
Traveling with small children? This hotel’s 
2-room “Little Divas Suite,” complete with bunk beds, dress-up clothes,
and a pint-size sink, may ruin them for ordinary digs. Grown-up rooms are
a bit edgy for me, but the signature rolled-steel headboard and black
leather couches may seduce you. It has a good location, room service,
complimentary Wi-Fi, helpful staff, and a Salon Floor with upgraded ameni-
ties, including continental breakfast. See map p. 96. 440 Geary St., near Mason
and Taylor streets. % 800-553-1900 or 415-202-8700. Fax: 415-885-3268. www.hotel
diva.com. Parking: $35. Rack rates: $159–$439. Check Web site for deals. AE, DC,
DISC, JCB, MC, V.
King George Hotel
$$
Union Square
The King George’s guest rooms are minuscule, as are
the bathrooms, but the entire hotel was nicely remodeled in 2002, and the
guest rooms recently received new soft goods and a paint job. They even
have free Wi-Fi. The bar is exceedingly low-key and pleasant — the proper
English tea, served on weekends, is popular enough to require reservations.
The staff is terrific. Guest rooms for smokers are available. Check the Web
site for deals that drop the room rate as low as $109. See map p. 96. 334 Mason

Larkspur Hotel Union Square
$$–$$$$
Union Square
This pleasant hotel, formerly the Cartwright,
just emerged from renovations, but some aspects, such as room size, can’t
be modified. Standard guest rooms are on the small side (reserve a deluxe
king if you’re claustrophobic); the two-bedroom suites will suit a family.
Along with high-end in-room amenities, there’s free Wi-Fi and an afternoon
wine reception. European in feel, the well-managed, pet-friendly hotel is
convenient to Union Square and Chinatown and has a friendly, helpful staff.

Warwick San Francisco Hotel
$–$$$$
Union Square
Formerly the Warwick Regis, this is the closest
you can get to a French chateau downtown. If circa–Louis XVI armoires,
brocade fabrics, crown-canopied beds, and marble-tiled bathrooms get
your heart racing, you’re going to adore this hotel. Twice-daily house-
keeping, fresh flowers, great amenities, a restaurant/bar, and 24-hour room
service complement the intimate atmosphere. Smoking rooms are avail-
able. See map p. 96. 490 Geary St., at Taylor Street. % 800-827-3447 or 415-928-7900.

The Westin Market Street
$$–$$$
SoMa
Formerly the Argent, this Westin is a sizable convention
hotel. All of the larger-than-average rooms have been updated with signa-
ture Heavenly beds and new furniture. What earns it a place in this chap-
ter, besides a stellar location near Yerba Buena Gardens and the Museum
of Modern Art, are the nearly floor-to-ceiling windows providing great
views from rooms and suites above the 14th floor. A restaurant, fitness
center, sauna, and pretty garden also help. See map p. 96. 50 Third St., near

Chapter 10
Dining and Snacking 
in San Francisco
In This Chapter
 Assessing the latest dining trends
 Savoring the local flavor
 Reserving your table
 Finding the best places for a leisurely meal or snack
W
hether you’re a genuine gourmet or a fledgling foodie, San
Francisco has more culinary options than you can shake a nice
bunch of organic basil leaves at. But no matter where you rank yourself
on the scale of serious eating, there’s no excuse to waste a meal in this
city. Fast-food counters, chain restaurants, marketing enterprises mas-
querading as dining establishments — you’ll find them here, but do
yourself a favor and pass ’em by. Instead, take advantage of the fresh,
local ingredients and skilled chefs that keep San Francisco in the culi-
nary spotlight, and I guarantee you’ll dine to your heart’s content.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
Restaurants debut in this town with great hoopla, but what’s hot today
may be out of business by the time you turn this page. At the moment,
the newest trend is sharing. I don’t mean spilling your life story — I
mean sharing plates of food with your tablemates. Although this isn’t
news in your average Chinese restaurant, it is in other eateries, so if you
sup at Restaurant Lulu, for example, be advised that those hefty por-
tions really are meant for the entire party. On the other end of the spec-
trum, small plates, an offshoot of the Spanish penchant for tapas, are
still the rage, and they, too, are meant to be shared. This can get nasty if
three plump scallops arrive and you’re part of a party of four, so try to
dine with at least one vegetarian or be prepared to cover the tabletop
with a lot of little dishes. And, speaking of tables, communal ones crop
up in lots of new dining rooms. I don’t know if this is supposed to pro-
mote fellowship or save space, but for lone diners, large parties, or cou-
ples who are looking for fresh conversationalists, your table is ready.

Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 119

Finding the trendiest tables
San Francisco has no lack of sizzling white-tablecloth restaurants.
Getting last-minute reservations at Restaurant Gary Danko (% 415-
749-2060), Ame (% 415-284-4040), or Quince Restaurant (% 415-775-
8500; see listings later in this chapter) is tough. Call ahead — way, way
ahead — if you have your heart set on supping at these bastions of chic.
Equally challenging is wrangling a table at the always-sublime Dining
Room at the Ritz-Carlton (% 415-773-6168), where Ron Siegel (the
kitchen god who bested the Japanese television phenom “Iron Chef”) is
at the helm. And despite the increase to 200 seats with the move to the
Ferry Building, the wait for dinner at the Slanted Door (% 415-861-8032;
see listing later in this chapter) is three weeks. You might try for lunch at
the bar instead. For anyone traveling to Yountville to eat at the French
Laundry (% 707-944-2380), one of the most coveted reservations in 
the country, bookings are accepted two months to the day in advance.
OpenTable.com (see “Making reservations,” later in this chapter) has
exactly two tables available online, with a separate page devoted to 
the reasons you’re going to get frustrated getting your hands on one.
Determined eaters who can’t wait to spend $240 on a prix fixe (okay, it’s
an amazing experience) should mark their calendars and exercise their
dialing fingers, while giving OpenTable.com a try as well. Or forget about
it and eat at Keller’s Ad Hoc (% 707-944-2487; see Chapter 14).
Cooking up San Francisco cuisine
International influences are the inspiration for most Bay City menus.
This is not odd considering the ethnic makeup of the city’s population,
but it may throw you for a loop when your menu runs the gamut from
East to West with a little Southern comfort thrown in for good measure.
Restaurants serving tapas are the keenest to take advantage of various
culinary styles, and it’s a clever way for a young chef to show his or her
stuff. These small plates are also a pleasing way to order a meal. You
don’t have to choose between dishes that sound equally appealing,
because the prices are low enough, and the portions modest enough, 
to sample them all.
With its emphasis on local, organic, and sustainable ingredients,
California cuisine will always have a presence here, although it’s being
usurped by Modern American or New American cuisine. California cui-
sine features fresh, seasonal ingredients prepared in simple and light
ways. New American cuisine also uses seasonal ingredients, but what-
ever foreign cuisines interest the chef also influence the preparations.
Although the subtleties may be lost on you if you don’t deconstruct your
meals, I mention this because many new restaurants describe their cook-
ing in these terms.
Another welcome dining trend has to do with accommodating the orga-
nizationally challenged. Many excellent restaurants in town, including
Boulevard and Restaurant Gary Danko (see listings later in this chap-
ter), accommodate walk-ins with counter seats or service in their bar

areas. This is your best chance to eat at these top spots if you don’t
have reservations.
Making reservations
If you really want to experience some high-profile restaurants while you’re
in town, make sure you book a table before you get here. It’s not that the
hostess takes pleasure in turning you away on a Friday at 8 p.m. — but did
you notice all the other people drinking in the bar who also thought they
could amble in and get seated?
Besides picking up the phone, you can contact a vast number of restau-
rants through the OpenTable Web site (www.opentable.com). I’ve used
this free Internet site many times, always with excellent results. You may
also put your hotel concierge to work by requesting that he assist you
with dinner reservations. If you’re really desperate, you can show a little
chutzpah like my old friend Josephine, who has been known to march 
up to the host, look him in the eye, and announce she has reservations,
even when that’s not entirely accurate. The caveat is to make sure your
dining partners don’t buckle under pressure.
Exploring the dining zones
Cafes and restaurants often congregate on certain blocks, making it easy
to stroll down the street until an enticing odor or empty table calls out
to you. One of my absolute favorite dining destinations is pedestrian-
only Belden Place in the Financial District, a 1-block alley off Bush and
Pine streets between Kearny and Montgomery. Weekdays, in good
weather, the outdoor tables are coveted lunch spots. Two standouts on
multicultural Belden are Plouf (% 415-986-6491), a delightful French
restaurant specializing in fish and shellfish, and B-44 (% 415-986-6287;
see listing later in this chapter), a Spanish charmer specializing in paella
and Catalan dishes. North Beach is awash in Italian cafes, Italian restau-
rants of all persuasions, and some inexpensive little eateries. The family-
style Capp’s Corner, 1600 Powell St., at Green Street (% 415-989-2589),
is almost the last of the breed, where complete meals are no understate-
ment. You order a bottle of Chianti and watch as your table fills with
bread and a tureen of minestrone, a salad featuring iceberg lettuce, fol-
lowed by a huge serving of penne, and then a main course if you’ve
ordered one. Spumoni’s for dessert, natch.
The Mission District gourmet ghetto continues to explode, especially
around Valencia and 16th streets, where you’ll find the popular creperie
Ti Couz, 3108 16th St. (% 415-252-7373), and Bar Tartine, 561 Valencia
St. (% 415-487-1600), the Cal-Med brasserie opened by the brilliant team
from Tartine Bakery at 18th and Guerrero streets (% 415-487-2600).
Mexican-food lovers should try Pancho Villa, 3071 16th St., at Valencia
Street (% 415-864-8840), which draws a crowd with its fresh, inexpen-
sive burritos, tacos, and specialty platters, or Taqueria Cancun, 2288
Mission St., between 18th and 19th streets (% 415-252-9560), which
stays open until 2 a.m. on weekends. The mood in this neighborhood is

The Mission District
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 125

casual and urban; it’s home to students, artists, a large Hispanic commu-
nity, and a fair number of street people. Parking requires patience and
luck, but there’s a BART stop at 16th and Mission — a rather dicey sta-
tion, so you may want to take a cab home.
You can take the N-Judah streetcar to Irving Street and Ninth Avenue,
near Golden Gate Park, to find another great couple of blocks of moder-
ately priced, high-quality restaurants. Chow, 215 Church St. (% 415-
552-2469; see listing later in this chapter), has a location here, and the
good Japanese and Thai restaurants nearby include Ebisu, 1283 Ninth
Ave. (% 415-566-1770).
Discovering off-the-beaten-track restaurants
Restaurants are mining new territory, as evidenced by the dozens of
places opening in neighborhoods most visitors would have shunned
once upon a time. The blocks around Dolores, Valencia, and Guerrero
streets in the Mission District from 16th to 23rd streets are just one
example. Storefronts and former corner markets have become the
domain of chefs hoping to create the next big thing. Delfina, 3621 18th
St., at Guerrero Street (% 415-552-4055; see listing later in this chapter),
is one of the area’s pioneers. If you can’t wrangle a table there, line up at
Dosa (% 415-642-3672; see listing later in this chapter) for South Indian
cuisine, or Farina, 3560 18th St., at Guerrero Street (% 415-565-0360).
The handkerchiefs of house-made pasta are the stuff of dreams.
Glen Park, a little neighborhood not far from the outer Mission, is most
definitely off the tourist track. It’s so easy to reach, however, that if
you’re staying anywhere near a BART station, you’re practically there
already. Simply head south from the Embarcadero and exit at the Glen
Park stop. You are now 1 to 2 blocks from some excellent eating. Join the
line waiting for a table at Gialina, 2842 Diamond St. (% 415-239-8500).
Chef Sharon Ardiana’s wild nettle pizza with pancetta is easily the best
pie I have ever eaten (and I am not exaggerating). Share a locally farmed
arugula salad to start, sip some wine, and you’ll return to your hotel feel-
ing like a savvy local. Otherwise, pick up your cellphone and make reser-
vations at either Chenery Park, 683 Chenery St. (% 415-337-8537), or
Le P’tit Laurent, 699 Chenery St., at Diamond Street (% 415-334-3235).
The former is a bastion of solid American cuisine, while the latter offers
authentic French, including a tarte Tatin that would make Carla Bruni
blush with pleasure. Laurent offers a $20 three-course menu until 7 p.m.
Monday through Thursday — the bargain of the year.
Sampling San Francisco’s ethnic eats
As in other big cities, certain neighborhoods in San Francisco are hubs
for particular regional cuisines. You can find several ethnic enclaves,
with Chinatown the most obvious example. Head to North Beach, thick
with trattorie and bakeries, for authentic Italian. Not to be outdone, the
Mission District abounds with terrific, inexpensive taquerias, and you
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
126

can see Central American cafes alongside new gourmet restaurants. The
tasty, authentic fare is worth the trip.
Over in the Richmond District (see Chapter 8), you’ll notice a clutch of
Russian bakeries, delicatessens, and restaurants, most notably Katia’s,
A Russian Tea Room, 600 Fifth Ave., at Balboa Street (% 415-668-9292),
open Wednesday through Friday for lunch and Wednesday through
Sunday for dinner. You can also find many more Asian and Chinese eater-
ies in the Richmond District. Another local Asian favorite is Ton Kiang,
5821 Geary Blvd., near 23rd Avenue (% 415-386-8530), open daily for
excellent dim sum, lunch, and dinner. Call for evening reservations.
Japantown is bargaintown when it comes to dining. Inside the Japan
Center on Post Street (at Webster Street) are a number of noodle houses
and sushi bars, with more across the way. Mifune, 1737 Post St., Ste. 375
(% 415-922-0337), upstairs in the Japan Center, is a perennial favorite
for big bowls of udon noodles in broth with slices of beef or chicken and
vegetables. It’s open until 9:30 p.m. Sunday to Thursday, until 10 p.m.
Friday to Saturday. Isuzu, 1581 Webster St. (% 415-922-2290), is a great
spot for sushi or tempura.
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
Do not head to the nearest fast-food counter, even if your travel budget
doesn’t allow for a $100 dinner for two every night. You can limit the
stress on your credit card, and save your waistline, if you share an appe-
tizer and dessert, or order beer instead of wine, or bring a favorite bottle
of vino (you’ll have to pay a corkage charge), or skip the alcohol entirely.
(The markup on wine is usually outrageous!) If you’re dying to try a cer-
tain restaurant that’s way too expensive, have lunch there instead of
dinner, if it’s open; you’ll get the same quality of food for less money. Or
you can eat brunch or have an inexpensive picnic lunch and direct your
savings toward a really nice dinner.
The best choice for inexpensive, flavorful dishes is one of the city’s
many ethnic restaurants. Taxi to the Tenderloin for Vietnamese, Indian,
and Pakistani; to the Mission District for cheap Mexican, Salvadoran,
and Cambodian food; to Geary and Clement streets in the Richmond
District for Vietnamese, Chinese, and Thai; and to Japantown for tem-
pura and noodles. Your wallet will thank you, and your taste buds will
still be satisfied.
San Francisco’s water, supplied from Hetch-Hetchy up in Yosemite, is
possibly the best in the nation. It’s so good that most restaurants are
happy to eschew the Evian and deliver a pitcher of the local H2O to your
table. Save your money for a bottle of California wine.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 127

So, what are you in the mood for? Chinese? California-Mediterranean?
Catalan tapas? Pho? There’s no reason to go hungry seeking the right
restaurant. Due to space considerations, the recommendations in this
chapter only scratch the surface of my favorite places. What you have
here is a representative cross-section of the best the city has to offer, in
a variety of price ranges and neighborhoods. And unless the kitchen is
having an off night, there’s not a lemon in the bunch.
Restaurants that I’ve designated with the Kid Friendly icon have items on
the menu that most kids like, and they’ll treat your children with respect.
If things like crayons at the tables and booster seats are important to
your little ones, call the restaurants directly for more information.

Experiencing dinner as theater
Foreign Cinema in the Mission District (% 415-648-7600; see listing later in this chap-
ter) screens films on a wall in the patio, which is handy if you don’t have much to say to
your date. For live entertainment to accompany your meal, stay tuned.
San Francisco has always had its fair share of fair maidens, many of whom shave twice
daily, and there is no better or safer place to gawk at “gender illusionists” than AsiaSF,
201 Ninth St., at Howard (% 415-255-2742). This SoMa nightclub/restaurant serves small
plates of fusion dishes (such as duck quesadillas) at the bar and on small tables. Once
an hour, the “ladies” lip-synch to pop hits while strutting down the vinyl bar in very high
heels and tight jeans. It could not be tackier, but the food is okay and the wait staff is very
sweet.
Down at Pier 29 on the Embarcadero, look for a stylized 1926 Spiegelent (a circular,
tented pavilion), the home of Teatro ZinZanni (% 415-438-2668; www.teatrozin
zanni.org). Tickets are $116 to $140, and shows run Wednesday through Sunday. This
is an immensely hilarious dinner show with a twist: The audience is part of the pro-
ceedings. Don’t worry — you won’t be asked to get up and recite. Along with an accept-
able, if not stellar, five-course meal (it reminds me of hotel wedding suppers), diners are
entertained by a talented group of performers, who combine cabaret, opera, acrobat-
ics, comedy, and improv in most unusual ways. The cast changes periodically; strangely
enough, Joan Baez has appeared occasionally, so it’s worth investigating who’s in the
lineup when you come to town. This isn’t a cheap date, but it’s something to consider if
you’re celebrating or looking for an evening out of the ordinary.
And for something completely different, slip into supperclub, 657 Harrison St. between
Second and Third streets (% 415-348-0900; www.supperclub.com), an offshoot of
the Amsterdam original. Be prepared to spend your entire evening here, lounging bare-
foot against the pillows that surround your bed/seating area, drinking, eating, watch-
ing, listening, participating, and giving yourself over to whatever the experience offers.
Every night it changes somewhat. Expect performance art, wandering masseuses, cos-
tumes, drag queens, DJs, and who knows what else. A set five-course meal of varying
consistency costs $60 on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and $70 on Friday
and Saturday. Secure reservations at least one month in advance.

The dollar signs attached to the restaurant recommendations in this chap-
ter give you an idea of how much you’ll have to shell out for dinner for
one person, including appetizer, main course, dessert, one non-alcoholic
drink, tax, and tip. A city-mandated health-care initiative has driven some
restaurants to add a surcharge to the bill, while others have increased
prices to help pay for employee health insurance.
If a place is marked with $, a meal there will run $30 or less. At $$ places,
expect to spend between $31 and $60. Restaurants with $$$ will cost
from $61 to $100. Feel like going for broke? You’ll sup on fine china in
sedate surroundings and then fork over lots more than $100 at $$$$
places. To locate a restaurant based on its cost, location, or cuisine, see
the indexes at the end of this chapter.

The Marina/Cow Hollow
ITALIAN
A-16 refers to the highway through the Campania region of Italy (Naples is
the major city), and the menu at this stylishly spare restaurant not only
reflects the cuisine of southern Italy but also uses ingredients from the
area. Favorite dishes include burrata, a delicious mozzarella with a soft,
creamy center; various house-cured salumi; and, among a handful of excel-
lent main courses, halibut with Meyer lemons and almonds. You’ll also find
a choice lineup of authentic Neapolitan pizzas and pasta dishes. I love the
varied seating options here — an outdoor patio, butcher-paper-covered
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 129
Dining and dancing
The Top of the Mark in the InterContinental Mark Hopkins hotel, 1 Nob Hill, at Mason and
California streets (% 415-616-6916), has it all — views, music, dancing, and a convivial
crowd of suits. The hotel serves a $59 prix-fixe dinner on Friday and Saturday nights;
with 7:30 p.m. reservations (the band starts at 9 p.m.), a night on the town is a done deal.
Harry Denton’s Starlight Room, in the Sir Francis Drake Hotel on Union Square, 450
Powell St. (% 415-395-8595), attracts tons of hotel guests and locals who appreciate
the Starlight Orchestra, the drop-dead views, and the adult prom-night atmosphere. It’s
a glorious room for drinking expensive glasses of whatever, dancing, and having a little
bite. Reservations on the weekend are advised. A younger, hip group congregates at
Cafe du Nord, below the Swedish American Hall, 2170 Market St., at Sanchez Street (%
415-861-5016; www.cafedunord.com). The basement-level club serves a reasonably
priced dinner (sandwiches, salad, chicken, and steak), but the draw is the live music.
Check the Web site to see which shows are “all ages” (usually offered upstairs) if you
have teens along. Cafe du Nord is open seven days a week, although it doesn’t always
schedule live music Sunday and Monday.

Absinthe Brasserie & Bar
$$$
Civic Center/Hayes Valley
FRENCH
I recommend this warm-hearted restaurant a short cab ride from Union
Square for a cozy dinner with your beloved (or a really good friend). You
can’t miss with a selection from the oyster bar or a classic frisée salad to
start. Depending on the day, the chef may be cooking like a grandmère,
preparing French onion soup or confit of pork. Absinthe is a hot spot for
preconcert dining, so you may want to book a table after the curtain and
savor the romantic room and seasonal menu. Weekend brunch is busy
(arrive just before 11a.m.), but you can walk in for lunch if you’re shop-
ping in the neighborhood.

NEW AMERICAN
Husband and wife Hiro Sone and Lissa Doumani, of the brilliant Terra in
St. Helena, created this restaurant at the stunning St. Regis Hotel. The pair-
ing is another perfect match. There’s no need to speed to the Napa Valley
for Sone’s signature sake-marinated, broiled black cod and shrimp
dumplings in shiso broth — a blessing considering the price of gasoline.
If the sashimi bar doesn’t waylay you, start with the delicious burrata
cheese bruschetta and spring vegetable “bagna cauda,” if only to admire
the beauty of the composition. The quietly luxe room feels deceptively
casual; the service meets the high standards of the globally inspired menu.

bottle of wine and plates of crispy-skinned chicken, fresh pasta, grilled sir-

Where to eat when you don’t 
have reservations
Not every restaurant accepts reservations, and among those that do, some keep tables
for walk-ins. Others accommodate free spirits in the bar. If it’s getting late and you forgot
or didn’t get around to deciding where to eat, try any of the following:
Restaurants that don’t take reservations: Brenda’s, Chow, Park Chow, Gialina, L’Osteria
del Forno, Pizzeria Delfina, SPQR, Tadich Grill, Tommaso’s Restaurant
Restaurants that serve in the bar or at a counter: Absinthe Brasserie & Bar, A-16, Bistro

Home, Jardinère, Kokkari Estiatorio, Le P’tit Laurent, Restaurant Gary Danko, the Slanted
Door, SPQR, Tadich Grill, Town Hall

fresh, usually organic ingredients and a quirkiness in design that even dour
people can appreciate. My friend Vicki, who is a regular, always orders the
Sonoma duck confit (or tries to — the menu changes daily), but plenty of
other diners can’t pass on the smoked bacon and cornmeal fried oysters
over greens to start, or the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. Vicki’s boys
(husband included) consistently order a few sides of macaroni covered in
Spanish goat’s cheese, whether they need it or not. Sit in the back room by
the patio, or on the patio itself, weather permitting.

AMERICAN
Housed in an elegant turn-of-the-20th-century building with views of the
Bay Bridge (from tables in the very back only), this favorite of both visitors
and locals serves excellent, generous plates of seasonal comfort food.
Noisy but comfortable, the place caters to an upscale, older crowd. Start
with the pan-seared foie gras, before the food police run it off the menu.
Main courses might include tender lamb chops or lamb osso buco accom-
panied by local asparagus in season. Counter and bar seating is available

BREAKFAST/CREOLE
Open only for breakfast and lunch, this tiny storefront on a bleak block not
far from City Hall is proof that a great biscuit is the culinary equal of a
better mousetrap. Everyone interested in good food is beating a path to
Brenda Buenviaje’s door, loving the grits that accompany her maque choux
(veggie) omelet or ordering a flight of beignets (there are four kinds,
including a savory crawfish) as a starter. Her fried oyster po’ boy is second
to none, including any you’d find in New Orleans, which happens to be
Brenda’s hometown. There’s likely to be a line waiting for a table (put your
name on the list), but if there’s a stool at the counter and you are impa-

Butterfly
$$$
The Embarcadero
PAN-ASIAN
This is a beautiful restaurant on the water, a comfortable place to take in
the bay, with drinks and maybe some oysters before the sun sets. Butterfly
started in the Mission (where the original is now a bar/lounge), and its
roaring success led chef-owner Robert Lam to salvage this room with a
view after the previous owners couldn’t weather the last economic down-
turn. Lam’s use of local ingredients in recipes that pick and choose from
various Asian cuisines makes for unusual eating. If you’re in the mood for
something different, try crispy, fried whole fish with kimchi, black bean
sauce, and Chinese sausage. You won’t know what to admire more — the
shimmering water or your dinner plate.

Canteen

Union Square
CALIFORNIA
Minuscule Canteen is the domain of the much-admired chef Dennis Leary,
whose bona fides include four years at Rubicon prior to opening this 20-
seat upscale diner. The fact that you’ll need a reservation even to eat at
the counter (the place has but four tiny booths), should clue you in that
this is an unusual venture. Leary does the shopping as well as all the cook-
ing, and his menu changes weekly to reflect what he finds appealing. If
you’re staying around Union Square, breakfast is stellar, especially the
smoked salmon omelet or stuffed pancake. Work the phones to land a
dinner seat, or come for lunch and see what all the fuss is about.

Among them is this destination for couture tapas in the Hotel Adagio. The
buzz is palpable from the bar and the Mondrian-meets-Miro dining room.
The surprise (if you’re mistrusting of glitz) is that the small plates — such

R&G Lounge

Chinatown
CHINESE
Downstairs, you get excellent Hong Kong Chinese dishes in a setting that
reminds me of an airport lounge, with lackluster service. The small dining
room upstairs is more attractive, so talk your way to a table up there. In
either case, you’ll have a chance to order live spot shrimp from the down-
stairs tank and fresh, crisp vegetables such as Chinese broccoli and yin
choy (a leafy green vegetable with a red root, often boiled and then braised
with garlic).

Range
$$
Mission District
CALIFORNIA
Range is a prime example of the modern San Francisco neighborhood restau-
rant. Opened by a kitchen-savvy husband and wife team (Cameron and Phil
West), it offers a small, seasonal menu that features flavor over flash, backed
by charming service. Coffee-rubbed pork shoulder is a favorite, and Range’s
delicate take on meat and potatoes — pan-roasted, thinly sliced bavette
steak (cut from the short loin) with narrow fingerlings — satisfies on a more
primal level. Two simple yet warm dining rooms, fronted by an attractive
bar, allow for conversation, a nice touch given how often restaurants seem
designed to make that impossible.

Restaurant Gary Danko
$$$$
Russian Hill
FRENCH/NEW AMERICAN
The ovens were barely lit at this fine-dining center before the food and
wine cognoscenti were all over Danko’s like hollandaise, proclaiming it
among the best restaurants not only in town but in the country. They were
right. Choose your own three-course (or more if you like) meal from the
menu — perhaps a composed lobster salad followed by day-boat scallops,
ending with a Meyer lemon soufflé or selections from the cheese cart —
then let the kitchen make magic. If you don’t mind eating at the bar, you
can walk in without reservations.

Restaurant Lulu
$$
SoMa
MEDITERRANEAN
With the buoyant feel of a lively Provençal brasserie, the mouthwatering
scent of the oak-fired rotisserie, and a lengthy menu of appealing dishes,
Lulu seduces on many levels. If you’re anywhere near Yerba Buena Center,
don’t think twice about having lunch or dinner at this local institution.
Most dishes are meant to be shared, such as the daily rotisserie specials,
the wonderful rosemary-scented chicken, and an antipasti plate of your
own design. Dinnertime can be pretty noisy, but you’ll be surrounded by
a buzz of happiness from the throng at the bar, emanating throughout the
cavernous room.

The Embarcadero
VIETNAMESE
The city’s premier Vietnamese eatery occupies the city’s premier location —
the glorious Ferry Building. Savvy travelers and locals pour in for the but-
tery steamed sea bass, caramelized chicken, and plates of “shaking” beef.
Even if dinner reservations seem impossible to come by, call at 5:30 p.m. the
evening you want to dine and see whether there is a cancellation. You may
get lucky. You even need a reservation for lunch, especially since the James
Beard Foundation named chef Charles Phan Best Chef in California in 2004

$$
Pacific Heights
ITALIAN
Tables at this wildly popular little place are so close together that if you
don’t make new acquaintances while waiting in line, you’ll certainly do so
once you sit down and eye what the guy next to you is eating. Everyone
starts with a combination of at least three hot, cold, or fried antipasti. You
can’t go wrong with any of them, but the fried Brussels sprouts are
deservedly a big favorite. Continue with house-made pasta, or just cut to
the chase and order dessert. The rice pudding is lovely.

If you’re making the rounds of old San Francisco, lunch here or at Sam’s
Grill, 374 Bush St. (% 415-421-0594), is mandatory. This turn-of-the-last-
century watering hole, with waiters to match, features a daily printed

that they’re probably the next big thing (like liberals, or walking). Order
defensively: Stick with whatever fresh fish is available and the delicious
creamed spinach.

1300 Fillmore
$$$
Japantown/Western Addition
AMERICAN/SOUTHERN
Anchoring the new Fillmore Jazz Heritage blocks, within walking distance
of Japantown, upmarket 1300 is a fine place to spend an evening. Start in
the attractive bar, where you can listen to the jazz trio while sipping a cock-
tail from the expansive drinks menu. When your table is ready, linger over
shrimp hush puppies before tucking into some organic fried chicken or a
grilled pork chop. Try not to fill up on the excellent cornbread, or you
won’t be able to eat dessert; the banana cream pie is worth the sacrifice.
Although it’s kind of expensive, 1300 is more fun than similarly priced
North Beach or Union Square restos.

Tommaso’s Restaurant
$$
North Beach
ITALIAN
The specialty at this old-time basement restaurant is pizza; the wood-fired
brick oven dates from 1935 and is credited with inspiring Wolfgang Puck
to build one a lot like it. Bring a big appetite or plan to share — portions
are generous. Spinach salad, full of slivered almonds and dressed with a
reduced balsamic, is a good way to start and will easily feed two. Lasagna
is a point of pride in the kitchen, and all the old-school recipes are avail-
able, including eggplant Parmigiana and chicken marsala. Tommaso’s is a
local favorite, so plan to wait for a table.

Town Hall
$$$
SoMa
NEW AMERICAN
The latest destination spot to wow the city that knows how to eat (I saw
Robin Williams there), Town Hall oozes confidence like Tom Cruise at the
end of a rope. Heavy hitters from the local cuisine scene, most prominently
the Rosenthal brothers of Postrio fame, automatically raised the restaurant’s
profile, and their cooking will keep it in the big leagues. If you like New
Orleans–style dishes — multiflavored, multitextured, ample portions —
you’ll love the cornmeal-fried oysters with baby spinach, covered in a jazzy
bacon dressing, and scallops with andouille sausage jambalaya. There’s
nothing shy about this food, and you don’t have to share unless you really
want to.

Japantown/Western Addition
JAPANESE/SUSHI
Connected to the popular jazz club of the same name (see Chapter 16),
the airy, high-ceilinged restaurant at Yoshi’s empties a bit after the show
starts. You may find it easier to get a table then. Sushi and sashimi are pris-
tine and gorgeously arranged on white ceramic plates; the variety and
presentation will please even sushi snobs. Tempura of seasonal organic
vegetables is as politically correct (and tasty) as anything deep-fried is
allowed to be. The upstairs lounge has a view of the kitchen, providing a
show in itself, and you can order from the bar menu.

There’s always a palpable buzz from the smartly dressed crowd hanging
about Zuni’s copper bar drinking vodka, snarfing oysters, and waiting for

signature roast chicken with bread salad for two is downright divine. Don’t
opt for an outside table; the view on this section of Market Street isn’t all
that pleasant.

Dim sum 101
I wasn’t sure what to expect the first time I tried dim sum, way back when. I’ll 
admit — and only because you were kind enough to buy this book — that I was a little
hesitant. The idea of eating these Chinese dumplings, filled with ingredients I couldn’t
identify at first, was a bit scary. But I’m delighted to report that I quickly overcame my
initial wariness and now adore dim sum. If you haven’t tried it, I urge you to do so.
In many Chinese restaurants, dim sum is served from late morning until around 2 p.m.,
but not later. In fact, if you arrive past 1 p.m., you run the risk of the kitchen’s losing inter-
est in providing much of anything to eat. It’s best to arrive around 11 a.m. Dim sum gen-
erally enters on carts wheeled about the room by waitresses. (Otherwise, you order
from a menu.) Ask for a table near the kitchen in order to get first crack at whatever’s
on its way around the room. The ladies with their carts will stop by your table and show
you what they have. If it looks appealing to you, nod or say, “yes”; if not, just say, “no,
thanks.” It’s okay to order slowly — finishing one plate, sipping tea, and then ordering
something else. By the way, if you run out of tea, open the teapot lid.
Here’s a rundown of dim sum that first-timers will definitely enjoy:
 Har gau: Shrimp dumplings encased in a translucent wrapper and steamed
 Siu mai: Rectangles of pork and shrimp in a sheer noodle wrapper
 Gau choi gau: Dumplings filled with chives, alone or with shrimp or scallop
 Jun jui kau: Rice pearl balls with seasoned ground pork and rice
 Law mai gai: Sticky rice with bits of meat and mushrooms wrapped in a lotus leaf
 Char siu bau: Steamed pork buns — bits of barbecued meat in a doughy roll
 Guk char siu ban: Baked pork buns — bits of barbecued meat in a glazed roll
 Chun guen: Spring rolls — smaller, less crowded version egg rolls
 Gau ji: Potstickers —thick, crescent-shaped dough filled with ground pork
Where to go
Those in the know consider Yank Sing one of the premier dim sum houses in town. It’s
also the most expensive, although you get a lot in terms of quality and surroundings. On
the Embarcadero at Rincon Center, 101 Spear St. (% 415-957-9300; www.yank
sing.com), and at 49 Stevenson St., near First Street (% 415-541-4949; lunch only).
In Chinatown, Gold Mountain is typical of the cavernous dim sum parlors that serve
hundreds of families on the weekends. 644 Broadway, near Stockton Street (% 415-
296-7733).
Attractively decorated City View is a very good spot for dim sum, particularly popular
with Financial District workers and comfortable enough for a business lunch. The ladies
who walk about with the trays and carts of dim sum all speak English, which is com-
forting if you really want to know what they’re serving. 662 Commercial St., between
Kearny and Montgomery streets. (% 415-398-2838; lunch only).

Dining and Snacking on the Go
With the exception of Fisherman’s Wharf, where people attempt to walk
while balancing bread bowls filled with questionable clam chowder,
street food is practically nonexistent in San Francisco. (Although, in a
very weak moment, and for research purposes only, I once bought a hot
dog from a cart on PIER 39.) But that doesn’t mean you should seek out
the closest fast-food chain for a meal on the go. Instead, head to one of
the many sandwich counters, Asian bakeries, Italian delis, coffeehouses,
and pastry shops that provide a grand variety of delicious foodstuffs
quickly and for reasonable to downright cheap prices.
Whether you’re feeling a bit peckish or positively peaked, you’ll find
something tempting to tide yourself over until the next big meal.
Have food, will travel
Just 2 long blocks west of the Ferry Building on the Embarcadero, next
to Pier 5, is a bench-lined, refurbished wooden wharf with fine views that
practically begs for an impromptu picnic lunch. Plenty of other spots
around the city beckon you to unpack a brown bag, too.
You can generously fill your lunch pail at Molinari Delicatessen, a
second-generation, family-run Italian place with a fantastic assortment 
of cheeses, inexpensive Italian wines, and friendly people who make
excellent sandwiches to go. It’s at 373 Columbus Ave. in North Beach 
(% 415-421-2337) and is open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
and Saturday 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Also in North Beach, on the corner of Columbus Avenue and Kearny
Street, is a Parisian-inspired Italian cafe owned by the director Francis
Ford Coppola. Surprisingly, Cafe Zoetrope (% 415-291-1700; www.cafe
zoetrope.com) — part wine bar, part kitchen store — serves the most
delicious muffuletta (olive salad, mortadella, ham, salami, and provolone)
outside of New Orleans. This sandwich once made my husband so
ecstatic he squirreled away half to eat the following day. The cafe is open
from 11 a.m. until 10 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and opens at noon on
weekends, closing at 10 p.m. Saturday and 9 p.m. Sunday. It’s closed
Monday.
In the Financial District at Palio Paninoteca, 505 Montgomery St., near
California Street (% 415-362-6900; www.paliopaninoteca.com), $7.75
gets you a panini large enough for two. Fillings range from grilled vegeta-
bles or meat to smoked prosciutto with Gorgonzola, mascarpone, and
arugula. It’s closed weekends. Weekdays, it’s open from 6:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Prefer a salad? Mixt Greens, 120 Sansome St., at Bush Street (% 415-
433-6498), provides a lovely range of made-to-order, organic gourmet
salads (and a selection of sandwiches) that you can eat on premises or
take away. The SoMa location, at 560 Mission St., between First and
Second streets, is convenient to the Embarcadero. Both shops are open
weekdays 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 145

Closer to Union Square, with two other locations in the Financial District,
is Specialty’s Cafe & Bakery, 1 Post St., at Market Street (% 415-896-2253
or 877-502-2837; www.specialtysdirect.com). This spot is popular for a
vast array of fresh sandwiches served on made-from-scratch breads. It’s
closed on weekends. Weekdays, it’s open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.
The Ferry wonderful Building
If you only had a few hours to spend in San Francisco, I’d send you to the
splendidly remodeled Ferry Building on the Embarcadero at the foot of
Market Street. A landmark completed in 1898, the building gradually fell
into disuse after the Bay Bridge opened in 1936, allowing commuters
from the East Bay to drive, rather than take a ferry, into the city. The revi-
talization of the Embarcadero seems complete now that the clock tower
shines beaconlike in the evening, and the Ferry Building marketplace is a
hub once more, drawing people from around the Bay Area. Open every
day (a few shops close on Sun), the light-filled space houses the best
local purveyors of food and food-related items. To grab a quick bite, food
to go, a picnic, or a complete meal, you can find something satisfying just
by making a tour of the open-front shops. Some highlights: Hog Island
Oyster Company oyster bar, with gorgeous bay views from the counter;
Mastrelli’s Delicatessen, the sister store to Molinari Delicatessen in
North Beach, where you can order freshly made sandwiches to go; and
Golden Gate Meat Company, a small counter that sells lunch meats as
well as organic meats— my pastrami sandwich emitted such a delicious
odor and looked so luscious, I actually had people stopping me to ask
where I’d bought it. You’ll also find a Japanese deli, a French rotisserie,
chocolate, gelato, cookbooks, and gifts.
Down on the farm — farmers market, that is
Twice a week, the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market operates in front of and
behind the Ferry Building. Basket- and canvas-sack-wielding shoppers
pick over the heirloom tomatoes and grab the last of the wild strawber-
ries while juggling coffee and cellphones. The simple beauty of the
organic vegetables and flowers makes a walk around the market an enor-
mous pleasure, despite the crowds. The Hayes Street Grill and Rose
Pistola restaurants cook gourmet breakfasts at outdoor booths on
Saturdays, and other vendors sell items such as bottles of olive oil, jars
of local honey, and exotic orchid plants. This is also a great place to
gather picnic food — fresh bread, artisan cheeses, and fruit — for later
in the day. The F-Market streetcar drops you almost at the door. The
market operates Tuesday (open: 10 a.m.–2 p.m.), but the day to visit is
Saturday, when the selection of vendors is wider and the hours are
longer (open: 8 a.m.–2 p.m.).
Snacking at the wharf
Let’s be frank. PIER 39/Fisherman’s Wharf is the most touristy part of
town. The restaurants that crowd Jefferson Street exist for the people
who are here today and gone tomorrow. I’ve learned to accept this, if not
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
146

to embrace it, and I’m not going to sneer at anybody who spends part of
a day here on the way to Alcatraz or just to see what all the fuss is about.
But let’s say that this person is hungry. Let’s say that this person has
heard about all the crab vendors and the sourdough bread and thinks to
himself, “That sounds like lunch to me.” This is what I’d suggest: Buy a
bottle of beer, buy a little round of sourdough bread, and ask one of the
guys at a crab stand (try Fisherman’s Grotto No. 9) to cook, clean, and
crack a live crab for you. Then take these goodies and lots of napkins
through the doors marked “Passageway to the Boats,” walk down this
relatively quiet area, sit on the dock, and have a good time. Remember:
The local Dungeness crab season is from November through May. In the
summer, the crabs are flown in from Alaska or parts east.
Unless you purchase a freshly cracked crab, rest assured that the 
$5.25 crab cocktail you ordered is made of canned crab — or even imita-
tion crab.
Boudin Bakery (the sourdough bread people) operates a nifty demon-
stration bakery/cafe/museum on Fisherman’s Wharf, 160 Jefferson St., at
Taylor Street (% 415-928-1849). You can watch bread being prepared
from a glass-walled catwalk suspended above the action, take a tour,
sample the wares, and tuck into your soup at indoor and outdoor tables.
Boudin created San Francisco’s distinctive sourdough loaves in 1849,
and for an icon, they taste pretty darn good.
Flour power
You can have a swell time hunting and gathering among the bakeries in
North Beach. For starters, drop by Liguria Bakery, on the corner of
Stockton and Filbert streets (% 415-421-3786), for a sheet of plain focac-
cia, or maybe one topped with green onions or tomato. They’re all deli-
cious and wrapped for portability. Liguria is open every day by 8 a.m. and
closes when the last piece of focaccia is sold, usually by 2 p.m. I also love
Victoria Pastry Co., 1362 Stockton St., at Vallejo Street (% 415-781-2015),
which sells a large selection of Italian sweets (the chewy almond cookies
are good enough to give as a gift) and slices of its justly popular cakes.
Citizen Cake, 399 Grove St., in Hayes Valley (% 415-861-2228), creates
homemade cookies, cakes, and desserts that ignite a love/hate relation-
ship between your taste buds and your hips. The spacious cafe also
serves lunch and dinner Tuesday through Friday (8 a.m.–10 p.m.) and
brunch and dinner on weekends (Sat 10 a.m.–10 p.m.; Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.)
It’s near the stylish Hayes Street shopping blocks, which makes eating
and spending so efficient.
A small chain of Boulangerie Bay Bread bakery/cafes has popped up in
the Haight-Ashbury, Cow Hollow, Fillmore, and Russian Hill neighbor-
hoods. My favorite is Boulange de Polk, 2310 Polk St., at Green Street
(% 415-345-1107). Along with lovely French pastries (the cannelés de
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 147

Bordeaux are swoon-worthy), you can order savory tarts, sandwiches,
and salads to go or to eat at one of the coveted outdoor tables.
Chinese bakeries
Chinese bakeries, which sell savory as well as sweet items, abound in
Chinatown, in the Sunset District on Irving Street, and in the Richmond
District on Clement Street. For snacking on the premises or on the go,
delicious baked or steamed pork buns (baked buns are golden brown,
and steamed buns are white) are ideal. They’re also a big hit with kids. If
you want something on the sweet side, custard tarts and sesame-seed-
covered balls of rice surrounding a bit of sweet bean paste are standard
issue. Look also for bo lo bow, slightly puffy and sweet bread with a
crust that resembles the outside of a pineapple, or chung yow bow,
green-onion bread. You may have to point to whatever looks appetizing,
because the folks behind the counter don’t necessarily speak English.
Coffee and tea, if you please
Places to sit and sip are as prevalent as pigeons in this caffeine-crazed
piece of paradise. Coffeehouses — and I’m not even including the mega-
chains — nestle in every neighborhood, seemingly on every block. I
don’t think drinking coffee as a lifestyle was invented in North Beach,
but based on sheer numbers, it could have been. Regulars have their
favorite blends and favorite tables, but no one will argue against hanging
out at Mario’s Bohemian Cigar Store on the corner of Columbus Avenue
and Union Street (% 415-362-0536). Along with excellent coffee
(Graffeo), you can graze on a mouth-watering chicken parmigiana on
focaccia. Caffe Trieste, Vallejo and Grant streets (% 415-982-2605; www.
caffetrieste.com), is a mob scene on Saturday afternoon, when the
owners and friends take turns singing at the microphone. Coffee is
served daily with or without opera. The roasting apparatus at Caffe
Roma, 526 Columbus Ave. (% 415-296-7942), sits up front near the door.
If you ask, and the staff members aren’t busy making the perfect cappuc-
cino, you could learn about the life cycle of the coffee bean.
Although that Seattle-based coffee Goliath continues to snap up real
estate in a quest to make everyone drink frappuccinos, we have our own
local chain to kick around. Actually, caffeine aficionados worship Peet’s
Coffee & Tea. If you love really strong coffee, it’s worth dropping by one
of the many stores. The one closest to Union Square is in the Financial
District at 22 Battery St., at Bush Street (% 415-981-4550; www.peets.
com). You can also try the shop on Chestnut Street between Steiner and
Pierce streets in the Marina (% 415-931-8302) or the one in the Ferry
Building (% 415-593-3831). They’re all open daily. In Hayes Valley, the
community kaffeeklatsch takes place on the pavement in front of a
custom furniture workshop at 30 Linden St., an alley off Gough Street.
Look for the seemingly makeshift bar of the Blue Bottle Coffee Co., pro-
genitor of the Blue Bottle Cafe (see the next section). You can eavesdrop
or make new friends while waiting in line for a good strong cup.
Part III: Settling into San Francisco 
148

Self-described coffee snobs have little choice but to drop by Ritual Coffee
Roasters, 1026 Valencia St. in the Mission (% 415-641-1024). The beans
come from Portland, Oregon’s Stumptown Coffee. The roomy storefront
has a glass case filled with treats, free wireless, and long hours (open:
until 11 p.m. Mon–Sat, until 9 p.m. Sun).
The peaceful Imperial Tea Court, in the Ferry Building on the
Embarcadero (% 415-544-9830), is a must stop in which to rest your feet
and take stock of your life — or maybe just the last half-hour — over a
pot of exotic leaves and blossoms that would make Celestial Seasonings
think twice. This is the place to sample the highest-quality teas as they
were meant to be brewed, and the staff is happy to show you how it’s
done. Open weekdays 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.,
Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Breakfast of champions
Touring is hard work; you need a good breakfast. Around Union Square,
you can find lots of restaurants serving in the morning, including the
Grand Cafe (% 415-292-0101) on Geary next to the Hotel Monaco, 
open daily; and Dottie’s True Blue Café, 522 Jones St., between Geary
Boulevard and O’Farrell Street (% 415-885-2767). Dottie’s is my favorite
after Brenda’s (see listing this chapter). Open Wednesday through
Monday only, it’s a tiny diner that offers daily specials as well as the
basics — eggs, pancakes, sausage — all prepared with great flair. The
baked goods are so delicious you may want to purchase some to go.
Expect to wait in line on the weekends. When the lines at Dottie’s and
Brenda’s appear too daunting, just walk over to Café Mason, 320 Mason
St. between Geary and O’Farrell streets (% 415-544-0320), for all kinds
of fruit-enhanced pancakes, eggs any way, or maybe yogurt and fresh
fruit. Prices are reasonable for Union Square, and the food’s fine. Across
from the Chinatown gate is Café de la Presse, 352 Grant Ave. (% 415-
398-2680), very European in feel, with excellent lattes, croissants, newspa-
pers, and lots of windows. Lines here move faster than you might think.
Bechelli’s, in the Marina/Cow Hollow neighborhood at 2346 Chestnut St.,
between Divisadero and Scott streets (% 415-346-1801), serves a sub-
stantial breakfast until 3 p.m. during the week, and until 4 p.m. Saturday
and Sunday. To my mind, the booths, scruffy leatherette chairs, and
beat-up, horseshoe-shaped wooden counter add to the charm of this
neighborhood institution, but more important, the breakfast menu is
nearly as huge as the portions. Buttermilk pancakes, French toast, home-
made corned beef hash, and lots of omelets could potentially hold you
for a good part of the day. Kids often enjoy bellying up to the counter,
and the place has a very relaxed, family-friendly atmosphere. No reser-
vations; credit cards are accepted.
Hidden on an alleyway very near the Westfield Centre on Market and
Fifth is the hippest spot in town for coffee and a bite, as evidenced by
the crowd there on an otherwise deserted Sunday morning. Blue Bottle
Cafe, on the corner of Mint and Jessie streets, between Market and
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 149

Mission streets (% 415-495-3394), siphons its coffee into glass containers
and serves it with a selection of dishes, including beautifully browned
Belgian waffles. Open weekdays 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
and Sunday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., it’s a tight squeeze and a welcome change to
this part of the neighborhood.
Around the Embarcadero at 2 Townsend St. is the aptly named Town’s
End (% 415-512-0749), one of the great places for a traditional brunch.
The selection of dishes is comprehensive (from blintzes to huevos
rancheros), the quality is high, and the prices are fair. But if you are just
as content to have a couple of fried eggs, bacon, and hash browns with a
view of the bay, cross the street and walk toward the ballpark. Look for a
little shack with a few outdoor tables next to the South Beach harbor at
Pier 40. This is the Java House (% 415-495-7260; www.javahousesf.
com), an institution since 1912. Cash only, and you’ll have to bus your
dishes yourself.
Finally, if you have a soft spot for diners — and I mean the real thing, not
Happy Days replicas — make your way to the end of Geary Boulevard
(the name changes to Point Lobos Avenue) where it meets the Great
Highway. The little joint overlooking the old Sutro Baths is Louis, 902
Point Lobos Ave. (% 415-387-6330), which opened in 1937 and has an
endless view of the Pacific Ocean. Louis serves breakfast and lunch daily
from 6:30 a.m. It’s nothing to write home about, but there’s something
comfortable and familiar about the décor (linoleum, worn booths) and a
big plate of eggs over easy, country ham, and hash browns. This is a fine
place to eat before hiking along the Coastal Trail, golfing at Lincoln Park,
or heading to Golden Gate Park. Cash and traveler’s checks only.
Pizza and other cheap eats
Although I’m known to criticize fast food, I consider pizza an exception.
Good pizza can make a perfectly satisfying, easygoing, low-rent meal.
And although San Francisco doesn’t have the reputation of New York or
Chicago, you won’t have any difficulty finding a ready slice in any neigh-
borhood.
Uncle Vito’s Pizzadelli, on the corner of Bush and Powell streets (% 415-
391-5008), serves credible pies with a big selection of toppings, good
salads, and enough pasta dishes to carbo-load for the next day’s adven-
tures. Uncle Vito’s is inexpensive and convenient to Nob Hill and Union
Square, so you’ll see lots of foreign tourists here, attempting to put
together just the right combination of pizza and beer. When shopping on
Fillmore Street, stop by Dino’s Pizzeria (% 415-922-4700) to check up on
sports scores and dig into one of Dino’s thick-crusted, cheesy creations.
It’s on the corner of Fillmore and California streets, where you’ll often find
Dino at the door eyeing passersby and chatting up the regulars.
If too much exposure to coddled food makes you long for a touch of
grease, you can find a couple of places to deal with your craving for 
hamburgers, fries, and a shake. Mo’s Grill, which makes many kinds of

burgers, is South of Market at Folsom and Fourth streets, on the south-
west side of Yerba Buena Gardens (% 415-957-3779). You can also find a
branch in North Beach on Grant Street, between Vallejo and Green streets
(% 415-788-3779). Because I have a soft spot for ’50s-patterned Formica
and bright colors, my favorite place to chew the fat is Burger Joint, 807
Valencia St., in the Mission (% 415-824-3494). And, despite my protesta-
tions against fast food, Taylor’s Refreshers at the Ferry Building makes a
great burger and a greater milkshake. Anyway, they aren’t that fast.
North Beach also shelters at least two eateries specializing in roasted
chicken, the older being Il Pollaio, 555 Columbus Ave., between Union
and Green streets (% 415-362-7727). A very casual place to sit down for
savory chicken and other meats and salads, this is where you go when the
kids start rolling their eyes if you mention dim sum or sea bass. It’s also a
good choice when you’re tired of spending too much money on dinner.
Adventure eaters in the mood for Indian food will barely feel a strain 
on their pocketbooks at Shalimar, 532 Jones St., between Geary and
O’Farrell streets (% 415-928-0333), another Formica-tabled hole-in-the-
wall in the Tenderloin/Union Square area. Order at the counter, sit at
your table, watch for your food to come up, and then enjoy delicious
curries, savory naan bread, and tandoori. It’s open daily for lunch and
dinner; cash only. Another highly recommended restaurant in the
Tenderloin, and attractive enough for a date, is the Bodega Bistro, 607
Larkin St. at Eddy Street (% 415-921-1218). The pho ga, Vietnamese
chicken noodle soup, is simply wonderful, due in part to brilliant
chicken stock. Another can’t-miss dish is papaya salad, but in fact, the
dishes here are some of the best in the category. If you are uncomfort-
able in the neighborhood, come for lunch. Cash only.
The real dill
Oh, happy day. A genuine delicatessen, with bagels imported directly
from New York, exists right here in San Francisco. You don’t know how
we suffered before Miller’s East Coast Delicatessen started with the
chicken soup and the matzo balls, not to mention the pastrami, the pick-
led herring, and the brisket (every bit as good as mine, if not better).
Located at 1725 Polk St. (% 415-563-3542) and open daily, this is also a
fine place to get sandwiches to take with you for the trip home — I
wouldn’t want you to go hungry.

Part IV
Exploring San
Francisco

In this part . . . 
N
ow you get to the main course. This part tells you
about the landmarks and neighborhoods that deﬁne
San Francisco to the world. And you know what? Most of
them are worthy of their star billing.
How do you take in everything? That depends on how much
time you have. If you have only a day or two, a guided tour
may be the best way of at least seeing, if not savoring, the
sights. Or you can pick and choose from a list of a few places
to explore, spend some quality time at each, and plan to
come back to the city another time to catch the rest. If you
have three or more days to wander, take a look at my sug-
gested itineraries for an idea of how to absorb as much of the
city as possible.
Don’t forget the shopping opportunities while the pleasure of
browsing in one-of-a-kind stores is still possible. An entire
shopping chapter awaits, and it’s ﬁlled with suggestions for
ﬁnding interesting clothes, gifts, and foods that you won’t see
in your local mall. Leave room in your suitcase — it’ll be
heavier on the trip home.
You’d think it would be enough for me to help you plan your
trip to San Francisco, a marvel among big cities, but no . . . 
I toss in a few extra treats for your dining and sightseeing
pleasure. Chief among them are trips to the gorgeous Napa
and Sonoma valleys, where the sights and scents of grapes
and olives act like a restorative. Closer still is Berkeley, a
microcosm of Northern California life that revolves around
the university and a vibrant dining scene. Finally, nature boys
and girls will have a veritable ﬁeld day hiking, kayaking, or
seeking the perfect cracked crab in the quaint hamlet of Half
Moon Bay.

S
omething is bringing you to San Francisco. Perhaps you’ve been
overcome by recollections of old Rice-A-Roni commercials (“the San
Francisco treat [ding ding!]”) that became synonymous with cable cars.
Or maybe visions of the Golden Gate Bridge spanning the icy waters of
the bay are pulling you to the left coast. Are the views from your window
a bit too flat? Is the thrill-seeker in you ready for the action our hills pro-
vide to drivers and passengers alike? Did you manage to schedule a
week off from work, and coming to San Francisco just seemed like a
good idea? Whatever your reasons for choosing this city, I don’t think
you’ll be bored, and I know you won’t be disappointed.
You may be curious to understand firsthand why this city is different
from any other urban center in the United States, and why its residents
are so passionate about where they live. After a few days making your
way around, you may glean some of the reasons, the most apparent of
which is the sheer beauty of the setting. There’s more, of course. You
never know what you’ll see when you look carefully. Take those cable
cars, for example: Sure, they’re a fun ride, but as you climb aboard,
observe the gripman (or gripwoman — there’s one) and the other pas-
sengers, and note how the neighborhoods change as you head from
Union Square through North Beach or past Nob Hill. Even watching the
passersby on the pavement is an experience. I’ll always remember how
heads turned (and kept turning) to follow a gorgeous girl in black leather

pants as she sashayed up Mason Street. It was certainly the first time
I’ve ever been on a cable car that intentionally moved backward!
The following list gives you a quick reference of the features that make
San Francisco, well, San Francisco.
San Francisco’s Top Attractions
Alcatraz Island
Fisherman’s Wharf
Hollywood movies, including Birdman of Alcatraz, Escape from Alcatraz,
and The Rock, have recast what is essentially an early-20th-century ruin
in San Francisco Bay into a hugely popular tourist site. Even if you’re famil-
iar with this former military fort and federal prison only from vague refer-
ences to its famous prisoners — Al Capone, “Machine Gun” Kelly, Robert
(the Birdman) Stroud — you’ll find the self-guided tour of the cell house
strangely moving. I credit this to the excellent audio guide, which includes
remembrances narrated by former guards and prisoners, and to the low-
key manner in which Alcatraz is presented. No attempt is made to glam-
orize the inmates or to condemn the system. This was a cold, isolated,
maximum-security prison housing the most hardened criminals of the day,
which coincidentally offered them glimpses of an enticing city, perhaps
invoking longing and regret. Imagining what life here was like isn’t all that
difficult, but at the moment you begin to feel inklings of pity for the incar-
cerated, a vividly told story of an attempted prison escape reminds the
listener that these inmates were, for the most part, remorseless. Before or
after the cellblock tour, you’re invited to view an orientation video. During
fall and winter, you can tour the island itself on a walking path that begins
near the ferryboat landing. (The trail is closed from mid-Feb through early
Sept, during bird-nesting season.) Park rangers are around to answer ques-
tions, and they often give talks on the history of the prison and famous
escapes. Bring a jacket as well as comfortable shoes for the steep walk to
the cell house. A tram is available once an hour to take wheelchair users
or anyone unable to make the walk up to the prison. The Alcatraz experi-
ence takes about 21⁄2 hours, including the ferry ride.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco

Saving on entrance fees
Your timing has to be right, but if you’re in the neighborhood, take advantage of free
museum days. Entry is free to the California Academy of Sciences and the
Exploratorium on the first Wednesday of every month; to the Asian Art Museum on
the first Sunday of the month; and to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the
Legion of Honor on the first Tuesday of every month. Every Thursday after 5 p.m.,
admission is reduced at the Asian and at MoMA, and they stay open until 9 p.m.

To get the full effect of what being an inmate may have been like, try the
Alcatraz Night Tour. The prison becomes especially sinister after the sun
goes down, so use discretion before deciding to bring kids along. The tour
is available Thursday through Monday only; the ferry departs at 6:10 p.m.
and 6:50 p.m. (4:20 p.m. during the winter).
During the summer, you must reserve tickets far in advance for the ferry
ride to the island, and tickets purchased are valid only on the date and time
indicated on the ticket. Order tickets over the Web site, or call % 415-981-
ROCK to buy them over the phone.
See maps p. 162 and p. 171. Pier 33, at Fisherman’s Wharf for location of ferry depar-
tures. % 415-981-7625. www.AlcatrazCruises.com or www.nps.gov/
alcatraz. Open: Winter daily 9 a.m.–1:55 p.m.; summer daily 9 a.m.–5:25 p.m. Ferries
run approximately every half-hour; arrive at least 20 minutes before sailing time. 
F-Market streetcar, Powell-Mason cable car (the line ends a few blocks away), or 
30-Stockton bus. Admission (includes ferry and audio tour): $25 adults, $23 seniors 62
and older, $15 children 5–11. Night Tour: $32 adults, $29 seniors, $31 kids 12–17, $19
children 5–11.
Asian Art Museum
Civic Center
The new Asian Art Museum holds one of the largest collections of Asian art
in the Western world, covering 6,000 years and encompassing the cultures
of Japan, China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. Housed in Golden Gate Park
until 2003, the Asian gathered public and private funds to renovate the
interior of the old Beaux Arts Main Library and create 37,500 square feet
of exhibition space (and if that doesn’t invigorate Civic Center, I’m not sure
what will). Although the collection remains more than enough reason to
visit, the renovation has also attracted plenty of attention. The design is
by Gae Aulenti, the Milanese architect who turned the former d’Orsay train
station in Paris into the popular Musée d’Orsay. The Asian is compact, and
it won’t take you more than a few hours to see all the galleries. Cafe Asia
on the first floor is open from 10 a.m. for drinks and Asian-influenced
dishes served cafeteria style.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 161
Getting around and in with Citypass
Citypass (www.citypass.net) is a booklet of discounted tickets to six major 
attractions — the Museum of Modern Art, Palace of the Legion of Honor and de Young
museums, Aquarium of the Bay, and Exploratorium or Asian Art Museum, and a Blue
& Gold Fleet Bay Cruise. The price includes a seven-day Muni Passport, making the
pass quite a bargain for those who are ambitious enough to use all the coupons; they’re
valid for nine days from the date of purchase. The cost is $54 for adults, $44 for kids,
online or at the participating attractions.

Cable Cars
Union Square/Financial District
San Francisco’s most notable icon is probably the cable car. These cher-
ished wooden cars creak and squeal up and around hills while passengers
lean out into the wind, running the risk of getting their heads removed by
passing buses. San Francisco’s three existing lines make up the world’s only
surviving system of cable cars, and they are a delight to ride. The sheer joy
of whizzing down a hill with the bay glistening in the foreground will linger
in your memory. But these legendary icons aren’t just fun — they’re also a
useful means of transportation. The Powell-Mason line wends its way from
the corner of Powell and Market streets through North Beach and ends near
Fisherman’s Wharf. If you have time to ride the cars only once, this is the
one I’d recommend. It will take you most of the way to Fisherman’s Wharf,
or, if you prefer, you can hop off when you get to North Beach. The Powell-
Hyde line, which starts at the same intersection, ends up near the
Maritime Museum and Ghirardelli Square. The somewhat less thrilling,
but less crowded, California line begins at the foot of Market Street and
travels straight up California Street over Nob Hill to Van Ness Avenue.
I thought I had a foolproof method of avoiding the crowds at the cable-car
turnarounds (which is literally where the cars are turned around at the
end of the line) by waiting 2 blocks from the Powell Street turnaround, but
after forcing my visiting brother to watch as one full car after another
passed us by (“And you do this professionally?” he said), my only other

From maximum prison to 
maximum attraction
Alcatraz Island was discovered in 1775. Taking advantage of its strategic location in
San Francisco Bay, the U.S. Army began building a military fortress atop “The Rock.”
From 1850 to 1933, it served as a military post and army prison, housing Civil War,
Spanish-American War, and, finally, civilian prisoners. In 1934, it was converted into a
maximum-security prison. The prison was home to famous gangsters such as Al Capone;
Robert Stroud, the so-called Birdman of Alcatraz (because he was an expert on ornitho-
logical diseases — he never kept birds on Alcatraz); and “Machine Gun” Kelly. Twenty-
nine prisoners tried to escape from Alcatraz. Two made it ashore, only to be captured
almost immediately, and five presumably drowned, although their bodies were never
recovered. All 29 attempts are said to have failed. The prison closed in 1963, due to dete-
rioration of the buildings and prohibitive maintenance costs. Alcatraz became part of
the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1972.

suggestion is to get up early to ride. (It turns out we were waiting at what
the hotel doormen refer to as “Fantasy Island.”) You can also try walking
a few more blocks to the next stop. (Brown signs with a white cable car on
them indicate stops.) Although at first it will appear that there’s no room
among the zillions of passengers already on the car, by magic a foothold
may open up. Otherwise, go get in line with a coffee. Cars run from 6:30
a.m. to 12:30 a.m. The fare is $5 per person one-way, payable on board;
Muni Passports are accepted. For more information, call Muni at % 415-
673-6864 or log on to www.sfmta.com. See Chapter 8 for more details,
including a route map on p. 80.
Chinatown
Crowded with pedestrians and crammed with exotic-looking shops and
vegetable markets whose wares spill onto the sidewalks, Chinatown is a
genuinely fascinating destination. Take your time as you walk through this
enclave, home to the largest Chinese population outside of Asia — it’s easy
to miss something. The Dragon Gate arch at Grant Avenue and Bush Street
(just a few blocks north of Union Square) marks the entry to Chinatown.
To get a more authentic experience, explore the side streets and alleys off
Grant Avenue. If you stay for lunch or dinner, your adventure will take
about a half-day. Walking from Union Square is the sensible way to get here,
but you can also reach Chinatown by taking the 30-Stockton bus — quite
an experience during rush hour. Parking is nearly impossible, but if you
want to try it, your best bet is on Kearny Street under Portsmouth Square.
(See Chapter 10 for dining suggestions and Chapter 12 for shopping point-
ers.) While you’re in Chinatown, don’t miss the following highlights.
The Chinese Historical Society of America is a good place to begin. A
museum and research center, the Historical Society documents the fasci-
nating story of the Chinese in California through photographs, art, and
changing exhibits. Its bookstore stocks fiction and nonfiction titles on
Chinese themes.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 165
The steel wheels tour
The famous cable cars you see going up and down the hills of downtown San Francisco
were invented in 1869 by Andrew Hallidie. Hallidie saw the need for a new mode of trans-
portation when he witnessed a horse-drawn streetcar slide backward down one of the
many steep slopes that make up San Francisco’s unique topography. Here’s how the
cable-car system works: A steel cable sits just under the street in a rail, kind of like an
inside-out train rail (it’s the cable that makes that clickity-clacking sound). Powered by
electricity, this cable constantly runs through the rail. Each cable car has a lever that,
when pulled back, closes a pincerlike “grip” on the cable. The person who pulls the
lever is called a gripper — some would call this person a driver, but he doesn’t drive, he
“grips” the cable. The cable car is then attached to the cable that runs through the rail
under the pavement, and the car begins to move at a constant 9 mph — the speed at
which the cable is set to travel.

See map p.166. 965 Clay St. % 415-391-1188. www.chsa.org. Admission: $3 adults,
$2 seniors, $1 children 6–17; free first Thurs of the month. Open: Tues–Fri noon to 
5 p.m., Sat 11 a.m.–4 p.m.
Tin How Temple, one of the oldest Chinese temples in the United States,
is dedicated to the Goddess of Heaven, protector of fishermen. The temple
is open to the public, but please keep in mind this is an active house of
worship. Be prepared to climb a narrow staircase to the top floor, and
make an offering or buy some incense on your way out.
See map p. 166. 125 Waverly Place, off Clay Street between Stockton and Grant
streets. No phone. Admission: Free. Open: 9 a.m.–4 p.m. daily.
Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Company is a working factory where you
can buy bags of fresh, inexpensive almond and fortune cookies (in choco-
late or vanilla). You may find the cramped quarters somewhat claustro-
phobic, but watching rounds of dough transmogrify into cookies is fun.
See map p. 166. 956 Ross Alley, between Jackson and Washington streets near Grant
Avenue. No phone. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–7 p.m.
Portsmouth Square, a park above the Portsmouth Square parking garage
on Kearny Street between Washington and Clay streets, marks the spot of
the original settlement of San Francisco and is the site of the first California
public school, which opened in 1848. A compact but complete playground
attracts the neighborhood preschoolers and, in the morning, elderly
Chinese people practice their tai chi exercises. The landscape includes
comfortable benches, attractive lampposts, and young trees. The dis-
tinctly San Francisco view includes the Transamerica Pyramid looming
above the skyline. The garage below is a good place to know about if
you’re driving. Interestingly, the garage’s fourth floor is most likely to have
empty spaces, because in Cantonese, the word for four sounds like the
word for death. Superstitious Chinese won’t park there.
The pedestrian bridge over Kearny Street leads directly into the third floor
of the Hilton Financial District, where you’ll find the Chinese Culture
Center. A gift shop leads to the gallery, where changing exhibits may fea-
ture photographs from pre-earthquake Chinatown, Chinese brush paint-
ing, or embroidered antique clothing and household items. The center also
offers two-hour docent-led heritage walks for groups of 4 or more by reser-
vation; $18 adults and $10 kids under 12.

Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Coit Tower
Telegraph Hill (near North Beach)
Erected in 1933 with funds bequeathed to the city by Lillie Hitchcock Coit,
this 210-foot concrete landmark is visible from much of the city. But every-
one needs to take a closer look to see the beauty of the tower. The décor
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 167

inside features dramatic murals inspired by and commissioned during the
Great Depression. Take an elevator to the top for panoramic views of the
city and the bay. This diversion will probably take about 30 minutes from
start to finish.
See map p.162. Atop Telegraph Hill. % 415-362-0808. Take the 39-Coit bus, or walk
from Lombard Street where it meets Telegraph Hill Boulevard. (2 blocks east of
Stockton Street). Parking: The drive up and the parking lot are always a mass of cars.
Admission to top of tower: $4.50 adults, $3.50 seniors, $2 kids 6–12. Open: Daily 
10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Contemporary Jewish Museum
SoMa
The newest addition to the Yerba Buena cultural mix is the long-awaited
Contemporary Jewish Museum. You can admire the dramatic Daniel
Libeskind–designed building, which incorporates elements from the his-
toric Jessie Street Power Substation, from various angles, including the
patio outside Ducca alongside the Westin Market Street (see Chapter 10).
An exploration of modern perspectives on Jewish culture, history, art, and
ideas, it mounts temporary exhibits ranging from an examination of the
writer Gertrude Stein to a sound piece commissioned and curated by musi-
cian John Zorn. Should you have a chance to visit before October 2009, be
sure to stop by the StoryCorps Outpost that’s been based at the museum
for one year. Families with young children can pick up an art pack at the
front desk that will help engage the kids as they explore the premises.
Admission isn’t necessary to eat at the museum’s cafe or visit the gift shop.
A plaza that fronts the museum is a lovely link to Yerba Buena Gardens
across the street.
See map p.178. 736 Mission St., between Third and Fourth streets. % 415-344-8800.
www.thecjm.org. Take any Muni streetcar to the Montgomery Street Station or
the 15-Third, 30-Stockton, 45-Union/Stockton or any Market Street bus. Admission:
$8 adults, $6 seniors and students, free for kids under 19. Open: Mon, Tues, Fri–Sun
11 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Thurs 1–8:30 p.m. Closed Wed.
Exploratorium/Palace of Fine Arts
Marina District
Scientific American magazine rates the Exploratorium “the best science
museum in the world,” and it’s certainly an intriguing space that appeals
to all ages. The hands-on exhibits explore topics such as technology,
human perception, and natural phenomena. Well-written text accompa-
nies the exhibits to enhance the learning experience. Don’t worry about
feeling like a science dunce if you’re visiting with children; a well-informed
volunteer is ready to field any questions you can’t answer. Expect to spend
two hours minimum exploring the museum, especially if you’re traveling
with kids. Allow more time, and make reservations, if you want to experi-
ence the popular Tactile Dome, a pitch-black geodesic dome that you have
to feel your way through. A walk around the grounds of the Palace of Fine
Arts, which now houses the Exploratorium but was originally built for the
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
168

1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, is a great way to unwind
after exploring the museum. Better yet, if the weather’s balmy, bring a
picnic and stay awhile.
See map p. 162. 3601 Lyon St., at Marina Boulevard. % 415-561-0360. www.
exploratorium.edu. 30-Stockton bus to Marina stop. Parking: Free and easy.
Admission: $14 adults; $11 students, youth 13–17, and seniors; $9 kids 4–12; free kids
under 4; free for all first Wed of the month; tactile dome: $17 (includes general admis-
sion) all ages. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Fisherman’s Wharf
Don’t be confused when you arrive at Fisherman’s Wharf and see lots of
people wandering around, none of whom appear to fish for a living. This
was once a working set of piers, but today it’s a seemingly endless outdoor
shopping mall masquerading as a bona fide destination. Some people
enjoy examining the refrigerator magnets and cable-car bookends stocked
in one olde shoppe after another; others, dazed in the presence of so much
kitsch, plan their escape. Still, because most folks stop by the wharf for
one reason or another, here’s a rundown of what’s there.
No matter the weather, tourists crowd PIER 39, a multilevel, Disneyesque
shopper’s dream (or nightmare). Arcades, lined with deafening video
games, anchor the pier on each end. You can also find T-shirt and sweat-
shirt shops and plenty of fried food. Join the mob if you want to take in
the views of Alcatraz visible from the end of the pier or watch the huge
sea lions that loaf around on the west side of the pier (follow the barking).
Catch the ferry to Alcatraz or for bay cruises as well. If you’re hungry, stop
by the only authentic place to eat, the Eagle Cafe (% 415-433-3689;
www.eaglecafe.com), open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. on the second
floor. This inexpensive breakfast and lunch joint opened in 1920. If you’re
arriving by car, park on adjacent streets or on the wharf between Taylor
and Jones streets. Note: The parking garage charges $6 per hour! Do your
best to avoid the price gouging and don’t bring a car here. Besides, taking
the F-Market down the Embarcadero is much more fun (see Chapter 8).
The giant fish bowl known as the Aquarium of the Bay is dedicated to the
creatures that inhabit the San Francisco Bay ecosystem (so don’t go look-
ing for tropical species). After a brief introduction to the underwater
world, facilitated by a loquacious band of naturalists, visitors descend to
a moving walkway that slowly leads through two clear tunnels surrounded
by 700,000 gallons of filtered bay water. Many thousands of fish swim by,
some seemingly chasing their lunch. If you’ve ever wanted to be practi-
cally face to face with a Prionace glauca, this is your big chance. The last
exhibit contains touch pools, always a hit with children. Should a trip to
the Monterey Bay Aquarium be in your future, you can easily skip this
smaller cousin, but for something with an educational component on the
wharf, this is a refreshing stop.
See map p. 171. PIER 39 Fisherman’s Wharf. % 800-SEA-DIVE. www.aquarium
ofthebay.com. Admission: $15 adults, $8 seniors and kids 3–11, $38 for a family
ticket. Add $6 for the “Behind the Scenes” tour. Open: Winter Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–6 p.m.,
Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–7 p.m.; summer daily 9 a.m.–8 p.m.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 169

The San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park is a small two-story
museum overlooking the bay and Alcatraz. Examining the model
schooners, figureheads, and photographs illustrating the city’s maritime
heritage takes only 15 minutes, although children may lose interest after
the first five minutes. Still, it’s sweet and admission is free. The museum
will be closed for remodeling, however, until mid-2009.
See map p. 162. Bathhouse Building at the foot of Polk Street. % 415-561-7100.
www.nps.gov/safr.
The National Park Service operates a visitor center inside the Argonaut
Hotel (see Chapter 9), which partners with the Maritime National
Historical Park. Along with exhibits and an educational center, the rangers
working the desk can answer questions about special events on the Hyde
Street Pier.
See map p. 84. Hyde and Jefferson streets. % 415-447-5000. http://www.nps.
gov/safr/planyourvisit/the-visitor-center.htm. Admission: Free.
Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
If you have small children (or anyone interested in history) along, you
won’t want to miss touring the USS Pampanito. This submarine saw active
duty during World War II and helped save 73 British and Australian pris-
oners of war. The family pass (for two adults and up to four children) also
gets you into the Hyde Street Pier (see following).
See map p. 171. Pier 45. % 415-561-6662. Admission: Submarine with 20-minute audio
tour $9 adults, $5 seniors and students, $3 children 6–12, free for kids under 6; family
pass $20. Open: Winter daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m., summer until 8 p.m.
At the Hyde Street Pier, 2 blocks east of the Maritime Museum, you can
roam around on a number of historic, refurbished ships. Of particular note
is the Balclutha, an 1886 square-rigger with an interesting past. During
the year, activities on the Balclutha include concerts, sea chantey sing-
alongs, and children’s events. Call for a schedule. Touring the vessels takes
at least an hour or so.
See map p. 171. % 415-556-6435. Admission: $5 adults, free for kids under 16. Pier
open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Ghirardelli Square, which is the site of the original Ghirardelli chocolate
factory, is across the street from the Maritime Park. Granted landmark
status in 1982, the series of brick buildings is home to some unique stores
and restaurants, and sponsors a roster of special events, including an
annual chocolate-tasting benfit in September. At the moment, the south
end of the square is under construction and, in partnership with Fairmont
Hotels and Resorts, will emerge as a private residence club.
See maps p. 162 and p.171. Bordered by Polk and Hyde streets to the east and west,
Beach and Bay streets to the north and south. % 415-775-5500. www.ghirardelli

Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 171

Go 1 block east of Ghirardelli Square and you find what was once the
largest peach-canning facility on earth. Today, the Cannery at Del Monte
Square features shops, jugglers, musicians, and food. Visitors especially
enjoy Lark in the Morning (% 415-922-HARP), a music haven with an
array of early music and modern instruments. Gift shoppers of a practical
bent and people with newly formed blisters will also love Sock Heaven
(% 415-563-7327), which, as the name implies, sells foot coverings, in
both silly and conventional patterns.
See map p. 171. At the foot of Polk Street, on the western edge of the Embarcadero.
% 415-556-3002. Take the Powell-Hyde cable-car line to the last stop; the F-Market
streetcar; or the 19-Polk, 30-Stockton, 42-Downtown Loop, or 47-Van Ness bus.
Parking: Pricey lots and garages; street parking is difficult. Admission: Free. Open:
Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Golden Gate Bridge
You can walk the bridge, bike the bridge, or drive the bridge, but whatever
you do, don’t miss the bridge. The quintessential San Francisco landmark
spans 17⁄10 miles and soars hundreds of feet above the water. Bundle up
against the windy conditions, and then set out from the Roundhouse on
the San Francisco side of the bridge lot (see “Especially for hikers,” later
in this chapter, for information on walking to the bridge). It can get pretty
noisy, but the views can’t be beat. Remember that the only way to return
from the other side is on foot, so know your limits before crossing the
entire bridge and finding out you’re too tired to make it back. Afterward,
take some time to climb below the span to see the 5-acre garden there. The
28–19th Avenue or the 29-Sunset buses deposit you across from the view-
ing area, right by a parking lot. If you’re driving, take 19th Avenue or
Lombard Street and pay attention to the sign that indicates when to exit
for the parking lot. Otherwise, enjoy your drive across the bridge: There’s
a $5 toll upon your return to the city.
See map p. 162. Highway 101 North. www.goldengatebridge.org. Admission:
Free for pedestrians; $5 toll per southbound car. Open to pedestrians: Daily 5 a.m.–
9 p.m. on the east sidewalk.
Golden Gate Park
Once nothing but a sand-covered tract, today’s glorious Golden Gate Park
features 1,017 acres of greenery and cultural attractions. San Franciscans
do just about everything here, from playing soccer to sailing model yachts
to throwing family reunions. On Sunday, when John F. Kennedy Drive
closes to street traffic, bicyclists ride with impunity, and in-line skaters
converge for dance parties. On Sundays from April through the middle of
October, the Golden Gate Park Band plays from 1 to 3 p.m. in the
Spreckles Temple of Music, between the new de Young Museum and the
new California Academy of Sciences. A massive Children’s Playground
and a beautifully restored carousel sit just past the grand park entrance on
Stanyan Street (off Waller Street). This remodeled entrance, for some
reason, reduced the rather large number of street people who used to hang
out there (the Haight seems to attract youthful transients and burnouts)
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
172

but didn’t completely eliminate the panhandling. In any event, don’t let
that keep you away. Another entrance at Ninth Avenue on Lincoln Way
brings you to the Strybing Arboretum and the Japanese Tea Garden.
Joggers and parents pushing baby strollers make regular use of the path
around man-made Stow Lake. It’s the perfect place to take advantage of a
sunny day by renting a paddleboat and having a picnic. The boathouse
(% 415-752-0347) also rents bikes and in-line skates by the hour, half-, and
full day. If you aren’t driving, it’s a bit of a walk to the boathouse, which is
west of the Japanese Tea Garden on Martin Luther King Drive. It’s open
daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
See map p. 174. www.parks.sfgov.org. The N-Judah Muni Metro streetcar
drops you off on Ninth Avenue and Judah Street; from there it is a 3-block walk to the
park. Numerous bus lines drive close to or into the park, including the 44-
O’Shaughnessy, which you can catch on Ninth Avenue, the 21-Hayes, the 71-Haight-
Noriega, and the 5-Fulton. You can also transfer to the 44-O’Shaughnessy from the
38-Geary bus on Sixth Avenue. Open daily. Contact individual attractions for hours
and admission prices.
California Academy of Sciences
Golden Gate Park
Always a must on the tourist trail, the rebuilt California Academy of
Sciences is now a world-class destination for students of architecture, sus-
tainability, and the natural sciences. A favored weekend haunt of San
Franciscans for decades, it is not to be missed. The new building, designed
by Pritzker Prize–winning architect Renzo Piano and opened in September
2008, is a marvel from top to bottom. Inside, a rain forest dome spirals up
three stories, highlighting a different ecosystem on each floor. The
Morrison Planetarium is back, with regularly scheduled shows featuring
all your favorite stars (sorry — couldn’t stop myself), and Piano recreated
the African hall from the original building, only better, adding a display
area at one end for African penguins. On the basement level, the aquarium
includes the world’s deepest coral reef, tanks filled with fish and seahorses
and jellies, and a swamp with genuinely scary alligators. An early-child-
hood playroom, a cafe, and well-stocked gift shop make this an ideal outing
for families. When you can tear yourself away from all the wonders within
the walls, take the elevator to the roof. Planted with 2.5 acres of native
plants tucked into coconut fiber containers, it’s not merely beautiful, it’s
a model of energy efficiency.
See map p. 162. Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr., off John F. Kennedy Drive. % 415-379-8000.
www.calacademy.org. Admission: $25 adults, $20 seniors over 64 and youths
12–17, $15 kids 7–11, free for children under 7. Free third Wed of the month. $3 dis-
count with Muni transfer or fast pass or bike. Open: Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun

Prefabricated in Ireland in 1875 and erected in the park around 1878, it
reopened in 2003. Rare orchids, ferns, tropical plants, and a 100-year-old
philodendron rescued from the wreckage are on exhibit.

The de Young Museum
Golden Gate Park
San Francisco Chronicle publisher, M. H. de Young founded the city’s first
fine arts museum in 1895. Its eclectic permanent collection today includes
American paintings as well as sculpture, textiles, African and Oceanic
objects, furniture, and contemporary crafts housed in a sprawling, copper-
clad three-story complex that opened in 2005. If you want to make some

sense of the collection, consider taking one of the free docent tours offered
daily at 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and 2 p.m. A highlight of the building is the
144-foot tower offering unobstructed views (if the sky is clear) of the neigh-
borhoods beyond the park and the living roof of the Academy of Sciences
across the way. Access to the tower is free, even if you visit the museum.
The menu at the museum’s cafe (salads, sandwiches, a few mains such as
steamed halibut) features local producers and seasonal produce.
See map p. 162. 50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr., off John F. Kennedy Drive. % 415-750-
3600. http://www.famsf.org/deyoung. Admission: $10 adults, $7 seniors, $6
students and kids 13–17, free for children under 13. $2 discount with Muni transfer
or fast pass. Open: Tues–Sun 9:30a.m.–5:15 p.m., until 8:45 p.m. Fri.
The Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Gardens
Golden Gate Park
This splendid oasis houses over 6,000 species of well-tended plants, flow-
ering trees, and theme gardens. It is exceptionally lovely in late winter

when the rhododendrons blossom and wild iris poke up in corners, and
there is no more peaceful a place when it’s rainy and gray outside. You can
catch a free docent tour offered daily at 1:30 p.m.; I recommend it for those,
like myself, who are arboreally and botanically challenged when trying to
identify any but the most basic of flowers and trees. Plan to spend at least
half an hour here just wandering around.
See map p. 162. Ninth Avenue at Lincoln Way, left of the tour bus parking lot by the
Music Concourse. % 415-661-1316, ext. 314, for docent tour information. www.sf
botanicalgarden.org. Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–4:30 p.m.,
Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Japanese Tea Garden
Golden Gate Park
Enjoying this tranquil spot, with colorful pagodas, koi ponds, bridges, and
a giant bronze Buddha, you feel as though you’ve been transported for a
moment to the Orient. Young children find this part of the park particu-
larly memorable — they can climb over a steeply arched wooden bridge,
just as I did when I was much younger and lots more limber than I am
today. The Tea Garden’s beauty is slightly marred by its gift shop, full of
miniature license plates and other junk. Bus tours overrun this major des-
tination during the day, so try to get here before 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m.
during the summer to avoid the onslaught. You can partake of Japanese
tea and snacks in the teahouse for $2.95 per person. I think the garden is
worth the small admission fee, but you won’t be missing anything if you
pass on the tea and crackers.
See map p. 162. The garden entrance is to the left of the de Young Museum. 
% 415-752-4227. Admission: $3.50 adults, $1.25 seniors and children 6–12. Open: Daily
8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.
Lombard Street
Russian Hill (near North Beach)
Lombard Street — or, to be exact, the part of Lombard with the moniker
“crookedest street in the world” — begins at Hyde Street below Russian Hill.
This whimsical, flower-lined block attracts thousands of visitors each year.
If you intend to drive the red-brick street (it’s one-way, downhill, so take the
curves slowly), go early in the morning before everyone else revs up their
rentals. If you stop to take a picture from your car, you’ll be holding up traf-
fic and everyone will hate you. Instead, walk down the stairs to admire the
flowers, the houses with their long-suffering tenants, and the stellar view.
See map p. 162. Between Hyde and Leavenworth streets. Take the Powell-Hyde
cable-car line.
Museum of the African Diaspora
SoMa
If you walk down Third Street toward Yerba Buena Center, you can’t fail to
notice the multistory photo mosaic marking one of latest additions to the
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
176

South of Market culture klatch. MoAD packs quite a bit into its relatively
small exhibition space. It won’t take more than an hour to tour, but you’ll
find much to think about. Photographs, video, and some very cool inter-
active displays and technological touches focus on the themes of origins,
movement, adaptation, and transformation in relation to Africa — and
thus, in relation to our own selves and communities. Take the kids.
See map p. 162. 685 Mission St. at Third Street. % 415-358-7200. www.moadsf.org.
Take any Muni streetcar to the Montgomery Street Station or the 15-Third, 30-
Stockton, or 45-Union/Stockton bus. Admission: $10 adults, $5 seniors and students,
free for children under 13. Open Wed–Sat 11 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun noon to 5 p.m.
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art
SoMa
The handsome Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) houses an impressive col-
lection of 20th-century paintings, sculptures, and photographs. The beau-
tiful interior exudes a warmth that makes viewing the art even more
enjoyable. The exhibits, the excellent museum cafe, and the artfully
stocked museum store will keep you there for a good half-day.
See maps p. 162 and p. 178. 151 Third St., 2 blocks south of Market near Howard
Street. % 415-357-4000. www.sfmoma.org. Take any Muni streetcar to the
Montgomery Street Station or the 15-Third, 30-Stockton, or 45-Union/Stockton bus.
Admission: $13 adults, $8 seniors, and $7 students with ID; half-price Thurs 6–9 p.m.;
free for kids under 12; free to all first Tues of the month. Open: Thurs 11 a.m.–8:45
p.m., Fri–Tues 11 a.m.–5:45 p.m.; closed Wed and major holidays; open at 10 a.m.
during the summer.
Yerba Buena Gardens and Center for the Arts
SoMa
This 22-acre complex is a microdestination in a setting once known for
nothing but parking lots and derelicts. It includes a collection of galleries
showing a rotating exhibition of contemporary visual and performance art
by local artists, lovely gardens, a stage for dance troupes (including
ODC/San Francisco and Smuin Ballets/SF), and a film/video theater.
Interactive amusements include an ice-skating rink, a bowling alley, a chil-
dren’s garden and carousel, and an arts/technology studio for older kids.
An unrelated entertainment behemoth in a separate building across the
street — the Metreon — houses restaurants, shops, an IMAX theater,
games, and multiplex movie screens. If you take in all that Yerba Buena
Center has to offer, you can easily spend the entire day in this area. Parking
is expensive; use public transportation if possible.
East of the carousel you can find the enclosed, light-filled, Yerba Buena
Ice-Skating Rink and the 12-lane Bowling Center (% 415-820-3532; www.
skatebowl.com). Public skating session times vary, so phone before
trekking over. Admission is adults $8, seniors $5.50, and children under 13
$6.25. Skate rental is $3. The Bowling Center is open Sunday through
Thursday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., until midnight Friday and Saturday. Admission
for adults is $4 per game or $25 an hour; Sunday through Thursday night

and weekend afternoons it’s $5.50 per game or $30 an hour, and Friday and
Saturday night it’s $7 per game, $35 an hour.
Wednesday from 7:15 to 9:15 p.m. is free skate-rental night.
Zeum (% 415-820-3320; www.zeum.org) is a wonderful art/technology
center with hands-on labs that give visitors the opportunity to create ani-
mated video shorts with clay figures; learn about graphics, sound, and
video production in the second-floor studio; and interact with the gallery
exhibits. The center is rare in that it’s the only attraction specifically
designed for older kids and teens that delivers some intellectual stimula-
tion and doesn’t rely on video games. Even your standard-issue bored ado-
lescent would find it difficult not to succumb to a Zeum offering. It’s open
Tuesday through Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the summer; Wednesday to
Friday 1 to 5 p.m., weekends 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the school year.
Admission is $8 for adults, $7 for seniors and students, $6 for kids 3 to 18.
See map p. 178. 701 Mission St., between Third and Fourth streets. % 415-749-2228
or 415-978-ARTS (box office). www.yerbabuenagardens.com. Take a streetcar
to the Powell or Montgomery Street station, or take the 14-Mission or 15-Third bus,
among others.
The Metreon
SoMa
Noisy and lit like a Vegas casino, the Metreon is four stories of glass and
brushed metal, enclosing a handful of shops and cafe along with the inter-
active game arena, a favorite with the city’s teenagers and young adults.
On the third floor are 15 movie screens and the city’s first IMAX theater. A
West Coast outpost of New York’s Tavern on the Green is scheduled to
open on the fourth floor in late 2009.
See maps p. 162 and p. 178. Mission at Fourth Street. % 800-METREON. www.west
field.com/metreon. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–10 p.m.
Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
Just because you’ve visited the top sights doesn’t mean you’ve seen it
all. This section offers ideas on how to entertain children and teens, how
to get a taste of San Francisco history and more than a taste of art,
where to take your hiking shoes, where to grab a bike, and much more.
Especially for kids
San Francisco has enough family activities to exhaust even the most
energetic clan. Along with those I list in this section, consider an after-
noon at the ballpark (see “Especially for sports fans,” later in this chap-
ter), which has an exciting play area just for kids that’s open whether or
not the Giants are in town. The easy walk to Fort Point (see “Especially
for hikers,” later in this chapter) appeals to kids as well, because it takes
in the Golden Gate Bridge and incorporates a cool Civil War–era fort
they can explore.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 179

The best Web site for finding out what’s available for children is
GoCityKids (www.gocitykids.com). The well-maintained calendar 
of events mines what’s going on in and around the city.
The San Francisco Zoo, Sloat Boulevard and 45th Avenue (% 415-753-
7080; www.sfzoo.org), has been renovating like mad, ridding itself of
old-fashioned cages and exhibits, and embracing animal conservation.
You’ll find an African Savanna exhibit and Lemur Forest; an innovative,
noteworthy primate center; a historic merry-go-round; an expanded chil-
dren’s petting zoo; and — this is the clincher — a sizable children’s play-
ground near the Sloat Boulevard entrance. Stroll the more than 65 acres
to see the animals, and then park your tired body on a bench within
yelling distance and let the under-10 members of the family climb to
their heart’s content. Zoo admission is $11 for adults, $8 for seniors and
kids 12 to 15, $5 for kids 3 to 11, free for babes under 3, and free the first
Wednesday of each month. The zoo is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
To get there, take the L-Taraval Muni streetcar.
Another kid-pleaser, the Musée Mécanique, Pier 45 at the end of Taylor
Street (% 415-346-2000; www.museemecanique.org), contains a fantas-
tic collection of lovingly restored and maintained mechanical marvels
that were the forerunners of pinball machines. Among the treasures, you
can try your hand at World Series Baseball, have your fortune told, and
giggle wildly with Laughing Sal, all for a quarter a pop. The museum is
near PIER 39. Admission is free, but bring along a roll of quarters. The
museum is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday
and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. To get there, take the F-Market street-
car or the Powell-Mason cable car.
China Beach has picnic facilities and awe-inspiring views of the Golden
Gate Bridge. It’s also one of the few safe swimming beaches in town, but
the water is chilly, so designing sand castles and picnicking are better
activities. The 29-Sunset bus stops at 25th Avenue and El Camino del
Mar. From there, walk about 6 blocks north to the beach.
San Francisco has no shortage of parks and playgrounds in nearly every
neighborhood, but they do range in quality. In the Nob Hill/Russian Hill
area, Lafayette Park is appealing for its small but nicely equipped and
fenced-in playground, walking paths, and views. It’s on Clay Street
between Washington, Laguna, Gough, and Sacramento streets. Take the 
1-California or 12-Folsom-Pacific buses to get there. You have to make a
little effort to reach Mountain Lake Park, which is close to the Richmond
District side of the Presidio on Lake Street (between Eighth and 12th
avenues), but this is one of the best parks in town for the entire family.
The playground is two-tiered; the street-level half is for the under-6 set,
while the bottom half is fun even for young-at-heart teens. Hiking trails
and a small beach make this spot even more attractive. To get there, take
Muni bus 1AX, 1BX, or 28–19th Avenue.
Young Performers Theatre (YPT) at Fort Mason presents children’s
plays most weekend afternoons, starring members of the YPT acting

classes. The performances are most suitable for kids under 11. You can
find a schedule of events on the Web (www.ypt.org). Tickets are $7 for
kids and $10 for adults. Make reservations by phoning YPT at % 415-
346-5550. The theater is in Room 300, Building C, at Fort Mason. To get
there, take the 22-Fillmore, 30-Stockton, or 42-Downtown bus.
Especially for teens
The South of Market neighborhood works well as a teenage playground
encompassing Yerba Buena Gardens, the Metreon, and many places to
shop. From here, it’s a quick walk to Market Street, where you can catch
the N-Judah Muni streetcar to Haight-Ashbury. After your kids have seen
Haight Street, they’ve seen it all.
The Cartoon Art Museum, 655 Mission St., between Second and Third
streets (% 415-227-8666; www.cartoonart.org), takes the funny papers
seriously. Exhibits in the museum’s five galleries, a half-block from Yerba
Buena Gardens, trace the history of cartoon art from political jabs to

underground comics. Temporary shows highlight individual artists such
as Edward Gorey and forms such as television cartoon animation. The
museum shop has a sophisticated selection of books for enthusiasts.
Admission is $6 for adults, $4 for seniors and students, and $2 for chil-
dren 6 to 12. The first Tuesday of the month is “pay what you wish day.”
The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. To
get there, take any streetcar to the Montgomery Street station and walk a
block east to Mission Street.
San Francisco Centre, on the corner of Market and Fifth streets, is a
nine-story mall containing many familiar names beloved by teenage
girls, including a huge Nordstrom department store. Next door is a
357,740-square-foot Bloomingdale’s (and that’s a lot of hangers), the
anchor tenant at the humongous new Westfield Centre. Your young
shopper may be just as happy exploring the stores around Union Square
(see Chapter 12), and at least there you’ll get a little fresh air on your
way in and out of the revolving doors.
Teenagers adore the Metreon because the technology stores contain all
the latest widgets, some of which they can audition. When they tire of
gawking at stuff, the video games in the TILT arcade can occupy as many
minutes as you’ll allow or they can pay for. And after you’ve had enough,
you can coax them away from the flashing screens with promises of food
at one of the many cafes.
Zeum was designed for 8- to 18-year-olds and is staffed by savvy teens.
Even recalcitrant 15-year-olds can find something engaging to do here,
whether or not they admit it.
I saved the best for last; take your teen to Haight Street for some shopping
(and shock) therapy. The N-Judah streetcar deposits you a few blocks
south of Haight, and it beats parking. One of the best music stores in
town, Amoeba Records, is at 1855 Haight St. (% 415-831-1200). Both the
used and new clothing stores here — in particular Villains, 1672 Haight St.
(% 415-626-5939) — stock the coolest stuff around. I don’t mean to make
too much of the street scene, but youthful runaways and poseurs do con-
gregate in this neighborhood, and it can feel equally attractive, poignant,
and scary to adolescents. At the very least, you’ll have something interest-
ing to talk about on the ride back to your hotel.
Especially for history buffs
In this case, you’ll have to settle for fairly recent history, given that not 
a whole lot was happening around here until the Gold Rush. The next
major event was the 1906 earthquake.
One of the historic sites related to the earthquake that you can visit is at
the corner of Market and Kearny streets: Lotta’s Fountain (given to the
city in 1875 by popular entertainer Lotta Crabtree). This gold-painted
landmark served as a community bulletin board where people left notes
for missing family and friends after the disaster.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
182

To find out about San Francisco’s rise during the quest for gold, take 
the free Gold Rush City walking tour offered by City Guides on Sunday at
2 p.m. and Wednesday at 11 a.m. Meet by the Transamerica Pyramid at
Clay and Montgomery streets. The walk encompasses Jackson Square
(Jackson and Montgomery streets), a landmark admired for its many
restored Gold Rush–era brick warehouses. Call % 415-557-4266 for
details.
The Cable Car Museum explains everything you’d want to know about
our antique road warriors, through photographs, models, actual cable
cars, and a close-up look at the mechanisms that make them click. The
museum is inside the cable-car barn, 1201 Mason St., at Washington
Street (% 415-474-1887; www.cablecarmuseum.com). Admission is free,
and the museum is open daily, April through September 10 a.m. to 6
p.m., and October through March until 5 p.m. To get there, take the
Powell-Mason or Powell-Hyde cable-car lines.
Mission Dolores, 16th and Dolores streets (% 415-621-8203; www.
missiondolores.org), is a fine example of Mission architecture, and
the oldest building in the city. This is the sixth of the 21 missions
founded under the auspices of Franciscan missionary Junipero Serra
and built by Native Americans. Services were first held on the site a 
few days before the Declaration of Independence was signed. A $1 self-
guided audio tour takes 40 minutes. Admission is free, but donations are
gratefully accepted; the mission is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and
in the summer until 4:30 p.m. To get there, take the J-Church streetcar,
which stops 1 block east.
The Wells Fargo History Museum is at 420 Montgomery St., at California
Street (% 415-396-2619; www.wellsfargohistory.com/museums).
Wells Fargo opened one of its first offices on this site in 1852, ready to
handle business generated by the Gold Rush. Among the displays are
mining equipment, an antique stagecoach, and gold nuggets. Be sure to
try out the telegraph machine on the first floor, especially if you have
kids in tow. The museum is open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and
admission is free.
Especially for art lovers
The Legion of Honor, Lincoln Park between Clement Street and 34th
Avenue in the outer Richmond District (% 415-750-3600; www.famsf.
org), exhibits an impressive collection of paintings, drawings, decora-
tive art, and one of the world’s finest collections of Rodin sculptures,
including an original cast of The Thinker. The grounds around the
Palace of the Legion of Honor, as the building is known, are a draw as
well. Admission is $10 for adults, $7 for seniors over 65, $6 for children
13 to 17, and free for children under 13, and free on the first Tuesday of
the month. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 9:30 a.m.
to 5:15 p.m. To get there, take the 38-Geary bus to 33rd Avenue, and then
transfer to the 18–46th Avenue bus for a ride to the museum entrance.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 183

Union Square from Grant Avenue to Mason Street and Geary to Post
Street is home to a number of fine-arts dealers. Of note are the Art
Exchange Gallery (% 415-956-5750) and Toomey Tourell (% 415-
989-6444; www.toomey-tourell.com), both in the canvas-rich building
at 49 Geary St., at Grant Street, as well as the John Berggruen Gallery,
at 228 Grant St., between Sutter and Post (% 415-781-4629; www.
berggruen.com). The galleries close on Monday.
First Thursdays is a program sponsored by the San Francisco Art Dealers
Association to get people inside member galleries. They open on the first
Thursday of the month at 49 Geary St., serving wine and maybe a little
cheese from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. For a list of participating galleries, call 
% 415-921-1600.
Combine a walk along the Marina with a tour of the galleries at Fort
Mason Center (% 415-345-7575; www.fortmason.org). They include
the Museo ItaloAmericano and SFMoMA’s Artists Gallery, which dis-
plays original art for sale and for rent. The galleries are fairly small but
often have quirky exhibits. Wandering around Fort Mason is a good way
to round out your excursion. The Museo ItaloAmericano charges a
small admission fee, but the Artists Gallery is free. Open daily from 
8 a.m. to midnight. To get there, take the 30-Stockton, 47–Van Ness, or
28–19th Avenue bus, which run nearby.
Especially for architecture lovers
When you visit the Alamo Square Historic District, you may feel a touch
of déjà vu. It’s the subject of the famous photograph of the Victorian row
houses. The “painted ladies,” which front the San Francisco skyline, are
a magnet for photographers, probably on a daily basis. You’ll find this
historic block between Steiner, Scott, Hayes, and Grove streets, west of
the Civic Center. The 21-Hayes bus takes you right there from Market
and Hayes streets.
The Haas-Lilienthal House (% 415-441-3000; www.sfheritage.org),
an 1886 Queen Anne Victorian, is open to the public for one-hour tours
on Wednesday and some Saturdays from noon to 3 p.m. and Sunday
from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Located at 2007 Franklin St., at Jackson Street, 
this is the only local example of a home from this period that’s open to
the public. To get there by bus, take the 12-Folsom, the 27-Bryant, the
42–Downtown Loop, the 47–Van Ness, the 49–Van Ness/Mission, or the
83-Pacific. Admission is $8 for adults, $5 for seniors 65 and older and for
children under 12.
You may also want to check out the San Francisco Public Library, 100
Larkin St. (% 415-557-4400; http://sfpl.lib.ca.us), between Grove
and Fulton streets. Natural light streams in from a five-story atrium sky-
light and windows that encircle the stacks. If you have kids along,
browse the children’s section. The library even has — gasp! — a gift
shop. Take any Muni streetcar to the Civic Center station and walk a
block west on Grove Street.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
184

While you’re in the Civic Center neighborhood, drop by the refurbished
City Hall on Van Ness Avenue, between McAllister and Grove streets.
The 1915 building has never looked better. Not only did the structure get
a seismic retrofitting (de rigueur in this earthquake-prone town) and a
good cleaning, but the dome and ornamental balcony railings were
regilded, creating an impressive landmark and adding golden highlights
to the view. The rotunda is breathtakingly beautiful and worth going
through the metal detectors to view.
For more architectural wonders, check out the walking tours later in this
chapter.
Especially for bicyclists
If your reflexes are good and you have a reliable helmet, try touring San
Francisco from the seat of a two-wheeler. You can rent bikes and helmets
from quite a few locations around town.
For a ride in beautiful Golden Gate Park, stop by one of the nearby bike
stores, such as Avenue Cyclery, 756 Stanyan St. (% 415-387-3155; www.
avenuecyclery.com), or Wheel Fun at Stow Lake (% 415-668-6699),
inside the park. The Bike Hut at South Beach, on the Embarcadero at
Pier 40 (% 415-543-4335; www.thebikehut.com), is the place to find
high-quality bikes to pedal along the waterfront. It’s open Wednesday
through Sunday (unless it is raining) from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Rentals are a
mighty reasonable $5 an hour or $20 per day. And if you’re considering 
a bike trip across the Golden Gate Bridge, the nice guys at Blazing
Saddles (% 415-202-8888; www.blazingsaddles.com) — in North
Beach (1095 Columbus Ave.), at the Powell/Hyde cable car turnaround
(2715 Hyde St.), and at Fisherman’s Wharf (Piers 41 and 431⁄2) — will pro-
vide you with all the information and encouragement you need. The
equipment for kids and adults is shiny and well maintained. Rentals cost
$7 to $11 an hour or $28 to $68 a day and include helmets, locks, front
packs, rear racks, maps, and advice. Three-hour guided bike tours are
also available at $65 per person, including a return ticket on the ferry.
Pedaling across the Golden Gate Bridge into Sausalito, where you can
eat, look around the arty, touristy town, and then return by ferry, can be
good fun; in truth, you don’t really need a chaperone. The Blue & Gold
Fleet (% 415-705-8200; www.blueandgoldfleet.com) and Golden Gate
Ferry (% 415-923-2000; www.goldengateferry.org) depart the
Sausalito ferry dock at least half a dozen times a day. Call for a schedule.
One-way Blue & Gold Fleet fares are $9 for adults and $5 for children 5 to
11; one-way Golden Gate Ferry fares are $7.10 for adults, $3.55 for chil-
dren 6 to 18 (under 6 free), and $3.55 for seniors. The 9-mile ride to
Sausalito can be challenging, partly due to the windy conditions and
partly due to the other bicyclists you’re competing with for space.
For more information on biking in the area, contact the San Francisco
Bicycle Coalition (% 415-431-BIKE), or browse the Web site at www.
sfbike.org.

Especially for hikers
A surprisingly good amount of hiking opportunities await in the city, in
the Presidio, along the bay, through Golden Gate Park, and along the
Pacific Coast. Committed hikers should head to the Marin Headlands for
the best trails and views. Muni runs a bus (76–Marin Headlands) from
downtown to the Headlands parking lot on Sunday and holidays. Check
www.sfmta.com for a schedule and route information.
Angel Island, a federal and state wildlife refuge that is the largest of San
Francisco Bay’s three islets, is 8 miles from San Francisco and accessible
only by ferry (a 20-minute journey) or private boat. Plan to spend the
entire day on the island if you decide to go during the week — the ferry
departs San Francisco sometime after 10 a.m., and the only return trip
departs sometime after 3 p.m. (The schedule changes seasonally.) On
weekends, you have a choice of four return trips. You can bring a picnic
or get something at the small store and cafe that operate near the dock.
Check out the beautiful 12 miles of hiking trails, climb up Mt. Livermore

for yet another spectacular view of the Golden Gate Bridge, or take the
one-hour tram tour past the historic sites, including the former immigra-
tion station, which has undergone renovation and should be open for
tours by the time you read this. Mountain-bike rentals are also available
on Angel Island, but only during the spring and summer. Call Blue &
Gold Ferry (% 415-705-8200) for a current ferry schedule. Round-trip
fares are $15 for adults and $8.50 for children 6 to 12. For recorded infor-
mation about the island, call % 415-435-1915. Ferries leave from Pier 41
in Fisherman’s Wharf.
Crissy Field (% 415-561-7690 general information or 415-561-7752 for
weekend workshops and classes; www.crissyfield.org) is a national
park made up of 100 acres between the bay and the Presidio. The park
features a tidal marsh, sheltered picnic area, bike path, walking trail,
cafe, bookstore, and education center. It’s a beautiful spot; an easy, flat
walk; and wheelchair accessible. Begin with a visit to the Crissy Field
Center. Ask for an activity book for a self-guided walk, or join one of the
interpretive hikes offered most weekends. Stop at the Warming Hut at

the western end of the park by the fishing pier for a snack and some
inspired gift shopping. Foodies will be suitably impressed to discover
that the cafe menu was developed with input from Alice Waters, of Chez
Panisse fame. The 28–19th Avenue, 29-Sunset, and 43-Masonic buses
stop nearby.
Fort Point (% 415-556-1693), which dates from 1857, lies under the
Golden Gate Bridge at the tip of the peninsula. Along with Civil War–era
cannons, it boasts surfers who appear to be risking their lives much more
than the soldiers once stationed here did. From the Hyde Street Pier, take
the easy 31⁄2-mile stroll along the paved Golden Gate Promenade, which
hugs the coast as it passes through the Marina Green and Crissy Field. Or
take the 28–19th Avenue or 29-Sunset bus to the Golden Gate Bridge and
climb down from the viewing area to a short trail leading to the premises.
You can take a self-guided audio tour of the fort if you like, then back-
track to the Hyde Street cable-car turnaround, where you can hop on a
cable car to Union Square. Fort Point is usually open Friday through
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., but phone first to check.
If you’re a hiking novice or walking with kids, the Coastal Trail to the
Cliff House probably isn’t the hike for you. It’s rigorous and can be dan-
gerous. The trail head, a bit east of Fort Point, is well marked. Heading
south, the trail parallels the Pacific Ocean through the Presidio.
You can see small beaches below the trail on this hike, but if you’re
tempted to feel sand beneath your toes, follow the marked paths to get
there. Don’t climb over any rocky cliffs; the land here isn’t stable enough
to guarantee your safe return.
When you reach Baker Beach, about 11⁄2 miles from Fort Point, be pre-
pared for the nude sun worshippers, if there is any sun. As you continue
on the trail, you’ll pass the Lobos Creek Water Treatment Plant. From
there it’s a short way to El Camino Del Mar, a street leading through Sea
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco

A short history of Angel Island
Originally a Miwok Indian hunting and fishing ground, Angel Island was a harbor for
Spanish, British, and Mexican ships at various times beginning in 1775. Before the Civil
War, the U.S. government turned the island into a military base, remnants of which are
still visible. Between 1910 and 1940, Angel Island was a detention center mainly for
Asian immigrants, which earned it the nickname “Ellis Island of the West.” The immi-
gration station at China Cove is open for tours and provides a poignant glimpse into an
era when anti-Asian and anti-immigration policies placed hundreds of Chinese in
forced detention for weeks, months, and sometimes years. Poems carved into the
walls of the barracks by lonely, isolated detainees were rediscovered in 1970 and
inspired the ongoing preservation effort by the California legislature.

Cliff, a fancy residential neighborhood. At the end of El Camino Del Mar,
you’ll pick up the trail near the Lincoln Golf Course. If you continue
along this trail, with the land and the views rewarding your every step,
eventually you’ll arrive at the Cliff House, which has been serving
refreshments to visitors since 1863. It has one casual and one fancier
restaurant plus a bar, all with the views that keep tourists as well as
locals enthralled. Prices are high, so if you’re on a budget or prefer beer
to wine, keep walking down the Great Highway until you reach the Beach
Chalet restaurant and brewery (% 415-386-8439; www.beachchalet.
com). After lunch, you can return toward the Cliff House and catch the
38-Geary bus at La Playa and Balboa Street, or continue to Judah Street
and take an N-Judah streetcar downtown.
Named in honor of Sierra Club founder and conservationist John Muir,
553-acre Muir Woods in Marin County is what’s left locally of the red-
wood forests that once dominated the coast of Northern California.
Although not as sizable as Redwood National Forest farther north, these
old-growth redwoods are beautiful, and a range of trails suits hikers of
all levels. From the Golden Gate Bridge heading north toward Point
Reyes, take the Stinson Beach/Highway 1 exit west and follow the signs.
Parking is limited, so set out early in the day on weekends or go during
the week. Muir Woods Park is open from 8 a.m. until sunset. For addi-
tional information, call % 415-388-2595.
Especially for sports fans
The San Francisco Giants Major League Baseball team opened the fabu-
lous, 40,000-seat AT&T (formerly Pac Bell, formerly SBC) Park stadium
on the bay in April 2000. The ballpark is sweet — sightlines are clear, you
don’t freeze to death the way you did at Candlestick, the food is pretty
good, and home runs splash into the bay. Season-ticket holders hold the
best seats, but buying bleacher tickets to any but the most sought-after
games (Giants versus Dodgers contests, for example) shouldn’t be impos-
sible, because they’re sold only on game days. To purchase regular tick-
ets or tickets from season-ticket holders unable to make it to a particular
game, log on to the Web site (www.sfgiants.com) before you arrive, or
call % 877-473-4849 to charge tickets by phone. Transportation to the
ballpark is simple — take Muni to the Embarcadero Station and transfer
to the King Street extension. In or out of season, the stadium is open for
75-minute tours daily except game days at 10:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.
Admission is $10 adults, $8 seniors, and $6 kids under 13.
The San Francisco 49ers play at 3Com Park. Home games have been
sold out for years, but if you want to try your luck, the ticket office
number is % 415-656-4900. Scalpers sell tickets, which are often coun-
terfeits, outside the park. The best method of transport to the park is
Muni bus. The 9X–San Bruno Express bus leaves from Sutter Street near
Union Square; the 28X–19th Avenue bus runs along 19th Avenue; and the
47X–Van Ness cruises Van Ness Avenue.

You can also head across the bay to watch Oakland’s professional teams
play. For information on schedules and availability, and to order tickets,
visit the sites listed in the “Checking out sports on the Web” sidebar.
Getting seats to home games isn’t impossible, but you have to use some
creativity. A terrific source for last-minute concert and sports tickets (as
well as lots of other things) is the Web site www.craigslist.org. Craig
Newmark, an actual person who lives in San Francisco, created the Web
site in 1995, and it quickly became a community asset. Craigslist is now
nationwide, and it’s free to use.
Golfers have a great selection of public courses on which to play, includ-
ing gorgeous (and inexpensive) Lincoln Park (% 415-221-9911; www.
lincolnparkgc.com), Harding Park (% 415-664-4690; www.harding-
park.com), and the Presidio Golf Course (% 415-561-4661; www.
presidiogolf.com). The links in the Presidio opened to the public 
in 1995, although the 18-hole, par-72 course was originally built in 1895.
Both Harding Park and the Presidio have restaurants and pro shops, and
there’s a putting green at the Presidio.
Seeking Some Spiritual Pursuits
San Franciscans aren’t merely a hedonistic group of left-wing free-
thinkers, despite what you may have heard. As a matter of fact, most
pray on a daily basis. Sometimes they pray for a parking space, but
mostly they thank God that they live in San Francisco.
Arrive a half-hour early to claim a seat at the 9 a.m. Sunday services (an
hour early for the 11 a.m. services) at Glide Memorial United Methodist
Church, 330 Ellis St. (% 415-674-6000; www.glide.org). The Rev. Cecil
Williams, a genuinely great man, lets the multiethnic gospel choir do
most of the sermonizing, and they’re wildly effective. A cross-section of

Checking out sports on the Web
In addition to the following specific sites, where (in most cases) you can purchase tick-
ets online, swing by the Bay Area’s general sports site at www.bayinsider.com.

friendly San Franciscans packs the pews, clapping, singing, and celebrat-
ing. It’s church, it’s theater, and it’s amazing.
Grace Cathedral, the magnificent Episcopal Church at the top of Nob
Hill, 1100 California St., between Taylor and Jones streets (% 415-749-
6300; www.gracecathedral.org), has an outdoor stone terrazzo
labyrinth that may promote a meditative moment. It’s open to visitors
daily, anytime. You can rent a labyrinth audio tour, complete with walk-
ing music provided by the Grace Choir, at the gift shop.
Old First Presbyterian Church, 1751 Sacramento St., at Van Ness
Avenue (% 415-474-1608), sponsors a concert series leaning heavily
toward the classical that’s low cost and high quality. You can call for a
list of upcoming events or check the Internet (www.oldfirstconcerts.
org). Getting from downtown to the church is a snap on the California
Street cable-car line.
Completed in 1970, St. Mary’s Cathedral, 1111 Gough St., between Ellis
and Geary (% 415-567-2020; www.stmarycathedralsf.org), is worth 
a look for its modern architecture and soaring interior space. Inside, be
sure to lift your eyes toward heaven to admire the cross-shaped skylight.
Going for Garden and Park Respites
San Franciscans cherish the city’s open spaces. If you know where to
look, you’ll find little parks and secret gardens in some unlikely places.
At the end of Market Street in the Embarcadero, two simple gardens
grace the seventh floor of One Market Plaza. Elevators to the gardens
are in the Spear and Steuart Street lobbies. Upon exiting, walk toward
the bay; you’ll find two patios surrounded by well-tended expanses of
lawn and flowers overlooking a classic bay view.
If you’ve stopped by City View on Commercial St. (between Montgomery
and Kearny streets) for a dim sum lunch (see Chapter 10), you’ll be steps
away from a tiny pocket park maintained by the 505 Montgomery build-
ing landlord. The benches and tables at Empire Park often fill with
people taking a breather from the office.
At Rincon Center (corner of Mission and Steuart sts.) you’ll find a court-
yard garden with benches sitting among a generous array of ornamental
hedges, azaleas, and seasonal plantings. You can get a snack inside and
enjoy it in the garden. A few blocks away, at 100 First St., you’ll find the
award-winning second-floor garden in the Delta Tower, which is a lush
respite from the madness of the Transbay Terminal and Mission Street.
The black granite and green glass fountain sculpture provide a soothing
counterpoint to the street traffic. Yerba Buena Gardens features willow
trees, a sweep of bright-green lawn, and a variety of blossoms. Behind
the gardens’ 22-foot waterfall is a memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr.,
featuring a series of glass panels etched with quotations from his
speeches and writings.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 191

Levi’s Plaza, between the Embarcadero and Sansome Street, consists of
the company’s multiple buildings and two plazas separated by Battery
Street. The centerpiece of the hard plaza is a fountain you can walk
through on paving stones — a big favorite with kids. The soft plaza
across the street is really a park with fir trees and grass. The company
displays letters and products in a visitor center at 1155 Battery St., open
weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Cross the plaza to Sansome Street and look for the bottom of the Filbert
Steps, a steep staircase that rises to Montgomery and Filbert streets.
Around the midpoint of the stairway, you’ll find a sight so profoundly
San Francisco that you’ll immediately understand what all the fuss is
about. This is the Grace Marchand Garden; its roses and ferns add a
wild elegance to the hillside. The residents don’t like the tourists who
clog the steps, especially on weekends, but that’s the price they have to
pay for living next to a minor landmark. In any case, this is a garden to
admire from outside the wooden fence only.
Seeing San Francisco by Guided Tour
I used to feel self-conscious about taking a guided tour in a new city.
Many travelers, myself included, shy away from the idea of being herded
on and off large buses like curious sheep. But I’ve finally embraced my
inner tourist and learned to appreciate organized outings. Actually,
guided tours are a sensible way to get your bearings in an unfamiliar
place. You may not have much time to explore on your own and may
want to catch the major sights in one day. Or perhaps you have difficulty
getting around, or you don’t want to drive. Maybe you need an overview
to find out what interests you in San Francisco, or you’re traveling alone
and want some company.
Fortunately, you can find almost as many varieties of guided tours as
there are varieties of people in San Francisco. Not all of them have you
peering out a dirty bus window at some landmark while straining to hear
the muffled voice of your guide over the microphone (or, worse, an out-
of-date tape). In San Francisco, guided tours happen on foot and ferry-
boats as well as on buses and even zebra-striped Land Rovers. They
cover special interests as well as the major sights. If you think a tour
listed in this chapter is for you, visit the Web site, call the company or
individual guide for a brochure, or ask your hotel to send you informa-
tion. Most tours require advance reservations.
Hotels generally have preferred companies that they recommend for bus
tours. The hotel often gets a small kickback for every reservation, so it
may not have your best interests in mind. If you favor one tour company
over another, book it yourself or request that company specifically when
you speak to the concierge. Don’t leave the decision up to the hotel.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco

The bus stops here: Touring on wheels
If you want to be sure you at least catch a glimpse of San Francisco’s
major attractions, orientation tours may be just the ticket. Some tour
operators spiff up the menu with motorized cable cars or double-decker
buses, whereas other companies use lower-profile minibuses that appeal
to visitors who don’t want to stand out in a crowd.
Be advised that not all trips are narrated by the bus driver; some just
have recorded commentary. I don’t recommend these audio tours. The
sound quality is miserable, and some of the information is outdated,
such as the part about the prices of the houses you pass on the tour. Be
sure to ask whether the commentary is recorded or live before you book
your tour.
Gray Line Tours (% 415-434-8687; www.sanfranciscosightseeing.
com), the big kahuna of the tour industry, schedules a number of orienta-
tion tours around the city and beyond in red double-decker buses,
motorized cable cars, and smaller vans. The deluxe 31⁄2-hour city tour
(tickets: $44 for adults, $42 seniors, $22 for children 5–11) hits the high-
lights — Twin Peaks, Mission Dolores, the Cliff House, Golden Gate Park,
the Golden Gate Bridge — and there’s an option to tack on a bay cruise.
Tower Tours (% 415-345-8687; www.towertours.net) is popular 
with many San Franciscans with visiting relatives because the company
uses sleek minibuses that carry only about two dozen people. Tower’s
31⁄2-hour city tour stops at the same sites as Gray Line’s buses. The cost
is $47 for adults, $45 seniors, and $26 for children 5 to 11.
Fire Engine Tours (% 415-333-7077; www.fireenginetours.com) are
not for people who want to avoid attention, but go ahead and suspend
your dignity for an hour and 15 minutes while heading for a ride across
the Golden Gate Bridge. Tour guide Marilyn Katzman, a tap dancer and
former child actress, quits talking, singing, and leading cheers only when
required by law. As the shiny 1955 Mack Fire Truck drives past various
sights — the Octagon House, the Presidio Pet Cemetery, Union Street —
Marilyn tosses out historical facts and figures mostly relating to fires
and the nice folks who put them out. Although this tour doesn’t include
a good part of the city, you will see the famous skyline from a vantage
point across the bridge and have an extremely fun time. Pick up the tour
outside the Cannery on Beach Street. Tickets are $45 for adults, $35 for
teens 13 to 17, and $25 for kids under 13. Reservations are advised.
Tours run Wednesday through Monday at 1 p.m., unless it rains. Phone
for a schedule.
The Urban Safari (% 415-282-5555 or 1-866-MYSAFARI; www.theurban
safari.com), under the guidance of überguide and Land Rover afi-
cionado Daniel Oppenheim, can mimic a somewhat conventional city
tour or completely devolve into a freewheeling, wacky adventure.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 193

Basically, Bwana Daniel is up for anything, and he’ll mine every ounce of
his imagination to design a minimum four-hour outing to your specifica-
tions, exact or inexact. Throw him a theme and he’ll come back with a
plan, or choose from a menu of ideas on his Web site. Pith helmets,
animal crackers, and leopard-print fleece blankets provide additional
ambience. Prices, which include a meal, lots of extras, and hotel pickup,
are $100 per person for groups of four and $75 for each additional
person in the same group.
Doing it yourself (and saving money) on Muni
Stopping at every other corner and having a driver who doesn’t give
much, if any, commentary may not seem like the ideal let’s-get-to-know-
the-city excursion. But a do-it-yourself tour by Muni bus has its advan-
tages. The outing will cost you only a few dollars and no more than three
transit hours. This approach lets you come and go at your leisure — if
you decide 25 minutes at Golden Gate Park isn’t enough, who cares if the
bus leaves? You can always catch the next one. These “orientation” tours
are not for anyone who requires a great deal of comfort, however — city
buses are, after all, creaky and well worn.
Ask for a free transfer when you board the bus. With the transfer, you
can disembark whenever you like and catch another bus or a Muni
streetcar at no additional charge (within 90 minutes). Transfers are not
valid on cable cars, however.
Muni tour #1: Painted ladies and Pacific Heights
Here’s a tour that introduces you the famous Victorians on Alamo
Square, Japantown, Fillmore Street shopping in Pacific Heights, the
Marina, and Chinatown. Board the 21-Hayes bus at Market and Powell
streets (and remember to ask for a transfer). Exit on Steiner Street, at
one side of Alamo Square. When you’ve gotten your fill of the painted
ladies, walk a block east to Fillmore Street and look for the 22-Fillmore.
That bus runs toward the bay through Japantown and continues up
toward Pacific Heights. All kinds of shops line Fillmore Street, and they
become swankier as you pass California Street. The bus eventually
crosses Union Street and ambles through the Marina District. Exit as
close as possible to Chestnut Street, where you can catch the 30-
Stockton. See the following tour for a description of a ride on this bus
back to Union Square. If you don’t stop for breaks (which sort of defeats
the purpose), expect to spend two hours on this route.
Muni tour #2: Traveling on the west side
Another do-it-yourself tour takes you around the western perimeter of
the city. From any downtown Muni station (Powell Street is closest to
Union Square), catch the L-Taraval or N-Judah streetcar, each of which
travels through some well-kept residential neighborhoods. Get off at
Sunset Boulevard in the outer Sunset District. On Sunset Boulevard, at
Taraval Street or Judah Street, depending on which streetcar you rode,
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
194

pick up a 29-Sunset bus going to the Presidio (not to California and 25th
Avenue, which doesn’t enter the former military base). The spectacular
views on this part of the ride include the Pacific Ocean and the Golden
Gate Bridge. In fact, the bus stops by a viewing area where you can get
off the bus and walk across the bridge and back if that’s on your to-do
list. The ride also includes a look at a pet cemetery inside the Presidio.
The 29-Sunset terminates at the transit center in the Presidio, but you
can then catch the 43-Masonic bus nearby. It takes you down Lombard
Street and over to Chestnut Street in the Marina district. From there, the
30-Stockton meanders along Chestnut over to Van Ness Avenue, and
then travels down Van Ness to North Point Street, close to Aquatic Park
and Ghirardelli Square. The route then goes through North Beach and
Chinatown, then back to Union Square. Alternatively, you can walk 
to PIER 39 and catch the F-Market streetcar for a ride down the
Embarcadero and up Market Street. Allow three hours without breaks.
Tooling around town
The latest and greatest DIY driving tour comes in the form of three-
wheel, two-passenger Trigger Scooter cars fitted with global positioning
systems and a 45-minute audio component that doubles as a tour guide.
The bright yellow theme park escapees are a hoot to drive but are
strictly for use in the city — for safety reasons, you can’t take them over
the bridges. Rent a Trigger through GoCar Rentals (% 800-914-6227 or
415-441-5695; www.gocartours.com) for $49 the first hour, $39 for the
second, and $29 an hour after that up to five hours, with a maximum
daily charge of $175. The company has two locations (you can pick up
and drop off at either): 321 Mason St., at O’Farrell Street, near Union
Square (open: 9 a.m.–6 p.m. daily), and 2715 Hyde St., at Beach Street,
near the cable-car turnaround (open: 8 a.m. to dusk daily). If you have a
youngster along for the ride, I guarantee he or she will be talking about it
for years to come.
Two if by sea: Touring by boat
Boat cruises provide a view of the city from an unusual vantage point
and are the only way to experience the bay in all its glory. You have
quite a few options for riding the waves, one of which is the commuter
ferries. Ferries pick up passengers from Fisherman’s Wharf (Piers 41 
and 431⁄2) and the Ferry Building.
The Blue & Gold Fleet (% 415-705-5555; www.blueandgoldfleet.com)
operates ferries to and from Marin County. This is also the only com-
pany that will take you to Alcatraz Island. Blue & Gold’s one-hour bay
cruise (tickets: $22 for adults, $18 for seniors and kids 12–18, $14 for
kids 5–11) sails under the Golden Gate Bridge; past Sausalito, Angel
Island, and Alcatraz; and then back to Fisherman’s Wharf. This tour will
be a satisfying, if brief, encounter with the bay. Check the Web site for
discounts on tickets.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 195

Red and White Fleet (% 415-673-2900; www.redandwhite.com) offers
an identical bay cruise with the added option of an open-air double-
decker bus tour around the city. The one-hour cruise alone is $22 for
adults and $16 for youths 5 to 17; with the bus, it’s $44 adults and $28
youths.
You want something a little more exciting than a ferry? Try sailing on
The Ruby (% 415-861-2165; www.rubysailing.com). This 60-foot steel
sloop, which holds about 30 passengers, skims the whitecaps in the bay
daily on a lunch cruise from 12:30 to 3 p.m. and an early-evening sail
with hors d’oeuvres from 6 to 8:30 p.m. The cost is $40 per person
(including food); beer and wine are available at an additional cost. Kids
under 10 are $20. Reservations are necessary. The Ruby docks by the
ramp at the foot of Mariposa Street at Third Street. The 22-Fillmore or
15-Kearny bus drops you off a block away.
Hornblower Dining Yachts (% 888-467-6256; www.hornblower.com)
let you sup as you sail on dinner and weekend brunch cruises around
the bay. Cruises last from one-and-a-half hours for brunch to three hours
for the nightly dinner/dance. The food is hotel-like, but this is a festive
way to dine — surrounded by superb views. Dinner rates per person are
$94 Sunday and Tuesday through Thursday, $104 Friday, and $114
Saturday. Weekend brunch cruises cost $72. Kids are half-price.
Reservations are required.
The bright yellow amphibious vehicles you may see bouncing around
bayside neighborhoods belong to Bay Quackers San Francisco Duck
Tours (% 415-431-3825; www.bayquackers.com). The 80-minute tours
leave every two hours beginning at 10 a.m. from the Anchorage Mall at
Fisherman’s Wharf and end up in the bay motoring around McCovey
Cove. If you time it right, you could enjoy an unusual view of a Giants
baseball game. It’s most definitely an entertaining ride, and the water
portion lasts just long enough to see the views but not get bored.
Tickets are $35 adults, $32 seniors and students, and $25 kids 3 to 12;
$100 buys a family ticket for two adults and two children.
Taking a walk on the wild side: Walking tours
Friends of the Library sponsor City Guides walking tours (% 415-557-
4266; www.sfcityguides.org). You may choose from 26 different
tours, all free! All you have to do is pick the tour that interests you and
show up at the proper corner on time. You can get an insider’s view 
of Chinatown, admire beautifully restored Victorian homes on the
Landmark Victorians of Alamo Square tour, or explore the haunts of the
original forty-niners on the Gold Rush City walk. “Rising Steel: Two
Centuries of San Francisco Architecture” takes place on two Sundays
each month; given the amount of construction going on, it’s a great walk
for anyone fascinated with urban buildings. Tours run about two hours
on average. Highly recommended!
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
196

The Victorian Home Walk (% 415-252-9485; www.victorianwalk.com)
combines a bus excursion with a walking tour through a number of cele-
brated neighborhoods. During the 21⁄2-hour tour, you see an array of
houses in areas that prohibit tour vans from entering. The guide prom-
ises the walk isn’t strenuous. The cost is $20. Tours leave daily from
Union Square at the corner of Powell and Post streets.
San Francisco Architectural Heritage conducts a Pacific Heights walk
(% 415-441-3000 for reservations; www.sfheritage.org) on Sunday at
12:30 p.m., beginning at the Haas-Lilienthal house. The two-hour tour
through the swanky neighborhood costs just $8 for adults and $5 for
seniors and children under 12.
HobNob Tours (% 866-851-1123; www.hobnobtours.com) gives you the
lowdown on Nob Hill while pointing out the highlights of one of the city’s
more significant ’hoods. Sure, the gossip and scandal provided are on
the historic side, but it’s still fascinating. The two-hour tours begin in the
Fairmont Hotel lobby weekdays at 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. and cost $30 per
person.
Eating your way through San Francisco
Shirley Fong-Torres, a local writer and personality, has been operating
Chinatown food tours for over 20 years. The 31⁄2-hour walk manages to
demystify the exotic rather irreverently. It includes running commentary
about the history of this fascinating neighborhood and stops at an
artist’s studio, a one-room temple, a market, an herbal shop, and a tea
company, where you’re treated to a tasting. Shirley’s company, Wok 
Wiz Chinatown Walking Tours & Cooking Center, 654 Commercial St.,
between Kearny and Montgomery streets (% 415-981-8989; www.
wokwiz.com), schedules the tours daily at 10 a.m. The cost — $40 for
adults, $35 for kids under 11 — includes dim sum lunch.
North Beach is the other popular neighborhood for food walks, and guide
Tom Medin (% 415-665-0480 or 888-358-8687; www.sffoodtour.com)
shows it off on his Local Tastes of the City tour. Tom’s on a personal mis-
sion to elevate your taste buds, and he figures the best way to do that is
by introducing you to the neighborhood’s butchers, bakers, and cof-
feemakers. First stop is Caffe Roma for a perfect cappuccino or espresso,
and then it’s one bakery/chocolate shop/delicatessen after another. Bring
a doggy bag. The three-hour tour — all easy walking —starts daily at 10
a.m. and 1 p.m. The cost is $59 adults, $39 youths 12 to 18, and $15 kids 
8 to 11.
There’s lots more to chocolate than milk and dark, so if you’re curious
about the history as well as the myriad flavors produced and sold
around town, all will be revealed on Andrea Nadel’s Gourmet Walks
(% 800-979-3370; www.gourmetwalks.com). The three-hour tour begins
at the Ferry Building. You’ll be sampling yourself silly from there to
Union Square. Tickets are $48 and for sale online or by phone. Tours run
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 197

Wednesday through Saturday. On Sunday at 2 p.m., for $72 per person,
the tour includes stops at a few wine bars that pair vino with chocolate.
Naps not included.
Seeking out special-interest tours
Learn all there is to know about gay and lesbian history from the Gold
Rush to the present day while Cruisin’ the Castro (% 415-255-1821;
www.cruisinthecastro.com). Tours meet at the rainbow flag on the
corner of Market and Castro streets, Tuesday through Saturday at 
10 a.m. Reservations are necessary. The cost for the two-hour walk is
$35 adults and $25 kids 3 to 12.
The Precita Eyes Mural Arts Center, 2981 24th St., near Harrison Street
(% 415-285-2287; www.precitaeyes.org), a not-for-profit arts center,
features more than 70 murals (including the very colorful Balmy Alley)
on the Mission District walking tours it sponsors. The 6-block walk
departs Saturday and Sunday at 1:30 p.m. from the center. The cost is
$12 for adults, $8 college students with ID, $5 for seniors and youths 12
to 17, and $2 for children under 12. A slightly shorter walk leaves from
Café Venice, 3325 24th St., near the 24th Street BART station, on
Saturday at 11 a.m.
Someday, no one’s gonna care where Janis Joplin or members of the
Grateful Dead crashed back in the day, but while you still have your
memories (or memory, as the case may be) check it out on the Haight-
Ashbury Flower Power Walking Tour (% 415-863-1621; for tickets call
800-979-3370; www.haightashburytour.com). The two-hour walk — 
a combination of hippy lore and Victorian appreciation — begins at 
9:30 a.m. on Tuesday and Saturday, 2 p.m. on Thursday, and at 11 a.m.
on Friday for a mere $20 per walker. If you have your own group of at
least four, you can inquire about alternate days and times.
An easy way to explore the redwood groves of Muir Woods (see
“Especially for hikers,” earlier in this chapter) is with Sierra Club guide
Tom Martell of Tom’s Scenic Trail Walking (% 415-381-5106). He’ll pick
you up (and drop you off) at your hotel, provide a picnic lunch, and
drive up to six adventurers to the lovely redwoods just beyond the
Golden Gate Bridge for a 2- to 4-mile hike. Cost for the 31⁄2-hour walk with
lunch is $50.

Shopping the Local Stores
In This Chapter
 Locating San Francisco’s big-name shops and specialty boutiques
 Discovering the main shopping neighborhoods
 Hunting down bargains
A
lthough most people think of Union Square as the hub of San
Francisco shopping — and for good reasons — the downtown area
has plenty of competition. Nearly every San Francisco neighborhood
boasts a thriving “Main Street” of locally owned boutiques, cafes, and
bookstores. You can find unique arts and crafts, clothing stores that
eschew chain-mentality fashion, independent booksellers, even house-
wares havens that reflect the style of the local clientele. Shopping in San
Francisco is never mundane. Depending on where you head, you can try
on a different attitude as easily as a different outfit.
Surveying the Scene
If you know where to look, you can do some very interesting shopping
around here. Oh, plenty of people complain about the city being
Starbucked and Gapped to death, but they aren’t looking beyond the
obvious retail centers. Not all the entrepreneurs in San Francisco are
franchisees or part of some conglomerate — some are actually opening
boutiques with a personal stamp. In particular, check out Valencia Street
for postmodern street wear and décor; Hayes Street for shoes, clothing,
and mod furnishings; Sacramento Street for contemporary clothing,
antiques, and kids’ clothes and furnishings; upper Grant Street for local
designers; upper Polk Street for home furnishing and decoration design
trends; and Haight Street for vintage, mod, and skateboarding gear.
You’ll find that stores are generally open Monday through Saturday from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m., even on many holi-
days. Shops around Fisherman’s Wharf tend to stay open later, as do
most department stores.
Sales tax in San Francisco is 8.5 percent, added at the cash register. You
don’t have to pay the sales tax if the store ships something out of state
for you, but shipping can cost as much as or more than the tax, unless
you’re purchasing a very expensive item.

The worldwide chain-store invasion, unfortunately, has not passed by
San Francisco. In fact, we accept the blame for the Gap frenzy — the
headquarters is near the Embarcadero — and if you see a Pottery Barn
or a Gymboree in your midst, well, those companies originated in the
Bay Area as well. But you can find plenty of unique emporiums that will
bring some excitement to the chase. Here’s a short list of great places.
Checking Out the Big Names
Gump’s, in Union Square at 135 Post St., between Kearny Street and
Grant Avenue (% 415-982-1616; www.gumps.com), is famous for its
Asian antiques, silver, and china, as well as for longevity — it’s been in
business since 1861. Anyone who receives a gift from Gump’s will shower
impressed thanks on the giver because of the name itself. It’s open
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m.
Looking for the perfect place for one-stop shopping? Then head over to
Macy’s West on Union Square, at Stockton and O’Farrell streets (% 415-
954-6271). At 700,000 square feet, this eight-story glass-fronted fashion
behemoth is bigger than some towns. It’s open Monday through Thurs-
day and Saturday 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday until 7 p.m., and Sunday from
11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
The Original Levi’s Store, 300 Post St. (% 415-501-0100; www.levis
store.com), is a showcase for more than 501s — you’ll see some wild
designs stitched onto jackets and jeans. One corner of this three-story
monument to denim is dedicated to alterations, in case your shrink-to-
fits still need a nip or tuck. It’s open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to
8 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
The brandalicious Apple Store on the corner of Stockton and Ellis
streets (% 415-392-0202; www.apple.com/retail/sanfrancisco)
schedules a roster of workshops for current and future Mac users and
has Internet access on the premises. Between this place, the Virgin
Megastore across the street, and Niketown a few blocks north on Post
Street, you could lose your average teen for a few hours. It’s open
Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 
7 p.m. A second, less frenetic branch is at 2125 Chestnut St. (% 415-848-
4445).
Bell’occhio, 10 Brady Street, off Market Street between 12th and Gough
streets (% 415-864-4048; www.bellocchio.com), has long been a
favorite with decorators, wedding planners, and sophisticated shoppers
searching for elusive bits of European flavor. Hidden in an alley off Market
Street, this bewitching little shop stocks cunning decorations, French rib-
bons, Mariage Frères tea, imported face powder, and odd finds the owner
discovers on her travels. To get there, take the F-Market streetcar to Civic
Center. It’s open Tuesday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
202

Polanco, a bright gallery featuring crafts and artwork from Mexico, is at
393 Hayes St. (% 415-252-5753; www.polanco.ypguides.net). This
block in Hayes Valley also has a few terrific clothing and home-décor
shops, so if you’re in the neighborhood, it’s worth a side trip. The
gallery is open Tuesday through Saturday 11:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and
Sunday 1 to 6 p.m.
Dandelion, 55 Potrero Ave., at Alameda (% 415-436-9500; www.
dandelionsf.com), isn’t a store you’ll find by accident. To reach its out-
of-the-way location close to the Design Center, south of Market Street,
you have to have heard about this place from a devoted customer. The
owners seem to be magnets for beautiful objects. Their prices are very
fair, their taste impeccable. The 9–San Bruno bus from Market and Ninth
streets can take you right here. It’s open Tuesday through Saturday 
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Famed San Francisco Chronicle journalist Herb Caen’s
columns often mentioned his favorite clothing store, Wilkes Bashford,
375 Sutter St., between Stockton Street and Grant Avenue, near Union
Square (% 415-986-4380; www.wilkesbashford.com). San Francisco’s
natty former mayor, Willie Brown, purchases his Brioni suits here. The
store sells sophisticated clothing for women as well. It’s open Monday
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Thursday to 8 p.m.
For CDs, vinyl (remember that?), and an in-depth selection of previously
owned music, head to the cognoscenti shop at Amoeba Records, 1855
Haight St. (% 415-831-1200; www.amoeba.com), in the musically famous
neighborhood of the same name. Open Monday through Saturday from
10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.
When those cognoscenti stroll down Haight Street, they often wear
really cool clothes from Rolo, a locally grown retailer with three loca-
tions around town. The flagship store, which carries street wear for men
and women, is south of Market at 1235 Howard St. (% 415-431-4545;
www.rolo.com). It’s open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 
8 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Market Street continues its upward trajectory (at least from Fifth Street
toward the Bay) with the opening of the humungous Bloomingdale’s,
centerpiece of the new Westfield San Francisco Centre next to the older
one (where Nordstrom is located) on Fifth and Market streets. Along with
all the usual suspects one expects to find in an upscale mall, this one also
has a day spa on the fifth floor, a gourmet grocer in the basement, movie
theaters, and dining establishments with good pedigrees, including Out
the Door, the takeout operation of the Slanted Door (see Chapter 10).
Going to Market
Farmers market aficionados will find Saturday at the Ferry Building at
the foot of Market Street more than satisfying. The majority of producers
bring organically grown foodstuffs to the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market
(see Chapter 10), and you’ll discover unusual varieties of fruits and 
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 203

vegetables, including heirloom tomatoes in season. The perfume of the
salt air, aroma of ripe fruit, and whiff of lavender wafting past your nos-
trils are deeply pleasurable; combined with the bay views, a busker play-
ing standards on his saxophone, and a plethora of tastes, the scene is
magical. Inside the building, permanent shops, most of which are open
seven days a week, stock everything you’d need for a feast plus all kinds
of tempting items, including books, chocolates, olive oil, kitchen necessi-
ties, wine, and imported packaged foods. If you find yourself hungry, 
the Slanted Door (see Chapter 10) is here, or you can sit down at the
MarketBar (% 415-434-1100; www.marketbar.com) on the east end,
visit Taylor’s Refreshers (see Chapter 10) for fast food I heartily
approve of, or attempt to get a counter seat at the excellent Hog Island
Oyster Bar (see Chapter 10). For a break, relax at the Imperial Tea
Court (see Chapter 10), where you can try exotic leaves and get a lesson
in the art of tea.
Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
Looking for that perfect little doodad for Aunt Hermione? Or do you just
like to browse and see what catches your fancy? Following is a rundown
of the city’s best shopping areas, with a few highlights in each. Happy
hunting!
Union Square
You’re never far from a department store in this neighborhood. From
one spot in the middle of Union Square, you can see Neiman Marcus
(% 415-362-3900; www.neimanmarcus.com), on Stockton and Geary
streets (open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–7 p.m. [until 8 p.m. Thurs] and Sun noon
to 6 p.m.), and Saks Fifth Avenue (% 415-986-4300; www.saksfifth
avenue.com), on the corner of Powell and Post streets (open: Mon–Sat
10 a.m.–7 p.m. [until 8 p.m. Thurs] and Sun 11 a.m.–6 p.m.). Then there’s
the Original Levi’s Store (see “Checking Out the Big Names”) on Post
and Stockton, a new candy-box-like Barney’s on the corner of Stockton
and O’Farrell streets (% 415-268-3500; open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–7 p.m.,
Sun 11 a.m.–6 p.m.) and Macy’s (see “Checking Out the Big Names”)
everywhere else. Ah . . . shopping!
A half-block north of Neiman’s on Stockton Street is designer-shop-lined
Maiden Lane. There’s also a back entrance to Britex Fabrics (% 415-
392-2910; www.britexfabrics.com), probably the best-stocked notions
and fabric store in the country (open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m.). The
front door is at 146 Geary St.
Parallel to Stockton eastward is Grant Street. One of the stores here is
also one of my favorites in the world: Anne Fontaine, 118 Grant St. 
(% 415-677-0911; www.annefontaine.com; open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–
6 p.m.; Sun noon to 5 p.m.). If you appreciate gorgeously made and 
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
204

tailored white blouses (plus a few other nonwhite must-haves), you’ll be
one wide-eyed consumer. Walk another block east and 2 blocks north
and watch for tiny Belden Place (www.belden-place.com), between
Bush and Pine streets (see Chapter 10). Delicious little restaurants line
the alley, and any one of them makes a satisfying place to stop for a
meal. At lunchtime on fair days, Belden, which is closed to auto traffic,
fills with cafe tables, giving the street a partylike atmosphere.
Chinatown
Chinatown is known for amusing trinkets and inexpensive clothing. But
most of the souvenirs sold in the shops that line Grant Avenue are not
the must-haves you come to San Francisco seeking. If you venture off
Grant Avenue, however, shop to your heart’s content in Chinese herbal
shops with strange remedies and unique jewelry stores full of jade of
varying quality. The merchants in the less touristy stores don’t always
speak English, and they may seem less than friendly, but don’t let that
stop you from looking around.
Be careful when shopping for jewelry in Chinatown, especially on Grant
Street. A relative of mine, who is a pretty savvy buyer, thought she was
purchasing some aquamarine earrings that turned out to be glass. Get a
second opinion if possible before plunking down serious money.
The “going-out-of-business” signs you see taped to the windows of sev-
eral Chinatown stores are nearly as old as the grandmothers walking
about with babies tied to their backs. These stores have been running
their farewell sales for years. Don’t expect any bargains.
If you can’t tear yourself away from Grant Avenue, the best place to 
find inexpensive (or expensive) gifts and housewares is Chong Imports,
838 Grant Ave., in the Empress of China building between Clay and
Washington streets (% 415-982-1432; www.chongimports.com). This
basement-level treasure house stocks a little of everything. It’s open
daily from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
At the Clarion Music Center, 816 Sacramento St., near Grant Avenue 
(% 415-391-1317; www.clarionmusic.com), check out the amazing
instruments, including traditional Chinese instruments like moon-
shaped guitars, plus Chinese lion dance masks. It’s open Monday
through Friday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Call for a Friday night world concert series schedule.
Tai Yick Trading Company, 1400 Powell St., at Broadway (% 415-986-
0961; www.taiyick.com), sells teapots, dishes, lamps, porcelain and
pottery vases, and statues at reasonable prices. The owners are helpful
and friendly, and native San Franciscans swear that this is the best store
of its kind in town. It’s open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 205

Legend has it that fortune cookies were invented at the Japanese Tea
Garden in Golden Gate Park. If you want to watch the production process,
head to the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Company in Chinatown (see
Chapter 11). The cookies make wonderful gifts to take back home. The
factory is at 956 Ross Alley, between Jackson and Washington streets
near Grant Avenue. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Haight Street
The scruffiness of this area bothered me when I lived nearby in the early
’80s, but I’ve changed, and so has the neighborhood. Clothing is the big
draw for shoppers, whether vintage or cutting edge, and you’ll see
apparel and shoes for all ages and stages. In particular, look for Behind
the Post Office, 1510 Haight St. (% 415-861-2507), for accessories from
local designers; Kids Only, 1608 Haight St. (% 415-552-5445), for your
flower child; Ambiance, 1458 Haight St. (% 415-552-5095), for pretty
dresses, stylish shoes, and somewhat retro handbags; and Villains
Vault, 1653 and 1672 Haight St. (% 415-864-7727 or 415-626-5939), for
street wear and shoes. Most stores on Haight Street are open from 10
a.m. to 7 p.m. daily.
North Beach
North Beach is more than just a food-and-drink mecca — you can find all
sorts of curiosities and clothing off Columbus Avenue. The section of
Grant Avenue (completely different from the street of the same name in
Chinatown) from Union to Greenwich streets has a more Continental
accent, with stylish boutiques for clothes and accessories. Among the
finds — and there are many — head to Knitz & Leather, 1429 Grant Ave.
(% 415-391-3480), for handmade sweaters and leather jackets (open:
Tues–Sat 11 a.m.–7 p.m. and Sun noon to 5 p.m.). Old Vogue, 1412 Grant
St. (% 415-392-1522), is a better-organized and higher-quality vintage
shop than most of those on Haight Street. Ooma, 1422 Grant St. (% 415-
627-6963), displays the goods of local designers.
You don’t need to comb Italy for ceramics when you can shop at Biordi
Art Imports, 412 Columbus Ave., at Vallejo Street (% 415-392-8096;
www.biordi.com). You’ll find the most beautiful hand-painted Majolica
dishes and serving pieces nearly too pretty to use. It’s open Monday
through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
City Lights Bookstore, 261 Columbus Ave. (% 415-362-8193; www.
citylights.com), is famous for its Beat Generation roots, but it’s 
also a book fiend’s paradise. The first all-paperback bookstore in San
Francisco, this city institution dates to 1953, when Beat poet Lawrence
Ferlinghetti opened it. At the time, most people thought hardcover
books were superior to paperbacks in terms of both content and paper
quality. Ferlinghetti challenged that attitude and made great literature
available to everyone. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has des-
ignated the store a cultural and architectural landmark, assuring a long
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
206

and happy life for the building. Ferlinghetti’s brainchild is also on its 
way to becoming a national historic site. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to
midnight.
Admirers of chocolate can wedge themselves into XOX Truffles, 754
Columbus Ave. (% 415-421-4814; www.xoxtruffles.com), a tiny store
devoted to nickel-sized truffles in a huge assortment of flavors. These
bites of bliss are all handmade under the direction of a handsome
French chef, who removed himself from the rigors of the restaurant
world to bring pleasure to us chocoholics. Open Monday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Union and Chestnut streets
In a survey, one out of four visitors to San Francisco had plans to visit
Union Street between Fillmore Street and Van Ness Avenue in the Marina
district. Folks who love wandering in and out of specialty shops will
think they’ve hit pay dirt. Muni buses 22-Fillmore, 41-Union, 42–
Downtown Loop, and 45-Union/Stockton all run on Union Street.
Carol Doda, who shaped a career out of her chest long before implants
were considered accessories, runs a lingerie shop, Carol Doda’s
Champagne and Lace, at 1850 Union St. (% 415-776-6900). She carries
bras in regular and hard-to-find sizes, plus lots of other fun things. It’s
open daily from 12:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., Sunday until 5 p.m.
Cover yourself with beautiful adornments crafted by local artists at
Gallery of Jewels, 2101 Union St. (% 415-929-0259; www.galleryof
jewels.com), open Monday through Saturday 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.,
and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. You’ll find unique pieces of jewelry as well
as purses and hats on occasion.
Because man apparently does not live by cashmere alone, you may be
interested in perusing the Collectors Cave at 2072 Union St. (% 415-929-
0231; www.thecollectorscave.com). It displays all kinds of new and
old comic books, action figures, and sports cards for serious and not-
so-serious collectors. It’s open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to
6 p.m.
Mudpie, 1694 Union St. (% 415-771-9262), sells children’s expensive
clothes and gifts. The downstairs saleroom, where everything is half-
price, slightly alleviates sticker shock. It’s open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Another highly attractive, healthy shopping area is Chestnut Street in
Cow Hollow, which draws highly attractive, healthy locals with plenty of
discretionary cash. Neither Chestnut nor Union Street, a few blocks
south, has been able to fight off the invasion by some of the more ambi-
tious chain stores, but local neighborhood and merchant groups are vigi-
lant enough to keep them at a minimum. Muni bus 30-Stockton or
43-Masonic will get you to Chestnut Street.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 207

On the western end of Chestnut is a local independent, Books, Inc., 2251
Chestnut St. (% 415-931-3633; www.booksinc.net), which has a broad
inventory of reading material for the entire family. It’s open daily 9 a.m.
to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday until 11 p.m.
Pacific Heights
The tony neighborhood of Pacific Heights offers shoppers Fillmore
Street, which is chock-full of clothing boutiques and other cool places to
shop. Between Jackson and Sutter streets, you won’t be able to put your
credit card away.
Kiehl’s manufactures high-end, high-quality cosmetics and hair products
for men and women. Its shop at 2360 Fillmore St. (% 415-359-9260;
www.kiehls.com) is open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.,
Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Nest, 2300 Fillmore St., at Clay Street (% 415-292-6199;
www.nestsf.com), is yet another home store, but one that carries 
many old French decorative items, including quilts and linens. It’s open
Monday through Friday 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., Saturday until 6 p.m., and
Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
You don’t see many milliners left in the world, so a visit to Mrs. Dewson’s
Hats, 2050 Fillmore St. (% 415-346-1600; www.mrsdewsonhats.com), 
is a must if your chapeau is a little tattered. This place is home to the
“Willie Brim,” a fedora named after former Mayor Willie Brown. It’s open
Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday noon to 
4 p.m.
Polk Street
The stretch of road from Filbert to Broadway on the Russian Hill end of
Polk Street has blossomed into a hot spot for dining and shopping.
Along with a second location for Nest (see the preceding section), two
little shops for the home, La Place du Soleil, at 2356 Polk St. (% 415-
771-4252; open: Tues–Sat 11 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun noon to 5 p.m.), and La
Tulipe Noire, at 2418 Polk St. (% 415-922-2000; open: Tues–Sun 11
a.m.–7 p.m.), will seemingly transport you to the fourth arrondissement.
Sacramento Street
Some exclusive antiques shops as well as some of the best secondhand
stores in town operate in the section of Sacramento Street between
Spruce and Divisadero streets in Presidio Heights. The 1-California bus
takes you within 1 block of Sacramento Street.
Elaine Magnin Needlepoint has a shop at 3310 Sacramento St. (% 415-
931-3063; www.elainemagnin.com) and is the place to go if you wield a
mighty needle and are seeking some new patterns. It’s open Monday and
Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday until 5 p.m., and
Thursday and Friday until 6 p.m.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
208

If you want to see what the swells have cleaned out of their closets 
(the locals are going to hate me for this), head to GoodByes, 3464
Sacramento St., between Walnut and Laurel streets (% 415-346-6388;
www.goodbyessf.com). This consignment shop is the place for gently
worn men’s and women’s clothing. It’s open Monday through Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Thursday until 8 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to
5 p.m. A second store for women only is across the street (% 415-674-
0151).
Two uniquely stylish women’s clothing shops are Susan, 3685 Sacramento
St. (% 415-922-3685), and the Grocery Store, 3625 Sacramento St. 
(% 415-928-3615). Specializing in European fashion designers, they allow
you a look at the latest. Both stores are open Monday through Friday
10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Hayes Street
Naming the hippest shopping street in the city would be difficult, but if
forced, I’d have to say Hayes Street. Start at Grove and Gough, where
you’ll find the expanded MAC (Modern Appealing Clothing) store at 387
Grove St. (% 415-863-3011; open: Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun noon to 6
p.m.). From there, head 1 block south to Hayes Street and start walking
toward the Pacific. You’ll find a wealth of stuff here for all facets of your
life — unless you live like a Spartan or a monk, in which case you may
want to stop at the Gaia Tree, 575 Hayes St. (% 415-255-4848; open:
Mon–Tues 10 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Wed–Sat 10 a.m.–8 p.m., Sun noon to 6
p.m.), for a yoga mat or maybe a facial or a massage. See, there’s just no
escaping commerce. For things you needed to buy before you got on the
plane, stop at Flight 001, 525 Hayes St. (% 415-487-1001), which sells
those little spray bottles of Evian so you won’t dry up on the flight
home. If your feet hurt, stop in one of the many shoe stores here, includ-
ing Paolo Iantorno, 524 Hayes St. (% 415-552-4580), which sells beauti-
ful Italian-made creations for men and women. The shop also stocks
gorgeous handbags. Besides regular weekday hours, many of the stores
on these blocks are open Sunday afternoon.
Valencia Street
In the last decade or so, Valencia Street in the Mission District has been
developing into the shopping district for those who eschew the main-
stream. The blocks from 19th to 23rd streets still hold plenty of store-
front churches and used-appliance dens, but the cafes and restaurants
from the first wave of gentrification now accompany sellers of youthful
fashions, local art, and goods for the home. Of note is Paxton Gate, 824
Valencia St. (% 415-824-1872; open: Mon–Fri noon to 7 p.m., Sat–Sun 
11 a.m.–7 p.m.), part entomological display, part garden store, but nei-
ther description does this place justice. Almost next door is City Art
(% 415-970-9900; open: Wed–Sun noon to 9 p.m.), a co-op gallery featur-
ing San Francisco artists and photographers. Across the street is a pub-
lishing company that collaborates with artists, Little Otsu, 849 Valencia
St. (% 415-255-7900; www.littleotsu.com). Tables here are strewn
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 209

with graphic novels, edgy comics, stationery, and interesting T-shirts,
among other gifty items. And don’t pass by Encantada Gallery of Fine
Arts, 904 Valencia St. (% 415-642-3939; open: Tues–Sun noon to 6 p.m.,
until 8 p.m. Fri–Sat), which has a wonderful collection of Mexican art and
pottery, as well as a changing exhibit of paintings and mixed media. One
of my favorite local women’s clothing designers, Dema, has a store and
workshop at 1038 Valencia St. (% 415-206-0500). Dema’s patterns and
colors are spirit raisers. My favorite beret was fashioned at Laku, 1089
Valencia St. (% 415-695-1462; open: Tues–Sat 11:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m., Sun
noon to 5 p.m.), which also sells handmade, fanciful slippers for babies
and big people, jewelry, and Japanese-inspired accessories. From down-
town, use BART, exit at the 24th Street Station, and walk 1 block west.
Most of the Valencia Street shops close on Monday.
Hunting for bargains in SoMa and beyond
The discount manufacturers based South of Market (SoMa) have made
bargain shopping in San Francisco a popular pursuit. The area between
Townsend and Bryant streets and Second and Fourth streets is great for
bargains.
The hip retailer Rolo has a sale outlet, Rolo Garage, at 1301 Howard St.,
at Ninth Street (% 415-861-1999). It’s open Monday through Saturday
from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday noon to 6 p.m.
Two worthwhile stores are off Second Street, between Bryant and
Brannan streets, in South Park — a little sub-neighborhood south of
Market, once infamous for ties to the dot.com industry. Isda & Co.
Outlet, 28 South Park (% 415-512-1610; open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m.),
carries fashionable women’s wear suitable for the office and after-hours
at great prices. Jeremy’s, 2 South Park (% 415-882-4929; open: Mon–Sat
11 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun until 5 p.m.), is filled with last season’s markdowns,
returns, and display items from department stores and some famous
names.
Did your son outgrow his sneakers yesterday? Did you? You’re gonna 
go wild in the Skechers USA outlet in the Mission, at 2600 Mission St.
(% 415-401-6211). It’s open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
Sunday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. If you or someone in your party needs some-
thing dressier, dance over to the DSW near Union Square, 111 Powell St.
(% 415-445-9511). It’s open Monday to Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
Sunday until 8 p.m.
Other favorites
Knitters in the know will find their way to Noe Knit, 3957 24th St. 
(% 415-970-9750; www.noeknit.com), open Monday through Thursday
11 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Friday to Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; it’s within walk-
ing distance of the J-Church Muni line’s 24th Street exit. The Noe Valley
neighborhood also abounds with good places to eat. For every sort of
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
210

knitting accessory and a huge selection of gorgeous yarns, make a pil-
grimage to ImagiKnit, 3897 18th St., in the Castro (% 415-621-6642;
www.imagiknit.com). Open Monday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 
6:30 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., this truly is a knitter’s paradise.
An excellent independent bookseller can be found just south of Market
Street, not far from Yerba Buena Plaza. Alexander Book Co., 50 Second
St. (% 415-495-2992; www.alexanderbook.com), has three floors of
well-chosen books to peruse, and the staff is knowledgeable and helpful.
You can locate chocolate nearly everywhere, but only one store will sat-
isfy your craving for information and sugar. Fog City News, 455 Market
St. (% 415-543-7400; www.fogcitynews.com), doesn’t merely sell inter-
national papers and a full selection of magazines. It also carries choco-
late bars from around the world that have been carefully vetted by the
owner. You can talk chocolate here and be taken very, very seriously.

Following an Itinerary: 
Four Great Options 
to Make Your Day
In This Chapter
 Making the most out of three to five days
 Showing the kids a good time
 Taking a food-lover’s holiday
V
isitors naturally want to pack as much as possible into a sightseeing
trip, in case they don’t have a chance to return. Having been in that
position myself, I’ve come to the conclusion that travel isn’t pleasurable
if all you do is run around checking off sights as if you’re grocery shop-
ping. My idea of a good time is visiting one or two important sights in a
day (or sometimes just walking past the front portal and waving) and
then finding somewhere to sit and watch the world pass by. (I must
admit that I felt foolish for missing the Eiffel Tower on my first visit to
Paris — and I was in the neighborhood.) You may prefer a compromise
between these approaches, in which case I suggest you decide in
advance what you must see, and then fit in whatever else you can based
on how much time and energy you have.
On that note, the following suggested itineraries are intended for first-
time visitors who want to catch as much as possible without completely
exhausting themselves or their companions. I’ve packed in a lot, but you
can pick and choose (or completely ignore) parts of each.
San Francisco in Three Days
Three days is barely enough to “get” San Francisco, so I’m going to keep
you within the city limits for the entire time. The following list takes you
step by step through the city.

 Day 1: Find Market Street and catch one of the historic F-Market
streetcars (see Chapter 8) heading toward PIER 39 and Fisherman’s
Wharf. If you haven’t eaten breakfast, stop off first at Café Mason or
Dottie’s True Blue Café (see Chapter 10). If it happens to be
Saturday, exit at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market (see Chapter 10).
A few local restaurants — Hayes Street Grill (see Chapter 10) and
Rose Pistola — have booths where you can eat your morning meal,
or you can make yourself quite happy with coffee and fresh pas-
tries from Frog Hollow Farms inside the building. When you reach
PIER 39, greet the sea lions (follow the barking) and continue to
the end of the pier for a dead-on view of Alcatraz Island. Walk to
Aquatic Park to complete a tour of Fisherman’s Wharf (see
Chapter 11). You’ll pass the Hyde Street Pier and the Maritime
National Museum — pop in if you like ships — as well as
Ghirardelli Square. On Bay Street, catch a 30-Stockton bus to
Chestnut Street. If it’s not too soon to shop or eat, Mamacita (see
Chapter 10) is a great choice for Mexican food. The bus ends up at
Beach Street, and your task is to walk from the Palace of Fine Arts,
through Crissy Field and the Presidio, to the Golden Gate Bridge.
Follow the joggers along the bay; there’s a path. The 29-Sunset bus
will also take you there and back. End the afternoon around Union
Square, window shopping along Stockton and Sutter. Change your
clothes, then go to the Top of the Mark (see Chapter 10) for an
aperitif and a grand view. For dinner, see what’s cooking on Belden
Place (see Chapter 10). If you still have a bit of steam left, drop by
Biscuits and Blues (see Chapter 16) for a musical nightcap.
 Day 2: This day starts early with another transportation highlight.
Fling yourself on a Powell-Hyde cable car (see Chapter 8) for the
brief ride to Lombard Street. Walk down the staircases on either
side and, heading north, find the San Francisco Art Institute at 800
Chestnut St. Inside the campus, follow the signs to the cafe for
breakfast or a snack (Mon–Fri only). This is a funky place with
unobstructed views of the bay and a menu of sandwiches, bagels,
and vegetarian entrees priced for starving artists. Follow Filbert
Street to Washington Square Park in North Beach, a modest
pocket of green with plentiful benches on the perimeter and the
twin spires of Saints Peter and Paul’s Church solidly cutting into
the sky to the north. Park yourself on a bench, maybe with a latte
in hand from Caffe Roma (see Chapter 10). Then stroll around
North Beach if you like, or walk up Grant Avenue past Union Street
and follow the signs to Coit Tower (see Chapter 11). From there,
return to North Beach for a leisurely lunch at L’Osteria del Forno
or Cafe Zoetrope (see Chapter 10), or pick up a sandwich at one of
the delis and have a picnic of sorts in Portsmouth Square (above
the parking garage on Kearny Street between Washington and Clay;
see Chapter 11), a short walk away. Spend the afternoon exploring
Chinatown (see Chapter 11). If you’re in the mood for Chinese cui-
sine for dinner, see Chapter 10 for suggestions. Then head back to
North Beach for a performance of Beach Blanket Babylon (see
Chapter 15).
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
214

 Day 3: Enjoy a walk in the park — Golden Gate Park (see Chap-
ter 11) — where you can row a boat on Stow Lake, hunt for bison,
and smell the flowers in the Strybing Arboretum. Find lunch over
on Ninth Avenue and then stroll down Irving Street, a typical neigh-
borhood shopping block. Alternatively, exit the park on Stanyon
Street and take in Haight-Ashbury, also a typical neighborhood —
for San Francisco. In the afternoon, a trip to the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art (see Chapter 11) finishes the artistic por-
tion of your vacation. Take a rest stop in Yerba Buena Gardens
(see Chapter 11), across the street. Then dine around Union
Square if you’re ambitious enough to see an 8 p.m. show at ACT or
another theater. Otherwise, hail a cab and head to a Mission
District restaurant such as Delfina or Foreign Cinema (see Chap-
ter 10), and pretend you’re a local. Night owls can finish the
evening at a salsa dance club such as El Rio, or hang out with the
hipsters at the Make-Out Room (see Chapter 16).
San Francisco in Five Days
For a four- or five-day trip, you can add the following days to the itiner-
ary in the preceding section.
 Day 4: By now, you’ve already covered a fair portion of the city; it’s
probably time to hug a tree (you are in Northern California, after
all). Rent a car or take a guided tour (see Chapter 11) and cross the
Golden Gate Bridge into Marin County. Hike Muir Woods in the
morning (take the Stinson Beach exit) and have lunch near Muir
Beach at the English Tudor–style Pelican Inn, at the end of Muir
Wood Road at Highway 1 (% 415-383-6000; www.pelicaninn.com).
The inn is a short walk from the beach, which lies below a hikable
hill. Stop in Sausalito on your way back to the city for ice cream or
just a walk along the bay front — the San Francisco skyline is quite
the sight, but Sausalito itself, though postcard pretty, is quite
touristy. In the evening, eat dinner in Japantown at Mifune in the
Japan Center for noodles, Isuzu for sushi or tempura, or Yoshi’s, if
you want to splurge (see Chapter 10 for each). See what’s playing at
the Sundance Kabuki cinema on Post and Fillmore streets.
 Day 5: This may be the morning to get in your trip to Alcatraz
Island (see Chapter 11) or to trek to the Palace of the Legion of
Honor (see Chapter 11) for another dose of culture. For lunch, try
the Tadich Grill (see Chapter 10), the oldest restaurant in
California (although it’s been in its current location only since
1967). The menu of favorites, such as lobster thermidor, accompa-
nies a side of local history and an active bar. Then spend the after-
noon catching up on shopping, or stroll down to Pier 5 near the
Ferry Building (east of Broadway), where you can hang out on
benches and watch skateboarders or just admire the view. In the
evening, splurge on a fancy dinner — Ame and Quince Restaurant
are two good choices (see Chapter 10).
Chapter 13: Four Great Options to Make Your Day 215

San Francisco for Families with Kids
How to keep the kids engaged and happy (for example, not asking what
time it is, what they’re doing tomorrow, and when they’re eating)
depends on their ages and interests. Here’s a list to meet any need:
 For families with little kids: A day around Golden Gate Park is
ideal. The Japanese Tea Garden is memorable, and the California
Academy of Sciences is a must. You can’t miss with a bike ride or
the paddleboats around Stow Lake, and youngsters with energy to
spare will gravitate toward the big, imaginatively designed play-
ground. When lunch beckons, you can feed the family reasonably at
Park Chow (see Chapter 10) on Ninth Avenue, just a block from the
park entrance. The zoo (see Chapter 11) is a logical alternative for
a morning’s activity as well; it’s easy to reach on a streetcar and, on
your return downtown, you may head to Yerba Buena Gardens for
lunch and a spin on the merry-go-round. If a quieter afternoon
seems like a better idea, consider a ferryboat ride to Sausalito and
back (see Chapter 11).
 For families with slightly older progeny: Spend a delightful day
taking the cable car to Fisherman’s Wharf (see Chapter 8), where
PIER 39 holds sway, with its many shops and video games. You can
avoid the scene, if you prefer, with strategically timed tickets to
Alcatraz (see Chapter 11); think about bringing along sandwiches
or snacks, because most of the food around the pier is overpriced
and underwhelming. If you can stave off starvation until your
return from solitary confinement, hustle everyone over to North
Beach on the Mason-Powell cable car and eat at Il Pollaio (see
Chapter 10). Chinatown is convenient to North Beach, and kids
love browsing in the shops. For dinner, Lichee Garden (see
Chapter 10) is a good family-style Chinese restaurant, or you can
eat at one of the North Beach eateries such as Tommaso’s
Restaurant (see Chapter 10).
 For families with kids of varied ages: Yerba Buena Gardens (see
Chapter 11) is a godsend. Teens are usually more than happy to
hang out in Metreon’s game room and at Zeum, while younger sib-
lings can ride the merry-go-round and then run around the gardens.
Skating or bowling works for everyone, and food options within
walking distance are plentiful. For a step above the center’s offer-
ings, Restaurant Lulu (see Chapter 10) is an excellent choice for
dinner.
San Francisco for Foodies
You could spend a week honing your talents in the kitchen at Tante
Marie’s Cooking School (% 415-788-6699; www.tantemarie.com), and
that would certainly qualify you as a foodie. Or you could imitate my
friend Bev, who flies up from Los Angeles on a regular basis to raid
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
216

North Beach for supplies, and then orders huge meals at the restaurant
of the moment. Because the cooking classes run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
and 6 to 10 p.m., let’s make like Bev for a day instead.
Wake up and smell the cappuccino and a raisin roll at a local favorite,
Caffe Greco, 423 Columbus Ave., in North Beach (% 415-397-6261).
While you sip, make a mental note of how much room you have in your
suitcase for imported Italian delicacies, then walk a block to Molinari
Delicatessen (see Chapter 10). If you have some way of refrigerating
fresh sausages and cheese, you can take better advantage of the selec-
tion here. If not, consider ordering a sandwich to go for later. Drop by
Liguria Bakery (see Chapter 10) for a sheet of pizza focaccia, which will
make you the envy of your fellow airplane passengers on the ride home.
If you need a new pizza stone, go to A. Cavalli & Co., 1441 Stockton St.
(% 415-421-4219), which sells Italian cards and maps as well as cooking
utensils.
Don’t miss immersing yourself in San Francisco’s cultural diversity by
eating as much dim sum as possible and stocking up on the wealth of
ingredients available in the ethnic enclaves. Bev’s favorite, Mayflower in
the Richmond District, 6255 Geary Blvd. (% 415-387-8338), makes fine
dumplings and won’t be mobbed like the dim sum places in Chinatown
(few tourists venture this far out on Geary Boulevard). After lunch, walk
or take a bus north down Clement Street, 1 block west of Geary, and stop
by Green Apple Books, 506 Clement St., to peruse a sizable selection of
used cookbooks. You can find many produce, fish, and meat markets
along Clement, as well as housewares stores. May Wah, 547 Clement St.,
is worth a look, as is Kamei, 606 Clement St. If you’re serious about
eating, you’ll probably be ready for a snack or at least coffee by this time.
Bev fights for parking on Valencia Street in order to down an espresso at
Ritual Coffee while musing over taquerías. Fortunately, Pancho Villa (see
Chapter 10) tosses together a steak and prawn quesadilla that is unparal-
leled for quality and price. It’s in the Mission District, where you’ll also
want to visit La Palma, 2884 24th St., at Florida Street (% 415-647-1500),
for fresh tortillas, dried chilies, and other Mexican cooking essentials.
Make your way to 18th and Dolores Street for ice cream that’ll have you
talking to yourself at Bi-Rite Creamery (% 415-626-5600). Request one
scoop of salted caramel and one of malted vanilla with peanut brittle and
milk chocolate. Finally, catch the J-Church to the Embarcadero and enter
the Ferry Building. Find Ferry Plaza Wine Merchant (% 415-391-9400),
sit down at the bar, and have a tasting. For dinner, consider a Mission
District destination such as Range (see Chapter 10) or a high-end experi-
ence such as Restaurant Gary Danko (see Chapter 10). If you have
another day, or you’re ready for more, see Chapter 14 for additional
dining destinations.

Three Day Trips
In This Chapter

 Coasting to Half Moon Bay
 Drinking in the Wine Country
I
f you have the time to spare, or want to break up your trip with a
glimpse of other parts of Northern California, here are three fabu-
lous day trips that will show you some of the region surrounding 
San Francisco.
Day Trip #1: Berkeley
As you approach Berkeley, a mere 20 minutes over the Bay Bridge, you’ll
know you aren’t in San Francisco anymore. The weather is an immediate
giveaway — although the temperature isn’t dramatically different, San
Francisco’s ever-present summer fog disappears. Berkeley is also
smaller, and much of its cultural life revolves around the University of
California at Berkeley (UCB) campus. One thing the cities have in
common is a devotion to fine dining. In fact, one excellent reason to visit
Berkeley is to eat a great meal.
Getting there
You can use BART to reach Berkeley, but taking a car is better. Most
people drive over the Bay Bridge and follow the signs to Highway 80.
The exits include Ashby Avenue, University, and Gilman. If you intend to
begin your day on Fourth Street (see “Shopping delights” later in this
chapter), take the University Avenue exit. If the University is your first
stop, an alternate route is Highway 24, exiting on scenic Claremont
Avenue. Claremont intersects College Avenue, which leads directly to
the campus while avoiding the less handsome flatlands of Berkeley.

Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 219

If you visit on a Thursday, you get free admission to UCB museums and
the botanical garden.
Seeing the sights
To my mind, an ideal day in Berkeley revolves around lunch or dinner at
Chez Panisse (see “Dining locally” later in this chapter). The food is as
close to perfect as food gets. If your reservation is for dinner, you can
easily spend your time shopping on Fourth Street (see “Shopping
delights” later in this chapter), walking around Tilden Park, and seeing
what’s up at the UCB campus. If you’ve made lunch reservations, tour
UCB in the morning and hike in Tilden Park or check out the merchan-
dise on Telegraph Avenue or Fourth Street in the afternoon.
The attractive, active campus of University of California at Berkeley is
the biggest sight in Berkeley, so to speak. The Visitor Information
Center is at 101 University Hall, 2200 University Ave., at Oxford Street
(% 510-642-5215). You can join a free 10 a.m. campus tour from the
center Monday through Friday. Weekend tours leave from the Campanile
at 10 a.m. Saturdays and 1 p.m. Sundays.
Other notable UCB stops include the Hearst Museum of Anthropology
(% 510-642-6271; http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu; open: Wed–
Sat 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Sun noon to 4 p.m.; admission: free; tours $5
adults, $2 children under 18); the Berkeley Art Museum at 2621 Durant
Ave. and 2626 Bancroft Way (% 510-642-0808; www.bampfa.berkeley.
edu; open: Wed–Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m.; admission: $8 adults, $5 seniors, stu-
dents and children, free the first Thurs of every month); and the 307-
foot-tall Campanile, or Sather Tower, in the center of campus, where you
can take an elevator to the top for excellent views of Berkeley and the
bay (open: daily; admission: $2 adults, $1 seniors, free for kids under 18).
Above the campus in the lush hills is the UC Berkeley Botanical
Garden, 200 Centennial Dr. (% 510-643-2755; www.botanicalgarden.
berkeley.edu; open: daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; admission: $7 adults, $5 sen-
iors 65 and older, $5 juniors 13–18, $2 kids 5–12, free first Thurs of the
month). It features 13,000 plants, including cactus and rose gardens. It’s
a good place for an easy hike. Farther up the road, the kid-friendly
Lawrence Hall of Science (% 510-642-5132; www.lawrencehallof
science.org; open: daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; admission: $11 adults; $9 sen-
iors, students, and children 7–18; $6 kids ages 3–6) brings science up
close and personal. This is an excellent hands-on museum that has activ-
ities for kids from 3 to 12.
Shops, cafes, and well-stocked bookstores surround the campus. To get
a sense of Berkeley street life, walk along Telegraph Avenue from
Bancroft to Ashby, and get your fill of cappuccino, street vendors, 
psychic readers, and the occasional weirdo.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
220

Shopping delights
Close to the University exit off I-80 is Fourth Street, a mecca for shop-
pers from all over the Bay Area. It started out small, with a few outlet
stores and a popular diner, and over the years developed into a full-
fledged destination for fashion, food, and home décor. Begin by oohing
over the gorgeous accessories for home and garden at the Gardener,
1836 Fourth St. (% 510-548-4545; www.thegardener.com; open: Mon–
Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–6 p.m.), and keep heading on down the
block.
Dining locally
Each of these restaurants is a great place to dine, and Chez Panisse is
definitely a destination eatery.
Bette’s Oceanview Diner
$
AMERICAN
You can sit down here for a homey breakfast or lunch featuring tender
baked goods, tasty salads, and Bette’s famous pancakes. Expect crowds
and a long wait on weekends. Next door, Bette’s sells takeout sandwiches,
salads, and desserts to impatient hungry people.
1807 Fourth St., Berkeley. % 510-644-3230. www.worldpantry.com/bettes/
home.html. No reservations. Main courses: $4.95–$12. MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 6:30
a.m.–2:30 p.m., Sat–Sun 6:30 a.m.–4 p.m.
Café Rouge
$–$$
MEDITERRANEAN
Fourth Street neighborhood residents don’t have many reasons to stray.
Everything you need is nearby, including a lovely meal at this French-style
bistro opened by a Chez Panisse kitchen alumnus. Meat eaters will be
charmed by the menu (go admire the butcher counter in the back), while
mollusk fans can turn to the oysters. Desserts shine as well.
1782 Fourth St., Berkeley. % 510-525-1440. www.caferouge.net. Reservations
advised. Main courses: $16–$36. MC, V. Open: Mon 11:30 a.m.–3 p.m., Tues–Thurs
11:30 a.m.–9:30 p.m., Fri–Sat 11:30 a.m.–10:30 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–9 p.m.
Chez Panisse Restaurant and Café
$$$–$$$$
CALIFORNIA/FRENCH
Alice Waters, the owner of Chez Panisse, is an icon in the food world,
respected for adhering to her vision of food as a gift we give daily to our
loved ones (including you) and for serving beautifully constructed dishes.
Eating here is one of the nicer things you’ll do for yourself. Dinner down-
stairs is $55 to $90 prix fixe, depending on the night. The cafe is moder-
ately priced, comparatively speaking, but expect to spend a lot more than
you think prudent for lunch. It’s worth it.
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 221

1517 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley. % 510-548-5525. www.chezpanisse.com. Advance
reservations a must for dinner in the restaurant; recommended for dinner in the cafe.
Main courses: $55–$90 prix fixe downstairs; $18–$26 in the cafe. AE, DISC, MC, V.
Open: Restaurant Mon–Sat, first seating 6–6:30 p.m., second seating 8:30–9:30p.m.;
cafe Mon–Thurs 11:30 a.m.–3 p.m. and 5–10:30 p.m., Fri–Sat 11:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m. and
5–11:30 p.m.
Day Trip #2: Half Moon Bay
A scenic 30-mile drive south on Highway 1 past the tiny hamlets of Moss
Beach and El Granada brings you to Half Moon Bay, a coastal agricul-
tural town with unequivocal appeal to nature lovers, beachcombers, and
wildlife watchers. Originally inhabited by the Costanoan Indians, then
deeded to early Spanish settlers, it’s a center of floriculture, commercial
fishing, and tourism — although the charming village has not given way
to all things touristic. It keeps the brand names outside of town. Given
Half Moon Bay’s proximity to the big city, a day trip couldn’t be easier,
but to feel as if you’ve had a little country escape, you’ll want to spend
the night.
Deciding when to visit
When planning your trip, remember that you’ll be on the coast. If it’s
foggy in San Francisco, it’ll be foggy here, too. If possible, avoid summer
weekends and their traffic on the roads south. Also check ahead to make
sure that Highway 1 through Pacifica is open (rockslides at Devil’s Slide
are a regular problem, especially in wet weather). October brings
crowds for the pumpkin festival, so skip weekends around Halloween
unless you have kids along and are in the market for squash. The best
times to view seasonal flora and fauna in the area are:
 Wildflowers: February through July
 Elephant seals: Pups arrive December 15 through March
 Bird-watching: Late fall and early Spring
 Gray whales: Late December through early April
And another word of advice: Wear layers. The weather in Half Moon Bay
is often chilly and sometimes foggy in the summer.
Getting to the Shore
The scenic route from San Francisco involves a drive toward the Pacific
Ocean (take Geary Boulevard to Ocean Beach and turn left). Look for
Highway 35 south, which will link up to Highway 1. Otherwise, take
Highway 280 or 101 south to Highway 92 west. Depending on traffic, the
drive will take around 40 minutes.

Seeing the sights
The town of Half Moon Bay itself is worth a stroll — there’s a good book-
shop, art galleries, and many gift shops. The Spanishtown Historical
Society preserves the former name of the village and publishes a self-
guided walking tour booklet that costs $3.50 at the Chamber of
Commerce, 520 Kelly Ave. (% 650-726-8380).
Four miles north on Highway 1 is Pillar Point Harbor, where you’ll 
find the whale-watching boats (book through Huck Finn Sportfishing,
% 650-726-7133; www.huckfinnsportfishing.com); sea kayak rentals
and tours from Half Moon Bay Kayak Co., 1 Johnson Pier (% 650-773-
6101); and unspoiled views from the piers and pathways. During the
season, boats at the dock sell live crabs that you can have boiled and
cracked at the harbor (see “Dining Locally,” below). You can also begin
the Coastside Trail hike from the harbor heading south. It takes you
past beaches and stunning vistas.
Bird-watching and tide pooling are favorite activities in the area; appar-
ently 20 percent of all North American bird species make Pillar Point
Marsh, between the harbor and Mavericks (the famous surfing spot), a
regular stop on their migratory route. At low tide, take the California
Street exit west off Highway 1 in Moss Beach and head for the Fitzgerald
Marine Reserve (% 650-728-3584), where you’ll likely find hermit crabs
and starfish hanging about.
Although you will be competing for space with fellow travelers on the
weekends, there are two compelling reasons to do so. Saturday and
Sunday are the only days Harley Farms Goat Dairy, 205 North St.,
Pescadero (% 650-879-0480; www.harleyfarms.com), is open to the
public. It offers two-hour afternoon tours by appointment only ($20 per
person). Located about 15 minutes south on Highway 1, this is the home
of the friendliest goats on the planet (there’s a one-year waiting list for
the babies) and a fine example of a sustainable, community-oriented
family farm. If you can’t make the tour, you can always visit the farm
shop (open: daily). As long as you’re in tiny Pescadero, stop by
Arcangeli’s Market, 287 Stage Rd. (% 650-879-0147), to pick up a round
of artichoke bread. It’s 2 miles inland off Pescadero Road.
The second reason to deal with the traffic is to spend Sunday afternoon
at a very popular Bach Dancing and Dynamite Society concert. A long-
standing tradition, the music, which veers toward all forms of jazz,
starts at 4:30 p.m. Buy tickets (from $30) at the door. The venue is
located at Douglas Beach House, 311 Mirada Rd., Half Moon Bay 
(% 650-726-4143; www.bachddsoc.org).
Elephant seals and sea lions favor Año Nuevo State Reserve (% 800-
444-4445), a 27-mile drive south of Half Moon Bay. Most of the year visi-
tors are allowed to stroll about unsupervised, but from December
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
224

through March, when the seals are birthing their pups, tours are guided
and are by reservation only.
The coast has beaches aplenty, and you’ll probably see surfers out there
with the sea lions, but swimming is not advised because it’s not safe.
Dining locally
Favorites in the area include the Moss Beach Distillery, 140 Beach Way,
Moss Beach (% 650-728-5595; www.mossbeachdistillery.com) and
the newer Sam’s Chowder House, 4210 N. Cabrillo Hwy., El Granada 
(% 650-712-0245; www.samschowderhouse.com) for fish and views. For
a gourmet lunch or dinner, don’t pass up a local treasure, Pasta Moon
Ristorante, 315 Main St., Half Moon Bay (% 650-726-5125; www.pasta
moon.com). The informality of this attractive Italian restaurant suits the
town, and the cuisine is some of the best locally grown food around. The
bread and toothsome pastas are made on premises; the roasted beet
salad with Harley Farms shaved ricotta will turn even beet loathers into
beet lovers; the clam chowder is the most flavorful I’ve ever tasted. If
you wish to take advantage of Dungeness crab season, from November
through June — and why think twice about that, I ask — you can choose
a couple of live crabs right off the boats in Pillar Point Harbor for
around $4 a pound. Take them up to the nice people at Princeton
Seafood, 9 Johnson Pier (% 650-726-2722), who will cook, crack, and
clean them for around $2 per crab. Pick up bread and accompaniments
at Cunha’s Country Store, 448 Main St., Half Moon Bay (% 650-726-
4071), before driving to the harbor.
Spending the night
If you’d like to turn your day trip into an overnight, here are two excel-
lent options. For more hotel or B&B choices, contact the Half Moon Bay
Coastside Chamber of Commerce (% 650-726-8380; www.halfmoon
baychamber.org).
Old Thyme Inn
$$–$$$$
Half Moon Bay
Half Moon’s Bay shops and restaurants are only a couple of blocks from
this beautifully maintained 1898 Princess Anne Victorian bed-and-break-
fast. It’s a convenient, comfortably intimate place. Romantics should
request the Garden Room, with its four-poster canopy bed, double
whirlpool tub, and fireplace. All rooms boast cushy feather beds. Breakfast
is ample and delicious; you’ll want to walk it off on the Coastal Trail, then
return in time for late afternoon wine and cheese. Rick and Kathy, the ami-
able yet discreet owners, are a great source of local information.

The Ritz-Carlton
$$$$
Half Moon Bay
It doesn’t get any prettier or more deluxe than this Ritz, a cliffside desti-
nation resort and spa surrounded by two golf courses and the ocean. The
oceanview rooms are premium, but at this price point, there’s no reason
not to go all the way. Lounging by the fire pit on the deck in an Adirondack
chair, listening to the lone bagpipe player bidding farewell to the waning
sun, will not be an inducement to go into town. The nice thing about this
hotel is that it takes care of all your needs — assuming your needs include
spa treatments, really good food, and staring out over the water toward
the horizon.

Day Trip #3: The Wine Country
About an hour’s drive north of San Francisco is gorgeous Napa Valley,
America’s most celebrated wine-producing region. Less than 30 miles
from end to end, this fertile area brims with world-class wine-tasting
rooms, excellent restaurants, and marvelous resorts and inns.
Just to the west of Napa Valley along Highway 12 is Sonoma Valley.
Peaceful, quieter, and somewhat less tourist-oriented, Sonoma Valley is
equal to its neighbor as a grape-lover’s paradise. Although both valleys
are vacation destinations, many visitors arrive for a day of wine tasting
and then turn around and head back to San Francisco. That’s not the
ideal way to get the most out of this bucolic piece of earth. If at all possi-
ble, stay a few days to relax and renew before heading back to tackle the
big city.
Planning a visit to the Wine Country
Earlier in this book, I warn you against renting a car during your stay in
San Francisco. In this section, I recant — for your Wine Country trip,
anyway — because the best way to tour is by car. If you don’t want to
drive, you can join an organized tour. But if you want to spend a night or
two in Sonoma or in one of the towns near Napa, or if you want to visit
smaller, less commercial wineries than those the tour companies
choose, you’ll need to drive yourself.
Getting to the Wine Country
Of the two possible routes, the faster one is across the San
Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge (I-80). The more scenic path crosses the
Golden Gate Bridge and meanders up through Marin County on U.S. 101.
For the return trip, from Napa, I highly recommend taking I-80 rather
than U.S. 101 over the Golden Gate Bridge, especially if you’re traveling
on a weekend. But to get back from Sonoma, use the Golden Gate Bridge.

The Wine Country
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 227
If you decide to go the Bay Bridge route to Napa, drive east over the
bridge (I-80) and then north to the Napa/Highway 29 exit near Vallejo.
Highway 29 is the main road through Napa Valley. The trip takes approxi-
mately 70 minutes.
If you decide to go over the Golden Gate Bridge, continue on U.S. 101
north to Novato, where you need to pick up Highway 37 east. Then, if
you’re interested in a pleasant drive and aren’t in a big hurry, take
Highway 121 (the Sonoma Highway) north toward Sonoma and east to
Napa, if that’s your destination, where you’ll end up on Highway 29. If
Sonoma is your destination, take Highway 12. Make sure to have a map
handy. This drive takes about 90 minutes.
Contact the Napa Valley Conference & Visitors Bureau, 1310 Napa
Town Center, Napa, CA 94559 (% 707-226-7459; www.napavalley.com),
for maps to help get you on your way.

Picking the best time to visit
The most popular seasons for touring Napa and Sonoma valleys are
summer and fall. The summers are hot in Wine Country, which is one
reason it’s a favorite with fog-bound San Franciscans. September and
October are extremely busy due to the crush, or grape harvest, when the
sweet aroma of must (crushed grapes) fills the air.
Wine Country is delightful any time of year. In the winter, restaurants
aren’t jammed and traffic is light. Spring is beautiful and still relatively
uncrowded. However, if the forecast calls for rain, I recommend you save
this trip for another time. If you do plan to visit Wine Country during
summer or autumn, make lodging reservations early.
You’ll meet with a lot more traffic and tourists on weekends than on
weekdays. Also, Golden Gate Bridge traffic heading north on Friday
afternoons and south on Sunday afternoons is amazing, and I don’t mean
that in a positive way. Let the guys with weekend plans sit and stew on
101. Go while everyone else is at work.
Looking out for your safety
Although you may taste wines all along the 35-mile route through Napa
and on the scenic roads through Sonoma, the rules of drinking and driv-
ing (and common sense) still apply. All those sips add up more quickly
than you think. Every tasting room has containers for spitting out the
wine so you can taste without actually letting it go to your head.
Highway 29 is dangerous, even if you’re not drinking. This two-lane thor-
oughfare through Napa Valley has been the scene of many accidents,
especially at night.
Taking an escorted Wine Country tour
A good option if you don’t feel comfortable driving, or if you’re on a tight
schedule, is a one-day Wine Country tour. On these six- to nine-hour
tours, you can usually visit two to three wineries and have lunch in a
picturesque village. The downside of a tour like this is that you won’t
see some of the great wineries that aren’t part of the tour itinerary, you
won’t have time to relax in places that catch your eye, and you may not
be able to choose where you want to eat.
But if you’re interested in the escorted tours, you have two main
options: a tour that starts in San Francisco or a tour that starts in the
Wine Country. Here are a few good tours that leave from San Francisco:
 The Great Pacific Tour Company (% 415-626-4499; www.great
pacifictour.com) picks you up at your San Francisco hotel and
delivers you back after tastings at two Sonoma wineries, a picnic
lunch, and a tour of Domaine Chandon, a sparkling wine producer
in Napa. The cost, including lunch, is $95 for adults, $93 for seniors,
and $83 for children 5 to 11.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
228

 California Wine Tours (% 800-294-6386; www.californiawine
tours.com) offers several Wine Country outings from Napa and
Sonoma, and one originating in San Francisco. Customers take the
8:55 a.m. ferry to Vallejo, where a limo meets them for a six-hour
excursion that includes five diverse wineries, including V. Sattuoi,
where you can picnic. The price is $89 per person, not including
round-trip tickets on the ferry, taxes, or tips.
 Tower Tours (% 866-345-8687; www.towertours.net) takes you
to Napa and Sonoma valleys for the day, with stops at three winer-
ies and lunch in Yountville or the town of Sonoma, with a little time
to shop. The charge is $67 for adults, $63 for seniors, and $46 for
children 5 to 11.
And here are some of the best tours originating in the Wine Country:
 Wine Country Jeep Tours (% 800-539-5337; www.jeeptours.com)
will plan a custom three- to four-hour winery tour that can include
some off-road trailblazing and a picnic lunch. The cost is $75 per
person, plus $25 each for each additional hour.
 Napa Winery Shuttle (% 707-257-1950; www.wineshuttle.com), a
small, family-run enterprise, gets my vote for value and flexibility.
You and your shuttle driver plan the itinerary, although the com-
pany does have some favorite wineries it likes to show off. The
price is $60 per person for the day — approximately 10 a.m. to 4 or
5 p.m.
 The Napa Valley Wine Train (% 800-427-4124 or 707-253-2111;
www.winetrain.com), like a gourmet restaurant on wheels, choo-
choos 36 miles through the valley, from the town of Napa to the vil-
lage of St. Helena and back. Prices for lunch, Sunday brunch, and
dinner tours start at $89. These tours primarily involve dining and
admiring the gorgeous scenery. Two trips that include stops at a
winery are the Grgich Hills Private Winery Tour and Tasting, a lunch-
eon ride that costs $113 per person, and the Domaine Chandon
Winery excursion at $128 per person. Onboard the train is a wine-
tasting car with an attractive bar and knowledgeable host. The three-
hour tours depart from the train station at 1275 McKinstry St. in
downtown Napa. You must make reservations for the train. If you
don’t want to drive to Napa, for $148, San Francisco Sightseeing
Gray Line (% 888-428-6937 or 415-558-9400; www.graylinesan
francisco.com) will bus you to and from your hotel to the wine
train station in Napa for the excursion.
Mapping out your winery journey
A single day in Wine Country can’t do the area justice and will leave you
wanting more. But if that’s all the time you have, plan to visit no more
than three to four wineries, one before lunch and two or three after, 
followed by a late-afternoon snack or an early dinner.
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 229

If you spend two days and a night, you’ll have the chance to do some
other enjoyable activities such as checking out Copia and the new
Oxbow Market (see “Napa excursions” later in this chapter), biking
down a sleepy road, or taking a spa treatment. You could also cut down
on your winery visits the first day and take advantage of whatever your
inn has to offer, such as a swimming pool, a garden walk, or just some
peace and quiet. On your second day, have a substantial breakfast and
consider one of the 11 a.m. reservation-only winery tours, such as the
one at Benziger. To occupy any extra time you may have in your sched-
ule, there’s always outlet shopping in Napa and along Highway 29 past
St. Helena.
Creating a wine-tasting itinerary isn’t easy, because there are so many
vineyards to choose from. The wineries suggested in this chapter are
great for first-time tasters, because they make a special effort to accom-
modate visitors. These vineyards offer some combination of tours,
exhibits, and extra-friendly staffs. But there are plenty more vineyards to
choose from, so get a map of the area and, time permitting, explore
those back roads.
Touring the wineries on your own
For wine-tasting newbies, the first winery you visit should be one that
offers an in-depth tour, so you can familiarize yourself with the wine-
making process. If you’re traveling from north to south, Sterling
Vineyards in Calistoga is a good bet, as is Robert Mondavi Winery in
Oakville. In Sonoma, the tram operators at Benziger Family Winery are
both knowledgeable and accessible.
If you’re already somewhat of a connoisseur, ask your local wine mer-
chant to suggest smaller wineries that you may enjoy.
Napa Valley is home to more than 380 wineries (Sonoma has around 250),
some owned by corporations and others by individuals so seduced by
the grape that they abandoned successful careers to devote themselves
to viticulture (the cultivation of grapes). Although there’s no correlation
between the size of a winery and the quality of the product — which has
more to do with the talents of the vintners (winemakers) and variables
such as weather and soil conditions than with size — the bigger wineries
offer more to visitors in terms of education and entertainment.
You can greatly enhance your knowledge of wine by tasting correctly —
and what better classroom than a French-style château smack in the
middle of a vineyard? Remember that wine appreciation begins by ana-
lyzing color, followed by aroma, then taste. You do this with your eyes
first, then your nose, then your mouth. Don’t be shy about asking ques-
tions of the person pouring — he or she will cheerfully explain all,
because the more you discover about the product, the more likely you
are to become a steady customer. And that makes everybody happy!
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
230

You won’t be able to get a deal on wine that you purchase directly from
the wineries. They sell their wines at the full retail price so as not to
undercut their primary market, the wine merchants. If you can’t get a
particular vintage at home, most wineries may be able to mail-order it
for you (depending on the laws in your home state).
Wineries in Napa Valley
Wineries in Napa (less so in Sonoma) are developing new ways to market
wine tasting as an educational and culinary event — and an expensive
one at that. In what I think is an effort to eradicate the notion that this is
a great way to cadge free alcohol, most wineries charge at least a nomi-
nal tasting fee, and many promote sit-down food and wine pairings for
real money. Rubicon Estate (formerly Niebaum-Coppola) is a case in
point; you can’t even drive onto the property without paying $25 per
adult at the gate, just so they know you really, really want to be there
(the fee covers a tour and five tastes). Wine tasting has become very
serious business in these parts.
Start in Calistoga and work your way down the valley along Highway 29
to make your return to San Francisco a bit shorter. But don’t take this
drive on a summer weekend. The bumper-to-bumper traffic on Highway
29 will ruin your day.
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 231
Becoming a wine connoisseur: 
The basics
Cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir, and zinfandel grapes (grown for red wines), and
chardonnay and sauvignon or fumé blanc grapes (grown for white wines), are the
most prominent grape varieties produced in the area. Telling the difference between
them takes a great deal of knowledge. Each one of these varieties contains identifiable
flavors and aromas you can only begin to recognize through careful sipping.
Reading the label on the bottle is the best way to tell the difference between caber-
net and pinot. The label identifies the type of grape used if the wine contains at least
75 percent of that variety, as well as other bits of information. The appellation of origin
indicates where the grapes were grown. The label may state that the grapes were
grown in either a viticulture area, such as the Carneros region of Napa Valley, in a cer-
tain county, or just in the state itself. Check the vintage date, which explains when at
least 95 percent of the grapes were crushed. Many wines taste better aged, and some
years produce better grapes than others.

Beaulieu Vineyard
At this well-regarded, hospitable establishment, the vintners pass out
glasses of sauvignon blanc as you walk in, to get you in the mood. After
you’ve enjoyed a glass, you can take a free half-hour tour of the production
facility, open daily from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Each tasting thereafter is $5, or
$25 for five delicious reserve vintages.

Clos Pegase
The official tour takes only about 30 minutes and begins at 11 a.m. and 
2 p.m. You can spend the rest of your time at this winery joyfully studying
the art collection, walking around the sculpture garden, or picnicking on
the vast lawn. You need to reserve a picnic table, but reservations aren’t
required for the complimentary tour. Wine tasting is $2.50 for current
releases and $2 each for reserve wines.

Wine tasting do’s and don’ts
When you taste wines, keep in mind the following suggestions and you’ll fit right in —
even if it’s your first time:
 Before the pour, sniff your glass. It should have a clean aroma.
 Do not pour the wine yourself. Winery staff will pour it for you.
 Taste wines in the appropriate order. Whites first, reds second, and dessert wines
last.
 Swirl the wine to coat the inside of the glass. Swirling introduces more oxygen
and helps open up the wine flavors and aromas.
 Smell the wine. Notice the different aromas — spice, fruit, flowers.
 Take a sip and cover the back of your tongue with the wine.
 Taste, then spit. Wine tasting is one of the few sports where spitting is not only
allowed, it’s encouraged. (Just make sure you hit your target, a bucket, or some
other container available for this purpose.) Tasting, then spitting, is also a nifty way
to sample many wines without becoming cloudy-headed.
 Do not bring a bottle of wine from one winery into another.

Darioush
A Persian palace (think Persepolis) in Napa? No, you haven’t had one too
many, you’ve found Darioush. This eye-catching — to say the least —
building, clad in travertine stone mined in Iran, opened in 2004; the winery
has been producing since 1997. Tastings cost $20 for a flight of five wines.
If it’s available, try the 2004 signature Chardonnay, which has an amazing
pear-ish, creamy consistency from start to finish. A wine and cheese tast-
ing ($50) starts daily at 2 p.m. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at 11 a.m.,
you can indulge in a two-hour tasting and tour of Darioush Khaledi’s pri-
vate wine cellar, including tidbits whipped up by his chef ($125 per
person).
4240 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558. % 707-257-2345. www.darioush.com. Open:
Daily 10:30 a.m.–5 p.m.
Robert Mondavi Winery
Mondavi was the first winery to conduct public tastings, and it continues to
take pride in educating people about wine. Tours range from the daily 75-
minute To Kalon option at $25 a pop (% 888-RMONDAVI, ext. 82001, for
same-day reservations) to the $100 Harvest of Joy, which includes a three-
course lunch. For fees ranging from $15 to $115, you can benefit from semi-
nars on grape growing, essence tasting, and wine and food pairing.
Reservations are required for tours and seminars. During July and August,
you can catch a Saturday evening concert. The shows sell out quickly, so
call % 888-769-5299 or visit Mondavi’s Web site for a schedule and tickets.
7801 St. Helena Hwy. (Highway 29), P.O. Box 106, Oakville, CA 94562. % 800-
RMONDAVI or 707-226-1395. www.robertmondavi.com. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–
5 p.m.
St. Supéry
Find out about aromas common to certain varietals with the self-guided
interactive tour featuring “SmellaVision.” You’ll also hear about growing
techniques at the winery’s demonstration vineyard. Have $15 on hand for
the tasting fee. On weekends, you can get a half-glass of the really good
stuff in the Divine Wine room (the reserve tasting room) for $20.
8440 St. Helena Hwy. (Highway 29), Rutherford, CA 94573. % 800-942-0809.
www.stsupery.com. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Sterling Vineyards
Arrive at this hilltop winery by aerial tram and swoon over the spectacu-
lar vista. The $20 ($10 for under 21s) ticket price includes wine tasting.
After you reach the winery, take the self-guided tour that leads you
through the entire operation and into the tasting room, where the friendly
staff serves wine at tables rather than at a bar. For grander palates, a $45

reserve tasting and guided tour starts at 11 a.m. daily. Plan on spending at
least one hour here.

10:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Sonoma Valley includes the towns of Sonoma, Glen Ellen, and Kenwood
and is a bit less popular than Napa Valley because of its smaller size.
Day-trippers may enjoy the relaxed, more intimate atmosphere of
Sonoma Valley. You can drive here in just over an hour, tour a few winer-
ies, shop, have a great meal, and be back in the city — traffic willing —
in time for dinner. You may choose to spend the night, in which case you
can find many B&Bs and hotels, plus a few resorts sprinkled around the
country roads.
Enter the Sonoma Valley on Highway 121, then turn north on Highway
12. This path takes you directly into the charming town of Sonoma. 
(If you want to go directly to Glen Ellen, take Highway 116 instead.)
This tour includes stops at some smaller wineries that are too delicious
to miss; all provide a little wine education and tastings. You’ll see coun-
try roads bedecked by acres of grapes, old oaks, and flowers. And
although the destinations are noteworthy, the drive alone is splendid.
Arrowood Vineyards & Winery
Arrowood is an intimate, high-end, somewhat exclusive winery with small
production but national distribution. You need an appointment for daily
40- to 90-minute tours, which cost $20 to $30. Call a day or two in advance.
If you don’t care for a tour, you can still sit on the verandah overlooking
grapevines and mountains and try some great wines. The tasting fee is $3.
14347 Sonoma Hwy., Glen Ellen, CA 95442. % 800-938-5170 or 707-938-5170. www.
arrowoodvineyards.com. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Benziger Family Winery
Tractor-pulled trams take visitors up the flower-lined path of this 85-acre
ranch on a 45-minute tour ($15 per adult; $5 under 21; reservations
required). The winery, owned by the Benziger family since 1981, is near
Jack London State Historic Park. The tram operators enthusiastically
explain how vines work, how insects are controlled, and how the sun and
soil together affect the taste of the wine. You can choose from two tasting
opportunities: $10 for six tastings of that day’s vintners’ choices, or $15
for reserve wines.
1883 London Ranch Rd., Glen Ellen, CA 95442. % 888-490-2739. www.benziger.
com. Take Highway 12 to Arnold Drive and turn left on London Ranch Road. Open:
Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 235

B. R. Cohn Winery
Cohn’s tasting room, gift shop, and picnic area flanked by olive trees are
just down the road from Arrowood. Tasting fees are a modest $5 for cur-
rent releases and $10 for limited release wines, including the signature
2002 Olive Hill Estate Cabernet. Along with the wines, some of which are
available only at the winery, the olive oil produced here is of the highest
quality and makes a great gift. Friendly staff members who are happy to
talk wine and olives preside over the relaxed tasting room. Doobie
Brothers music plays on the speakers and is available in the gift shop
because owner Bruce Cohn is their manager.
15000 Sonoma Hwy., Glen Ellen, CA 95442. % 800-330-4064. www.brcohn.com.
Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Moon Mountain Vineyard
A long drive up the mountain rewards visitors with stunning views and
some delicious organic estate wines available only on-site. The tasting room
is inside a turret, too intimate to accommodate the busloads that reach
more accessible wineries. You’ll have a chance to ask questions while tour-
ing the tank room and caves or tasting the Bordeaux-style offerings. Fellow
tasters are likely to be serious wine students who have sought out one of
the less ostentatious yet sophisticated wineries in either Napa or Sonoma.
The tasting fee is just $10. You must make an appointment to visit.
1700 Moon Mountain Rd., Sonoma, CA 95476. % 707-996-5870. www.moon
mountainvineyard.com. Take Highway 12 toward Glen Ellen. Moon Mountain
Road is between Agua Caliente and Madrone roads. Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
by appointment.
Robledo Family Winery
The modest tasting room, comfortably furnished with handsome pieces
from Michoacan, Mexico, epitomizes the old-fashioned American success
story. Reynaldo Robledo, Sr., who arrived in the valley as a 16-year-old
migrant worker, combined hard work and a gift for nurturing grapevines
into ownership of three vineyards, a vineyard management company, and
this winery. His children are actively involved in the business, and you’ll
meet at least one behind the bar, pouring tastes of their estate Sauvignon
Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, and Merlot. A small producer, Robledo sells
the majority of its bottles directly to consumers through its wine club or
at the winery.
21901 Bonness Rd., Sonoma, CA 95479. % 707-939-6903. www.robledofamily
winery.com. Take Arnold Drive and turn on Highway 116 toward Petaluma. Open:
By appointment Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–4 p.m.
Taking advantage of other fun stuff in the valleys
Wine Country offers many other activities besides wine tasting. If you’re
staying overnight, be sure to check out the following sites, sports, and
downright sumptuous pleasures in Napa and Sonoma.

Napa excursions
Copia: The American Center for Wine, Food, and the Arts, 500 First St.,
Napa (% 707-259-1600; www.copia.org), opened in 2001 and quickly
became one of the valley’s must-see attractions. Copia celebrates the
finer things in life in a modern museumlike setting, but it’s neither
solemn nor overly reverential. One permanent exhibit, an interactive
presentation on the role of food and wine in American society, is accessi-
ble and amusing. In addition, there’s a state-of-the-art theater for con-
certs, lectures, and films. Copia offers a full roster of wine and food
courses year-round, and a 500-seat concert terrace overlooking the Napa
River, surrounded by orchard and organic gardens, provides warm-
weather amusement. A fine restaurant, Julia’s Kitchen (open: Mon–Sat
11:30 a.m.–3 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–3 p.m. for brunch, and daily 5–9:30 p.m.),
wine bar, and, of course, a gift shop round out the experience. Check the
Web site for programming during your trip, and try to take in an exhibit,
a class, a concert, or a meal — all four if time allows. Check the Web site
for prices; general admission is free. Open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Next door to Copia is the Oxbow Public Market, 610 First St., Napa 
(% 707-226-6529; www.oxbowpublicmarket.com), an upscale develop-
ment spearheaded by the same fellow who project-managed San
Francisco’s Ferry Plaza market. Open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (restau-
rants stay open later), it sells produce outside and prepared foods, wine,
cheeses, and gourmet gifts inside. Of particular note, especially for
people who can’t eat gluten, is Pica Pica, a vendor specializing is
Venezuelan maize breads filled with your pick of good stuff such as fried
plantains, skirt steak, cheese, smoked ham, and black beans. It’s the
future of fast food, I imagine. Oxbow Wine Merchant takes the place of a
day’s worth of winery visits: You can sit at the bar, order a flight of wine
from a vast list, add a variety of cheeses and a charcuterie plate, and
never see the need to move again. Finish up by tottering over to the
Three Twins organic ice cream counter (look for a very long line). Sure,
this ice cream will ruin your desire for just about any other ice cream in
the world, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention it.
Art turns up in the most unexpected places, but none more so than the
di Rosa Preserve (% 707-226-5991, ext. 25; www.dirosapreserve.org).
This is a 217-acre indoor/outdoor gallery 61⁄2 miles west of Napa on
Highway 121. It displays more than 2,000 works amid meadows, hanging
from trees, and throughout the former winery. Rene di Rosa, a former
journalist and viticulturist, owns the property. Guides conduct one-hour
introductory and 21⁄2-hour tours Tuesday through Saturday (reservations
required); admission is $10 and $15. Admission and tours are free on
Wednesday! Soaring over the vineyards under a colorful balloon, with
just a few other souls sharing your basket, is a breathtaking experience.
Bonaventura Balloon Company of Napa Valley (% 800-FLY-NAPA or
707-944-2822; www.bonaventuraballoons.com) is one of Napa’s most
trusted operators, with a range of packages from $198 per person. Or
call Napa Valley Aloft, Inc. (% 800-944-4408 or 707-944-4408; www.nva
loft.com), which offers early-morning lift-off, a preflight snack, and a
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
238

postflight brunch with bubbly. However, at $225 to $325 per person
(depending on the number of people and the extras you choose), you
may decide to keep those feet on the ground.
If you want to join the many bicyclists you see pedaling Napa’s scenic
roads, St. Helena Cyclery, 1156 Main St., St. Helena (% 707-963-7736;
www.sthelenacyclery.com), will set you on the Silverado Trail for $10
per hour or $30 per day. Getaway Adventures BHK (Biking, Hiking, and
Kayaking), 1117 Lincoln Ave., Calistoga (% 800-499-BIKE or
707-942-0332), runs day trips with lunch and winery tours.
Wind down after a busy day with a mud bath. People have been immers-
ing themselves in Calistoga mud for more than 150 years, but if you’re
prone to claustrophobia, get a massage only. You can reserve a tub and a
follow-up massage at Dr. Wilkinson’s Hot Springs Resort, 1507 Lincoln
Ave. (% 707-942-4102; www.drwilkinson.com); Indian Springs Resort
and Spa, 1712 Lincoln Ave. (% 707-942-4913; www.indianspring
scalistoga.com); or Calistoga Spa Hot Springs, 1006 Washington St.
(% 707-942-6269). A mud bath and 50-minute massage is $200 at Indian
Springs, and you get use of the pool.
Hop on the city of Napa’s free downtown trolley for a 40-minute tour or a
ride to Copia (see listing above), the local outlet mall, or other stops.
Trolley routes and times vary by day. Monday through Wednesday trol-
leys run every 45 minutes from 11 a.m. to 7:53 p.m. Thursday through
Saturday, two trolley loops operate every 30 minutes: The Red Loop
runs from 11 a.m. to 7:57 p.m., and the Green Loop runs from 11:15 a.m.
to 8:12 p.m. On Sunday the trolley runs every 45 minutes from 11 a.m. 
to 7:53 p.m. Find a trolley stop at First and Main streets. Call % 707-255-
7631 for more info.
Sonoma activities
Massage therapists abound in the valley, many of them well trained at
the California Institute of Massage and Spa Services, 772 W. Napa St.
(% 707-939-9431), near the Sonoma Plaza. This is not a fancy facility,
but the treatment rooms are comfortable, clean, and quiet. A 60-minute
therapeutic massage is currently $80.
Olives are also an important crop in Wine Country, and olive oil tastings
have become a popular activity. You can debate the merits of various
extra-virgin olive oils at the Olive Press, 24724 Arnold Dr. (% 800-965-
4839; www.theolivepress.com), which shares digs with the Jacuzzi
Family Vineyards Winery. The press runs 24 hours between October and
February. Watch the process from the tasting room while sampling
award-winning olive oil and browsing olive-themed merchandise.
Jack London State Historic Park, 2400 London Ranch Rd. (% 707-938-
5216; www.jacklondonpark.com), is where the prolific author of The
Call of the Wild lived before his death in 1916 at age 40. You can walk on
trails to the ruins of Wolf House, London Lake, and Bath House, and visit
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 239

the recently restored cottage, which displays first editions of London’s
works and some of his and his wife’s personal memorabilia. It’s a gor-
geous place for a hike. Open daily from 9:30 a.m. to dusk. The park
charges a $6-per-vehicle entrance fee.
The Goodtime Touring Co. (% 888-525-0453 or 707-938-0453; www.good
timetouring.com) meets customers off the Sonoma Plaza to embark on
guided 41⁄2-hour picnic/winery rides for $125, which includes lunch and
tasting fees. Bike rentals alone are also available for $25 to $45 per day.
If you have an intense interest in food, sign up for a three- to four-hour
class at Ramekins, 450 W. Spain St. (% 707-933-0450; www.ramekins.
com), a small B&B and culinary school next to the General’s Daughter
restaurant. During the day, take in the demonstration classes; then in the
evening, glean culinary tips from some major Bay Area chefs. Students
have lots of opportunities to sample the goods with a few glasses of
wine. Call for a catalog. You can register over the phone, in person, or on
the Web.
Spending the night
Although country inns and bed-and-breakfasts interspersed with spas
and motels dot both valleys, supply and demand keep room rates and
occupancy on the high side. Even if you plan to look for a hotel in San
Francisco at the last minute, you need to make reservations in the Wine
Country as far in advance as possible, especially for stays between May
and October. Most lodgings have a two-night minimum on the weekends
during the high season. The good news: Parking is free at all the accom-
modations I list in this section.
Here is a breakdown of what the dollar signs represent in the following
hotel listings (Note: This is a slightly different scale from San Francisco
proper.):
 $: Under $150
 $$: $151 to $225
 $$$: $226 to $300
 $$$$: Over $300
Finding a substantial, well-prepared meal won’t be as hard as finding a
room, although you still need to make reservations. Some great chefs
have settled their lives and businesses around the valleys, perhaps real-
izing that well-to-do tourists and urbanites with second homes love to
eat out. Eating out is also one of the few evening activities in Wine
Country — there’s not much else to do after 10 p.m.
Contact the Napa Valley Conference & Visitors Bureau, 1310 Napa
Town Center, Napa, CA 94559 (% 707-226-7459; www.napavalley.com),
for information on accommodations.

The Sonoma Valley Visitors Bureau is on the Sonoma Plaza at 453 First

ity sheet listing hotel, B&B, and motel rooms in case you didn’t make
reservations.

Best Western Stevenson Manor Inn
$–$$$
Calistoga
Situated just east of town, this pleasant motel offers great value in an
expensive neighborhood. Rooms are motel basic, boosted a notch by fire-
places or whirlpool tubs, cable TV, fridges, coffeemakers, and hair dryers,
as well as on-property extras including a pool, hot tub, sauna, and steam
rooms. Guest rooms with two queen-size beds won’t crowd the family, and
kids under 12 stay free.

Harvest Inn
$$$–$$$$
St. Helena
Rooms in this Tudor-inspired complex are light, attractive, comfortable,
and roomy enough for a family. Two pools and two Jacuzzis sit in lovely
gardens against a dramatic backdrop of mountains and vineyards. Lots of
little luxuries help justify the price, including feather beds, fireplaces, CD
players, and VCRs. The midvalley location is central to everything.

Indian Springs
$$–$$$$
Calistoga
Each of these comfortable, old-fashioned bungalows has a kitchen with a
refrigerator and microwave, and picnic tables and barbecue grills are
nearby. Surreys (bikes with bench seats and awnings) and Ping-Pong tables
for guests to use enhance the resortlike atmosphere. Lounge chairs sur-
round a warm, Olympic-size mineral pool. The spa, which is in a 1913 bath-
house, offers a full range of services with experienced practitioners.
Booking a bungalow in the summer isn’t easy, but try edging out the fam-
ilies who come here year after year by calling 48 hours ahead to find out
whether you can get in on a cancellation. Rooms in the lodge just aren’t as
delightful.

The Inn on First
$$$–$$$$
Napa
Downtown Napa has a good selection of B&Bs in converted Victorians, and
this family-run inn is among the best. It’s a smart choice for couples seek-
ing a little romance who also want a location that’s close to restaurants
and whatever nightlife is available. The Inn on First has a total of ten indi-
vidually designed TV-free rooms, five in the mansion and five in a slightly
more private new building in the garden. The focal points are the cushy
beds and in-room Jacuzzis (heart-shaped in the Poppy suite), just so you
understand in what direction you’re headed. In the heat of the summer, a
more resortlike hotel with a pool would probably be preferable, but in
snuggling weather, the Inn on First provides nearly everything you need.

Milliken Creek Inn & Spa
$$$$
Napa
Cushy, chic, and romantic, the airy, large rooms in this intimate inn resem-
ble photos out of Metropolitan Home. No luxury is overlooked, from Frette
bed linens and L’Occitane bath products to candlelight turndown service.
The 3-acre creekside gardens are equally stunning and private; you’ll find
it difficult to tear yourself away, although many excellent small wineries
await along the Silverado Trail.

Vintage Inn
$$$–$$$$
Yountville
This big, attractive French-country inn is near some of the finest restau-
rants in the valley. Decorated in French Renaissance style, rooms are clus-
tered throughout the lovely flowering grounds and are equipped with
fireplaces, fridges, Jacuzzi tubs, and coffeemakers. Tennis courts and a
heated pool make this a comfortable miniresort, good for couples explor-
ing the area. Spa services are available next door at the Villagio, the sister
inn. Check for specials and packages, which can make this a relative 
bargain.

El Pueblo Inn
$–$$$
Sonoma
Here’s a lovable, way-better-than-average motel almost within walking dis-
tance of the Sonoma Plaza, and very well located for touring. Family-owned
and -run, it has a really nice vibe and very comfortable, spacious rooms in
the buildings closest to reception. (The corner units there have fireplaces.)
Guest rooms in the original two-story building in the back are less expen-
sive, and bathrooms are older and smaller. A pretty garden and pool sit
next to a shaded patio and fitness room; it could get noisy in the summer,
because the property is right along Highway 12. If I had the kids along, I’d
stay here without question. And if I was seeking affordable lodgings, ditto.

Inn at Sonoma
$$–$$$
Sonoma
This attractive member of the Four Sisters Inns chain offers terrific value.
Public and guest rooms are graciously decorated and smartly maintained,
and rates include a generous breakfast, afternoon happy hour, and cook-
ies. With just 19 rooms, the Inn at Sonoma offers as much attention as you
require from the staff. Booking a room in summer will take planning,
because this is a popular destination for wedding parties. Less than 2
blocks from the Sonoma Plaza, the location makes walking to dinner a
simple treat. For romantic occasions, I’d prefer a more secluded and lux-
urious hideaway such as the Kenwood Inn or Milliken Creek; otherwise, a
room here more than satisfies.
630 Broadway, Sonoma. % 888-568-9818 or 707-939-1340. Fax: 707-996-5227. www.
innatsonoma.com. Rack rates: $165–$270 double. Rates include full breakfast,
afternoon wine, and bike rentals. MC, V.
Kenwood Inn and Spa
$$$$
Kenwood
If price is no object, or you want an all-out splurge, this gorgeous inn —
reminiscent of villas on the Italian Riviera — is my pick over any hotel in
either valley. The faux-painted buildings appear almost miragelike as you
drive up the Sonoma Highway, the pale yellow stucco blending into the
landscape on a sunny day. When you step inside, you’ll have no desire to
leave. Rooms are fitted with wood-burning fireplaces, feather beds, and
sensuous fabrics, and the facilities — an inviting saline pool, a separately
situated Jacuzzi, cozy bar and cafe (for guests only), and spa rooms that
overlook vineyards — guarantee a feeling of sublime, luxurious seclusion.

MacArthur Place
$$$$
Sonoma
This divine small hotel is a renovated Victorian connected to newer build-
ings. The rooms are spacious and comfy, with four-poster beds that’ll make
you think twice about getting up. Contented guests relax at the small, well-
staffed spa where the practiced hands of a masseuse work out pre-vaca-
tion tension. Manicured gardens surround a swimming pool, and a
steakhouse restaurant in the 100-year-old barn supplies room service.

Sonoma Chalet
$$–$$$
Sonoma
Although all you see from this Swiss-inspired farmhouse inn are mountains
and the ranch next door, it’s less than a mile from the Sonoma town square.
Antiques and collectibles decorate the three delightful, spacious cottages.
Inside the farmhouse, the upstairs rooms have private facilities, while the
two downstairs rooms share a bathroom. The simple and delicious break-
fast includes fresh pastries.

Dining in the valleys
Wine tasting certainly isn’t the only reason to make the drive from San
Francisco to Wine Country: The food here is sublime. Picking and choos-
ing which dining rooms to include below almost hurt, but someone has
to make the tough decisions. I tend to lean toward the places locals sup-
port, because tourist-oriented restaurants don’t expect to see you again.
(And if you’re wondering why the French Laundry is missing, it’s because
reservations are nearly impossible to get; see Chapter 10 for one sugges-
tion if you’re in a gambling mood and feeling lucky.)

Ad Hoc
$$
Yountville
AMERICAN
This is Thomas Keller’s other local restaurant, and although it doesn’t
carry quite the same cachet as the French Laundry, at least you can get a
table here. Paying the bill won’t require a federal bailout, either. Every
night and at Sunday brunch, Ad Hoc serves a four-course meal family style.
A typical spring menu may include frisée salad with pickled veggies, flat-
iron steak and shrimp accompanied by local corn, Cowgirl Creamery
cheese, then beignets for dessert. Delicious, homey food combined with
the wonderful atmosphere and enthusiastic staff adds up to an experience

Angèle
$$–$$$
Napa
FRENCH BISTRO
Napa is experiencing a major growth spurt in hotels and especially restau-
rants, and few have more to recommend them than this warm, casual
brasserie overlooking the Napa River. Part of the historic Hatt Building
development, Angèle serves typical French fare as interpreted by a chef
with access to the bounty of Northern California. My perfectly cooked
pavé de boeuf haché (yes, a hamburger) may not have been the most chal-
lenging selection, but it sure hit the spot one winter evening when a heav-
ier meal would only have led to gout. My dining companions ate every
scrap of their succulent pan-seared scallops and tender veal stew. A high
level of professionalism at every turn makes this spot a standout.

Share a pizza, some antipasti, and a bottle of chardonnay for a delightful,

sons, attracts a crowd that gathers at tables on the porch overlooking vine-

Much applauded around the Bay Area for its menu, authenticity, and viva-

Bounty Hunter Rare Wine & Provisions

Napa
AMERICAN
Foremost a wine shop, Bounty Hunter stocks a wealth of bottles to pair
with the first-rate Southwestern-influenced cooking that pretty much obvi-
ates the need to ever drive Highway 29 again. Surrounded by the best
wines available, your other difficult choice will be what to eat — grilled
whole chicken stuffed with Tecate beer? Barbecued ribs, smoky and suc-
culent? A plate groaning with artisan cheeses and meats? This cozy former
grocery in downtown Napa knows how to elevate dining into a rousing
good time.

Cindy’s Backstreet Kitchen
$$
St. Helena
CALIFORNIA
Cindy Pawlcyn (of Mustards Grill fame) opened this smaller, more low-key
eatery in 2001. St. Helena gets its fair share of weekend wine tasters, and
the way this two-story house feels like a neighborhood hangout is a testa-
ment to Pawlcyn’s sensibility. A table in the garden is the ideal spot for a
Cobb salad or curried chicken and something cold (there’s a full bar as
well as fresh juice drinks). In the evening, small plates, such as rabbit tosta-
dos or Piquillo peppers stuffed with cumin-scented beef, seem made for a
local lager. Large plates include specials from the wood-burning oven, fish
of the day, and steak frites that’ll have you hunkered over your dish. Use
one of Cindy’s root beer floats, featuring house-made vanilla ice cream, to
teach kids the difference between ordinary and extraordinary.

CLASSIC ITALIAN
This elegant (but not stuffy) restaurant is what people dream of when they
dream of eating in the Italian countryside. You have a choice of where to
take your meal — in the more formal dining room inside, or outside on the
lovely courtyard patio (probably the better spot if the kids are with you).
The Cantinetta delicatessen is the place to pick up wine and prepared
foods to eat at the bar or to take on a picnic. Nearby, at 1016 Main St., is
Tra Vigne Pizzeria, a favorite with local families craving spaghetti and
meatballs or thin-crusted pizzas in a more casual setting.

INTERNATIONAL
I like this pair of restaurants off the main drag for an unusual menu that
spans a good part of the globe. Start an international culinary tour with
spiced chickpea fritters and Vietnamese spring rolls, and then head to
South America with a Brazilian seafood stew, layered with flavors, or opt
for a soft landing in Italy over some tender osso buco. Wappo also has seat-
ing on a pretty patio that lies in between its two storefronts. A glass of
white wine, the Turkish mezze (appetizers) plate, and a table in the
warmth of a Napa Valley afternoon defines one version of happiness.

Cafe La Haye
$$
Sonoma
CALIFORNIA
This casual little cafe serves some of the best food around and, unlike
many other Wine Country restaurants, makes no attempt to pretend it’s in
Italy or France. Plain tables and chairs are carefully set about, as if not to
disturb the art that fills the walls, making La Haye’s single room resemble
a gallery. The menu, spare but complete, features whatever’s seasonal and
offers organic produce. The daily risotto is fabulous, but you can’t go
wrong no matter what you order.
140 E. Napa St., Sonoma. % 707-935-5994. www.cafelahaye.com. Reservations
advised. Main courses: $16–$25. AE, MC, V. Open: Tues–Sat from 5:30 p.m.
Deuce
$$
Sonoma
CALIFORNIA
With so many valley restaurants and chefs vying for attention, travelers
overlook Deuce, a popular stop for county residents. In the yellow
Craftsman-style house, which sits on the main road heading toward the
Sonoma Plaza, you’ll find especially friendly service and well-prepared
food that doesn’t require any translation. Lots of diners (especially those
who want dessert) make do with a couple of starters, in particular the
tender, crispy calamari or the irresistible lobster pot pie. For mains, the
smart money is on the thick, perfectly grilled pork chop, although it’s hard
to pass up the cassoulet. Kids are welcome here, and the kitchen will pre-
pare something to their liking if you ask.

advised. Main courses: $17–$24. AE, MC, V. Open: Sun–Thurs 11 a.m.–9 p.m., Fri–Sat

El Dorado Kitchen
$$$
Sonoma
CALIFORNIA
Anchoring the northwest corner of the square, EDK answers the question
of where to eat in hot weather when you want to dine outside. In the
winter, the restaurant’s open kitchen and communal table provide a dif-
ferent sort of warmth. It’s a joy to order a bottle of local vino, a charcu-
terie plate featuring house-made sausage, and another of olives and
hummus. Linger over excellent steamed mussels. If you can manage
another course, bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin served over garlic-
enhanced polenta is a dish worthy of New Orleans’ best. Desserts are also
gorgeous, so plan ahead: You’ll be sorry if you can’t manage the ice cream
sandwiches.

Garden Court Cafe and Bakery
$
Glen Ellen
AMERICAN
Get a modest plate of bacon and eggs and lunch to take out, or a tasty, fill-
ing breakfast that keeps you going most of the day. This is a completely
unpretentious diner where the regulars settle back with the paper and
coffee while waiting for gravy and biscuits. Atkins and South Beach dieters
have lots of egg dishes to choose from — hold the house-baked breads.
Well, maybe not; these are especially fine.

COUNTRY FRENCH
This upscale country French bistro moved to the Sonoma Hotel a few
years ago, adding outdoor dining to the delight of its admirers. The sea-
sonal menu meets the needs of seafoodies, vegetarians, and carnivores
with one or two dishes in each category. The grilled fig salad with arugula
and local goat’s cheese is a must when fresh figs are available.

Living It Up after
Dark: San Francisco
Nightlife

In this part . . . 
B
ecause San Francisco is home to such a diverse popula-
tion, no single form of entertainment has come to be
associated with the city in the same way as jazz with New
Orleans or theater with New York. Instead, San Francisco
offers an eclectic mix of dance, music, performance art, the-
ater, and opera, with plenty to choose from on any given
night. If you shun anything requiring a trip to a box ofﬁce, you
can choose from plenty of bars and clubs to keep you off the
streets until the wee hours.
Even travelers with kids don’t have to limit after-hours activi-
ties to dinner and a movie. A few clubs offer shows for
patrons of all ages, featuring local alternative or blues bands.
(Your kid will think you’re very special.) A night at the theater
is also a great family alternative; you can usually ﬁnd some-
thing that appeals to people of all ages.

Applauding the 
Cultural Scene
In This Chapter
 Finding out what’s going on in town when you’re here
 Getting tickets to concerts, theater, and other events
 Enjoying the major opera, ballet, theater, and classical music scenes
 Broadening your horizons with experimental theater and dance
 Dining before or after the show
W
hether you’re up for world-class classical music or experimental
theater, or pretty much anything in between, you can find it on
stage in San Francisco. In this chapter, I give you the overall picture,
then detail how to find out what’s going on and score tickets.
Getting the Inside Scoop
Performing-arts fans can find plenty of interesting offerings in San
Francisco. For drama, Broadway road companies drop into town, and
our own American Conservatory Theatre (ACT) regularly produces
works that are visually inspired and well acted. Opera is just as vibrant.
Although the great Enrico Caruso never returned to San Francisco after
the shock of the 1906 earthquake, plenty of other stars have aria’d their
way through town, raising the local opera company to world-class
heights. The San Francisco Symphony is in a similar league, and while
I’m bragging, I’d better mention the ballet. It, too, is as fine a company
as you’ll see anywhere. But don’t let the big brands sway you from
trying stages outside Civic Center, including Yerba Buena Gardens, and
smaller venues South of Market where experimental theater abounds.

Finding Out What’s Playing and 
Getting Tickets
On the Web, you can check sites such as Citysearch (http://san
francisco.citysearch.com) and the San Francisco Chronicle
(www.sfgate.com) for reviews and synopses; otherwise, follow your
instincts (and local recommendations) when you get here. You may
stumble onto something wonderful. If you’re looking for something out-
side the mainstream — and this is a fine place to find that — a month or
so before your trip, sign up for the e-mail list Flavorpill SF (sf.flavor
pill.net). The free weekly e-mail highlights the more elusive cultural
events around town, including films, concerts, and theater.
Here are a few other Web sites to check out for what’s happening now:
 www.sfbg.com: You can find the San Francisco Bay Guardian’s com-
plete entertainment listings online. Try this one first.
 www.sanfran.com: San Francisco, our very own monthly magazine,
is chock-full of arts and entertainment information.
 www.sfweekly.com: This is the Web site for SF Weekly, a great lefty
publication with provocative features, lots of local info, and
reviews.
For tickets to any theater, dance, symphony, or concert performance,
you can call the appropriate box office directly or head online and order
with a credit card (charges are nonrefundable if, for some reason, you
don’t show up). Around Civic Center, City Box Office, 180 Redwood St.,
Suite 100 (% 415-392-4400; www.cityboxoffice.com), sells tickets to
shows playing at the Nob Hill Masonic Center, Project Artaud Theater,
Herbst Theatre, and other lesser-known stages. If you arrive in town
without plans, visit TIX Bay Area (% 415-433-7827; www.theatrebay
area.org/tix) for half-price tickets to same-day performances (subject
to a $1–$3 service charge). TIX, which is also a BASS Ticketmaster
outlet, is on Union Square between Post and Geary streets. It’s open
Tuesday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday and Saturday
until 7 p.m., and Sunday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Don’t buy tickets from anyone outside TIX or a box office claiming to
have discounted or scalper tickets, especially to sporting events. Folks
get duped all the time, forking over real cash for counterfeit tickets.
Another common scam is to sell tickets to an event that has already
taken place.
The concierge at your hotel can be a source for hard-to-get tickets. The
larger the hotel, the more likely it is that the concierge will be success-
ful, but in any case, it’s worth asking. If he or she does manage to come
through, a $5 to $10 tip is appropriate.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: San Francisco Nightlife 
252

If you’re flexible about your plans for the evening, pick a show and go to
the theater box office to stand in line awaiting last-minute cancellations
by season-ticket holders or the release of tickets held for media or VIPs.
With luck, you can land seats in the orchestra. Without luck, you’ll have
wasted an hour or so.
Don’t be late to the theater, symphony, or opera. Curtains rise on time,
and if you’re late, you won’t be seated until there’s a break in the action.
If you’re attending a show at the Geary Theater, avoid the boxes on
either side. The sightlines obscure half the stage, generally the half
where the action takes place.
As for what to wear, you’ll see a little of everything, from tailored
evening clothes to jeans. People seem to dress up a bit more Friday and
Saturday nights, especially in the orchestra seats, but your Sunday best
isn’t necessary.
Raising the Curtain on the Performing Arts
Cable cars will get you to Union Square theaters if you’re coming from
North Beach; from the Marina or Union Street, take a 30-Stockton or 45-
Union/Stockton bus. If you prefer to take a cab to your lodgings after-
ward, walk to a big hotel to catch one. You can find a number of parking
garages near Union Square. They charge at least $10 for the evening.
You can reach Civic Center, where the opera, ballet, and symphony per-
form, by any Muni Metro streetcar or any bus along Van Ness Avenue. I
wouldn’t walk around this area unescorted after dark to get back to the
Muni station, and taxis aren’t always immediately available. If you feel

stuck, walk to one of the many nearby restaurants and ask the host to
call a taxi for you. Relax, and prepare to wait awhile at the bar. If you’re
driving, you can park in the garage on Grove Street between Franklin and
Gough streets.
South of Market and Mission neighborhood venues have troubles simi-
lar to Civic Center’s. You can usually get to the performance by public
transportation, but returning late at night by bus is less interesting 
(or perhaps more interesting, depending on your perspective). Again, if
you’re attending a show in this area, don’t expect a cab to materialize
afterward. Instead, walk to a nearby restaurant or bar and call. These
numbers for local cab companies can help:
 Desoto Cab: % 415-970-1300
 Luxor Cabs: % 415-282-4141
 Pacific: % 415-986-7220
 Veteran’s Cab: % 415-648-1313
 Yellow Cab: % 415-626-2345
I would never seriously compare our little theater district to the Great
White Way in New York, but San Francisco has a fair number of profes-
sional stages. At least ten of varying sizes cluster around Union Square,
and experimental theaters dot the South of Market and Mission districts
in converted warehouses and gallery spaces. Productions may include a
musical or two, distinguished classics, and world-premiere comedies
and dramas.
The American Conservatory Theater (ACT), the preeminent company
in town, produces a wide variety of plays during its season, which runs
October to June. The acting is first-rate, and the costumes and sets are
universally brilliant. The choice of material ranges from new works by
playwrights such as Tom Stoppard, can’t-lose American chestnuts, and
Shakespeare, all the way to not-quite-ready-for-prime-time dramas that
still receive a careful rendering. The lovely Geary Theater, 415 Geary St.,
at Mason Street (% 415-749-2228; www.act-sfbay.org), is home to
ACT productions. Ticket prices range from $17 to $82, and the box office
is open every day from noon until showtime (6 p.m. on nonperformance
days).
Broadway hits and road shows appear down the block at the Curran
Theater, 445 Geary St., between Mason and Taylor streets; the Golden
Gate Theater, 1 Golden Gate Ave., at Market Street; and the Orpheum,
1192 Market St., at Eighth Street. All three share one phone number and
Web site (% 415-551-2000; www.shnsf.com), and the recorded message
explains what’s playing, where to buy tickets, and how to get to the 
theaters.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: San Francisco Nightlife 
256

You may like your theater a little more cutting-edge. If so, check out the
Magic Theatre, Fort Mason Center, Building A (% 415-441-8822; www.
magictheatre.org), where David Mamet premiered his adaptation of
Dr. Faustus. Tickets range from $26 to $52, with great “day-of” discounts.
Or try Intersection for the Arts, a 72-seat performance space in the
Mission District at 446 Valencia St., between 15th and 16th streets 
(% 415-626-3311; www.theintersection.org). You won’t find any-
thing traditional in the exhibits, literary series, music, or interdiscipli-
nary works of art. Tickets cost $9 to $15.
The Magic Theatre sets aside a limited number of tickets for “Sliding
Scale” Wednesdays. Prices range from $5 to $25, and reservations aren’t
accepted; it’s first-come, first-served at the box office (open: Tues–Sat
noon to 5 p.m.), cash only.
The Lorraine Hansberry Theatre, 620 Sutter St. (% 415-474-8800;
www.lhtsf.org), features dramas and musicals by black authors past
and present such as Langston Hughes and August Wilson. Ticket prices
are $25 to $36. If you are in town during December, don’t miss the holi-
day gospel show, Black Nativity.
Another Union Square stage is tucked inside the building that houses the
Kensington Park Hotel, 450 Post St. The Post Street Theatre (formerly
Theatre on the Square) opened with the rock ’n’ roll musical Buddy: The
Buddy Holly Story and recently played host to the fabulous Dame Edna.
The nearby Marines Memorial Theatre, on the second floor of the
Marines’ Memorial Club, 609 Sutter St., is similar in size and flavor to the
Post Street Theatre. The two share a box office number and Web site
(% 415-771-6900; www.unionsquaretheatres.com).
Close to Civic Center, in an impressive former Masonic temple built in
1911, is the New Conservatory Theater Center at 25 Van Ness Ave., a
half block off Market Street (% 415-861-8972; www.nctcsf.org). NCT,
which consists of three small theaters, presents a variety of productions
throughout the year. April through August is “Pride Season,” during
which a series of six plays with gay themes is presented. NCT also pro-
duces children’s theater programming all year.
Admirers of musical theater should keep an eye out for productions by
42nd Street Moon (% 415-255-8207; www.42ndstmoon.org). The com-
pany presents long-forgotten American musicals in concert format and
gives audiences an opportunity to hear delightfully clever tunes that
somehow “disappeared.” Check ahead for shows and dates. Productions
take place at the Eureka Theatre, 215 Jackson St., at Battery Street in
the Financial District (% 415-978-2787).
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 257

Symphony and Opera
San Francisco has many venues for listening to classical music. Local
papers and Web sites are your best source for event listings. You can see
major groups such as the San Francisco Symphony, which performs in
the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, 201 Van Ness Ave., at Grove Street
(% 415-864-6000), in Civic Center. The season runs from September
through July, and tickets cost $25 to $130. Also at Civic Center is the
Herbst Theater, 410 Van Ness Ave. (% 415-621-6600), home to San
Francisco Performances (www.performances.org) and other profes-
sional groups.
You can also enjoy piano and violin duos, chamber music ensembles, and
singers at Old First Presbyterian Church, 1751 Sacramento St., at Van
Ness Avenue (% 415-474-1608; www.oldfirstconcerts.org). These
less formal concerts take place in the afternoon and evening, and tickets
are a mere $9.60 to $14. The California Street cable car takes you to
within 2 blocks of the church. If you’re around Yerba Buena Gardens at
lunchtime on Wednesday, head to St. Patrick’s Church, 756 Mission St.,
where Noontime Concerts (% 415-777-3211; www.noontimeconcerts.
org) produces half-hour concerts. These brief shows may be solo or full
orchestral performances. Admission is $5. Noontime Concerts also uses
the A. P. Giannini Auditorium at the Bank of America headquarters, 555
California St., in the Financial District. Concerts currently take place
every Tuesday, but call for an updated schedule.
The San Francisco Opera opens its season with a gala in September and
ends quietly in early January. It plays at the War Memorial Opera
House, 301 Van Ness Ave., at Grove Street (% 415-864-3330), in Civic
Center. Tickets run from $15 to $290. Pocket Opera (% 415-972-8934;
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: San Francisco Nightlife 
258
Pre- and post-theater dining
You have plenty of dining choices before attending any 8 p.m. performance. After the
show, however, your dining choices are more limited. On Union Square, a branch of
the Cheesecake Factory graces the eighth floor of Macy’s. It’s open until 11 p.m.
Farmer Brown, 25 Mason St., at Turk Street (% 415-409-3276), next to the Hotel
Metropolis, serves a Southern-leaning menu featuring succulent fried chicken until
midnight. If you’re attending an event around Civic Center and want to eat before the
show, be sure to make reservations. The Hayes Street Grill (see Chapter 10) originally
opened to accommodate the culture crowd, paving the way for a great many more
restaurants on and around Hayes Street. Down around Yerba Buena Center, Bacar,
448 Brannan St., between Third and Fourth streets (% 415-904-4100), has an extensive
wine list and serves tempting small and large plates. XYZ at the W Hotel, 181 Third St.,
at Howard Street (% 415-817-7836), has a cafe as well as a restaurant, so you can go
casual or upscale, depending on how quickly you need to eat.

www.pocketopera.org) delivers opera to the masses in stripped-down,
English-language versions that are quite entertaining and highly profes-
sional. The season begins in February and ends in June; productions
take place at different locations, including the Palace of the Legion of
Honor.
Dance
Plenty of classical and modern dance groups raise the barre in San
Francisco, the San Francisco Ballet being the best-known company. The
season runs from February to June, and performances are at the War
Memorial Opera House, 301 Van Ness Ave., at Grove Street. Call % 415-
865-2000 for tickets. Prices run from $10 for standing room to over $100
for orchestra seats. Students, seniors (68-plus), and military personnel
qualify for discounted same-day tickets, at $10 to $20. You can check for
availability by phoning the box office.

You’ll find adventurous modern dance, performance art, and theater at
the Project Artaud Theater, 450 Florida St., at 17th Street (% 415-626-
4370; www.artaud.org), in the Mission District. Ticket prices are $20 or
less, depending on the day and type of show.
Some of the most interesting dance companies, including Smuin Ballets/
SF, appear on stage at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, 700 Howard
St. (% 415-978-2787; www.ybca.org). It’s easy to reach, and there are
many fine restaurants in the neighborhood for pre- or post-theater
supper.
New Langton Arts, a nonprofit, artist-run experimental performance
space in SoMa, may have an art show, a theater performance, video
pieces, or all three at the same time. Check it out at 1246 Folsom St.,
between Eighth and Ninth streets (% 415-626-5416; www.newlangton
arts.org). Gallery and box office hours are Tuesday through Saturday,
noon to 6 p.m.
You may not want to miss Beach Blanket Babylon, a San Francisco
ritual. The 90-minute musical revue is known for wildly imaginative hats
that seem to live lives of their own. The spectacle is so popular that
even after celebrating 35 years of poking fun at stars, politicians, and
San Francisco itself, the constantly updated shows always sell out.
Purchase tickets ($25–$80) through TIX or by mail at least three weeks in
advance (especially if you want to attend a weekend performance). You
must be 21 for evening shows; minors are admitted only for Sunday
matinees, when no liquor is sold. You can enjoy this spectacle in North
Beach at Club Fugazi, 678 Green St., between Powell Street and
Columbus Avenue (% 415-421-4222; www.beachblanketbabylon.com).
You’ve got to see it to believe it.
It’s not A Prairie Home Companion, but we make do with our own Bay
Area radio show broadcast live on Saturday morning from 10 to noon.
You can join the studio audience for host Sedge Thomson’s West Coast
Live (% 415-664-9500; www.wcl.org) and watch well-known writers,
local personalities, musicians, and even a staff naturalist have their say
(or flog their most recent masterpieces). The show broadcasts from the
Ferry Building or from Berkeley — check the Web site for a schedule.
Tickets are $15 in advance and $18 at the door; reservations are a good
idea. The shows are entertaining, informative, and a highly enjoyable
way to spend a morning.

Hitting the Clubs and Bars
In This Chapter
 Checking out the hippest clubs and bars for live music
 Moving and grooving at dance clubs
 Aiming for atmosphere
 Getting a good laugh
 Broadening your horizons at some unique establishments
O
ne thing I love about this city: There’s no end to the good times.
You can have a night at the theater, followed by a night hopping
through a few bars and clubs, followed by a night listening to great jazz.
There are so many places for drinking and dancing and socializing, you’ll
have no excuse (except maybe exhaustion) for staying in at night.
Livin’ It Up with Live Music
Bars, all of which by law must close from 2 to 6 a.m., are self-explanatory.
Clubs are a different story altogether. South of Market, dance clubs with
different styles and names may share the same space. For example, a
particular club may feature 1970s-revisited disco catering to the Velvet
Elvis crowd on Friday, and then play Gothic industrial “music” for body-
piercing aficionados on Monday. Take a careful look at the listings in SF
Weekly or Bay Guardian to know what you’re getting into. Most clubs
don’t get going until after 10 p.m., so plan to take cabs anywhere not
within walking distance of your hotel.
Finding some cool jazz
Yoshi’s Jazz Club, 1330 Fillmore St. (% 415-665-5600, www.yoshis.com),
which opened in 2007 in the revitalized Fillmore Heritage district near
Japantown, is an offshoot of an Oakland music fixture. The San Francisco
Yoshi’s brings an eclectic mix of jazz stalwarts (Herb Alpert and Nicholas
Payton, to name two) to town. Shows, which cater to all ages, sell out
quickly. The club generally schedules two sets nightly; if you have tickets
to the late show, you can enjoy a leisurely meal featuring delicious
Japanese food at Yoshi’s restaurant (see Chapter 10). An evening at this
handsome place will be a memorable night out.

Jazz at Pearl’s, 256 Columbus Ave., at Broadway (% 415-291-8255; www.
jazzatpearls.com), showcases the 17-piece big band Contemporary
Jazz Orchestra every Monday and local musicians the rest of the week. 
A smaller venue than Yoshi’s, the room has more of a ’30s supper-club
atmosphere, although you’ll want to eat elsewhere in North Beach.
Tickets are $15 to $30. Over in the Mission, the ever-cool Elbo Room,
647 Valencia St., near 17th Street (% 415-552-7788), blasts acid jazz for a
well-dressed younger crowd. On some nights, you can move to Latin and
funk bands. Cover starts at $5 upstairs; downstairs the bar has a fine
menu of microbrews and a couple of pool tables.
Feelin’ blue: Blues bars
The Boom Boom Room, 1601 Fillmore St., at Geary Street (% 415-673-
8000; www.boomboomblues.com), is open every night for dancing, cock-
tails, and jiving. Lines often form on the weekends, so it doesn’t hurt to
arrive early and sip your drink slowly. The cover charge varies depend-
ing on the night and the act; it generally ranges from free to $22. Check
the Web site for an events calendar.
Follow the crowds to The Saloon, 1232 Grant Ave., at Fresno Street near
Vallejo Street (% 415-989-7666), as your first stop on a walking tour of
North Beach blues bars. Johnny Nitro plays here Friday and Sunday
night. If you can manage to get inside, the cover is usually $4 to $5. Up
the block, check out the Lost and Found Saloon, 1353 Grant Ave.,
between Vallejo and Green streets (% 415-981-9557). It’s crowded on
weekend nights; there’s no cover. Grant & Green, 1371 Grant Ave. 
(% 415-693-9565), is the third in the North Beach blues triumvirate. No
cover here, either. If you’re looking for something a little less . . . real,
head over to Enrico’s, 504 Broadway, at Kearny Street (% 415-982-6223).
Revived and remodeled in 2007, this landmark continues to book live
music nightly.
During the day, Pier 23, the Embarcadero, at Front Street (% 415-362-
5125), serves lunch to fashionable business executives on the patio. At
night, hot local blues and funk musicians, honky-tonk pianists, or ska
bands play for fans ages 21 to 70. The cover is $5 to $10 on weekends.
Catching the big-name acts
You’ll want to contact the box office directly or purchase tickets from
BASS (% 415-776-1999) for major musical acts. Ticket prices vary at the
following clubs, depending on the performers.
The Great American Music Hall, 859 O’Farrell St., near Polk Street 
(% 415-885-0750; www.musichallsf.com), books everything from
rhythm and blues to Cajun bands to Grammy Award–winning artists
such as Bonnie Raitt. Although you’ll notice the club isn’t in a squeaky-
clean neighborhood, safety isn’t a problem because so many people are
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: San Francisco Nightlife 
264

going in and out. If you’re driving, use the valet in front (if available) or
park in the AMC 1000 garage across the street. Take a cab home after the
show if you aren’t driving. You can find the club schedule and order tick-
ets on the Web site.
It won’t be the Grateful Dead, but you can find out who’s playing The
Fillmore, 1805 Geary St., at Fillmore Street, by checking out its Web site
(www.thefillmore.com) or by calling the box office at % 415-346-6000.
A pilgrimage here for die-hard rock ’n’ roll fans really is meaningful. The
SF Weekly Warfield, 982 Market St. (% 415-567-2060), is a huge theater
that books big-time musicians, mostly rock ’n’ roll. Slim’s, 333 11th St.,
between Folsom and Harrison streets (% 415-255-0333; www.slims-sf.
com), is a smaller, fairly comfortable club owned by singer Boz Scaggs,
who plays here every now and then. A much bigger room that some
grown-ups I know find extra palatable is Bimbo’s 365 Club, 1025
Columbus Ave., at Chestnut Street, in North Beach (% 415-474-0365;
www.bimbos365club.com). It’s a ’30s-style ballroom with an ornate bar
and an attendant in the ladies’ restroom. Music varies from rock to alter-
native. You can check the schedule on the Web site. Bottom of the Hill,
1233 17th St., at Texas Street (% 415-621-4455; www.bottomofthehill.
com), is a 300- to 500-capacity venue that caters to nationally known
indie rock acts with special appeal to the demographic that listens to
college radio. This Potrero Hill club also serves bar and grill food.
Smokers are allowed to puff on the patio. You can get there on the 22-
Fillmore or 19-Polk bus. My sources in the music biz inform me that 
The Independent, 628 Divisadero St., between Grove and Hayes streets
(% 415-771-1421; www.theindependentsf.com), has the best sound
system in the city and books the hottest indie and pop bands. The
schedule is online; entrance runs from free with a two-drink minimum 
to $25.
Shakin’ Your Groove Thang: Dance Clubs
The Ramp, 855 China Basin, off Third Street at Mariposa Street (% 415-
621-2378; www.ramprestaurant.com), is an indoor/outdoor bar/restau-
rant serving salads, burgers, breakfast, and perhaps the best views over
the water. Between May and October you can dance to live music on the
weekend; Saturday features salsa bands, and Sunday brings world music
(both days 5–8 p.m.). There’s no cover charge. The ultracool but friendly
Cafe du Nord, below the Swedish American Hall, 2170 Market St., at
Sanchez Street (% 415-861-5016; www.cafedunord.com), is a basement-
level club and restaurant that features indie bands or some type of live
music almost every evening. Cover runs from $10 to $20. Some shows
admit under-21 bohemians accompanied by adults. DNA Lounge, 375
11th St., at Harrison Street (% 415-626-1409; www.dnalounge.com),
may be blasting metal, gothic, hip-hop, synth pop . . . whatever . . . on
different nights of the week. Cover ranges from free to $15.
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 265

Swing, salsa, tango, and ballroom dancers, and those who’ve never com-
pletely let go of their Ginger Rogers fantasies, can dip to their hearts’
content at Cheryl Burke Dance, 1830 17th St. (% 415-252-9000; www.
cherylburkedance.com). You can swoop by at 8 p.m. to take a class,
and then stay for a dance party on Friday, Saturday, or alternate
Sundays, or simply arrive at 9 p.m. to trip the light fantastic. This is
strictly a social dancing venue; only snacks and nonalcoholic beverages
are available. The cover charge is $8 to $15. Already have your moves
down? The Top of the Mark in the InterContinental Mark Hopkins hotel,
1 Nob Hill (% 415-616-6916; www.topofthemark.com), with its surround-
sound view, is one of the prettiest rooms in the city. Tables ring the
dance floor, and a six-piece band plays ’40s dance tunes on Friday and
Saturday night. Cover is $5–$10 — or you can go all out and eat dinner
here, too.
Local nightlife encompasses much more than South of Market dance
halls. For a little fiesta in the Mission District, reserve a seat on El
Voladote, the Mexican Bus (www.mexicanbus.com), as it cruises the
dance clubs Friday and Saturday nights. The $38 ticket price includes
cover charges at three clubs. Call % 415-546-3747 for reservations two
or three weeks ahead. Salsa dancing is all the rage, and the place to take
a lesson or just sit back watching expert couples heat up the expansive
dance floor is Roccapulco, 3140 Mission St., at Precita Street (% 415-
648-6611; www.roccapulco.com). Ten dollars gets you a two-hour
lesson Monday or Wednesday at 7 p.m., or a one-hour class Friday or
Saturday at 8:30 p.m. Live Latin bands play Friday and Saturday from 
10 p.m., and Mexican specialties are available to keep your energy up.
You’ll want to dress the part here.
Sunday afternoons in the Mission call out for a cerveza on the patio at 
El Rio, 3158 Mission St. (% 415-282-3325; www.elriosf.com), where
they pack ’em in for salsa parties ($8 admission after 3 p.m.). The rest of
the week you might find DJs, a movie on the patio, or a benefit for an
alternative magazine, and you’ll always find a mixed but congenial
crowd of locals. Usually there’s no cover; for special events you may pay
around $7.
Drinking in the Atmosphere: The Best 
Places to Have a Drink and Mingle
San Francisco offers a special ambience. From coffee shops and dance
clubs to galleries and restaurants, there’s something to appeal to every
persuasion. If atmosphere is what you’re after, check out these favorites.
Joining the singles scene
The Balboa Cafe, 3199 Fillmore St., between Greenwich and Filbert streets
(% 415-921-3944), has withstood the test of time. The bar/restaurant gets
lots of repeat customers — they come here after every divorce. In and
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: San Francisco Nightlife 
266

around the Tenderloin, patrons line up to enter the Red Room, 827 Sutter
St., between Jones and Leavenworth streets, next door to the Commodore
Hotel (% 415-346-7666). Look sharp. Bambuddha Lounge, at the Phoenix
Hotel, 601 Eddy St., at Larkin Street (% 415-885-5088), combines an Asian
sensibility with the desire to have a really good time eating, drinking, and
checking out the people around the pool. It offers innovative cocktail fare,
house music nightly, and well-regarded food. Blondie’s Bar and No Grill,
540 Valencia St., between 16th and 17th streets (% 415-864-2419), is on
the sizzling Valencia Street corridor in the Mission District. The young and
the restless make good use of the free jazz jukebox. The Make-Out Room,
also in the Mission at 3225 22nd St. (% 415-647-2888), attracts a very
attractive young crowd and features alternative bands (cover ranges from
free to about $8).
The Mission has its own version of the Bermuda Triangle, and, if you
have the stamina to investigate, you could begin the evening at Latin
American Club, 3286 22nd St. (% 415-647-2732). This bar has an
unstructured feel — maybe it’s the piñatas hanging from the ceiling —
and you’ll see lots of mid-20s to mid-30s people hanging out and drinking
while they wait for things to get going at one of the nearby music clubs.
Although the Make-Out Room is just across the street, walk down to
Mission St. and see what’s happening at 12 Galaxies, 2565 Mission St.
(% 415-970-9777; www.12galaxies.com), which on some nights is a
little out of this world. Live music draws the local party crowd, and not
infrequently the club is the scene of theme bashes. The night I visited,
the Devil-Ettes were out in full force, horns and all, for their five-year
anniversary go-go blowout. Right next door is Doc’s Clock, 2575 Mission
St. (% 415-824-3627; www.docsclock.com), which is the best bar in the
area — according to Aiden, who checks identification at the door. He
also pointed out that it has the only shuffleboard in the Mission, plus
charming, articulate bartenders. For a more low-key neighborhood hang-
out (with free Wi-Fi), follow your ears to Revolution Cafe, 3248 22nd St.,
at Bartlett Street (% 415-642-0474). Open at 9 a.m. daily for coffee and
croissants, it offers live music on weekends, when a great local crowd
spills out onto the street, giving this little cafe a party vibe. Squeeze
your way to the bar for beer on tap, wine, sandwiches, and snacks.
Still too fancy for you? A most solid dive bar with a huge list of beers,
cheap cocktails, free popcorn, pool table, jukebox, and outdoor patio for
smokers would be Lucky 13, 2140 Market St. (% 415-487-1313), near the
Castro and just off the J-Church and F-Market Muni lines. The clientele is
a mixture of hipsters and couples meeting for a pre-dinner drink, but
given the crowds and the lack of lighting, you may not notice.
Mixing with the sophisticates
A splendid Art Deco supper club, Bix, 56 Gold St., off Montgomery Street
between Pacific and Jackson streets in the Financial District (% 415-433-
6300; www.bixrestaurant.com), will make you want to wear a bias-cut
gown (or a dinner jacket, perhaps) and appear very glamorous. The food
is good, too. The Redwood Room, at the Clift Hotel, 495 Geary St., at
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 267

Jones Street (% 415-929-2372), is not quite the refined place it was in
my mother’s day, but the clientele appears to have dropped in from a
Vanity Fair photo shoot. The Tonga Room at the Fairmont Hotel, 950
Mason St., at California Street (% 415-772-5278), features a happy hour
buffet weekdays from 5 to 7 p.m. For the price of a drink (about $7), you
can enjoy hors d’oeuvres and entertainment — a tropical rainstorm hits
every half-hour. Okay, okay, maybe that isn’t so sophisticated, but at
least the hotel’s posh.
Speakeasys are back, as evidenced by Bourbon and Branch, a bar in the
Tenderloin that requires you to make reservations online and then use a
password (which arrives in an e-mail) for entry. Now, given the number
of places in San Francisco delighted to ply you with liquor, you may be
thinking, “Why go to the trouble?” But part of the fun of drinking here,
besides the superbly concocted drinks, stylish atmosphere, and upmar-
ket clientele, is going to the trouble of drinking here. Anyway, it’s fun.
Contact the bar at www.bourbonandbranch.com for reservations. And
even though you aren’t supposed to know this already, the address is
501 Jones St., between Geary and O’Farrell streets (% 415-346-1735). 
By the by, all those people heading through a door to the back room are
taking a booze mixology class.
Heading to the local for a pint
Chief among our expat watering holes is Edinburgh Castle Pub, 950
Geary St., near Polk Street (% 415-885-4074), which offers a mix of
entertainment, ranging from live music to readings to Quiz Night on
Tuesday. A pool table adds to its stellar reputation. There’s no cover
charge. Convenient to Union Square is the fine Johnny Foley’s, 243
O’Farrell St. (% 415-954-0777). If you’re in the mood for bangers and
mash or fish and chips, this is the place to be. It schedules live enter-
tainment nightly. Missing Guinness? Head to O’Reilly’s, 622 Green St. 
(% 415-989-6222), an Irish pub (no kidding) with two-toned stout and
weekend brunch, as well as an authentic crowd of employed locals.
Bringing the kids along
Biscuits and Blues, 401 Mason St., at Geary Street (% 415-292-2583), is
near the theater district on Union Square in a basement room. The all-
ages venue has inexpensive food ($13–$16 entrees), and the music — by
blues musicians of varied repute — is really good. If you dine here, you
get the best seats in the house. Tickets are $13 to $35. I’d also check out
the free jam sessions Thursday to Sunday from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m.
The Great American Music Hall (see “Catching the big-name acts,” ear-
lier in this chapter), allows children over 6 for some shows; call for an
events calendar to see who’s playing an early show. Because they offer
food service, Yoshi’s and Jazz at Pearl’s can also accommodate minors.
The same is true of Slim’s and Bottom of the Hill. (See “Finding some
cool jazz” and “Catching the big-name acts,” earlier in this chapter.)

Laughing It Up: Comedy Clubs
I probably don’t have to remind you that San Francisco is where Robin
Williams got his start and where Lenny Bruce once shocked the audi-
ence at the Purple Onion by using foul language. Imagine that. Although
the city is no longer the hotbed of chuckles that it was in the ’70s, the
comedy clubs are still packin’ ’em in.
Cobb’s Comedy Club, 915 Columbus Ave. (% 415-928-4320; www.cobbs
comedy.com), features headliners Thursday through Sunday and more
eclectic shows on some Wednesday nights. Check the calendar for
details. No one under 16 admitted; tickets range from $20 to $40, and
there’s a two-drink minimum. The Punchline Comedy Club, 444 Battery
St., between Washington and Clay streets (% 415-397-7573; www.punch
linecomedyclub.com), also books local and nationally known comics
nightly at 9 p.m. with a second set at 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday. These
shows are open only to folks 18 and over; tickets range from $5 to $20,
and there’s a two-drink minimum. The Valencia Street corridor in the
Mission District is one hot property, but before it was the place to be, it
was the longtime ’hood of The Marsh, 1062 Valencia St. (% 800-838-
3006 or 415-826-5750; www.themarsh.org), a complex of theaters
devoted to developing work, performance art, storytellers, musicians,
and comedians, including Marga Gomez. Monday night showcases
works-in-progress, and Wednesday night features the “Rising Series.”
Check the Web site for more events. And because I’m a big believer in
supporting the local talent (and saving a couple of bucks), laugh for less
at San Francisco Comedy College and Clubhouse, 414 Mason St., No.
705 (% 415-921-2051; www.sfcomedycollege.com). You can check out
the comedians of the future on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday night.
Tickets are around $10. It’s BYOB, and no liquor license means no two-
drink minimum.
Defying Categorization: Unique Bars
If you smoke and drink, or drink and don’t mind smoke, Amber, 718 
14th St., around Church and Sanchez streets (% 415-626-7827), is the
bar for you. This is a locals’ hangout with high-quality booze, a comfy
lounge, and excellent lighting. Li-Po Cocktail Lounge, 916 Grant Ave., at
Washington Street (% 415-982-0072), is an authentic, dark, Chinatown
dive, complete with dusty Asian furnishings, a huge rice-paper lantern,
and a shrine to Buddha behind the bar. If you want to drink with profes-
sionals, head to North Beach and grab a barstool at Gino and Carlo’s,
548 Green St., between Columbus and Grant avenues (% 415-421-0896),
which opens early so the regulars can get in a fortifying scotch before
lunch. Spec’s, 12 Saroyan Alley, off Columbus Avenue and Broadway 
(% 415-421-4112), is another North Beach institution — dark and dingy,
but historic.
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 269

Literary types make a pilgrimage to Vesuvio in North Beach, where Jack
Kerouac passed the time. It’s at 255 Columbus Ave. (% 415-362-3370),
next to Kerouac Alley, where the author used to pass out.
Fancy yourself an undiscovered singing sensation? Make your way to the
back room at Martuni’s, 4 Valencia St., at Market Street (% 415-241-0205),
where customers croon and the piano player is kind.
Champagne lovers unite in the Financial District at the Bubble Lounge,
714 Montgomery St. (% 415-434-4204). The bar has over 300 sparkling
wines, plush sofas, and an array of financial-center types reminiscing
over their expense accounts.
If you’re around Polk Street for dinner, stop in afterward at the Bigfoot
Lodge, a retro, log-cabin-like bar with good recorded music, a cool
crowd of singles, and a wooden likeness of Bigfoot, as we imagine him 
to be. Find all this and more at 1750 Polk St., near Washington Street 
(% 415-440-2355). Alternatively, Hemlock Tavern, 1131 Polk St. at Post
Street (% 415-923-0923; www.hemlocktavern.com), brings in two indie
bands most nights to play in one of the smallest enclosed public spaces
I’ve seen. It has another room for drinking, a pool table, and a patio for
smoking. Over in Hayes Valley, you can snack on corn dogs and other
foodlike products, drink, and discover what’s happening in the indie
music scene at Rickshaw Stop, 155 Fell St. at Van Ness Avenue (% 415-
861-2011; www.rickshawstop.com). Events are scheduled Wednesday
through Saturday nights, and tickets are $5 to $15 at the door.
For beer, wine, and entertainment in an atmospheric red haze, Amnesia,
853 Valencia St., between 19th and 20th streets (% 415-970-0012; www.
amnesiathebar.com) is an excellent pick. You can find a calendar of
events on the Web site, but my suggestion is to just show up and be sur-
prised. The neighborhood has enough places for dinner that you can
easily plan a night worth telling your pals back home about.
Stepping Out: The Gay and Lesbian Scene
In this section, I give you a short list of the many clubs and bars that
cater to the gay and lesbian community. Find specific listings in the
weekly entertainment guides, SF Weekly and Bay Guardian, and look for
the free Bay Area Reporter in bookstores, cafes, and bars around town.
Another well-regarded free guide is the Gay Pocketguide, which you can
find wherever the Reporter is available.
The Cafe, 2367 Market St., near Castro Street (% 415-861-3846), is cur-
rently the place for both sexes to go dancing. It’s also the place to stand
in line on weekend nights. Farther into the Castro is The Men’s Room,
3988 18th St., at Noe St. (% 415-861-1310). It’s a neighborhood bar but
welcoming to all, according to my source, Paul, who bartends at Twin
Peaks Tavern, 401 Castro St., at Market Street (% 415-864-9470), an
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: San Francisco Nightlife 
270

unpretentious, comfy landmark with a pleasant clientele that spans the
ages. Outside of the Castro, Paul also recommends Truck, 1900 Folsom
St. (% 415-252-0306; www.trucksf.com), popular for sweet bartenders,
a mellow crowd of regulars, and decent bar food. Endup is another gay
icon, a hangout as well as a dance club. South of Market at 401 Sixth St.
(% 415-646-0999), it’s a San Francisco institution like the cable cars or
Coit Tower. Cover is $20.
To be entertained or be entertaining, try Martuni’s piano bar (see the
preceding section), which is certainly gay-friendly, but you should also
make your way to The Mint Karaoke Lounge, 1942 Market St. in the
Castro (% 415-626-4726). On the weekends, the hard core come in to
warm up at 4 p.m., but the show goes on seven nights a week, and it’s
terrifically fun. Some of the singers may cause you to drink too much to
stop the pain, but others will have you raising your eyebrows in pleased
amazement. Your fellow imbibers will likely be quite friendly, so I can
almost guarantee that you’ll have a good time. Stop off at the ATM
before you arrive, because the bar accepts cash only.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
W
hipping up these top-ten lists was a challenge! I’m just
glad I didn’t have to come up with my ten favorite
restaurants (too challenging) or my ten favorite parking
places (the ﬁrst ten available spots, wherever they are).
Instead, in this part I offer you my humble opinions on the
greatest views, the best pastimes in foul weather, useful/play-
ful gifts that won’t damage your credit rating, and the best
ways to look less like a tourist — not that I have anything
against tourists, mind you.

Chapter 17
The Top Ten San Francisco
Views
In This Chapter
 Finding the best panoramas
 Golfing, dining, and drinking cocktails, with a view
 Checking out the view from Berkeley
P
eople like views. That much is clear from the wrangling for a table
with a view in restaurants, and from the extra tariff imposed on a
room with a view, not to mention a home with a view. San Francisco is
one major view, owing to all those hills. I admit to a permanent senti-
mental attachment to the views of San Francisco. Following are some of
my favorites.
From Twin Peaks
The mother of all views — if the weather cooperates — is from Twin
Peaks, which sits in the center of San Francisco in a residential neigh-
borhood at the top of Market Street. The sightline encompasses the
entrance to the bay and reaches all the way ’round to Candlestick Point.
If you’re driving, head southwest on Market Street, which becomes
Portola Drive past 17th Street. The first light past Corbett Street is a
right turn only; this is Twin Peaks Boulevard, the road that takes you up
the hill.
The 37-Corbett bus, which you can catch on Market and Church streets,
takes passengers near, but not all the way to, Twin Peaks. And the rest of
the trip is quite a hike uphill. If you’d prefer something less strenuous
and want to see one of San Francisco’s beautiful “hidden” staircases,
here’s a tip: Exit the bus at Corbett and Clayton streets, and look for an
old concrete wall on the west side of Clayton marked by a street sign
that says “Pemberton.” This leads to the Pemberton Stairs. You won’t
get to the top of Twin Peaks by climbing them, but you’ll enjoy bay
views in quiet, green surroundings.

From Bernal Heights Park
Look southeast from downtown and you’ll spot a prominent hill with a
few trees decorating the top. That’s Bernal Heights Park, the favored
dog-walking and fireworks-viewing area for the Bernal Heights neighbor-
hood. The weather in this part of town is far superior to the weather
around Twin Peaks, which can get really foggy, much to the dismay of
the camera-toting folk on the tour buses. I consider the views here
equally wonderful, partly because Bernal Hill is closer to downtown and
the bay. The 67-Folsom bus drives to the end of Folsom at Esmeralda.
Exit and walk up the hill on any of a number of paths.
From Lincoln Park
Lincoln Park is one of the prettiest golf courses in creation, situated
around the Palace of the Legion of Honor and above the entrance to San
Francisco Bay at Land’s End. Standing in front of the museum, you can
see in the distance a snippet of downtown framed within the green
branches of fir trees. From here, walk west down the street. You’ll be
stunned by a postcard-perfect view of the Golden Gate Bridge from a
unique perspective — facing north as if you’re entering the bay. Take a
seat on one of the benches along the street so you can survey the vista
in comfort. The 18–46th Avenue bus stops in the museum parking lot.
From the Beach Chalet Restaurant
The waves along Ocean Beach, at the end of Golden Gate Park on the
Great Highway, are at times soothing and at times violent enough to dis-
courage beachcombing. In either case, you’ll be as comfy as a babe in a
crib if you get a table upstairs in the Beach Chalet restaurant (% 415-
386-8439) overlooking the Pacific (ideally, as the sun sets). Willis Polk
designed the building, and murals painted in the 1930s by the same
artist who created the frescoes at Coit Tower adorn the first-floor visitor
center. The restaurant is particularly popular for its menu of house-
brewed beers, and it serves throughout the day and evening, starting at
breakfast. If you don’t want to wait for a table in the dining room (the
food is so-so), you can take a seat in the bar (a much better idea) and
turn toward the view, dramatic in any season. The Park Chalet part of
the building looks onto, well, the park, of course. The 5-Fulton bus,
which you can pick up on Market and Powell streets, takes you to Ocean
Beach, a block or so from the Beach Chalet.
Above Dolores Park
From any Muni Metro station (the Powell Street Station being the closest
to Union Square), take the J-Church toward Daly City. Exit on 18th and
Church streets, above Dolores Park. The city and bay views over this
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
276

stretch of green on a clear day have been responsible for more than one
decision to relocate to the Bay Area. After soaking in the scenery and
taking a stroll through the park, walk two blocks north on Dolores Street
until you reach Mission Dolores at 16th and Dolores streets, the oldest
building in San Francisco. Top this off with an ice cream from Bi-Rite
Creamery, 3692 18th St. (across from the park), possibly the most deli-
cious cone in town, and certainly the most creative.
From the Top of the Mark
If you feel like having a cocktail as you drink in a view, head to the Top 
of the Mark in the InterContinental Mark Hopkins hotel, 1 Nob Hill, at
California and Mason streets (% 415-392-3434). Sometimes it’s so busy
you have to wait in line at the elevator, but the city views from the tables
are mesmerizing.
From the Cheesecake Factory
Union Square is a compact urban hub, immensely appealing, especially
when it’s crowded and bustling. Above the madding crowd, Macy’s (see
Chapter 12) has a branch of the Cheesecake Factory (% 415-397-3333)
on the eighth floor. Management shrewdly included a heated patio for
diners who favor a city view in all its skyscrapered glory. The restaurant
is open Monday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Friday and
Saturday until midnight, and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
From Fisherman’s Wharf
If you’ve skipped straight to this section, you won’t know that I, like all
upstanding San Franciscans, generally avoid Fisherman’s Wharf (see
Chapter 11) the way I avoid the Oakland A’s. However, I recently discov-
ered a way to escape the folks crowding the sidewalks, yet still take
advantage of the views and freshly cracked crab.
The crab stands are plopped in front of their namesake restaurants
along one block off Jefferson Street. Just to the left of Fisherman’s Grotto
#9 are glass doors marked PASSAGEWAY TO THE BOATS, the boats being what
remains of the fishing fleet. Take your cracked crab, your beer, and
plenty of napkins, and push through. You’ll be on a pier that leads to the
tiny Fisherman’s and Seaman’s Memorial Chapel on your right, with
views of the bay and Telegraph Hill in front and to your left. The pier is
parallel to Jefferson Street but may be gloriously close to empty even on
a weekend. You can eat your crab in peace sitting on the dock of the bay,
watching . . . well, you know. Close by, sea lions jump, swim, and beg in
the waters below.
Chapter 17: The Top Ten San Francisco Views 277

From Fort Point
The remains of Fort Point, an 1861 brick artillery fortress, occupy the
land at the edge of the bay nearest the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember
the first time I visited this area, because heavy fog obscured everything
around me except the uppermost portion of the bridge. It was a dra-
matic vision. On a clear day, you’ll be treated to the bridge, of course,
but also to bright views of the downtown skyline and Alcatraz. The 29-
Sunset bus stops as close as the parking lot next to the bridge visitor
center, a downhill walk to a particularly pretty viewpoint in the midst of
eucalyptus trees. If you’re up for a hike, follow the joggers past the
Marina Green and through the Presidio (see Chapter 11).
From UC Berkeley Botanical Gardens
Drive to the UC Berkeley Botanical Gardens, high in the hills behind the
campus. Find the rose garden. Beyond the plants, you can see the bay
and San Francisco, small and glowing in the distance. See Chapter 14 for
other ideas on what to do in Berkeley after you finish admiring the view.

Ten Things to Do If It’s
Raining (Or Just Too Foggy)
In This Chapter
 Making the most of a soggy day
 Pampering yourself at the hot springs or spa
 Finding entertaining indoor activities
S
an Francisco isn’t Seattle or London by any means, but our gray
days can get in the way of enjoying the city. Actually, a foggy morn-
ing is what bothers people most — fog is always cold and damp and
dark. But you don’t have time to grouse about the weather. You have
things to do, places to see, people to meet . . . oh, you don’t like getting
wet? Okay. Here are a few rainy/foggy-day options.
Taking Afternoon Tea
Afternoon tea at one of the many hotels that offers it is probably the
only civilized way to keep dry. Try the cozy King George Hotel, 334
Mason St. (% 415-283-4TEA; weekends only); the Fairmont Hotel’s
Laurel Court, California and Mason streets (% 415-772-5260); the
Palace Hotel, Market and New Montgomery streets (% 415-546-5089;
Sat only); or the Ritz-Carlton, 600 Stockton St. (% 415-773-6198).
Neiman Marcus also has a lovely, traditional tea service in the Rotunda
restaurant, 150 Stockton St. (% 415-362-4777), from 2:30 to 5 p.m. daily.
Checking Out Japantown
Head to Japantown and take cover inside the Kinokuniya Building at
1581 Webster St., between Post Street and Geary Boulevard. Although
the exteriors of this and the other buildings in the area aren’t much to
look at, inside you can get a delicious bowl of noodles at Mifune (see
Chapter 10), the most authentic noodle house in town. Then entertain
yourself in any of a number of stores, such as Mashiko Folkcraft (open:
Wed–Mon 11 a.m.–6 p.m.) and the Kinokuniya Bookstore (open: daily

10:30 a.m.–7 p.m.). If the sky still hasn’t cleared, take in a movie at the
Sundance Kabuki Cinemas, next door. Robert Redford’s organization
has tarted up this multiplex and tacks on an “amenities” fee to the ticket
prices, but the theaters are comfortable. Another perfect way to spend a
half-hour or more is getting a chair massage at Sain Saine, 22 Peace
Plaza (% 415-292-3542), steps away from the entrance to the Hotel
Kabuki (see Chapter 9). In the interest of research, I had two, and my
shoulders have never felt so fine. Plus the price is right, at $1 a minute.
An underground parking lot is off Webster Street. Muni buses 2-Clement,
3-Jackson, 4-Sutter, 22-Fillmore, and 38-Geary all drop you in Japantown.
Luxuriating at Kabuki Springs
Staying indoors can turn into a modest luxury at Kabuki Springs & Spa,
1750 Geary Blvd., at Webster Street (% 415-922-6000; www.kabuki
springs.com), a most respectable communal bathhouse. You can soak
your feet, have a massage, and take a steam bath. Women may use the
communal bath facilities on Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday; Tuesday is
coed; and men get the rest of the week. Shy people may not feel comfort-
able at first walking around the premises au naturel, but no one will
bother you. Massages, facials, acupuncture, and other treatments are by
appointment. To get here, take the 38-Geary bus. Open daily from 10 a.m.
to 10 p.m.
Rock Climbing (Or Working Out) at the
Touchstone Mission Cliffs Gym
Rather than let the kids climb the walls in your hotel room, take every-
one rock climbing (indoors, of course) in the Mission District at
Touchstone Mission Cliffs Climbing and Fitness, 2295 Harrison St., at
19th Street (% 415-550-0515), and open every day. This world-class
facility caters to beginners and experts of all ages and even folks who
never dreamed of making like flies. Belay (rope handling) classes run
regularly, so you can act as assistant to your compadres and vice versa.
You don’t even need any special equipment — you can rent whatever is
necessary (including shoes) — and there goes your final excuse. Also
on-site is a gym with locker rooms and a sauna, relief for those who
prefer to keep their feet on the floor.
Watching the Weather from the Cliff House
Admire the storm from the confines of the Cliff House, 1090 Point Lobos
Ave., on the Great Highway (% 415-386-3330), open every day. This his-
toric property has two restaurants, a bar, and viewing decks. The food,
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
280

while rather expensive, is quite good, but what you are really shelling
out for is the impressive view of Seal Rocks and the Pacific Ocean,
doubly dramatic if waves are crashing about. The closest museum is the
Palace of the Legion of Honor (see Chapter 11), another wonderful
place to wait out the weather (it has a good cafe). The 18–46th Avenue
bus serves both locations.
Finding Activities for Everyone at the 
Metreon and Yerba Buena Gardens
The Metreon and Yerba Buena Gardens (see Chapter 11) make up a
one-stop rainy-day haven, particularly if you’re traveling with your
family. Depending on everyone’s ages, you don’t have to stick together
for the entire day. Teens can flex their independence at Zeum or in the
Tilt arcade. The elders, if they aren’t needed, can shop, play pool at
Jillian’s (the large restaurant on the first floor), or even dash across the
street to the Museum of Modern Art. Bowling and ice-skating work for
everyone, and when it’s time to regroup, you can see what’s playing at
the movies.
Defying the Weather at the California
Academy of Sciences
The California Academy of Sciences (see Chapter 11) has returned to
Golden Gate Park, and the new building is spectacular. You don’t need
kids along to enjoy the exhibits (although there’s no kid-friendlier place
in town), and with the planetarium shows, three-story rain forest, cafe,
and gift shop, you may pray for drizzle. Time permitting, you can later
run across the music concourse to the de Young Museum and get all
your culture tourism finished in one day.
Moving to the Beat Museum
Borrow an umbrella from your hotel, head to Caffe Roma in North Beach
for a sustaining espresso, then walk over to the Beat Museum, 540
Broadway (% 415-399-9626; www.kerouac.com), to either jog your rec-
ollections of the ’60s or educate yourself on an era that changed San
Francisco. For a modest $5 admission fee, you can sit in the eight-chair
screening room and watch a documentary about the Beats; see Jack
Kerouac’s typewriter, manuscripts, letters, and photos; and perhaps get
in on an event, such as a poetry reading. Tie-dyed goods and excellent 
T-shirts fill the gift shop. Open daily from 10 a.m.–10 p.m., this is cer-
tainly an only-in–San Francisco way to spend an hour or two while you
wait for the rain to clear.
Chapter 18: Ten Things to Do If It’s Raining (Or Just Too Foggy) 281

Babying Yourself at Nordstrom
See if you can get an appointment for a manicure, a pedicure, and/or a
facial at Nordstrom in the San Francisco Centre shopping mall at Fifth
and Market streets (% 415-977-5102). If you have a retinue to deal with,
send them to the fourth-floor grill for lunch or a snack. You can find lots
of shopping opportunities here as well, although most of the stores are
your typical mall flavors. There’s also a spa at the Bloomingdale’s
Westfield Centre next to Nordies, along with many more shops and
restaurants.
Doing Business on a Rainy Day
A great thing to do is sit around your hotel lobby or, better yet, the glam-
orous lobby at the Palace Hotel, 2 New Montgomery St., and complain
about the weather. Grab a copy of the Chronicle and maybe the Wall
Street Journal for good measure. Whisper into a cellphone while gripping
a cup of coffee in your free hand. Then hail a cab and dash to the nearest
Internet cafe to check your e-mail: Golden Gate Perk, 401 Bush St. at
Kearney Street (% 415-362-3929), has computers if you didn’t bring
your laptop, and Café de la Presse, 352 Grant Ave. (% 415-398-2680),
has free Wi-Fi. The terminals at the Apple Stores on Stockton Street and
Chestnut Street get busy, but using them is free. Anyway, if you think the
rain is bad, be thankful you haven’t been inundated with foggy mornings
for 40 days straight. Now you know why anyone who can afford a
summer house in Napa puts up with the traffic on Friday afternoon.

Chapter 19
Ten Ways to Avoid Looking
Like a Tourist
In This Chapter
 Eating, shopping, and dressing like the locals
 Avoiding tourist traps
I
don’t understand why some people consider being a tourist so
beneath them. Even my own dear husband scoffs at tourists — or
people he presumes are tourists — and when we travel, he does his well-
meaning best to look like a local. This generally leads to amusing misun-
derstandings with actual citizens, who ask him something in a language
he doesn’t understand, or presume he knows where he’s going when he
hasn’t a clue. So, why live a lie, I say. If you’re visiting for pleasure and
have a keen interest in looking around, you’re a tourist. Be proud. Wear
that camera around your neck (but maybe leave the bum bag at home).
Rattle a map in frustration. Ask a stranger for directions.
Otherwise, memorize the following tips.
Dress for the Weather
This is not The O.C. — you cannot tan here. In summer, San Francisco is
foggy and cold in the morning and turns sunny in the afternoon, with
temperatures in the upper 60s or low 70s. I know this because the mete-
orologists repeat the same forecast every morning in July and August.
Dress in long pants, not shorts. Wear a sweater over your T-shirt and a
jacket over both. You can always tie extraneous clothing around your
waist when you enter one of our famous microclimates. In San Francisco,
the temperature changes from neighborhood to neighborhood, so if
you’re shivering in Golden Gate Park, head to the Mission to warm up.
September and October are the warmest months. If you look good in
shorts, wear them then.

Don’t Trust Your Map
Those darn hills have a way of interrupting the streets in ways that may
not be apparent to the untrained eye. It may look like a straight shot
from one part of town to the other, but consider the up-and-down of the
steep hills. Telegraph Hill is the worst offender. If you can’t go through,
you’ll have to go around. If you plan to walk to a particular destination,
ask first at the hotel or call ahead to see if it’s more advisable to take
public transit or a cab.
Don’t Gawk at Tall Buildings
An article in the San Francisco Chronicle noted that San Franciscans do
not gawk at tall buildings, although I don’t know if that includes sky-
scrapers in other towns. The author also noted that San Franciscans 
are breaking their own rule and gawking like mad at the downtown 
ballpark. So, if you don’t want to look like a tourist, don’t stare at the
Transamerica Pyramid — a quick glance should do — but feel free to
drool while admiring AT&T Park. You’ll then resemble a local who didn’t
buy season tickets.
Don’t Eat or Shop Like a Tourist
Be picky about where you spend your time and money. Places most resi-
dents wouldn’t be caught dead include the Hard Rock Cafe, any restau-
rant on Fisherman’s Wharf, Ripley’s Believe It or Not!, and the Golden
Gate Bridge on a Friday afternoon.
Wait ’til You Get Back to the Airport to Buy
That Delicious San Francisco Sourdough
Don’t walk around with loaves of bread wrapped in plastic for the trip
home. Around here we buy our baguettes for same-day consumption.
Anyway, you can buy that particular brand of bread at the airport, where
no one will see you.
Cross the Bridge before or after — but 
Not during — Rush Hour
Don’t cross the Bay Bridge between 3 and 7 p.m. unless you want to be
mistaken for a suburban commuter. Anyway, no one, not even a bona
fide commuter, actually crosses the Bay Bridge at this time; rather,
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
284

everyone sits, fumes, and occasionally inches forward. This is important
to remember if you have friends in the East Bay who invite you to come
over for dinner.
Don’t Stare at the Locals
Don’t point/gasp/shriek at the man/woman/other with the attention-
getting tattoo/leather chaps/chartreuse wig, no matter how unusual
he/she/it appears. That would be unseemly.
Don’t Shout at People You Suspect 
Don’t Speak English
Don’t raise your voice or speak extra slowly to your waiter if you sus-
pect he doesn’t speak English. In fact, he does speak English. He’s
merely trying to turn your table as quickly as possible.
Do the Farmers Market Thing
Hang around the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market on a Saturday morning.
Have breakfast, circle the stalls, eat all the samples, buy something non-
perishable to take home. If you really want to blend in with the natives,
head to the Alemany Farmers Market (off 280 South at Alemany) on a
Saturday morning instead. You’ll need to take a cab.
Remove Any Incriminating Evidence
Remember the plastic nametag you attached to your lapel upon entering
the Moscone Convention Center? It’s okay to remove it now.

Chapter 20
The Top Ten Gifts for
Cheapskates
In This Chapter
 Bridging the gap with Golden Gate souvenirs
 Sweetening the return with fortune-cookie souvenirs
 Spreading the fruits of love with gifts of jam
I
don’t know about you, but buying gifts for the folks back at the ranch
who know I’ve been on vacation is sometimes more a chore than a
pleasure. Besides the fact that no one in the Western world really needs
another T-shirt, those souvenirs add up (and subtract from my shoe
allowance). Understanding, however, that some people expect a little
something, here is my list of portable, fun, San Francisco–related gifts —
and they’re (almost) all under $10.
Playing Bridge
Not to be outdone by the museum gift shops, our own Golden Gate
Bridge hawks a variety of items sure to remind your nearest and dearest
of one of the wonders of the modern world. I particularly like the $6
Golden Gate Bridge playing cards, printed with trivia about the con-
struction and history of the landmark. A close second is the $7 Golden
Gate Bridge kitchen towel, the gift of choice from thrifty shoppers like
my cousin Irene. If you run out of time and can’t get to the gift shop, you
can purchase these things online at http://store.goldengate.org.
Riding High
Everyone loves refrigerator magnets, right? So take an F-Market street-
car to the Embarcadero, locate the streetcar museum (see Chapter 11)
and take home a $4.99 die-cut historic magnet that possibly resembles
the very car you rode in on Market St. Or take home all six models and
thrill the relatives.

Smelling Salts
The Ferry Building Marketplace is full of places to find great gifts, espe-
cially on Saturday, when the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market is running at
full tilt. Behind the building, look for the Eatwell Farms booth and check
out the $8 jars of lavender salt or rosemary salt. They smell divine and
add extra oomph to salads and roasts. Your friends who cook will be
most impressed.
Bringing Good Fortune
The biggest producer of fortune cookies in town is Mee Mee Bakery,
1328 Stockton St., between Broadway and Vallejo streets in Chinatown
(% 415-362-3253; www.meemeebakery.com). Hand over $10.25 and you
can delight someone with a giant fortune cookie. Okay, at roughly 5
inches in diameter, maybe it’s not an actual giant, but it’s still fairly large.
Mee Mee also sells bags of chocolate- and strawberry-flavored fortune
cookies for $6.75 per pound, and almond cookies for $4.75 per pound. If
you want to splurge on something more creative, for about $25 per 100
cookies, the bakery will put your own custom fortunes inside the crispy
little devils.
Lighting the Way
Intellectuals and all your friends who belong to book clubs will be
thrilled to receive anything from City Lights, San Francisco’s iconic
bookstore. For those keeping to a budget, check out the very cool $8
black-and-white posters featuring the North Beach storefront, or Jack
Kerouac and Neal Cassady looking rather James Deanish.
Writing Clearly
You can’t have too many postcards, but picking them out can be stress-
ful. After all, postcards are like greeting cards — they say something
about the person who spent 20 minutes deciding between the one with
the cat and the one depicting Einstein. Save time and give your friends a
book of 30 San Francisco postcards featuring the photographs of Michal
Venera. At $9.95, this is a deal. Find San Francisco 30 postcards at the
Chronicle Books Metreon Store, 101 4th St. (% 415-369-6271).
Spilling the Beans
You may not believe this, but B.S. (before Starbucks), people in the Bay
Area were drinking strong, delicious coffee! And many continue to do so.
They purchase it at any of a number of Peet’s Coffee & Tea stores,
Chapter 20: The Top Ten Gifts for Cheapskates 287

including the ones in the Ferry Building (see Chapter 10), in the Russ
Building at 217 Montgomery St., and at 2156 Chestnut St. in the Marina.
A gift your coffee-loving pals will truly appreciate is a pound of Peet’s
French Roast, my husband’s favorite — the stuff is so strong it can
bench-press the competition. At $11.95 per pound, it crosses the cheap-
skate limit, but not by much. Besides, it’s worth it.
Ringing Your Bell
Useless ornaments . . . ah, where would commerce be without snow
globes, pewter models, and plastic barista figurines? Well, San Francisco
can supply its fair share, and at the top of my list is a spiffy tin cable car.
A mere $8.75, this little beauty actually moves using friction, and ting-a-
lings like the real thing while skittering over the linoleum. These are
among the many fine doodads available online and at the Cable Car
Museum gift shop, 1201 Mason St. (% 415-474-1887; www.cablecar
museum.org). Admission to the museum is free. It’s open every day from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Nibbling Bliss
San Francisco has long attracted chocolate makers to its shores, not for
any reason I know of. Ghirardelli started things off, followed by Joseph
Schmidt (of the beautiful truffles), and most recently by a former doctor
and a former winemaker who together produce some serious dark
chocolate under the Scharffen Berger label. Free one-hour tours of the
handsome brick factory, at 914 Heinz Ave., Berkeley (% 510-981-4050;
www.scharffenberger.com), are offered by appointment daily from
10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. for people 10 and older. Scharffen Berger sells two
gifts that I, for one, would be genuinely pleased to receive: the $10.50
folio box filled with a dozen squares of chocolate in four different fla-
vors, and the $7 rectangular acrylic package of a dozen 5-gram
squares (the 70 percent cacao bittersweet, if you’re wondering).
Spreading the Love
Twelve bucks for a small jar of jam? Berkeley’s June Taylor does not
make ordinary preserves from ordinary fruit, and her divine products
created from organic fruit in small batches do not sell for chicken feed.
And that’s why an 8-ounce jar of her white nectarine conserve or tan-
gerine marmalade (among many flavors that will cause your bread to
sit up and take notice) is such a thoughtful and extravagant offering. Buy
June Taylor’s jams at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market on Saturday or at
Boulette’s Larder in the Ferry Building.

hotel can also contact on-call doctors.
Before receiving any treatment, check with
your health insurance company to find out
how to handle emergency treatment when
you’re out of your provider area.
Earthquakes
California will always have earthquakes,
most of which you’ll never notice.

However, in case of a significant shaker,
you should know a few precautionary
measures. When you’re inside a building,
seek cover; do not run outside. Stand
under a doorway or against a wall and stay
away from windows. If you exit a building
after a substantial quake, use stairwells,
not elevators. If you’re in a car, pull over to
the side of the road and stop — but not until
you’re away from bridges, overpasses, tele-
phone poles, and power lines. Stay in your
car. If you’re out walking, stay outside and
away from trees, power lines, and the sides
of buildings. If you’re in an area with tall
buildings, find a doorway in which to stand.
Emergencies
Dial % 911 from any phone for police, an
ambulance, and the fire department.
Hospitals
San Francisco General Hospital, 1001
Potrero Ave. (% 415-206-8111), accepts

% 415-206-5166.
Hot Lines
In case of emergency, here are a few num-
bers to have at hand: Poison Control
Center, % 800-876-4766; Rape Crisis
Center, % 415-861-2024; Family Service
Agency, % 415-474-7310.
Information
The San Francisco Convention and Visitors
Bureau is in the lower level of Hallidie
Plaza, 900 Market St., at Powell Street 
(% 415-391-2000).
Internet Access and Cafes
You can check your e-mail at Golden 
Gate Perk, 401 Bush St. (% 415-362-3929),
or Quetzal Internet Café, 1234 Polk St. 
(% 415-673-4181).
Liquor Laws
You can’t drink or purchase alcohol legally
if you’re under 21. All clubs, bars, super-
markets, and liquor stores require ID from
anyone who looks younger than 30 (try not
to be offended if you don’t get carded).
Bars don’t serve liquor from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Maps
The visitors bureau (see “Information” ear-
lier in this section) has maps of the city.
AAA members can stop by the office (see
“AAA” earlier in this section).
Newspapers/Magazines
The major papers are the morning San
Francisco Chronicle and the afternoon 
San Francisco Examiner. They are avail-
able at sidewalk kiosks and boxes. The
free weekly San Francisco Bay Guardian
includes excellent events listings. Find it in
cafes and in sidewalk boxes around the
city. San Francisco magazine is the
monthly city magazine. You can find it at
newsstands everywhere.
Pharmacies
Walgreens has taken over the city, and you
should be able to find one almost any-
where. Call % 800-WALGREEN for the
address and phone number of the nearest
store. Around Union Square, Walgreens is
at 135 Powell St. (% 415-391-4433), open
Monday through Saturday from 7 a.m. to
midnight and Sunday from 8 a.m. to mid-
night, but the pharmacy keeps shorter
hours. A branch on Divisadero Street at
Lombard Street has a 24-hour pharmacy.
Police
Call % 911 from any phone. No coins are
needed. The non-emergency number is 
% 415-553-0123.
Post Office
Dozens of post offices are located all
around the city. The closest to Union
San Francisco For Dummies, 5th Edition 
290

Square is in Macy’s department store, 
170 O’Farrell St. (% 800-275-8777).
Radio Stations
Find KQED, our National Public Radio affili-
ate, at 88.5 FM. KCBS 740 AM broadcasts
news and sports.
Restrooms
Dark-green public bathrooms are on the
waterfront at PIER 39, on Market Street
near the cable-car turnaround on Powell
Street, and by the Civic Center. The rest-
rooms cost 25¢ and are clean and safe.
Also try hotels, department stores, muse-
ums, coffeehouses, and service stations.
Restaurants usually let only patrons use
their bathrooms.
Safety
Walking around alone late at night is never
a good idea. San Francisco is relatively
safe, but it still has its share of muggings
and more heinous crimes. Areas to be par-
ticularly careful in include the Tenderloin;
the lower Haight; the Mission District any-
where between 16th and 24th streets east
of Mission Street; lower Fillmore Street;
and South of Market, particularly Sixth and
Seventh streets. Keep your wallet in an
inside coat pocket, and don’t carry around
wads of cash. Try to avoid using ATMs at
night.
Smoking
Smoking is illegal in bars, restaurants, and
public buildings, which is why you see so
many well-dressed people loitering on the
sidewalk during their coffee breaks.
Taxes
A sales tax of 8.5 percent is added to all
purchases except snack food. The hotel
and parking garage tax is 14 percent.
Taxis
Outside of Union Square, expect to have
trouble hailing a cab on the street; you’ll
have to call for one instead. Try Yellow Cab
(% 415-626-2345), Veteran’s Cab (% 415-
648-1313), Desoto Cab (% 415-970-1300),
or Luxor Cabs (% 415-282-4141).
Time Zone
California is on Pacific Time, three hours
behind New York.
Transit Information
Calling % 415-817-1717 connects you to
all transit organizations.
Weather Updates
While in town, turn to one of the news 
stations on the radio (try KCBS 740 AM).
Otherwise, www.sanfrancisco.city
search.com lists comprehensive
