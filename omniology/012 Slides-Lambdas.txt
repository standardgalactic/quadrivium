Lambdas Expressions
●
Lambda expressions are another way to create functions;
●
They are called anonymous functions because that don’t have a name like a normal function has;
●
Lambdas are a single line of logical code;
●
Lambda expressions can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to another function;
Syntax:  
 
lambda [parameter list]: expression
 
 
 
>>> type(lambda x: x**2)
<class 'function'>
 
 
●
The "body" of a lambda is limited to a single expression. We cannot do assignments inside 
lambdas expressions;
lambda x: x = 7
SyntaxError: can't assign to lambda
 
 
●
All rules we’ve seen at function’s arguments are applicable to lambdas too.
