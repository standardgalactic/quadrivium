=======================================================================
8.1	
Definitions, Statements and Formulas used:
8.1.1	
‘Availability’ or ‘Available energy’ or ‘Exergy’ [1,5,7]:
Consider a high temp source at temp TH and the environment (sink) at T0. Then, a reversible heat engine 
between the source and the sink will deliver max. work output. However, we also know from II Law 
that all the heat available can not be converted to work, and some amount of heat is necessarily to be 
rejected to the sink. So, the amount of heat rejected is the ‘unavailable part’ of the energy and the Wmax 
obtained is the ‘available part’ of the energy.
Thus, by definition: ‘A system delivers the max. possible work as it undergoes a reversible process from 
the specified initial state to the state if its environment, that is, the ‘dead state’. This is the ‘useful work 
potential’ of the system at the specified state and is called ‘Exergy’.
Exergy of heat: If heat Q is supplied at a source temp of TH and the environment is at T0, the exergy or 
the max. work output is:

Availability or ‘Exergy’ and Irreversibility
Also, the unavailable energy (or ‘anergy’) = T0 .Δs
Exergy of Work: Exergy of work is work itself, since there is no Thermodynamic restriction on 
its availability.
Exergy of Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy: Again, the exergies of K.E. and P.E. are the respective 
energies themselves.
8.1.2	
Decrease in Available energy when heat is transferred through a finite temp. difference:
Whenever heat is transferred through a finite temp difference, there is a decrease in the availability of 
the energy so transferred.
Consider an amount of heat, Q1, supplied at temp T1, the surrounding being at T0. Then the availability 
of this heat Q1 supplied at T1 is: A = Wmax = (T1 – T0). Δs1
Now, if the same amount of heat is supplied from the source at T1 to the engine through a finite temp 
difference, absorbing heat at a lower temp T2, availability of heat as received by the engine at T2 is 
calculated as follows:
We have heat supplied: Q1 = T1 .Δs1 = Q2 = T2.Δs2 
Since T2 < T1, we have: Δs1 < Δs2

Availability or ‘Exergy’ and Irreversibility
And the heat rejected in the second case: Qrej_2 = T0 . Δs2 which is more than the heat rejected in the 
first case, i.e. Qrej_1 = T0 . Δs1 
Therefore, available energy lost = W1 – W2 = T0 . (Δs2 – Δs1) …. Eqn. (8.3)
Note that greater the temp difference (T1 – T2), greater is the heat rejection Qrej_2 and greater is the 
un-available part of the energy.
If heat is supplied at varying temperatures, i.e. at constant pressure:
Then, Available energy is easily calculated as follows:

8.1.3	
Availability (or Exergy) in non-flow systems [5]:
Remember that max. useful work or max. available work is the theoretical max. work of the reversible 
engine minus the work done on the atmosphere by the expanding boundary.
Let the closed system considered be the fluid behind a piston inside a cylinder, at conditions: p1, T1.
Now, let the state change from State 1 to the ambient or ‘dead state’ (denoted by p0, T0). 
Then, we have:
Max. work available = (u1 – u0) – T0 . (s1 – s0) – p0.(v0 – v1) … eqn.(8.4), 
where u = int. energy, s = entropy. And p0.(v0 – v1) is the work done on atmosphere.
(Note: when the fluid undergoes a complete cycle, the work done on the atmosphere is zero).
We write eqn. (8.4) as:
Wmax = a1 – a0 … eqn. (8.5) 
where, a = u + p0.v – T0.s (per unit mass) …. Eqn.(8.6)
is called the non-flow availability function.
Note that ‘a’ is a composite property of the system and its environment.
8.1.4	
Availability (or Exergy) in steady flow systems [5]:
Let the initial conditions of the flow system be p1, T1, Z1. Let this state be reduced to atmospheric or 
‘dead state’ denoted by p0, T0, Z0 (= 0), through an ideal process. Then,
In many systems, changes in K.E and P.E. can be considered as negligible. Then,
where the property, b = h – T0.s (per unit mass) is called the steady flow availability function.
Note that ‘b’ is a composite property of the system and its environment, and is known as Keenan function.

Helmholtz and Gibbs Functions [5]:
Work in a non-flow reversible system is given by:
The term (u – T.s) is known as Helmholtz function.
If the work against atmosphere is p0.(v0 – v1), then:
Max. available work = 
where 
g = (h – T.s) is known as ‘Gibbs function’ or ‘free energy function’.
Now, max. available work when State changes from 1 to 2, is given by:
Similarly, for steady flow system:
Note that Gibbs function, g = (h – T.s) is a property of the system whereas availability function ,i.e. 
a = ( u + p0 . v – T0.s) is a composite property of the system and surroundings.

Effectiveness [5]:
‘Efectiveness’ is defined as the ratio of actual useful work to the max. useful work.
Useful output of a system is given by increase of availability of the surroundings.

Enthalpy-exergy diagram [6]:
Enthalpy-exergy diagrams are very useful and convenient to make a Second Law analysis of Thermodynamic 
systems. Exergy is plotted on the y-axis, with enthalpy on the x-axis. So, exergy changes are measured 
as ordinates in this diagram. Fig. below shows an enthalpy-exergy diagram for helium, drawn by the 
author, which was used to make an exergy analysis of a helium refrigerator [6].
In the enthalpy-exergy diagram, other lines shown are: const. pressure, constant temp, constant density, 
and constant entropy lines.
Another way of writing the exergy balance for components of a steady flow system, such as compressors, 
turbines, throttle valves, heat exchangers etc is as follows[6]:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

9.	 Now, go to Exergy Panel. We see that the exergy calculations are made:
10.	Thus, we see that:
Entropy generated = S_gen_univ = 0.06026 kJ/K
Irreversibility or exergy destroyed = I = 17.906 kJ … Ans.
Exergy difference between states 1 and 2 = Delta_Phi = 84.399 kJ.
Also, note that reversible work, useful work, heat transfer Q_0 etc are available.
Now, exergies at Inlet and exit:
At State 1:
Phi_1 = m1 * {( u1 – u0) – T0 * (s1 – s0) + p0 * (v1 – v0)} = 123.725 kJ…. Ans.
At State 2:
Phi_2 = m2 * {( u2 – u0) – T0 * (s2 – s0) + p0 * (v2 – v0)} = 207.595 kJ…. Ans.
Therefore: Phi_2 – Phi_1 = exergy difference = 207.595 – 123.725 = 83.87 kJ.
This closely matches with the value of Delta_Phi = 84.4 kJ … Ans.

Prob.8.17. A rigid container with 200 L volume is divided in to two equal volumes by a partition. Both 
sides contain nitrogen, one side is at 2 MPa, 300 C, and the other at 1 MPa, 50 C. The partition ruptures, 
and the nitrogen comes to a uniform state at 100 C. Assuming the surroundings are at 25 C, find the 
actual heat transfer and the Irreversibility in the process. [Ref: 2]
TEST Solution:
We shall use TEST to find out the properties at States before and after mixing and then make simple 
calculations to find out heat transfer and exergy loss.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic

Prob.8.27. A well insulated shell & tube heat exchanger is used to heat water (cp = 4.184 kJ/kg.C) in 
the tubes from 20 to 70 C at a rate of 4.5 kg/s. Heat is supplied by hot oil (cp = 1.8 kJ/kg.C) that enters 
the shell side at 170 C at a rate of 10 kg/s. Neglecting the heat loss from the heat exchanger, determine: 
(a) exit temp of oil (b) rate of heat transfer in the heat exchanger, and (c) the rate of exergy destruction.
