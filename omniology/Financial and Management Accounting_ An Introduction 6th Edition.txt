Preface to the sixth edition
Introduction
This book uses the international framework and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as its primary focus. It enables students in their early stages of study
to understand and analyse the published annual reports and ﬁnancial statements of
our largest businesses and public sector institutions. IFRS are now applied in many
aspects of government, local authority and other public sector accounting. Where rele-
vant it also refers to the approach used in small and medium-sized businesses where
the traditions of UK GAAP continue to be applied.
The book is written for the ﬁrst level of undergraduate degree study in accounting
and business studies, or equivalent introductory accounting courses for any pro-
fessional training where an understanding of accounting is a basic requirement. While
UK listed companies apply IFRS in their published ﬁnancial statements, the remainder
of the annual report is governed by UK-based regulations and codes. All UK com-
panies operate under the Companies Act 2006. Their annual reports are inﬂuenced 
by the regulatory process applied to listed companies in the UK. This sixth edition is
thoroughly revised to reﬂect these regulatory changes, particularly the restructuring
of the Financial Reporting Council to take responsibility for the standards previously
issued by the UK Accounting Standards Board.
All ‘Real World’ case studies at the start of each chapter have been updated to
reﬂect changing conditions and particularly the note of caution over ﬁnancial state-
ments that has resulted from the banking and credit crisis of 2008–09. The underlying
pedagogy of previous editions has been retained in response to encouraging com-
ments from reviewers and from users of the book.
As institutions come under increasing scrutiny for the quality of the teaching and
learning experience offered, a textbook must do more than present the knowledge and
skills of the chosen subject. It must make explicit to the students what targets are to be
achieved and it must help them to assess realistically their own achievements of those
targets. It must help the class lecturer prepare, deliver, explain and assess the knowl-
edge and skills expected for the relevant level of study. This is achieved by stating
learning outcomes at the start of each chapter and by ensuring that the chapter head-
ings and the end-of-chapter questions address the stated outcomes.
The management accounting chapters continue the approach of previous editions
in taking some of the newer costing techniques into mainstream discussion, reﬂecting
their increasing acceptance in management accounting practice. Business strategy and
competitive position are recurring themes.
An accompanying website at www.pearsoned.co.uk/weetman provides the lecturer
with a complete resource pack for each chapter. Student handouts containing a skel-
eton outline of each chapter, leaving slots for students to complete; overhead-projector
masters that match the lecture handouts; additional multiple-choice questions and 
further graded questions in application of knowledge and in problem solving; all are
features for this sixth edition.
End-of-chapter questions are graded according to the skills being assessed. There
are tests of retained knowledge, tests of application of knowledge in straightforward

situations and tests of problem solving and evaluation using the acquired knowledge
in less familiar situations.
Overall the aim of the sixth edition is to provide an introduction to ﬁnancial
accounting and management accounting which engages the interest of students and
encourages a desire for further study. It also contributes to developing the generic
skills of application, problem solving, evaluation and communication, all emphasised
by employers.
Subject coverage
Financial reporting is an essential component in the process of communication be-
tween a business and its stakeholders. The importance of communication increases 
as organisations become larger and more complex. Reporting ﬁnancial information to
external stakeholders not involved in the day-to-day management of the business
requires a carefully balanced process of extracting the key features while preserving
the essential core of information. The participants in the communication process cover
a wide range of expertise and educational background, so far as accounting is con-
cerned. The range begins with those who prepare ﬁnancial statements, who may have
a special training in accounting techniques, but it ends with those who may be pro-
fessional investors, private investors, investment advisers, bankers, employee rep-
resentatives, customers, suppliers and journalists.
One very signiﬁcant group of stakeholders in any business is the internal manage-
ment of the organisation. Managers have access to a wealth of detailed ﬁnancial infor-
mation and a responsibility for the careful management of the assets and operations
of the organisation. The way in which the managers of an organisation use ﬁnancial
information is very much contingent on the purpose for which the information is
intended. Management accounting is a specialist area of study within accounting more
generally. Ideally, management accounting and ﬁnancial accounting would coalesce 
if the external users could be given access to all internal information, but that might
damage the competitive position of the business and would probably swamp the
external users in detail.
First-level degree courses in accounting are increasingly addressed to this broad
base of potential interest and this book seeks to provide such a broad base of under-
standing while also supplying a sound technical base for those intending to pursue
specialised study of the subject further. In particular it makes use of the Conceptual
Framework which is used by the International Accounting Standards Board in develop-
ing and reviewing accounting standards. That Framework is intended to help preparers,
users and auditors of ﬁnancial statements to understand better the general nature and
function of information reported in ﬁnancial statements.
Aim of the book
The sixth edition has been updated throughout. It aims to provide a full understand-
ing of the key aspects of the annual report, concentrating in particular on companies
in the private sector but presenting principles of wider application which are relevant
also to organisations operating in the public sector.
In the management accounting section, the book aims to establish a ﬁrm under-
standing of the basic techniques, while recognising that more recent developments in
management accounting are becoming widespread. A contingency approach is adopted
which emphasises that the selection of management accounting techniques is con-
ditional on management’s purpose. To meet this purpose, the management accountant
performs the roles of directing attention, keeping the score and solving problems.
Strategic management accounting is emphasised from the outset so that students are
aware that management accounting must take an outward-looking approach. These

Preface to the sixth edition
xxii
themes are reiterated throughout, concluding with an explanation of the role of 
management accounting in business strategy, particularly e-business in the new econ-
omy. A student who has completed this ﬁrst-level study of management accounting
will be aware of many of the day-to-day practices of management accounting in busi-
ness and the relevance of those practices. It also provides a self-contained, broad intro-
duction to management accounting for business students who do not need to develop
specialist knowledge.
In particular
An international perspective reﬂects the convergence in accounting standards across the
European Union for listed companies. Features speciﬁc to the UK are retained where
these continue to be relevant to other enterprises.
Concepts of ﬁnancial accounting are identiﬁed by applying the principles enunci-
ated by the International Accounting Standards Board in its Conceptual Framework. The
Conceptual Framework emphasises the desirability of meeting the needs of users of
ﬁnancial statements and it takes a balance sheet-oriented approach. That approach 
is applied consistently throughout the book, with some indication of the problems
which may arise when it is clear that the established emphasis on the matching of 
revenues and costs may give a more rational explanation of existing practice.
User needs are explained in every chapter and illustrated by including ﬁrst-person
commentary from a professional fund manager, holding a conversation with an audit
manager. The conversations are based on the author’s research in the area of com-
munication through the annual report.
The accounting equation is used throughout the ﬁnancial accounting section for 
analysis and processing of transactions. It is possible for students who do not seek a
technical specialism to complete the text without any reference to debit and credit
bookkeeping. It is, however, recognised that particular groups of students may wish
to understand the basic aspects of debit and credit bookkeeping and for this purpose
the end-of-chapter supplements revisit, on a debit and credit recording basis, material
already explored in the chapter. Debit and credit aspects of management accounting
are not covered since these are regarded as best reserved for later specialist courses if
the student so chooses.
Practical illustration is achieved by drawing on the ﬁnancial information of a ﬁctitious
major listed company, taking an overview in early chapters and then developing the
detailed disclosures as more speciﬁc matters are explored.
Interpretation of ﬁnancial statements is a feature of all ﬁnancial reporting chapters,
formally brought together in Chapters 13 and 14. The importance of the wider range
of corporate communication is reinforced in Chapter 14. This chapter also includes 
a discussion of some current developments that are under debate in the context of 
international convergence.
A running case study example of the ﬁctitious company Safe and Sure plc provides
illustration and interpretation throughout the chapters. Safe and Sure plc is in the 
service sector. The Instructors’ Manual contains a parallel example, Craigielaw plc, in
the manufacturing sector. On the website there are questions on Craigielaw to accom-
pany most of the chapters.
Self-evaluation is encouraged by setting learning outcomes at the start of each chap-
ter and reviewing these in the chapter summaries. Activity questions are placed at 
various stages throughout each chapter. Self-testing questions at the end of the chapter
may be answered by referring again to the text. Further end-of-chapter questions 
provide a range of practical applications. Group activities are suggested at the end 
of each chapter with the particular aim of encouraging participation and interaction.
Answers are available to all computational questions, either at the end of the book or
on the website.

Preface to the sixth edition
xxiii
A sense of achievement is engendered in the reader of the ﬁnancial accounting 
section by providing a general understanding of the entire annual report by the 
end of Chapter 7. Thereafter speciﬁc aspects of the annual report are explored in 
Chapters 8–12. Lecturers who wish to truncate a ﬁrst-level course or leave speciﬁc
aspects to a later level will ﬁnd Chapters 8–12 may be used on a selective basis.
A spreadsheet approach to ﬁnancial accounting transactions is used in the body of
the relevant chapters to show processing of transactions using the accounting 
equation. The author is ﬁrmly convinced, after years of trying every conceivable approach,
that the spreadsheet encourages students to apply the accounting equation analyt-
ically, rather than trying to memorise T-account entries. Furthermore students now
use spreadsheets as a tool of analysis on a regular basis and will have little difﬁculty
in applying suitable software in preparing spreadsheets. In the bookkeeping supple-
mentary sections, the three-column ledger account has been adopted in the knowledge
that school teaching is moving increasingly to adopt this approach which cuts out
much of the bewilderment of balancing T-accounts. Computerised accounting systems
also favour the three-column presentation with continuous updating of the balance.
Flexible course design
There was once a time when the academic year comprised three terms and we all
knew the length of a typical course unit over those three terms. Now there are
semesters, trimesters, modules and half-modules so that planning a course of study
becomes an exercise in critical path analysis. This text is written for one academic year
comprising two semesters of 12 weeks each but may need selective guidance to 
students for a module of lesser duration.
In ﬁnancial accounting, Chapters 1–4 provide an essential conceptual framework
which sets the scene. For a general appreciation course, Chapters 5 and 6 are practical
so that one or both could be omitted, leading directly to Chapter 7 as a guide to 
published accounts. Chapters 8–12 are structured so that the explanation of principles
is contained early in each chapter, but the practical implementation is later in each
chapter. For a general appreciation course, it would be particularly important to refer
to the section of each chapter which analyses users’ needs for information and 
discusses information provided in the ﬁnancial statements. However, the practical
sections of these chapters could be omitted or used on a selective basis rather than
attempting full coverage. Chapters 13 and 14 are important to all readers for a sense
of interpretation and awareness of the range of material within corporate reports.
Chapter 15 takes the reader through a cash ﬂow statement item-by-item with the
emphasis on understanding and interpretation.
In teaching and learning management accounting various combinations are 
possible, depending on course design and aims. Chapters 16, 17 and 18 provide an 
essential set of basic tools of analysis but thereafter some ﬂexibility is feasible. For
applications in job costing, Chapter 19 provides further material. For concentrating 
on decision making and awareness of business strategy, Chapters 20, 24 and 25 are 
recommended. For concentrating on planning and control, Chapters 21, 22 and 23 give
students experience of the variety of techniques in use.
Approaches to teaching and learning
Learning outcomes
Targets for student achievement in relation to knowledge and understanding of the
subject are speciﬁed in learning outcomes at the head of each chapter. The achieve-
ments represented by these learning outcomes are conﬁrmed against graded questions
at the end of each chapter. The achievement of some learning outcomes may be 
conﬁrmed by Activities set out at the appropriate stage within the chapter.

Preface to the sixth edition
xxiv
Skills outcomes
The end-of-chapter questions test not only subject-speciﬁc knowledge and technical
skills but also the broader general skills that are transferable to subsequent employ-
ment or further training.
Graded questions
End-of-chapter questions are graded and each is matched to one or more learning 
outcomes. Where a solution is provided to a question this is shown by an [S] after the
question number.
A series questions: test your understanding
The A series questions conﬁrm the application of technical skills. These are skills 
speciﬁc to the subject of accounting which add to the specialist expertise of the 
student. More generally they show the student’s capacity to acquire and apply a 
technical skill of this type.
The answers to these questions can be found in relevant sections of the chapter, as
indicated at the end of each question.
B series questions: application
The B series questions apply the knowledge gained from reading and practising the
material of the chapter. They resemble closely in style and content the technical material
of the chapter. Conﬁdence is gained in applying knowledge in a situation that is very
similar to that illustrated. Answers are given in Appendix II or on the website. These
questions test skills of problem solving and evaluation that are relevant to many sub-
jects and many activities in life, especially in subsequent employment. Some initiative
is required in deciding how to apply relevant knowledge and in solving problems.
C series questions: problem solving and evaluation
The C series questions apply the knowledge gained from reading the chapter, but in a
varied style of question. Problem solving skills are required in selecting relevant data
or in using knowledge to work out what further effort is needed to solve the problem.
Evaluation means giving an opinion or explanation of the results of the problem-
solving exercise. Some answers are given in Appendix II but others are on the website
so that they can be used in tutorial preparation or class work.
Group and individual cases
Cases apply knowledge gained from the chapter but they also test communication
skills. Communication may involve writing or speaking, or both. It may require, for
example, explanation of a technical matter to a non-technical person, or discussion
with other students to explore a controversial issue, or presentation of a report to a
business audience.
S series questions in supplementary sections
The S series questions test knowledge of the accounting records system (bookkeeping
entries) to conﬁrm understanding by those who have chosen to study the supple-
mentary bookkeeping sections.
Website
A website is available at www.pearsoned.co.uk/weetman by password access to 
lecturers adopting this book. It contains additional problem questions for each chapter,
with full solutions to these additional questions as well as any solutions not provided
in the book. The website includes basic tutorial instructions and overhead-projector
masters to support each chapter.

Preface to the sixth edition
xxv
Target readership
This book is targeted at a broad-ranging business studies type of ﬁrst-level degree
course. It is intended to support the equivalent of one semester of 12 teaching weeks.
There is sufﬁcient basic bookkeeping (ledger accounts) in the end-of-chapter supple-
ments to make the book suitable for those intending to pursue a specialised study of
accounting beyond the ﬁrst level but the bookkeeping material is optional for those
who do not have such special intentions. The book has been written with under-
graduate students particularly in mind, but may also be suitable for professional and
postgraduate business courses where ﬁnancial reporting is taught at an introductory
level.

1.1 Introduction
Before starting to read this section, write down one paragraph stating what you think the
word ‘accounting’ means. Then read this section and compare it with your paragraph.
There is no single ‘ofﬁcial’ deﬁnition of accounting, but for the purposes of this text
the following wording will be used:
Definition
Accounting is the process of identifying, measuring and communicating financial
information about an entity to permit informed judgements and decisions by users of 
the information.1
This deﬁnition may appear short but it has been widely quoted over a number of years
and is sufﬁcient to specify the entire contents of this introductory textbook.
Taking the deﬁnition word by word, it leads to the following questions:
1 What is the process?
2 How is ﬁnancial information identiﬁed?
3 How is ﬁnancial information measured?
4 How is ﬁnancial information communicated?
5 What is an entity?
6 Who are the users of ﬁnancial information about an entity?
7 What types of judgements and decisions do these users make?
Writing the questions in this order is slightly dangerous because it starts by 
emphasising the process and waits until the ﬁnal question to ask about the use of 
the information. The danger is that accountants may design the process ﬁrst and then
hope to show that it is suitable to allow judgements and decisions by users. This is
what has often happened over many years of developing the process by accountants.
In order to learn about, and understand, accounting by taking a critical approach 
to the usefulness of the current processes and seeing its limitations and the potential
for improvement, it is preferable to reverse the order of the questions and start by
specifying the users of financial information and the judgements and decisions they
make. Once the users and their needs have been identiﬁed, the most effective forms 
of communication may be determined and only then may the technical details of 
measurement and identiﬁcation be dealt with in a satisfactory manner.

Chapter 12 Ownership interest

While they wait for lunch to be served, David turns to the annual report and ﬁnds it
is quite helpful to have Leona alongside him.
DAVID: At the present time nothing seems to excite more comment from the financial 
journalists than the salaries paid to the directors and the options they hold. I have to confess
that it’s something I look for in the annual report. Maybe I’m looking for my future earning
potential! One of my more cynical colleagues says that directors can’t lose on options. If
the share price rises they make money, which we don’t mind because our investment is
rising in value. What happens if the share price falls? The directors take new options at the
lower price and then wait for the market to rise again so that they make a profit! We can’t
do that for our investment.
I always look at the note on share capital to see whether new shares have been issued
during the year. It reminds me to find out the reason. In this case the increase is £0.1m and
the reason is explained in the accounts as being due entirely to the issue of options.
12.6.2
Share premium
It was explained earlier in this chapter that when shares are issued by a company it may
well be that the market price of the shares is greater than the nominal value. What really
matters to the company is the amount of cash contributed by the new shareholders,
but company law insists that the claim of these new shareholders is split into a nominal
amount and a share premium (the amount received in excess of the nominal amount).

DAVID: I look at the share premium account only as a check on the amount of cash raised
by issuing shares during the year. If I add the £3.0m shown in this note to the £0.1m shown
as an increase in nominal value, then I know that £3.1m was raised in total by the issue of
shares. I can check that in the cash flow statement.
12.6.3
Revaluation reserve
Earlier in the chapter the effect of revaluing assets was explained in terms of the
accounting equation. It was also explained that the effects of foreign currency
exchange rates may appear in reserves. The note to the accounts of Safe and Sure plc
appears as follows:

DAVID: I always look at the reserves note to see what is happening to the overall share-
holders’ claim. There is no change in the reserve during Year 6 or Year 7 so does that mean
the company has not revalued the non-current assets in that period?
LEONA: The directors are required to review the valuations at each statement of financial
position (balance sheet) date. So if there is no change in the revaluation reserve there must
have been no change in the value of the assets involved.

Read David’s explanation again and compare it carefully with the financial statements. It is
quite likely that you will not understand everything immediately because the purpose of
this book as a whole is to help you understand published financial statements and we are,
as yet, only at the end of Chapter 4. Make a note of the items you don’t fully understand
and keep that note safe in a file. As you progress through the rest of the book, look back
to that note and tick off the points which subsequently become clear. The aim is to have
a page full of ticks by the end of the book.
4.7 Summary
The IASB’s stated objective of general purpose ﬁnancial reporting is to provide ﬁnan-
cial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential
investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources
to the entity. Those decisions involve buying, selling or holding equity and debt
instruments, and providing or settling loans and other forms of credit.
The two fundamental qualitative characteristics are:
l relevance
l faithful representation.
Each of these has further contributing characteristics. Relevance consists of either pre-
dictive value or conﬁrmatory value, or both. Faithful representation consists of 
neutrality, freedom from error, and completeness. There are four further enhancing
qualitative characteristics. These are:
l comparability
l veriﬁability
l timeliness
l understandability.
The accounting measurement principles that are most widely known in the UK are
found within the Companies Act 2006:
l going concern
l accruals
l consistency
l prudence.
Regulation of ﬁnancial reporting in the UK comes from several sources:
l The IAS Regulation requires all listed groups of companies to prepare ﬁnancial
statements using the system of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB
system). Other companies may choose to follow the IASB system.
l Companies that do not follow the IASB system must comply with UK company
law.
l The Financial Reporting Council regulates accounting and auditing matters under
the authority of UK company law. It sets UK accounting standards and auditing
standards. It also takes action against companies whose annual reports do not 
comply with the relevant accounting system (IASB or UK company law).
l There are Stock Exchange Listing Rules which inﬂuence annual reports of listed
companies.
l The UK tax system charges corporation tax on company proﬁts. Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs (HMRC) starts with the accounting proﬁt in calculating 
the amount of tax payable but there are some special rules of accounting for tax 
purposes.
QUESTIONS
The Questions section of each chapter has three types of question. ‘Test your understanding’
questions to help you review your reading are in the ‘A’ series of questions. You will find the
answers to these by reading and thinking about the material in the book. ‘Application’ questions
to test your ability to apply technical skills are in the ‘B’ series of questions. Questions requiring
you to show skills in problem solving and evaluation are in the ‘C’ series of questions. A letter
[S] indicates that there is a solution at the end of the book.
A
Test your understanding
A1.1
Define ‘accounting’ and identify the separate questions raised by the definition. (Sec-
tion 1.1)
A1.2
The following technical terms appear for the first time in this chapter. Check that you
know the meaning of each. (If you can’t find them again in the text, there is a glossary
at the end of the book.)
Chapter 1 Who needs accounting?
21
l The Statement of Principles of the UK ASB has many similarities to the IASB’s
Conceptual Framework.
l Since January 2005, all listed companies in member states of the EU have been
required by an accounting regulation to use a system of international ﬁnancial
reporting standards (IFRS) set by the IASB.
l Business entities in the UK are either sole traders, partnerships or limited liability
companies.
l Users of accounting information include management, owners, employees, lenders,
suppliers, customers, governments and their agencies and the public interest.
l Stakeholders are all those who might have a legitimate interest in receiving ﬁnan-
cial information about a business because they have a ‘stake’ in it.
l General purpose financial statements aim to meet the needs of a wide range of users.
l The relationship between the owner, as ‘principal’, and the manager, as ‘agent’ is
described in the theory of agency relationships. Accounting information helps to
reduce the potential conﬂicts of interest between principal and agent.

Activities for study groups
Continuing to use the annual reports of companies which you obtained for Chapters 1 and 4,
find the financial statements and the notes to the accounts.
1 Compare the financial statements with the formats and presentations shown in this chapter,
and note any differences which you observe. Look at the notes to the accounts for items
Summaries at the 
end of each chapter
highlight the material
that has been covered
and can be used as a
quick reminder of the
main issues.
Further reading sections
provide full details of
sources of information
referred to in the chapter.
Problem solving and evaluation (Series C) questions require
problem solving skills to select relevant data in order to work out
what further effort is needed to solve the problem. Evaluation
questions ask for your opinion surrounding the results of the
problem solving exercise. Some solutions are found at the end of 
the book but others are in the Resources for Tutors section on the
Instructor Resource Centre at www.pearsoned.co.uk/weetman, 
for use in tutorial preparation or class work.
Activities for study groups at the end of
most chapters are designed to help you apply
the accounting skills and knowledge you have
acquired from the chapter to the real world.
Application (Series B) questions are questions that 
ask you to apply the knowledge gained from reading 
and practising the material in the chapter, and closely
resemble the style and content of the technical material.
Answers are given at the end of the book or in the
Resources for Tutors on the Instructor Resource Centre
at www.pearsoned.co.uk/weetman.
Test your
understanding 
(Series A) questions
are short questions to
encourage you to review
your understanding of the
main topics covered in
each chapter.
A conversation between two managers (consultants)
appears at intervals throughout the text to provide a
valuable insight into the type of interpretative comment
which you may find more taxing. These conversations
allow a more candid discussion of issues and problems
within the subject.

REAL WORLD CASE
Meeting users’ needs
Transport for London: extracts from Annual Report 2012
Transport for London (TfL) is a statutory
corporation established by section 154 of the
Greater London Authority Act 1999 (GLA Act
1999). It is a functional body of the Greater London
Authority (GLA) and reports to the Mayor of London.
Accounting policies (p. 92)
TfL is required to prepare an annual Statement of
Accounts by the Accounts and Audit (England)
Regulations 2011 (the 2011 Regulations), which
those Regulations require to be prepared in
accordance with proper accounting practices.
Highlights (p. 70)
In 2011/12, passenger demand again increased
from the previous year. London Underground (LU) passenger journey growth continued, with
passenger journeys up 5.7 per cent on 2010/11. Service demand on the bus network rose by 2.4 per
cent and Docklands Light Railway (DLR) passenger journeys increased by 10.0 per cent reflecting the
opening of the Stratford International Extension and Westfield Stratford City. Fares increased by an
average 5.6 per cent in January 2012, resulting in an increase in gross fares income to £3,547m.
Gross expenditure before write off of goodwill increased by 5.2 per cent to £6,124m, reflecting the
increased level of activity offset to a degree by the impact of efficiency savings. An exceptional
goodwill impairment of £106m was recognised in relation to the acquisition of the CARE and WARE
groups of companies (former PFI partners of DLR).
The level of capital works being undertaken during 2011/12 remained high reflecting the ongoing
investment in Crossrail and Tube infrastructure required to increase capacity on the network. Capital
expenditure during the year was £2,652m.
Statement of responsibilities (p. 80)
The Corporation is required to:
l Make arrangements for the proper administration of its financial affairs and to secure that one of its
officers (its Chief Finance Officer) has responsibility for the administration of those affairs;
Chapter 1
Who needs accounting?
Shutterstock.com/Stuart Monk

l Manage its affairs to secure economic, efficient and effective use of resources and safeguard its
assets;
l Approve the Statement of Accounts.
Annual Governance Statement (p. 206)
TfL establishes clear channels of communication with all sections of the community and other
stakeholders, ensuring accountability and encouraging open consultation by:
. . .
l Making clear to staff and the public what it is accountable for and to whom
l Publishing, publicising and making generally available an annual report as soon as practicable after
the end of the financial year
l The annual report presenting an objective and understandable account of its activities and
achievements and its financial position and performance
. . .
Discussion points
1 Who might be included in the stakeholders to whom TfL is accountable?
2 To what extent do the ‘Highlights’ meet the needs of users of the financial statements?

Activity 1.1
Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
6
1.1 Introduction
Before starting to read this section, write down one paragraph stating what you think the
word ‘accounting’ means. Then read this section and compare it with your paragraph.
There is no single ‘ofﬁcial’ deﬁnition of accounting, but for the purposes of this text
the following wording will be used:
Definition
Accounting is the process of identifying, measuring and communicating financial
information about an entity to permit informed judgements and decisions by users of 
the information.1
This deﬁnition may appear short but it has been widely quoted over a number of years
and is sufﬁcient to specify the entire contents of this introductory textbook.
Taking the deﬁnition word by word, it leads to the following questions:
1 What is the process?
2 How is ﬁnancial information identiﬁed?
3 How is ﬁnancial information measured?
4 How is ﬁnancial information communicated?
5 What is an entity?
6 Who are the users of ﬁnancial information about an entity?
7 What types of judgements and decisions do these users make?
Writing the questions in this order is slightly dangerous because it starts by 
emphasising the process and waits until the ﬁnal question to ask about the use of 
the information. The danger is that accountants may design the process ﬁrst and then
hope to show that it is suitable to allow judgements and decisions by users. This is
what has often happened over many years of developing the process by accountants.
In order to learn about, and understand, accounting by taking a critical approach 
to the usefulness of the current processes and seeing its limitations and the potential
for improvement, it is preferable to reverse the order of the questions and start by
specifying the users of financial information and the judgements and decisions they
make. Once the users and their needs have been identiﬁed, the most effective forms 
of communication may be determined and only then may the technical details of 
measurement and identiﬁcation be dealt with in a satisfactory manner.
Learning
outcomes
After studying this chapter you should be able to:
l Define, and explain the definition of, accounting.
l Explain what is meant by a conceptual framework.
l Explain the distinguishing features of a sole trader, a partnership and 
a limited company.
l List the main users of financial information and their particular needs.
l Discuss the usefulness of financial statements to the main users.
Additionally, for those who choose to study the supplement:
l Define the basic terminology of business transactions.

Activity 1.2
Chapter 1 Who needs accounting?
7
Reversing the order of the questions arising from the deﬁnition of accounting is the
approach used in this book, because it is the one which has been taken by those seeking
to develop a conceptual framework of accounting.
This chapter outlines in particular the Conceptual Framework of the International
Accounting Standards Board which has been developed for international use in
accounting practice. The chapter explains the nature of three common types of 
business entity and concludes by drawing on various views relating to the users of
accounting information and their information needs.
Because the understanding of users’ needs is essential throughout the entire text,
the chapter introduces David Wilson, a fund manager working for a large insurance
company. In order to balance the demands of users with the restrictions and con-
straints on preparers of ﬁnancial information, the chapter also introduces Leona Rees
who works as an audit manager with an accountancy firm. Both of them will offer
comments and explanations as you progress through the text.
How does this section compare with your initial notions of what accounting means? 
If they are similar, then it is likely that the rest of this book will meet your expectations. 
If they are different, then it may be that you are hoping for more than this book can
achieve. If that is the case, this may be a useful point at which to consult your lecturer,
tutor or some other expert in the subject to be sure that you are satisfied that this book
will meet your personal learning outcomes.
1.2 The development of a conceptual framework
A conceptual framework for accounting is a statement of principles which provides
generally accepted guidance for the development of new reporting practices and for
challenging and evaluating the existing practices. Conceptual frameworks have been
developed in several countries around the world, with the UK arriving a little late 
on the scene. However, arriving late does give the advantage of learning from what
has gone before. It is possible to see a pattern emerging in the various approaches to
developing a conceptual framework.
The conceptual frameworks developed for practical use by the accountancy 
profession in various countries all start with the common assumption that financial
statements must be useful. The structure of most conceptual frameworks is along the
following lines:
l Who are the users of ﬁnancial statements?
l What are the information needs of users?
l What types of ﬁnancial statements will best satisfy their needs?
l What are the characteristics of ﬁnancial statements which meet these needs?
l What are the principles for deﬁning and recognising items in ﬁnancial statements?
l What are the principles for measuring items in ﬁnancial statements?
The most widely applicable conceptual framework originated as the Framework 
for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements produced by the Inter-
national Accounting Standards Board (IASB). This Framework was issued in 1989 and
either reﬂects, or is reﬂected in, national conceptual frameworks of the USA, Canada,
Australia and the UK. In 2010 the Framework was partially updated but it seems un-
likely that a fully revised version will be issued until after some challenging account-
ing issues have been addressed. The thinking in all those documents can be traced to
two discussion papers of the 1970s in the UK and the USA. In the UK, The Corporate
Report2 was a slim but highly inﬂuential document setting out the needs of users and

Activity 1.3

how these might be met. Two years earlier the Trueblood Report3 in the USA had taken
a similar approach of identifying the needs of users, although perhaps coming out
more strongly in support of the needs of shareholders and creditors than of other user
groups. In the UK, various documents on the needs of users have been prepared by
individuals invited to help the process4 or those who took it on themselves to propose
radical new ideas.5
Since January 2005, all listed companies in member states of the European Union
(EU) have been required by an accounting regulation called the IAS Regulation6 to 
use a system of international ﬁnancial reporting standards set by the International
Accounting Standards Board. The UK ASB has been inﬂuential in the development of
these international reporting standards and, over a period of years, has been moving
UK accounting practice closely into line with the international standards. For unlisted
companies and other organisations not covered by the IAS Regulation of the EU, the
UK ASB has a conceptual framework of its own, called the Statement of Principles.7 This
document has many similarities to the IASB’s Conceptual Framework.
Most conceptual frameworks start with the question: Who are the users of financial
statements? Write down a list of the persons or organisations you think would be
interested in making use of financial statements, and their possible reasons for being
interested. Have you included yourself in that list? Keep your list available for comparing
with a later section of this chapter.
1.3 The conceptual framework for financial reporting
The Conceptual Framework is under a process of gradual revision and updating, as a
joint project of the IASB and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) of the
USA. In 2010 a partial revision was published with the following structure:

Chapters 1 and 3 of the Conceptual Framework are written at a general level and a
reader would ﬁnd no difﬁculty in reviewing these at an early stage of study, to gain a
ﬂavour of what is expected of ﬁnancial statements. The remaining sections are a mix-
ture of general principles, which are appropriate to ﬁrst-level study of the subject, and
some quite speciﬁc principles which deal with more advanced problems. Some of
those problems need an understanding of accounting which is beyond a ﬁrst level 
of study. This book will refer to aspects of the various sections of the Conceptual Frame-
work, as appropriate, when particular issues are dealt with. You should be aware,
however, that this book concentrates on the basic aspects of the Conceptual Framework
and does not explore every complexity.
A conceptual framework is particularly important when practices are being 
developed for reporting to those who are not part of the day-to-day running of the

business. This is called external reporting or financial accounting and is the focus of
the Financial Accounting studied in this book. For those who are managing the business 
on a day-to-day basis, special techniques have been developed and are referred to 
generally as internal reporting or management accounting.
Before continuing with the theme of the conceptual framework, it is useful to 
pause and consider the types of business for which accounting information may be
required.

1.4 Types of business entity
The word entity means ‘something that exists independently’. A business entity is a
business that exists independently of those who own the business. There are three
main categories of business which will be found in all countries, although with differ-
ent titles in different ones. This chapter uses the terminology common to the UK. The
three main categories are: sole trader, partnership and limited liability company. This
list is by no means exhaustive but provides sufﬁcient variety to allow explanation of
the usefulness of most accounting practices and their application.
Before reading the next sections, take out a newspaper with business advertisements 
or a business telephone directory, or take a walk down your local high street or drive
round the trading estate. Write down the names of five businesses, shops or other
organisations. Then read the sections and attempt to match your list against the
information provided in each.
1.4.1
Sole trader
An individual may enter into business alone, either selling goods or providing a ser-
vice. Such a person is described as a sole trader. The business may be started because
the sole trader has a good idea which appears likely to make a proﬁt, and has some
cash to buy the equipment and other resources to start the business. If cash is not avail-
able, the sole trader may borrow from a bank to enable the business to start up.
Although this is the form in which many businesses have started, it is one which is
difﬁcult to expand because the sole trader will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to arrange additional
ﬁnance for expansion. If the business is not successful and the sole trader is unable to
meet obligations to pay money to others, then those persons may ask a court of law to
authorise the sale of the personal possessions, and even the family home, of the sole
trader. Being a sole trader can be a risky matter and the cost of bank borrowing 
may be at a relatively unfavourable rate of interest because the bank fears losing its
money.

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
10
From this description it will be seen that the sole trader’s business is very much
intertwined with the sole trader’s personal life. However, for accounting purposes, the
business is regarded as a separate economic entity, of which the sole trader is the
owner who takes the risk of the bad times and the beneﬁt of the good times. Take as
an example the person who decides to start working as an electrician and advertises
their services in a newspaper. The electrician travels to jobs from home and has no
business premises. Tools are stored in the loft at home and the business records are 
in a cupboard in the kitchen. Telephone calls from customers are received on the
domestic phone and there are no clearly deﬁned working hours. The work is inextric-
ably intertwined with family life.
For accounting purposes that person is seen as the owner of a business which 
provides electrical services and the business is seen as being separate from the 
person’s other interests and private life. The owner may hardly feel any great need for
accounting information because they know the business very closely, but account-
ing information will be needed by other persons or entities, mainly the government 
(in the form of HM Revenue and Customs) for tax collecting purposes. It may also be
required by a bank for the purposes of lending money to the business or by another
sole trader who is intending to buy the business when the existing owner retires.
1.4.2
Partnership
One method by which the business of a sole trader may expand is to enter into partner-
ship with one or more people. This may permit a pooling of skills to allow more
efﬁcient working, or may allow one person with ideas to work with another who has
the money to provide the resources needed to turn the ideas into a proﬁt. There is thus
more potential for being successful. If the business is unsuccessful, then the conse-
quences are similar to those for the sole trader. Persons to whom money is owed by
the business may ask a court of law to authorise the sale of the personal property of
the partners in order to meet the obligation. Even more seriously, one partner may be
required to meet all the obligations of the partnership if the other partner does not
have sufﬁcient personal property, possessions and cash. This is described in law as
joint and several liability and the risks have to be considered very carefully by those
entering into partnership.
Partnership may be established as a matter of fact by two persons starting to work
together with the intention of making a proﬁt and sharing it between them. More often
there is a legal agreement, called a partnership deed, which sets out the rights and
duties of each partner and speciﬁes how they will share the proﬁts. There is also part-
nership law, which governs the basic relationships between partners and which they
may use to resolve their disputes in a court of law if there is no partnership deed, or if
the partnership deed has not covered some aspect of the partnership.
For accounting purposes the partnership is seen as a separate economic entity,
owned by the partners. The owners may have the same intimate knowledge of the
business as does the sole trader and may therefore feel that accounting information 
is not very important for them. On the other hand, each partner may wish to be sure
that they are receiving a fair share of the partnership proﬁts. There will also be other
persons requesting accounting information, such as HM Revenue and Customs, banks
who provide ﬁnance and individuals who may be invited to join the partnership so
that it can expand even further.
1.4.3
Limited liability company
The main risk attached to either a sole trader or a partnership is that of losing personal
property and possessions, including the family home, if the business fails. That risk
would inhibit many persons from starting or expanding a business. Historically, as the

Chapter 1 Who needs accounting?
11
UK changed from a predominantly agricultural to a predominantly industrial econ-
omy in the nineteenth century, it became apparent that owners needed the protection
of limited liability. This meant that if the business failed, the owners might lose all the
money they had put into the business but their personal wealth would be safe.
There are two forms of limited liability company. The private limited company has
the word ‘Limited’ (abbreviated to ‘Ltd’) in its title. The public limited company has
the abbreviation ‘plc’ in its title. The private limited company is prohibited by law
from offering its shares to the public, so it is a form of limited liability appropriate 
to a family-controlled business. The public limited company is permitted to offer its
shares to the public. In return it has to satisfy more onerous regulations. Where the
shares of a public limited company are bought and sold on a stock exchange, the 
public limited company is called a listed company because the shares of the company
are on a list of share prices.
In either type of company, the owners are called shareholders because they share
the ownership and share the proﬁts of the good times and the losses of the bad times
(to the deﬁned limit of liability). Once they have paid in full for their shares, the owners
face no further risk of being asked to contribute to meeting any obligations of the busi-
ness. Hopefully, the business will prosper and the owners may be able to receive a
share of that prosperity in the form of a cash dividend. A cash dividend returns to the
owners, on a regular basis and in the form of cash, a part of the proﬁt created by the
business.
If the company is very small, the owners may run the business themselves. If it is
larger, then they may prefer to pay someone else to run the business. In either case, the
persons running the business on a day-to-day basis are called the directors.
Because limited liability is a great privilege for the owners, the company must meet
regulations set out by Parliament in the form of a Companies Act. At present the 
relevant law is the Companies Act 2006.
For accounting purposes the company is an entity with an existence separate from
the owners. In the very smallest companies the owners may not feel a great need for
accounting information, but in medium- or large-sized companies, accounting infor-
mation will be very important for the shareholders as it forms a report on how well
the directors have run the company. As with other forms of business accounting infor-
mation must be supplied to HM Revenue and Customs for tax-collecting purposes.
The list of other users will expand considerably because there will be a greater variety of
sources of ﬁnance, the company may be seeking to attract more investors, employees
will be concerned about the well-being of the business and even the customers and
suppliers may want to know more about the ﬁnancial strength of the company.
Although the law provides the protection of limited liability, this has little practical
meaning for many small family-controlled companies because a bank lending money
to the business will ask for personal guarantees from the shareholder directors. Those
personal guarantees could involve a mortgage over the family home, or an interest in
life assurance policies. The potential consequences of such personal guarantees, when
a company fails, are such that the owners may suffer as much as the sole trader whose
business fails.
1.4.4
Limited liability partnership
A limited liability partnership (LLP) is a corporate body, which means it has a legal
personality separate from that of its members. It is formed by being incorporated
under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000. Any new or existing partner-
ship ﬁrm of two or more persons can incorporate as an LLP. There is no limit on 
the number of members. There must be at least two designated members who take
responsibility for compliance with statutory requirements. The minimum capital
requirement is only £2. An LLP structure may be used by any business seeking to

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
12
make a proﬁt. It has been used in particular by professional ﬁrms such as accountants,
solicitors and architects.
The LLP may be managed like a normal partnership. All members may participate
actively in the management of the business. However the LLP is responsible for the
debts of the business. The individual members do not have the unlimited liability that
they would have in a normal partnership. Taxation procedures are those that apply to
a partnership.
From an accounting perspective in the UK the disclosure requirements are similar
to those of a company. LLPs are required to provide ﬁnancial information equivalent
to that of companies, including the ﬁling of annual accounts with the Registrar of
Companies.

Activity 1.6
Look at the list of five organisations which you prepared before reading this section. 
Did the list match what you have just read? If not, there are several possible explanations.
One is that you have written down organisations which are not covered by this book. 
That would apply if you have written down ‘museum’, ‘town hall’ or ‘college’. These are
examples of public sector bodies that require specialised financial statements not covered
by this text. Another is that you did not discover the name of the business enterprise.
Perhaps you wrote down ‘Northern Hotel’ but did not find the name of the company
owning the hotel. If your list does not match the section, ask for help from your lecturer,
tutor or other expert in the subject so that you are satisfied that this book will continue to
meet your personal learning outcomes.
1.5 Users and their information needs
Who are the users of the information provided by these reporting entities? This sec-
tion shows that there is one group, namely the management of an organisation, whose
information needs are so specialised that a separate type of accounting has evolved
called management accounting. However, there are other groups, each of which may
believe it has a reasonable right to obtain information about an organisation, that do
not enjoy unrestricted access to the business and so have to rely on management to
supply suitable information. These groups include the owners, where the owners are
not also the managers, but extend further to employees, lenders, suppliers, customers,
government and its branches and the public interest. Those in the wider interest
groups are sometimes referred to as stakeholders.

Definition
Stakeholder A general term to indicate all those who might have a legitimate interest in
receiving financial information about a business because they have a ‘stake’ in it.
1.5.1
Management
Many would argue that the foremost users of accounting information about an organ-
isation must be those who manage the business on a day-to-day basis. This group is
referred to in broad terms as management, which is a collective term for all those 
persons who have responsibilities for making judgements and decisions within an
organisation. Because they have close involvement with the business, they have access
to a wide range of information (much of which may be conﬁdential within the organ-
isation) and will seek those aspects of the information which are most relevant to their
particular judgements and decisions. Because this group of users is so broad, and
because of the vast amount of information potentially available, a specialist branch 
of accounting has developed, called management accounting, to serve the particular
needs of management.
It is management’s responsibility to employ the resources of the business in an
efﬁcient way and to meet the objectives of the business. The information needed by
management to carry out this responsibility ought to be of high quality and in an
understandable form so far as the management is concerned. If that is the case, it
would not be unreasonable to think that a similar quality (although not necessarily
quantity) of information should be made available more widely to those stakeholders
who do not have the access available to management.8 Such an idea would be regarded
as somewhat revolutionary in nature by some of those who manage companies, but
more and more are beginning to realise that sharing information with investors and
other stakeholders adds to the general atmosphere of conﬁdence in the enterprise.
1.5.2
Owners as investors
Where the owners are the managers, as is the case for a sole trader or a partnership,
they have no problem in gaining access to information and will select information
appropriate to their own needs. They may be asked to provide information for other
users, such as HM Revenue and Customs or a bank which has been approached to
provide ﬁnance, but that information will be designed to meet the needs of those 
particular users rather than the owners.
Where the ownership is separate from the management of the business, as is the
case with a limited liability company, the owners are more appropriately viewed as
investors who entrust their money to the company and expect something in return,
usually a dividend and a growth in the value of their investment as the company pros-
pers. Providing money to fund a business is a risky act and investors are concerned
with the risk inherent in, and return provided by, their investments. They need 
information to help them decide whether they should buy, hold or sell.9 They are also
interested in information on the entity’s ﬁnancial performance and ﬁnancial position
that helps them to assess both its cash-generation abilities and how management dis-
charges its responsibilities.10
Much of the investment in shares through the Stock Exchange in the UK is carried
out by institutional investors, such as pension funds, insurance companies, unit trusts
and investment trusts. The day-to-day business of buying and selling shares is carried
out by a fund manager employed by the institutional investor. Private investors are 
in the minority as a group of investors in the UK. They will often take the advice of an
equities analyst who investigates and reports on share investment. The fund man-
agers and the equities analysts are also regarded as users of accounting information.

Chapter 1 Who needs accounting?
15
The kinds of judgements and decisions made by investors could include any or all
of the following:
(a) Evaluating the performance of the entity.
(b) Assessing the effectiveness of the entity in achieving objectives (including com-
pliance with stewardship obligations) established previously by its management,
its members or owners.
(c) Evaluating managerial performance, efﬁciency and objectives, including invest-
ment and dividend distribution plans.
(d) Ascertaining the experience and background of company directors and ofﬁcials
including details of other directorships or ofﬁcial positions held.
(e) Ascertaining the economic stability and vulnerability of the reporting entity.
(f) Assessing the liquidity of the entity, its present or future requirements for ad-
ditional working capital, and its ability to raise long-term and short-term ﬁnance.
(g) Assessing the capacity of the entity to make future reallocations of its resources for
economic purposes.
(h) Estimating the future prospects of the entity, including its capacity to pay divi-
dends, and predicting future levels of investment.
(i)
Making economic comparisons, either for the given entity over a period of time or
with other entities at one point in time.
(j) Estimating the value of present or prospective interests in or claims on the entity.
(k) Ascertaining the ownership and control of the entity.11
That list was prepared in 1975 and, while it is a valid representation of the needs 
of investors, carries an undertone which implies that the investors have to do quite 
a lot of the work themselves in making estimates of the prospects of the entity. 
Today there is a stronger view that the management of a business should share more
of its thinking and planning with the investors. The list may therefore be expanded by
suggesting that it would be helpful for investors (and all external users) to know:
(a) the entity’s actual performance for the most recent accounting period and how
this compares with its previous plan for that period;
(b) management’s explanations of any signiﬁcant variances between the two; and
(c) management’s ﬁnancial plan for the current and forward accounting periods, and
explanations of the major assumptions used in preparing it.12
If you look through some annual reports of major listed companies you will see that
this is more a ‘wish list’ than a statement of current practice, but it is indicative of the
need for a more progressive approach. In the annual reports of large companies you
will ﬁnd a section called the Operating and Financial Review (or Business Review).
This is where the more progressive companies will include forward-looking state-
ments which stop short of making a forecast but give help in understanding which of
the trends observed in the past are likely to continue into the future.
1.5.3
Lenders
Lenders are interested in information that enables them to determine whether their
loans, and the related interest, will be paid when due.13
Loan creditors provide ﬁnance on a longer-term basis. They will wish to assess the
economic stability and vulnerability of the borrower. They are particularly concerned
with the risk of default and its consequences. They may impose conditions (called
loan covenants) which require the business to keep its overall borrowing within
acceptable limits. The ﬁnancial statements may provide evidence that the loan covenant
conditions are being met.
Some lenders will ask for special reports as well as the general ﬁnancial statements.
Banks in particular will ask for cash flow projections showing how the business plans
to repay, with interest, the money borrowed.

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
16
1.5.4
Suppliers and other trade creditors
Suppliers of goods and services (also called trade creditors) are interested in infor-
mation that enables them to decide whether to sell to the entity and to determine
whether amounts owing to them will be paid when due. The IASB mentions ‘other
lenders’ as users of ﬁnancial statements.14 Suppliers (trade creditors) are likely to be
interested in an entity over a shorter period than lenders unless they are dependent
upon the continuation of the entity as a major customer. The amount due to be paid to
the supplier is called a trade payable or an account payable.
Trade creditors supply goods and services to an entity and have very little protec-
tion if the entity fails because there are insufﬁcient assets to meet all liabilities. They
are usually classed as unsecured creditors, which means they are a long way down
the queue for payment. So they have to exercise caution in ﬁnding out whether the
business is able to pay and how much risk of non-payment exists. This information
need not necessarily come from accounting statements; it could be obtained by read-
ing the local press and trade journals, joining the Chamber of Trade, and generally 
listening in to the stories and gossip circulating in the geographic area or the industry.
However, the ﬁnancial statements of an entity may conﬁrm the stories gained from
other sources.
In recent years there has been a move for companies to work more closely with their
suppliers and to establish ‘partnership’ arrangements where the operational and
ﬁnancial plans of both may be dovetailed by specifying the amount and the timing of
goods and services required. Such arrangements depend heavily on conﬁdence, which
in turn may be derived partly from the strength of ﬁnancial statements.
1.5.5
Employees
Employees and their representatives are interested in information about the stability
and proﬁtability of their employers. They are also interested in information that 
helps them to assess the ability of the entity to provide remuneration, retirement
beneﬁts and employment opportunities. Employees continue to be interested in 
their employer after they have retired from work because in many cases the employer
provides a pension fund.
The matters which are likely to be of interest to past, present and prospective em-
ployees include: the ability of the employer to meet wage agreements; management’s
intentions regarding employment levels, locations and working conditions; the pay,
conditions and terms of employment of various groups of employees; job security; 
and the contribution made by employees in other divisions of the organisation. Much
of this is quite specialised and detailed information. It may be preferable to supply 
this to employees by means of special purpose reports on a frequent basis rather than
waiting for the annual report, which is slow to arrive and more general in nature.
However, employees may look to ﬁnancial statements to conﬁrm information pro-
vided previously in other forms. The IASB regards employees as persons who might
ﬁnd the general purpose ﬁnancial statements useful. However, the IASB says that such
ﬁnancial statements are not primarily directed to these groups.15
1.5.6
Customers
Customers have an interest in information about the continuance of an entity, es-
pecially when they have a long-term involvement with, or are dependent upon, its pros-
perity. In particular, customers need information concerning the current and future
supply of goods and services offered, price and other product details, and conditions
of sale. Much of this information may be obtained from sales literature or from sales
staff of the enterprise, or from trade and consumer journals.

Activity 1.7
Chapter 1 Who needs accounting?
17
The ﬁnancial statements provide useful conﬁrmation of the reliability of the enter-
prise itself as a continuing source of supply, especially when the customer is making
payments in advance. They also conﬁrm the capacity of the entity in terms of non-
current assets (also called fixed assets) and working capital and give some indication
of the strength of the entity to meet any obligations under guarantees or warranties.
1.5.7
Governments and their agencies
Governments and their agencies are interested in the allocation of resources and,
therefore, in the activities of entities. They also require information in order to regu-
late the activities of entities, assess taxation and provide a basis for national income
and economic statistics.
Acting on behalf of the UK government’s Treasury Department, HM Revenue and
Customs collects taxes from businesses based on proﬁt calculated according to com-
mercial accounting practices (although there are some speciﬁc rules in the taxation 
legislation which modify the normal accounting practices). HM Revenue and Customs
has the power to demand more information than appears in published ﬁnancial state-
ments, but will take these as a starting point.
Other agencies include the regulators of the various utility companies. Examples
are Ofcom16 (the Ofﬁce of Communications) and Ofgem17 (the Ofﬁce of Gas and Elec-
tricity Markets). They use accounting information as part of the package by which
they monitor the prices charged by these organisations to consumers of their services.
They also demand additional information designed especially to meet their needs.
1.5.8
Public interest
Enterprises affect members of the public in a variety of ways. For example, enterprises
may make a substantial contribution to the local economy by providing employment
and using local suppliers. Financial statements may assist the public by providing
information about the trends and recent developments in the prosperity of the entity
and the range of its activities.
A strong element of public interest has been aroused in recent years by environ-
mental issues and the impact of companies on the environment. There are costs
imposed on others when a company pollutes a river or discharges harmful gases into
the air. It may be perceived that a company is cutting corners to prune its own
reported costs at the expense of other people. Furthermore, there are activities of 
companies today which will impose costs in the future. Where an oil company has
installed a drilling rig in the North Sea, it will be expected one day to remove and
destroy the rig safely. There is a question as to whether the company will be able 
to meet that cost. These costs and future liabilities may be difﬁcult to identify and
quantify, but that does not mean that companies should not attempt to do so. More
companies are now including descriptions of environmental policy in their annual
reports, but regular accounting procedures for including environmental costs and
obligations in the ﬁnancial statements have not yet been developed.
Look back to the list of users of financial statements which you prepared earlier in this
chapter. How closely does your list compare with the users described in this section? 
Did you have any in your list which are not included here? Have you used names which
differ from those used in the chapter? Are there users in the chapter which are not in 
your list? If your list does not match the section, ask for help from your lecturer, tutor or
other expert in the subject so that you are satisfied that this book will continue to meet
your personal learning outcomes.

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
18
1.6 General purpose or specific purpose financial 
statements?
Some experts who have analysed the needs of users in the manner set out in the 
previous section have come to the conclusion that no single set of general purpose
financial statements could meet all these needs. It has been explained in the previous
section that some users already turn to special reports to meet speciﬁc needs. Other
experts hold that there could be a form of general purpose ﬁnancial statements which
would meet all the needs of some user groups and some of the needs of others.
This book is written on the assumption that it is possible to prepare a set of general
purpose ﬁnancial statements which will have some interest for all users. The existence
of such reports is particularly important for those who cannot prescribe the infor-
mation they would like to receive from an organisation. That is perhaps because they
have no bargaining power, or because they are many in number but not signiﬁcant in
economic inﬂuence.
Preparers of general purpose ﬁnancial statements tend to regard the owners and
long-term lenders as the primary users of the information provided. There is an expec-
tation or hope that the interests of these groups will overlap to some extent with the
interests of a wider user group and that any improvements in ﬁnancial statements will
be sufﬁcient that fewer needs will be left unmet.18
The primary focus of the Conceptual Framework is on general purpose ﬁnancial state-
ments.19 It takes the view that many users have to rely on the ﬁnancial statements as
their major source of ﬁnancial information. Financial statements should be prepared
with their needs in mind. The Conceptual Framework assumes that if ﬁnancial state-
ments meet the needs of investors, they will also meet the needs of most other users.20
1.7 Stewards and agents
In an earlier section, the needs of investors as users were listed and the word ‘steward-
ship’ appeared. In the days before an industrial society existed, stewards were the 
people who looked after the manor house and lands while the lord of the manor
enjoyed the proﬁts earned. Traditionally, accounting has been regarded as having a
particular role to play in conﬁrming that those who manage a business on behalf of the
owner take good care of the resources entrusted to them and earn a satisfactory proﬁt
for the owner by using those resources.
As the idea of a wider range of users emerged, this idea of the ‘stewardship’ objec-
tive of accounting was mentioned less often (although its inﬂuence remains strong 
in legislation governing accounting practice). In the academic literature it has been
reborn under a new heading – that of agency. Theories have been developed about 
the relationship between the owner, as ‘principal’, and the manager, as ‘agent’. A con-
scientious manager, acting as an agent, will carry out their duties in the best interest
of the owners, and is required by the law of agency to do so. However, not all agents
will be perfect in carrying out this role and some principals will not trust the agent
entirely. The principal will incur costs in monitoring (enquiring into) the activities of
the agent and may lose some wealth if the interests of the agent and the interests of 
the principal diverge. The view taken in agency theory is that there is an inherent
conﬂict between the two parties and so they spend time agreeing contracts which 
will minimise that conﬂict. The contracts will include arrangements for the agent to
supply information on a regular basis to the principal.
While the study of agency theory in all its aspects could occupy a book in itself, the
idea of conﬂicts and the need for compromise in dealing with pressures of demand for,

and supply of, accounting information may be helpful in later chapters in under-
standing why it takes so long to ﬁnd answers to some accounting issues.
1.8 Who needs financial statements?
In order to keep the ﬂavour of debate on accounting issues running through this 
text, two people will give their comments from time to time. The ﬁrst of these is 
David Wilson, a fund manager of seven years’ experience working for an insurance
company. He manages a UK equity portfolio (a collection of company shares) and part 
of his work requires him to be an equities analyst. At university he took a degree in
history and has subsequently passed examinations to qualify as a chartered ﬁnancial
analyst (CFA).21
The second is Leona Rees, an audit manager with a major accountancy ﬁrm. She has
ﬁve years’ experience as a qualiﬁed accountant and had previously spent three years
in training with the same ﬁrm. Her university degree is in accounting and economics
and she has passed the examinations to qualify for membership of one of the major
accountancy bodies.
David and Leona had been at school together but then went to different univer-
sities. More recently they have met again at workout sessions at a health club, relaxing
afterwards at a nearby bar. David is very enthusiastic about his work, which demands
long hours and a ﬂexible attitude. He has absorbed a little of the general scepticism 
of audit which is expressed by some of his fund manager colleagues.
Leona’s main role at present is in company audit and she is now sufﬁciently experi-
enced to be working on the audit of one listed company as well as several private 
companies of varying size. For two years she worked in the corporate recovery depart-
ment of the accountancy ﬁrm, preparing information to help companies ﬁnd sources
of ﬁnance to overcome difﬁcult times. She feels that a great deal of accounting 
work is carried out behind the scenes and the careful procedures are not always 
appreciated by those who concentrate only on the relatively few well-publicised 
problems.
We join them in the bar at the end of a hectic working week.
DAVID: This week I’ve made three visits to companies, attended four presentations of 
preliminary announcements of results, received copies of the projector slides used for five
others that I couldn’t attend, and collected around 20 annual reports. I have a small mound
of brokers’ reports, all of which say much the same thing but in different ways. I’ve had to
read all those while preparing my monthly report to the head of Equities Section on the 
performance of my fund and setting out my strategy for three months ahead consistent
with in-house policy. I think I’m suffering from information overload and I have reservations
about the reliability of any single item of information I receive about a company.
LEONA: If I had to give scores for reliability to the information crossing your desk, I would
give top marks to the 20 annual reports. They have been through a very rigorous process
and they have been audited by reputable audit firms using established standards of 
auditing practice.
DAVID: That’s all very well, but it takes so long for annual reports to arrive after the financial
year-end that they don’t contain any new information. I need to get information at the first
available opportunity if I’m to keep up the value of the share portfolio I manage. The meet-
ings that present the preliminary announcements are held less than two months after the
accounting year-end. It can take another six weeks before the printed annual report appears.
If I don’t manage to get to the meeting I take a careful look at what the company sends me
in the way of copies of projector slides used.

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
20
Activity 1.8
LEONA: Where does accounting information fit in with the picture you want of a company?
DAVID: It has some importance, but accounting information is backward-looking and 
I invest in the future. We visit every company in the portfolio once a year and I’m looking
for a confident management team, a cheerful-looking workforce and a general feeling that
things are moving ahead. I’ll also ask questions about prospects: how is the order book;
which overseas markets are expanding; have prices been increased to match the increase
in raw materials?
LEONA: Isn’t that close to gaining insider information?
DAVID: No – I see it as clarification of information which is already published. Companies
are very careful not to give an advantage to one investor over another – they would be in
trouble with the Stock Exchange and perhaps with the Financial Services Authority if they
did give price-sensitive information. There are times of the year (running up to the year-end
and to the half-yearly results) when they declare a ‘close season’ and won’t even speak to
an investor.
LEONA: So are you telling me that I spend vast amounts of time auditing financial state-
ments which no one bothers to read?
DAVID: Some people would say that, but I wouldn’t. It’s fairly clear that share prices are
unmoved by the issue of the annual report, probably because investors already have that
information from the preliminary announcement. Nevertheless, we like to know that there
is a regulated document behind the information we receive – it allows us to check that
we’re not being led astray. Also I find the annual report very useful when I want to find out
about a company I don’t know. For the companies I understand well, the annual report tells
me little that I don’t already know.
LEONA: I’ll take that as a very small vote of confidence for now. If your offer to help me
redecorate the flat still stands, I might try to persuade you over a few cans of emulsion that
you rely on audited accounts more than you realise.
As a final activity for this chapter, go back to the start of the chapter and make a note 
of every word you have encountered for the first time. Look at the glossary at the end of
the book for the definition of each technical word. If the word is not in the glossary it is
probably in sufficiently general use to be found in a standard dictionary.
1.9 Summary
This chapter has explained that accounting is intended to provide information that is
useful to a wide range of interested parties (stakeholders).
Key points are:
l Accounting is the process of identifying, measuring and communicating ﬁnancial
information about an entity to permit informed judgements and decisions by users
of the information.
l A conceptual framework for accounting is a statement of principles which provides
generally accepted guidance for the development of new reporting practices and
for challenging and evaluating the existing practices.
l The Conceptual Framework of the IASB provides broad principles that guide account-
ing practice in many countries.

QUESTIONS
The Questions section of each chapter has three types of question. ‘Test your understanding’
questions to help you review your reading are in the ‘A’ series of questions. You will find the
answers to these by reading and thinking about the material in the book. ‘Application’ questions
to test your ability to apply technical skills are in the ‘B’ series of questions. Questions requiring
you to show skills in problem solving and evaluation are in the ‘C’ series of questions. A letter
[S] indicates that there is a solution at the end of the book.

l The Statement of Principles of the UK ASB has many similarities to the IASB’s
Conceptual Framework.
l Since January 2005, all listed companies in member states of the EU have been
required by an accounting regulation to use a system of international ﬁnancial
reporting standards (IFRS) set by the IASB.
l Business entities in the UK are either sole traders, partnerships or limited liability
companies.
l Users of accounting information include management, owners, employees, lenders,
suppliers, customers, governments and their agencies and the public interest.
l Stakeholders are all those who might have a legitimate interest in receiving ﬁnan-
cial information about a business because they have a ‘stake’ in it.
l General purpose financial statements aim to meet the needs of a wide range of users.
l The relationship between the owner, as ‘principal’, and the manager, as ‘agent’ is
described in the theory of agency relationships. Accounting information helps to
reduce the potential conﬂicts of interest between principal and agent.

Problem solving and evaluation
C1.1
The following extracts are typical of the annual reports of large listed companies. Which of these
extracts satisfy the definition of ‘accounting’? What are the user needs that are most closely
met by each extract?
(a) Suggestions for improvements were made by many employees, alone or in teams. Annual
savings which have been achieved total £15m. The best suggestion for improvement will
save around £0.3m per year for the next five years.
(b) As of 31 December, 3,000 young people were learning a trade or profession with the com-
pany. This represents a studentship rate of 3.9%. During the reporting period we hired 1,300
young people into training places. This is more than we need to satisfy our employment

needs in the longer term and so we are contributing to improvement of the quality of labour
supplied to the market generally.
(c) During the year to 31 December our turnover (sales) grew to £4,000 million compared to
£2,800 million last year. Our new subsidiary contributed £1,000 million to this increase.
(d) It is our target to pay our suppliers within 30 days. During the year we achieved an average
payment period of 33 days.
(e) The treasury focus during the year was on further refinancing of the group’s borrowings to
minimise interest payments and reduce risk.
(f) Our plants have emission rates that are 70% below the national average for sulphur dioxide
and 20% below the average for oxides of nitrogen. We will tighten emissions significantly
over the next ten years.
C1.2
Explain how you would class each of the following – as a sole trader, partnership or limited
company. List any further questions you might ask for clarification about the nature of the 
business.
(a) Miss Jones works as an interior decorating adviser under the business name ‘U-decide’.
She rents an office and employs an administrative assistant to answer the phone, keep files
and make appointments.
(b) George and Jim work together as painters and decorators under the business name
‘Painting Partners Ltd’. They started the business ten years ago and work from a rented
business unit on a trading estate.
(c) Jenny and Chris own a hotel jointly. They operate under the business name ‘Antler Hotel
Company’ and both participate in the running of the business. They have agreed to share
profits equally.
Activities for study groups (4 or 5 per group)
Obtain the annual report of a listed company. Each member of the group should choose a dif-
ferent company. Most large companies will provide a copy of the annual report at no charge in
response to a polite request – or you may know someone who is a shareholder and receives 
a copy automatically. Many companies have websites with a section for ‘Investor Relations’
where you will find a document file containing the annual report.
1 Look at the contents page. What information does the company provide?
2 Find the financial highlights page. What are the items of accounting information which the
company wants you to note? Which users might be interested in this highlighted information,
and why?
3 Is there any information in the annual report which would be of interest to employees?
4 Is there any information in the annual report which would be of interest to customers?
5 Is there any information in the annual report which would be of interest to suppliers?
6 Find the auditors’ report. To whom is it addressed? What does that tell you about the
intended readership of the annual report?
7 Note the pages to which the auditors’ report refers. These are the pages which are regulated
by company law, accounting standards and Stock Exchange rules. Compare these pages with
the other pages (those which are not regulated). Which do you find more interesting? Why?
8 Each member of the group should now make a five-minute presentation evaluating the 
usefulness of the annual report examined. When the presentations are complete the group
should decide on five criteria for judging the reports and produce a score for each. Does the
final score match the initial impressions of the person reviewing it?
9 Finally, as a group, write a short note of guidance on what makes an annual report useful to
the reader.

Supplement to Chapter 1
Introduction to the terminology of 
business transactions
The following description explains the business terminology which will be encountered fre-
quently in describing transactions in this textbook. The relevant words are highlighted in bold
lettering. These technical accounting terms are explained in the Financial accounting terms
deﬁned section at the end of the book.
Most businesses are established with the intention of earning a profit. Some do so by
selling goods at a price greater than that paid to buy or manufacture the goods. Others
make a proﬁt by providing a service and charging a price greater than the cost to them
of providing the service. By selling the goods or services the business is said to earn
sales revenue.
Proﬁt arising from transactions relating to the operation of the business is measured
by deducting from sales revenue the expenses of earning that revenue.
Revenue from sales (often abbreviated to ‘sales’ and sometimes referred to as ‘turn-
over’) means the value of all goods or services provided to customers, whether for 
cash or for credit. In a cash sale the customer pays immediately on receipt of goods or
services. In a credit sale the customer takes the goods or service and agrees to pay at a
future date. By agreeing to pay in the future the customer becomes a debtor of the
business. The amount due to be collected from the debtor is called a trade receivable
or an account receivable. The business will send a document called a sales invoice to
the credit customer, stating the goods or services provided by the business, the price
charged for these and the amount owing to the business.
Eventually the credit customer will pay cash to settle the amount shown on the
invoice. If they pay promptly the business may allow a deduction of discount for
prompt payment. This deduction is called discount allowed by the business. As an
example, if the customer owes £100 but is allowed a 5% discount by the business, 
he will pay £95. The business will record cash received of £95 and discount allowed 
of £5.
The business itself must buy goods in order to manufacture a product or provide a
service. When the business buys goods it purchases them and holds them as an inven-
tory of goods (also described as a ‘stock’ of goods) until they are used or sold. The goods
will be purchased from a supplier, either for cash or for credit. In a credit purchase
the business takes the goods and agrees to pay at a future date. By allowing the busi-
ness time to pay, the supplier becomes a creditor of the business. The name creditor
is given to anyone who is owed money by the business. The amount due to be paid to
a creditor is called a trade payable or an account payable. The business will receive a
purchase invoice from the supplier describing the goods supplied, stating the price 
of the goods and showing the amount owed by the business.
Eventually the business will pay cash to settle the amount shown on the purchase
invoice. If the business pays promptly the supplier may permit the business to deduct
a discount for prompt payment. This is called discount received by the business. As an
example, if the business owes an amount of £200 as a trade payable but is permitted 
a 10% discount by the supplier, the business will pay £180 and record the remaining
£20 as discount received from the supplier.

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
26
The purchase price of goods sold is one of the expenses of the business, to be
deducted from sales revenue in calculating proﬁt. Other expenses might include wages,
salaries, rent, rates, insurance and cleaning. In each case there will be a document 
providing evidence of the expense, such as a wages or salaries slip, a landlord’s bill for
rent, a local authority’s demand for rates, an insurance renewal note or a cleaner’s time
sheet. There will also be a record of the cash paid in each case.
Sometimes an expense is incurred but is not paid for until some time later. For
example, electricity is consumed during a quarter but the electricity bill does not
arrive until after the end of the quarter. An employee may have worked for a week 
but not yet have received a cash payment for that work. The unpaid expense of the
business is called an accrued expense and must be recorded as part of the accounting
information relevant to the period of time in which the expense was incurred.
On other occasions an expense may be paid for in advance of being used by the
business. For example, a ﬁre insurance premium covering the business premises is
paid annually in advance. Such expenditure of cash will beneﬁt a future time period
and must be excluded from any proﬁt calculation until that time. In the meantime it is
recorded as a prepaid expense or a prepayment.
Dissatisfaction may be expressed by a customer with the quantity or quality of
goods or service provided. If the business accepts that the complaint is justiﬁed it may
replace goods or give a cash refund. If the customer is a credit customer who has not
yet paid, then a cash refund is clearly inappropriate. Instead the customer would be
sent a credit note for sales returned, cancelling the customer’s debt to the business for
the amount in dispute. The credit note would record the quantity of goods or type of
service and the amount of the cancelled debt.
In a similar way the business would expect to receive a credit note from a supplier
for purchases returned where goods have been bought on credit terms and later
returned to the supplier because of some defect.

Chapter 2 A systematic approach to financial reporting: the accounting equation
29
2.1 Introduction
Chapter 1 considered the needs of a range of users of ﬁnancial information and sum-
marised by suggesting that they would all have an interest in the resources available
to the business and the obligations of the business to those outside it. Many of these
users will also want to be reassured that the business has an adequate ﬂow of cash to
support its continuation. The owners of the business have a claim to the resources of
the business after all other obligations have been satisﬁed. This is called the ownership
interest or the equity interest. They will be particularly interested in how that owner-
ship interest grows from one year to the next and whether the resources of the 
business are being applied to the best advantage.
Accounting has traditionally applied the term assets to the resources available to
the business and has applied the term liabilities to the obligations of the business to
persons other than the owner. Assets and liabilities are reported in a ﬁnancial state-
ment called a statement of financial position (also called a balance sheet). The state-
ment of the ﬁnancial position of the entity represents a particular point in time. It may
be described by a very simple equation.
2.2 The accounting equation
The accounting equation as a statement of ﬁnancial position may be expressed as:
Assets
minus
Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
The ownership interest is the residual claim after liabilities to third parties have
been satisﬁed. The equation expressed in this form emphasises that residual aspect.
Another way of thinking about an equation is to imagine a balance with a bucket
on each end. In one bucket are the assets (A) minus liabilities (L). In the other is the
ownership interest (OI).
If anything happens to disturb the assets then the balance will tip unevenly unless
some matching disturbance is applied to the ownership interest. If anything happens
to disturb the liabilities then the balance will tip unevenly unless some matching 
disturbance is applied to the ownership interest. If a disturbance applied to an asset 
is applied equally to a liability, then the balance will remain level.
2.2.1
Form of the equation: international preferences
If you have studied simple equations in a maths course you will be aware that there
are other ways of expressing this equation. Those other ways cannot change the magni-
tudes of each item in the equation but can reﬂect a different emphasis being placed on
the various constituents. The form of the equation used in this chapter is the sequence
which has, for many years, been applied in most statements of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheets) reported to external users of accounting information in the UK. The statements
of ﬁnancial position that have been reported to external users in some Continental Euro-
pean countries and in the USA are better represented by another form of the equation:

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
30
Activity 2.1
Assets
equals
Liabilities
plus
Ownership interest
The ‘balance’ analogy remains applicable here but the contents of the buckets have
been rearranged.
A disturbance on one side of the balance will require a corresponding disturbance
on the other side if the balance is to be maintained.
2.2.2
Flexibility
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has developed a set of account-
ing standards which together create an accounting system which in this book is
described as the IASB system. The IASB offers no indication as to which of the above
forms of the accounting equation is preferred. That is because of the different tra-
ditions in different countries. Consequently, for companies reporting under the IASB
system, the form of the equation used in any particular situation is a matter of prefer-
ence related to the choice of presentation of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet). That is a communication issue which will be discussed later. This chapter will
concentrate on the nature of the various elements of the equation, namely assets, 
liabilities and ownership interest. You should be prepared to ﬁnd different variations
of the accounting equation in different companies’ ﬁnancial statements.
Make a simple balance from a ruler balanced on a pencil and put coins on each side.
Satisfy yourself that the ruler only remains in balance if any action on one side of the
balance is matched by an equivalent action on the other side of the balance. Note also
that rearranging the coins on one side will not disturb the balance. Some aspects of
accounting are concerned with taking actions on each side of the balance. Other 
aspects are concerned with rearranging one side of the balance.
2.3 Defining assets
An asset is deﬁned as: ‘a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from
which future economic beneﬁts are expected to ﬂow to the entity’.1
To understand this deﬁnition fully, each phrase must be considered separately.
2.3.1
Controlled by the entity
Control means the ability to obtain the economic beneﬁts and to restrict the access 
of others. The items which everyone enjoys, such as the beneﬁt of a good motorway
giving access to the business or the presence of a highly skilled workforce in a nearby
town, provide beneﬁts to the business which are not reported in ﬁnancial statements
because there would be considerable problems in identifying the entity’s share of the
beneﬁts. If there is no control, the item is omitted.
The condition of control is also included to prevent businesses from leaving out 
of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) some items which ought to be

in there. In past years, practices emerged of omitting an asset and a corresponding 
liability from a statement of ﬁnancial position on the grounds that there was no effec-
tive obligation remaining in respect of the liability. At the same time, the business
carefully retained effective control of the asset by suitable legal agreements. This prac-
tice of omitting items from the statement of ﬁnancial position was felt to be unhelpful
to users because it was concealing some of the resources used by the business and 
concealing the related obligations.
The strongest form of control over an asset is the right of ownership. Sometimes,
however, the entity does not have ownership but does have the right to use an item.
This right may be very similar to the right of ownership. So far as the user of account-
ing information is concerned, what really matters is the availability of the item to the
entity and how well the item is being used to earn proﬁts for the business. Forms of
control may include an agreement to lease or rent a resource, and a licence allowing
exclusive use of a resource.
2.3.2
Past events
Accounting depends on ﬁnding some reasonably objective way of conﬁrming that the
entity has gained control of the resource. The evidence provided by a past transaction
is an objective starting point. A transaction is an agreement between two parties which
usually involves exchanging goods or services for cash or a promise to pay cash. (The
supplement to Chapter 1 explains basic business transactions in more detail.) Some-
times there is no transaction but there is an event which is sufﬁcient to give this objec-
tive evidence. The event could be the performance of a service which, once completed,
gives the right to demand payment.
2.3.3
Future economic benefits
Most businesses use resources in the expectation that they will eventually generate
cash. Some resources generate cash more quickly than others. If the business manu-
factures goods in order to sell them to customers, those goods carry a future economic
beneﬁt in terms of the expectation of sale. That beneﬁt comes to the entity relatively
quickly. The business may own a warehouse in which it stores the goods before they
are sold. There is a future economic beneﬁt associated with the warehouse because it
helps create the cash ﬂow from sale of the goods (by keeping them safe from damage
and theft) and also because at some time in the future the warehouse could itself be
sold for cash.
The example of the warehouse is relatively easy to understand, but in other cases
there may be some uncertainty about the amount of the future economic beneﬁt. When
goods are sold to a customer who is allowed time to pay, the customer becomes a
debtor of the business (a person who owes money to the business) and the amount of
the trade receivable is regarded as an asset. There may be some uncertainty as to
whether the customer will eventually pay for the goods. That uncertainty does not
prevent the trade receivable being regarded as an asset but may require some caution
as to how the asset is measured in money terms.
Write down five items in your personal possession which you regard as assets. Use the
definition given in this section to explain why each item is an asset from your point of
view. Then read the next section and compare your list with the examples of business
assets. If you are having difficulty in understanding why any item is, or is not, an asset you
should consult your lecturer, tutor or other expert in the subject area for a discussion on
how to apply the definition in identifying assets.

2.4 Examples of assets
The following items are commonly found in the assets section of the statement of
ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of a company:
l land and buildings (property) owned by the company
l buildings leased by the company on a 50-year lease
l plant and equipment owned by the company
l equipment leased (rented) by the company under a ﬁnance lease
l vehicles
l raw materials
l goods for resale
l ﬁnished goods
l work in progress
l trade receivables (amounts due from customers who have promised to pay for
goods sold on credit)
l prepaid insurance and rentals
l investments in shares of other companies
l cash held in a bank account.
Do all these items meet the deﬁnition of an asset? Tables 2.1 and 2.2 test each item
against the aspects of the deﬁnition which have already been discussed. Two tables
have been used because it is conventional practice to separate assets into current 
assets and non-current assets. Current assets are held with the intention of convert-
ing them into cash within the business cycle. Non-current assets, also called fixed
assets, are held for continuing use in the business. The business cycle is the period
(usually 12 months) during which the peaks and troughs of activity of a business form

a pattern which is repeated on a regular basis. For a business selling swimwear, 
production will take place all winter in preparation for a rush of sales in the summer.
Painters and decorators work indoors in the winter and carry out exterior work in the
summer. Because many businesses are affected by the seasons of the year, the business
cycle is normally 12 months. Some of the answers are fairly obvious but a few require
a little further comment here.
First, there are the items of buildings and equipment which are rented under a lease
agreement. The beneﬁts of such leases are felt to be so similar to the beneﬁts of owner-
ship that the items are included in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)
as assets. Suitable wording is used to describe the different nature of these items so

that users, particularly creditors, are not misled into believing that the items belong to
the business.
Second, it is useful to note at this stage that partly ﬁnished items of output may be
recorded as assets. The term ‘work in progress’ is used to describe work of the busi-
ness which is not yet completed. Examples of such work in progress might be: partly
ﬁnished items in a manufacturing company; a partly completed motorway being built
by a construction company; or a continuing legal case being undertaken by a ﬁrm 
of lawyers. Such items are included as assets because there has been an event in the
partial completion of the work and there is an expectation of completion and eventual
payment by a customer for the ﬁnished item.
Finally, it is clear that the relative future economic beneﬁts of these assets have a
wide variation in potential risk. This risk is a matter of great interest to those who use
accounting information, but there are generally no accounting techniques for reporting
this risk directly in ﬁnancial statements. Consequently, it is very important to have
adequate descriptions of assets. Accounting information is concerned with the words
used to describe items in ﬁnancial statements, as well as the numbers attributed to them.
(The narrative description of business risks is explained in Chapter 14, Section 14.10.)
Definitions
An asset is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from which
future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.2
A current asset is an asset that satisfies any of the following criteria:
(a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the entity’s
normal operating cycle;
(b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
(c) it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period;
(d) it is cash or a cash equivalent.3
A non-current asset is any asset that does not meet the definition of a current asset.4
Non-current assets include tangible, intangible and financial assets of a long-term nature.
These are also described as fixed assets.5
2.5 Recognition of assets
When an item has passed the tests of deﬁnition of an asset, it has still not acquired the
right to a place in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). To do so it must
meet further tests of recognition. Recognition means reporting an item by means of
words and amounts within the main ﬁnancial statements in such a way that the 
item is included in the arithmetic totals. An item which is reported in the notes to 
the accounts is said to be disclosed but not recognised.
The conditions for recognition have been expressed as in the following deﬁnition.
Definition
An asset is recognised in the statement of financial position (balance sheet) when:
it is probable that any future economic benefit associated with the asset will flow to the
entity and the asset has a cost or value that can be measured reliably.6
2.5.1
Probability that economic benefits will flow
To establish probability needs evidence. What evidence is sufﬁcient? Usually more
than one item of evidence is looked for. In the case of non-current assets (ﬁxed assets)
which have a physical existence, looking at them to make sure they do exist is a use-
ful precaution which some auditors have in the past regretted not taking. Checking 
on physical existence is not sufﬁcient, however, because the enterprise may have no

Chapter 2 A systematic approach to financial reporting: the accounting equation
35
control over the future economic beneﬁt associated with the item. Evidence of the ben-
eﬁt from non-current assets may lie in: title deeds of property; registration documents
for vehicles plus the purchase invoice from the supplier; invoices from suppliers of
plant and equipment or ofﬁce furniture; a written lease agreement for a computer or
other type of equipment; and also the enterprise’s internal forecasts of the proﬁts it
will make by using these non-current assets. This is the kind of evidence which the
auditor seeks in forming an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements.
For current assets the evidence of future beneﬁt comes when the assets are used
within the trading cycle. A satisfactory sales record will suggest that the present 
inventory (stock) of ﬁnished goods is also likely to sell. Analysis of the time that 
credit customers have taken to pay will give some indication of whether the trade
receivables should be recognised as an asset. Cash can be counted, while amounts
deposited in banks may be conﬁrmed by a bank statement or bank letter. Internal pro-
jections of proﬁt and cash ﬂow provide supporting evidence of the expected beneﬁt
from using current assets in trading activities.
2.5.2
Reliability of measurement
Reliable measurement of assets can be quite a problem. For the most part, this book
will accept the well-tried practice of measuring an asset at the cost of acquiring it,
allowing for any reduction in value through use of the asset (depreciation) or through
it falling out of fashion (obsolescence). The suitability of this approach to measurement
will be discussed in Chapter 14 as one of the main unresolved problems of accounting.
2.5.3
Non-recognition
Consider some items which pass the deﬁnition test but do not appear in a statement
of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet):
l the workforce of a business (a human resource)
l the strength of the management team (another human resource)
l the reputation established for the quality of the product
l the quality of the regular customers
l a tax refund which will be claimable against proﬁts in two years’ time.
These items all meet the conditions of rights or other access, future economic ben-
eﬁts, control and a past transaction or event. However, they all have associated with
them a high level of uncertainty and it could be embarrassing to include them in a
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of one year, only to remove them the 
following year because something unexpected had happened.
All these items fail one of the recognition tests and some fail both. The workforce as
a whole may be reliable and predictable, but unexpected circumstances can come to
all and the illness or death of a member of the management team in particular can
have a serious impact on the perceived value of the business. A crucial member of the
workforce might give notice and leave. In relation to the product, a reputation for
quality may become well established and those who would like to include brand
names in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) argue for the permanence
of the reputation. Others illustrate the relative transience of such a reputation by
bringing out a list of well-known biscuits or sweets of 30 years ago and asking who
has heard of them today. Reliable customers of good quality are valuable to a business,
but they are also ﬁckle and may change their allegiance at a moment’s notice. The tax
refund may be measurable in amount, but will there be taxable proﬁts in two years’
time against which the refund may be claimed?
It could be argued that the assets which are not recognised in the ﬁnancial state-
ments should be reported by way of a general description in a note to the accounts. In
practice, this rarely happens because accounting tries to avoid raising hopes which

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
36
might subsequently be dashed. This cautious approach is part of what is referred to
more generally as prudence in accounting practice.
2.6 Defining liabilities
A liability is deﬁned as: ‘a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the
settlement of which is expected to result in an outﬂow from the entity of resources
embodying economic beneﬁts’.7 This wording reads somewhat tortuously but has
been designed to mirror the deﬁnition of an asset.
The most familiar types of liabilities arise in those situations where speciﬁc amounts
of money are owed by an entity to speciﬁc persons called creditors. There is usually
no doubt about the amount of money owed and the date on which payment is due.
Such persons may be trade creditors, the general name for those suppliers who 
have provided goods or services in return for a promise of payment later. Amounts
due to trade creditors are described as trade payables. Other types of creditors
include bankers or other lenders who have lent money to the entity.
There are also situations where an obligation is known to exist but the amount due
is uncertain. That might be the case where a court of law has found an entity negligent
in failing to meet some duty of care to a customer. The company will have to pay 
compensation to the customer but the amount has yet to be determined.
Even more difﬁcult is the case where an obligation might exist if some future 
event happens. Neither the existence nor the amount of the obligation is known with 
certainty at the date of the ﬁnancial statements. An example would arise where one
company has guaranteed the overdraft borrowing of another in the event of that other
company defaulting on repayment. At the present time there is no reason to suppose
a default will occur, but it remains a possibility for the future.
The deﬁnition of a liability tries to encompass all these degrees of variation and
uncertainty. It has to be analysed for each separate word or phrase in order to under-
stand the full implications.
2.6.1
Present obligation
A legal obligation is evidence that a liability exists because there is another person or
entity having a legal claim to payment. Most liabilities arise because a legal obligation
exists, either by contract or by statute law.
However, a legal obligation is not a necessary condition. There may be a commer-
cial penalty faced by the business if it takes a certain action. For example, a decision to
close a line of business will lead to the knowledge of likely redundancy costs long
before the employees are actually made redundant and the legal obligation becomes
due. There may be an obligation imposed by custom and practice, such as a condition
of the trade that a penalty operates for those who pay bills late. There may be a future
obligation caused by actions and events of the current period where, for example, a
proﬁt taken by a company now may lead to a taxation liability at a later date which
does not arise at this time because of the wording of the tax laws.
2.6.2
Past events
A decision to buy supplies or to acquire a new non-current asset is not sufﬁcient to 
create a liability. It could be argued that the decision is an event creating an obligation,
but it is such a difﬁcult type of event to verify that accounting prefers not to rely too
much on the point at which a decision is made.
Most liabilities are related to a transaction. Normally the transaction involves
receiving goods or services, receiving delivery of new non-current assets such as 

Chapter 2 A systematic approach to financial reporting: the accounting equation
37
Activity 2.3
vehicles and equipment, or borrowing money from a lender. In all these cases there is
documentary evidence that the transaction has taken place.
Where the existence of a liability is somewhat in doubt, subsequent events may help
to conﬁrm its existence at the date of the ﬁnancial statements. For example, when a
company offers to repair goods under a warranty arrangement, the liability exists from
the moment the warranty is offered. It may, however, be unclear as to the extent of the
liability until a pattern of customer complaints is established. Until that time there will
have to be an estimate of the liability. In accounting this estimate is called a provision.
Amounts referred to as provisions are included under the general heading of liabilities.
2.6.3
Outflow of economic benefits
The resource of cash is the economic beneﬁt transferable in respect of most obligations.
The transfer of property in settlement of an obligation would also constitute a transfer
of economic beneﬁts. More rarely, economic beneﬁts could be transferred by offering
a resource such as labour in settlement of an obligation.
Write down five items in your personal experience which you regard as liabilities. Use 
the definition given in this section to explain why each item is a liability from your point 
of view. Then read the next section and compare your list with the examples of business
liabilities. If you are having difficulty in understanding why any item is, or is not, a liability
you should consult your lecturer, tutor or other expert in the subject area for a discussion
on how to apply the definition in identifying liabilities.
2.7 Examples of liabilities
Here is a list of items commonly found in the liabilities section of the statements of
ﬁnancial position (balance sheets) of companies:
l bank loans and overdrafts
l trade payables (amounts due to suppliers of goods and services on credit terms)
l taxation payable
l accruals (amounts owing, such as unpaid expenses)
l provision for deferred taxation
l long-term loans.
The ﬁrst ﬁve items in this list would be classiﬁed as current liabilities because they
will become due for payment within one year of the date of the ﬁnancial statements.
The last item would be classiﬁed as non-current liabilities because they will remain
due by the business for longer than one year.
Definitions
A liability is a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement 
of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying
economic benefits.8
A current liability is a liability which satisfies any of the following criteria:
(a) it is expected to be settled in the entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
(c) it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period.9
A non-current liability is any liability that does not meet the definition of a current
liability.10 Non-current liabilities are also described as long-term liabilities.

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
38
2.8 Recognition of liabilities
As with an asset, when an item has passed the tests of deﬁnition of a liability it may
still fail the test of recognition. In practice, because of the concern for prudence, it is
much more difﬁcult for a liability to escape the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet).
The condition for recognition of a liability uses wording which mirrors that used 
for recognition of the asset. The only difference is that the economic beneﬁts are 
now expected to ﬂow from the enterprise. The conditions for recognition have been
expressed in the following way:
Definition
A liability is recognised in the statement of financial position (balance sheet) when:
l it is probable that any future economic benefit associated with the liability will flow
from the entity and
l the amount of the liability can be measured reliably.11
What kind of evidence is acceptable? For current liabilities there will be a payment
soon after the date of the ﬁnancial statements and a past record of making such pay-
ments on time. For non-current liabilities (long-term liabilities) there will be a written
agreement stating the terms and dates of repayment required. The enterprise will pro-
duce internal forecasts of cash ﬂows which will indicate whether the cash resources
will be adequate to allow that future beneﬁt to ﬂow from the enterprise.
Reliable measurement will normally be based on the amount owing to the claimant.
If goods or services have been supplied there will be an invoice from the supplier 
stating the amount due. If money has been borrowed there will be a bank statement 
or some other document of a similar type, showing the lender’s record of how much
the enterprise owes.
In cases which fail the recognition test, the documentary evidence is likely to be
lacking, probably because there is not sufﬁcient evidence of the existence or the 
measurable amount. Examples of liabilities which are not recognised in the statement
of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) are:
l a commitment to purchase new machinery next year (but not a ﬁrm contract)
l a remote, but potential, liability for a defective product, where no court action has
yet commenced
l a guarantee given to support the bank overdraft of another company, where there
is very little likelihood of being called upon to meet the guarantee.
Because of the prudent nature of accounting, the liabilities which are not recognised
in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) may well be reported in note form
under the heading contingent liabilities. This is referred to as disclosure by way of a
note to the accounts.
Looking more closely at the list of liabilities which are not recognised, we see that
the commitment to purchase is not legally binding and therefore the outﬂow of
resources may not occur. The claim based on a product defect appears to be uncertain
as to occurrence and as to amount. If there has been a court case or a settlement out of
court then there should be a provision for further claims of a similar nature. In the case
of the guarantee the facts as presented make it appear that an outﬂow of resources is
unlikely. However, such appearances have in the past been deceiving to all concerned
and there is often interesting reading in the note to the ﬁnancial statements which
describes the contingent liabilities.
An analysis of some common types of liability is given in Table 2.3.

2.9 Defining the ownership interest
The ownership interest is deﬁned in the Conceptual Framework as equity. Equity is the
residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities.12

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
40
The term net assets is used as a shorter way of saying ‘total assets less total liabil-
ities’. Because the ownership interest is the residual item, it will be the owners of the
business who beneﬁt from any increase in assets after liabilities have been met.
Conversely it will be the owners who bear the loss of any decrease in assets after 
liabilities have been met. The ownership interest applies to the entire net assets. It is
sometimes described as the owners’ wealth, although economists would take a view
that the owners’ wealth extends beyond the items recorded in a statement of ﬁnancial
position (balance sheet).
If there is only one owner, as in the sole trader’s business, then there is no problem
as to how the ownership interest is shared. In a partnership, the partnership agree-
ment will usually state the proﬁt-sharing ratio, which may also be applied to the net
assets shown in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). If nothing is said in
the partnership agreement, the proﬁt sharing must be based on equal shares for each
partner.
In a company the arrangements for sharing the net assets depend on the type 
of ownership chosen. The owners may hold ordinary shares in the company, which
entitle them to a share of any dividend declared and a share in net assets on closing
down the business. The ownership interest is in direct proportion to the number of
shares held.
Some investors like to hold preference shares, which give them a preference
(although not an automatic right) to receive a dividend before any ordinary share 
dividend is declared. The rights of preference shareholders are set out in the articles
of association of the company. Some will have the right to share in a surplus of net
assets on winding up, but others will only be entitled to the amount of capital origin-
ally contributed.
Definitions
The ownership interest is called equity in the IASB Conceptual Framework.
Equity is the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities.
Net assets means the difference between the total assets and the total liabilities of the
business: it represents the amount of the ownership interest in the entity.
2.10 Recognition of the ownership interest
There can be no separate recognition criteria for the ownership interest because it is the
result of recognising assets and recognising liabilities. Having made those decisions
on assets and liabilities the enterprise has used up its freedom of choice.
2.11 Changes in the ownership interest
It has already been explained that the owner will become better off where the net
assets are increasing. The owner will become worse off where the net assets are
decreasing. To measure the increase or decrease in net assets, two accounting 
equations are needed:
At time t = 0
Assets(t0) – Liabilities(t0)
equals
Ownership interest(t0)
At time t = 1
Assets(t1) – Liabilities(t1)
equals
Ownership interest(t1)

Chapter 2 A systematic approach to financial reporting: the accounting equation
41
Taking one equation away from the other may be expressed in words as:
Change in (assets – liabilities)
equals
Change in ownership interest
or, using the term ‘net assets’ instead of ‘assets −liabilities’:
Change in net assets
equals
Change in ownership interest
The change in the ownership interest between these two points in time is a measure
of how much better or worse off the owner has become, through the activities of the
business. The owner is better off when the ownership interest at time t = 1 is higher
than that at time t = 0. To calculate the ownership interest at each point in time requires
knowledge of all assets and all liabilities at each point in time. It is particularly inter-
esting to know about the changes in assets and liabilities which have arisen from the
day-to-day operations of the business.
The term revenue is given to any increase in the ownership interest arising from the
operations of the business and caused by an increase in an asset which is greater than
any decrease in another asset (or increase in a liability). The term expense is given to
any reduction in the ownership interest arising from the operations of the business
and caused by a reduction in an asset to the extent that it is not replaced by a cor-
responding increase in another asset (or reduction in a liability).
The owner or owners of the business may also change the amount of the ownership
interest by deciding to contribute more cash or other resources in order to ﬁnance the
business, or deciding to withdraw some of the cash and other resources previously
contributed or accumulated. The amount contributed to the business by the owner 
is usually referred to as capital. Decisions about the level of capital to invest in the
business are ﬁnancing decisions. These ﬁnancing decisions are normally distinguished
separately from the results of operations.
So another equation may now be derived as a subdivision of the basic accounting
equation, showing analysis of the changes in the ownership interest.
Change in ownership 
equals
Capital contributed/withdrawn by the 
interest
ownership plus Revenue minus Expenses
The difference between revenue and expenses is more familiarly known as proﬁt.
So a further subdivision of the basic equation is:
Proﬁt
equals
Revenue minus Expenses
2.11.1
Revenue and expense
Revenue is created by a transaction or event arising during the operations of the busi-
ness which causes an increase in the ownership interest. It could be due to an increase
in cash or trade receivables, received in exchange for goods or services. Depending 
on the nature of the business, revenue may be described as sales, turnover, fees, com-
mission, royalties or rent.
An expense is caused by a transaction or event arising during the operations of 
the business which causes a decrease in the ownership interest. It could be due to an
outﬂow or depletion of assets such as cash, inventory (stock) or non-current assets
(ﬁxed assets). It could be due to a liability being incurred without a matching asset
being acquired.

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene

Definitions
Revenue is created by a transaction or event arising during the ordinary activities of the
entity which causes an increase in the ownership interest. It is referred to by a variety of
different names including sales, fees, interest, dividends, royalties and rent.13
An expense is caused by a transaction or event arising during the ordinary activities of
the business which causes a decrease in the ownership interest.14
2.11.2
Position after a change has occurred
At the end of the accounting period there will be a new level of assets and liabilities
recorded. These assets and liabilities will have resulted from the activities of the busi-
ness during the period, creating revenue and incurring expenses. The owner may also
have made voluntary contributions or withdrawals of capital as a ﬁnancing decision.
The equation in the following form reﬂects that story:
Assets
minus
Liabilities 
equals
Ownership interest at the start of 
at the end of the period
the period plus Capital contributed/
withdrawn in the period plus Revenue of 
the period minus Expenses of the period
2.12 Assurance for users of financial statements
The deﬁnitions of assets and liabilities refer to expected ﬂows into or out of the busi-
ness. The recognition conditions refer to the evidence that the expected ﬂows in or out
will occur. The directors of a company are responsible for ensuring that the ﬁnancial
statements presented by them are a faithful representation of the assets and liabilities
of the business and of the transactions and events relating to those assets and liab-
ilities. Shareholders need reassurance that the directors, as their agents, have carried out
this responsibility with sufﬁcient care. To give themselves this reassurance, the share-
holders appoint a ﬁrm of auditors to examine the records of the business and give an
opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements correspond to the accounting records
and present a true and fair view. (Chapter 1 explained the position of directors as
agents of the shareholders. Chapter 4 explains the regulations relating to company
ﬁnancial statements and the appointment of auditors.)
Meet David and Leona again as they continue their conversation on the work of the
auditor and its value to the shareholder as a user of accounting information provided
by a company.
DAVID: I’ve now coated your ceiling with apple green emulsion. In return you promised to
convince me that I rely on audited accounting information more than I realise. Here is your
chance to do that. I was looking today at the annual report of a company which is a 
manufacturing business. There is a production centre in the UK but most of the production
work is carried out in Spain where the operating costs are lower. The distribution oper-
ation is carried out from Swindon, selling to retail stores all over the UK. There is an export
market, mainly in France, but the company has only scratched the surface of that market.
Let’s start with something easy – the inventories (stocks) of finished goods which are held
at the factory in Spain and the distribution depot in Swindon.
LEONA: You’ve shown right away how limited your understanding is, by choosing the asset
where you need the auditor’s help the most. Everything can go wrong with inventories
(stocks)! Think of the accounting equation:
Assets −Liabilities = Ownership interest

Chapter 2 A systematic approach to financial reporting: the accounting equation
43
If an asset is overstated, the ownership interest will be overstated. That means the profit
for the period, as reported, is higher than it should be. But you won’t know that because
everything will appear to be in order from the accounts. You have told me repeatedly that
you buy the future, not the past, but I know you look to the current profit and loss account
as an indicator of future trends of profit. And so do all your friends.
DAVID: How can the asset of finished goods inventories be overstated? It’s quite a solid item.
LEONA: There are two types of potential error – the physical counting of the inventory 
and the valuation placed on it. There are two main causes of error, one being carelessness
and the other an intention to deceive. I’ve seen situations where the stocktakers count the
same stack of goods twice because they don’t have a marker pen to put a cross on the
items counted. I’ve also heard of situations where items are counted twice deliberately. We
always attend the end-of-year counting of the inventory and observe the process carefully.
I wish there weren’t so many companies with December year-ends. Counting inventory on
2 January is never a good start to the new year.
DAVID: I suppose I can believe that people lose count but how does the valuation go
wrong? All companies say that they value inventories at cost as the usual rule. How can
the cost of an item be open to doubt?
LEONA: Answering that question needs a textbook in itself. The subject comes under the
heading of ‘management accounting’. Take the goods that you know are manufactured in
Spain. There are costs of materials to make the goods, and labour to convert raw materials
into finished goods. There are also the running costs of the production unit, which are
called the overheads. There is an unbelievable variety of ways of bringing those costs
together into one item of product. How much does the company tell you about all that? 
I know the answer – nothing.
DAVID: Well, I could always ask them at a briefing meeting. I usually ask about the profit
margin on the goods sold, rather than the value of the goods unsold. But I can see that 
if the inventories figure is wrong then so is the profit margin. Do you have a systematic 
procedure for checking each kind of asset?
LEONA: Our magic word is CEAVOP. That stands for:
Completeness of information presented.
Existence of the asset or liability at a given date.
Amount of the transaction is correctly recorded.
Valuation reported for assets and liabilities is appropriate.
Occurrence of the transaction or event took place in the period.
Presentation and disclosure is in accordance with regulations and accounting standards
or other comparable regulations.
Every aspect of that list has to be checked for each of the assets and liabilities you see
in the statement of financial position. We need good-quality evidence of each aspect
before we sign off the audit report.
DAVID: I probably believe that you do a great deal of work with your CEAVOP. But next time
I come round to paint your kitchen I’ll bring a list of the situations where the auditors don’t
appear to have asked all the questions in that list.
2.13 Summary
This chapter has set out the accounting equation for a situation at any one point in time:
Assets
minus
Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
44
Key points are:
l An asset is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from
which future economic beneﬁts are expected to ﬂow.
l A current asset is an asset that satisﬁes any of the following criteria:
(a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the
entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
(c) it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the date of the ﬁnancial 
year-end;
(d) it is cash or a cash equivalent.15
l A non-current asset is any asset that does not meet the deﬁnition of a current asset.
Non-current assets include tangible, intangible and ﬁnancial assets of a long-term
nature. These are also described as fixed assets.
l A liability is a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settle-
ment of which is expected to result in an outﬂow from the entity of resources
embodying economic beneﬁts.
l A current liability is a liability which satisﬁes any of the following criteria:
(a) it is expected to be settled in the entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
(c) it is due to be settled within 12 months after the date of the ﬁnancial year-end.
l A non-current liability is any liability that does not meet the deﬁnition of a current
liability. Non-current liabilities are also described as long-term liabilities.
l The ownership interest is called equity in the Conceptual Framework.
l Equity is the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its 
liabilities.
l Net assets means the difference between the total assets and the total liabilities of
the business: it represents the amount of the ownership interest in the entity.
l Recognition means reporting an item in the ﬁnancial statements, in words and in
amounts, so that the amounts are included in the arithmetic totals of the ﬁnancial
statements. Any other form of reporting by way of note is called disclosure. The
conditions for recognition of assets and liabilities are similar in wording.
l At the end of an accounting period the assets and liabilities are reported in a state-
ment of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). Changes in the assets and liabilities dur-
ing the period have caused changes in the ownership interest through revenue and
expenses of operations. The owner may also have voluntarily added or withdrawn
capital. The ﬁnal position is explained on the left-hand side of the equation and the
movement to that position is explained on the right-hand side:
Assets
minus
Liabilities 
equals
Ownership interest at the start of 
at the end of the period
the period plus Capital contributed/
withdrawn in the period plus Revenue of 
the period minus Expenses of the period
l As with any equation, it is possible to make this version more complex by adding
further details. That is not necessary for the purpose of explaining the basic pro-
cesses, but the equation will be revisited later in the book when some of the prob-
lems of accounting are opened up. The helpful aspect of the accounting equation is
that it can always be used as a basis for arguing a feasible answer. The limitation is
that it cannot give an opinion on the most appropriate answer when more than one
option is feasible.

(b) The amount of net profit for the year.
(c) The amount of the ownership interest at 1 January Year 4.
Activities for study groups
Obtain the annual report of a listed company. From the statement of financial position (balance
sheet) list the items shown as assets and liabilities. (This will require you to look in detail at the
notes to the accounts using the references on the face of the statement of financial position
(balance sheet). Share out the list of assets and liabilities so that each person has four or five
assets and four or five liability items.
1 Separately, using the definitions and recognition criteria, prepare a short statement explaining
why each item on your list passes the tests of definition and recognition. State the evidence
you would expect to see, as auditor, to confirm the expected future inflow of economic ben-
efit from any asset and the expected future outflow of benefit from any liability.
2 Present your explanations to the group and together prepare a list of assets and a separate
list of liabilities in order of the uncertainty which attaches to the expected future benefit.
3 Read the ‘contingent liability’ note, if there is one, to find examples of liabilities which have
not been recognised but have been disclosed. Why will you not find a ‘contingent asset’
note?

Supplement to Chapter 2
Debit and credit bookkeeping
You do not have to read this supplement to be able to progress through the rest of the textbook.
In the main body of each chapter the explanations are all given in terms of changes in elements
of the accounting equation. However, for those who would like to know how debits and credits
work, each chapter will have a supplement putting into debit and credit form the material 
contained in the chapter.
Recording in ledger accounts
The double-entry system of bookkeeping records business transactions in ledger
accounts. It makes use of the fact that there are two aspects to every transaction when
analysed in terms of the accounting equation.
A ledger account accumulates the increases and reductions either in a category 
of business activities such as sales or in dealings with individual customers and 
suppliers.
Ledger accounts may be subdivided. Sales could be subdivided into home sales and
export sales. Separate ledger accounts might be kept for each type of non-current asset,
e.g. buildings and machinery. The ledger account for machinery might be subdivided
as ofﬁce machinery and production machinery.
Ledger accounts for rent, business rates and property insurance might be kept 
separately or the business might instead choose to keep one ledger account to record
transactions in all of these items, giving them the collective name administrative
expenses. The decision would depend on the number of transactions in an accounting
period and on whether it was useful to have separate records.
The managers of the business have discretion to combine or subdivide ledger
accounts to suit the information requirements of the business concerned.
Using the accounting equation
Before entries are made in ledger accounts, the double entry system of bookkeeping
assigns to each aspect of a business transaction a debit or a credit notation, based on
the analysis of the transaction using the accounting equation.
In its simplest form the accounting equation is stated as:
Assets
minus
Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
To derive the debit and credit rules it is preferable to rearrange the equation so that
there is no minus sign.
Assets
equals
Liabilities
plus
Ownership interest
There are three elements to the equation and each one of these elements may either
increase or decrease as a result of a transaction or event. The six possibilities are set out
in Table 2.4.

Chapter 2 A systematic approach to financial reporting: the accounting equation
49
The double-entry bookkeeping system uses this classiﬁcation (which preserves 
the symmetry of the equation) to distinguish debit and credit entries as shown in 
Table 2.5.
It was shown in the main body of the chapter that the ownership interest may be
increased by:
l earning revenue; and
l new capital contributed by the owner;
and that the ownership interest may be decreased by:
l incurring expenses; and
l capital withdrawn by the owner.
So the ‘ownership interest’ section of Table 2.5 may be expanded as shown in 
Table 2.6.
That is all you ever have to know about the rules of bookkeeping. All the rest can
be reasoned from this table. For any transaction there will be two aspects. (If you ﬁnd
there are more than two, the transaction needs breaking down into simpler steps.) For
each aspect there will be a ledger account. Taking each aspect in turn you ask yourself:
Is this an asset, a liability, or an aspect of the ownership interest? Then you ask yourself:
Is it an increase or a decrease? From Table 2.6 you then know immediately whether to
make a debit or a credit entry.
Examples of the application of the rules of debit and credit recording are given in
the supplement to Chapter 5 for a service business and in the supplement to Chapter 6
for a manufacturing business. They will also be used in later chapters to explain how
particular transactions are reported.

Supplement: using the accounting equation to analyse transactions
67
3.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter the accounting equation was developed as a representation 
of the relationships among key items of accounting information: assets, liabilities and
the ownership interest. An understanding of the accounting equation and the various
elements of the equation provides a systematic approach to analysing transactions 
and events, but it gives no guidance as to how the results should be communicated in
a manner which will be helpful and meaningful to users. The accounting equation 
is used in this chapter as a basis for explaining the structure of ﬁnancial statements.
Ideas beyond the accounting equation are required as to what qualities are expected
of ﬁnancial statements.
The various ﬁnancial statements produced by enterprises for the owners and other
external users are derived from the accounting equation. The Conceptual Framework
identiﬁes the purposes of ﬁnancial reporting as producing information about the
Learning
outcomes
After studying this chapter you should be able to:
l Explain the benefits and problems of producing annual financial statements.
l Explain the purpose and structure of the statement of financial position (balance
sheet).
l Explain the purpose and structure of the income statement (profit and loss
account).
l Explain the purpose and structure of the statement of cash flows.
l Comment on the usefulness to users of the financial statements prepared.
Additionally for those who choose to study the supplement:
l Apply the debit and credit form of analysis to the transactions of a short period of
time, summarising them in a list which may be used for preparation of simple
financial statements.

Chapter 3 Financial statements from the accounting equation
53
ﬁnancial position, performance and ﬁnancial adaptability of the enterprise. The three
most familiar primary financial statements, and their respective purposes, are:
Primary financial statement
Purpose is to report
Statement of financial position (balance sheet)
Financial position
Income statement (Profit and loss account)
Financial performance
Statement of cash flows
Financial adaptability
This chapter explains the general shape and content of each of these ﬁnancial 
statements.
3.2 Who is in charge of the accounting system?
Since 2005 two different accounting systems have existed for companies in the UK,
depending on the type of company. When you look at the name of a company listed
on the Stock Exchange, such as Vodaphone, BskyB, Burberry and Marks and Spencer,
you are really looking at a family group of companies all owned by one parent 
company. One set of ﬁnancial statements represents all the companies in the group.
Under the law of the European Union (EU), these group ﬁnancial statements for listed
companies must apply the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) account-
ing system set out by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB system).
Other companies in the UK may choose to follow the IASB system of standards but
there is no requirement to do so. All companies in the UK that do not apply the IASB
system must apply the accounting system set out by the UK Accounting Standards
Board (ASB). Many public bodies in the UK, including central government and local
authorities, now use the IASB system of IFRS.
Fortunately for those studying the subject, the ASB and the IASB have been work-
ing closely together for many years and there are relatively few differences between
the two systems. However, there is a potential difference in the appearance and the
wording of ﬁnancial statements. Companies applying the UK ASB’s accounting system
must use speciﬁcations of the sequence and content of items (called formats of ﬁnancial
statements) set out in UK company law which is based on EU directives. Companies
applying the IASB’s system to their listed group reporting have a choice in how they
present their ﬁnancial statements. As a consequence we are now seeing variety in 
the content and sequence of ﬁnancial statements published in the annual reports of
groups listed on the Stock Exchange. This chapter gives you a ﬂavour of the formats
that you might see in ﬁnancial statements. Where there are differences in words used,
this chapter gives the wording of the IASB system ﬁrst, followed by the wording of
UK company law and ASB standards in brackets. As an example, the description:
income statement (proﬁt and loss account)
means that the IASB system uses income statement in its illustrations of a proﬁt 
statement, while UK law and ASB standards use profit and loss account in their 
illustrations of a proﬁt statement.
3.3 The accounting period
In the far-away days of traders sailing out of Italian ports on three-year voyages, 
the accounting period was determined by the date of return of the ship, when the
accounts could be prepared for the whole voyage. That rather leisurely view of the

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
54
scale of time would not be tolerated in an industrial and commercial society where
there is always someone demanding information. The convention is that businesses
should prepare ﬁnancial statements at least once in every calendar year. That conven-
tion is a requirement of law expressed in the Companies Act 2006 in the case of 
limited liability companies. Where companies have a Stock Exchange listing they are
required to produce an interim report six months into the accounting year. Some 
companies voluntarily produce quarterly reports to shareholders, reﬂecting the prac-
tice of listed companies in the USA. For internal management accounting purposes, a
business may produce reports more frequently (e.g. on a monthly or a weekly basis).
Businesses may choose their accounting date as a time convenient to their activities.
Many companies choose 31 December for the year-end, but others (including many of
the utility companies which were formerly owned by the government) use 31 March.
Some prefer a September or October date after the peak of the summer sales has
passed. Whatever the choice, companies are expected to keep the same date from one
year to the next unless there is a strong reason for changing.
The use of a 12-month accounting period should not be too much of a problem where
the trading cycle ﬁts neatly into a year. If the business is seasonal, there will be a peak
of production to match the seasonal peak of sales and the pattern will be repeated every
year. There could be a few technical problems of deciding exactly how to close the door
on 31 December and whether transactions towards the end of the year are to be included
in that year or carried to the next period. These problems can be dealt with by having
systematic ‘cut-off’ rules. There is a bigger problem for those companies whose trad-
ing cycle is much longer. It could take two years to build a section of a motorway or
three years to build a bridge over a wide river estuary. Such a company will have to
subdivide the work on the main contract so that some can be reported each year.
The use of the 12-month accounting period also causes problems for recognition 
of assets and liabilities. Waiting for the ship to arrive was much safer evidence for the
Venetian traders than hoping it was still aﬂoat or relying on reported sightings. For
today’s business the equivalent situation would be waiting for a property to be sold 
or for a large customer to pay the amount due as a debt. However, in practice the 
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) cannot wait. Notes to the accounts give
additional explanations to help users of ﬁnancial statements evaluate the risk, but it is
all quite tentative. Narrative descriptions of risk are explained further in Chapter 14,
section 14.10.
3.4 The statement of financial position (balance sheet)
The statement of financial position (balance sheet) reﬂects the accounting equation.
Both descriptions are used in this textbook because you will ﬁnd both in use. The
International Accounting Standards Board prefers the term ‘statement of ﬁnancial
position’ while company law in the UK uses the term ‘balance sheet’. You saw in
Chapter 2 that there is more than one way to write the accounting equation. That
means there is more than one way to present a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet). You will ﬁnd throughout your study of accounting that there is often more than
one approach to dealing with an activity or solving a problem. This is the ﬁrst time but
there will be more. It means that you need to be ﬂexible in your approach to reading
and using ﬁnancial statements.
3.4.1
Focus on the ownership interest
One form of the accounting equation focuses on the ownership interest as the result of
subtracting liabilities from assets. The equation is as follows:

Chapter 3 Financial statements from the accounting equation
55
Assets
minus
Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
UK companies who apply this form of the equation will present the statement of
ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) in a narrative form, reading down the page, as follows:
Assets
minus
Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
The assets are subdivided into current assets and non-current assets (deﬁned in
Chapter 2), while the liabilities are subdivided into current liabilities and non-current
liabilities (also deﬁned in Chapter 2). The ownership interest may also be subdivided
to show separately the capital contributed or withdrawn and the proﬁt of the period.
Because current assets and current liabilities are closely intertwined in the day-to-day
operations of the business, they are often grouped close to each other in the statement
of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) (Table 3.1).

Current assets

Current liabilities

Proﬁt of the period
Table 3.1 represents a typical sequence used by UK public companies. Most com-
panies will try to conﬁne the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) to a single
side of A4 paper but there is not much space on one sheet of A4 paper to ﬁt in all the
assets and liabilities of a company. Consequently a great deal of use is made of notes
to the accounts which explain the detail. The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet) shows only the main categories of assets and liabilities.

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
56
Activity 3.1
3.4.2
Balancing assets and claims on assets
Another form of the accounting equation focuses on balancing the assets against the
claims on assets. The claims on assets come from the ownership interest and from 
liabilities of all types. The equation is:
Assets
equals
Liabilities
plus
Ownership interest
UK companies who apply this form of the equation will present the statement of
ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) vertically on one sheet of paper but the sequence 
will be different:
Assets
equals
Liabilities
plus
Ownership interest
In some countries there is a preference for lining up the statement of ﬁnancial pos-
ition (balance sheet) horizontally to match the accounting equation even more closely.
Liabilities
Assets
plus
Ownership interest
Before reading further, make sure that you can explain why each item in the accounting
records is an asset or a liability, as shown in the foregoing list. If you have any doubts,
read Chapter 2 again before proceeding with this chapter.

Table 3.2 shows how this would appear in a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet) based on the ‘ownership interest’ form of the equation. Table 3.3 shows how the
same information would appear in a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)
based on the ‘claims on assets’ form of the equation.
The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) in Table 3.2 is more informative
than the list of assets and liabilities from which it was prepared because it has been
arranged in a helpful format. The ﬁrst helpful feature is the use of headings (shown 
in Table 3.2 in bold) for similar items grouped together, such as non-current assets, 
current assets, current liabilities and non-current liabilities. The second helpful feature
is the use of subtotals (identiﬁed in Table 3.2 by descriptions in italics and shaded) for
similar items grouped together. The subtotals used in this example are those for: total
non-current assets; total current assets; total assets; and total liabilities. There are no
standard rules on use of subtotals. They should be chosen in a manner most appro-
priate to the situation. Brackets round ﬁgures show the ‘minus’ in the accounting
equation.
A person using this statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) can see at a
glance that there is no problem for the business in meeting its current liabilities from
its resources of current assets. The ﬁnancing of the business is split almost equally
between the non-current liabilities and the ownership interest, a split which would not
be regarded as excessively risky by those who lend to businesses. The non-current
assets used as a basis for generating proﬁts from one year to the next are collected
together as a group, although the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) alone
cannot show how effectively those assets are being used. For that, an income state-
ment (proﬁt and loss account) is needed.
The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) in Table 3.3 is again more 
informative than the list of assets and liabilities from which it was prepared because it
has been arranged in a helpful format. It offers a helpful feature in the use of headings
(in bold) for similar items grouped together. It is also helpful in providing subtotals

(identiﬁed by descriptions in italics and shaded) for similar items grouped together.
The subtotals used in this example are those for: total non-current assets and total 
current assets. Some ﬁnancial statements include a subtotal for the current assets less
current liabilities (not current assets). There are no standard rules on use of subtotals.
They should be chosen in a manner most appropriate to the situation.
A person using this statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) can again see at
a glance that there is no problem for the business in meeting its current liabilities from
its resources of current assets. The ﬁnancing of the business is split almost equally
between the non-current liabilities and the ownership interest, a split which would not
be regarded as excessively risky by those who lend to businesses. The non-current
assets used as a basis for generating proﬁts from one year to the next are collected
together as a group, although the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) alone
cannot show how effectively those assets are being used.
3.5 The income statement (profit and loss account)
For many years in the UK, profit and loss account was the only title used for the ﬁnan-
cial statement reporting proﬁt of the period. From 2005 many of those listed groups
following the IASB’s system have chosen to follow an example given by the IASB
which uses the heading income statement, found more commonly in US company
reports. It is not compulsory for listed group companies to use ‘income statement’ and
some retain the ‘proﬁt and loss account’ heading. The income statement (proﬁt and
loss account) reﬂects that part of the accounting equation which deﬁnes proﬁt:
Proﬁt
equals
Revenue minus Expenses

The expenses of a period are matched against the revenue earned in that period.
This is described as the application of the matching concept in accounting.
As with the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet), it is presented in a 
vertical form so that it can be read down the page as a narrative (Table 3.4).
3.5.1
Example of presentation
The accounting records of P. Mason’s legal practice at 30 September Year 5 showed
that the ownership interest could be explained as follows (using brackets to show 
negative items):

Comment
The income statement (proﬁt and loss account) improves on the mere list of con-
stituent items by providing headings (shown in bold) for each main category. As this
is a very simple example, only two headings and one subtotal are required. Headings
and subtotals are most useful where there are groups of items of a similar nature. The
resulting net proﬁt shows how the revenues and expenses have contributed overall to
increasing the ownership interest during the month.
Taking each item of the income statement (profit and loss account) in turn, explain to 
an imaginary friend why each item of revenue and expense is regarded as increasing or
decreasing the ownership interest. If necessary, look back to the definitions of revenue
and expense in Chapter 2. Make sure that you feel confident about the income statement
(profit and loss account) before you move on.
3.6 The statement of cash flows
It was shown in Chapter 1 that liquidity is of interest to more than one user group, but
of particular interest to creditors of the business.
Liquidity is measured by the cash and near-cash assets and the change in those
assets, so a ﬁnancial statement which explains cash ﬂows should be of general interest
to user groups:
Cash ﬂow
equals
Cash inﬂows to the enterprise minus 
Cash outﬂows from the enterprise
The statement of cash flows will appear in a vertical form:
Cash inﬂows
minus
Cash outﬂows
equals
Change in cash assets
In a business there will be different factors causing the inﬂows and outﬂows of 
cash. The enterprise will try to make clear what the different causes are. Subdiv-
isions are commonly used for operating activities, investing activities and ﬁnancing
activities:
l Operating activities are the actions of buying and selling goods, or manufacturing
goods for resale, or providing a service to customers.
l Investing activities are the actions of buying and selling non-current assets for long-
term purposes.
l Financing activities are the actions of raising and repaying the long-term ﬁnance of
the business.
Table 3.6 sets out the basic structure of a basic statement of cash ﬂows.

3.6.2
Comment
The cash ﬂows, listed at the start of section 3.6.1 in the accounting records for the legal
practice, relate to three different types of activity which are brought out more clearly
in the statement of cash ﬂows by the use of headings and subtotals. The headings are
shown in bold and the subtotals are highlighted by italics and shading. The story
emerging from the statement of cash ﬂows is that the owner put in £140,000 and the
bank lent £150,000, providing a total of £290,000 in start-up ﬁnance. Of this amount,
£280,000 was used during the month to pay for non-current assets. That left £10,000
which, when added to the positive cash ﬂow from operations, explains why the cash
resources increased by £15,280 over the month.

It is quite common to compare the increase in ownership claim caused by making
a proﬁt with the increase in the cash resources of a business caused by operations. In
this case the proﬁt is £4,220 (Table 3.5) but the operations have added £15,280 to the
cash assets of the business.
To make the comparison, Table 3.8 takes the income statement (proﬁt and loss
account) of Table 3.5 and sets alongside it the cash ﬂows relating to operations.
Table 3.8 shows that the cash ﬂow from fees was £1,200 less than the fee revenue
earned because some customers had not paid at the month end. This is the amount
shown in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) (Table 3.2) as receivables
for fees. Table 3.8 also shows that expenses of rental, gas, electricity and telephone
amounting to £2,800 in total had not been paid at the month end. These are shown as
trade payables in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). The cash ﬂow
from operations is reduced by the payment for the insurance premium which does not
affect the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) for the month.

Chapter 3 Financial statements from the accounting equation

Activity 3.3
Users of ﬁnancial statements regard both the proﬁt and the cash ﬂow as interesting
items of information. The proﬁt shows the overall increase in ownership claim which
contributes to the overall wealth of the business. The cash ﬂow shows the ability of the
business to survive ﬁnancially through planning the timing and amount of inﬂows
and outﬂows of cash.
3.7 Usefulness of financial statements
Here are Leona and David, still working on Leona’s ﬂat, discussing the usefulness of
ﬁnancial statements.
LEONA: Which financial statement is the most important for you?
DAVID: It has to be the income statement (profit and loss account). Profit creates wealth.
Future profit creates future wealth. I have to make a forecast of each company’s profit as
part of my planning to meet our overall investment strategy. Maybe I should qualify that by
adding that cash flow is also important, especially where there is high uncertainty about
future prospects. We talk about ‘quality of profits’ and regard some types of profit as of
higher quality than others. Cash flow support is one aspect of that quality. We have doubts
about some accounting amounts which don’t have a close relationship to cash. A business
cannot survive if it can’t pay its way.
LEONA: Where does that leave the statement of financial position?
DAVID: I’m not sure. It is a list of resources and claims on those resources. We are share-
holders and so we have a claim on those resources but we don’t think about it to any great
extent because we are concentrating on the going concern aspects of the business, rather
than closing down and selling the assets. The numbers in the statement of financial pos-
ition don’t mean very much because they are out of date.
LEONA: We studied research at university which suggested that cash flow is the answer
and income statements (profit and loss accounts) are too difficult to understand. It was
suggested that the statement of financial position (balance sheet) should show what the
assets could be sold for. I don’t think the ideas had caught on in practice, but they seemed
to have some merits.
DAVID: I like to know the dynamics of the business. I like to see the movements of different
aspects and the interactions. I think I would feel that cash flow alone is concentrating on
only one aspect of the wealth of the business. I suppose the statement of financial position
is a useful check on the position which has been reached as a result of making profits 
for the period. One thing we do look at in the statement of financial position is how much
has been borrowed for use in the business. We don’t like to see that become too high in
comparison with the ownership interest.
LEONA: At least you are admitting to seeing something in the financial statements. I still
have to persuade you that the auditors are important in giving you the reassurance you
obviously obtain.
Analyse your own view of wealth and changes in wealth. Which items would you include
in your personal statement of financial position (balance sheet) today? Which items would
you include in your personal ‘profit or loss’ calculation for the past year? Which items
would you include in your personal statement of cash flows? Has your view of ‘wealth’
been modified as a result of reading these first three chapters? If so, how have your views
changed?

QUESTIONS
The Questions section of each chapter has three types of question. ‘Test your understanding’
questions to help you review your reading are in the ‘A’ series of questions. You will find the
answers to these by reading and thinking about the material in the book. ‘Application’ questions
to test your ability to apply technical skills are in the ‘B’ series of questions. Questions requiring

3.8 Summary
This chapter has explained the structure of the main ﬁnancial statements produced by
business and non-business entities.
Key points are:
l An accounting period of 12 months is common for ﬁnancial reporting.
l The primary financial statements produced by a wide range of entities are the state-
ment of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet), the income statement (proﬁt and loss
account) and the statement of cash ﬂows.
l A statement of financial position (balance sheet) presents ﬁnancial position at a
point in time. The format of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) will
vary depending on which version of the accounting equation is preferred by the
entity preparing the statement.
l An income statement (proﬁt and loss account) presents the performance over a
period of time. The income statement (proﬁt and loss account) presents ﬁnancial
performance by matching revenue and expenses to arrive at a proﬁt of the period.
l A statement of cash flows presents the ﬁnancial adaptability over a period of time.
It explains changes in the cash position over a period caused by operating cash
ﬂows, investing cash ﬂows and ﬁnancing cash ﬂows.
l Since 2005 two different accounting systems (consisting of accounting standards
and legislation) have existed for companies in the UK, depending on the type of
company. The IASB system applies to the group ﬁnancial statements of listed com-
panies. Other companies may choose voluntarily to follow the IASB system. The 
UK ASB system, based on UK law and the standards of the UK ASB, applies to all
companies that do not follow the IASB system.
l The accounting standards of the UK ASB are very similar to those of the IASB.

Activities for study groups
Return to the annual reports your group obtained for the exercise in Chapter 1. Find the 
statement of financial position (balance sheet), income statement (profit and loss account) and
statement of cash flows. Use the outline formats contained in this chapter to identify the main
areas of each of the published statements. Work together in preparing a list of features which
make the formats useful to the reader. Note also any aspects of the presentation which you 
find unhelpful at this stage. (It may be useful to look back on this note at the end of the course
as a collective check on whether your understanding and awareness of annual report items 
has improved.)

Supplement to Chapter 3
Using the accounting equation to 
analyse transactions
In the main body of the chapter the transactions of P. Mason’s legal practice are set out in
summary form and are then presented in ﬁnancial statements. This supplement goes back one
stage and looks at the transactions and events for the month of September which resulted in the
summary and ﬁnancial statements shown in the chapter.
The list of transactions and events is as follows:
Sept. 1
P. Mason deposits £140,000 in a bank account to commence the busi-
ness under the name P. Mason’s legal practice.
Sept. 1
P. Mason’s legal practice borrows £150,000 from a ﬁnance business to
help with the intended purchase of a property for use as an ofﬁce. The
loan is to be repaid in ﬁve years’ time.
Sept. 1
A property is purchased at a cost of £75,000 for the land and £175,000
for the buildings. The full price is paid from the bank account.
Sept. 3
Ofﬁce furniture is purchased from Stylecraft at a cost of £30,000. The
full price is to be paid within 90 days.
Sept. 5
An insurance premium of £540 is paid in advance. The insurance cover
will commence on 1 October.
Sept. 8
An applicant is interviewed for a post of legal assistant. She agrees to
start work on 10 September for a salary of £24,000 per annum.
Sept. 11
Invoices are sent to some clients for work done in preparing contracts
for them. The total of the invoiced amounts is £8,820. Clients are
allowed up to 30 days to pay.
Sept. 19
Cheques received from clients in payment of invoices amount to
£7,620.
Sept. 26
Payment is made to Stylecraft for the amount due for ofﬁce furniture,
£30,000.
Sept. 28
Bills are received as follows: for computer rental and online searches,
£1,500; gas, £100; electricity, £200; and telephone/fax, £1,000.
Sept. 30
Legal assistant is paid salary of £1,800 for period to end of month.
In the supplement to Chapter 2 a table was prepared, based on the account-
ing equation, showing the classiﬁcation used for debit and credit bookkeeping 
entries. As a reminder, the form of the equation used to derive the debit and credit
rules is:
Assets
equals
Liabilities
plus
Ownership interest
As a further reminder, the rules are set out again in Table 3.9. Each of the trans-
actions of P. Mason’s legal practice for the month of September is now analysed in
terms of the effect on the accounting equation and the resulting debit and credit
entries which would be made in the accounting records.

Sept. 8
An applicant is interviewed for a post of legal assistant. She agrees to
start work on 10 September for a salary of £24,000 per annum.
The successful outcome of the interview is an event and there is an expected future
beneﬁt from employing the new legal assistant. The employee will be controlled by
the organisation through a contract of employment. The organisation has a commit-
ment to pay her the agreed salary. It could be argued that the offer of employment,
and acceptance of that offer, create an asset of the human resource and a liability 
equal to the future salary. That does not happen because the recognition conditions 
are applied and it is felt too risky to recognise an asset when there is insufﬁcient 
evidence of the future beneﬁt. Commercial prudence dictates that it is preferable 
to wait until the employee has done some work and pay her at the end of the month
for work done during the month. The accounting process is similarly prudent and 
no accounting recognition takes place until the payment has occurred. Even then it is
the expense of the past which is recognised, rather than the asset of beneﬁt for the
future.
Sept. 11
Invoices are sent to some clients showing fees due for work done in
preparing contracts for them. The total of the invoiced amounts is
£8,820. Clients are allowed up to 30 days to pay.
Earning fees is the main activity of the legal practice. Earning fees makes the owner
better off and is an example of the more general activity of increasing the ownership
interest by creating revenue. The clients have not yet paid and therefore the business
has an asset called a trade receivable (debtor).

£2,800).
The computer rental, online searches, gas, electricity and telephone have been used
up during the period and are all expenses which reduce the ownership interest. They
are unpaid and, therefore, a liability is recorded.

Summarising the debit and credit entries
The formal system of bringing together debit and credit entries is based on ledger
accounts. These are explained in the supplement to Chapter 5. For the present it will
be sufﬁcient to use a spreadsheet (Table 3.10) to show how the separate debit and
credit entries analysed in this supplement lead to the list of items used in the main part
of the chapter as the basis for the ﬁnancial statements presented there.
In the spreadsheet there are dates which correspond to the dates of the foregoing
ten separate analyses of transactions. The debit and credit entries are shown with 
Dr or Cr alongside to distinguish them. For each column all the debit entries are totalled

Activity 3.4
Note: The totals of each column have no particular meaning, but they should always
be equal because of the symmetry of the debit and credit records, and so are useful as
an arithmetic check that no item has been omitted or recorded incorrectly.
Turning the spreadsheet back to a vertical listing, using the debit column for items
where the debits exceed the credits, and using the credit column for items where 
the credits exceed the debits, the list becomes as in Table 3.11. You will see that 
this list is the basis of the information provided about P. Mason’s legal practice in 
the main body of the chapter, except that the debit and credit notation was not used
there.
The most serious problem faced by most students, once they have understood the basic
approach, is that of making errors. Look back through this Supplement and think about
the errors which might have been made. What type of error would be detected by finding
totals in Table 3.11 which were not in agreement? What type of error would not be
detected in this way because the totals would be in agreement despite the error? Types
of error will be dealt with in the supplement to Chapter 5.
and all the credit entries are totalled separately. The surplus of debits over credits (or
credits over debits) is calculated and shown in the ﬁnal line. This allows a summarised
list to be prepared as shown in Table 3.11.
A spreadsheet is useful where there are not too many entries, but ledger accounts
become essential when the volume of information increases.

Going concern
In June 2012 the Sharman Panel of Inquiry published its final report and recommendations on Going
concern and liquidity risks; lessons for companies and auditors. Its recommendations include the
reporting of going concern status:
Recommendation 4
The Panel recommends that, in taking forward its work on reporting under the ECS [Engaging
Company Stewardship initiative], the FRC should move away from a model where disclosures 
about going concern risks are only highlighted when there are significant doubts about the entity’s
survival, to one which integrates going concern reporting with the ECS proposals through seeking 
to ensure that:
a) the discussion of strategy and principal risks always includes, in the context of that discussion,
the directors’ going concern statement and how they arrived at it; and
b) the audit committee report illustrates the effectiveness of the process undertaken by the
directors to evaluate going concern by:

i. confirming that a robust risk assessment has been made; and
ii. commenting on or cross-referring to information on the material risks to going concern which
have been considered and, where applicable, how they have been addressed;
and recommends that the FRC should amend the standards and guidance for directors and auditors
accordingly when the ECS proposals have been finalised.

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
76
4.1 Introduction
The previous chapter used the accounting equation as a basis for explaining the struc-
ture of ﬁnancial statements. It showed that design of formats for ﬁnancial statements
is an important ﬁrst step in creating an understandable story from a list of accounting
data.
The IASB’s stated objective of general purpose ﬁnancial reporting is to provide
ﬁnancial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential
investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources
to the entity. Those decisions involve buying, selling or holding equity and debt
instruments, and providing or settling loans and other forms of credit. Critics of this
objective argue for information being useful to a wide range of users in making 
economic decisions. The IASB’s response is that meeting the needs of investors and
lenders is likely to meet the needs of other users also.1
Information about ﬁnancial position is provided in a statement of financial pos-
ition (balance sheet). Information about performance is provided in an income state-
ment (proﬁt and loss account).2 Information about changes in the cash position is 
provided in a statement of cash flows. These three statements were explained in 
outline in Chapter 3. Information about changes in equity is also provided in a separate
statement, described in Chapter 12. Notes to the ﬁnancial statements provide additional
information relevant to the needs of users. These notes may include information about
risks and uncertainties relating to assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.3
4.2 Qualitative characteristics of financial statements
The IASB Conceptual Framework sets out qualitative characteristics that make the infor-
mation provided in ﬁnancial statements useful to users. The two fundamental quali-
tative characteristics are:
l relevance
l faithful representation.4
The fundamental qualitative characteristics of relevance and faithful representation
have further component characteristics:
l relevance
– predictive value
– conﬁrmatory value
Learning
outcomes
After studying this chapter you should be able to:
l List and explain the qualitative characteristics desirable in financial statements.
l Explain the approach to measurement used in financial statements.
l Explain why there is more than one view on the role of prudence in accounting.
l Understand and explain how and why financial reporting is regulated or
influenced by external authorities.
l Be aware of the process by which financial statements are reviewed by an
investor.

Chapter 4 Ensuring the quality of financial statements
77
l faithful representation
– neutrality
– freedom from error
– completeness.
A general quality of materiality applies across these fundamental characteristics.
There are four further characteristics which are described as ‘enhancing qualitative
characteristics’. These are:
l comparability
l veriﬁability
l timeliness
l understandability.
Each of these characteristics is now described.
4.2.1
Relevance5
Financial information is relevant if it is capable of making a difference in the decisions
made by users. Even when users already know the information, or they receive the
information but choose not to use it, it is still capable of making a difference. Preparers
do not have to show that the information actually did make a difference. The infor-
mation is capable of making a difference if it has predictive value, or conﬁrmatory
value, or both.
Predictive value6
Financial information has predictive value if it can be used as an input to processes
employed by users to predict future outcomes. The information could be a forecast
provided by the user. Alternatively it could be information that others, such as
investors or ﬁnancial analysts, use as input data for their own predictions.
Confirmatory value7
Financial information has conﬁrmatory value if it provides feedback about (conﬁrms
or changes) previous evaluations.
Example
A company provides information about revenue (sales) in its income statement.
Investors use this information to predict future trends of revenue for that company.
Based on these predictions the investors buy shares in the company. In subsequent
years the company provides further information about revenue. The investors are able
to conﬁrm the predictions they made previously. Information about revenue (sales) is
therefore relevant information.
4.2.2
Faithful representation8
To be useful, ﬁnancial information must faithfully represent the economic phenomena
that it purports to represent. The use of the words ‘economic phenomena’ sounds
scary – a single phenomenon is worrying enough but several pheonomena together
sound worse. The easiest way to think of this is to substitute for ‘economic phenomena’
the wording ‘economic events that can be observed’. An economic event could be a
transaction, such as where an asset is purchased for cash. An economic event could be
a change in value, such as where a plot of land falls in value through contamination
being discovered. Financial information can be used to report both of those economic
events.

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
78
Faithful representation ideally requires the ﬁnancial information to have three 
characteristics. It will be complete, neutral and free from error. The IASB acknowl-
edges that perfection is seldom, if ever, achievable.
Complete9
A complete depiction includes all information necessary for a user to understand what
is being reported. This includes the words used to describe the item, and any notes of
explanation that help the reader to understand. We will see in later chapters that words
and numbers in ﬁnancial statements are often supported by explanations and notes.
Neutral10
Financial information that is neutral has no bias in the selection or presentation of 
that information. The Conceptual Framework says that a neutral depiction of ﬁnancial
information is not slanted, weighted, emphasised, de-emphasised or otherwise manipu-
lated to increase the probability that such formation will be received favourably or
unfavourably by users. It uses the word ‘depiction’ to cover words as well as numbers
and also the location and prominence of information. Preparers who want to give a
favourable information might consistently choose the upper end of range of estimated
values. Even if there was no bias in the valuation, preparers might use confusing
words, or different sized fonts, or different colours, to distract users away from bad
news information. Actions of these kinds could lead to bias and non-neutral depiction.
Free from error11
‘Free from error’ means there are no errors or omissions in the description of the phenom-
enon, and the process used to produce the reported information has been selected 
and applied with no errors in the process. It does not mean the ﬁnancial statements are
totally accurate. Preparers should make their best efforts but they will not have cer-
tainty about all economic events. There may be a list of accounts receivable (customers
given credit who have not yet paid). It is likely that some of the accounts receivable
will not be received but all the preparer can do is make an estimate for non-recovery.
Equipment depreciates in value but the preparer can only estimate depreciation. It
cannot be measured with total accuracy.
4.2.3
Materiality12
Information is material if omitting it or misstating it could inﬂuence decisions that
users make on the basis of ﬁnancial formation about a speciﬁc reporting entity. The
measure of materiality is speciﬁc to the entity and is linked to relevance. The IASB
does not specify a quantitative threshold for materiality and does not provide any
speciﬁc guidance. It is for preparers of ﬁnancial information to decide what is material
when they prepare that information.
For example, it might be the case that in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet) a company gives separate headings for inventory of raw materials and inven-
tory of work-in-progress. This is because the company knows that investors and
lenders are interested in the materially different types of risk attached to these two
types of inventory. However the inventory of ﬁnished goods is given as a single item
with no separation into the types of ﬁnished goods. That is because the company
knows that investors see no material differences of risk in the types of ﬁnished goods;
it is the overall amount that is of material interest.
4.2.4
Enhancing qualitative characteristics
The enhancing qualitative characteristics are: comparability; veriﬁability; timeliness;
and understandability.

Chapter 4 Ensuring the quality of financial statements
79
Comparability13
Comparability enables users to identify and understand similarities in, and differences
among, items. Consistency refers to the use of the same methods for the same items,
either from period to period within a reporting entity or in a single period across en-
tities. Comparability is the goal; consistency helps to achieve that goal. Does this mean
that everything has to be treated in exactly the same way? The Conceptual Framework
notes that comparability is not uniformity. For information to be comparable, like
things must look alike and different things must look different. Comparability is not
enhanced by making unlike things look alike any more than it is enhanced by making
like things look different.
To test this idea, ﬁnd statements of ﬁnancial position for two companies. Com-
pare the way in which non-current assets are reported. Can you see similarities? 
Can you see differences? Do you think the ﬁnancial statements meet the test of 
comparability?
Verifiability14
Veriﬁability means that different knowledgeable and independent observers could
reach consensus (broad agreement), although not necessarily complete agreement,
that a particular depiction is a faithful representation. Direct veriﬁcation is usually 
carried out by auditors on behalf of investors. Auditors have access to information
underlying the ﬁnancial statements. Other users might verify information by reference
to other external sources or by comparisons. Preparers can help users by disclosing the
assumptions on which ﬁnancial information is based.
Timeliness15
Timeliness means having information available to decision-makers in time to be cap-
able of inﬂuencing their decisions. Generally, the older the information is the less 
useful it is. However, some information may continue to be timely long after the end
of a reporting period because, for example, some users may need to identify and
assess trends. You will see in company annual reports that there are tables of 5-year
trends as well as the most recent ﬁnancial information. National regulators know that
timeliness is important and often impose time deadlines for reporting, particularly
where companies have a stock market listing.
Understandability16
Financial information is understandable if it is presented clearly and concisely, using
recognisable classiﬁcation and descriptions. That seems obvious but the Conceptual
Framework makes it explicit. There is also a warning that complex transactions may be
difﬁcult to understand because they are complex. Financial information cannot take
away that type of complexity. All it can do is try to make the complexity understandable
by clear descriptions. One very signiﬁcant assumption in the Conceptual Framework is
that users have a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and will
review and analyse the information diligently. Even then such persons may some-
times need to take advice on complex matters.
4.2.5
Cost constraint on useful financial reporting17
Reporting ﬁnancial information imposes costs, and it is important that those costs 
are justiﬁed by the beneﬁts of reporting that information. The cost to preparers is 
eventually born by investors in reduced proﬁts. The beneﬁts are seen in more efﬁcient
operation of the capital markets. The standard setter has to balance such costs and
beneﬁts in developing accounting standards.

4.2.6
Other characteristics of financial information
When the IASB revised its Conceptual Framework in 2010 it omitted some character-
istics that appeared in the original 1989 version. However you may still ﬁnd these
terms used in discussion of accounting. In particular you may hear about prudence,
reliability and substance over form. In all three cases, during the discussion stage
leading to the 2010 Conceptual Framework there were some strong objections to the
omission. The reasons given for omission are explained in the following sections.
Prudence18
The preparers of ﬁnancial statements have to contend with uncertainty surrounding
many events and circumstances. The existence of uncertainties is recognised by the
disclosure of their nature and extent and by the exercise of prudence in the preparation
of the ﬁnancial statements. Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the 
exercise of the judgements needed in making the estimates required under conditions
of uncertainty, such that gains and assets are not overstated and losses and liabilities
are not understated.
This guidance was provided in the 1989 version of the IASB Framework. It has been
removed from the 2010 version because the standard setters concluded that describ-
ing prudence or conservatism as a qualitative characteristic or a desirable response to
uncertainty would conﬂict with the quality of neutrality. They felt that encouraging
preparers to be prudent was likely to lead to a bias in the reported ﬁnancial position
and ﬁnancial performance. Introducing biased understatement of assets (or overstate-
ment of liabilities) in one period frequently leads to overstating ﬁnancial performance
in later periods – a result that cannot be described as prudent.19
Reliability20
In the IASB Framework (1989) reliability was deﬁned as:
Information has the quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can
be depended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent
or could reasonably be expected to represent.
This characteristic sat alongside reliability as a principal characteristic. It has been
replaced in the 2010 version by ‘faithful representation’. The standard setters explained
that when they consulted on the changes they found different respondents had dif-
ferent interpretations of ‘reliability’. Some thought it meant freedom from error, 
others thought it meant veriﬁability. The standard setters tried to clarify the meaning
of reliability but eventually concluded that ‘faithful representation’ gave the clearest
understanding of what reliability is intended to mean.21
Substance over form22
The IASB Framework (1989) made clear that if information is to meet the test of faithful
representation, then the method of accounting must reﬂect the substance of the econ-
omic reality of the transaction and not merely its legal form.
For example, a company has sold its buildings to a bank to raise cash and then pays
rent for the same buildings for the purpose of continued occupation. The company
carries all the risks and problems (such as repairs and insurance) that an owner would
carry. One view is that the commercial substance of that sequence of transactions is
comparable to retaining ownership. Another view is that the legal form of the trans-
action is a sale. The characteristic of substance over form requires that the information
in the ﬁnancial statements should show the commercial substance of the situation.
This characteristic is omitted in the 2010 Conceptual Framework because the standard
setters think that any attempt to represent legal form in a way that differs from the
economic substance of the underlying economic phenomenon could not result in a

Chapter 4 Ensuring the quality of financial statements
81
faithful representation. Accordingly, it is not necessary to be explicit. To state that sub-
stance over form is a component of faithful representation would be like repeating the
same idea.23
4.3 Measurement in financial statements
You have seen in Chapter 2, sections 2.5 and 2.8, that the recognition of assets and 
liability requires reliability of measurement. You have seen in Chapter 3 the methods
of presentation of accounting information containing numbers that represent measure-
ment. We now need to know more about the accounting measurement principles 
that establish reliability and about the disclosure of information that allows users of
ﬁnancial statements to understand the measurement process.
The accounting measurement principles that are most widely known in the UK are
found within the Companies Act 2006:24
l going concern
l accruals
l consistency
l prudence.
The IASB Conceptual Framework refers to the accrual basis as a means of reﬂecting
ﬁnancial performance and to going concern as an ‘underlying assumption’ in the
preparation of ﬁnancial statements. Prudence is not discussed. Consistency is an
aspect of comparability.
4.3.1
Going concern
Definition
The financial statements are normally prepared on the assumption that an entity is a going
concern and will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Hence, it is assumed
that the entity has neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or curtail materially the
scale of its operations; if such an intention or need exists the financial statements may
have to be prepared on a different basis and, if so, the basis used is disclosed.25
The UK Companies Act statement on going concern is rather like a crossword clue,
in being short and enigmatic. It states: ‘The company shall be presumed to be carrying
on business as a going concern.’
The Financial Reporting Council provides a practical guide for directors in Going
Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009, published in
October 2009. It took effect for accounting periods ending on or after 31 December
2009. The guidance is based on three principles covering: the process which directors
should follow when assessing going concern; the period covered by the assessment;
and the disclosures on going concern and liquidity risk. The guidance applies to all
companies and in particular addresses the statement about going concern that must be
made by directors of listed companies in their annual report and accounts.
Directors should plan their assessment of going concern as early as practicable
including deciding on the processes, procedures, information, analyses and board
papers that will be needed. These plans should also address the evidence to be
obtained, including identifying any potential remedial actions that may need to be
addressed, to support their conclusion prior to their approval of the annual or half-
yearly ﬁnancial statements.
The practical effect will usually be that directors of UK companies will adopt 
a review period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of annual and

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
82
half-yearly ﬁnancial statements but, in rare cases, when they do not they should
explain why.
Directors of listed companies incorporated in the UK are required by the Listing
Rules to include in their annual ﬁnancial report a statement that the business is a going
concern, together with supporting assumptions or qualiﬁcations as necessary, that has
been prepared in accordance with the Guidance.
The auditor is required to consider the disclosures about going concern and liquidity
risk made in the ﬁnancial statements. If the auditor concludes that the disclosures 
are not adequate to meet the requirements of accounting standards and CA 2006,
including the need for ﬁnancial statements to give a true and fair view, the auditor is
required to qualify its opinion and to provide its reasons for doing so.
A major inquiry into going concern issues produced its ﬁnal report in 2012 (the
Sharman Report). It recommends greater prominence of discussions of business risk
considered in the going concern evaluation.
4.3.2
Accruals (also called ‘matching’)
Definition
Accrual accounting depicts the effects of transactions and other events and
circumstances on a reporting entity’s economic resources and claims in the periods 
in which those effects occur, even if the resulting cash receipts and payments occur 
in a different period. This is important because information about a reporting entity’s
economic resources and claims and changes in its economic resources and claims
during a period provides a better basis for assessing the entity’s past and future
performance than information solely about cash receipts and payments during that
period.26
Financial statements prepared on the accruals basis are useful for stewardship pur-
poses because they report past transactions and events but are also helpful to users for
forward-looking information because they show obligations to pay cash in the future
and resources that represent cash to be received in the future.
The UK Companies Act explains the accruals concept as a requirement that all
income and charges (i.e. expenses) relating to the ﬁnancial year shall be taken into
account, without regard to the date of receipt or payment.
The word ‘accrue’ means ‘to fall due’ or ‘to come as a natural result’. If, during a
year, a company sells £100m of goods but collects only £80m from customers, it
records sales as £100m in the proﬁt and loss account. The cash yet to be collected from
customers is reported as an asset called ‘debtor’ in the statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet). If, during the year, it uses electricity costing £50m but has only paid
£40m so far, it records the expense of £50m in the proﬁt and loss account. The unpaid
electricity bill is reported as a liability called ‘accruals’ in the statement of ﬁnancial
position (balance sheet).
The idea of matching is also used in applying the idea of accruals. Matching has two
forms, matching losses or gains against time and matching expenses against revenue.
Time matching occurs when a gain or loss is spread over the relevant period of time,
such as receiving interest on a loan or paying rent on a property. Matching of revenues
and expenses occurs when costs such as labour are matched against the revenue
earned from providing goods or services.
4.3.3
Consistency
Consistency is described in the IASB Conceptual Framework as an aspect of compar-
ability (see section 4.2.4). The UK Companies Act requires that accounting policies shall
be applied consistently within the same accounts and from one period to the next.

Chapter 4 Ensuring the quality of financial statements
83
Activity 4.1
4.3.4
Prudence
The Companies Act does not deﬁne prudence but uses the word prudent in relation 
to measurement. It requires that the amount of any item shall be determined on a 
prudent basis, and in particular:
(a) only proﬁts realised at the date of the ﬁnancial year-end shall be included in the
proﬁt and loss account; and
(b) all liabilities and losses which have arisen or are likely to arise in respect of the
ﬁnancial year shall be taken into account, including those which only become
apparent between the date of the ﬁnancial year-end and the date on which it is
signed by the board of directors.
The UK ASB has said that decisions about recognition of income or assets and of
expenses or liabilities require evidence of existence and reliability of measurement.
Stronger evidence and greater reliability of measurement are required for assets and
gains than for liabilities and losses.27
4.3.5
Realisation
There is no clear statement of the conditions that will make a proﬁt realised. It is not
speciﬁcally deﬁned in the IASB system. It is an example of an idea that is so widely
used that it appears to be almost impossible to explain. If you turn to a dictionary you
will ﬁnd ‘realise’ equated to ‘convert into cash’. The accounting standard FRS 1828
conﬁrms that it is the general view that proﬁts shall be treated as realised when 
evidenced in the form of cash or other assets whose cash realisation is reasonably 
certain. However, the standard avoids linking realisation to ‘prudence’, explaining
that a focus on cash does not reﬂect more recent developments in ﬁnancial markets.
Evidence of ‘reasonable certainty’ in such markets does not necessarily require cash. It
is based on conﬁdence in the reliable operation of the market.
Take a piece of paper having two wide columns. Head the left-hand column ‘My thoughts
on measurement in accounting’ and head the right-hand column ‘What the book tells me
about measurement’. Fill in both columns and then exchange your paper with a fellow
student. Discuss with each other any similarities and differences in the left-hand column
and relate these to your personal views and prior experience. Discuss with each other 
any similarities and differences in the right-hand column and evaluate the extent to which
different people see books differently. Finally, discuss with each other the extent to which
reading this section has changed your views on measurement as a subject in accounting.
4.4 Views on prudence
The Companies Act 2006 makes an explicit link between prudence and realisation 
that reﬂects UK accounting practice when the previous Companies Act 1985 was 
written. The IASB’s Conceptual Framework avoids mentioning realisation. From the UK
ASB, the standard FRS 18 acknowledges the meaning of realisation but breaks the link
between realisation and prudence.29 It appears that FRS 18 has not changed the
entrenched conservatism of accounting practice which tends towards understatement
on grounds of caution. Where does that leave the student of accounting who wants to
understand the meaning of prudence?
The most important message for students of accounting (and for many practitioners)
has been expressed as follows:

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
84
Activity 4.2
the exercise of prudence does not allow . . . the deliberate understatement of assets or income,
or the deliberate overstatement of liabilities or expenses, because the ﬁnancial statements
would not be neutral and, therefore, not have the quality of reliability.30
Why are there different views on understatement and overstatement, depending on
the item being reported? Here is your ﬁrst chance to use the accounting equation to
solve a problem:
Assets
minus
Liabilities
equals
Capital contributed/withdrawn plus Proﬁt
Proﬁt
equals
Revenue minus Expenses
Ask yourself what will happen to profit in the accounting equation if the amount of an
asset is increased while the liabilities and the capital contributed remain the same. Then
ask yourself what will happen to profit in the accounting equation if the amount of a
liability is decreased while the assets and the capital contributed remain the same. Next
ask yourself what will happen to profit if revenue is overstated. Finally ask yourself what
will happen to profit if expenses are understated.
Assuming that capital contributed/withdrawn remains constant, overstating assets
will overstate proﬁt. Understating liabilities will overstate proﬁt. Overstating revenue
will overstate proﬁt. Understating expenses will overstate proﬁt.
Examples
A market trader buys £100 of stock on credit, promising to pay the supplier at the end
of the day. The trader sells three-quarters of the stock at a price of £90 and takes the
rest home to keep for next week’s market. At the end of the day the trader has £90 in
cash, one-quarter of the stock which cost £25, and owes £100 to the supplier. How
much proﬁt has the trader made? The answer is that the proﬁt is £15 (£90 received for
the sale of stock less the cost of the items sold, £75, being three-quarters of the stock
purchased). The accounting equation is:
Assets minus Liabilities 
equals
Ownership interest at the start of the 
at the end of the period
period plus Capital contributed/ 
withdrawn plus Revenue of the period 
minus Expenses of the period
stock £25 + cash £90 −
equals
nil + nil + revenue £90 −expenses £75
liability £100
£15
equals
£15
1 Supposing the trader ‘forgets’ part of the liability and thinks it is only £84 owing,
rather than £100. The assets remain at stock £25 + cash £90, which equals £115. 
The liability is now thought to be £84 and therefore the equation becomes:
£25 + £90 −£84
equals
nil + nil + revenue £90 −expenses £75 
+ [?] £16 [?]
£31
equals
£31
For the equation to be satisﬁed there must be a total of £31 on both sides. The total
of £31 is therefore written in. The recorded proﬁt is still only £15, calculated as 

Chapter 4 Ensuring the quality of financial statements
85
revenue £90 minus expenses £75, so there is a ‘hole’ amounting to £16 on the right-
hand side of the equation. The accounting equation has to balance so the extra £16
is written in, surrounded by question marks, on the right-hand side. It is assumed
on the right-hand side that the trader has either forgotten to record revenue of £16
or has recorded too much expense, so that the amount appears to represent an
unexplained proﬁt. Thus understating a liability will overstate proﬁt. That favourable
news might mislead a competitor or investor. It might be bad news when HMRC
demands tax on proﬁt of £31. Also there is the unpaid supplier who may not be
entirely patient when offered £84 rather than £100.
2 Supposing instead that the trader ‘forgets’ there is some unsold inventory left. The 
only recorded asset would be the cash at £90 and there would be a liability of £100.
This gives negative net assets of (£10) and, because the accounting equation has to
balance, suggests that there is a ‘forgotten’ expense of £25 on the right-hand side.
The equation then becomes:
£90 −£100
equals
nil + nil + £90 −£75 −[?] £25 [?]
(£10)
equals
(£10)
This would cause HMRC to ask a lot of questions as to why there was no record 
of stock remaining, because they know that omitting inventory from the record is a 
well-tried means of fraudulently reducing proﬁts and therefore reducing tax bills.
Understating an asset will understate proﬁt.
These two examples have illustrated the meaning of the warning that deliberate
understatement or overstatement is not acceptable. The general message of prudence
is: avoid overstating proﬁt. In down-to-earth terms, don’t raise the readers’ hopes too
high, only to have to tell them later that it was all in the imagination.
4.5 Regulation of financial reporting
Because the external users of accounting information do not have day-to-day access to
the records of the business, they rely on the integrity and judgement of management
to provide suitable information of a high quality. But will the management be honest,
conscientious and careful in providing information? In an ideal world there should be
no problem for investors in a company because, as shareholders, they appoint the
directors and may dismiss them if dissatisﬁed with the service provided. However,
the world is not ideal. Some companies are very large and they have many share-
holders whose identity changes as shares are bought and sold. Over the years it has
been found that regulation is needed, particularly for ﬁnancial reporting by com-
panies. The general regulation of companies in the UK is provided by parliamentary
legislation, through the Companies Act 2006.
However, since 2005 the regulation of ﬁnancial reporting by UK companies has
taken two separate routes depending on the type of company.
The group ﬁnancial statements of listed companies must comply with the IAS
Regulation set by the European Commission. The IAS Regulation takes precedence
over the relevant sections of the Companies Act. The IAS Regulation was issued 
in 2002, requiring listed group ﬁnancial statements from 2005 to apply approved
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (previously called International
Accounting Standards, IAS). The UK government subsequently permitted individual
companies and non-listed groups to choose to apply IFRS. Any companies not taking
up this choice must continue to apply the relevant sections of the Companies Act and

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
86
follow the accounting standards set by the UK Accounting Council (previously called
the Accounting Standards Board (ASB)). Other organisations that are not companies
(such as sole traders, partnership, public sector bodies) have to look to the regulations
that govern their operations to decide which accounting guidance to follow.
So how can we tell which accounting system has been applied in any situation?
Look ﬁrst for the audit report, if there is one. That will include a paragraph starting 
‘In our opinion’. In that paragraph the auditors will specify the accounting system 
on which their opinion is based. If there is no auditors’ report, look for the Note on
Accounting Policies. There will usually be a paragraph stating the accounting system
that has been applied.
4.5.1
The IAS Regulation
In 2002 the European Commission issued the IAS Regulation which took effect from 
1 January 2005. Its purpose is to harmonise the ﬁnancial information presented 
by public listed companies in order to ensure a high degree of transparency and 
comparability of ﬁnancial statements. The Regulation is relatively short but has been
extended and clariﬁed by a trail of subsequent documents. The European Commission
publishes all documents on its website31 in the languages of all member states but that
is more detail than is necessary for a ﬁrst-year course.
A Regulation is directly applicable in member states. It has a higher status than a
Directive, which is an instruction to member states on the content of their national
laws. Before the Regulation was issued, the company law of member states was 
harmonised by following the Fourth and Seventh Directives on company law. Com-
panies in member states did not need to know the Directives because the national
company law applied the Directives. Now that the IAS Regulation is directly applicable,
member states must ensure that they do not seek to apply to a company any additional
elements of national law that are contrary to, conﬂict with or restrict a company’s
compliance with IASs.
The Commission decides on the applicability of IFRS within the Community. It is
assisted by an Accounting Regulatory Committee and is advised by a technical group
called the European Financial Reporting and Accounting Group (EFRAG).32 The tests
for adoption of IFRS are that the standards:
(a) do not contradict speciﬁc principles of the Fourth and Seventh Directive,
(b) are conducive to the European public good, and
(c) meet the criteria of understandability, relevance, reliability and comparability
required of ﬁnancial information needed for making economic decisions and
assessing the stewardship of management.
A standard that is adopted is said to be endorsed. If a standard is awaiting endorse-
ment, or is rejected, it may be used as guidance if it is not inconsistent with endorsed
standards. If a rejected standard is in conﬂict with adopted standards, it may not be
used. When the European Commission ﬁrst announced the endorsement process there
were fears expressed that this would be used to create ‘European IFRS’ by selecting
some IFRS and rejecting others. The Commission’s reply was that the EU cannot give its
powers to a body (the IASB) that is not subject to EU jurisdiction, and it is necessary
for the EU to endorse standards as part of its duty in setting laws for member states.
4.5.2
UK company law
Companies Act 2006
The Companies Act 2006 sets many rules to protect those investing in companies and
to guide those operating companies. Parts of the Act cover the information presented

Chapter 4 Ensuring the quality of financial statements
87
in ﬁnancial statements. For companies and other organisations that do not follow the
IAS Regulation, the Companies Act 2006, by means of Statutory Instruments, pre-
scribes formats of presentation of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)
and proﬁt and loss account. Companies must select one of the permitted formats. 
It also prescribes methods of valuation of the assets and liabilities contained in the
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet), broadly expecting that normally these
items will be recorded at their cost at the date of acquisition, subject to diminutions in
value since that date. Some other approaches to valuation are permitted, but these are 
carefully regulated and are subject to requirements for prudence, consistency and an
expectation that the business is a going concern (i.e. will continue for some time into
the future). The UK legislation places strong emphasis on the requirement to present
a true and fair view in ﬁnancial statements.
Since the early 1980s company law on ﬁnancial reporting has been harmonised with
that of other Member States in the EU through the Fourth and Seventh Directives of
the EU (see Chapter 7).
The directors are responsible for the preparation of company accounts. Exhibit 4.1
(see p. 90) sets out the statement made by directors of one major public company
regarding their responsibilities in these matters. This type of statement will be found
in the annual reports of most of the large listed companies. It is regarded as an import-
ant aspect of giving reassurance to investors and others that there is a strong system
of corporate governance within the company. It is also intended to clarify any mis-
understandings the shareholders may have about the work of directors as distinct
from the work of the auditors (see below).
The Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act, 2004 made
changes intended to improve the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting, the independ-
ence of auditors and disclosure to auditors. In particular it required a statement to 
be inserted in the directors’ report conﬁrming that there is no relevant infor-
mation that has not been disclosed to the auditors. The role of the Financial Reporting
Review Panel was strengthened by giving it new powers to require documents. HM
Revenue and Customs was authorised to pass information about companies to the
FRRP.
4.5.3
The Financial Reporting Council33
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) describes itself as the UK’s independent regu-
lator responsible for promoting high quality corporate governance and reporting to
foster investment. It is recognised in its regulatory role by the UK government’s
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The government effectively delegates
responsibility to an independent body but maintains close interest in the strategy and
operations of the FRC.
There was a major restructuring of the FRC in July 2012. This section describes the
new structure but also refers to the previous structure to explain terms that you may
still encounter.
The FRC carries out a range of roles. Most relevant to this textbook is that it moni-
tors and enforces accounting and auditing standards. It promotes high standards of
corporate governance through the UK Corporate Governance Code. It sets standards
for corporate reporting and actuarial practice. It also oversees the regulatory activities
of the professional accountancy bodies and the actuarial profession and operates inde-
pendent disciplinary arrangements for public interest cases involving accountants and
actuaries.
The FRC is an independent body governed by a Board whose members are drawn
from a wide range of business expertise.
The structure is summarised in Figure 4.1. Aspects of the FRC’s work relevant to
ﬁnancial reporting are then described in this section.

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
88
Accounting role
One role of the FRC is to issue UK accounting standards. UK Accounting standards
apply to all companies, and other entities that prepare accounts that are intended to
provide a true and fair view, unless International Financial Reporting standards apply.
IFRS apply to companies listed on a Stock Exchange.
The FRC took over this standard-setting role in July 2012. Until then it was carried
out by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) as a subsidiary of the FRC. The ASB had
previously taken over the task of setting accounting standards from the Accounting
Standards Committee (ASC) in 1990. Accounting standards formerly developed by the
Accounting Standards Board are contained in ‘Financial Reporting Standards’ (FRSs).
The ASB adopted the standards issued by the ASC, which are designated ‘Statements
of Standard Accounting Practice’ (SSAPs). Whilst some of the SSAPs have been super-
seded by FRSs, some remain in force.
The FRC also collaborates with accounting standard-setters from other countries
and with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In this way the FRC
seeks to inﬂuence the development of international standards and to ensure that its
own standards are developed with due regard to international developments.
Codes and Standards Committee
The Codes and Standards Committee is responsible for advising the FRC Board on
maintaining an effective framework of UK codes and standards for Corporate Govern-
ance, Stewardship, Accounting, Auditing and Assurance, and Actuarial technical
standards. For this textbook the most important functions of this committee relate to
accounting standards and audit and assurance standards.
Accounting Council
As explained above, in July 2012, the Accounting Council replaced the UK’s Accounting
Standards Board, which had been in place since 1990. It does not have the standard-
setting power of the previous ASB but instead takes on more of an advisory role. The
detailed remit uses ‘consult and advise’ or ‘consult and comment’ to describe the
activities of the Accounting Council. It could be argued that the standard-setting 
role of the previous ASB has now largely been taken on by the IASB. Consequently a

Council which provides strategic input and thought leadership, within widespread
consultation and research, is more valuable in maintaining UK inﬂuence on the inter-
national standard setting process.
The Council consists of up to twelve members, at least half of which are practising
members of the relevant profession and the remainder will be other stakeholders.
Members of the Councils are appointed through an open process overseen by the
Chair of the Codes and Standards Committee (CSC) subject to the overall guidance of
the Nominations Committee of the FRC.
Audit and Assurance Council
The Audit and Assurance Council has remit of similar type to that of the Accounting
Council. The words are ‘considers and comments’ or ‘considers and advises’. The
FRC’s Codes and Standards Committee develops and maintains standards and guid-
ance for Audit and Assurance engagements that are performed in the public interest
within the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. It also seeks to inﬂuence the
development of international auditing and assurance standards and policy, issues that
are relevant to its remit.
Conduct Committee
The Conduct Committee operates as a Conduct Division which encompasses the
FRC’s monitoring, oversight, investigative and disciplinary functions. It covers audit
quality review, corporate reporting review, professional discipline and professional
oversight, and supervisory enquiries.
Of particular relevance to this chapter, the work of the Conduct Division includes
direct monitoring of ﬁnancial reports and audits of public interest entities.
Under the Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) the Conduct Committee has been author-
ised and appointed by the Secretary of State for the Department of Business, Innovation
and Skills (BIS) to exercise functions with a view to ensuring that accounts and ﬁnancial
and other reports, including annual reports, and directors’ reports (Reports) of com-
panies and other entities comply with the law and relevant reporting requirements.
The Conduct Committee’s policy is to select Reports for review (a) by methods which
take into account the Conduct Committee’s assessment of the risk of non-compliance
and the consequence of non-compliance, and (b) as a result of complaints.
The Conduct Committee maintains a Financial Reporting Review Panel (FRRP)
comprising individuals who have the appropriate qualiﬁcations and experience to sit
on a Review Group including the Chairman and Deputy Chairman or Chairmen who
are also members of the Conduct Committee and the Monitoring Committee. Review
Groups will be appointed from the FRRP by the Monitoring Committee.
The legal powers and duties described above for the Conduct Committee were,
prior to July 2011, allocated to the FRRP. Consequently this type of monitoring work
has been in place for many years and previous reports will be found under the author-
ship of the Financial Reporting Review Panel.
The Conduct Committee can ask directors to explain apparent departures from the
requirements. If it is not satisﬁed by the directors’ explanations it aims to persuade
them to adopt a more appropriate accounting treatment. The directors may then 
voluntarily withdraw their accounts and replace them with revised accounts that 
correct the matters in error. Depending on the circumstances, the Conduct Committee
may accept another form of remedial action – for example, correction of the compara-
tive ﬁgures in the next set of annual ﬁnancial statements. Failing voluntary correction,
the Conduct Committee can exercise its powers to secure the necessary revision of the
original accounts through a court order. The FRC maintains a legal costs fund of £2m
for this purpose. The Conduct Committee’s predecessor, the FRRP, enjoyed a long and
successful record in resolving all cases brought to its attention without having to apply

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene

for a court order. The Conduct Committee does not offer advice on the application of
accounting standards or on the accounting requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
4.5.4
Corporate governance34
UK listed companies are required by the Stock Exchange to apply the Corporate
Governance Code. Institutional investors are encouraged to recognise their responsi-
bilities by adhering to the Stewardship Code. Both are explained in this section.
Corporate governance code
Corporate governance is a term applied to the way in which a company is managed
by its directors to show a high level of responsibility to shareholders and the wider
capital market. The UK has a tradition of codes of corporate governance dating from
Exhibit 4.1
Statement of directors’ responsibilities as expressed in the annual report of a public limited company
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the
Group and the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law
the Directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the Parent Company financial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company
and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
l select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
l make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
l state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable UK Accounting Standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and Parent
Company financial statements respectively; and
l prepare the Group and Parent Company financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the Company’s and Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages nn and nn, confirms that, to the
best of their knowledge:
l the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
l the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the
position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group website www.xxxname.com.

1992. Initially the codes were written by committees and given the names of the chairs
of the committees. Thus during the 1990s we saw in succession the Cadbury Code, the
Greenbury Code and the Hampel Code (explained further in Chapter 14 section 14.7.1).
These were consolidated as the UK Corporate Governance Code. Responsibility for main-
taining the UK Corporate Governance Code now rests with the Financial Reporting
Council.
The Code sets out good practice covering issues such as board composition and
effectiveness, the role of board committees, risk management, remuneration and 
relations with shareholders. It operates on the principle of ‘comply or explain’. If com-
panies comply with the recommendations of the Code they do not need to describe
compliance at great length. If they do not comply with any speciﬁc aspect, they must
provide an explanation in the annual report.
The main recommendations of the Code include:
l separate Chairman and Chief Executive;
l a balance of executive and independent non-executive directors;
l strong, independent audit and remuneration committees;
l annual evaluation by the board of its performance;
l transparency on appointments and remuneration;
l effective rights for shareholders, who are encouraged to engage with the companies
in which they invest.
Stewardship code
Experience with the Corporate Governance Code, particularly in the period of ﬁnan-
cial crisis around 2007 and 2008, indicated that something more was needed to
enhance the quality of engagement between institutional investors and companies.
The Stewardship Code was introduced to meet this need and to complement the
Corporate Governance Code. It is written with the aim of helping to improve long-
term returns to shareholders and the efﬁcient exercise of governance responsibilities.
The word ‘engagement’ is used to emphasise the idea of all parties meeting and
talking to each other. It expects purposeful dialogue on strategy, performance and the
management of risk, as well as on issues that are the immediate subject of votes at 
general meetings.
Institutional shareholders are free to choose whether or not to engage as recom-
mended by the Code but once the institution has agreed, their employees and agents
are expected to follow the agreed procedures.
The main principles are that institutional investors should:
l publicly disclose their policy on how they will discharge their stewardship 
responsibilities;
l have a robust policy on managing conﬂicts of interest in relation to stewardship and
this policy should be publicly disclosed;
l monitor their investee companies;
l establish clear guidelines on when and how they will escalate their activities as a
method of protecting and enhancing shareholder value;
l be willing to act collectively with other investors where appropriate;
l have a clear policy on voting and disclosure of voting activity;
l report periodically on their stewardship and voting activities.

Stock Exchange regulation
Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the Financial Services Authority
(FSA) was established as a single regulator with responsibility across a wide range of
ﬁnancial market activity. In particular the FSA has, for more than 10 years, regulated
listing of companies’ shares on the UK Stock Exchange. The work has been carried out

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
92
by a division called the UK Listing Authority (UKLA). When a company ﬁrst has its
shares listed, it must produce a prospectus, which is normally much more detailed
than the annual report. The regulations covering the content of a prospectus have been
set by the UKLA. Once a company has achieved a listing, it must keep up with on-
going obligations under the Listing Rules. This ongoing obligation includes providing
accounting information to the market in the annual report and making press releases.
Details of the Listing Rules are not necessary for ﬁrst-level study but you should be
aware that these have an inﬂuence on the content of a company’s annual report. There
are also Disclosure and Transparency rules which affect the content and timing of
annual reports published by companies.
Following the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 and 2008 it became apparent that the loss of
conﬁdence in ﬁnancial markets and ﬁnancial systems required a new form of regu-
lation in the UK. From 2013 the FSA splits into a Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)
and a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The Listing Rules become part of the remit
of the FCA. The FCA regulates compliance of issuers (listed companies) and major
shareholders with the disclosures required under the Disclosure and Transparency
and Listing Rules.
There are three kinds of listing on the UK Stock Exchange: Premium (previously
called Primary); Standard (previously called Secondary); and AIM (The Alternative
Investment Market). Different levels of regulation and disclosure apply to each. A
Premium Listing means the company is expected to meet the UK’s highest standards
of regulation and corporate governance – and as a consequence may enjoy a lower cost
of capital through greater transparency and through building investor conﬁdence.
Issuers with a Premium Listing are required to meet the UK’s ‘super-equivalent’ rules
which are higher than the EU minimum requirement. Such companies are eligible for
inclusion in the FTSE indices. A Standard Listing is more commonly used by overseas
companies, as it allows issuers to access the main market by meeting EU harmonised
standards only rather than the UK ‘super-equivalent’ requirements. AIM companies
are usually newer and smaller companies making their initial entry to market trading
for their shares. AIM listed companies are regulated but not as strongly as the
Premium listed companies. Consequently the annual reports of AIM listed companies
are less detailed.
4.5.6
Auditors
The shareholders of companies do not have a right of access to the records of the day-
to-day running of the business, and so they need someone to act on their behalf to
ensure that the directors are presenting a true and fair view of the company’s position
at a point in time and of the proﬁts generated during a period of time. To achieve 
this reassurance, the shareholders appoint a ﬁrm of auditors to investigate the com-
pany’s ﬁnancial records and give an opinion on the truth and fairness of the ﬁnancial
information presented. Exhibit 4.2 sets out the wording of a typical audit report to the
Exhibit 4.2
Sample audit report
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of XYZ plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of XYZ plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which
comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Balance
Sheet, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, Reconciliation of net
cash flow to movement in net debt and the related notes to the Group financial statements. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

Exhibit 4.2 continued
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities (set out on page nn), the Directors are
responsible for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a
body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person 
to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
l give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its profit and
cash flows for the year then ended;
l have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
l have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
l certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
l we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
l the Directors’ statement (set out on page 90), in relation to going concern;
l the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
l certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of XYZ plc for the year ended 
31 December 2011 and on the information in the Remuneration Report that is described as having been
audited.

shareholders of a public company. You will see that there are separate opinions on the
ﬁnancial statements and on other aspects of the accounting information recorded or
provided by the company.
You will note that the auditors do not look at all the pages of the annual report. The
earlier part of the annual report is important to the companies in setting the scene and
explaining their businesses. These earlier pages are reviewed by the auditors to ensure
that anything said there is consistent with the information presented in the audited
ﬁnancial statements. You will also note that the auditors have their own code of prac-
tice, referred to as International Standards for Auditing (ISAs). The ISAs are prepared
by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) which oper-
ates under a body called the International Financial Accounting Committee (IFAC).
The standards are then adopted by national standard-setters. In the UK the national
standard-setter is the Financial Reporting Council.
What surprises some readers is the phrase ‘reasonable assurance that the accounts
are free from material misstatement’. The auditors are not expected to be totally cer-
tain in their opinion and they are only looking for errors or fraud which is material.
The meaning of the word ‘material’ has proved difﬁcult to deﬁne and it tends to be a
matter left to the judgement of the auditor. The best guidance available is that an item
is material if its misstatement or omission would cause the reader of the annual report
(shareholder or creditor) to take a different decision or view based on the ﬁnancial
statements.
4.5.7
The tax system
Businesses pay tax to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) (as the tax-collecting agent
of the government) based on the proﬁts they make. Sole traders and partnerships 
pay income tax on their proﬁts while companies pay corporation tax. There are 
differences in detail of the law governing these two types of taxes but broadly they
both require as a starting point a calculation of proﬁt using commercial accounting
practices. The law governing taxation is quite separate from the law and regu-
lations governing ﬁnancial reporting, so in principle the preparation of ﬁnancial 
statements is not affected by tax matters. That is very different from some other 
countries in the EU where the tax law stipulates that an item must be in the ﬁnan-
cial accounting statements if it is to be considered for tax purposes. Those countries
have an approach to ﬁnancial reporting which is more closely driven by taxation 
matters.
In the UK the distinction may be blurred in practice in the case of sole traders
because HMRC is the main user of the ﬁnancial statements of the sole trader. Similarly,
tax factors may inﬂuence partnership accounts, although here the fairness of sharing
among the partners is also important. The very smallest companies, where the owners
also run the business, may in practice have the same attitude to tax matters as does the
sole trader or partnership. For larger companies with a wider spread of ownership, the
needs of shareholders will take priority.
4.5.8
Is regulation necessary?
There are those who would argue that all this regulatory mechanism is unnecessary.
They take the view that in a market-based economy, competitive forces will ensure that
those providing information will meet the needs of users. It is argued that investors
will not entrust their funds to a business which provides inadequate information.
Banks will not lend money unless they are provided with sufﬁcient information 
to answer their questions about the likelihood of receiving interest and eventual
repayment of the loan. Employee morale may be lowered if a business appears 

Activity 4.3

95
non-communicative regarding its present position and past record of performance.
Suppliers may not wish to give credit to a business which appears secretive or has 
a reputation for producing poor-quality information. Customers may be similarly
doubtful.
Against that quite attractive argument for the abolition of all regulations stand
some well-documented ﬁnancial scandals where businesses have failed. Employees
have lost their jobs, with little prospect of ﬁnding comparable employment elsewhere;
suppliers have not been paid and have found themselves in ﬁnancial difﬁculties as 
a result. Customers have lost a source of supply and have been unable to meet the
requirements of their own customers until a new source is found. Those who have
provided long-term ﬁnance for the business, as lenders and investors, have lost their
investment. Investigation shows that the signs and warnings had existed for those
who were sufﬁciently experienced to see them, but these signs and warnings did not
emerge in the published accounting information for external use.
Such ﬁnancial scandals may be few in number but the large-scale examples cause
widespread misery and lead to calls for action. Governments experience pressure from
the electorate and lobby groups; professional bodies and business interest groups
decide they ought to be seen to react; and new regulations are developed which ensure
that the particular problem cannot recur. All parties are then reasonably satisﬁed that
they have done their best to protect those who need protection against the imbalance
of business life, and the new practices are used until the next scandal occurs and the
process starts over again.
There is no clear answer to the question ‘Is regulation necessary?’ Researchers have
not found any strong evidence that the forces of supply and demand in the market 
fail to work and have suggested that the need for regulation must be justiﬁed by show-
ing that the beneﬁts exceed the costs. That is quite a difﬁcult challenge but is worth
keeping in mind as you explore some of the more intricate aspects of accounting 
regulation.
Look back through this section and, for each subheading, make a note of whether you
were previously aware that such regulation existed. In each case, irrespective of your
previous state of knowledge, do you now feel a greater or a lesser sense of confidence 
in accounting information? How strong is your confidence in published accounting
information? If not 100%, what further reassurance would you require?
4.6 Reviewing published financial statements
If you look at the annual report of any large listed company you will ﬁnd that it has
two main sections. The ﬁrst part contains a variety of diagrams and photographs, 
a statement by the chairman, a report by the chief executive and, in many cases, a
Business Review or an Operating and Financial Review which may extend to a con-
siderable number of pages. Other aspects of the business, such as its corporate govern-
ance and environmental policy, may also be explained. This ﬁrst part is a mixture of
unregulated and broadly regulated material. There are many sources of inﬂuence on
its contents, some of which will be explained in later chapters of this book.
The second part contains the ﬁnancial statements, which are heavily regulated. As
if to emphasise this change of status, the second part of the annual report will often
have a different appearance, perhaps being printed on a different colour or grade 
of paper, or possibly having a smaller print size. Appendix I to this book contains

Part 1 A conceptual framework: setting the scene
96
extracts from the ﬁnancial statements of a ﬁctitious company, Safe and Sure plc, which
will be used for illustration in this and subsequent chapters.
Relaxing after a hard workout at the health club, David Wilson took the oppor-
tunity to buy Leona a drink and tell her something about Safe and Sure prior to a visit
to the company’s headquarters to meet the ﬁnance director.
DAVID: This is a major listed company, registered in the UK but operating around the 
world selling its services in disposal and recycling, cleaning and security. Its name is 
well known and its services command high prices because of the company’s repu-
tation gained over many years. Basically it is a very simple business to understand. It sells
services by making contracts with customers and collects cash when the service is 
performed.
In preparation for my visit I looked first at the performance of the period. This com-
pany promises to deliver growth of at least 20% in revenue and in profit before tax so 
first of all I checked that the promise had been delivered. Sure enough, at the front of 
the annual report under ‘Highlights of the year’ there was a table showing revenue had
increased by 22.4% and profit before tax had increased by 20.4%. I knew I would 
need to look through the profit and loss account in more detail to find out how the
increases had come about, but first of all I read the operating review (written by the chief
executive) and the financial review (written by the finance director). The chief executive
gave more details on which areas had the greatest increase in revenue and operating 
profit and which areas had been disappointing. That all helps me in making my forecast of
profit for next year.
The chief executive made reference to acquisitions during the year, so I knew I would
also need to think whether the increase in revenue and profits was due to an improvement
in sales and marketing as compared with last year or whether it reflected the inclusion of
new business for the first time.
In the financial review, the finance director explained that the business tries to use as 
little working capital as possible (that means they try to keep down the current assets and
match them as far as possible with current liabilities). I guessed I would need to look at the
statement of financial position to confirm that, so I headed next for the financial statements
at the back of the annual report, pausing to glance at the auditors’ report to make sure
there was nothing highlighted by them as being amiss.
The financial statements are quite detailed and I wanted a broad picture so I noted down
the main items from each in a summary format which leaves out some of the detail but
which I find quite useful.

DAVID: It is part of my job to make forecasts of what the next reported profit of the 
company is likely to be (i.e. the profit of Year 8). This is March Year 8 now so there are
plenty of current signs I can pick up, but I also want to think about how far Year 7 will be
repeated or improve during Year 8. A few years ago I would have made a rough guess and
then phoned the finance director for some guidance on whether I was in the right area.
That’s no longer allowed because the Financial Services Authority tightened up the rules
on companies giving information to some investors which is not available to others, 
especially where that information could affect the share price.
One easy way out is for me to collect the reports which come in from our stockbrokers.
Their analysts have specialist knowledge of the industry and can sometimes work out what
is happening in a business faster than some of the management. However, I like to form
my own opinion using other sources, such as trade journals, and I read the annual report
to give me the background structure for my forecast. The company has helpfully separ-
ated out the effect of continuing and discontinued operations, which helps me in making
a forecast.
When I meet the finance director next week I’ll have with me a spreadsheet analysing
revenue and profit before tax – so far as I can find the data – by product line and for each
of the countries in which the company trades. I’ll also ask the following questions:
1 Although the revenue has increased, the ratio of gross profit to revenue on continuing
operations has increased only very slightly, from 31.1% in Year 6 to 31.3% in Year 7.
That suggests that the company has increased revenue by holding price rises at a level
matching the increase in operating costs. I would like to see the company pushing
ahead with price rises but does the company expect to see a fall in demand when its
prices eventually rise?
2 The tax charge on continuing operations has decreased from approximately 33% to
31.5%, slightly higher than the rate which would be expected of UK companies. I know
that this company is trading overseas. You say in your financial review that the tax
charge is 30% in the UK and rates on overseas profits will reduce, so am I safe in 
assuming that 30% is a good working guide for the future in respect of this company?
3 With all this overseas business there must be an element of foreign exchange risk. 
You say in your financial review that all material foreign currency transactions are
matched back into the currency of the group company undertaking the transaction. 
You don’t hedge the translation of overseas profits back into sterling. You also say that
using Year 6 exchange rates the Year 7 profit, including the effect of the discontinued
operations, would have been £180.5m rather than the £177.0m reported. That seems 
a fairly minimal effect but are these amounts hiding any swings in major currencies
where large downward movements are offset by correspondingly large upward 
movements?
4 Your increase in revenue, comparing £714.6m to £589.9m, is 21.1% which is meeting
the 20% target you set yourself. However, elsewhere in the financial statements I see
that the acquisitions in Year 7 contributed £13.5m to revenue. If I strip that amount out
of the total revenue I’m left with an increase in respect of activities continuing from Year
6 which is only 19%. When the scope for acquisitions is exhausted, will you be able to
sustain the 20% target by organic growth alone?
4.6.2
Statement of financial position (balance sheet)
DAVID: Looking at the statement of financial position, this is a fairly simple type of busi-
ness. It is financed almost entirely by equity capital (shareholders’ funds), so there are 
none of the risks associated with high levels of borrowings which might be found in other
companies.
Again, I have summarised and left out some of the details which aren’t significant in
financial terms.

DAVID: By far the largest non-current (fixed) asset is the intangible asset of goodwill arising
on acquisition. It reflects the fact that the group has had to pay a price for the future
prospects of companies it has acquired. Although the company reports this in the group’s
statement of financial position, and I like to see whether the asset is holding its value from
the group’s point of view, I have some reservations about the quality of the asset because
I know it would vanish overnight if the group found itself in difficulties.
The other non-current assets are mainly equipment for carrying out the cleaning oper-
ations and vehicles in which to transport the equipment. I’ve checked in the notes to the
accounts that vehicles are being depreciated over four to five years and plant and equip-
ment over five to ten years, all of which sounds about right. Also, they haven’t changed 
the depreciation period, or the method of calculation, since last year so the amounts 
are comparable. Estimated useful lives for depreciation are something I watch closely.
There is a great temptation for companies which have underperformed to cut back on the
depreciation by deciding the useful life has extended. (Depreciation is explained more 
fully in Chapter 8.)
I think I might ask a few questions about working capital (the current assets minus the
current liabilities of the business). Normally I like to see current assets somewhat greater
than current liabilities – a ratio of 1.5 to 1 could be about right – as a cushion to ensure the
liabilities are met as they fall due. However, in this company the finance director makes a
point of saying that they like to utilise as little working capital as possible, so I’m wonder-
ing why it increased from £29.4m in Year 6 to more than £80m in Year 7. There appear to
be two effects working together: current assets went up and current liabilities went down.
Amounts receivable (trade debtors) increased in Year 7 in absolute terms but that isn’t as
bad as it looks when allowance is made for the increase in revenue. Amounts receivable in

Chapter 4 Ensuring the quality of financial statements
99
Year 7 are 20.6% of continuing revenue, which shows some control has been achieved
when it is compared with the Year 6 amount at 22.8% of revenue. My questions will be:
1 Mostly, the increase in the working capital (net current assets) appears to be due to the
decrease in bank borrowing. Was this a voluntary action by the company or did the bank
insist?
2 The second major cause of the increase in the working capital is the increase in the 
balance held in the bank account. Is that being held for a planned purpose and, if so,
what?
3 The ratio of current assets to current liabilities has increased from last year. What target
ratio are you aiming for?
I always shudder when I see ‘provisions’ in a statement of financial position. The notes to
the financial statements show that these are broadly:
£m
For treating a contaminated site
12.0
For restructuring part of the business
4.2
For tax payable some way into the future
4.0
Total
20.2
I shall want to ask whether the estimated liability in relation to the contaminated site is 
adequate in the light of any changes in legislation. I know the auditors will have asked 
this question in relation to existing legislation but I want to think also about forthcoming
legislation.
I am always wary of provisions for restructuring. I shall be asking more about why the
restructuring is necessary and when it will take place. I want to know that the provision is
sufficient to cover the problem, but not excessive.
The provision for tax payable some way into the future is an aspect of prudence in
accounting. I don’t pay much attention unless the amount is very large or suddenly changes
dramatically. (An explanation of deferred taxation is contained in Chapter 10.)
4.6.3
Statement of cash flows
DAVID: Cash is an important factor for any business. It is only one of the resources avail-
able but it is the key to survival. I’ve summarised the totals of the various main sections of
the cash flow statement. ‘Net cash’ means the cash less the bank borrowings.

What I’m basically looking for in the cash flow statement is how well the company is 
balancing various sources of finance. It generated £143m from operating activities and 
that was more than sufficient to cover its investing activities in new fixed assets and 
acquisitions. There was also enough to cover the dividend of £29.5m, which is a financing
activity but that was partly covered by raising new loan finance. This is why the cash used
in financing activities is only £10.2m. I come back to my earlier question of why they are
holding so much cash.

Read David’s explanation again and compare it carefully with the financial statements. It is
quite likely that you will not understand everything immediately because the purpose of
this book as a whole is to help you understand published financial statements and we are,
as yet, only at the end of Chapter 4. Make a note of the items you don’t fully understand
and keep that note safe in a file. As you progress through the rest of the book, look back
to that note and tick off the points which subsequently become clear. The aim is to have
a page full of ticks by the end of the book.
4.7 Summary
The IASB’s stated objective of general purpose ﬁnancial reporting is to provide ﬁnan-
cial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential
investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources
to the entity. Those decisions involve buying, selling or holding equity and debt
instruments, and providing or settling loans and other forms of credit.
The two fundamental qualitative characteristics are:
l relevance
l faithful representation.
Each of these has further contributing characteristics. Relevance consists of either pre-
dictive value or conﬁrmatory value, or both. Faithful representation consists of 
neutrality, freedom from error, and completeness. There are four further enhancing
qualitative characteristics. These are:
l comparability
l veriﬁability
l timeliness
l understandability.
The accounting measurement principles that are most widely known in the UK are
found within the Companies Act 2006:
l going concern
l accruals
l consistency
l prudence.
Regulation of ﬁnancial reporting in the UK comes from several sources:
l The IAS Regulation requires all listed groups of companies to prepare ﬁnancial
statements using the system of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB
system). Other companies may choose to follow the IASB system.
l Companies that do not follow the IASB system must comply with UK company
law.
l The Financial Reporting Council regulates accounting and auditing matters under
the authority of UK company law. It sets UK accounting standards and auditing
standards. It also takes action against companies whose annual reports do not 
comply with the relevant accounting system (IASB or UK company law).
l There are Stock Exchange Listing Rules which inﬂuence annual reports of listed
companies.
l The UK tax system charges corporation tax on company proﬁts. Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs (HMRC) starts with the accounting proﬁt in calculating 
the amount of tax payable but there are some special rules of accounting for tax 
purposes.

1 Director: ‘We do not need to tell shareholders about a loss of £2,000 on damaged stock
when our operating profit for the year is £60m.’
2 Shareholder: ‘I would prefer the statement of financial position (balance sheet) to tell me the
current market value of land is £20m than to tell me that the historical cost is £5m, although
I know that market values fluctuate.’
3 Analyst: ‘If the company changes its stock valuation from average cost to FIFO, I want to
hear a good reason and I want to know what last year’s profit would have been on the same
basis.’
4 Regulator: ‘If the company reports that it has paid “commission on overseas sales”, I don’t
expect to discover later that it really meant bribes to local officials.’
5 Director: ‘We have made a profit on our drinks sales but a loss on food sales. In the Notes
to the Accounts on segmental results I suggest we combine them as “food and drink”. It will
mean the annual report is less detailed for our shareholders but it will keep competitors in
the dark for a while.’

use to discuss the accounting aspects of each of the problems 1–5 and explain your ideas.

l accruals

1 Director: ‘The fixed assets of the business are reported at depreciated historical cost because
we expect the company to continue in existence for the foreseeable future. The market value
is much higher but that is not relevant because we don’t intend to sell them.’
2 Auditor: ‘We are insisting that the company raises the provision for doubtful debts from 2%
to 2.5% of debtor amount. There has been recession among the customer base and the
financial statements should reflect that.’
3 Analyst: ‘I have great problems in tracking the depreciation policy of this company. It owns
several airports. Over the past three years the expected useful life of runways has risen from
30 years to 50 years and now it is 100 years. I find it hard to believe that the technology of
tarmacadam has improved so much in three years.’
4 Auditor: ‘We have serious doubts about the ability of this company to renew its bank over-
draft at next month’s review meeting with the bank. The company ought to put shareholders
on warning about the implications for the financial statements.’
5 Shareholder: ‘I don’t understand why the company gives a profit and loss account and a
cash flow statement in the annual report. Is there any difference between profit and cash
flow?’
Activities for study groups
Continuing to use the annual reports of a company that you obtained for Chapter 1, look for 
the evidence in each report of the existence of the directors, the auditors and the various 
regulatory bodies.
In your group, draw up a list of the evidence presented by companies to show that the annual
report has been the subject of regulation. Discuss whether the annual report gives sufficient
reassurance of its relevance and faithful representation to the non-expert reader.

REAL WORLD CASE
Croda International plc is a global leader in speciality chemicals,
sold to a wide range of markets – from personal care to health
care; from crop care to coatings and polymers. In its annual
report it describes its investment in employees:
Employees
1. Recruitment & retention
Like all successful businesses, we recognise that our future depends 
on our ability to attract and retain individuals who are passionate
about personal and business growth and want to make a significant
contribution to the future of our business. Recruiting individuals that 
fit this description and the culture of the business is always hard, but
within the chemical industry it is increasingly a problem with a high
level of competition for a decreasing number of graduates. As our
business is focused on innovation and growth in emerging markets
and developing countries, this challenge increases further.
2. Compensation & benefits
In a competitive recruitment marketplace we are conscious that we
should not lose critical staff because of issues relating to pay or additional benefits. We realise that the
remuneration package we offer plays a key part in attracting and retaining employees.
3. HR policies & systems
Information and knowledge sharing are at the heart of making better business decisions. Streamlined systems and
policies not only provide the data and trends on which to base decisions, but will in turn drive employee engagement.
We believe that well defined policies and procedures allow our employees to operate without constant
management intervention. It is this autonomy and freedom to act that has made our business what it is today.
4. Talent management and employee development
The key to the future success of any business lies in the skills and abilities of its workforce. It is only through the
continual development of our workforce that we will be able to meet the future demands of our customers in
relation to enhanced creativity, innovation and customer service. Being a business dependent upon a large
number of specialists including engineers and scientists as well as finance, IT, HR, marketing, purchasing, sales,
regulatory and legal professionals we have to place great focus on continuous development.
5. Performance management
A strong, efficient performance management culture is not only important to employees’ professional development,
but also to meet the Company’s objectives and so ultimately contributing to its bottom line. In addition, a clear,
robust process will lead to enhanced communications and an opportunity to address performance problems
effectively, thus delivering improvements in employee morale.

The ‘people’ asset does not appear in the balance sheet of a company. What are the costs to the company of
maintaining the ‘people’ asset?
2
What are the risks to a service business of strong reliance on a ‘people’ asset?

organisation.
5.1 Introduction
A person who starts a service business intends to offer a service based on personal
skills for which other people will be willing to pay a fee. The most important asset of
the service business is the person or people providing the service. Despite that, the
workforce as an asset never appears in an accounting statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet). That is because, although it satisﬁes all the conditions of the deﬁnition,
it is too difﬁcult to measure objectively and so does not meet the conditions for recog-
nition. (See Chapter 2 for the deﬁnition of an asset and the conditions for recognition
of an asset.)
The service business will have other assets which accounting is able to record: for
example, the taxi driver may own a taxi; the electrician will have electrical tools; the
joiner will have a workbench and joinery tools; the car mechanic will have a repair
garage and equipment; the lawyer will have an ofﬁce and a word-processor. The 

Part 2 Reporting the transactions of a business
108
Activity 5.1
service business will also buy materials for use in any particular job and the customer will
be asked to pay for these materials as well as for the labour time involved. Moreover,
it will have liabilities to suppliers of goods and services used by the business itself.
There will be an owner or owners having an ownership interest in the business. The
service business will make proﬁts for the owner (and thus increase the ownership
interest) by charging a price for services which is greater than the cost of labour and
materials used in providing the service.
All these aspects of the service business may be analysed and recorded on the 
basis of the accounting equation as speciﬁed in Chapter 2. This chapter will discuss the
analysis of transactions using the accounting equation and will then apply that analysis
to the transactions of a doctor providing a service of medical health screening for 
managerial and secretarial staff.
Choose a service business and write down the main activity of that business. Then write
down the types of expense you would expect to find in the income statement (profit and
loss account) of such a business. Write down the types of asset you would expect to find
in the statement of financial position (balance sheet). Exchange your list with a fellow
student. What are the similarities and what are the differences? Keep your list safe and
when you have finished the chapter compare your list with the example in the chapter.
Ask yourself, at that point, whether you would be able to apply what you have learned 
to the business you have chosen.
5.2 Analysing transactions using the accounting equation
Three main categories of accounting elements in the accounting equation have been
deﬁned in Chapter 2: asset, liability and ownership interest. Any one of these elements
may increase or decrease during a period of time but the ownership interest may con-
veniently be subdivided. There will be increases and decreases caused by the decision
of the owner(s) to make further contributions of capital or to withdraw capital. There
will be increases and decreases due to the activity of the business, with revenues
increasing the ownership claim and expenses decreasing it.
Decrease in ownership interest
Increase in ownership interest
Withdrawals of capital by the owner
Contributions of capital by the owner
Expenses
Revenues
Consequently there are several aspects to consider when transactions are analysed
according to the accounting equation.
The accounting equation will be used in this chapter in the form:
Assets
minus
Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
When one item in the equation increases, an upward arrow will be used and when
one item decreases a downward arrow will be used:
denotes a decrease in an asset.
denotes an increase in a liability.
Liabilities ↑
Assets ↓

Chapter 5 Accounting information for service businesses
109
For further emphasis, bold highlighting will be used for the elements of the 
equation which are changed as a result of the transaction or event.
Each business transaction has two aspects in terms of the accounting equation.
These aspects must be considered from the viewpoint of the business. Table 5.1 sets out
a list of some common types of transaction encountered in a service business. Each
transaction is then analysed using the accounting equation.
Table 5.1
List of transactions for a service business
Transaction

Receive cash from the owner.
2
Buy a vehicle for cash.
3
Receive a bill for gas consumed.
4
Pay the gas bill in cash.
5

6
Buy materials on credit terms.
7
Sell services for cash.
8
Sell services on credit terms.
9
Pay wages to an employee.
10
Pay cash to the owner for personal use.
Transaction 1: receive cash from the owner
In this transaction the business acquires an asset (cash) and must note the ownership
interest created by this contribution of capital from the owner:
Assets ↑−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↑
The equation remains in balance because an increase to the left-hand side is exactly
matched by an increase to the right-hand side.
Transaction 2: buy a vehicle for cash
In this transaction the business acquires a new asset (the vehicle) but gives up another
asset (cash):
Assets ↑↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
Transaction 3: receive a bill for gas consumed
The business becomes aware that it has a liability to pay for gas consumed and also
knows that the ownership interest has been reduced by the expense of using up gas in
earning revenue for the business:
Assets −Liabilities ↑
equals
Ownership interest ↓(expense)
Transaction 4: pay the gas bill in cash
The asset of cash is reduced and the liability to the gas supplier is reduced:
Assets ↓−Liabilities ↓
equals
Ownership interest

Part 2 Reporting the transactions of a business
110
Transaction 5: buy materials for cash
When the materials are acquired they will create an asset of inventory (stock), for
future use. The asset of inventory (stock) will therefore increase and the asset of cash
will decrease:
Assets ↓↑−Liabilities
Equals
Ownership interest
Transaction 6: buy materials on credit terms
Again, materials are acquired which cause an increase in the asset of inventory (stock).
Obtaining goods on credit means that there is a liability created for amounts owing to
the supplier:
Assets ↑−Liabilities ↑
equals
Ownership interest
Transaction 7: sell services for cash
The cash received from the customer causes an increase in the asset of cash, while the
act of selling services increases the ownership interest through earning revenue:
Assets ↑−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↑(revenue)
Transaction 8: sell services on credit terms
The sale of services creates an increase in the ownership interest through earning 
revenue, but also creates an increase in the asset of trade receivables (debtors):
Assets ↑−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↑(revenue)
Transaction 9: pay wages to an employee
The asset of cash decreases when the wage is paid and there is a decrease in the 
ownership interest because the business has used up the service provided by the
employee (an expense has been incurred):
Assets ↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓(expense)
This is a transaction which often causes problems to those new to accounting. They
would like to argue that paying wages creates an asset, rather than an expense, because
there is an expected future beneﬁt to be gained from the services of the employee. The
answer to that argument is that, while there is no disputing the expected future beneﬁt
from the services of most employees, the wages paid are for work already done and so
there can be no future expectations about that particular week’s or month’s work. The
question of whether the workforce as a whole should be recognised as an asset of the
business is one of the unresolved problems of accounting.
Transaction 10: pay cash to the owner for personal use
The asset of cash decreases and the ownership interest decreases because the owner has
made a voluntary withdrawal of capital:
Assets ↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓(voluntary withdrawal)

Activity 5.2
Write down the transactions of Table 5.1 in a different order and put the piece of paper
away for two days. Then take it out and practise the analysis of each transaction without
looking at the answers in the book. If your answers are all correct, is it the result of
memory or of genuine understanding? If your answers are not entirely correct, can you
decide where the problem lies? It is very important that you can analyse transactions
correctly using the accounting equation. It is also important that you use your powers of
reasoning and not your powers of memory. You cannot possibly memorise the accounting
treatment of every transaction you will meet.
5.3 Illustration of accounting for a service business
We now move on to an example which considers the private medical practice of 
Dr Lee. At the start of October Dr Lee commenced a new medical practice offering a
general health screening service to managerial and secretarial staff at a standard fee of
£500 per examination. Where patients make personal arrangements they will be asked
to pay cash on the day of the examination. If the patient’s employer has agreed to pay
for the screening, Dr Lee will send an invoice to the employer, requiring payment
within 30 days.
In Table 5.2 there is a list of transactions for Dr Lee’s medical practice during 
the month of October. Try to work out the effect on the accounting equation of each
transaction listed. Do this before you read the rest of this section. Then compare your
answers and your reasoning with that in the rest of this section. Being able to reason
correctly at this stage will reduce the likelihood of error later.
Oct. 1
When Dr Lee provides the practice with cash in a bank account to allow the
business to start, the business acquires an asset of cash at bank and the trans-
action creates an ownership interest by Dr Lee in the assets of the business.
This means that the business now has the use of £50,000, but, if the business
ceases immediately, that £50,000 must be returned to Dr Lee. The accounting
equation is satisﬁed because an increase in an asset is matched by an increase
in the ownership interest:
Assets ↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓
Oct. 2
The medical practice now becomes the business entity so far as accounting 
is concerned (although it is fairly clear that Dr Lee is making all the decisions
as the manager of the business as well as being the owner). The entity 
acquires an asset of medical equipment in exchange for an equal decrease in
the amount of an asset of cash. The accounting equation is satisﬁed because
the increase in one asset is exactly equal to the decrease in another.
Assets ↑↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
Oct. 2
The medical practice pays one month’s rent in advance. At the moment of
paying the rent, an asset is acquired representing the beneﬁt to be gained
from the use of the consulting rooms for the month ahead. However, this
beneﬁt only lasts for a short time and will have expired at the end of the
accounting period (which has been chosen as one month for the purpose 
of this example). Once the beneﬁt of an asset has expired, the business

Part 2 Reporting the transactions of a business
112
becomes worse off and the ownership interest decreases. That decrease is
called an expense of the business. To save the time and trouble of recording
such transactions as assets and then re-naming them as expenses at the end
of the accounting period, the short-cut is taken of calling them expenses from
the outset. There needs to be a check on such items at the end of the account-
ing period to ensure that there is no part of the beneﬁt remaining which
could still be an asset.

In terms of the accounting equation there is a decrease in the ownership
interest due to an expense of the business. There is a corresponding decrease
in the asset of cash.
Assets ↑−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓(expense)
Oct. 2
The entity acquires an asset of ofﬁce furniture. It does not pay cash on this
occasion, having been given two months to pay. Looking over the rest of the
transactions for October it is clear that there has been no payment by the end
of the month. At the moment of taking delivery of the asset, the business
incurs a liability to the supplier, Ofﬁce Supplies Company. The accounting
equation is satisﬁed because the increase in an asset is exactly equal to the
increase in a liability.
Assets ↑−Liabilities ↑
equals
Ownership interest
Oct. 7
The practice purchases medical supplies on credit from P. Jones and receives
an invoice. This is very similar to the previous transaction. An asset is
acquired and a liability to a supplier is created. The liability is recognised when
the practice accepts delivery of the goods because that is the moment of
accepting legal liability. For convenience, accounting procedures normally
use the arrival of the invoice as the occasion for recording the liability but,
even if the invoice failed to arrive, the liability must be recognised in relation
to accepting the goods.

Ownership interest

The medical receptionist has worked for one week and is paid for the work
done. The amount paid in wages is an expense of the business which
decreases the ownership interest because the beneﬁt of that work has been
used up in providing support for the medical practice. There is a decrease in
the asset of cash.
Assets ↓ −Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓(expense)
Oct. 10
The medical practice now begins to carry out the activities which increase the
wealth of the owner by earning revenue. The patients pay cash, so there is an
increase in the asset of cash, and the owner becomes better off so there is an
increase in the ownership interest.
Assets ↑−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↑(revenue)
Oct. 11
The business pays P. Jones in cash for the goods it acquired on credit.
Payment of cash decreases the asset of cash and decreases the liability to the
supplier. Because the supplier is paid in full, the liability is extinguished.

The business pays an electricity bill in full. The business has enjoyed the use
of the electricity but there is no beneﬁt remaining. This is an expense of the
business which causes a decrease in the ownership interest. There is a decrease
in the asset of cash.
Assets ↓−Liabilities

Ownership interest ↓(expense)

The payment to the medical receptionist is similar in effect to the payment
made on 8 October, causing a further expense which decreases the ownership
interest and causes a decrease in the asset of cash.

Ownership interest ↓(expense)
Oct. 17
There is an increase in the ownership interest which arises from the oper-
ations of the business and so is termed revenue. On this occasion the business
acquires an asset of a trade receivable (debtor), showing that an amount of
money is owed by the employer of these patients.

The cash received from the employer of the three patients examined on 
17 October causes an increase in the asset of cash and a decrease in the asset
of the trade receivable (debtor). Because the amount is paid in full, the asset
of the trade receivable (debtor) is reduced to nil.
Assets ↑↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest

Again the business carries out the activities intended to make the owner 
better off. The accounting effect is similar to that of 17 October, with an increase
in the ownership interest and an increase in the asset of cash.

Ownership interest ↑(revenue)
Oct. 28
The owner of a sole trader business does not take a salary or wage as an
employee would, but nevertheless needs cash for personal purposes. Taking
cash for personal use is called taking ‘drawings’ and is recorded in terms of
the accounting equation as a decrease in the ownership interest and a decrease
in the asset of cash.
Assets ↓−Liabilities

Ownership interest ↓(drawings)

Paying wages causes an expense and a decrease in the asset of cash.

The medical equipment and the ofﬁce furniture are non-current (ﬁxed) assets
of the business. They are expected to have some years’ useful life in the 
business but they will eventually be used up. In accounting, the term ‘depre-
ciation’ is applied to this gradual using up and there are various ways of
deciding how much of the ﬁxed asset has been ‘used up’ in any period.
(Chapter 8 gives more information on depreciation.) For this example the
owner’s estimate of depreciation is sufﬁcient. There is a decrease in the non-
current (ﬁxed) assets which is not matched by an increase in any other asset
and so there is a decrease in the ownership interest due to the operations of
the business. Depreciation is an expense of the business.
Assets ↓−Liabilities

Ownership interest ↓(expense)
Oct. 31
Dr Lee checks the inventory (stock) of medical supplies and ﬁnds that items
costing £350 have been used during the month. When these medical supplies
were received on 7 October, they were all treated as an asset of the business.
It appears now that the asset has been reduced from £1,200 to £850 and that
the items used up have caused a decrease of £350 in the ownership interest.
This decrease is the expense of medical supplies which will appear in the
income statement (proﬁt and loss account) of the month. The two aspects of
this event are therefore a decrease in the ownership interest and a decrease in
the asset of inventory (stock) of medical supplies.
Assets ↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓(expense)
This analysis has been set out in some detail to show that each transaction must ﬁrst
of all be considered, in order to establish the nature of the two aspects of the trans-
action, before any attempt is made to deal with the monetary amounts. The next section
uses the analysis based on the accounting equation to produce a spreadsheet which
can be totalled to give a summary picture of the transactions of the month in terms of
the accounting equation.
5.4 A process for summarising the transactions: 
a spreadsheet
In Table 5.3 the transactions are repeated in the left-hand column but the relevant
money amounts are shown in columns which correspond to the assets, liabilities and
ownership interest, using brackets to show a negative amount. (It would be equally
acceptable to use a minus sign but minus signs tend to disappear or be confused with
unintentional blobs on the paper, so brackets are frequently used in accounting in
order to ensure clarity.)
Taking the ﬁrst line as an example, the analysis of the transaction showed that 
there was an increase in the asset of cash and an increase in the ownership interest.
Thus the amount of £50,000 is written in the spreadsheet column for cash and again 
in the spreadsheet column for ownership interest. In the second line, the asset of 
cash decreases by £30,000 and the asset of medical equipment increases by £30,000. 
A similar pattern follows down the spreadsheet for each transaction.
It may be seen that where there are more than a few transactions during the month,
a spreadsheet of the type shown in Table 5.3 would need to be much larger and use
more columns.

At the foot of the spreadsheet in Table 5.3 there is a total for each column. Those
totals from Table 5.3 are used in Table 5.4, which represents the accounting equation, to
show the state of the accounting equation at the end of the month. It may be used to
explain to Dr Lee how the ownership interest has changed over the month. The owner
contributed £50,000 at the start of the month and has a claim of £50,700 at the end of
the month. The ownership interest was increased by earning revenue of £5,500 but
reduced by incurring expenses of £3,800 and withdrawing £1,000 for personal use.
5.5 Financial statements as a means of communication
This chapter has established the approach taken in accounting towards analysing and
classifying transactions in such a way that Dr Lee as the owner of a business knows how
much better or worse off she has become during a period. There is sufﬁcient infor-
mation contained in Table 5.3 and it is possible to write an interpretation based on
Table 5.4. However, this presentation is not particularly informative or easy on the eye.
The process of communication requires some attention to a clear style of presentation.
Accounting practice has evolved the statement of cash ﬂows, the income statement
(proﬁt and loss account) and the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) to give
the owner a more informative presentation of the information contained in Tables 5.3
and 5.4.
Chapter 3 set out the structure of the ﬁnancial statements of a business. These ideas
are now applied to Dr Lee’s medical practice. Don’t worry too much about how the
information is transferred from Table 5.3 to these ﬁnancial statements, but look back to
the table and satisfy yourself that you can ﬁnd the corresponding pieces of information.

Comment. All the amounts for this statement are taken from the ‘Cash at bank’ column
of Table 5.3 but are regrouped for the three headings of operating activities, investing
activities and ﬁnancing activities. The statement shows that the business had a net
outﬂow of cash of £900 due to operations and an outﬂow of cash amounting to £30,000
due to purchase of medical equipment. The owner contributed £50,000 at the start of
the month but took drawings of £1,000 at the end, resulting in a net inﬂow of £49,000
from ﬁnancing. The overall effect was an increase in cash over the period amounting
to £18,100.

Comment. The total fees charged constitute the total revenue of the period as may be
seen in the column in Table 5.3 headed ‘revenue’. The expenses of the period amount
to £3,800 and are taken from the ﬁnal column of Table 5.3. The difference between 
revenue and expenses is the proﬁt of £1,700. This is the amount by which the owner-
ship interest has increased to make the owner of the business better off.
Some students ask at this point why the owner’s drawings are not included in the
income statement (proﬁt and loss account). The answer is that making drawings of
cash has nothing to do with the operations of the business. It is a voluntary action
taken by the owner, who is also the manager, balancing the owner’s personal need for
cash against the needs of the business for cash to ensure continued smooth running.
Where the owner is the only person working in the business, the owner may regard
the drawings as being closer to wages. The amount taken may represent wages in 
economic terms. However, accounting ignores this economic reality and reports all
amounts withdrawn by the owner as drawings.
The medical practice of Dr Lee has made a profit of £1,700 over the month but the cash
flow caused by operations is an outflow of £900. How can a business make a profit and
yet see an outflow of cash caused by operations? This question is asked all too often in
reality. You can provide the answer by comparing the cash flow due to operating activities
and the calculation of net profit. If you are not sure how to make the comparison, look
back to Chapter 3 where the financial statements of P. Mason’s legal practice were
analysed (Table 3.7).

Comment. The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) follows the pattern of 
the accounting equation. The non-current (ﬁxed assets) are presented ﬁrst of all, showing
the resources available to the business over a longer period of time. The depreciation
is deducted to leave an amount remaining which is probably best described as the
‘depreciated cost’ but is often labelled ‘net book value’ or ‘written down value’.
Chapter 8 contains more information on the procedures for measuring and recording
depreciation and the limitations of using the word ‘value’ in relation to those procedures.
The next section contains the current assets which are expected to be converted
into cash within a 12-month period. The medical supplies shown are those which have
not yet been used and therefore remain as a beneﬁt for the next month. Trade receiv-
ables (debtors) are those customers who are expected to pay in the near future. The
other current asset is the cash held at the bank, which is very accessible in the short term.
The only liability is the amount of £6,500 owing to the Ofﬁce Supplies Company,
due for payment at the start of December. This is a current liability because it is due
for payment within 12 months.
It is felt to be helpful in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) to set out
subtotals which may guide the reader. These have been shaded in the statement of
ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). The total of non-current (ﬁxed) assets is interesting as
the long-term asset base used to generate proﬁts. The difference between the current
assets and the current liabilities is sometimes identiﬁed separately as the working
capital. At the moment the current assets look rather high in relation to the need to
cover current liabilities. This is because the amount of cash held is quite high in rela-
tion to the apparent needs of the business. It is possible that Dr Lee has plans to use
the cash for business purposes quite soon but, in the absence of such plans, Dr Lee
ought to consider investing it to earn interest or else withdrawing it for other uses.
The amount for total assets less total liabilities (A – L) is usually called the net
assets of the business. (The word ‘net’ means ‘after taking something away’ – in this
case, after taking away the liabilities.) There is not much to say here except to note that

QUESTIONS
The Questions section of each chapter has three types of question. ‘Test your understanding’
questions to help you review your reading are in the ‘A’ series of questions. You will find the
answers to these by reading and thinking about the material in the book. ‘Application’ questions
to test your ability to apply technical skills are in the ‘B’ series of questions. Questions requiring
you to show skills in problem solving and evaluation are in the ‘C’ series of questions. A letter
[S] indicates that there is a solution at the end of the book.

it equals the ownership interest as would be expected from the accounting equation.
The ownership interest has increased over the period through making a proﬁt of
£1,700 but decreased by £1,000 through making drawings, so that the resulting
increase is £700 overall.
Compare the financial statements of Dr Lee’s medical practice with the information
collected in the spreadsheet of Table 5.3. Take a pencil and, very lightly, place a tick
against each amount in the financial statements and a tick against each amount in the
spreadsheet, as you match them together. If you are able to work backwards in this way
from the financial statements to the spreadsheet then you will be well on the way to
understanding how the financial statements are related to the original list of transactions.
5.6 Summary
The ﬁrst stage in recording a transaction is to think about its effect on the accounting
equation.
Assets minus Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
A transaction must have at least two effects on the accounting equation. For example,
when cash is contributed by the owner there is an increase in the asset of cash and an
increase in the ownership interest:
Assets ↑−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↑
Accounting transactions may be recorded in a spreadsheet where the columns
record the assets and liabilities and the rows record each transaction. The totals at 
the foot of all columns contain the information for the statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet) at the end of the period. The columns for revenue and expenditure
allow the proﬁt or loss to be calculated. The bank or cash column provides infor-
mation for the statement of cash ﬂows.

Supplement to Chapter 5
Recording transactions in ledger accounts –

In the supplement to Chapter 2 it was shown that the rules for debit and credit bookkeeping may
be summarised in terms of the elements of the accounting equation as shown in Table 5.5.

In the supplement to Chapter 3 a spreadsheet was used to show that a series of
transactions could be analysed and summarised in tabular form. That spreadsheet 
format is becoming increasingly used as the basis for computer-based recording of
transactions but the more conventional approach to analysing transactions is to collect
them together in ledger accounts. This supplement takes the transactions of Chapter 5
and analyses them in debit and credit form in order to produce a trial balance as a
basis for the preparation of ﬁnancial statements.
In Table 5.1 some common transactions of a service business were listed and then
analysed using the accounting equation. They will now be analysed in terms of where
the debit and credit entries would be made in a ledger account. Test yourself by trying
out the answer before you look at the answer in Table 5.6 below. Once you are satisﬁed
that you could produce the correct answer for the transactions in Table 5.1, you are
ready to deal with Dr Lee’s medical practice.
Illustration: Dr Lee’s medical practice
The ﬁrst transaction in Table 5.2 reads:
Oct. 1
Dr Lee provides the practice with cash, £50,000.
The two aspects of this transaction were identiﬁed as:
1 Acquisition of an asset (cash).
2 Increasing the ownership interest (voluntary contribution).
The bookkeeping system requires two ledger accounts in which to record this trans-
action. One ledger account is called Cash and the other is called Ownership interest.

Chapter 5 Accounting information for service businesses
123
There will be a debit entry of £50,000 in the Cash ledger account showing that the busi-
ness has acquired an asset of £50,000 cash. There will be a credit entry of £50,000 in the
Ownership interest ledger account showing that the business acknowledges the claim
of the owner for eventual return of the amount contributed.
The second transaction in Table 5.2 reads:
Oct. 2
The entity acquires medical equipment for cash, £30,000.
The two aspects of this transaction were identiﬁed as:
1 Acquisition of an asset (medical equipment).
2 Decrease of an asset (cash).

The bookkeeping system requires two ledger accounts in which to record this
transaction. One ledger account is called Medical equipment and the other is called
Cash.
There will be a debit entry of £30,000 in the Medical equipment ledger account
showing that the business has acquired an asset of £30,000 medical equipment.
There will be a credit entry of £30,000 in the Cash ledger account showing that 
the business has reduced its asset of cash by £30,000 to pay for the medical 
equipment.
Analysing the debit and credit entries for each transaction
Table 5.7 takes the information contained in Table 5.2 and analyses it under debit and
credit headings showing the ledger accounts in which each entry will be made.
Ledger accounts required to record these transactions are:
L1 Cash
L8
Inventory (stock) of medical supplies
L2 Ownership interest
L9

L3 Medical equipment and office furniture
L10 Electricity
L4 Office Supplies Company

Form of ledger accounts
There is no single standard form of ledger account rulings in which to record debit and
credit transactions. Historically, ledger accounts were recorded in what were called ‘T’
accounts where all the debit entries were on the left-hand side and all the credit entries
on the right-hand side. This was designed to minimise arithmetic errors by avoiding
subtractions in systems which were dealt with manually.

This type of layout requires a wide page if it is to be read clearly. In recent years
ledger accounts have more frequently been prepared in a ‘three-column’ ruling which
keeps a running total. This book will use the three-column ruling throughout. You will
see by comparison of the column headings that the different types of rulings use the
same information. If you have an opportunity to look at business ledgers you will
probably come across yet more varieties, but they will all require the inclusion of this
basic set of information.

Features are:
l The left-hand column will show the date of the transaction.
l The ‘particulars’ column will show essential narrative, usually conﬁned to the name
of the ledger account which records the other aspect of the transaction.
l The ‘page’ column will show the ledger account page number of the ledger account
where the other aspect of the transaction is recorded.
l The amount of the transaction will be entered in the debit or credit column as
appropriate.
l The ‘balance’ column will keep a running total by treating all debit entries as positive
and all credit entries as negative. A credit balance will be shown in brackets as a
reminder that it is negative. Some ledger systems print the letters ‘dr’ or ‘cr’ against
the balance.
Illustration
The ﬁrst transaction of Table 5.7 may now be shown in the appropriate ledger accounts.
It will require a debit entry in a cash account to indicate an increase in the asset of cash
and a credit entry in the ownership interest account to indicate an increase in the 
owner’s claim.

LEONA’s comment: The amount of £50,000 put into the business at the start is quickly
eaten into by spending cash on medical equipment and paying rent in advance. Further
items such as paying a supplier, paying the electricity account and the assistant’s wages
took the cash balance down further but it remained quite high throughout the month. With
the benefit of hindsight the owner might not have needed to put so much cash into the
business at the outset. Up to £18,000 could have been invested on a short-term basis to
earn interest, either for the business or for Dr Lee.

LEONA’s comment: The ownership interest is created when the owner contributes cash or
resources to the business. In this case it was cash. The sole trader in business may withdraw
cash for personal use at any time – it is called owner’s drawings – but the desirability of
that action depends on how useful cash is to the owner when compared to how useful it
might have been if left in the business. The owner of this business has a claim remaining
equal to £49,000 after making the drawing.

LEONA’s comment: This ledger account is particularly useful as a reminder that some 
very valuable assets are owned by the business. Having a record in the ledger account
encourages the owner to think about continuing care for the medical equipment and office
furniture and also to review their value against the amount recorded. If Dr Lee intended to
have a large number of fixed asset items it is possible to have a separate ledger account
for each, but that seems a long-distant prospect at the moment.
Depreciation is a way of showing that the original cost of the asset has to be spread over
its useful life. If the estimate of depreciation is correct, this ledger account should reduce
to nil on the day the equipment and furniture ceases to be of use. In reality, things usually
are not quite so straightforward. (Depreciation of non-current (fixed) assets is dealt with in
more detail in Chapter 8.)

LEONA’s comment: When the office furniture was purchased from the Office Supplies

LEONA’s comment: This payment in advance starts by being an asset and gradually turns
into an expense as the benefit is used up. For bookkeeping purposes, a debit entry records
both an asset and an expense so it is only at the end of the month that some care is needed
in thinking about the nature of the debit balance. In this case it is clear that the benefit is
used up but there could be a situation where part of the benefit remained to be reported
as an asset.

LEONA’s comment: This is a straightforward account in which to accumulate all wages

days of the month and add these on, but there is a very useful idea in accounting called
‘materiality’ which, broadly interpreted, means the extra information provided would not
justify the extra amount of work involved.

a professional service is being described.

LEONA’s comment: This is an asset account so when the medical supplies were acquired
on credit from P. Jones the entire amount was recorded as an asset. These medical sup-
plies will be quite small items and it would not be appropriate for Dr Lee to have to count
every cotton wool swab, hypodermic needle or sample bottle used in each examination. It
is sufficient for accounting purposes to count up what is left at the end of the period (we
call it ‘taking stock’) and assume that the difference represents the amount used during the
period. As an auditor, I might start to ask questions about possible errors, fraud or theft if
the amounts of supplies used did not look sensible when compared with the number of
examinations carried out on patients.

LEONA’s comment: This is another expense account showing an item which has decreased
the ownership interest through a decrease in the recorded amount of some assets. This is
where accounting begins to look slightly complicated because no cash has changed hands.
Recording depreciation is the accounting way of expressing caution as to the expected
future benefits from an asset. These will be eroded as the asset is used up. Depreciation
is a way of acknowledging that erosion.

LEONA’s comment: This account continues the story from L8 where the inventory (stock)
of medical supplies was found to have dwindled through use in examining patients. It is
assumed that the difference between the amount purchased and the amount held at the
end of the month represents the expense of using the asset during the month.
Checking the accuracy of double-entry records
At periodic intervals it may be considered necessary for a number of reasons to check
the accuracy of the entries made in ledger accounts. For instance, the omission of an
entry on the debit side of a customer’s ledger account for goods sold on credit terms
could result in a failure to issue reminders for payment of an amount owed to the 
business.
There are methods in double-entry bookkeeping of discovering these and other
errors. One such method is the use of the trial balance.
If a debit entry and a credit entry have been made in the appropriate ledger
accounts for each business transaction, then the total money amount of all the debit
entries will equal the total money amount of all the credit entries. If a debit entry has
been made without a corresponding credit entry (or vice versa), then the totals will 
not agree.
In the ledger accounts shown in this example, the balances have been kept as 
running totals. It would be possible to add up all the debit and all the credit entries 
in each ledger account but the same arithmetic proof will be obtained by listing all 
the debit balances and all the credit balances. It was explained earlier in this supple-
ment that brackets are used in the ledger accounts to show credit balances. The list 
of balances on all the ledger accounts for Dr Lee’s medical practice is set out in 
Table 5.8.
Error detection using the trial balance
The calculation of the totals of each column of the trial balance is a useful precaution
which will reveal some, but not all, of the errors it is possible to make in a debit and
credit recording system. Think ﬁrst about the errors you might make and then check
against the following list:

Part 2 Reporting the transactions of a business
132
Errors which will be detected by unequal totals in the trial balance
l Omitting one aspect of a transaction (e.g. a debit entry but no credit entry).
l Writing incorrect amounts in one entry (e.g. debit £290 but credit £209).
l Writing both entries in one column (e.g. two debits, no credit).
l Incorrect calculation of ledger account balance.
Errors which will leave the trial balance totals equal
l Total omission of a transaction.
l Errors in both debit and credit entry of the same magnitude.
l Entering the correct amount in the wrong ledger account (e.g. debit for wages
entered as debit for heat and light).
Preparing the financial statements
The main part of this chapter set out the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)
and income statement (proﬁt and loss account) of Dr Lee’s medical practice for the
month of October. If you compare the amounts in the trial balance with the amounts
in the ﬁnancial statements you will see they are the same. The normal practice in
accounting is to use the trial balance to prepare the statement of ﬁnancial position 
(balance sheet) and income statement (proﬁt and loss account).
In this case it would be a little easier to use the trial balance for this purpose if it
were arranged so that all the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) items are

together and all the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) items are together. This
is done in Table 5.9.
This form of trial balance will be used in later chapters as the starting point for the
preparation of ﬁnancial statements.
By way of providing further help in preparing the income statement (proﬁt and loss
account) and statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet), subtotals are calculated
for each part of the trial balance in Table 5.9. The difference between the subtotals in
each section gives the proﬁt amount. That is because the exhibit has been subdivided
according to two equations, each of which leads to proﬁt:

REAL WORLD CASE
Sales and profit performance for the Group
Gross transaction value for the Group for the 53 weeks to 
3 September 2011 of £2,679.3 million increased by 4.5% over
the previous year. For the 52 weeks to 27 August 2011, Group
gross transaction value grew by 2.9%. The primary drivers of
gross transaction growth were the multi-channel business,
Magasin du Nord, international sales and new UK space.
Revenue for the 53 week period was £2,209.8 million, 4.2%
higher than last year. On a 52 week basis, revenue increased
by 2.7%.
Like-for-like sales including VAT increased by 1.2% over the 
52 week period. Excluding VAT, like-for-like sales for this
period were slightly lower, down 0.3%. This was a good
result given the difficult economic environment and the
disruption to sales arising out of the adverse winter weather
across the UK in November and December which alone
adversely impacted like-for-like sales for the year by some 1%.
Group gross margin fell slightly by 20 basis points during the
year. This was partly a result of a decision to maximise cash profit by driving sales during the second
half of the year and partly some oneoff benefits in last year’s figure as a result of the acquisition of the
Faith footwear brand.
Gross profit before exceptional items for the year increased from £290.4 million to £296.7 million, an
increase of 2.2% for the year.
Headline profit before tax for the year, which adds back amortisation of capitalised bank fees and
exceptionals, for the 53 week year increased by 10.0% year-on-year from £151.0 million to £166.1 million.
Reported profit before tax and exceptionals rose by 10.3% to £160.3 million from £145.3 million for
the same period last year.
Basic earnings per share for 2011 were 9.1 pence (2010: 7.5 pence) and diluted earnings per share
were also 9.1 pence (2010: 7.5 pence).

Chapter 6 Accounting information for trading businesses
137
6.1 Introduction
Chapter 5 has shown in detail the application of the accounting equation to the 
analysis of transactions in service businesses. The same approach applies in the case
of trading businesses, but with one signiﬁcant addition. Businesses which engage in
trading have either purchased or manufactured a product with the intention of selling
that product to customers. It is the purchase or manufacture of a product and the act
of selling the product which must be analysed carefully in terms of the accounting
equation. This chapter ﬁrst analyses the transactions and events occurring when goods
are purchased for resale and sold to a customer. Secondly, it analyses the transactions
and events occurring when goods are manufactured and then sold to a customer.
Finally, there is a worked example which takes one month’s transactions of a trading
business and shows the resulting ﬁnancial statements.
6.2 Goods purchased for resale
A trading business which buys goods for resale (e.g. a wholesaler buying goods from
a manufacturer for distribution to retailers) makes a proﬁt by selling the goods at a
price which is higher than the price paid. The difference between the selling price and
the purchase price is called the gross profit of the business. The gross proﬁt must be
sufﬁcient to cover all the costs of running the business (e.g. administration, marketing
and distribution costs) and leave a net proﬁt which will increase the ownership interest
in the business.
6.2.1
Analysis of transactions
Consider the transactions of a trading company set out in Table 6.1, relating to buying
and selling goods.
Table 6.1
Transactions of a trading company
£
Apr. 1
Purchase goods from manufacturer, 100 items at £2 each, paying 
200
in cash, and store in warehouse.
Apr. 4
Remove 70 items from warehouse to meet a customer’s request. 
140
Those 70 items cost £2 each on 1 April. They are delivered to the 
customer, who accepts the delivery.
Apr. 4
The customer pays in cash. Selling price is £2.50 per item.
175
What is the proﬁt on the sale of 70 items? Each one cost £2.00 and is sold for 
£2.50, so there is a proﬁt of 50 pence per item or £35 for 70 items. In accounting, that
calculation might be set out as follows:
£
Sale of goods (70 items)
175
Cost of goods sold (70 items)
(140)
Gross profit
35
There is an asset of unsold goods (30 items) which cost £2 each or £60 in total. Since
that item is an asset, it will appear in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet).

Part 2 Reporting the transactions of a business
138
That is a statement of the gross proﬁt and of the monetary amount of the asset of
unsold goods, using common sense and intuition to arrive at an answer. Now look at
how a systematic analysis is undertaken in accounting.
6.2.2
Analysis of transactions and events
Apr. 1
Purchase goods from manufacturer, 100 items at £2 each, paying 
£200
in cash, and store in warehouse
This transaction has two aspects in terms of the accounting equation. It increases 
the asset of inventory (stock of goods) and it decreases the asset of cash. One asset
increases, another decreases by an equal amount and there is no effect on the owner-
ship interest.
Assets ↑↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
Apr. 4
Remove 70 items from warehouse to meet customer’s request. 
£140
Those 70 items cost £2 each on 1 April. They are delivered to the 
customer, who accepts the delivery.
This is an event which is not a transaction. The goods which are in the store are
removed to a more convenient place for sale to the customer. In this case they are
removed to a delivery van and transported to the customer. The moment of delivery
to, and acceptance by, the customer is the event which transforms the goods from an
asset to an expense. By that event, ownership is transferred to the customer, who
either pays cash immediately or agrees to pay in the future. The expense is called cost
of goods sold.
It should be noted at this point that the acts of physical removal and transport are
events which ﬁnancial accounting does not record, because at that point there is not
sufﬁcient evidence for recognition that a sale has taken place. In management account-
ing you will ﬁnd that quite a different attitude is taken to events which involve moving
goods from one location to another. In management accounting, such movements are
recorded in order to help the managerial process of control.
In terms of the accounting equation there is a decrease in the asset of inventory
(stock) because it is no longer owned by the business and there can be no future beneﬁt
from the item. The beneﬁt has occurred on this day, creating a sale by the act of delivery
and acceptance.
If an asset has decreased then the ownership interest must also have decreased
through an expense. The expense is called cost of goods sold.
Assets ↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓
(expense: cost of goods sold)
Apr. 4
The customer pays in cash. Selling price is £2.50 per item.
£175
The ﬁnal transaction is the payment of cash by the customer. In timing, it will occur
almost simultaneously with the delivery and acceptance of the goods. In accounting it
is nevertheless analysed separately. The business receives an increase in the asset of
cash and the ownership interest is increased by an act which has earned revenue for the
business.
Assets ↑−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↑(revenue)

Return to Table 6.1 and change the cost price to £3 and the selling price to £3.50.
Calculate the profit if the customer receives (a) 70 items, (b) 80 items, (c) 90 items and 
(d) 100 items. How many items remain in inventory (stock) in each of these four cases?
What can you say about the pattern of profit which appears from the four calculations 
you have carried out? Now write down the effect on the accounting equation for each of
these four separate situations. Doing this will help you to test your own understanding
before you proceed further.
6.2.3
Spreadsheet summarising the transactions
It is possible to bring the analysis together in a spreadsheet similar to that used in
Chapter 5, but containing column headings which are appropriate to the assets
involved in these transactions. Table 6.2 shows the spreadsheet. Table 6.3 summarises
the impact of the accounting equation, showing that the assets remaining at the end 
of the period, £35 in total, equal the sum of the opening capital at the start (nil in this
case) plus revenue, £175, minus expenses, £140.

6.3 Manufacturing goods for resale
The manufacture of goods for resale requires the purchase of raw materials which 
are used in production of the ﬁnished goods. There are several stages here where the
business may hold an asset of one type or another. Any unused raw materials will 

Part 2 Reporting the transactions of a business
140
represent a beneﬁt for the future and therefore be treated as an asset. Any ﬁnished
goods which are not sold will also represent a beneﬁt for the future and therefore be
treated as an asset. Less obvious than these two items is the expected future beneﬁt of
partly completed goods that may be in the production process at the accounting date.
That is also regarded as an asset, called work in progress. If the manufacturing pro-
cess is rapid, then at any date there will be relatively little work in progress. If the
manufacturing process is slow, there could be signiﬁcant amounts of work in progress
at an accounting date.
6.3.1
Analysis of transactions
Consider the transactions of a manufacturing company which are set out in Table 6.4.
The company buys breakfast trays and customises them to designs requested by catering
outlets.
Table 6.4
Transactions of a manufacturing company
£
July 1
Purchase raw materials from supplier, 100 trays at £2 each, 
200
paying in cash, and place in raw materials store.
July 3
Remove 80 trays from raw materials store to meet production 
160
department’s request (cost £2 each).
July 4
Carry out labour work and use production facilities to convert raw 
120
materials into finished goods. Additional costs incurred for labour 
and use of facilities were £1.50 per tray processed.
July 5
Finished goods are transferred to finished goods store. The job 
280
has cost £3.50 per tray in total (80 trays × £3.50 = £280).
July 10
60 trays, which cost £3.50 each to manufacture, are delivered to 
210
a customer.
July 10
The customer pays a price of £5 cash per tray immediately on
300
delivery.
What is the proﬁt on the sale of 60 trays? Each one cost £3.50 to manufacture and is
sold for £5.00 so there is a proﬁt of £1.50 per item or £90 for 60 items.
The business retains an inventory (stock) of 20 unsold ﬁnished trays which cost
£3.50 each to manufacture (a cost of £70 in total) and an inventory (stock) of unused
raw materials (20 basic trays costing £2 each which is a total cost of £40).
That is a statement of the position using common sense and intuition to arrive at an
answer. Now look at how a systematic analysis is undertaken in accounting.
6.3.2
Analysis of transactions and events
July 1
Purchase raw materials from supplier, 100 trays at £2 each, paying
£200
in cash, and place in raw materials store.
The business experiences an increase in the asset of inventory (stock) of raw ma-
terials and a decrease in the asset of cash. In terms of the accounting equation there is
an increase in one asset matched by a decrease in another and there is no effect on the
ownership interest.

July 3
Remove 80 trays from raw materials store to meet production 
£160
department’s request (cost £2 each).
Next, some of the raw materials are removed for use in production. This is an event,
rather than a transaction, but is recorded because it creates a possible asset of work 
in progress. The asset of work in progress increases and the asset of raw materials
decreases. There is no effect on the ownership claim.
Assets ↑↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
July 4
Carry out labour work and use production facilities to convert raw 
£120
materials into finished goods. Additional costs incurred for labour 
and use of facilities were £1.50 per tray processed.
The next stage is that some work is done to convert the raw materials into the prod-
uct desired by customers. The work involves labour cost and other costs of using the
production facilities. (You will ﬁnd in management accounting that the other costs of
using production facilities are usually described as production overheads.) This pay-
ment for labour and use of production facilities is adding to the value of the basic tray
and so is adding to the value of the asset of work in progress (which will eventually
become the asset of ﬁnished goods). So there is an increase in the asset of work in
progress and a decrease in the asset of cash. There is no effect on the ownership interest.
Assets ↑↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
July 5
Finished goods are transferred to finished goods store. The job 
£280
has cost £3.50 per tray in total (80 trays × £3.50 = £280).
When the work in progress is complete, it becomes ﬁnished goods and is trans-
ferred to the store. The asset of work in progress decreases and the asset of ﬁnished
goods increases. A measure of the value of the asset is the cost of making it which, in
this case, is £3.50 per item or £280 for 80 items. Again, there is no effect on the owner-
ship interest.
Assets ↑↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
July 10
60 trays, which cost £3.50 each to manufacture, are delivered to 
£210
a customer.
The customer now requests 60 trays and these are delivered from the store to the
customer. At the moment of acceptance by the customer, the 60 trays cease to be an
asset of the business. There is a decrease in an asset and a decrease in the ownership
interest which is recorded as an expense of cost of goods sold.
Assets ↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓
(expense: cost of goods sold)

The owner’s disappointment is momentary because the act of acceptance by the
customer results in immediate payment being received from the customer (or in some
cases a promise of future payment).
July 10
The customer pays a price of £5 cash per tray immediately on 
£300
delivery.
When the customer pays immediately for the goods, there is an increase in the
asset of cash and a corresponding increase in the ownership interest, recorded 
as revenue of the business.
Assets ↑−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↑(revenue)
Return to Table 6.4. Without looking to the rest of the section, write down the effect of
each transaction on the accounting equation. At what point in the sequence of events in
Table 6.4 is the ownership interest affected? Why is it not affected before that point in the
sequence? How would the ownership interest have been affected if, on 5 July, there had
been a fire as the goods were being transferred to the finished goods store and 
one-quarter of the finished trays were destroyed?
6.3.3
Spreadsheet summarising the transactions
Table 6.5 brings the analysis together in a spreadsheet similar to that used in Table 6.2,
showing the effect of each transaction separately and also the overall effect on the
accounting equation. Table 6.6 sets out the accounting equation at the end of the period
and shows that the assets remaining at the end of the period are equal to the owner-
ship interest at the start (which is taken as nil in this example) plus the proﬁt of the
period.
Once you have understood the analysis up to this point, you are ready to embark
on the ﬁnancial statements of a trading business.
6.4 Illustration of accounting for a trading business
This example considers the business of M. Carter, wholesale trader. At the start of
May, M. Carter commenced a trading business as a wholesaler, buying goods from
manufacturers and storing them in a warehouse from which customers could be 
supplied. All the customers are small shopkeepers who need the services of the whole-
saler because they are not sufﬁciently powerful in purchasing power to negotiate
terms directly with the manufacturers.
In Table 6.7 there is a list of transactions for M. Carter’s wholesaling business during
the month of May. In section 6.4.1 each transaction is analysed using the accounting
equation.
Before reading section 6.4.1, analyse each transaction in Table 6.7 using the accounting
equation. (If necessary look back to Chapter 5 for a similar pattern of analysis.) Then
compare your answer against the detail of section 6.4.1. If there is any item where you
have a different answer, consult your lecturer, tutor or other expert before proceeding
with the rest of the chapter.

6.4.1
Explanation of the analysis of each transaction
May 1
When M. Carter provides the business with cash in a bank account to 
allow the company to proceed, the business acquires an asset of cash and the
transaction creates an ownership interest for M. Carter on the assets of the
business. Using the symbols of the accounting equation:
Assets ↑−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↑
(contribution of capital)
May 2
The wholesale business now becomes the business entity so far as account-
ing is concerned (although M. Carter may still be making the decisions as an
owner/manager of the business). The entity acquires an asset of buildings in
exchange for an asset of cash. There is an increase in one asset and a decrease
in another asset. There is no impact on the ownership interest.
Assets ↑↓−Liabilities

May 7
The entity again acquires an asset of inventory (stock) of goods but this time
it is related to the acquisition of a liability to R. Busby. There is an increase in
the asset of inventory (stock) and an increase in the liability of receivables
(creditors). There is no impact on the ownership interest.
Assets ↑−Liabilities ↑
equals

May 11
When payment is made to R. Busby there is a decrease in the asset of cash
and a decrease in the liability to R. Busby.

When the electricity bill is paid, the beneﬁt of using the electricity has been
consumed. There is a decrease in the asset of cash and a decrease in the
ownership interest, reported as an expense.
Assets ↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓(expense)
May 17
At the moment of acceptance by the customer, the goods cease to be an asset
of the business. There is a decrease in the ownership interest (recorded as an
expense of cost of goods sold) and a decrease in the asset of inventory (stock).
Assets ↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓
(cost of goods sold)
May 17
The owner’s wealth is then immediately restored or enhanced because some
customers pay cash for the goods. There is an increase in the asset of cash
and a corresponding increase in the ownership interest, recorded as revenue
of the business. The information about cost of goods sold has been dealt with
in the previous equation.
Assets ↑−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↑(revenue)
May 17
The owner’s wealth is similarly restored by a promise from the customer to
pay at a future date. This creates the asset of a trade receivable (debtor)
which, in accounting, is regarded as acceptable in the overall measure of
shareholder wealth. There is an increase in the asset of trade receivable
(debtor) and a corresponding increase in the ownership interest, recorded as

dealt with in the earlier equation.

May 24
R. Welsby is a credit customer of the business, called a ‘trade receivable’ or
a ‘debtor’. When a credit customer makes payment to the business there is
an increase in the asset of cash and a decrease in the asset of trade receivable
(debtor). There is no effect on the ownership interest.
Assets ↑↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
May 28
As was explained in Chapter 5, the owner of a sole trader business does not
take a salary or wage as an employee would, but needs cash for personal
purposes. Taking cash for personal use is called drawings and is recorded in
terms of the accounting equation as a decrease in the ownership interest and
a decrease in the asset of cash.
Assets ↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓
(withdrawal of capital)
May 30
Paying wages is similar in effect to paying the electricity bill. The beneﬁt of
the employee’s work has been consumed. There is a decrease in the asset of
cash and a decrease in the ownership interest, reported as an expense.
Assets ↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓(expense)
May 31
All ﬁxed assets will eventually be used up by the business, after several
years of useful life. Depreciation is a recognition of the decrease in the asset
and the decrease in the ownership interest, reported as an expense. (There is
more on depreciation in Chapter 8.)
Assets ↓−Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest ↓(expense)
6.5 A process for summarising the transactions: 
a spreadsheet
In Table 6.8 the transactions of Table 6.7 are repeated at the left-hand side and are 
analysed into columns headed for assets, liabilities and ownership interest using
brackets to show a negative amount. It would be equally acceptable to use a minus
sign but minus signs tend to disappear or be confused with unintentional blobs on the
paper, so brackets are frequently used in accounting in order to ensure clarity.
At the foot of the spreadsheet in Table 6.8 there is a total for each column. Those
totals are used in Table 6.9 to show the state of the accounting equation at the end of
the month. It may be used to explain to M. Carter how the ownership interest has
changed over the month. The owner contributed £50,000 at the start of the month and
has a claim of £50,150 at the end of the month. The ownership interest was increased
by earning revenue of £7,000 but reduced by incurring expenses of £5,850 and with-
drawing £1,000 for personal use.

How has the ownership interest changed over the month? The owner contributed
£50,000 at the start of the month and has a claim of £50,150 at the end of the month.
The ownership interest was increased by earning revenue of £7,000 but reduced by
incurring expenses of £5,850 and withdrawing £1,000 for personal use.
6.6 Financial statements of M. Carter, wholesaler
The transactions in Table 6.8 may be summarised in ﬁnancial statements for use by
interested parties. The ﬁrst user will be the owner, M. Carter, but others such as the
Inland Revenue may ask for a copy. If the owner seeks to raise additional ﬁnance 
by borrowing from a bank, the bank manager may ask for a copy of the ﬁnancial 
statements.
There are no regulations regarding the format of ﬁnancial statements for a sole
trader, but it is good practice to try to match, as far as possible, the more onerous
requirements imposed on limited liability companies. The ﬁnancial statements 
presented in this section follow the general formats set out in Chapter 3.

ﬂowed out of the business. A further £36,000 cash ﬂow was used for investing 
activities. The owner contributed £50,000 at the start of the month but withdrew 
£1,000 at the end of the month. Cash in the bank increased by £6,400 over the month.

Comment. This proﬁt and loss account differs slightly from that presented for the 
service business in Chapter 5. It has a subtotal for gross proﬁt. The difference between
sales and the cost of purchasing or manufacturing the goods sold is regarded as an
important indicator of the success of the business in its particular product line. The
gross proﬁt is sometimes referred to as the margin or gross margin and is a piece of
information which is much explored by professional investors and analysts.
Making a subtotal for gross proﬁt means that the ﬁnal line needs a different label and
so is called net proﬁt. The word ‘net’ means ‘after taking everything away’, so in this
case the net proﬁt is equal to sales minus all expenses of the operations of the business.
The business of M. Carter, wholesaler, has made a profit of £1,150 from operations during
the month but the cash flow due to operating activities has been negative to the extent of
£6,600. Make a comparison of the cash flow from operating activities and the profit from
operations. From your comparison, explain how a business can make a profit and yet see
its cash drain away. Then make some recommendations about reducing the outflow of
cash without affecting profit.

Comment. There are no liabilities at the end of the month and so the net assets are the
same as the total of ﬁxed assets and current assets. That somewhat artiﬁcial situation
arises from keeping the example fairly simple and manageable. The depreciation 
has been recorded for the equipment but many businesses would also depreciate
buildings. The useful life of a building is much longer than that of equipment and so
the depreciation for any single month would be a negligible amount in relation to
other information for the period. The amount of £35,750 has been described here as
depreciated cost but could also be called the net book value or the written down value.
The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) is a statement of position and, on
its own, is of limited usefulness. Companies which publish accounting information
will present the previous year’s amounts alongside the current year’s data so that
comparisons may be made. Some companies provide, in addition, ﬁve- or ten-year
summaries which allow comparison over a longer period.

Activity 6.5
It might be a useful test of your understanding of the chapter if you try to write down 
the debit and credit entries before looking at Table 6.11. If you find your answers don’t
agree with that table then you should go back to the analysis contained in the chapter
and think about the various aspects of the accounting equation. Debit and credit entries
do nothing more than follow the analysis based on the accounting equation so you should
not have a problem if you have followed the analysis.
Table 6.1 presented a short list of transactions for a trading company, relating to 
the purchase and sale of goods. That list of transactions is repeated in Table 6.11 but
showing in the ﬁnal two columns the ledger accounts in which debit and credit entries
would be made. Compare Table 6.11 with Table 6.2 to see that the analysis of trans-
actions and the analysis of debit and credit entries follow similar patterns.
Table 6.4 presented a short list of transactions for a manufacturing company. These
are repeated in Table 6.12 with the ledger accounts for debit and credit entries being
shown in the ﬁnal two columns. Again, you should try this ﬁrst and then check your
answer against Table 6.12.

LEONA’s comment: The amount of £50,000 put into the business at the start is quickly
swallowed up by spending cash on buildings, equipment, buying an inventory (stock) of
goods and paying the supplier who gave credit. Paying the electricity account £100 took
the cash balance down to £2,400 and it was only the sale of some goods which allowed
the business to continue. If the sale of goods had not taken place, the owner might have
needed to put more cash into the business at that point, or else ask the bank manager to
make a loan to the business. With the benefit of hindsight, the owner might have waited a
few days before paying R. Busby for goods supplied. It’s not a good idea to delay paying
the electricity bill in case there is a disconnection, and failing to pay wages usually means
the employee does not return. It might have helped cash flow to have bought the buildings
and equipment using a loan, but borrowing money has a cost in interest payments and 
perhaps the owner prefers not to start with a high level of borrowing.

LEONA’s comment: The ownership interest is created when the owner contributes cash or
resources to the business. In this case, it was cash. The sole trader in business may withdraw
cash for personal use at any time – it is called owner’s drawings – but the desirability of
that action depends on how useful it is to the owner when compared to how useful it might
have been if left in the business. The owner of this business has a claim remaining equal
to £49,000 after making the drawing.

LEONA’s comment: This ledger account is particularly useful as a reminder that a very valu-

owner to think about continuing care for the buildings and also to review their value against
the amount recorded.

LEONA’s comment: The equipment cost £6,000 but is being gradually used up over its life
in the business. Depreciation is a way of showing that the original cost of the asset has to
be spread over its useful life. If the estimate of depreciation is correct, this ledger account
should reduce to nil on the day the equipment ceases to be of use. In reality things usually
are not quite so straightforward. (Depreciation of fixed assets is dealt with in more detail in
Chapter 8.)

LEONA’s comment: The balance on this ledger account at any point in time should equal
the cost price of the goods held in the warehouse. So at the end of May, if the owner goes
to the warehouse and carries out an inventory count (stock count), there should be goods
to a total cost of £8,000. Checking the presence of an inventory (stock) of unsold goods
which agrees with the ledger account is an important part of my work as an auditor. If they
don’t agree, I start to ask a lot of questions.

LEONA’s comment: When the goods were purchased from R. Busby, the supplier, an
invoice was received from that supplier showing the amount due. That invoice was used to
make the credit entry on May 7 showing that the business had a liability. The liability was
extinguished on May 11 by a payment to R. Busby, so at the end of May the business owes
that supplier nothing.

the month. The total sales are shown in ledger account L10 as £7,000 and the cost of
goods sold is shown here as £3,500, so there is a profit (‘margin’) of 50% on sales before
taking into account the expenses of electricity, wages and depreciation. As an auditor 
I have considerable interest in the profit margin on sales. It tells me a great deal about 
the business.

LEONA’s comment: The credit sale to R. Welsby made him a trade receivable (debtor) of
the business and so the first entry is a debit entry. When R. Welsby paid this extinguished

LEONA’s comment: This is another expense account showing an item which has decreased
the ownership interest through a decrease in the recorded amount of an asset. This is where
accounting begins to look slightly complicated because no cash has changed hands.
Recording depreciation is the accounting way of expressing caution as to the expected
future benefits from the asset. These will be eroded as the asset is used up. Depreciation
is a way of acknowledging that erosion.
Checking the accuracy of double-entry records
In Chapter 5, the process of listing all ledger account balances in a trial balance was
explained.
The trial balance for the accounting records of M. Carter, wholesaler, at 31 May 
year 1, is as shown in Table 6.14. This is a basic list summarising the transactions 
of the month. If you compare it with the ﬁnancial statements in the main part of the
chapter you will see that all the amounts correspond.

As was the case in the supplement to Chapter 5, it is rather easier to use the trial 
balance if it is arranged so that all the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)
items are together and all the proﬁt and loss account items are together. This is done
in Table 6.15. The unshaded lines are not part of the trial balance but take advantage

7.1 Introduction
It is explained in Chapters 1 and 4 that in the case of sole traders and partnerships 
the groups of persons who have an interest in the ﬁnancial statements are limited to
the owners themselves, HM Revenue and Customs and organisations such as banks
which are asked to provide ﬁnance for the company. For limited liability companies
the list of potential users widens and the access to internal information becomes
restricted. Even the owners of a limited liability company, called the equity holders
(shareholders) are not permitted access to the day-to-day records of the company and
are treated as being outsiders of (external to) the company they own. The quality and
amount of information communicated to these users who are external to the company
becomes a matter which is too important to be left entirely to the discretion of the
directors running the company.
Chapter 4 outlined the various regulatory authorities which exist to establish the
quality and quantity of information to be published by limited liability companies.
There are over one million limited liability companies in the UK, although only a 
few thousand are listed on the Stock Exchange and of these only around 500 have their
shares bought and sold regularly. The number of major listed companies, and their
importance to the economy in terms of the funds invested in them, means it is appro-
priate to take them as the benchmark for current practice in external reporting. The
practices applied by larger limited liability companies set a good example as a starting
point for smaller ones and for organisations that are not limited liability companies,
such as charitable trusts or public sector bodies.
In this chapter, and in Chapters 8 to 12, there is mention only of limited liability
companies because the aim of this book is to provide an understanding of the account-
ing information published by companies. The more general word enterprise (meaning
a business activity or commercial project) could be substituted throughout for limited
liability company. Most of what is said in these chapters applies to all enterprises because
the principles and practice described here have a wider application beyond companies,
although modiﬁcations may be necessary when the needs of the users and the pur-
poses of the enterprise are different from those relevant to a limited liability company.
7.2 International influences
Chapter 3 explained that, since January 2005, two different accounting systems have
existed for companies in the UK, depending on the type of company. For the group
ﬁnancial statements of a listed company the accounting system set out by the Inter-
national Accounting Standards Board (IASB) must be applied. All other companies,
and the separate companies in the group, may choose to follow IASB standards but
there is no requirement to do so. Companies that do not choose to follow the inter-
national accounting standards must continue to follow the rules of UK company law
and the UK ASB’s accounting standards.
For many years there has been a strong international inﬂuence on and from UK
accounting practice so the change to international accounting standards in 2005 did
not bring many surprises. The UK accounting standard-setting body was a founder
member of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), set up in 1973,
and has been closely involved in its work since that date. In 2001, with an organis-
ational change, the IASC became the IASB but the close similarity between inter-
national accounting standards and UK accounting standards continued. The UK ASB
has worked continuously towards matching UK standards to IFRS.

Activity 7.1
Since 1980 the law regulating ﬁnancial reporting in the UK (now contained in 
the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation) has reﬂected its membership of the
European Union (EU) and the work of regulators across the EU to harmonise aspects
of ﬁnancial reporting. From 2005 the law governing ﬁnancial reporting in the UK has
been split into two routes. One route is the rule of UK company law inﬂuenced by the
EU. The other route is the IASB system of accounting as endorsed by the EU.
7.2.1
The European Union
The UK is a member state of the EU and is required to develop its laws so as to 
harmonise with those of other member states of the EU. There are two procedures 
by which the EU inﬂuences the accounting practices of UK-based companies.
1 The European Commission, which is the permanent secretariat and staff of the EU,
issues a Regulation which overrides national laws and applies to all companies
speciﬁed in the Regulation.
2 The European Commission issues Directives which are incorporated in national
laws of member states.
The IAS Regulation
In 2002 the European Commission issued the ﬁrst IAS Regulation. The IAS Regulation
is a direct instruction to companies in all member states. It required that, by 2005, 
all listed companies in the European Union would use IASB standards in preparing
their group ﬁnancial statements. This was intended to cause convergence (‘bringing
together’) of accounting practices, and so improve the movement of capital across the
stock markets of the EU. The Commission, which prepares and implements the legis-
lation of the European Parliament, has established procedures for giving European
approval to each of the IASB Standards. It takes advice from the European Financial
Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), a team of experts that includes a UK member.
The ﬁnal recommendation to the Commission is made by the Accounting Regulatory
Committee, which includes representatives of all member states. The process of
approving IASB standards for use in the EU is called endorsement.
Harmonisation through Directives
For many aspects of regulation within the EU, the process of harmonisation starts
when a Directive is issued by the European Commission, setting out the basic rules
which should be followed in each member state’s national laws. For limited liability
companies in the UK, two such Directives have been particularly important. These are
the Fourth Directive and the Seventh Directive. Together they specify the content of the
Companies Act 2006. One important aspect of Directives is that they specify formats
for the ﬁnancial statements (see section 7.3.2) which ensure that all companies produce
documents that are similar in appearance and present items in a systematic order. The
idea of having standard formats was not a familiar concept in the UK before the
Directives became effective in the 1980s, but became accepted during the 1980s and
1990. Having standard formats makes it easier for the reader to ﬁnd the starting point
in reading the ﬁnancial statements. In later chapters we will see that having standard
formats does not solve all the problems of comparability and understandability. For
companies that do not apply IFRS these formats continue to apply. For companies
using the IFRS there is potentially more ﬂexibility of presentation.
From your general interest reading, or perhaps from your study of law, make a list of other
areas of activity in which the UK law is harmonised with that of other countries in the EU.

7.2.2
IASB
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is an independent body that
sets International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It was formed in 2000 as 
the successor to the International Accounting Standard Committee (IASC) which had
been setting International Accounting Standards (IAS) since 1973. These IAS have
been adopted by the IASB and will gradually be revised as IFRS. In the meantime the
description ‘IFRS’ is used as a collective name for all forms of international accounting
standard, whatever the precise title of the standard.
The IASB’s objective is to bring about convergence of national accounting standards
and international accounting standards to high-quality solutions. This will help par-
ticipants in the world’s capital markets and other users to make economic decisions.
There are many similarities between the UK accounting standards and the IASB
Standards. There are also some differences where the UK standard-setter believes 
a particular approach is justiﬁed, or where historical developments have a strong
inﬂuence. The UK Accounting Standards Board works on projects with the IASB, 
as do other countries’ standard-setting bodies, all seeking to develop international
convergence.
7.3 Accounting framework
Chapter 1, section 1.3 has explained that the IASB has developed a Framework of prin-
ciples and deﬁnitions that are used in setting accounting standards. The UK ASB 
has also issued a Statement of Principles. There are many similarities between these 
documents because the UK ASB beneﬁted from the earlier work of the IASB. The
explanations in this chapter draw mainly on the IASB Framework, adding more 
information where this is needed to understand the separate ideas of the UK ASB.
7.3.1
The primary financial statements
The IASB requires a complete set of ﬁnancial statements to comprise:1
l a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) at the end of the period
l an income statement (showing the proﬁt or loss for the period), as part of a larger
statement of comprehensive income (see Chapter 12)
l a statement of changes in equity for the period
l a statement of cash ﬂows, and
l notes that summarise the accounting policies and give other explanations.
The IASB also gives general guidance on how to prepare and present the ﬁnancial
statements but stops short of giving precise rules on presentation. There is discretion
for companies to present information in a way that best suits the company and those
who are likely to use the information.
The UK ASB requires the same four primary statements but with some differences
of names. The income statement is called a proﬁt and loss account. The statement of
changes in equity is replaced by two items: a statement of total recognised gains and
losses and a note of changes in share capital and reserves (explained in Chapter 12 
of this book). The Companies Act 2006 sets out formats of ﬁnancial statements (see 
section 7.3.2) which give detailed rules on the sequence of information. These formats
apply to companies that do not follow the IFRS.
A comparison of the primary statements in the IASB and UK ASB systems is shown
in Table 7.1.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
168
The IASB’s Conceptual Framework states that the objective of general purpose ﬁnancial
reporting is to provide ﬁnancial information about the reporting entity that is useful to
existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about
providing resources to the entity. Those decisions involve buying, selling or holding
equity and debt instruments, and providing or settling loans and other forms of credit.2
Financial position
Information about ﬁnancial position is reported primarily in a statement of ﬁnancial
position (balance sheet). It reports economic resources controlled by the company, its
ﬁnancial structure, its liquidity and its solvency. Information about economic resources
held by the entity allows users of the information to estimate future cash ﬂows from
those resources. Information about ﬁnancial structure is useful in predicting future
needs for borrowing or for raising new equity ﬁnance. Liquidity refers to the avail-
ability of cash in the near future after taking account of commitments in the same
period. Solvency refers to the availability of cash to meet ﬁnancial commitments as
they fall due. The balance sheet is not a statement of the value of the company because
there are limitations in the measurement process and also because not all items which
are of value to the company are included in the balance sheet.
Performance
Information about the performance of an entity is primarily provided in an income
statement (proﬁt and loss account). Performance is indicated by proﬁtability and
changes in proﬁtability. Information about performance is useful in evaluating how
well the resources of the entity have been used to generate proﬁt. Statements of ﬁnan-
cial performance are seen as providing an account of the stewardship of management
and also as helping readers to check the accuracy of previous estimates they may have
made about the expected outcome of the period.
Changes in financial position
Information about changes in ﬁnancial position of an entity is useful to help assess the
operating, investing and ﬁnancing activities of the period. It is usually found in a state-
ment of cash ﬂows.

7.3.2
Formats for financial statements
The word format means ‘shape’. A format for a ﬁnancial statement sets out the shape
of the document. It sets out the items to be reported and the sequence in which they
are reported. Section 7.2.1 explains that EU Directives have guided the formats used
by UK companies for many years, as set out in company law and UK accounting stan-
dards. Since 2005 the group ﬁnancial statements of listed companies have followed the
IASB system of reporting. The IASB system does not specify formats. It does provide
some lists of items to be included in ﬁnancial statements but there is no requirement
to present these items in any particular sequence. This means that companies have
choices in the shape of their ﬁnancial statements. This book describes the shapes of
ﬁnancial statements that you are likely to see in company reports but you will need to
be ﬂexible in understanding that companies do have choices.
7.3.3
Categories of financial information
The primary ﬁnancial statements are the core of a much wider range of sources of
ﬁnancial information which users may obtain about a company. The relative position
of the primary ﬁnancial statements is shown in Figure 7.1.
Write down three items of accompanying information about a company which you feel
would be useful in the annual report of a company. Exchange lists with other members of
the group and establish the similarities and differences across the group. To what extent
would one general set of financial statements with notes and accompanying information
meet your collective expectations?
7.3.4
Notes and accompanying information
The annual report contains the primary ﬁnancial statements, notes to the ﬁnancial
statements and accompanying information.
Notes to the financial statements
For listed companies, notes to the ﬁnancial statements are based on required dis-
closures speciﬁed in the IFRS. For companies that do not follow the IFRS, many of the
notes are required by regulations such as the Companies Act 2006 or relevant UK
accounting standards. Where the annual report is audited, the full audit covers the
notes to the ﬁnancial statements.
The notes are essential in amplifying and explaining the primary ﬁnancial state-
ments. The notes and the primary ﬁnancial statements form an integrated whole. The
wording of the notes is as important as the numbers if ambiguity is to be avoided.
Notes provide narrative descriptions or disaggregations of items presented in those
statements and information about items that do not qualify for recognition in those
statements. An entity cannot rectify the use of an inappropriate accounting policy
merely by describing the accounting policy or by providing explanatory material.
Accompanying information
Accompanying information is any other information additional to the primary ﬁnan-
cial statements and notes. It could be information which is highly relevant but of lower
reliability than the ﬁnancial statements and notes. It could be information which will
only interest a particular group of users. Such accompanying information may not be
subject to the full audit process which is compulsory for the primary ﬁnancial state-
ments and notes. The IASB mandatory ﬁnancial reporting standards relate only to the
ﬁnancial statements and the notes to the ﬁnancial statements. There is non-mandatory

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
170
guidance on the management commentary (see Chapter 14). Accompanying infor-
mation is more commonly regulated at national level or is encouraged as voluntary by
organisations that encourage good practice. The range of accompanying information
found in the annual report of a UK listed company is explained later (see Chapter 14).
Many annual reports include highlights pages showing amounts, ratios and other
calculations that distil a great deal of information into a few key items. There is a risk
that companies are selective in how they choose the items for speciﬁc attention. You
cannot read about ﬁnancial statements for long without meeting the phrase ‘the bottom
line’. That refers to the line in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) which
reports the proﬁt attributable to the equity holders (ordinary shareholders). It may be
described as earnings for equity holders (ordinary shareholders). When this amount
Figure 7.1
Categories of financial information

Chapter 7 Published financial statements
171
is divided by the number of shares which have been issued by the company it becomes
the earnings per share. Investors, ﬁnancial journalists and brokers’ analysts have tra-
ditionally paid great attention to the earnings per share. The standard-setters would pre-
fer to discourage this narrow focus and encourage instead a ‘building block’ approach
where the company produces information in such a way that the user of the annual
statement can create useful arrangements and combinations of information.
Companies also produce accompanying information for specialised needs.
Regulated industries (such as gas, electricity, telecommunications and water) provide
supplementary information about their regulated activities. Some companies give
non-ﬁnancial performance indicators (such as speed of answering customer enquiries,
or level of customer satisfaction). Graphs, charts, diagrams and even photographs are
all ways of providing accompanying information which adds to users’ understanding
of a document.
7.4 Statement of financial position (balance sheet)
7.4.1
What items must be reported?
Companies that follow the IASB system of accounting in presenting a statement of
ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) have choices in the way they present their balance
sheet. There is no particular format required3 but some items are listed in the relevant
standard as a minimum set of disclosures (see Supplement 7.1 to this chapter).
Companies choose the form of layout for items in the balance sheet.
Companies that do not follow the IASB system of accounting must comply with the
Companies Act 2006 and the UK accounting standards. The Companies Act 2006 con-
tains more detail of the format that must be used. The details are set out in Supplement
7.2 to this chapter.
7.4.2
What formats are used?
Companies applying the IASB system do not have to follow any particular format but
it is likely that any balance sheet you see will resemble one of the three formats
described in this section because they will retain some of the traditions of the UK 
system that has existed for more than 20 years.
Companies that do not apply the IASB system of accounting must follow the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the standards of the UK ASB. The 
Companies Act 2006 permits two different formats of statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet), each conforming to the accounting equation but permitting different
layouts on the page. The word format means ‘shape’ so it covers the items to be
reported and the sequence in which they are reported. The most commonly used 
format in the UK is Format 1, which uses the accounting equation to create a vertical
format as shown in Exhibit 7.1.
Exhibit 7.1
Vertical format of statement of
financial position (balance sheet)
Assets
minus
Liabilities
equals

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
172
Format 2 uses the accounting equation to create a horizontal format as shown in
Exhibit 7.2.
Exhibit 7.2
Horizontal form of statement of financial position 
(balance sheet)

plus
Ownership interest
Format 2 is observed more commonly in the ﬁnancial statements of continental
European countries where the horizontal format is preferred.
Some companies use a variation on Format 2 which stacks the assets on top and the
ownership interest and liabilities underneath (see Exhibit 7.3).
Exhibit 7.3
Assets above, ownership interest plus liabilities below
Assets
equals
Liabilities
plus
Ownership interest
When you read a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) you should ﬁrst of
all look at the overall structure to see where the main sections of assets, liabilities and
ownership interest are placed. Then you can begin to look at each section in more
detail. The process is something like seeing a landscape painting for the ﬁrst time. You
stand back to look at the overall impression of the landscape and the main features
ﬁrst. Then you step forward to look at some of the details in different parts of the
painting. Finally if you are very enthusiastic you move in closer and start to examine
the details of the texture, brush strokes and shading.
7.4.3
Descriptions in the statement of financial position (balance sheet)
You will see from the Supplement that the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet) formats contain some words you will recognise but also many new words. Non-
current assets (ﬁxed assets) are separated from current assets. Current liabilities (due
in less than one year) are separated from non-current liabilities (due in more than one
year). Some of the items under the Companies Act headings A to J may look rather
strange at this stage (particularly A, D, I and J). Do not worry about that at present. If
they are appropriate to ﬁrst-level study they will be explained at some point in this
text. If they are not explained, then they are relatively rare in occurrence and the time
taken to explain them will outweigh the beneﬁts you would gain from understanding.
The ownership interest is shown at heading K as capital and reserves. The word
capital here means the claim which owners have because of the number of shares 
they own, and the word reserves means the claim which owners have because the

company has created new wealth for them over the years. Various labels are used to
describe the nature of that new wealth and how it is created. Some of the new wealth
is created because new investors pay more than a speciﬁed amount for the shares.
Paying more is referred to as paying a premium, so this kind of ownership interest is
labelled the share premium. Some of the new wealth is created because the ﬁxed assets
held by the company increase in value and that new valuation is recorded. This kind
of ownership interest is labelled the revaluation reserve. Some of the new wealth is
created by making proﬁts through operating activities. This kind of ownership 
interest is labelled the retained earnings reserve.
7.4.4
Subtotals
Subtotals in ﬁnancial statements help to group information within ﬁnancial statements
into useful sections. There are no rules about the placing of subtotals in either the IASB
lists or the Companies Acts formats. Companies have to decide for themselves where
to place subtotals and totals in presentation of the list of items in the format. You will
need to be ﬂexible in reading statements of ﬁnancial position (balance sheets) and
using the subtotals provided.
Read again the format for the balance sheet. How many of the items there came as no
surprise to you? How many looked unfamiliar? Make a note of these and check that you
find out about them in later chapters.

Illustration
The remainder of this chapter explores the published ﬁnancial statements of a hypo-
thetical listed company, Safe and Sure plc, which operates in a service industry. There
is a parent company called Safe and Sure plc and it owns some subsidiary companies
that together make up a ‘group’. The Safe and Sure Group sells recycling and cleaning
services to customers based on the high reputation of the company’s products and
name. The Safe and Sure Group follows the IASB system of accounting and has 
chosen a format that is similar to Format 1 (see Exhibit 7.1).
The following illustration sets out the balance sheet of the Safe and Sure Group plc
for Year 7 with comparative amounts alongside for the previous year. The balance
sheet is followed by a comment on matters of particular interest.

Discussion
The ﬁrst feature to note is the title, Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet). Companies listed on the Stock Exchange are generally using one name as an
umbrella for a group of several companies linked together under one parent. It is
thought to be more useful to the shareholders of the parent company to see all the
assets controlled by that company within the single ﬁnancial statement. The word
control is important here. The parent company owns the other companies. They each
own their separate assets. The parent company controls the use of those assets in-
directly by controlling the companies it owns. The statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet) as presented here represents a group where the parent company owns
100% of all the other companies in the group (called its subsidiary undertakings). A
similar consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position would be produced if the parent
owned less than 100%, provided it had the same element of control. The only ad-
ditional item would be a non-controlling interest in the ownership claim to indicate
the proportion of the equity interest in subsidiaries held by shareholders outside the
group. The non-controlling interest has previously been called the minority interest.
The second feature to note in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) as
presented is that there are two columns of ﬁgures. Companies are required to present
the ﬁgures for the previous year, in order to provide a basis for comparison.
The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) follows the accounting equation
and this company has helpfully set out in the left-hand margin the main elements of
the equation. There are some phrases in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet) which you are meeting for the ﬁrst time but you should not feel intimidated by
new titles when you can work out what they mean if you think about the ordinary
meanings of words.
Intangible assets means assets which may not be touched – they have no physical exist-
ence. Examples are the goodwill of a business or the reputation of a branded product.
Property, plant and equipment is another phrase which you are seeing here for the
ﬁrst time, but again you can work out the meaning. It is also called tangible non-current
assets. You know from Chapter 2 what non-current assets are and you know that 
tangible means ‘something that may be touched’.
Investments here means shares in other companies which are not subsidiary under-
takings within the group.

The taxation recoverable is an amount of tax which has been paid already but may be
reclaimed in 18 months’ time because of events that have occurred to reduce the tax
due, after the tax was paid.
Current assets comprise inventories (stocks), receivables (debtors) and cash. They are
set out in order of increasing liquidity. Inventories (stocks) are the least readily convert-
ible into cash while amounts receivable (debtors) are closer to collection of cash. Cash
itself is the most liquid asset. The notes to the accounts contain more detailed infor-
mation. Take as an example note 4, relating to inventories (stocks). It appears as follows:

The notes are shown in full in Appendix I at the end of this book. There is a note
relating to amounts receivable (debtors), mainly relating to trade receivables (trade
debtors). Amounts payable (creditors) has a similar type of note to the balance sheet.
The non-current liabilities include long-term borrowings, which are quite low in
amount compared with those of many other companies of this size. The provisions
relate to future obligations caused by: treating a contaminated site; reorganisation of
part of the business; and future tax payable.
That stage of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) concludes with the
net assets, deﬁned as all assets minus all liabilities. Drawing a total at this point is 
not a requirement of any format, but is used by many companies as the point which
creates a pause in the balance sheet before moving on to the ownership interest.
For a company the ownership interest is described as capital and reserves. The owner-
ship interest in a company is speciﬁed in company law as comprising the claim 
created through the shares owned by the various equity holders (shareholders) and
the claim representing additional reserves of wealth accumulated since the company
began. That wealth is accumulated by making proﬁts year after year. The claim is
reduced when the owners take dividends from the company. (Further information on
the reporting of share capital, reserves and dividends is contained in Chapter 12.)
The ownership interest is the part of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet) which causes greatest confusion to most readers. It is purely a statement of a
legal claim on the assets after all liabilities have been satisﬁed. The word reserves has no
other signiﬁcance. There is nothing to see, touch, count or hold. To add to the potential
confusion, company law delights in ﬁnding names for various different kinds of 
ownership interest. If you are the kind of person who takes a broad-brush view of life
you will not worry too much about share premium account, revaluation reserve and
retained earnings. They are all part of accounting terminology which becomes import-
ant to a company lawyer when there is a dispute over how much dividend may be
declared, but are less important to the investor who says ‘How much is my total claim?’
7.5 Income statement (profit and loss account)
7.5.1
What items must be reported?
Companies that follow the IASB system of accounting in presenting an income state-
ment must report the proﬁt or loss for the period. There is no particular format
required4 but some items are listed in the relevant standard as a minimum set of 
disclosures (see Supplement 7.4 to this chapter). Companies choose the form of layout
of the items in the income statement.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
176
Companies that do not follow the IASB system of accounting must comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and the UK accounting standards. The Companies Act 2006
contains more detail of the items to be reported and the format that must be used. The
details are set out in Supplement 7.3 to this chapter.
7.5.2
What formats are used?
Companies applying the IASB system do not have to follow any particular format but
it is likely that any income statement (proﬁt and loss account) you see will resemble
one of the formats described in this section because they will retain some of the tra-
ditions of the UK system that has existed for more than 20 years.
Companies that do not apply the IASB system of accounting must follow the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the standards of the UK ASB. The Com-
panies Act 2006 permits four different formats of proﬁt and loss account but the 
version most frequently observed in the UK is format 1 (see Supplement 7.4).

Discussion
The ﬁrst point to note is the heading. This is a consolidated income statement (proﬁt
and loss account) bringing together the results of the activities of all the companies 
in the group during the year. The individual companies will also produce their own
separate proﬁt and loss accounts and these are added together to produce the con-
solidated picture. Where one company in the group sells items to another in the group,
the sale and purchase are matched against each other on consolidation so that the
results reported reﬂect only sales to persons outside the group.
The second point to note is that the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) 
as presented by the company is more informative than the lists contained in Supple-
ments 7.3 or 7.4 might suggest. That is partly because the company has used subtotals
to break up the ﬂow and make it digestible for the reader. One very common subtotal

Chapter 7 Published financial statements
177
is the gross profit calculated as revenue minus the cost of the goods or services sold
as revenue.
Starting at the top of the income statement we see that the word revenue is used to
describe the sales of goods or services. Revenue is sometimes described as turnover or
sales. Revenue (turnover) represents sales to third parties outside the group of com-
panies. The cost of sales is the total of the costs of materials, labour and overheads
which relate closely to earning the sales. The gross proﬁt is sometimes referred to as
the gross margin and is monitored closely by those who use the ﬁnancial statements
to make a judgement on the operations of the company. Within any industry the gross
proﬁt as a percentage of revenue (or turnover, or sales) is expected to be within known
limits. If that percentage is low then the company is either underpricing its goods or
else taking the market price but failing to control costs. If the percentage is high, then
the company is perhaps a market leader which can command higher prices for its out-
put because of its high reputation. However, it might also be seen by customers and
competitors as charging too much for its goods or services.
The next item in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) is distribution costs,
which would include the costs of delivering goods to customers. For this company the
distribution costs are low because it provides services by contract and does not carry
out much distribution work. For many users the trends in an amount are more interest-
ing than the actual amount. They might ask why the amount has decreased. On the
other hand, it is not a particularly signiﬁcant component of the overall picture and the
users might show little interest. They would pay more attention to the administrative
expenses, a collective term for all those costs which have to be incurred in order to keep
the business running but which are less closely related to the direct activity of creating
revenue (making sales). The directors’ salaries, head ofﬁce costs and general mainten-
ance of buildings and facilities are the kinds of details brought together under this
heading. Directors’ salaries are always a matter of some fascination and companies are
expected to give considerable detail in the notes to the accounts about how much each
director is paid and what other beneﬁts are provided.
The proﬁt from operations is the end of the ﬁrst stage of the income statement (proﬁt
and loss account), where the story of the business operations is complete. The rest of
the proﬁt and loss account is concerned with the cost of ﬁnancing the company.
As an example of ﬁnance costs, interest is paid on loans and received on investments,
usually brought together in one net amount which shows, in this case, an excess of
interest receivable over interest payable. That suggests a fairly cash-rich company with
relatively low levels of borrowing. Next comes the corporation tax, which all companies
must pay as a percentage of the proﬁt before tax. The percentage is a standard per-
centage applied to the proﬁt calculated according to the tax rules. Because the tax rules
are not identical to the accounting rules, the percentage appears to vary when the
reader looks at the income statement. Helpful companies will explain the tax charge
in the Operating and Financial Review, as well as providing more detailed notes to the
accounts on the tax charge.
That information ends with the proﬁt for the period from continuing operations.
Investors or analysts who want to make a forecast of future proﬁts may decide to use
this ﬁgure as a starting point because the activities will continue. Separately below this
line the group shows the results in this period of operations that have been discon-
tinued. Usually operations are discontinued because they are performing poorly so it
is no great surprise to see a loss here. The loss is part of the performance of the period
but investors can see that the bad news of this operation will not continue in future.
Finally the equity holders (ordinary shareholders) see the proﬁt for the period at-
tributable to them.
They do not see here any mention of a reward in the form of a dividend which
returns to them some of the wealth created by the company during the period. That

information will appear in a statement of changes in equity which is explained in
Chapter 12.
7.6 Statement of cash flows
The presentation of cash ﬂow statements by companies is guided by IAS 7, Statement
of Cash Flows. (There is a UK standard, FRS 1, which sets out a different form of cash
ﬂow statement,5 but in this chapter the version required by IAS 7 is used because it is
more likely that you will ﬁnd this one in published ﬁnancial statements.)
The beneﬁts of cash ﬂow information are explained in IAS 7.6 A statement of cash
ﬂows, when used in conjunction with the rest of the ﬁnancial statements, provides
users with information on solvency and liquidity. It shows how cash is generated in
the business and helps users to understand how much ﬂexibility is available to adapt
to changing circumstances and opportunities.
7.6.1
What items must be reported?
The statement of cash ﬂows presents three classiﬁcations of cash ﬂows.7 These are:
l operating activities
l investing activities
l ﬁnancing activities.
Definitions
Operating activities are the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity and other
activities that are not investing or financing activities.
Investing activities are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other
investments not included in cash equivalents.
Financing activities are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of
the contributed equity and borrowings of the entity.
Safe and Sure uses these classiﬁcations, as shown in the next section. We need 
two more deﬁnitions of terms in the cash ﬂow statement. These are cash and cash
equivalents.
Definitions
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.8

7.6.3
Discussion
The ﬁrst line of the statement of cash ﬂows is cash ﬂows from operating activities, highlighted
by the company as an important feature. Note 23 to the accounts explains why this is
not the same as operating proﬁt. When a company makes a proﬁt it earns revenue
which is greater than the expenses. Some of the revenue is collected as cash but some
will be collected later when the credit customers pay. When expenses are incurred, some
are paid for immediately but others relate to goods and services taken from suppliers.
Note 23 to the accounts is set out above and shows that cash is generated by proﬁts
but is used when inventory (stock) levels increase and when trade receivables (debtors)
increase. Allowing inventories (stocks) to increase will use up cash because more has
to be paid for them. Allowing trade receivables (debtors) to increase means that credit
customers are not paying the cash so fast and therefore the cash is not coming in. That
will diminish cash ﬂow. Allowing trade payables (creditors) to decrease is a further
way of diminishing cash ﬂow because it means that suppliers are being paid faster.
There is one other line in note 23 which gives pause for thought. That is the fourth
line, depreciation charge. Depreciation is a measure of how much a non-current (ﬁxed)
asset has been used up. It is an amount which is deducted from proﬁts as a measure of
using up the cost of the non-current (ﬁxed) asset in the accounting period. It does not
of itself generate cash, but it stops the owners removing so much cash from the company

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
180
that they are unable to replace a non-current (ﬁxed asset) at the end of its useful life.
Since it is not a cash item it has to be added back to the reported proﬁt. By way of 
illustration, suppose a company pays £100 for goods and sells them for £150. It has
generated £50 cash. In the income statement £10 is deducted for depreciation, so the
reported proﬁt becomes £40. The reconciliation of proﬁt to cash ﬂow from operations
will be written as:
£
Operating profit
40
add Depreciation
10
Cash inflow from operating activities
50
(There is more about depreciation in Chapter 8 and more about cash ﬂow in
Chapter 14.)
The cash generated from operations is used ﬁrst of all to pay interest on loans, as a
reward to lenders, and to pay taxation to the government. Deducting these items
leaves the net cash from operating activities. This is the amount left over for long-term
investment.
In the next section we ﬁnd the cash ﬂows from investing activities. The purchase of
tangible non-current (ﬁxed) assets is also called capital expenditure. Cash is paid to
purchase new businesses and cash is received from selling companies or businesses no
longer required. Safe and Sure has put some of its cash into short-term deposits to earn
interest. In Year 6, Safe and Sure reduced the amount on short-term deposit, converting
it back to cash that was available for spending, but in Year 7 it increased the amount
on deposit, reducing the amount of cash available to spend in other ways. The ﬁnal
item in this investment section is interest received which is the reward for investment.
The third section shows the cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities. For some com-
panies the cash inﬂow from operating activities may be insufﬁcient to cover all the
investment requirements for capital expenditure and acquisitions, so more ﬁnance has
to be raised from external sources. Safe and Sure is not in such a difﬁcult position
because the cash generated from operations is greater than the cash paid out for
investing activities. However, there is one further important outﬂow in the dividends
paid to equity holders (shareholders). Dividend is the reward to equity holders (share-
holders) for investing in the company. For the particular cash ﬂow statement pre-
sented here, the broad story is that the company generated sufﬁcient cash from its
operations to cover loan interest, to pay the tax due, meet its investment needs and
pay dividends. Despite that positive amount, the company has increased its loans 
by £16.2m and marginally increased its share capital by £3.1m, so that a total of 
£34.5m has been added to cash and deposits repayable on demand.
The company explained its cash ﬂow management as follows in the Operating and
Financial Review: ‘The group’s businesses are structured to use as little ﬁxed and
working capital as is consistent with the proﬁt and earnings growth objective in order
to produce a high cash ﬂow.’
DAVID WILSON comments on cash flow in the company.
Cash is an important factor for any business. It is only one of the resources available but
it is the key to survival.
What I’m basically looking for in the statement of cash flows is how well the company is 
balancing various sources of finance. It generated £196.7m from operating activities. The
servicing of investment cost £3.1m in loan interest and the company paid taxes of £50.6m.
That left net cash from operations amounting to £143.0m. That was used to cover its invest-
ing activities in new non-current (fixed) assets costing £48m (£60m less £12m) and acqui-
sitions costing £24.6m after allowing for the sale of a company. Cash was used to increase
short-term deposits by £30.7m. Interest received was £5m. The net cash used for investing
activities amounted to £98.3m. If I deduct this from the £143m cash flow generated there

Chapter 7 Published financial statements
181
is an increase in cash of £44.7m. The company had to pay a dividend of £29.5m, leaving
£15.2m surplus cash. There was no immediate need for any long-term financing flows with
a healthy cash flow like that. Nevertheless the company raised £3.1m in cash through an
issue of shares to the employees’ share option scheme and, perhaps surprisingly, there
was an increase of £16.2m in short-term loans. Add the £15.2m to the £3.1m and £16.2m
and you arrive at £34.5m which is the increase in cash and cash equivalents of the period.
That brings me back to my earlier question of why they are holding so much cash and
short-term deposits.
The company in this example has told me that it carries out its financial management 
by recognising that the tax bill has to be paid first of all. Then it plans its investment in 
non-current (fixed) assets and its programme of disposals. Once the investment has been
decided the company aims to pay a dividend which will satisfy the expectations of investors.
Surplus cash after that is available for acquisition of other companies and, because this
company is always looking for good opportunities to expand, it will borrow ahead of time
so that it is in a position to move quickly when a target presents itself. The company does
not agree with IAS 7’s requirement to separate out the bank deposits which had more than
three months to run when they were made. The deposits are placed largely for six months,
so that many have less than six months to run at the balance sheet date. It is all very access-
ible cash and the company sees it all as one pool.
In the Operating and Financial Review the finance director explains the company’s view
of cash flow as follows:
The Group’s businesses are structured to utilise as little fixed and working capital 
as is consistent with the profit and earnings growth objective in order to produce a
high cash flow. The impact of working capital on cash flow was held to an increase
in Year 7 of £9.7m (Year 6: £10.0m).
A net cash flow of £196.7m was generated from operating activities. That was
boosted by other amounts of cash from interest received. After paying interest and
tax, the Group had £143.0m remaining. Fixed assets required £48.0m after allowing
for the proceeds of selling some of our vehicle fleet in the routine replacement
programme. That left £95m from which £24.6m was required to pay for acquisitions.
The remaining £70.4m covered dividends of £29.5m leaving £40.9m. We received
£5m interest on investments and raised £3.1m in ordinary share capital to give a net
inflow of liquid funds in the year of £49.0m. Out of that amount, short-term deposits
have increased by £14.5m, leaving an increase in cash of £34.5m.
You can see there are lots of different ways of interpreting the information in the cash
flow statement. What is important is that the information is available.
7.7 Group structure of companies
Most major companies in the UK operate using a group structure. Within a group
there is a parent company which controls subsidiary companies undertaking various
different aspects of the operations of the business. It would in theory be possible to
have all the operations located within one company but in practice, because company
law draws very tight boundaries around a single company, there is some safety for the
organisation in having different parts of the business packaged separately. If some-
thing goes seriously wrong with one subsidiary company, that company may be
allowed to fail without irreparable damage to the total group. This approach has not
always worked out in practice because very often the banks which lend money to a

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
182
subsidiary will request guarantees from other companies in the group. So if one 
subsidiary fails in a spectacular way, it may drag the rest of the group with it.
Other reasons for retaining separate subsidiaries include: employee loyalty, prod-
uct reputation, taxation legislation and overseas operations. When a new company is
taken into the group, a sense of pride in the formerly independent company may be
retained by continuing to use the traditional company name. The company name may
be linked to a reputation for a high-quality product so that it is desirable to perpetu-
ate the beneﬁt of that reputation. Tax legislation applies to individual companies and
not to the group as a whole. Efﬁcient use of the tax laws may require different types
of business to operate in different companies. Operations located in other countries
will come under the legal systems of those countries and may be required to have a
separate legal identity.
For accounting purposes the group as a whole is the economic entity for which
ﬁnancial statements are prepared. An entity should prepare and publish ﬁnancial
statements if ﬁnancial information about the economic activities of that entity has the
potential to be useful in making decisions about providing resources to the entity and
in assessing whether the management and the governing board have made efﬁcient
and effective use of the resources provided.9 The process of combining all the ﬁnancial
statements of the companies within a group is called consolidation. This chapter will
explain sufﬁcient aspects of the preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements to
allow an understanding of annual reports of groups of companies. The full complex-
ities of consolidation and the wider aspects of group accounting may be found in
advanced textbooks.
Definition
Consolidated financial statements are the financial statements of a group in which the
assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent and its
subsidiaries are presented as those of a single economic entity.10
Consolidated financial statements recognise the parent’s control of its subsidiaries.
Consolidation is a process that aggregates the total assets, liabilities and results of all
companies in the group. The consolidated balance sheet brings together all the assets
controlled by the parent and shows all the liabilities to be satisﬁed from those assets.
The consolidated income statement (proﬁt and loss account) brings together all the
revenues and costs of the companies in the group.
7.7.1
Defining a group
The smallest group consists of two companies. A group is created when one company
(the parent) has control of another company (the subsidiary). There is no upper limit
to the number of companies which may form a group.
The IASB has deﬁned a group as a parent and all its subsidiaries.11 A parent is an
entity that controls one or more other entities.12 A subsidiary is an entity, including an
unincorporated entity such as a partnership, that is controlled by another entity
(known as the parent).13 Consolidated ﬁnancial statements must include all sub-
sidiaries of the parent, apart from some limited exemptions.14
Control is deﬁned by the IASB. An investor controls an investee when it is exposed,
or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.15 There are three 
elements to this deﬁnition of control. The investor must have all of the following:16
(a) power over the investee;
(b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s
returns.

Activity 7.4
Chapter 7 Published financial statements

7.7.2
The nature of control
The IASB has explained the reason for the deﬁnition of control used in IFRS 10. The
need arose from the global ﬁnancial crisis that started in 2007. Subsequent to the 
crisis it was found that some of the banks and other ﬁnancial entities affected by 
the crisis had exposed investors to risk through using ‘off balance sheet vehicles’. Polit-
ical leaders of major economies across the world (the G20 leaders) asked the IASB to
review the accounting and disclosure requirements for such ‘off balance sheet vehicles’.
The IASB found that the conditions applied were not always clear and consistent. IFRS
10 is the attempt to create that clarity and consistency.
Take each of the components of control in turn. Power over the investee is established
by having rights that are capable of being exercised in practice. The most obvious right
is a majority voting right as a shareholder in the investee. If the investor does not have
a clear majority, there could nevertheless be control if other investors are passive. The
investor might have control through agreements with other investors. The investor
might have the right to appoint or remove the majority of the board of directors. It is
important to consider the facts of the case in deciding whether there is control.
The second component is a variable return. Such a return could be a dividend, share
repurchase, or a surplus on winding up. It could be a fee, tax beneﬁt, or cost saving.
The standard does not give an exhaustive list. Again all the facts must be considered.
Finally the investor must be able to exercise the power to inﬂuence the return. As
examples: the investor might be able to vote for the amount of dividend payable; 
or the investor might be able to instruct the directors on the amount of dividend to 
be paid.

The parent company’s statement of financial position
In some annual reports the parent company may choose to continue to produce its
own statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet), showing as an asset the cost of 
the investment in the subsidiary, but this information is not regarded as being par-
ticularly useful. The investment in the subsidiary is reported by the parent company
as a single-line item but the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position shows all the
assets and all the liabilities of the group under each separate heading. The group state-
ment of ﬁnancial position is more useful to readers. In previous chapters, where the
ﬁnancial statements of Safe and Sure plc have been discussed, the group accounts
have been used.
7.7.4
Acquisition
The general term business combination may be applied to any transaction whereby
one company becomes a subsidiary of another. The most common form of business
combination is an acquisition where one party (the acquirer) is clearly the dominant
entity and the other (the acquiree) is seen to be under new control. The method of
accounting used to produce consolidated ﬁnancial statements in an acquisition is
called the acquisition method17 (sometimes described as the purchase method). In this
introductory text you do not need to worry about the details of the method of pro-
ducing consolidated ﬁnancial statements. All you need to do is recognise the descrip-
tions used and be aware that when you see these words you are reading information
about a group of companies combined.
Check your understanding of the terms: parent, subsidiary, control, acquisition. Write
down a definition of each and then look back through this section to test your definition
against that in the text.

7.8 Group financial statements
This section explains how the acquisition of a subsidiary affects the balance sheet of
the parent company. It shows how the group’s balance sheet and income statement
(proﬁt and loss account) are created. It also explains the nature of goodwill arising on
acquisition and it outlines the nature and treatment of associated companies.
7.8.1
The parent company’s balance sheet
When an acquisition takes place, the parent company acquires shares in the subsidiary
in exchange for cash or for shares in the parent. The parent company will offer cash if
it has adequate cash resources to make the offer and it appears that those selling the
shares would prefer to take cash for investment elsewhere. The parent company will
offer its own shares in exchange where it may not have sufﬁcient cash resources avail-
able or where it thinks it can persuade those selling their shares in the target company
of the desirability of acquiring shares in the new parent. Many deals offer a mixture of
shares and cash.
For a cash purchase the effect on the parent company’s balance sheet, in terms of
the accounting equation, is:
Assets ↑↓
−
Liabilities
=
Ownership interest
Decrease in asset of cash

For a share exchange, the effect on the parent company’s balance sheet is to increase
the assets and increase the ownership interest. In terms of the accounting equation:

7.8.2
The group’s consolidated statement of financial position
In the group’s consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position the parent company’s assets
and liabilities are added to the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary companies. The
assets and liabilities of the subsidiary take the place of the parent company’s investment
in the subsidiary. Figure 7.2 shows the net assets of P and S separately. The arrows
indicate the net assets of S moving in to take the place of P’s investment in S. Removing

Activity 7.5
Chapter 7 Published financial statements

the investment in S from the statement of ﬁnancial position of P and replacing it with
the net assets of S leads to the group’s consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position.
Figure 7.3(a) shows the resulting amalgamation. The assets and liabilities in Figure 7.3(a)
are then rearranged under each asset and liability category to result in Figure 7.3(b).
7.8.3
The group income statement (profit and loss account)
Investors and their advisers may wish to use the income statement (proﬁt and loss
account) of the group to make predictions of the future proﬁtability of the group. To
be able to do this, they must know how much of the current year’s proﬁt relates to con-
tinuing operations and how much relates to changes during the year. The illustration
of the income statement of Safe and Sure plc in section 7.5.3 shows how the consolidated
proﬁt and loss is subdivided into continuing activities and discontinued activities.
One rule of acquisition accounting is that, where a subsidiary is acquired part-way
through the year, only the proﬁts earned after the date of acquisition may be included
in the group income statement. The analyst seeking to make a forecast for the year
ahead will be helped by a note to the accounts showing what the proﬁt would have
been from a full 12-month contribution.
Groups are not required to present separately the parent company’s income state-
ment (proﬁt and loss account). It is not felt to be particularly interesting to users as,
generally, the parent company’s main income comprises the dividends received from
its investments in subsidiaries. Usually it is the subsidiaries which carry out the 
operations generating proﬁt. It is far more interesting to know about the underlying
operating proﬁts which allow those dividends to be paid to the parent.
P plc pays cash of £6m for an investment in net assets of S Ltd having a net book value
(equal to fair value) of £6m. Explain how this transaction will affect the balance sheet of 
P plc as the parent company and explain how it will affect the group balance sheet of 
P Group plc, whose only subsidiary is S Ltd.
7.8.4
Goodwill on acquisition
In the illustration presented in Figure 7.2 and Figure 7.3 the net assets of the subsidiary
were shown as being of the same magnitude as the amount of the investment in the
Figure 7.3

subsidiary so that the substitution of the former for the latter was a neat replacement
process. That situation is unlikely to apply in real life because the price paid for an
investment will rarely depend solely on the net assets being acquired. The purchaser
will be looking to the future expectations from the investment and the seller will be
seeking a reward for all that has been built into the business which cannot readily be
quantiﬁed in terms of tangible assets. The future expectations will rest upon the repu-
tation of the product or service, the quality of the customers, the skills of the workforce
and the state of the order book, amongst many other things. The price negotiated for
the business will include some recognition of all these qualities under the global head-
ing of goodwill.
In these circumstances the price paid for the investment in the subsidiary will be
greater than the amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. When the consoli-
dation into the group statement of ﬁnancial position is attempted, a space will appear.
Figure 7.4 shows the separate net assets of P plc and S plc. The amount of the cost of
the investment in S is greater than the net assets of S plc.
Figure 7.4
Net assets of the separate companies P plc and S plc
Figure 7.5
Group net assets of the P group
Figure 7.5 shows the resulting consolidation. The space shaded is equal to the dif-
ference between the amount of the investment in S and the net assets of S. This space
is, in arithmetic terms, nothing more than a difference on consolidation but has tra-
ditionally been called goodwill because it is explained in terms of paying for something
more than the underlying net assets.
Definition
Goodwill is defined as an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from
other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and
separately recognised.18
Goodwill is recognised in the statement of financial position as an asset and is measured
as the excess of the cost of the business combination over the fair value of the net
assets acquired.19

Activity 7.6
Chapter 7 Published financial statements
187
The existence of a difference on consolidation is an inescapable consequence of the
process of combining the statements of ﬁnancial position of parent and subsidiary. 
For many years it caused one of the most difﬁcult problems facing the accounting 
standard-setters. The questions asked were: ‘How should this consolidation difference
be reported in the balance sheets of succeeding years?’ and ‘Is it an asset?’
After a great deal of international debate and disagreement, the IASB has taken the
view that acquisition goodwill is an asset that should be tested regularly by means of
an impairment test which asks, ‘Can the business expect to recover the carrying value
of the intangible asset, through either using it or selling it?’ If the answer is ‘no’ then
the asset is impaired and its value must be reduced. An expense of impairment will
appear in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account). If the answer is ‘yes’ then the
asset value should remain in the balance sheet.
Definition
Impairment means ‘damaged’ or ‘spoiled’. Where the carrying value of goodwill 
cannot be recovered through sale or use, it is said to be ‘impaired’. The asset value 
in the balance sheet must be reduced.
P pays cash of £8m for an investment in net assets of S Ltd having a net book value
(equal to fair value) of £6m. Explain how this transaction will affect the statement of
financial position of P plc as the parent company and explain how it will affect the group
statement of financial position of P Group plc, whose only subsidiary is S Ltd.
7.8.5
Associated companies
Where company P holds less than a controlling interest in company A, it may never-
theless have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence over company A. Such signiﬁcant inﬂuence would
involve the power to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of 
company A. Signiﬁcant inﬂuence is presumed to exist when one company or a group
of companies holds 20% or more of the ordinary shareholders’ voting rights of another
company, unless the facts indicate that signiﬁcant inﬂuence is not possible.20
Where signiﬁcant inﬂuence over a company exists, that company is called an asso-
ciated company. The group must show in its balance sheet the group’s share of the net
assets of the associated company as a single-line item, and must show in the income
statement (proﬁt and loss account) the group’s share of the proﬁts or losses of the asso-
ciated company.
This treatment of an investment in an associated company is called equity account-
ing because it reports the parent’s and the group’s share of the investment in the 
ownership interest (also referred to as the equity).
For investments which do not meet the conditions of being reported as associated
companies, the accounting treatment is to record the investment at cost in the balance
sheet and to record in the income statement of the group only the dividend income
received from the associate.
7.9 Small and medium-sized entities (SMEs)
7.9.1
Definitions
The amount of detail in the information presented by companies depends on their
size. The Companies Act 2006 deﬁnes small and medium-sized companies. The deﬁ-
nitions are based on turnover, balance sheet totals and average number of employees.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
188
Currently the limits for a small company are satisfying two or more of the conditions:
turnover not more than £5.6m, balance sheet total not more than £2.8m and employees
not more than 50 (section 382). The limits for a medium-sized company are satisfying
two or more of the conditions: turnover not more than £22.8m, balance sheet total not
more than £11.4m and employees not more than 250 (section 465). The amounts for
turnover and balance sheet totals are altered from time to time by Statutory Instru-
ment to keep pace with inﬂation, so it is perhaps easiest to take as a ‘rule of thumb’ the
employee limits of 50 for a small company and 250 for a medium-sized company. For
these companies there are substantial exemptions from requirements to publish infor-
mation (although they must still provide details to shareholders if asked to do so).
Generally they are not listed companies and so are not required to meet the obligations
placed on listed companies. Most of these small and medium-sized companies are 
currently presenting ﬁnancial statements based on UK ASB standards and company
law. Section 7.9.2 explains proposals for change that will affect these companies.
During the 1980s, concerns were expressed about the ‘burden’ of regulation for
small companies. This burden was seen as falling from all directions, including tax
laws, employment laws, product protection laws, health and safety laws and account-
ing regulation. The government of the time committed itself to reducing this burden.
One consequence was that the UK Accounting Standards Board introduced a Financial
Reporting Standard for Smaller Entities (FRSSE). This condenses into one standard 
the essential aspects of all the separate accounting standards for larger companies. 
It reduces disclosure requirements but maintains standards for measurement. Small
companies may choose either to apply the FRSSE in full or to comply with the full
range of separate standards.
The Companies Act 2006 permits small and medium-sized companies to ﬁle ‘abbre-
viated’ ﬁnancial statements with the Registrar of Companies. The word ‘abbreviated’
can be explained as ‘cutting down the detail’ but views have been expressed that this
has gone too far and that abbreviated ﬁnancial statements do not provide useful infor-
mation about small companies. It allows them, for example, to maintain conﬁdentiality
of proﬁt margins. During discussions on law reform leading to the Companies Act
2006, the White Paper of 200521 acknowledged this concern but noted that the option
was popular with many companies. It said that the Government intended to retain the
option for abbreviated ﬁnancial statements but would require small and medium-
sized companies to disclose revenue (turnover).
7.9.2
IFRS for SMEs and the future of UK GAAP
After many years of discussion the IASB issued a shortened form of accounting 
standards called International Financial Reporting Standards for Small and Medium-sized
Entities (IFRS for SMEs).22
It maintains measurement principles that are consistent with the full IFRS but is 
a considerably shorter document. It achieves this in several ways. Firstly, topics not
relevant to SMEs are omitted. Secondly, where the full IFRSs allow accounting policy
choices, the IFRS for SMEs speciﬁes one choice only and selects the least difﬁcult 
one. Thirdly, while the measurement principles are consistent with full IFRS, the SME 
version simpliﬁes the principles for recognising and measuring assets, liabilities,
income and expenses. Fourthly, the required disclosures are signiﬁcantly reduced in
number. Finally, the standard has been written in clear language that can be translated
relatively easily.
After 2005 there was a continuing need for UK GAAP where standards were main-
tained by the UK ASB for those companies that do not use the full IFRS. The need for
continuing UK GAAP seems less clear now there exists the IFRS for SMEs. However
it is necessary for national regulators to decide whether their country will adopt the
IFRS for SMEs.

Chapter 7 Published financial statements
189
Accordingly the UK ASB issued a discussion paper in 2009 asking whether, and
how soon, UK SMEs could move to the IFRS for SMEs. The tentative target was 2012
but the proposals met some signiﬁcant objections. This in turn led to a further consultation
via an exposure draft, FRED 48, issued in January 2012 for comment, recommended:
(a) replacing all current ﬁnancial reporting standards (FRS and SSAPs) in the UK and
Republic of Ireland with a single FRS;
(b) introducing a reduced disclosure framework for the ﬁnancial reporting of certain
qualifying entities see now FRS 101 (November 2012) and
(c) retaining the FRSSE with a further consultation on how to update it following the
European Commission proposals for the future of ﬁnancial reporting for small and
micro companies.
These recommendations are implemented in FRS 100, 101 and 102, issued in
November 2012 and in 2013.23
7.10 Beyond the annual report
The annual report is a regulated base of information on which a reporting cycle is
built. The cycle begins when the company makes its ﬁrst announcement of the results
of the ﬁnancial year. This announcement is made in a manner dictated by the
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FSA.
The cycle continues with reports being issued in the period between annual reports.
These are called ‘interim reports’. The FSA requires half-yearly reports. The regulators
of the US stock exchanges require quarterly reports. All UK listed companies provide
half-yearly reports and some voluntarily provide quarterly reports.
Other questions arising beyond the annual report are:
l What help exists for small and medium-sized companies to reduce the burden of
communication for regulatory purposes?
l How do larger companies avoid information overload for their shareholders?
l Can users have conﬁdence in additional information provided beyond the annual
report?
l What developments is the UK government currently implementing or planning?
This section outlines developments on these issues.
7.10.1
Announcing the annual report
For many years the preliminary announcement was the ﬁrst external communication
of the ﬁnancial performance and position of a company in relation to the ﬁnancial year
most recently completed. When the year-end results and half-yearly results were ready
for publication, a preliminary announcement of key information was made in a manner
set out by the Stock Exchange, consistent with the aim of fair and equal access for all
investors. The preliminary announcement was usually accompanied by a press release,
giving the information to the media, and by meetings with professional investors and
brokers’ analysts at which key personnel in the company (usually the chairman, chief
executive and ﬁnance director) would make speeches and answer questions.
This traditional route has been modiﬁed since 2007 by the Disclosure and
Transparency Rules (DTR) of the Financial Services Authority. The DTR set out the
methods by which a company may announce that its annual report is available.
Companies must make public their annual report within four months of the ﬁnancial
year end. A company cannot make an announcement until the full text of the annual
report is available on the company’s website.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
190
Companies can announce their results in one of two ways. Either:
1. Disseminate the full annual report in unedited full text.
or
2. Disseminate ‘components only’ in unedited full text by providing those parts of the
annual report that would be available in a half-yearly interim report.
In both cases there needs to be a link to the website where the full annual report can
be found. ‘Unedited full text’ does not include pdf format.
There is no requirement for making a preliminary announcement, although the FSA
expects that many companies will wish to continue this practice. For those who wish
to do so, there is a deﬁned process for making the preliminary announcement. If it is
audited then there should be a link to the full annual report on the website. If it is
unaudited there will be a dissemination announcement when the full audited report
is published.
7.10.2
Periodic reporting within the financial year
The Transparency Directive of the European Union seeks to enhance transparency in
EU capital markets through a common framework which includes periodic ﬁnancial
reports.
Listed UK companies must produce two interim management statements (IMS)
each ﬁnancial year, with one in each six-month period, ten weeks after the beginning
and six months before the end of the relevant six-month period. The IMS must provide
information on any material events and transactions and their impact on the ﬁnancial
position of the company, along with a general description of the company’s ﬁnancial
position and performance. IMS must contain up-to-date information from the begin-
ning of the period until the date of publication.

Activity 7.7
Chapter 7 Published financial statements
191
Half-yearly reports must be produced within two months of the end of the ﬁrst six
months of the ﬁnancial year. Half-yearly reports have previously been called ‘interim
reports’. The international accounting standard IAS 3424 provides guidance on interim
reporting which is acceptable to the FSA for the purpose of half-yearly reporting.
One interesting accounting question is how to measure the results of half a year.
One view is that the results of half a year should represent the actual events of that
half-year. This is called the ‘discrete’ method. A different view is that the result for six
months should represent half of the results of the full year. This is called the ‘integral’
method. Why does this make a difference? Imagine a company which manufactures
and sells ﬁreworks. The costs will fall evenly through the year but most of the sales
will arise in the months leading to 5 November. Using the discrete method, the ﬁrst
six months of the calendar year will show low proﬁts or perhaps losses. The second
six months will show relatively high proﬁts. Using the integral method each half-year
will show the same proﬁt at 50% of the total ﬁgure of the year.
IAS 34 requires the discrete method to be used as far as possible. Some expense
items, such as taxation, may have to be spread evenly over the year.
In matters of disclosure the IASB recommends that the interim report should
include a balance sheet, income statement, statement of changes in equity and cash
ﬂow, together with explanatory notes and comments.
Obtain the half-yearly report and the annual report of a major listed company. Compare 
the half-yearly report with the annual report. What are the information items in the half-
yearly report? How do they compare with the full year in the annual report? What
statements of accounting policy are made in the half-yearly report?
7.10.3
Prospectus
When a major company wants to raise signiﬁcant amounts of ﬁnance through selling
shares on the Stock Market, it issues a prospectus. The contents of the prospectus are
regulated by the UK Listing Authority, backed up on some items by the Companies
Act 2006. The document is often several hundred pages in length and quite formidable
in appearance. It contains more detail than the annual report. The prospectus is a 
public document but there is no central archive of prospectuses so it is useful in
research projects to retain copies as they appear. Some business libraries retain copies.
7.10.4
Avoiding information overload
Even the very largest companies may take advantage of the rule which allows them to
publish summary ﬁnancial statements. These are usually very much shorter than the
full annual report and are offered to shareholders as an alternative to the full report.
There is a short form of the balance sheet, proﬁt and loss account and cash ﬂow state-
ment, no notes to the accounts but usually an accompanying commentary by the 
company directors. Shareholders are reminded of the existence of the full report and
invited to ask for a copy if desired.
7.10.5
Additional non-GAAP measures
A survey undertaken by the accountancy ﬁrm Deloitte25 showed widespread use in
2010 and 2011 of additional non-GAAP measures of performance reported on the face
of the income statement. Such additional measures are encouraged by IAS 1 when
they are relevant to an understanding of the ﬁnancial performance of the company.
One criticism made by Deloitte is that some of the companies do not deﬁne their non-
GAAP measures so that it is difﬁcult for readers to understand why they are being

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
192
used. The most common adjustments observed are the exclusion of the costs of funda-
mental reorganisation from non-GAAP performance measures. Other exclusions 
covered impairment, amortisation of intangibles and asset disposal and items relating
to changes in value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. A common form of presentation
observed was the use of the word ‘exceptional’ to describe such costs, locating them
in a separate column on the income statement or in a separate box that can be removed
from the performance measures. In the Real World case study at the start of this 
chapter you can see additional non-GAAP measures illustrated.
Two different views may be taken of this ﬂexible approach. One is that it allows a
company to provide a better understanding of its ﬁnancial performance. The other is
that it allows a company to confuse investors by presenting performance in a way that
favours the company and distracts the reader from the overall picture.
7.10.6
‘Pro forma’ financial statements
‘Pro forma’ ﬁnancial statements represent a recent development in company reporting
that is causing some confusion among users of accounting information, and some con-
cern among the regulators. According to the dictionary, the phrase ‘pro forma’ means
‘as a matter of form’. The underlying accounting meaning is ‘outside the normal
reporting regulations’. It usually involves selective editing from a larger body of infor-
mation that has been prepared under accounting rules, or the inclusion of some items
that would not be permitted under the accounting standards applied. The risk is that
the selective information may not, by itself, represent a true and fair view. This does
not necessarily mean that the information is bad or misleading, but it does mean that
the investor is deprived of the full protection of regulation. As an example, a company
was formed by a demerger from a larger group, changing the capital structure and
changing the accounting year-end. To preserve comparability the company adjusted
the ﬁgures for earlier years to be presented on a basis consistent with more recent
years. This company also deﬁned its own ‘benchmark’ proﬁt measures which are not
speciﬁed in accounting standards. It claimed the pro forma and benchmark infor-
mation helps readers better to understand the performance of the group.
7.10.7
Electronic publication of documents
One conclusion of the Company Law Review, leading to the Companies Act 2006, 
was that the law allows ﬁnancial reporting to be a slow process that could be speeded
up by use of electronic delivery. The Companies Act now conﬁrms that a document
supplied in electronic form will be validly delivered if that form has been agreed 
by the intended recipient (or the intended recipient had not replied when asked for a
preference). However, shareholders and others having a right to receive information
are able to ask for a paper copy of a document.
7.11 Summary
l Company law in the UK includes sections that implement EU Directives. This means
that UK company accounting has for many years been harmonised with company
accounting in other member states of the EU, but mainly in matters of disclosure.
Member states have continued to require or permit different measurement practices.
l From 2005 listed groups of companies in EU member states have been required to
follow the IASB system of reporting. Individual companies and unlisted groups
have the choice of the IASB system or UK company law and UK ASB standards.

Chapter 7 Published financial statements
193
l The primary ﬁnancial statements under both systems include a statement of ﬁnan-
cial position, income statement (proﬁt and loss account) and statement of cash
ﬂows. Under the IASB system a statement of changes in equity is required. Under
the UK ASB standards a statement of recognised gains and losses is required and a
note of movements on reserves.
l Formats set out the content and layout of ﬁnancial statements. Under UK company
law there are detailed formats required for the balance sheet and proﬁt and loss
account. The IASB system is more ﬂexible on layout but provides lists of essential items.
l A group of companies consists of a parent and subsidiaries. All must be included.
A subsidiary is deﬁned by the control exercised by the parent. Control is com-
monly evidenced by the parent holding more than half of the voting power in 
the subsidiary. Control may be evidenced in other kinds of agreements relating to
shareholdings or to the board of directors.
l A consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position contains the total assets and liab-
ilities of the group of companies, after eliminating any amounts receivable and
payable between group companies.
l A consolidated income statement (proﬁt and loss account) contains the total 
revenues and expenses of the group of companies, after eliminating any trans-
actions and proﬁts made between group companies.
l A consolidated statement of cash ﬂows contains the total cash ﬂows of the group of
companies, after eliminating any cash ﬂows between group companies.
l Goodwill arising on acquisition is calculated by comparing the fair value of the 
payment for the subsidiary with the fair value of net assets acquired. It represents
future economic beneﬁts arising from assets that are not capable of being individu-
ally identiﬁed and separately recognised.
l Goodwill is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet and is tested annually for
impairment.
l Beyond the annual report there is a range of corporate communications – often
found most readily by visiting a company’s website.
l For small companies special disclosure rules apply to reduce the burden of providing
information.

Problem solving and evaluation
C7.1 [S]
A listed company is of the view that shareholders might welcome a statement of highlights and
supplementary information as a leaflet to be inserted in the annual report. Give advice on the
principles to be followed in making such information useful to users.
Activities for study groups
Continuing to use the annual reports of companies which you obtained for Chapters 1 and 4,
find the financial statements and the notes to the accounts.
1 Compare the financial statements with the formats and presentations shown in this chapter,
and note any differences which you observe. Look at the notes to the accounts for items

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
196
which are required by the regulations but are included in the notes rather than the main finan-
cial statements.
2 Find the Operating and Financial Review (sometimes named the Business Review or the
finance director’s review) and compare the cash flow discussion there with the FRS 1 pre-
sentation. Form a view on how readily the discussion may be related to the financial statement.
3 In your group, take the list of qualitative characteristics listed at section 4.2 and use the finan-
cial statements as a means of illustrating how the company has met those characteristics. 
If you have a set of different annual reports, each member of the group should take the 
role of a finance director pointing out the qualitative characteristics of their own company’s
financial statements. The group together should then decide on a ranking with a view to
nominating one of the annual reports for an award of ‘Communicator of the Year’.

Supplement to Chapter 7.2
Balance sheet format 1, as prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
The details of the Companies Act 2006 are implemented in regulations called Statu-
tory Instruments (SI). SI 2008/410 The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 sets out formats that should be used by UK
companies that are not reporting under IFRS. The formats are speciﬁed as lists of 
headings. The list attaches letters A to K to the main headings and uses roman numerals
for subheadings of items which are important but slightly less important than the
main headings. The headings labelled by letters A to K and the subheadings labelled
by roman numerals must be shown in the main body of the balance sheet. There are
further lists of detailed items which must be reported but which may be contained in
additional pages of notes to the balance sheet. These lists are given arabic numerals 
to identify them. There is a general rule that where an item under any heading is not
relevant to the company, or is of zero amount, it need not be disclosed. So if a com-
pany does not mention one of the items in the format, it has to be presumed that the
particular item is not relevant to that company.

Supplement to Chapter 7.3
Information to be presented on the face of 
the Income Statement as required by IAS 1
The IASB sets out the contents of the full statement of comprehensive income and then explains
how it may be separated into an income statement and a statement of other comprehensive income.
As a minimum, the statement of comprehensive income must include line items that
present the following amounts for the period:1
(a) revenue;
(b) gains and losses arising from the derecognition of ﬁnancial assets measured at
amortised cost;
(c) ﬁnance costs;
(d) share of the proﬁt or loss of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the
equity method;
(e) if a ﬁnancial asset is reclassiﬁed so that it is measured at fair value, any gain or loss
arising from a difference between the previous carrying amount and its fair value
at the reclassiﬁcation date (as deﬁned in IFRS 9);
(f) tax expense;
(g) a single amount comprising the total of:
1. the post-tax proﬁt or loss of discontinued operations; and
2. the post-tax gain or loss recognised on the measurement to fair value less costs
to sell or on the disposal of the assets or disposal group(s) constituting the dis-
continued operation;
(h) proﬁt or loss;
(i)
each component of other comprehensive income classiﬁed by nature (excluding
amounts in (h));
(j)
share of the other comprehensive income of associates and joint ventures accounted
for using the equity method; and
(k) total comprehensive income.
An entity must disclose the following items in the statement of comprehensive income
as allocations for the period:2
(a) proﬁt or loss for the period attributable to:
i. non-controlling interests, and
ii. owners of the parent.
(b) total comprehensive income for the period attributable to:
i. non-controlling interests, and
ii. owners of the parent.
If the entity chooses to present a separate income statement then this must include the line
items (a) to (f) from the ﬁrst list above and the disclosures in paragraph (a)(i) and (ii) of
the allocations for the period between non-controlling interests and owners of the parent.3
An entity must present additional line items, headings and subtotals in the statement
of comprehensive income and the separate income statement (if presented), when such
presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity’s ﬁnancial performance.4

REAL WORLD CASE
ITV is the largest commercial television network in the
UK. It operates a family of channels including ITV1 and
delivers content across multiple platforms. Read the
following extracts from the Accounting Policies section 
of the annual report.
Keeping it simple . . .
The following section shows the physical assets used by the
Group to generate revenues and profits. These assets include
office buildings and studios, as well as equipment used in
broadcast transmissions, programme production and support
activities.
The cost of these assets is the amount initially paid for them. A depreciation expense is charged to the
income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and the reduced value of the asset over time. Depreciation
is calculated by estimating the number of years the Group expects the asset to be used (useful economic
life). If there has been a technological change or decline in business performance the Directors review the
value of assets to ensure they have not fallen below their depreciated value. If an asset’s value falls below
its depreciated value an additional one-off impairment change is made against profit.
This section also explains the accounting policies followed by ITV and the specific estimates made in
arriving at the net book value of these assets.
Accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that were revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004, 
the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount less
depreciation up to the date of transition.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less estimated residual
value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The annual depreciation charge is sensitive
to the estimated useful life of each asset and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The major
categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows:
Asset class
Depreciation policy
Freehold land
Not depreciated
Freehold buildings
Up to 60 years
Leaseholder properties
Shorter of residual lease term or 60 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of residual lease term or estimated useful life
Vehicles, equipment and fittings1
3 to 20 years
1 Equipment includes studio production and technology assets.

8.1 Introduction
If you have progressed through Chapters 1 to 7 you are now familiar with the account-
ing equation and the analysis of transactions or events using that equation. You know
what is meant by the terms asset, liability, revenue, expense and ownership interest.
You are aware of the structure of the primary ﬁnancial statements and the way in
which they seek to provide information which is relevant and reliable.
This chapter starts a new phase of the text which will help you to develop a critical
awareness of some of the component items in the ﬁnancial statements. Chapters 8 to
12 progress through the main sections of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet). Inevitably, they also cover relevant aspects of the income statement (proﬁt and
loss account) and the statement of cash ﬂows because transactions involving the state-
ment of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) will sometimes have an effect in the other
ﬁnancial statements.
It is important at this stage not to become so enthusiastic for the intricacies of
accounting procedures as to lose sight of the importance of user needs, which were set
out in Chapter 1. That chapter set out, in section 1.2, the structure of most conceptual
frameworks, which provides a sequence for each of Chapters 8 to 12, as follows:
l What are the principles for deﬁning and recognising these items?
l What are the information needs of users in respect of the particular items?
l What information is currently provided by companies to meet these needs?
l Does the information show the desirable qualitative characteristics of ﬁnancial
statements?
l What are the principles for measuring, and processes for recording, these items?
That analysis is applied to non-current (ﬁxed) assets in this chapter.

Chapter 8 Non-current (fixed) assets
205
8.2 Definitions
The following deﬁnition of an asset was provided in Chapter 2.
Definition
An asset is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from which
future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.1
The following deﬁnitions explain the nature of tangible and non-tangible non-
current assets. The word ‘tangible’ means ‘able to be touched’. So ‘intangible’ means
‘not able to be touched’.
Definitions
A non-current asset is any asset that does not meet the definition of a current asset.2
Non-current assets include tangible, intangible and financial assets of a long-term nature.
These are also described as fixed assets.3
Tangible non-current (fixed) assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are assets
that have physical substance and are held for use in the production or supply of goods or
services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes and an expected to be used
during more than one period.4
An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance.5
These deﬁnitions are taken from different sources because the deﬁnitions have been
developed and discussed at different times for different purposes. The IASB and the
UK ASB have both spent many years in discussion over the subjects of accounting for
tangible and intangible non-current assets because these are complex matters.
8.2.1
Examples of non-current (fixed) assets
The following is a sample of the non-current (ﬁxed) assets found in a company’s state-
ment of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet).
Tangible non-current (fixed) assets
Companies following the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will 
typically use a general heading of ‘Property, plant and equipment’. This general head-
ing might include:
l Land and buildings (property) owned by the entity
l Buildings leased by the entity
l Plant and equipment (owned or leased)
l Vehicles (owned or leased)
l Ofﬁce equipment
l Assets under construction
l Telecommunications network
l Airport runways
l Water pipes and sewers
l Oil and mineral reserves.
Definition6
Property, plant and equipment includes intangible items that:
(a)
are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others,
or for administrative purposes; and
(b)
are expected to be used during more than one period.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
206
Intangible non-current (fixed) assets
l Newspaper titles and publishing rights
l Patents
l Trade marks
l Goodwill purchased
l Brand names purchased.
Investments
l Long-term investments in subsidiary companies
l Long-term investments in other companies.
That sample was taken from only 10 annual reports of leading companies. Looking at
more companies would soon extend the list considerably. The potential variety and the
likelihood of encountering something new is one reason why deﬁnitions are essential.
8.2.2
Cost of a non-current (fixed) asset
There is one issue which is not as straightforward as it seems. That is the question of
measuring the cost of a non-current (ﬁxed) asset. When a toffee manufacturer buys a
new toffee-shaping machine, the purchase price will be known from the supplier’s
invoice and the manufacturer’s catalogue, but should the costs of delivery and instal-
lation be added to the amount recorded as the asset cost? When an insurance company
buys a new head ofﬁce, the purchase price will be shown in the contract, but should
the legal costs be added to the amount recorded as the asset cost? When a new head
ofﬁce building is under development and interest is being paid on the funds borrowed
to ﬁnance the development, should the interest paid on the borrowed funds be added
to the cost of the development as part of the asset value?
The answer in all three cases is ‘yes’, although the third example causes greatest dis-
cussion and debate. The general principle is that the cost of a non-current (ﬁxed) asset
is the purchase price or the amount spent on its production together with any other
expenditure incurred in bringing the non-current (ﬁxed) asset to working condition
for its intended use at its intended location.
Definition
The cost of a non-current (fixed) asset is the purchase price or the amount spent on its
production together with any costs directly attributable to bringing the non-current (fixed)
asset to working condition for its intended use at its intended location.
8.2.3
Repairs and improvements
There are sometimes problems in deciding whether a payment for a repair to a non-
current (ﬁxed) asset should be treated as an expense of the business or an asset. The
key lies in the words of the deﬁnition of an asset and the phrase future economic beneﬁts.
If the payment relates to some act which merely preserves the existing life of the asset
and the existing expectations of beneﬁt from the asset, then the payment is treated as
a repair and reported as an expense. The asset of cash decreases and there is a
decrease in the ownership interest caused by the expense.
If the payment relates to some act which signiﬁcantly extends the useful life of 
the asset, or increases the future economic beneﬁt expected from the asset, then the
payment is treated as an improvement and reported as an asset. It may be reported 
as a separate asset but, more usually, the amount will be added to the cost or value
recorded for the asset which has been improved. The asset of cash decreases and is
replaced by an asset of improvements. There is no effect on the ownership interest.
The following are examples of improvements and repairs.

Activity 8.1
Chapter 8 Non-current (fixed) assets
207
Improvements
l Extensions to a building which increase the operating capacity of the business.
l A new roof which gives a building an extra ten years of life.
l A new engine for a delivery van which is more powerful than the existing engine
and allows faster delivery in hilly districts.
l Renewing the ﬁttings and interior decoration of a hotel to attract international 
visitors instead of the traditional local customers.
Repairs
l A new roof, required because of storm damage, which will keep the building
weatherproof for the remainder of its estimated life.
l A new engine for a delivery van which replaces an existing damaged engine.
l Redecorating inside a building to preserve the existing standards of cleanliness and
appearance.
Imagine you are the owner of a big hotel in the centre of town. Make a list of the items
you would expect to include in your business statement of financial position (balance
sheet) as non-current (fixed) assets. Make a list of the types of repair which would be
classed as ‘improvements’. Use the definition of a non-current (fixed) asset to show that
your list includes items which are correctly classified.
8.3 Recognition
This section outlines the recognition issues faced in reporting non-current assets in the
separate categories of tangible assets, intangible assets and investment assets.
8.3.1
Tangible non-current (fixed) assets
Tangible non-current (ﬁxed) assets are those items which can be touched, seen or heard
and meet the conditions set out in the deﬁnition of a non-current (ﬁxed) asset. Recog-
nition by reporting in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) presents no
problem where the future beneﬁt can be identiﬁed and the cost of the asset can be 
measured. (Look back to section 2.5 for an explanation of recognition.) The evidence of
cost is usually a purchase invoice. Some tangible non-current (ﬁxed) assets are recorded
at a valuation made subsequent to the purchase. Revaluations are discussed in Chapter 12.
As the list in the previous section indicates, there is considerable variety in tangible
non-current (ﬁxed) assets. The common feature is that they all have a limited life
expectancy. They may wear out, be used up, go out of fashion, break down or be sold
for scrap. Whatever the reason, the effect is the same and is called depreciation. Users
have many questions to ask about tangible non-current (ﬁxed) assets, such as:
l What kinds of tangible ﬁxed assets are in use?
l How old are they?
l How has the company measured the depreciation?
l Where is the depreciation recorded?
Answering those questions will take up most of the remainder of this chapter.
8.3.2
Intangible non-current (fixed) assets
An intangible non-current (ﬁxed) asset is an item which meets the deﬁnition of a non-
current (ﬁxed) asset but has no physical substance. It cannot be touched, seen or heard.

Activity 8.2
Part 3 Recognition in financial statements

The evidence of its existence is the beneﬁt ﬂowing from it. For many years, items such
as patents, trademarks and licences to manufacture products have been bought and
sold between companies. The purchase has been recorded as a non-current (ﬁxed)
asset and depreciated over the estimated life of the patent, trademark or licence. The
estimated life is decided by law (for patents and trademarks) or by legal contract (for
licences). The depreciation of intangible non-current (ﬁxed) assets is usually referred
to as amortisation (in which you may recognise the French word mort meaning death).
The intangible non-current (ﬁxed) asset which has attracted most accounting-
related comment in recent years has been the brand name of a company’s product.
When a company works over many years to develop the reputation of its product, that
reputation creates an expected future beneﬁt for the company and meets the deﬁnition
of an asset as set out in Chapter 2. However, the generally held view is that it should
not be recognised in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) because it 
fails the recognition test of Chapter 2. The conventional argument is that there is no
measurable cost of the reputation gained by the brand name and the value cannot be
measured with reliability.
That is the generally held view which was challenged in the mid-1980s by a number
of leading companies. Some had bought other companies which had developed brand
names. The new owners argued that they were buying the other company purely
because of the quality of the brand name and they wanted to show that brand name in
the new statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). They had a reasonable argument
because they had paid a price in the market and could show the cost of the brand name
acquired. Other companies who had developed their own brand names did not want
to be left behind and so paid expert valuers to calculate a value for their home-grown
brands. A new professional specialism of brand valuation gained prominence and the
experts claimed they could measure the value of a home-grown brand with reliability.
The companies which reported brand names in the statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet) argued that the brand had a long life and did not require amortisation.
This argument gave them the advantage of expanding the statement of ﬁnancial pos-
ition (balance sheet) without the disadvantage of amortisation appearing in the income
statement (proﬁt and loss account).
The IASB has issued a standard, IAS 38, covering accounting for intangible assets.
Internally generated brand names must not be recognised as intangible assets. This
rule applies to similar assets such as publishing titles, customer lists, or newspaper
titles. Purchased brand names or trademarks or patents may be reported in a state-
ment of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) if they meet the conditions for recognition.
Recognition requires that it is probable that the expected economic beneﬁt will ﬂow to
the entity, and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
If the intangible asset has a ﬁnite life it must be amortised over its useful life. The
method of amortisation must reﬂect the pattern of use of the asset.
A company which has manufactured a well-known brand of brown bread for many years
has decided that the brand name is so well known that it should appear in the statement
of financial position (balance sheet). Write down two arguments in favour of this, to be
made by the company’s finance director, and two arguments against, which will appear 
in a newspaper article.
8.3.3
Investments
Investments exist in many different forms but the essential feature is an ability to gener-
ate future economic beneﬁts so that the wealth of the owner increases. This increase in
wealth may arise because the value of the investment increases, or may arise because
the investment creates income for the owner in the form of a distribution such as interest

Activity 8.3
Chapter 8 Non-current (fixed) assets
209
paid or dividends. Companies may hold investments for a variety of reasons. A non-
current (ﬁxed asset) investment is one which is held for long-term purposes, such as
shares in another company which has close trading links with the investing company.
The number of shares held may be such as to give direct control of the investment
or may be of a lesser amount which indicates a long-term relationship, without direct
control, in a similar line of business.
Non-current (ﬁxed) asset investments may be held so that resources are available 
to meet a long-term obligation, such as the payment of pensions. Such non-current
(ﬁxed) assets are normally found in the statements of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheets) of insurance companies or pension funds, rather than in the balance sheet of
the company employing staff.
The features which make investments different as non-current (ﬁxed) assets are the
importance of the increase in value of the investment itself and the fact that they are
not used in the production or service process. Both features require a different kind of
accounting treatment from that given to other non-current (ﬁxed) assets. Those special
treatments are advanced accounting matters and will not be dealt with in any detail in
this text. What you should look for in accounts is the existence of non-current (ﬁxed)
asset investments and the information provided about them. The questions users will
ask are: ‘How well is this investment keeping up its value?’ and ‘How important is the
income from this investment to the overall proﬁt of the company?’
8.4 Users’ needs for information
Before you read this section, make a list of the information about non-current (fixed)
assets which would be useful to you if you wished to learn more about a specific
company. Then read the section and compare it with your list. How far-thinking are 
you in respect of accounting information?
Analysts who write reports for professional and private investors have a particular
interest in the non-current (ﬁxed) assets because these are the base from which proﬁts
are generated. They want to know what types of assets are held, how old they are and
what plans the company has for future investment in non-current (ﬁxed) assets.
The analysts also want to know about the impact of the depreciation charge on the
proﬁt of the year. They are aware that detailed aspects of calculations of depreciation
may vary from one year to the next and this may affect the comparability of the proﬁt
amounts.
To estimate the remaining life of the assets, analysts compare the accumulated depre-
ciation with the total cost (or value) of the non-current (ﬁxed) assets. If the accumulated
depreciation is relatively low, then the non-current (ﬁxed) assets are relatively new.
Other companies in the industry will be used for comparison. The analysts also com-
pare the depreciation charge for the year with the total cost (or value) of the assets and
expect to see a similar relationship from one year to the next. A sudden change will
cause them to ask more questions about a change in the basis of calculation.
8.5 Information provided in the financial statements
In Chapter 7 the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of Safe and Sure plc
was presented. The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) showed a single 
line of information on property, plant and equipment. This section shows how that

It is clear from the extensive nature of note 2 to the statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet) that property, plant and equipment assets are regarded as important
by those who regulate the information. All companies present a detailed note of this
kind because the information is required by IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment.
8.5.3
Statement of accounting policy
In addition the company is required, by the accounting standard IAS 1, Presentation of
Financial Statements, to disclose its signiﬁcant accounting policies. For this company
the wording of the accounting policy statement is as follows:
Freehold and leasehold property
Freehold and leasehold land and buildings are stated either at cost (Security and Cleaning) or
at their revalued amounts less depreciation (Disposal and Recycling). Full revaluations are
made at ﬁve-year intervals with interim valuations in the intervening years, the most recent
full revaluation being in year 5.
Provision for depreciation of freehold land and buildings is made at the annual rate of 1%
of cost or the revalued amounts. Leasehold land and buildings are amortised in equal annual
instalments over the periods of the leases subject to a minimum annual provision of 1% of
cost or the revalued amounts. When properties are sold the difference between sales proceeds
and net book value is dealt with in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account).
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Provision for depreciation is made
mainly in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
4 to 5 years
vehicles
5 to 10 years
plant, machinery and equipment
8.5.4
Operating and financial review
There is also a comment in the ﬁnance director’s report, as a contribution to the 
operating and ﬁnancial review:
Capital expenditure
The major items of capital expenditure are vehicles, equipment used on customers’ premises
and ofﬁce equipment, particularly computers. Disposals during the year were mainly of 
vehicles being replaced on a rolling programme.

8.6 Usefulness of published information
Here is David Wilson to explain how useful he sees the information provided by com-
panies about their tangible non-current (ﬁxed) assets. If you look back to Chapter 4
you will see that he was about to visit the company and had made a preliminary list
of questions. He has now made the visit and has a better understanding of what is

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
212
reported in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). He talks to Leona in a
break at a workout session.
DAVID: I told you that in making my review before visiting the company I looked closely at
the type of tangible non-current (fixed) assets held and the estimated useful life. I also
checked that the depreciation period and method of calculation had not changed from 
previous years.
As I was making a site visit I took the opportunity to look at the various non-current
(fixed) assets. This is a group of companies, expanding by acquisition of other companies,
and each acquisition brings in more land and buildings. Some of these assets are recorded
at valuation rather than original cost. The company has to review the valuation on a regular
basis. That is quite a common practice and I have confidence in the firm of valuers used.
Plant and equipment has an aggregate depreciation of £70.2m which is 62% of the cost
of the assets at £112.8m. It seems to me that must be saying that the plant and equipment
is more than halfway through its estimated life. The finance director wasn’t too enthusiastic
about this interpretation. He pointed out that when another company is acquired the non-
current (fixed) assets may be quite old and have to be brought into the group statement of
financial position, but once they are in group control there is a strict policy of evaluation and
replacement. He views the depreciation policy as being at the prudent end of the spectrum,
so the realistic life remaining might be marginally over half, but discretion and the fast-moving
nature of the industry requires an element of caution. He called in the plant manager who
showed me the replacement schedules for plant and equipment for the next three years. It
certainly reassured me that risk of obsolescence is probably not a serious worry. I also met
the vehicle fleet supervisor who showed me similar replacement schedules for the vehicles.
I saw how the vehicle fleet is managed so that every vehicle is idle for the minimum time.
Each vehicle is assigned to a group of cleaning operatives, whose shifts are scheduled so
that the vehicle’s use is maximised. Plant and equipment are the responsibility of area 
managers who have to look after security, maintenance and efficiency of usage. I thought
it was all really quite impressive.
The depreciation charge for the plant and equipment in Year 7 is £13.5m which is 12% of
the cost of £112.8m and suggests an estimated life of just over eight years is being applied.
That is within the range of five to ten years stated as the company’s accounting policy. 
I think the wording ‘five to ten years’ is too vague. Using five years would double the 
depreciation charge compared with ten. I tried to pin down the finance director so that I can
get a good figure for my forecast but all he would say was that there is no reason to suppose
there are any unusual features in the amount in the accounts. The depreciation charge for
vehicles is £19.2m which is 16% of the cost of £118.6m. That suggests an estimated life of
just over six years is being applied. I asked the finance director how that squared with the
accounting policy statement of estimated useful lives of four to five years for vehicles. 
He did seem to sigh a little at that point but was quite patient in explaining that there 
are some fully depreciated vehicles still in use (because they are quite prudent in their 
estimates of depreciation) and so the depreciation charge is not the 20% to 25% I was
looking for. I’ll need to think about that one but I might move my estimate for next year
closer to 20%.
You asked me how this company’s information measures up to the qualitative charac-
teristics (set out in Chapter 4). Relevance I would rate highly, because there is plenty of
information in the notes which I can use to ask questions about the effective use of non-
current (fixed) assets and the impact on income statement (profit and loss account) through
the depreciation charge. Faithful representation and neutrality are qualities I leave to the
auditors. Prudence is something which seems to come out strongly in conversation with
the finance director. The detailed schedule of assets which I saw suggests that complete-
ness is not a problem. Comparability is fine because there are amounts for the previous
year and the standard format allows me to make comparison with other companies in the
industry. Understandability is perhaps more of a problem than I thought. Those fully depre-
ciated assets caught me out.

LEONA: Well, I have now heard you admit that there is some value in having auditors. Shall
I tell you how much you have missed? You could have asked more searching questions
about the way in which they measure the cost of plant and equipment. Does it include
delivery charges and installation costs? You could have asked whether a technical expert
inside the company estimates and reviews the asset lives used, or whether the finance
director makes a guess. Did you ask whether they are perhaps verging on being over-prudent
so that surprises come later when the depreciation charge is less than expected? You could
have asked how the interim valuations are carried out. These are all questions we ask as
auditors so that you may treat the information as being reliable and a faithful representation.
Hopefully you now have a feeling for the information provided by companies 
on tangible non-current (ﬁxed) assets and how it is used by the professional investor.
The nature and recording of depreciation is now explained.
8.7 Depreciation: an explanation of its nature
Before you read this section, write down what you think ‘depreciation’ means. Then read
the section and compare it with your initial views. Depreciation is a very subjective matter
and there are different views of its purpose, so your answer may be interesting even if it
does not match the text. You should consult your lecturer, tutor or other expert in the
area to understand why your perceptions may be different.
Definitions7
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its
useful life.
The depreciable amount is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for 
cost, less its residual value. 
Residual value is the estimated amount that an entity would currently obtain from
disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated cost of disposal, if the asset were
already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.
The asset may be an item of plant or equipment which is wearing out through being
used. It may be a payment made by a company for the right to become a tenant of a
property. That payment purchases a lease which reduces in value through the passage
of time. The asset may be a computer system which becomes out of date in a very short
space of time because of obsolescence. It may be a machine which produces goods for
which demand falls because of changing market conditions.
The deﬁnition shows that depreciation is a device used in accounting to allocate
(spread) the cost of a non-current (ﬁxed) asset over its useful life. The process of
spreading cost over more than one accounting period is called allocation.
In terms of the accounting equation, the useful life of the non-current (ﬁxed) asset
is being reduced and this will reduce the ownership interest.

As the asset becomes older, the depreciation of one year is added to the depre-
ciation of previous years. This is called the accumulated depreciation or aggregate
depreciation. The accumulated depreciation at the end of any year is equal to the 
accumulated depreciation at the start of the year plus the depreciation charge for 
that year.
Deducting the accumulated depreciation from the original cost leaves the net book
value. The net book value could also be described as the cost remaining as a beneﬁt for
future years.
Showing the effect of depreciation by use of arrows and the accounting equation is
relatively easy. Deciding on the amount of depreciation each year is much more
difﬁcult because there are so many different views of how to calculate the amount of
asset used up in each period.
8.7.1
Calculation of depreciation
Calculation of depreciation requires three pieces of information:
1 the cost of the asset;
2 the estimated useful life; and
3 the estimated residual value.
The total depreciation of the non-current (ﬁxed) asset is equal to the cost of the 
non-current (ﬁxed) asset minus the estimated residual value. The purpose of the depre-
ciation calculation is to spread the total depreciation over the estimated useful life.
The ﬁrst point at which differences of opinion arise is in the estimation of the 
useful life and residual value. These are matters of judgement which vary from one
person to the next.
Unfortunately the differences do not stop at those estimates. There is also no agree-
ment on the arithmetical approach to spreading the total depreciation over the useful
life. Some people are of the opinion that a non-current (ﬁxed) asset is used evenly over
time and that the depreciation should reﬂect the beneﬁt gained from its use. Others
argue that the non-current (ﬁxed) asset declines in value most in the early years and
so the depreciation charge should be greater in earlier years.
8.7.2
Straight-line method
Those who are of the opinion that a non-current (ﬁxed) asset is used evenly over time
apply a method of calculation called straight-line depreciation. The formula is:
To illustrate the use of the formula, take a non-current (ﬁxed) asset which has a cost
of £1,000 and an estimated life of ﬁve years. The estimated residual value is nil. The
calculation of the annual depreciation charge is:
= £200 per annum
The depreciation rate is sometimes expressed as a percentage of the original cost. In
this case the company would state its depreciation policy as follows:
Accounting policy:
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis at a rate of 20% of cost per annum.
£1,000 −nil

Cost −Expected residual value
Expected life

Chapter 8 Non-current (fixed) assets

8.7.3
Reducing-balance method
Those who believe that the asset depreciates most in earlier years would calculate the
depreciation using the formula:
Fixed percentage × Net book value at the start of the year
Take the example of the asset costing £1,000. The ﬁxed percentage applied for the
reducing-balance method might be as high as 50%. The calculations would be as
shown in Table 8.2.
You will see from Table 8.2 that under the reducing-balance method there is always
a small balance remaining. In this example, the rate of 50% is used to bring the net
book value to a relatively small amount. The formula for calculating the exact rate
requires a knowledge of compound interest and may be found at the end of the
The phrase ‘straight-line’ is used because a graph of the net book value of the asset
at the end of each year produces a straight line. Table 8.1 sets out the ﬁve-year 
pattern of depreciation and net book value for the example used above.
Figure 8.1 shows a graph of the net book value at the end of each year. The graph
starts at the cost ﬁgure of £1,000 when the asset is new (Year 0) and reduces by £200
each year until it is zero at the end of Year 5.

Supplement to this chapter. For those whose main interest is in understanding and
interpreting accounts it is not necessary to know the formula, but it is useful to be
aware that a very much higher percentage rate is required on the reducing-balance
method as compared with the straight-line method. As a useful guide, the reducing-
balance rate must be at least twice the rate of the straight-line calculation if the major
part of the asset is to be depreciated over its useful life.

Which method to choose?
The separate recording of asset at cost and accumulated depreciation is accounting
information provided in many countries. The UK practice at a general level is con-
sistent with the IASB standard. Country-speciﬁc factors may lead to differences in
matters of detail such as the choice of depreciation method or the estimated life of 
A graph of the net book value at the end of each year under the reducing-balance
method is shown in Figure 8.2. The steep slope at the start shows that the net book
value declines rapidly in the early part of the asset’s life and then less steeply towards
the end when most of the beneﬁt of the asset has been used up.

Activity 8.6
Chapter 8 Non-current (fixed) assets
217
non-current (ﬁxed) assets. In some countries, the depreciation expense in the account-
ing income statement (proﬁt and loss account) must match that used for the purposes
of calculating taxable proﬁt. This may encourage the use of the reducing-balance
method, giving a higher expense (and so a lower proﬁt) in the early years of the asset’s
life. In the UK there are separate rules in tax law for calculating depreciation, and so
this has no effect on accounting proﬁt.
The choice of depreciation method should be based on the expected pattern of
usage of the asset. If the usage is evenly spread then the straight-line method is appro-
priate. If the usage is heaviest in early years then the reducing-balance method is 
the best representation of the economic activity. In practice, it is found that most UK
companies use straight-line depreciation. In some other countries, particularly those
where tax rules and accounting laws are closely linked, the reducing-balance method
is commonly observed. So it appears that there are different international practices
that may reﬂect different conditions in the respective countries. David and Leona 
discuss the problem.
DAVID: The choice of depreciation method may have a significant impact on reported
profit. Companies that are actively investing in non-current (fixed) assets will do so in the
expectation of increased profits. However, it may take some time for such profits to emerge.
If, in the meantime, there is a relatively high charge to income statement (profit and loss
account) through reducing-balance depreciation, profits may fall in the short term. In con-
trast the use of straight-line depreciation will have a less dramatic impact on reported profit
immediately following the new investment, so the company avoids a dip in profits.
LEONA: I can’t accept that as a valid argument to give to the auditor. I ask the company 
what the pattern of usage is. If the company tells me that the asset produces benefit evenly
over its useful life, I can accept straight-line depreciation. If, on the other hand, I hear that
the asset is more productive in its early years of life, I expect to see reducing-balance
depreciation.
DAVID: Well let me try your social conscience. I came across a case of a UK company that
had been taken over by a German parent company. The UK company had always used
straight-line depreciation and was making small profits each year. The parent company had
always used reducing-balance depreciation and so changed the accounting method of the
UK subsidiary. Small profits turned into large losses and the parent company said that
there would have to be a reduction in the workforce to cut costs. The employee represen-
tatives said that nothing had changed except that the accountants had redefined the game.
They blamed the accountants for the resulting job losses and increased unemployment.
LEONA: My role is confined to giving an opinion on the accounting information. If a particu-
lar accounting process is detrimental to the public interest then it is the job of government
to legislate.
Consider the discussion between David and Leona. Do you share the concern of the
employee representatives as described by David? Do you agree with Leona that the
economic impact of accounting information is not a problem for the auditor? What is 
your view on the social responsibility attached to financial reporting?

Retaining cash in the business
Suppose that the policy of the owner is to take all the available proﬁts as drawings for
personal use. Take a company that has fee income of £120,000 and pays wages and
other costs of £58,000. If the company did not recognise the expense of depreciation

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
218
the owner’s drawings could be as high as £62,000. Suppose now that depreciation 
of non-current (ﬁxed) assets is calculated as £10,000. The net proﬁt after depreciation
becomes £52,000. The owner can still see £62,000 in the bank account but knows
£10,000 of that amount represents using up non-current (ﬁxed) assets. Leaving the
£10,000 in the bank will allow the business to save cash for asset replacement. The
owner should withdraw no more than £52,000.
It is often said that depreciation limits the amount of proﬁts available for cash 
drawings by the owner and encourages saving for asset replacement. However, 
there is nothing to stop the business spending the £10,000 on some purpose other than
replacement of non-current (ﬁxed) assets. We can only say that cash withheld from
shareholders may be used to replace assets at the end of the asset life.
8.8 Reporting non-current (fixed) assets and depreciation in
financial statements
This section moves step by step through the recording process. First, it looks at a situ-
ation of straight-line depreciation with no residual value for the asset. Then it takes in
the additional complication of an estimated residual value.
8.8.1
Straight-line depreciation, no residual value
When a retail company wants new premises, it must either buy a shop or rent one.
Renting is referred to as leasing. When the rent agreement is signed, the tenant may
pay an agreed price for the privilege of having the lease. This is called the initial pay-
ment for the lease. It is paid in addition to the annual rental payment. The initial 
payment to acquire the lease provides a beneﬁt of occupation for the entire period 
of the lease and so is a non-current (ﬁxed) asset. Because the lease has a known life, 
it must be depreciated.
On 1 January Year 2 Electrical Instruments purchased a three-year lease of a 
shop for a payment of £60,000. Using the straight-line method of depreciation the
amount of depreciation each year will be calculated on a straight-line basis as £20,000
(one-third of the cost of the lease). The income statement (proﬁt and loss account) will
report this amount as an expense in each of the three years of the lease. The statement
of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) will show on one line the original cost of £60,000
and, on a second line, the accumulated depreciation to be subtracted at the end of 
each year.
The ﬁnancial statements over the period of three years will show the following
information relating to this lease:

8.8.2
Straight-line depreciation with a residual value
In the case of Electrical Instruments the lease had no residual value. Take now the
example of The Removals Company which commences business on 1 January Year 2
by paying cash for a van costing £60,000. It is estimated to have a useful life of three
years and is estimated to have a residual value of £6,000. On 31 December Year 2 the
owner calculates annual depreciation of the van as £18,000, using the formula:
During each year of operating the van, the company collected £120,000 in cash from
customers and paid £58,000 in cash for drivers’ wages, fuel and other running costs.
These transactions and events may be summarised using the accounting equation
and a spreadsheet similar to that used in Chapter 5 (Table 5.3). In Table 8.3 there is a
spreadsheet for the ﬁrst year of the use of the van by the company. The assets section
of the spreadsheet has three columns, one of which is for cash but two of which are for
the van. The two columns for the van keep a separate record of the original cost and
the accumulated depreciation. The original cost is the positive part of the asset but the
accumulated depreciation is the negative part of the asset. Taking the accumulated
depreciation from the original cost leaves the net book value. That is the amount of
cost not yet amortised which acts as a measure of the beneﬁt remaining in the asset for
the future. In Table 8.4 the information collected together by Table 8.3 is presented in
the form of a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) and an income statement
(proﬁt and loss account).
8.8.3
Continuing to use the non-current (fixed) asset
So far, the accounting entries have related to the ﬁrst year of the business so that there
was no need to ask any questions about the position at the start of the period. To show
the full impact of the progressive depreciation of the asset, the spreadsheet and ﬁnancial

statements are now presented for Year 3. Table 8.5 sets out the spreadsheet and 
Table 8.6 sets out the ﬁnancial statements. It is assumed that for Year 3 the amounts of
cash collected from customers and the amounts paid in cash for running costs are the
same as for Year 2. No further capital is contributed by the owner and no new vans
are acquired.
The ﬁrst line of the spreadsheet in Table 8.5 shows the position at the start of 
the year. The asset columns show the amounts as they were at the end of the previous
year. The ownership interest shows the amount resulting at the end of the previous
year, as seen in the Year 2 statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). The columns
for revenue and expenses are empty at the start of the year, awaiting the transactions
and events of Year 3.
8.8.4
Disposing of the non-current (fixed) asset
During Year 4 the amounts of cash received from customers and cash paid for running
costs are the same as they were in Year 3. Table 8.7 sets out the spreadsheet for the
transactions and events.
Now suppose that the van is sold for £6,000 in cash on the ﬁnal day of December
Year 4. The spreadsheet contained in Table 8.7 requires further attention, the additional
accounting impact of the sale being seen in Table 8.8.
The disposal of the van must be analysed in stages:
1 collecting cash;
2 transferring ownership of the vehicle;
3 removing the vehicle from the accounting records.

When the vehicle is removed from the record, two columns must be reduced to
zero. These are the van at cost column and the accumulated depreciation column. The van
at cost column shows the original cost of £60,000 and the accumulated depreciation
shows the amount of £54,000 which has to be deducted to show the amount of the net
book value. The asset of cash increases by £6,000. In terms of the accounting equation:

Selling for a price which is not equal to the net book value
The previous illustration was based on selling the van for £6,000, an amount equal to
the net book value. Suppose instead it was sold for £9,000. There is a gain on disposal
of £3,000. This gain is reported in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account).

If the amount of the gain or loss on disposal is relatively small, it may be deducted
from the depreciation charge. In that situation the income statement (proﬁt and loss

difference when compared with the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) in
Table 8.9. If the gain or loss is material it will be reported separately.

A table of depreciation expense
To test your understanding of the impact of depreciation you may wish to use a table
of the type shown in Table 8.11. It shows that, whatever the proceeds of sale of the
asset, the total expense in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) will always
be the same but the amount of expense each year will vary.
If you compare the two tables (a) and (b) you will see that:
l total depreciation over the three years is the same in both cases;
l total net proﬁt after depreciation over the three years is the same in both cases;
l annual depreciation in Years 1 and 2 is lower in table (b);
l net proﬁt after depreciation in Years 1 and 2 is higher in table (b);
l net book value of the asset at the end of Years 1 and 2 is higher in table (b);
l the depreciation charge in Year 3 is higher in table (b);
l the net proﬁt after depreciation in Year 3 is lower in table (b).
This is an example of what is referred to in accounting as an allocation problem 
(a ‘sharing’ problem). The expense is the same in total but is allocated (shared) 
differently across the years of the asset’s life. As a result, there are different amounts

Chapter 8 Non-current (fixed) assets
225
in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) for each year but the total proﬁt over
the longer period is the same.
8.8.7
Impairment
An asset is impaired when the business will not be able to recover the amount shown
in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet), either through use or through
sale. If the enterprise believes that impairment may have taken place, it must carry out
an impairment review. This requires comparison of the net book value with the cash-
generating ability of the asset. If the comparison indicates that the recorded net book
value is too high, the value of the asset is reduced and there is an expense in the
income statement (proﬁt and loss account).8
The impairment test may be applied to intangible non-current (ﬁxed) assets such 
as goodwill, in order to justify non-amortisation. If no impairment is detected it 
may be argued that the asset has maintained its value and so amortisation is not 
necessary. If there has been impairment of the historical cost net book value, then the
loss in asset value becomes an expense for the income statement (proﬁt and loss
account).

(a) A van cost £60,000, was estimated to have a useful life of three years and a residual value of £6,000. It was

8.9 Summary
l A non-current asset is any asset that does not meet the deﬁnition of a current
asset.9 Non-current assets include tangible, intangible and ﬁnancial assets of a long-
term nature. These are also described as fixed assets.
l Tangible non-current (fixed) assets such as property, plant and equipment are
assets that have physical substance and are held for use in the production or sup-
ply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes on a
continuing basis in the reporting entity’s activities.
l An intangible asset is an identiﬁable non-monetary asset without physical 
substance.
l Users need information about the cost of an asset and the aggregate (accumulated)
depreciation as the separate components of net book value. Having this detail
allows users to estimate the proportion of asset life remaining to be used. This 
information will be reported in the notes to the statement of ﬁnancial position 
(balance sheet).
l Users also need information about the accounting policy on depreciation and its
impact on the reported asset values. This information will be found in the notes to
the accounts on accounting policies and the notes. There may also be a description
and discussion in the Operating and Financial Review, including a forward-looking
description of intended capital expenditure.
l Depreciation is estimated for the total life of the asset and then allocated to the
reporting periods involved, usually annual reporting. No particular method of
depreciation is required by law. Preparers of ﬁnancial statements have to exercise
choices. Companies in the UK commonly use straight-line depreciation. An 
alternative is reducing-balance depreciation. This is found more commonly in 
some other countries. Choice of depreciation method affects the comparability of
proﬁt.

On 1 January Year 1, Company A purchased a bus costing £70,000. It was estimated to have
a useful life of three years and a residual value of £4,000. It was sold for £8,000 on the last day
of Year 3.
On 1 January Year 1, Company B purchased a bus also costing £70,000. It was estimated to
have a useful life of three years and a residual value of £7,000. It was sold for £8,000 on the last
day of Year 3.
Both companies have a net profit of £50,000 before depreciation. Calculate the depreciation
charge and net profit of each company for each of the three years. Show that over the 
three years the total depreciation charge for each company is the same. (See Table 8.11 for 
an example.)

Problem solving and evaluation
C8.1 [S]
The Biscuit Manufacturing Company commenced business on 1 January Year 1 with capital 
of £22,000 contributed by the owner. It immediately paid cash for a biscuit machine costing
£22,000. It was estimated to have a useful life of four years and at the end of that time was 
estimated to have a residual value of £2,000. During each year of operation of the machine, 
the company collected £40,000 in cash from sale of biscuits and paid £17,000 in cash for
wages, ingredients and running costs.
Required
(a) Prepare spreadsheets for each of the four years analysing the transactions and events of
the company.
(b) Prepare a statement of financial position (balance sheet) at the end of Year 3 and an income
statement (profit and loss account) for that year.
(c) Explain to a non-accountant how to read and understand the statement of financial position
(balance sheet) and income statement (profit and loss account) you have prepared.
C8.2 [S]
The biscuit machine in question C8.1 was sold at the end of Year 4 for a price of £3,000.
Required
(a) Prepare the spreadsheet for Year 4 analysing the transactions and events of the year.
(b) Prepare the statement of financial position (balance sheet) at the end of Year 4 and the
income statement (profit and loss account) for Year 4.
(c) Explain to a non-accountant the accounting problems of finding that the asset was sold for
£3,000 when the original expectation was £2,000.

C8.3 [S]
The Souvenir Company purchased, on 1 January Year 1, a machine producing embossed 
souvenir badges. The machine cost £16,000 and was estimated to have a five-year life with a
residual value of £1,000.
Required
(a) Prepare a table of depreciation charges and net book value over the five-year life using
straight-line depreciation.
(b) Make a guess at the percentage rate to be used in the reducing-balance calculation, and
prepare a table of depreciation charges and net book value over the five years using reducing-
balance depreciation.
(c) Using the straight-line method of depreciation, demonstrate the effect on the accounting
equation of selling the asset at the end of Year 5 for a price of £2,500.
(d) Using the straight-line method of depreciation, demonstrate the effect on the accounting
equation of disposing of the asset at the end of Year 5 for a zero scrap value.
Activities for study groups
Turn to the annual report of a listed company which you have used for activities in previous
chapters. Find every item of information about non-current (fixed) assets. (Start with the finan-
cial statements and notes but look also at the operating and financial review, chief executive’s
review and other non-regulated information about the company.)
As a group, imagine you are the team of fund managers in a fund management company. You
are holding a briefing meeting at which each person explains to the others some feature of the
companies in which your fund invests. Today’s subject is non-current (fixed) assets. Each 
person should make a short presentation to the rest of the team covering:
1 the nature and significance of non-current (fixed) assets in the company;
2 the asset lives stated in the accounting policies for depreciation purposes;
3 the asset lives estimated by you from calculations of annual depreciation as a percentage of
asset cost;
4 the remaining useful life of assets as indicated by comparing accumulated depreciation with
asset cost;
5 the company’s plans for future investment in non-current (fixed) assets.

Supplement to Chapter 8
Recording non-current (fixed) assets and
depreciation
The rules for debit and credit entries in a ledger account should by now be familiar but are 
set out again in Table 8.12 for convenience. If you still feel unsure about any aspect of 
Exhibit 8.14 you should revisit the supplements of earlier chapters before attempting this one.
In this supplement you will concentrate primarily on the ledger accounts for the 
non-current (ﬁxed) assets. It takes The Removals Company of the main chapter as the
example for illustration.

Information to be recorded
The Removals Company commences business on 1 January Year 2 by paying cash for
a van costing £60,000. The cash was contributed by the owner. The van is estimated to
have a useful life of three years and is estimated to have a residual value of £6,000. On
31 December Year 2 the owner calculates annual depreciation of the van as £18,000,
using the formula:
During each year of operating the van, the company collected £120,000 in cash 
from customers and paid £58,000 in cash for drivers’ wages, fuel and other running
costs.
The transactions of Year 2 have been analysed in Table 8.3 for their impact on the
accounting equation. That same list may be used to set out the debit and credit book-
keeping entries, as shown in Table 8.13.

LEONA’s comment: The van is recorded by a debit entry and this entry remains in the
ledger account for as long as the van is in use by the company. A separate ledger account
is maintained for the cost of the asset because it is regarded as a useful piece of infor-
mation for purposes of financial statements.

LEONA’s comment: The accumulated depreciation account completes the story about the
van. It has an original cost of £60,000 and an accumulated depreciation at the end of Year
2 equal to £18,000. The accumulated depreciation account will always show a credit 
balance because it is the negative part of the asset. Deducting accumulated depreciation
from cost gives a net book value of £42,000.

LEONA’s comment: The depreciation of the year is a debit entry because it is an expense.
The process of depreciation is continuous but that is not convenient for ledger account
recording, so companies prefer a single calculation at the end of the year.
At this point a trial balance may be prepared, as explained in the supplement to
Chapter 5, and shown in Table 8.14.

Closing at the end of Year 2 and starting the ledger accounts
for Year 3
At the end of the year the balances on asset and liability accounts are carried forward to
the next year. The phrase ‘carried forward’ means that they are allowed to remain in
the ledger account at the start of the new year. The balances on revenue and expense
accounts are treated differently. After the trial balance has been prepared and checked,
the amounts on each revenue account and expense account are transferred to an income
statement (proﬁt and loss account). Transferring a balance requires an entry of the 
opposite type to the balance being transferred. A debit entry is made to transfer a
credit balance. A credit entry is made to transfer a debit balance. Matching but 
opposite entries are made in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account). This is
called ‘closing’ the expense or revenue account.

all items of revenue in the credit column and all items of expense in the debit column. The
balance in the third column shows, at the end of the ledger account, the profit of £44,000
for the year. There is one final entry to be made, and that is to transfer the £44,000 balance
of the income statement (profit and loss account) to the ownership interest account. That
requires a debit entry in the income statement (profit and loss account) to remove the
credit balance.

statement (profit and

LEONA’s comment: The transfer from the income statement (profit and loss account) is
shown as a credit entry in the ledger account for the ownership interest. That credit entry
matches the debit entry, removing the balance from the ledger account. As a check on the
common sense of the credit entry, go back to the table at the start of this Supplement
(Table 8.12), which shows that a credit entry records an increase in the ownership interest.
In the ledger account the credit entry of £44,000 increases the ownership interest from
£60,000 to £104,000.
Subsequent years
The income statement (proﬁt and loss account)s for Year 3 and Year 4 are identical 
to that for Year 2. The cash account ﬂows on in a pattern similar to that of Year 2. 
These ledger accounts are therefore not repeated here for Years 3 and 4. Attention is
concentrated on the asset at cost and the accumulated depreciation.

LEONA’s comment: The depreciation of the year is an income statement (profit and loss

year in Years 3 and 4 in the manner explained earlier for Year 2.
Disposal of the asset
At the end of Year 4 the asset is sold for a cash price of £6,000. To remove the asset
requires entries in the ‘Van at cost’ account (L3), the ‘Accumulated depreciation’

Chapter 8 Non-current (fixed) assets
237
account (L4) and the ‘Cash’ account (L2). The corresponding debit and credit entries
are recorded in a ‘Non-current (ﬁxed) asset disposal’ account (L9).
Table 8.15 shows the breakdown of the sale transaction into the removal of the asset
at cost, the removal of the accumulated depreciation, and the collection of cash. The
entry required to remove a balance on a ledger account is the opposite to the amount
of the balance. So in the ‘Van at cost’ account (L3) a credit entry of £60,000 is required
to remove a debit balance of £60,000. In the ‘Accumulated depreciation’ account (L4)
a debit entry is required to remove a credit balance of £54,000. In the ‘Cash’ account
(L2) there is a debit entry of £60,000 to show that the asset of cash 
has increased. In each case the ‘Disposal’ account (L9) collects the matching debit 
or credit.

LEONA’s comment: The disposal account is a very convenient way of bringing together all
the information about the disposal of the van. The first two lines show the full cost and
accumulated depreciation. The balance column, on the second line, shows that the differ-
ence between these two items is the net book value of £6,000. Collecting cash of £6,000
is seen to match exactly the net book value, which means that there is no depreciation
adjustment on disposal.
Sale for an amount greater than the net book value
In the main text of this chapter there is a discussion of the consequences of selling the
van for £9,000 cash. There would be no problem in recording that in the bookkeeping
system. Everything explained in the previous section would be unchanged except for
the amount of the cash received. The Disposal account would now be recorded as:

Formula for calculating percentage rate for reducing-balance 
depreciation
The rate of depreciation to be applied under the reducing-balance method of depre-
ciation may be calculated by the formula:
rate = (1 −n| (R/C)) × 100%
where:
n = the number of years of useful life
R = the estimated residual value
C = the cost of the asset.
For the example given in the main chapter:
N = 5 years
C = £1,000
R = £30 (The residual value must be of reasonable magnitude. To use an
amount of nil for the residual value would result in a rate of 100%.)
rate = (1 −
5 (30/1,000)) × 100%
To prove that the rate is 50% you will need a scientiﬁc calculator or a suitable 
computer package. You may know how to calculate a ﬁfth root using logarithms.
Otherwise, if you have a very basic calculator it may be easier to use trial-and-error
methods.

REAL WORLD CASE
Rexam plc
Rexam is a leading global consumer packaging
group and a leading global beverage can maker. 
The company serves a number of markets
including the beverage, personal care, healthcare
and food markets. The following extracts are
taken from the Directors’ Report and the Principal

Extracts from Directors’ Report
Across our beverage can sectors our vision is to keep
the metal in a closed material loop: our aim is for zero cans ending up in landfill following consumers’
use of the product. This makes good economic sense due to the high value of the materials, more
than covering the cost of their collection, as well as environmental sense with up to 95% of the
energy needed for primary production saved. As metal can be continually reused, every tonne of
recycled material offsets the need to use a tonne of virgin raw material.
Recycling rates for beverage cans vary across countries, due to different operating environments,
culture and lifestyles. We report these together with the targets set by industry associations of which
we are a member.

9.1 Introduction
This chapter will continue the progress through the statement of ﬁnancial pos-
ition (balance sheet) which we began in Chapter 8. As in that chapter, the approach 
will be:
l What are the principles for deﬁning and recognising these items?
l What are the information needs of users in respect of the particular items?
l What information is currently provided by companies to meet these needs?
l Does the information show the desirable qualitative characteristics of ﬁnancial
statements?
l What are the principles for measuring, and processes for recording, these items?
9.2 Definitions
Deﬁnitions were provided in Chapter 2. They are repeated here for convenience.
Definition
An asset is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from which
future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.1
A current asset is an asset that satisﬁes any of the following criteria:
(a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the 
entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
(c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period;
(d) it is cash or a cash equivalent.2

Activity 9.1
Chapter 9 Current assets
243
The following list is a sample of the current assets found in most company state-
ment of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)s:
l raw materials
l work in progress
l ﬁnished goods
l trade receivables (debtors)
l amounts owed by other companies in a group
l prepayments and accrued income
l investments held as current assets
l short-term bank deposits
l bank current account (also called ‘cash at bank’)
l cash in hand.
Using the definition provided, explain why each item in the foregoing list may be classed
as a current asset. Could a plot of land ever be treated as a current asset?
The deﬁnition of a current asset refers to ‘the entity’s normal operating cycle’. The
operating cycle experienced by many businesses lasts for 12 months, covering all the
seasons of one year. One year is the reporting period most commonly used by most
enterprises for reporting to external users of ﬁnancial statements.
9.3 The working capital cycle
Working capital is the amount of long-term ﬁnance the business has to provide in
order to keep current assets working for the business. Some short-term ﬁnance for
current assets is provided by the suppliers who give credit by allowing time to 
pay, but that is not usually sufﬁcient. Some short-term ﬁnance for current assets is 
provided by short-term bank loans but, in most cases, there still remains an excess of
current assets over current liabilities.
The working capital cycle of a business is the sequence of transactions and events,
involving current assets and current liabilities, through which the business makes a
proﬁt.
Figure 9.1 shows how the working capital cycle begins when suppliers allow the
business to obtain goods on credit terms, but do not insist on immediate payment.
While they are waiting for payment they are called trade creditors. The amounts
owing to suppliers as creditors are called trade payables in the statement of ﬁnancial
position (balance sheet). The goods obtained by the business are used in production,
held for resale or used in providing a service. While the goods acquired are held by
the business they are called the inventories (stocks) of the business. Any products
manufactured from these goods and held for resale are also part of the inventories
(stocks) of the business. The resulting product or service is sold to customers who may
pay immediately in cash, or may be allowed time to pay. If they are allowed time to
pay they become debtors of the business. Debtors eventually pay and the business
obtains cash. In the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) the amount due
from trade debtors is described as trade receivables. Cash is a general term used to
cover money held in the bank, and money held in notes and coins on the business
premises. Cash held in the bank will be in an account such as a current account which
allows immediate access. Finally the cash may be used to pay the suppliers who, as
creditors, have been waiting patiently for payment.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
244
Inventories (stocks), receivables (debtors) and cash are all current assets of the 
business and will be dealt with in this chapter. Creditors who have supplied goods 
to the business are current liabilities and will be dealt with in the next chapter.
Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. If the
working capital is low, then the business has a close match between current assets and
current liabilities but may risk not being able to pay its liabilities as they fall due. Not
all the current assets are instantly available in cash. There may be some delay in selling
the inventories (stocks) of unsold goods. An impatient supplier or bank manager 
may cause difﬁculties if cash is not available when payment of a liability is due. On
the other hand, if current assets are very much greater than current liabilities, then the
business has a large amount of ﬁnance tied up in the current assets when perhaps that
ﬁnance would be better employed in the acquisition of more ﬁxed assets to expand the
proﬁt-making capacity of the operations.
Definition
Working capital is the amount which a business must provide to finance the current
assets of a business, to the extent that these are not covered by current liabilities. 
It is calculated by deducting current liabilities from current assets.
9.4 Recognition
The general conditions for recognition were set out in Chapter 2. An item that meets
the deﬁnition of an asset should be recognised if there is sufﬁcient evidence that the
new asset has been created and the item can be measured at a monetary amount with
sufﬁcient reliability. There is no doubt that inventories (stocks), receivables (debtors),

Chapter 9 Current assets
245
investments and cash are commonly recognised in a statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet) but it is useful to be aware of the element of doubt which may 
be attached to the expectation of economic beneﬁt which creates the asset and to the
reliability of measurement. That awareness is essential to understanding the level 
of uncertainty which surrounds reported ﬁnancial statements.
9.4.1
Inventories (stocks)
‘Inventories’ means lists of items. You might come across an inventory if you rent a
ﬂat and the owner has a list of the contents that is checked at the start and end of your
tenancy. The pronunciation is IN-ven-t’rees, with stress on the ﬁrst syllable ‘IN’ and not
INVENTOR-ees, which sounds like a collection of inventors.
Definition
Inventories are assets:
(a) held for sale in the ordinary course of business;
(b) in the process of production for sale; or
(c) in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production process or in
the rendering of services.3
If a company is presenting its ﬁnancial statements using the IASB’s accounting system
you will probably see the description ‘inventories’. If the company is following UK
company law and UK ASB standards then you will probably see the description ‘stocks’.
The remainder of this chapter explains the IASB’s system for reporting inventories.
The rules of UK law and standards are very similar. In business entities there are three
main categories of inventories: raw materials, work in progress and ﬁnished goods.
Consider these in reverse order.
Finished goods
The future economic beneﬁt expected from ﬁnished goods is that they will be sold to
customers for a price which exceeds the cost of purchase or manufacture. That makes
a proﬁt which increases the ownership interest. However, until the sale is agreed 
with the customer, this expected beneﬁt is uncertain and the concept of prudence
(explained in Chapter 4) dictates that it is safer not to anticipate that the proﬁt will
arise. The value of the inventories of ﬁnished goods is therefore measured at the cost
of purchase or manufacture. In most cases that is a reliable measure because it is based
on recorded costs and is not anticipating an uncertain selling price. Sometimes there
may be a disappointment where goods are manufactured and then it is found there is
a lack of demand. Where there is strong doubt about the expected selling price, such
that it might be less than the cost of purchase or manufacture, the inventories (stock)
of ﬁnished goods are valued at the net realisable value. This is deﬁned as the estimated
proceeds from sale of the items in question, less all costs to be incurred in marketing,
selling and distributing these items.
The accounting policy note of most companies conﬁrms this prudent approach. You
will see in a later section of this chapter that Safe and Sure plc recognises inventories
in its statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) at the lower of cost and net real-
isable value.
Work in progress
During the course of production the asset of ﬁnished goods is gradually being created.
The expected future beneﬁt of that activity is gradually building up as the work moves

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
246
towards completion. A business could wait until the asset is totally ﬁnished, before
recognising the asset in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). That would
satisfy the concept of prudence, supported by the characteristic of faithful represen-
tation, but would run into problems with the characteristic of relevance. Where work
in progress is a substantial aspect of the operations of the business, users need to know
how much work in progress there is, whether it is increasing or decreasing, and what
risks are attached. The risks attached to work in progress are often greater than those
attached to ﬁnished goods because there is the risk of non-completion to add to all 
the risks faced when the goods are completed and awaiting sale. There is a reliable
measurement, in the cost of work completed at the date of the ﬁnancial year-end, but
careful checking is required by the managers of the business to ensure that this is a
reliable measure.
A particularly important type of work in progress is the construction contract
(long-term contract) such as may be found in the engineering and building industries.
A company building a bridge over three years will want to tell the shareholders about
the progress being made in creating proﬁt. Each year a portion of the total contract
price will be reported as turnover and costs of the period will be matched against that
turnover to calculate proﬁt. The value of the work completed will be recognised as an
asset in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet), sometimes called work in
progress. The reporting of proﬁt on construction contracts (long-term contracts) is
reviewed later in this chapter, in section 9.11.
Raw materials
The approach to recognition is the same as that for ﬁnished goods. Raw materials are
expected to create a beneﬁt by being used in the manufacture of goods for sale. On
grounds of prudence the proﬁt is not anticipated and the raw materials are measured
at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
9.4.2
Receivables (debtors) and prepayments
Debtors are those persons who owe money to a business. Usually the largest amount
shown under this heading relates to customers buying goods on credit. These are the
trade receivables (trade debtors). Additionally, the business may have lent money 
to another enterprise to help that enterprise in its activities. There may be loans to
employees to cover removal and relocation expenses or advances on salaries. The
business may be due to receive a refund of overpaid tax.
Trade receivables (debtors) meet the recognition conditions because there is an
expectation of beneﬁt when the customer pays. The proﬁt on the sale of the goods is
known because the customer has taken the goods or service and agreed the price.
Trade receivables (debtors) are therefore measured at the selling price of the goods
and the proﬁt is recognised in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account). There 
is a risk that the customer will not pay, but the view taken is that the risk of non-
payment should be seen quite separately from the risk of not making a proﬁt on a 
sale. The risk of non-payment is dealt with by reducing the reported value of the asset
using an estimate for doubtful debts. That process is explained later in the chapter.
Prepayments are amounts of expenses paid in advance. Insurance premiums, rent
of buildings, lease charges on a vehicle, road fund licences for the delivery vans and
lorries, are all examples of items which have to be paid for in advance. At the date 
of the ﬁnancial year-end some part of the future beneﬁt may remain. This is recog-
nised as the prepayment. Take the example of an insurance premium of £240 paid 
on 1 October to cover a 12-month period. At the company’s year-end of 31 December,
three months’ beneﬁt has expired but nine months’ beneﬁt remains. The statement of
ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) therefore reports a prepayment of £180.

Chapter 9 Current assets
247
Definition
Prepayment An amount paid for in advance for an benefit to the business, such as
insurance premiums or rent in advance. Initially recognised as an asset, then transferred
to expense in the period when the benefit is enjoyed.
9.4.3
Investments
Investments held as current assets are usually highly marketable and readily con-
vertible into cash. The expectation of future economic beneﬁt is therefore usually
sufﬁcient to meet the conditions of recognition. Measurement is more of a problem.
There are two possible measures. One is the cost of the investment and the other is the
market value. Recognising the investment at cost is prudent and reliable, but not as
relevant as the current market value which is the amount of cash that could be
released by sale of the investment. There is no agreed answer to this problem at the
present time, although the issue has been debated in the standard-setting context.
Most businesses report current asset investments at cost but a smaller number use the
market value. Using the market value is called marking to market. It is a departure
from the normal practice of recording assets at original cost but is justiﬁed in terms 
of the requirement of company law that ﬁnancial statements should show a true and
fair view (see Chapter 4). It is seen in companies whose business involves dealing in
investments.
9.4.4
Cash
Recognising cash is no problem either in the expectation of beneﬁt or in the measure-
ment of the asset. The amount is known either by counting cash in hand or by looking
at a statement from the bank which is holding the business bank account. The 
expectation of beneﬁt lies in making use of the cash in future to buy ﬁxed assets or 
to contribute to the working capital cycle so that the business earns a proﬁt. In the
meantime, cash which is surplus to immediate requirements should be deposited in
such a way that it is earning interest. Where a company has substantial cash balances
there should be indications in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) that
investment income has been earned, to provide a beneﬁt to the business.
This section has covered in some detail the characteristics of various groups of current
assets. Before reading the next section, write down what information you would expect 
to see, in respect of these groups of assets, in the statement of financial position (balance
sheet) and notes to the accounts. Then read the section and consider similarities to, or
differences from, the views given there.
9.5 Users’ needs for information
Investors have an interest in knowing that current assets are not overstated. If the assets
are overstated the proﬁt of the business will be overstated (see the explanation in
Chapter 4, using the accounting equation). They will want to know particularly whether
there has been allowance for inventories of goods which may not lead to sales and
whether there has been allowance for customers who may not be able to pay the debts
shown as due to the business. They may also want the reassurance that the auditors
have established the existence of all the current assets, particularly ensuring that a very
portable asset such as cash is where it ought to be in the ownership of the company.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
248
The needs of users do not stop with the investors. The trade creditors who supply
goods and services to the business are strongly reliant on the working capital cycle for
their eventual payment. Employees look for their salaries and wages from the cash
generated during the working capital cycle. They want to know that the cash will be
there on the day it is required, rather than being tied up in inventories or receivables
(debtors) awaiting release as cash. Tax collecting authorities, such as HMRC, have
deﬁnite dates on which payments are required. All these persons have an interest in
the working capital of the business and how it is managed. The concern of creditors
and employees is primarily with the ﬂow of cash and its availability on the day required.
That information will not appear in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)
but there will be some indications of ﬂow in the statement of cash ﬂows (outlined in
Chapter 3).

This company is a service company so it is not surprising that stocks do not ﬁgure
prominently in the overall collection of current assets. It is perhaps more surprising
that there are inventories of ﬁnished products, but reading the description of the busi-
ness shows that there is a Products Division which manufactures special cleaning
chemicals under the company name.
The note on receivables (debtors) shows that the main category is trade receivables
(debtors) with information to help assess the risks of the asset:

There is no indication of the nature of ‘other receivables (debtors)’. It could indicate
employees who have received loans or advances of salaries. It could indicate a loan 
to a company which has trading links with the group but is not a full subsidiary.
Prepayments are expenses paid in advance of gaining the beneﬁt, as explained in the
previous section of this chapter.
9.6.2
Accounting policy
It will be shown later in this chapter that the valuation of inventories is a matter of
potential variation from one person to the next, so it is important to know that the
company has followed an acceptable policy in its valuation of inventories. The
accounting policy note of Safe and Sure provides that conﬁrmation (see Exhibit 9.1).

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements

For the moment you will have to accept that this form of wording represents standard
practice, but each phrase will be explained later in the chapter.
9.6.3
Operating and financial review
The ﬁnance director of Safe and Sure commented as follows in his review:
The group’s businesses are structured to utilise as little ﬁxed and working capital as is con-
sistent with the proﬁt and earnings growth objective in order to produce a high cash ﬂow.
The focus on working capital is perhaps an indication of the importance seen in
explaining how the company manages its current assets and current liabilities. It also
shows that for this business the high cash ﬂow is planned and is not an accident of
events.
9.6.4
Analyst’s view
DAVID WILSON comments: This is a service business and so holds inventories of goods to
be used in the service process. The note to the statement of financial position (balance
sheet) does not actually say what the inventories are, so I asked when I made my visit. 
They tell me the raw materials are inventories of cleaning materials and chemicals for pro-
cesses such as disinfecting. My main concern is to be assured that there is nothing in the
inventories which could carry a risk of losing value through obsolescence or deterioration.
There is not much problem of that with cleaning materials. The finished goods took me 
by surprise until I found out that there is a Products Division. It was actually the cleaning
products that I knew best from years ago but I thought they had moved entirely into 
service contracts.
In any event, inventories are not all that important for this company. The receivables
(debtors) amount is much larger. I know they have a relatively low risk of bad debts
because most customers pay in advance for their contracts.
When I started as an analyst I worked alongside someone who had 20 years’ experi-
ence. He told me that he had always used what he called ‘the 10% test’ when looking at
inventories (stocks) and receivables (debtors) in a statement of financial position (balance
sheet). He worked out what effect a 10% error in the inventories or receivables would have
on the profit before tax. In this case a 10% error in inventories would be £2.7m. The profit
from operations is £195.2m. A difference of £2.7m on £195.2m is 1.4%. An error of 1.4%
in profit would not have a significant impact on the view of most investors. So in this com-
pany inventories is not a matter which needs time taken for questions. On the other hand,
a 10% error in receivables (debtors) would be £14.7m. That is 7.5% of profit from oper-
ations. So receivables (debtors) are worth more attention. The extended note explaining the
areas of risk is useful. If this were a company I didn’t know, I would ask about the quality
of the asset and the type of customer who is given credit. In fact I do know the answer
here. The finance director told me that when I met him. The receivables (debtors) are
largely public sector bodies such as local authorities and hospitals who insist on paying
after the work has been done to their satisfaction. There could be a risk of non-payment
because of shoddy work but there is little risk of non-payment through default.
Exhibit 9.1
Accounting policy note

Inventories (stocks and work in progress) are stated at the lower of cost and net
realisable value, using the first in first out principle. Cost includes all direct expenditure
and related overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition
and location.

Chapter 9 Current assets
251
The final point to note in relation to current assets is that this company is a cash-
generating business. I looked at the statement of cash flows for the past five years which
shows that the group builds up cash balances, buys another company, and then generates even
more cash. I suppose that can’t go on for ever but there are no signs of problems at present.
LEONA: I told you I would be looking for admissions of how much you rely on the auditor
without knowing it. Your ‘10% test’ is a very rough-and-ready example of the ratio analy-
sis we carry out on a systematic basis as part of our analytical review of the financial 
statements. Maybe one day I’ll tell you more about that. We have quite a long list of ratios
which we calculate. We also look at interrelationships between ratios and relative changes
in one compared with another.
It is also an application of what we call ‘materiality’. When we see an asset – in this case
it is receivables (debtors) – where an error in estimation of the asset value could cause 
a serious impact on profit, we identify that as a matter for special attention. We would
probably spend more time on receivables (debtors) than on inventories in our audit of this
company but we would target the risk-related aspects of what is reported about each
asset. For receivables (debtors) it is the risk of non-payment through either disputed debts
or lack of funds. For inventories it is the risk of obsolescence or similar loss which is not
covered by insurance.
Have you decided on how the company’s information on current assets meets the list
of desirable qualitative characteristics?
DAVID: You’re trying to get me to admit that I need the auditors. Reliability is in the auditors’
hands as far as the numbers go, but I place a lot of reliance on my assessment of the 
qualities of senior management when I meet them. You can’t audit that kind of feeling. It’s
all a matter of chemistry. Also, the main current asset is receivables (debtors) and I know
they are reliable because the finance director told me what class of customer was involved.
I didn’t need the auditors for that. Relevance probably scores about eight out of ten
because there aren’t any complications here with unusual types of inventories. Faithful 
representation and neutrality are something I leave to the auditors for now but I’ll be 
asking questions next year if the information in the financial statements turns out not to 
be neutral. Prudence, I know, is built into all aspects of accounting which uses historical
cost measures. That sometimes works against relevance. Completeness is not a problem
for current assets. The company is unlikely to leave anything out. They are more likely to
include too much. I do expect the auditor to check that the assets are there. Comparability
is a matter of presentation. This company has a five-year summary elsewhere in the annual
report and gives the previous year’s amounts in the financial statements. As for under-
standability, I like to think that I can see my way around figures for inventories, receivables
(debtors) and cash. I usually get the answers I want when I phone the financial controller.
LEONA: But don’t you see that by admitting that you have to ask more questions to help
you understand the amounts, there must be some further explanations which the company
could give in the annual report so that your understanding may be shared by others?
DAVID: My fund manager colleagues would say that only the professional investors have
the expertise. Even if more information were reported by companies, only the professionals
would know how to use it.
9.7 Measurement and recording
The basic measurement rule applying to all current assets is that they should be 
measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.4 The exception is receivables
(debtors) which are measured at selling price because the related proﬁt is earned when
the sale is made and not when the credit customer chooses to pay.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
252
The next three sections look at issues of measurement and recording, in relation to
inventories, receivables (debtors) and current asset investments, which are essential to
an understanding of how much variability and uncertainty lies behind the apparent
conﬁdence of the numbers reported in ﬁnancial statements.
9.8 Inventories (stocks) of raw materials and finished goods
The analysis of transactions involving inventories of raw materials, work in progress
and ﬁnished goods has been explained in detail in Chapter 6 and will not be repeated
here. This section examines the problems created by the general rule that inventories
must be valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. This rule is a consequence
of the prudence concept, based on not anticipating a sale until the goods are delivered
to the customer.
Net realisable value means the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to
make the sale. For example, damaged inventories are sold at auction for £10,000. The
auctioneer charges selling commission of 20% which is £2,000. The amount received
by the seller is £8,000, called the net realisable value.
Definition
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less
the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.5
This section covers ﬁrst of all the accounting equation in relation to the rule. It then
looks at the meaning of cost and the allocation of overhead costs. Various speciﬁc
models to deal with changing input prices are then discussed and the section con-
cludes with the rules to be applied in ﬁnancial reporting.
9.8.1
Lower of cost and net realisable value
Consider the example of a container of coffee beans purchased by a coffee manufac-
turer at a cost of £1,000. The beans are held for three months up to the date of the ﬁnan-
cial year-end. During that time there is a fall in the world price of coffee beans and the
container of coffee beans would sell for only £800 in the market.
When the asset is acquired, the impact on the accounting equation is an increase of
£1,000 in the asset of inventories and a decrease of £1,000 in the asset of cash.

At the end of the year the asset is found to be worth £800 and the ownership inter-
est is reduced because the asset has fallen in value. The asset is reduced by £200 and
an expense of loss of value in inventories value is reported in the income statement
(proﬁt and loss account).

Chapter 9 Current assets

If a business fails to report a fall in the value of the asset of inventories, the proﬁt of
the period will be overstated.
Where there are separate categories of inventories the rule of ‘lower of cost and net
realisable value’ must be applied to each category separately. Suppose, for example,
there is an inventory (stock) of paper at a cost of £2,000 with a net realisable value of
£2,300 and an inventory (stock) of pens with a cost of £1,800 and a net realisable value
of £1,400. The lower amount must be taken in each case, giving a value of £3,400 for
inventories (calculated as £2,000 plus £1,400).
9.8.2
Meaning of cost
The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other
costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.6 This
expenditure will include not only the cost of purchase but also costs of converting raw
materials into ﬁnished goods or services.
Costs of purchase include the price charged by the supplier, plus transport and 
handling costs, plus import duties and less discounts and subsidies.7 Costs of con-
version include items readily identiﬁable with the product, such as labour, expenses
and subcontractors’ costs directly related to the product. They also include produc-
tion overheads and any other overheads directly related to bringing the product or
service to its present condition and location. Production overheads are items such 
as depreciation of machines, service costs, rental paid for a factory, wages paid to
supervisory and support staff, costs of stores control and insurance of production
facilities.
Example
Take the example of a business which purchases 10 wooden furniture units for con-
version to a customer’s speciﬁcation for installation in a hotel. The units cost £200 each
and the labour cost of converting them is £100 each. Production overheads for the
period are ﬁxed at £3,500. Two units remain unsold at the end of the period. These two
units will be recorded in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) at £1,300,
calculated as £650 each (materials cost of £200 plus labour cost of £100 plus a share of
the production overheads at £350 per item).
That was easy because there were 10 identical units to take equal shares of the 
production overheads. But suppose they had all been different and required different
amounts of labour? Would it have been fair to share the overheads equally? Probably
not. The problems of sharing out production overhead costs create a chapter in them-
selves and are studied further as part of management accounting. You need to be
aware, in reading published accounting information, that there is considerable scope
for discretion to be exercised by management in the allocation of overheads between
completed goods and goods held in inventories. The general risk of overstatement of
assets applies here. If the asset is overstated by having too much production overhead
allocated, the proﬁt of the period is also overstated because it is not bearing the share
of production overheads which it should.
9.8.3
Costs when input prices are changing
One very tiresome problem faced by the accounts department in its record keeping is
that suppliers change their prices from time to time. Goods held in store may have
arrived at different times and at different unit prices. How does the accounts depart-
ment decide on the unit price to be charged to each job when all the materials look the
same once they are taken into store?

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
254
In some cases it may be possible to label the materials as they arrive so that they 
can be identiﬁed with the appropriate unit price. That is a very time-consuming 
process and would only be used for high-value low-volume items of materials. In
other cases a convenient method is needed which gives an answer that is useful and
approximately close to the true price of the units used. Some possibilities are shown in
Table 9.1 using three options – ﬁrst in ﬁrst out (FIFO), last in ﬁrst out (LIFO) and aver-
age cost. In each case, Table 9.1 takes a very simple approach, not complicated 
by having inventory at the start of the period. In real life the calculations can be even
more tricky.

There are three parts to this illustration. Part (a) contains a table setting out the data to

9.8.4
Approximation when dates are not recorded
In business there may not be time to keep the detailed records shown in the calculations
in Table 9.1. In such cases the sales volume is known in total but the dates of 
sales are not recorded. The calculation then uses the best approximation available,
which usually means working through the costs from the oldest date, for FIFO, or the
most recent date, for LIFO, without attempting to match the various batches bought
and sold during the year.
9.8.5
Choice of FIFO, LIFO or average cost
Look at table (c) of Table 9.1 and compare it with table (a) of that table. You will see
from table (a) that the total amount spent on materials during the month was £3,100.
You will see from table (c) that the total of the cost of goods issued to production, plus
the cost of unsold goods, is always £3,100 irrespective of which approach is taken. All
that differs is the allocation between goods used in production and goods remaining
unsold. Cost can never be gained or lost in total because of a particular allocation pro-
cess, provided the process is used consistently over time. The FIFO approach suffers
the disadvantage of matching outdated costs against current revenue. The LIFO
approach improves on FIFO by matching the most recent costs against revenue, but at
the expense of an inventory value which becomes increasingly out of date. The aver-
age cost lies between the two and becomes more intricate to recalculate as more items
come into inventory. In practice, the choice for internal reporting in management
accounting is a matter of ﬁnding the best method for the purpose.
There is an effect on proﬁt of the year which may inﬂuence management choice.
When prices are rising and inventories volumes are steady or increasing, FIFO gives a
lower cost of sales and so a higher proﬁt than LIFO. If there were no regulations, 
companies that wished to show high proﬁts (perhaps to impress investors buying
shares in the company) might prefer FIFO. Companies that wished to show lower
proﬁts (perhaps to reduce tax bills) might prefer LIFO.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
256
The IASB standard IAS 2 prohibits the use of LIFO. In the UK the tax authorities
will not accept LIFO valuation. In the USA the LIFO method of valuation is permitted.
Investors need to read the accounting policy note in the ﬁnancial statements to ﬁnd
which approach a company has used.
Look back to Table 9.1 and write your own table of data for goods received, unit price,
price paid and goods issued to production. Create calculations of cost of goods sold,
using the various models in Table 9.1 (FIFO, LIFO and average price). Check that the
value of goods issued to production, plus the value of goods held in stock, will always
add up to the same answer in total.
9.9 Receivables (debtors)
The measurement of receivables (debtors) requires attention to bad and doubtful
debts. A debt is described as a bad debt when there is no further hope of the customer
paying the amount owed. This might be due to the customer being declared bankrupt
or else disappearing without trace. If the customer is known to be in difﬁculties or
there is some dispute over the amount owed, the debt is described as a doubtful debt.
The company still hopes to recover the cash owed but realistically has some doubt.
Evidence of doubtful debts may be seen in slow payment, partial payments, the need
for several reminders or even rumours in the business community. A company will
usually analyse the age of its debts to help identify those which may be doubtful.
Example
At the end of Year 1 the Garden Pond Company has a statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet) comprising £2,000 receivables (debtors), £7,000 other assets and £9,000
ownership interest that consists of £1,800 ownership interest at the start of the period
and £7,200 proﬁt of the period. On the date of the ﬁnancial year-end the manager of
the company reviews the receivables (debtors) list and decides that debts amount-
ing to £200 are doubtful because there are rumours of a customer not paying other
suppliers in the trade. The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) at the end of
Year 1 is amended to show that the asset is of lower value than was thought and the
ownership interest has consequently diminished.
Table 9.2 shows the spreadsheet for analysis set out to reﬂect the accounting 
equation. The new column is the one headed provision for doubtful debts. This is included

in the assets section because it tells the user more about the asset of receivables
(debtors), although it is the negative part of the asset. It causes some confusion to those
who meet it for the ﬁrst time because anything called a provision is usually reported
under the heading of liabilities. However, on grounds of usefulness to readers and 
relevance to the provision of information about the asset, the provision for doubtful
debts has special treatment in being included as a negative aspect within the asset 
section of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet).
It is quite a difﬁcult matter for a company to be prudent in expressing doubt 
about a debtor while still pursuing the non-payer with a view to collection of the 
debt. To remove the debt from the record would be to admit defeat. Even to show a
separate provision among the liability headings might lead other customers to think,
‘Why not me also?’ However, companies are expected to provide information about
impairment of assets, as indicated in the case study of Safe and Sure.
The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) after incorporating a provision
for the doubtful debt would appear as in Table 9.3.
There is no single method of calculating the provision for doubtful debts. Some
companies consider separately the amount owed by each customer. To economise on
time, most companies use previous experience to estimate a percentage of total receiv-
ables (debtors). A mixture of approaches could be used, with known problems being
identiﬁed separately and a general percentage being applied to the rest.
9.9.1
Change in a provision
During Year 2 matters take an upward turn and in July the customer who was show-
ing signs of ﬁnancial distress manages to pay the amount of £200 owed. The effect on
the accounting equation is that the asset of cash is increased and the asset of debtor is
reduced by £200. The provision for doubtful debts is now no longer required and
could be transferred back to the income statement (proﬁt and loss account), but in
practice it tends to be left for tidying up at the end of the year.
The business continues and at the end of Year 2 the receivables (debtors) amount 
to £2,500. A review of the list of receivables (debtors) causes considerable doubt
regarding an amount of £350. It is decided to create a new provision of £350. The old
provision of £200 related to last year’s receivables (debtors) and is no longer required.
Table 9.4 shows the spreadsheet at the end of Year 2, before and after recording the
new provision for doubtful debts. It is assumed that the other assets have grown to
£10,000 and there is a proﬁt of £3,500 before amending the provision for doubtful debts.
The income statement (proﬁt and loss account) could show two separate entries,
one being £200 increase in ownership interest and the other being £350 decrease in

ownership interest. It is rather cumbersome in that form and most enterprises would
report as an expense, in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account), the single line:
Increase in provision for doubtful debts
£150
9.10 Prepayments
Prepayments arise when an item of expense is paid in advance of the beneﬁt being
received. A common example is the payment of an insurance premium. The payment
is made in advance for the year ahead and the beneﬁt is gradually used up as the year
goes along. The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) recognises the unex-
pired portion of the insurance premium as an asset, while the income statement (proﬁt
and loss account) reports the amount consumed during the period.
Example
On 1 October Year 1 a company paid £1,200 for one year’s vehicle insurance. At the
ﬁnancial year-end date of 31 December there have been three months’ beneﬁt used up
and there is a nine-month beneﬁt yet to come. The transactions relating to insurance
would be reported as in Table 9.5.

The effect of identifying the asset is to reduce the expense of the period from £1,200
to £300 and to hold the remaining £900 as a beneﬁt for the next accounting period. 
In Year 2 the amount of £900 will be transferred from the prepayment column to the
expense column, so that the decrease in the ownership interest is reported in the
period in which it occurs.
9.11 Revenue recognition
The sale of goods and services creates revenue for the business. Sometimes that rev-
enue is referred to as sales or turnover. The term revenue may also be applied to rents
received from letting out property, or interest received on investments made. In the
conceptual frameworks of various countries, different views are held of the exact
meaning and extent of the word revenue. The IASB deﬁnes revenue in terms of equity
(ownership interest).
Definition
Revenue is defined as the gross inflow of economic benefits during the period arising 
in the course of the ordinary activities of an enterprise when those inflows result in
increases in equity, other than increases relating to contributions from equity
participants.8
The main problem in recognition of revenue lies in the timing. Assets are recog-
nised at a point in time but revenue is created over a period of time. What are the rules
for deciding on the time period for which revenue should be reported? One sugges-
tion has been that the critical event is the important factor.9 When goods are produced
or services are carried out, there is one part of the process which is critical to providing
sufﬁcient reassurance that the revenue has been earned by the efforts of the enterprise.
For the sale of goods the point of delivery to the customer is the usual critical event
which determines the date of revenue recognition. For a contract of service, the 
critical event is the production of the service.
9.11.1
Contract revenue
Where the service extends over more than one time period, the revenue may be split
over the time periods involved. That may happen in a civil engineering or a building
contract. In each year of the contract a portion of the revenue will be matched against
costs of the period so as to report a portion of proﬁt.
Take the example of a two-year bridge-building contract. The contract price is
£60m. Two-thirds of the work has been completed in Year 1 and it is expected that the
remainder will be completed in Year 2. The costs incurred in Year 1 are £34m and the
costs expected for Year 2 are £17m.
The income statement (proﬁt and loss account) of the business for Year 1 will
report, in respect of this contract, turnover of £40m less costs of £34m giving proﬁt 
of £6m. This gives a fair representation of the proﬁt earned by the activity of the year
(as two-thirds of the total). An independent expert, in this case an engineer, would
conﬁrm that the work had been completed satisfactorily to date. The effect on the
accounting equation would be:
Assets ↑↓
−
Liabilities
=
Ownership interest ↑
+ £40m
+ £6m
−£34m

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
260
Reporting contract revenue of £40m in Year 1 will increase the ownership interest
by £40m. A matching asset will be reported, representing the value of the contract at
that stage. The value of £40m shown for the construction contract represents the aggre-
gate amount of costs incurred plus recognised proﬁts to date.
In the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) the expenses of £34m are reported
in the usual way and a proﬁt of £6m results. All being well, the income statement
(proﬁt and loss account) of Year 2 will report the remaining £20m of revenue minus
£17m of expenses, leaving a proﬁt of £3m. Over the two years the total proﬁt of £9m
will be reported.
Users of accounting information need to pay particular attention to contract 
revenue in a business and ask some careful questions. Has prudence been exercised 
in deciding what portion of revenue to report? Is there a risk that the future costs 
will escalate and there will be an overall loss? They should look carefully at the 
provisions section of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) (see 
Chapter 11).
Where the customer has paid money in advance as an instalment towards the ﬁnal
contract price, the effect on the accounting equation is to increase the asset of cash 
and create a liability towards the customer. These amounts received in advance from
customers may be described as ‘progress billings’, ‘payments on account’, or ‘pay-
ments in advance’. There is a liability because the business has an obligation to repay
the customer if the contract is not completed on time or on speciﬁcation. Although 
it might be expected that the liability towards the customer would appear in the 
current liabilities section of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet), that
does not happen. The liability in respect of payments made in advance is deducted
from the value of the contract and the resulting net ﬁgure is reported as construc-
tion contracts in the current assets section of the statement of ﬁnancial position 
(balance sheet). That may mean that, at ﬁrst glance at the statement of ﬁnancial pos-
ition (balance sheet), the reader does not realise the true size of the contract being
undertaken for the customer. There is no guarantee that any better information will 
be found anywhere else in the ﬁnancial statements, because turnover is aggregated 
for all activities. For the analyst as an expert user, construction contracts (long-term
contracts) require a great deal of careful questioning if the underlying details are to 
be understood.
9.11.2
A continuing debate
There are problems in revenue recognition that continue to be debated. Consider three
examples. In the ﬁrst, a ﬁlm production company sells a programme to a television
company which agrees to pay royalties every time the programme is broadcast. In the
second, a farmer sells a cow to a neighbour in return for ﬁve sheep. In the third, a
mobile phone company charges customers a start-up fee that is 24 times the monthly
rental and service charge. There is no speciﬁc accounting standard to cover any of
these situations. One approach to each is to ask, ‘Has the revenue been earned?’ The
companies would all answer, ‘Yes, we have completed our side of the transaction.’ So
perhaps revenue should be recognised in all three cases. Another approach is to ask,
‘Are there any risks related to recognising revenue?’ The answer is, ‘Yes – the pro-
gramme may never be broadcast; we are not sure about the exchange values between
cows and sheep; and the telephone company may not be able to provide the service
for the long period implied by the high initial charge.’ So perhaps the revenue should
not be reported until the risks are diminished. Both views are being applied, with the
result that there has been some lack of clarity and comparability as new types of busi-
ness have emerged. It is necessary to pay careful attention to the accounting policy on
revenue recognition.

Chapter 9 Current assets
261
9.12 Summary
l A current asset is an asset that satisﬁes any of the following criteria:
(a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the
entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
(c) it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the date of the ﬁnancial 
year-end;
(d) it is cash or a cash equivalent.
l Working capital is the amount which a business must provide to ﬁnance the current
assets of a business, to the extent that these are not covered by current liabilities. 
It is calculated by deducting current liabilities from current assets.
l Inventories (stocks), receivables (debtors), investments and cash are commonly
recognised in a balance sheet. If there is doubt attached to the expectation of econ-
omic beneﬁt which creates the asset and to the reliability of measurement, then this
is recognised by making a provision such as the provision for doubtful debts.
l Users need information about the working capital of the business to judge whether
it is suitable to support the activities of the business. Information provided to help
users includes: detailed notes of current assets and current liabilities; notes of
accounting policy describing the valuation of current assets; and a discussion of
working capital management in the operating and ﬁnancial review.
l Inventories (stocks) are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
l Receivables (debtors) are measured at the amount receivable on settlement less any
provision for doubtful debts.
l Prepayments are amounts paid in advance for beneﬁts expected. Prepayments are
assets until the beneﬁt is used up. The amount is then transferred from an asset to
an expense.
l Revenue is deﬁned as the gross inﬂow of economic beneﬁts during the period aris-
ing in the course of the ordinary activities of an enterprise when those inﬂows result
in increases in equity, other than increases relating to contributions from equity
participants.
l If revenues are earned over more than one time period (e.g. on long-term contracts)
then the revenue is allocated across time periods in proportion to the amount of
work completed.

the record. What will be the effect on the income statement (profit and loss account) and
the statement of financial position (balance sheet) when this omission is rectified?
A9.12 [S] On reviewing the financial statements, the company accountant discovers that an
amount of £154,000 owed by a customer will be irrecoverable because the customer
has fled the country. What will be the effect on the income statement (profit and loss
account) and the statement of financial position (balance sheet) when this event is

At the end of Year 3 the Bed Company has a statement of financial position (balance sheet)
comprising £3,000 receivables (debtors), £8,000 other assets and £11,000 ownership interest,
consisting of £2,000 ownership interest at the start of the period and £9,000 profit of the period.
On the date of the financial year-end the manager of the company reviews the receivables
(debtors) list and decides that debts amounting to £450 are doubtful because the customers
have not replied to repeated requests for payment.
Required
(a) Prepare an accounting equation spreadsheet to show the effect of the provision. (See 
Table 9.2 for an illustration.)
(b) Show the statement of financial position (balance sheet) information. (See Table 9.3 for an
illustration.)
B9.4
The Bed Company continues trading during Year 4. The statement of financial position (balance
sheet) at the end of Year 4, in its first draft, showed receivables (debtors) as £4,850 and the pro-
vision for doubtful debts unchanged from Year 3 at £450. Enquiry showed that during Year 4
some of the receivables (debtors) at the end of Year 3 had been confirmed as bad. They
amounted to £250 but nothing had yet been recorded. The management wish to make the pro-
vision £550 at the end of Year 4. Other assets amount to £12,000, ownership interest at the start
of Year 4 is £10,550 and the profit is £5,750.
Required
Prepare an accounting equation spreadsheet to show the effect of the bad debt being 
recognised and of the decision to make a provision at the end of Year 4. (See Table 9.4 for an
illustration.)

Problem solving and evaluation
C9.1
A fire destroyed a company’s detailed stock records and much of the merchandise held in
stock. The company accountant was able to discover that stock at the beginning of the period
was £40,000, purchases up to the date of the fire were £250,000, and sales up to the date of
the fire were £400,000. In past periods, the company has earned a gross profit of 35% of sales.
Required
Calculate the cost of the stock destroyed by the fire.

It is the policy of Seaton Ltd to make provision for doubtful debts at a rate of 10% per annum
on all debtor balances at the end of the year, after deducting any known bad debts at the same
date. The following table sets out the total receivables (debtors) as shown by the accounting
records and known bad debts to be deducted from that total. There is no provision at

Activities for study groups
Turn to the annual report of a listed company which you have used for activities in previous
chapters. Find every item of information about current assets. (Start with the financial state-
ments and notes but look also at the operating and financial review, chief executive’s review
and other non-regulated information about the company.)
As a group, imagine you are the team of fund managers in a fund management company.
You are holding a briefing meeting at which each person explains to the others some feature of
the companies in which your fund invests. Today’s subject is current assets. Each person
should make a short presentation to the rest of the team covering:
1 The nature and significance of current assets in the company.
2 The effect on profit of a 10% error in estimation of any one of the major categories of 
current asset.
3 The company’s comments, if any, on its present investment in working capital and its future
intentions.
4 The risks which might attach to the inventories of the company.
5 The liquidity of the company.
6 The trends in current assets since last year (or over five years if a comparative table is 
provided).
7 The ratio of current assets to current liabilities.

Supplement to Chapter 9
Bookkeeping entries for (a) bad and doubtful
debts; and (b) prepayments
The debit and credit recording aspects of inventories of raw materials and ﬁnished goods were
explained in the supplement to Chapter 6. That leaves, for this supplement, the recording of 
bad and doubtful debts as a new area where potential care is needed. Prepayments are also 
illustrated here.
Provision for doubtful debts
The following ledger accounts illustrate the recording of the transactions analysed in
section 9.9. Look back to that section for the description and analysis of the trans-
actions. The debit and credit analysis is shown in Table 9.6. So that you will not be 
confused by additional information, the ledger accounts presented here show only
sufﬁcient information to illustrate the recording of transactions relating to doubtful
debts. Leona comments on the main features.

LEONA: The ledger account for receivables (debtors) has no entries relating to doubtful
debts. That is important because although there may be doubts from the viewpoint of the
business, the customer still has a duty to pay and should be encouraged by all the usual
means. Keeping the full record of amounts due is an important part of ensuring that all
assets of the business are looked after.

LEONA: The provision for doubtful debts is a credit balance because it is the negative part
of an asset. It keeps a separate record of doubt about the full value of the asset. A credit
entry in the ledger account increases the amount of the provision and a debit entry
decreases the amount of the provision.

LEONA: In Year 1 of this example the provision is established for the first time so there is
one debit entry to establish an expense which decreases the profit (as a part of the owner-
ship interest). In Year 2 of this example the old provision is removed and a new provision
created. The overall effect is that the provision increases by £150. Some people would take
a shortcut and make one entry of £150 to increase the provision from £200 to £350 but 
I am not keen on shortcuts. They sometimes lead to disaster. Separate entries make me
think carefully about the effect of each.
Recording a doubtful debt which turns bad
Suppose that in July of Year 2 it was found that the doubtful debt turned totally bad
because the customer was declared bankrupt. The effect on the accounting equation 
is that the asset of debtor is removed. That would normally reduce the ownership

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
268
interest but on this occasion the impact on ownership interest was anticipated at the
end of Year 1 and so the provision for doubtful debts is now used to match the
decrease in the asset. The analysis of the transaction would be:
Date
Transaction or event
Debit
Credit
Year 2
July
Doubtful debt becomes bad
Provision for 
Receivables 
doubtful debts £200
(debtors) £200
The consequence of using the provision for doubtful debts is that there is no impact
on the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) of Year 2 of a bad debt which was
known to be likely at the end of Year 1. However, when the provision for doubtful
debts is reviewed at the end of Year 2 there is no reversal of the £200 because that has
already been used during the year. The charge of £350 for Year 2 relates solely to the
provision for doubt in respect of receivables (debtors) owing money at the end of Year 2.
Prepayments
The prepayment transaction analysed in the chapter was as follows. On 1 October of
Year 1 a company paid £1,200 for one year’s vehicle insurance. At the ﬁnancial year-
end date of 31 December there have been three months’ beneﬁt used up and there is a
nine-month beneﬁt yet to come. (See Table 9.7.)

LEONA: Although it is known in October that there will be a balance remaining at the end
of the year, it is usually regarded as more convenient to debit the entire payment as an
expense of the period initially. The expense is reviewed at the end of the year and £900 is
found to be an asset which benefits the future. It is transferred to the asset account for pre-
payments, leaving only the expense of £300 relating to this period, which is transferred to
the income statement (profit and loss account).

LEONA: The prepayment account is an asset account and therefore the balance remains 
in the account until the benefit asset is used up. During Year 2 the benefit will disappear
and the asset will become an expense. The bookkeeping treatment will be to credit the 
prepayment account and debit the insurance expense account.

REAL WORLD CASE
John Lewis Partnership
The following extracts relating to
suppliers and accounts payable are
taken from the annual report of the 
John Lewis Partnership.
Customers, products and suppliers 
(Extract from Business Review, p. 20)
The Partnership’s vision is for long term
sustainable trading. We are committed
to selling responsibly sourced products,
dealing fairly with suppliers, engaging
with and acting in the interests of our
customers and providing excellent value and unrivalled customer service. 
In 2011 Waitrose came first in Which? magazine’s supermarket survey of over 12,000 shoppers 
and John Lewis was voted Britain’s favourite retailer for the fourth year running by retail analysts
Verdict. The Partnership works with over 5,000 suppliers to sell quality products, supported by 
ethical and environmental standards and policies, paying them a fair price and helping them to
reinvest in their businesses.
In June 2011, the Partnership joined the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), a collaborative arrangement
between businesses, trade unions and NGOs which aims to improve the lives of workers
internationally.
The Partnership has two supply chain foundations: the Waitrose Foundation established in 2005,
which contributed £550,000 to projects supporting communities in Waitrose’s supply chain in 
Africa in 2011/12; and the John Lewis Foundation which has invested £58,500 in 2011/12 
in projects which support and service the communities where John Lewis products are 
sourced.
Payments to suppliers (Extract from Directors’ Report, p. 30)
The group’s policy on the payment of its suppliers is to agree terms of payment in advance and,
provided a supplier fulfils the agreement, to pay promptly in accordance with those terms. The
group’s trade creditors at 28 January 2012 were equivalent to 27 days of average purchases 
(2011: 24 days).

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
272
10.1 Introduction
The theme running through this textbook is the accounting equation:
Assets
minus
Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
It was explained in Chapter 2 that the ownership interest is the residual amount
found by deducting all liabilities of the company from total assets. Chapters 8 and 9
have taken you through aspects of non-current and current assets which are par-
ticularly signiﬁcant to users of ﬁnancial statements. Chapters 10 and 11 complete the
left-hand side of the equation by providing a similar overview of current liabilities and
non-current liabilities.
This chapter follows the approach established in Chapters 8 and 9:
l What are the principles for deﬁning and recognising these items?
l What are the information needs of users in respect of the particular items?
l What information is currently provided by companies to meet these needs?
l Does the information show the desirable qualitative characteristics of ﬁnancial
statements?
l What are the principles for measuring, and processes for recording, these items?
10.2 Definitions
The deﬁnition of a liability, as provided in Chapter 2, is repeated here:
Definitions
A liability is a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement 
of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying
economic benefits.1
A current liability is a liability which satisfies any of the following criteria:
(a) it is expected to be settled in the entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
(c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period.2
Learning
outcomes
After studying this chapter you should be able to:
l Define a liability and explain the distinguishing feature of current liabilities.
l Explain the conditions for recognition of liabilities.
l Explain how the information presented in a company’s statement of financial
position (balance sheet) and notes, in relation to liabilities, meets the needs 
of users.
l Explain the features of current liabilities and the approach to measurement and
recording.
l Explain the terms ‘accruals’ and ‘matching concept’ and show how they are
applied to expenses of the period.
l Explain how liabilities for taxation arise in companies.
Additionally, for those who choose to study the supplement:
l Prepare the ledger accounts to record accruals.

Activity 10.1
Chapter 10 Current liabilities
273
Supplement 7.1 to Chapter 7 sets out the information to be presented on the face of
the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of companies using the IASB system
in their ﬁnancial statements. The only current liabilities listed there are item (j) trade
and other payables, item (l) ﬁnancial liabilities (where these are short-term loans) and
(m) liabilities for current tax.
Supplement 7.2 to Chapter 7 sets out the information to be presented in the ﬁnancial
statements of companies that are using the UK Companies Act and UK ASB standards.
There is one heading for current liabilities and a detailed list below. The list is as follows:
E Creditors: amounts falling due within one year
1 Debenture loans
2 Bank loans and overdrafts
3 Payments received on account
4 Trade creditors
5 Bills of exchange payable
6 Amounts owed to group undertakings
7 Amounts owed to undertakings in which the company has a participating interest
8 Other creditors including taxation and social security
9 Accruals and deferred income
Look back to Table 2.3, which analyses some common types of liability. Set up on a 
blank sheet a similar table with four columns and headings for: type of liability; obligation;
transfer of economic benefits; and past transaction or event. Then close the book and
write down any ten liabilities you have come across during your study. Fill in all the
columns as a check that, at this stage, you really understand what creates a liability.
10.3 Recognition
The general conditions for recognition were set out in Chapter 2. An item that meets
the deﬁnition of a liability should be recognised if there is sufﬁcient evidence that the
liability has been created and that the item has a cost or value that can be measured
with sufﬁcient reliability. In practice, recognition problems related to liabilities centre
on ensuring that none is omitted which ought to be included. This is in contrast to the
case of assets where there is a need, in practice, to guard against over-enthusiastic
inclusion of items which do not meet the recognition conditions.
10.3.1
Risk of understatement of liabilities
The risk related to liabilities is therefore the risk of understatement. This is explained
in Chapter 4 under the heading of prudence. The risk of understatement of liabilities
is that it will result in overstatement of the ownership interest.
In recent years the standard-setting bodies have devoted quite strenuous efforts to
discouraging companies from keeping liabilities (and related assets) off the statement
of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). This problem is called off-balance sheet finance
and will be explained in Chapter 14.
10.3.2
Non-recognition: contingent liabilities
There are some obligations of the company which fail the recognition test because
there is signiﬁcant uncertainty about future events that may cause beneﬁts to ﬂow
from the company. The uncertainty may be about the occurrence of the event or about

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
274
the measurement of the consequences. These are called contingent liabilities because
they are contingent upon (depend upon) some future event happening. Examples are:
l A company is involved in legal action where a customer is seeking damages for ill-
ness allegedly caused by the company’s product. If the customer is successful, there
will be more claims. The company does not believe that the customer will succeed.
l A parent company has given guarantees to a bank that it will meet the overdraft
and loans of a subsidiary company if that company defaults on repayment. At the
present time there is no reason to suppose that any default will take place.
l A company is under investigation by the Competition Commission for possible
price-ﬁxing within the industry in contravention of an order prohibiting restrictive
practices. If there is found to be a restrictive practice, a penalty may be imposed.
l The company has acquired a subsidiary in Australia where the tax authorities have
raised an action for tax due on a disputed transaction which occurred before the
subsidiary was acquired. The action is being defended strenuously.
In each of these examples, the company is convinced that it will not have a liability
at the end of the day, but the users of the ﬁnancial statements may wish to have some
indication of the upper bounds of the liability if the company’s optimism proves
unfounded. There may, however, be a problem for the company in publishing an 
estimate of the amount of the possible liability because it may be seen as admitting 
liability and furthermore may require disclosure of commercially sensitive conﬁdential
information.
Where a contingent liability is identiﬁed, the obligation is not recognised in the
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) but it may be important that users of 
the ﬁnancial statements are aware of the problem. There will therefore be a note to the
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) reporting the circumstances of the con-
tingent liability and sometimes giving an indication of the amount involved. Because
of the conﬁdentiality aspect, companies tend to give little information about the ﬁnancial
effect of a contingent liability, but some will try to set the outer limits of the liability.
Definition
A contingent liability is either:
(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not 
wholly within the control of the entity; or
(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:
(i) either it is not probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation;
(ii) or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.3
A company should disclose a brief description of the nature of the contingent 
liability and, where practicable:
(a) an estimate of its ﬁnancial effect;
(b) an indication of the uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of any outﬂow;
and
(c) the possibility of any reimbursement.4
Rules about measurement are given in detail in the accounting standard. The detail
is not necessary for an introductory course.
10.3.3
Changing thoughts on contingencies
In 2005 the IASB issued a proposal to eliminate the term ‘contingent liability’ because
if the item cannot be recognised in a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)

Activity 10.2
Chapter 10 Current liabilities
275
then it cannot be a true liability. The proposal of the IASB was that items carrying an
unconditional obligation should be recognised as a liability and measured at the best
estimate. Any uncertain event affecting the measurement of the obligation would be
explained in a note. Items that do not carry an unconditional obligation are seen as
business risks. Such business risks would be reported as a note to the ﬁnancial state-
ments because they may have a signiﬁcant effect on the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities in the near future. These changing thoughts on contingencies do not change
the overall amount of information to be disclosed about contingencies but the method
of disclosure may change. This development was not taken further because the ﬁnan-
cial crisis of 2007–08 brought other accounting problems to the fore. At some point the
IASB will revisit contingent liabilities.
Consider the four examples of contingent liability given at the start of this section. Based
on the definition, explain why each is a contingent liability.
10.4 Users’ needs for information
There are two aspects of information in relation to liabilities. The ﬁrst relates to the
amount owed (sometimes called the principal sum or the capital amount) and the 
second relates to the cost of servicing the loan (usually the payment of interest).
In respect of current liabilities, other than a bank overdraft or bank loans repayable
within the year, it is unlikely that interest will be payable, and so generally there will
be no information about interest charges. The shareholders in the company will be
concerned that there are adequate current assets to meet the current liabilities as they
fall due. Those who supply goods and services will want to be reassured that payment
will be made on the due date.
Owners of a company need to know how much the company owes to other parties
because the owners are at the end of the queue when it comes to sharing out the assets
of the company if it closes down. Many of those who supply goods and services 
are what is known as unsecured creditors, which means they come at the end of the
list of creditors. They will also have an interest in the balance of long-term and current
liabilities.

Trade payables (trade creditors) comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 27 days. Most suppliers charge
no interest on the trade payables for the first 30 days from the date of the invoice.
Thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding balances at various interest rates.
The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables
are paid within the agreed credit terms.
The note describing payment policy provides reassurance about avoiding the risk
of additional costs through late payment. The company is complying with the ﬁnan-
cial reporting standard IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. Its general objective is
to provide qualitative and quantitative information about exposure to risks arising
from ﬁnancial instruments. Any ﬁnancial liability is an example of a ﬁnancial instru-
ment. You will therefore see descriptions of risk relating to ﬁnancial liabilities in
annual reports. The detail of that standard is beyond the scope of a ﬁrst-level text.

The report of the ﬁnance director provides further insight into the currency spread
of the bank borrowings:
Foreign currency: £35.2m of foreign currency bank borrowings have been incurred to fund
overseas acquisition. The main borrowings were £26.8m in US dollars and £8.4m in
Japanese yen. The borrowings are mainly from banks on a short-term basis, with a maturity
of up to one year, and we have ﬁxed the interest rate on $20m of the US dollar loans through
to November, Year 7, at an overall cost of 4.46%.
All material foreign currency transactions are matched back into the currency of the
group company undertaking the transaction.
David Wilson has already commented in Chapters 4 and 7 on some aspects of the
liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements of Safe and Sure plc. Here he is explaining to
Leona, in the coffee bar at the health club, his views on current liabilities in particular.
DAVID: Current liabilities are relatively similar in total to last year so there are no particular
questions to ask there.
Then I start to think about the limits of risk. There is £40m due for repayment to the bank
within the year. Will the company have any problem finding this amount? With £105m in cash
and cash equivalents, it seems unlikely that there could be a problem. The entire current 

Activity 10.3
Chapter 10 Current liabilities
277
liabilities are £199.9m, all of which could be met from the cash and cash equivalents and
receivables (debtors).
There is another risk that £40m shown as owing to the banks may be the wrong 
measure of the liability if exchange rates move against the company. Whenever I see foreign 
borrowings I want to know more about the currency of borrowings. You know from your
economics class the theory of interest rates and currency exchange rates. It backs up my
rule of thumb that borrowing in currencies which are weak means paying high rates of
interest. Borrowing in currencies which are strong will mean paying lower rates of interest
but runs a greater risk of having to use up additional pounds sterling to repay the loan if
the foreign currency strengthens more. Information about the currency mix of loans 
is something I can probably get from the company if I need it. In this case, the finance
director’s report is sufficiently informative for my purposes. In past years, before finance
directors started providing explanations in the annual report, we were asking these ques-
tions at face-to-face meetings.
LEONA: What you have described is similar in many respects to the analytical review car-
ried out by the auditors. We do much more than merely check the bookkeeping entries and
the paperwork. We are looking at whether the statement of financial position (balance
sheet) makes sense and whether any items have changed without sufficient explanation.
10.6 Measurement and recording
Liabilities are measured at the amount originally received from the lender of ﬁnance
or supplier of goods and services, plus any additional charges incurred such as rolled-
up interest added to a loan. This is generally agreed to be a useful measure of the 
obligation to transfer economic beneﬁts from the company.
From the accounting equation it may be seen that an increase in a liability must be
related either to an increase in an asset or a decrease in the ownership interest. Usually
any related decrease in the ownership interest will be reported in the statement of
ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) as an expense.
The most signiﬁcant current liabilities for most companies are bank borrowing and
trade creditors. Both of these are essential sources of ﬁnance for small companies and
are an important aspect, if not essential, for larger companies.
Write down the documentation you would expect to see as evidence of the money
amount of the following liabilities:
l bank overdraft;
l amount owing to a trade supplier.
Now read the next sections and find whether your answer matches the information in the text.
10.6.1
Bank overdraft finance
Banks provide short-term ﬁnance to companies in the form of an overdraft on a current
account. The advantage of an overdraft is its ﬂexibility. When the cash needs of the
company increase with seasonal factors, the company can continue to write cheques and
watch the overdraft increase. When the goods and services are sold and cash begins to
ﬂow in, the company should be able to watch the overdraft decrease again. The most
obvious example of a business which operates in this pattern is farming. The farmer
uses the overdraft to ﬁnance the acquisition of seed for arable farming, or feed through
the winter for stock farming and to cover the period when the crops or animals are
growing and maturing. The overdraft is reduced when the crops or the animals are sold.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
278
The main disadvantage of an overdraft is that it is repayable on demand. The
farmer whose crop fails because of bad weather knows the problem of being unable 
to repay the overdraft. Having overdraft ﬁnancing increases the worries of those 
who manage the company. The other disadvantage is that the interest payable on
overdrafts is variable. When interest rates increase, the cost of the overdraft increases.
Furthermore, for small companies there are often complaints that the rate of interest
charged is high compared with that available to larger companies. The banks answer
that the rates charged reﬂect relative risk and it is their experience that small com-
panies are more risky.
10.6.2
Trade payables (trade creditors)
It is a strong feature of many industries that one enterprise is willing to supply goods
to another in advance of being paid. Most suppliers will state terms of payment (e.g.
the invoice must be paid within 30 days) and some will offer a discount for prompt
payment. In the UK it has not been traditional to charge interest on overdue accounts
but this practice is growing as suppliers realise there is a high cost to themselves of not
collecting cash in good time. A supplier who is waiting to be paid is called a trade
creditor.
Trade creditors rarely have any security for payment of the amount due to them, so
that if a customer fails to pay the supplier must wait in the queue with other suppliers
and hope for a share of some distribution. They are described as unsecured creditors.
Some suppliers will include in the contract a condition that the goods remain the 
property of the supplier should the customer fail to pay. This is called retention of 
title (ROT) and will be noted in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of a
company which has bought goods on these terms. Retention of title may offer some
protection to the unpaid supplier but requires very prompt action to recover identiﬁable
goods in the event of difﬁculty.
Some suppliers send goods to a customer on a sale-or-return basis. If there are no
conditions to prevent return then the goods will not appear as stock in the statement
of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of the customer and there will be no indication of
a liability. This practice is particularly common in the motor industry where manu-
facturers send cars to showrooms for sale or return within a speciﬁed period of time.
Omitting the inventories and the related potential liability is referred to as off-balance-
sheet finance, a topic explored further in Chapter 14.
Suppliers send invoices to the customer showing the amount due for payment. These
invoices are used in the customer’s accounts department as the source of information
for liabilities. At the end of the month the suppliers send statements as a reminder of
unpaid invoices. Statements are useful as additional evidence of liabilities to suppliers.
Measurement of trade creditors is relatively straightforward because the company
will know how much it owes to short-term creditors. If it forgets the creditors, they
will soon issue a reminder.
Recording requires some care because omission of any credit transaction will mean
there is an understatement of a liability. In particular, the company has to take some
care at the end of the year over what are called cut-off procedures. Take the example
of raw materials provided by a supplier. The goods arrive at the company’s store by
delivery van but the invoice for their payment arrives a few days later by mail. The
accounts department uses the supplier’s invoice as the document which initiates 
the recording of the asset of stock and the liability to the supplier. In contrast, the event
which creates the liability is the acceptance of the goods. (It is difﬁcult for the accounts
department to use the delivery note as a record of the liability because it shows the
quantities but not the price of the goods delivered.) So, at the end of the accounting
year the accounts department has to compare the most recent delivery notes signed by
the storekeeper with the most recent invoices received from the supplier. If goods

Chapter 10 Current liabilities
279
have been received by the company, the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)
must include the asset of stock and the related liability. Using a similar line of reason-
ing, if a supplier has sent an invoice ahead of delivery of the goods, it should not be
recorded as a liability because there is no related asset.
The recording of purchases of goods for resale is shown in Chapter 6. In the illus-
tration of the process for recording the transactions of M. Carter there is a purchase 
of goods from the supplier, R. Busby, on credit terms. Payment is made later in the
month. The purchase of the goods creates the asset of stock and the liability to the 
supplier. Payment to the supplier reduces the asset of cash and eliminates the liability
to the supplier. The liability is described as an ‘account payable’.
10.7 Accruals and the matching concept
At the ﬁnancial year-end date there will be obligations of the company to pay for
goods or services which are not contained in the accounting records because no docu-
ment has been received from the supplier of the goods or services. It is essential that
all obligations are included at the ﬁnancial year-end date because these obligations fall
under the deﬁnition of liabilities even although the demand for payment has not been
received. The process of including in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)
all obligations at the end of the period is called the accrual of liabilities and is said to
reﬂect the accruals basis or accruals concept (see Chapter 4).
Definition
Accrual accounting depicts the effects of transactions and other events and circumstances
on a reporting entity’s economic resources and claims in the periods in which those
effects occur, even if the resulting cash receipts and payments occur in a different
period. This is important because information about a reporting entity’s economic
resources and claims and changes in its economic resources and claims during a period
provides a better basis for assessing the entity’s past and future performance than
information solely about cash receipts and payments during that period.5
The argument contained in the previous paragraph is based on the deﬁnition of a
liability, but some people prefer to arrive at the same conclusion using a different
argument. They say that all expenses of the accounting period must be matched
against the revenue earned in the period. If a beneﬁt has been consumed, the effect
must be recorded whether or not documentation has been received. This argument is
referred to as the matching concept.
In the Conceptual Framework, the IASB explains that in the income statement there is
a direct association between the costs incurred and the earning of speciﬁc items of
income. This process is called the matching of costs with revenues. As an example, the
expenses that make up the cost of goods sold are recognised at the same time as the
revenue derived from the sale of the goods.6
The accruals concept and the matching concept are, for most practical purposes, 
different ways of arriving at the same conclusion. (There are exceptions but these are
well beyond the scope of a ﬁrst-level text.)
10.7.1
The distinction between the expense of the period and 
the cash paid
A company starts business on 1 January Year 1. It has a ﬁnancial year-end of 
31 December Year 1. During Year 1 it receives four accounts for electricity, all of which
are paid ten days after receiving them. The dates of receiving and paying the accounts
are as follows:

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements

30 Sept. Year 1
280
10 Oct. Year 1
31 Dec. Year 1
340
10 Jan. Year 2
1,150
The company has used electricity for the entire year and therefore should match
against revenue the full cost of £1,150. Only three invoices have been paid during 
the year, the ﬁnal invoice not being paid until the start of Year 2. That is important for
cash ﬂow but is not relevant for the measurement of proﬁt. The transactions during
the year would be recorded as shown in Table 10.1. The arrival of the electricity
invoice causes a record to be made of the increase in the liability and the increase in
the expense (decreasing the ownership interest). The payment of the amount due
requires a separate record to be made of the decrease in the liability and the decrease
in the asset of cash.
The payment made to the electricity company in January Year 2 is not recorded in
Table 10.1 because it is not a transaction of Year 1. It will appear in a spreadsheet for
January Year 2. The totals at the foot of the spreadsheet show that the transactions 
of Year 1 have caused the cash of the company to decrease by £810. There remains a
liability of £340 to the electricity company at the end of Year 1. The proﬁt and loss
account for the year will show an expense of £1,150. The spreadsheet satisﬁes the
accounting equation because there is a decrease in an asset, amounting to £810, and an
increase in a liability amounting to £340. These together equal the decrease of £1,150
in the ownership interest:

That one needs a little careful thought because several things are happening at once.
You might prefer to think about it one stage at a time. You know from earlier examples
in Chapters 2, 5 and 6 that a decrease in an asset causes a decrease in the ownership
interest. You also know that an increase in a liability causes a decrease in the owner-
ship interest. Put them together and they are both working in the same direction to
decrease the ownership interest.
10.7.2
Accrual where no invoice has been received
Now consider what might happen if the ﬁnal electricity invoice for the year has not
been received on 31 December Year 1. If no invoice has been received then there will
be no entry in the accounting records. That, however, would fail to acknowledge that
the electricity has been consumed and the company knows there is an obligation to
pay for that electricity. In terms of the matching concept, only nine months’ invoices
are available to match against revenue when there has been twelve months’ usage. The
answer is that the company must make an estimate of the accrual of the liability for
electricity consumed. Estimates will seldom give the true answer but they can be made
reasonably close if some care is taken. If the company keeps a note of electricity meter
readings and knows the unit charge, it can calculate what the account would have been.
The entries in the spreadsheet at the end of the month are shown in Table 10.2. They
will be the same numerically as those in the ﬁnal line of Table 10.1 but the item shown
at 31 December will be described as an accrual.
10.7.3
The nature of estimates in accounting
Making an accrual for a known obligation, where no invoice has been received,
requires estimates. In the example given here it was a relatively straightforward 
matter to take a meter reading and calculate the expected liability. There will be other
examples where the existence and amount of an expense are both known with 
reasonable certainty. There will be some cases where the amount has to be estimated
and the estimate is later found to be incorrect. That is a normal feature of accounting,
although not all users of ﬁnancial statements realise there is an element of uncertainty
about the information provided. If a liability is unintentionally understated at the end
of a period, the proﬁt will be overstated. In the next accounting period, when the full
obligation becomes known, the expense incurred will be higher than was anticipated
and the proﬁt of that period will be lower than it should ideally be. If the error in the
estimate is found to be such that it would change the views of the main users of ﬁnan-
cial statements, a prior year adjustment may be made by recalculating the proﬁts of
previous years and reporting the effect, but that is a relatively rare occurrence.
Write down five types of transaction where you might expect to see an accrual of expense
at the year-end. Against each transaction type write down the method you would use to
estimate the amount of the accrued expense.

10.8 Liabilities for taxation
In the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of a company there are two main
categories of liability related directly to the company. The ﬁrst is the corporation tax
payable, based on the taxable proﬁts of the period, the second is deferred taxation.
Each of these will be discussed here. You will also see in the current liabilities section
of a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) the words ‘other tax and social secur-
ity payable’. This refers to the amounts deducted from employees’ salaries and wages
by the company on behalf of HMRC and paid over at regular intervals. In respect of
such amounts the company is acting as a tax collecting agent of HMRC.
10.8.1
Corporation tax
Companies pay corporation tax based on the taxable proﬁt of the accounting period
(usually one year). The taxable proﬁt is calculated according to the rules of tax law. That
in itself is a subject for an entire textbook but one basic principle is that the taxable
proﬁt is based on proﬁt calculated according to commercially accepted accounting prac-
tices. So, apart from some speciﬁc points of difference, the accounting proﬁt is usually
quite close to the taxable proﬁt. Assume that the corporation tax rate is 30% of the tax-
able proﬁt. (The tax rate each year is set by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.) Analysts will
evaluate the tax charge in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) as a percentage
of taxable proﬁt and start to ask questions when the answer is very different from 30%.
The explanation could be that there are proﬁts earned abroad where the tax rate is dif-
ferent, but it could also be that there has been some use of provisions or adjustments for
accounting purposes which are not allowed for tax purposes. That will lead to more
probing by the analysts to establish whether they share the doubts of the tax authorities.
Large companies must pay corporation tax by four quarterly instalments. A com-
pany with a year-end of 31 December Year 1 will pay on 14 July Year 1, 14 October
Year 1, 14 January Year 2 and 14 April Year 2. The amount of tax due is estimated by
making a forecast of the proﬁt for the year. As the year progresses the forecast is
revised and the tax calculation is also revised. This means that at the end of the
accounting year there is a liability for half that year’s tax bill. A ‘large’ company is any
company that pays corporation tax at the full rate. Small companies, which have a 
special, lower, rate of corporation tax, pay their tax bill nine months after the end of
the accounting period. The precise limits for deﬁning ‘large’ and ‘small’ companies
change with tax legislation each year. (You will be given the necessary information in
any exercise that you are asked to attempt.) Suppose the taxable proﬁt is £10m and 
the tax payable at 30% is £3m. During the year £1.5m is paid in total on the ﬁrst two
instalment dates. At the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) date there will
remain a liability of £1.5m to be paid in total on the ﬁnal two instalment dates.

QUESTIONS
The Questions section of each chapter has three types of question. ‘Test your understanding’
questions to help you review your reading are in the ‘A’ series of questions. You will find the
answers to these by reading and thinking about the material in the book. ‘Application’ questions
to test your ability to apply technical skills are in the ‘B’ series of questions. Questions requiring
you to show skills in problem solving and evaluation are in the ‘C’ series of questions. A letter
[S] indicates that there is a solution at the end of the book.
rules which allow companies to defer the payment of some taxation on the full
accounting proﬁt. (‘Deferring’ means paying much later than the normal period of
nine months.) The deferral period might be for a few months or it might be for a few
years. The obligation to pay tax eventually cannot be escaped but the liability becomes
long term. This is reﬂected, in terms of the accounting equation, by reporting the
decrease in ownership claim in the proﬁt and loss account but showing the deferred
liability as a separate item under non-current liabilities.
10.9 Summary
l A current liability is a liability which satisﬁes any of the following criteria:
(a) it is expected to be settled in the entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
(c) it is due to be settled within 12 months after the ﬁnancial year-end date.
l The risk of understatement of liabilities is that it will result in overstatement of the
ownership interest.
l Off-balance sheet finance means keeping liabilities (and related assets) off the
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet).
l There are some obligations of the company which fail the recognition test because
there is signiﬁcant uncertainty about future events that may cause beneﬁts to ﬂow
from the company. These are reported as contingent liabilities in the notes to the
ﬁnancial statements.
l Users need to know about the existence of liabilities, the amount and timing of
expected repayments and interest charges payable on loans.
l Under the accruals basis, the effects of transactions and other events are recognised
when they occur (and not as cash or its equivalent is received or paid) and they are
recorded in the accounting records and reported in the ﬁnancial statements of the
periods to which they relate.
l Liabilities for unpaid expenses are often called accruals.
l The matching concept is the idea that all expenses of the accounting period must
be matched against the revenue earned in the period. If a beneﬁt has been consumed,
the effect must be recorded whether or not documentation has been received.
l Companies pay corporation tax. The arrangements vary depending on the size of
the company but there will usually be a liability for unpaid corporation tax in the
current liabilities section of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet).
Where government policy allows payment to be delayed for more than 12 months
the liability is described as deferred taxation.

Activities for study groups
Turn to the annual report of a listed company which you have used for activities in previous
chapters. Find every item of information about current liabilities. (Start with the financial state-
ments and notes but look also at the operating and financial review, chief executive’s review
and other non-regulated information about the company.)
Divide into two groups. One group should take on the role of the purchasing director and one
should take on the role of a company which has been asked to supply goods or services to this
company on credit terms.
l Supplier group: What questions would you ask to supplement what you have learned from
the annual report?
l Purchasing director: What questions would you ask about the supplier? What might you
learn about the supplier from the annual report of the supplier’s company?

Bookkeeping entries for accruals
In the main part of the chapter the accruals for electricity were analysed. Now consider the debit
and credit recording. The following transactions are to be recorded.
A company starts business on 1 January Year 1. It has a ﬁnancial year-end of 31 December
Year 1. During Year 1 it receives three accounts for electricity, all of which are paid 
ten days after receiving them. The dates of receiving and paying the accounts are as
follows:
Amount of invoice
Date invoice received
Date paid
£

31 Mar. Year 1
10 Apr. Year 1
180
30 June Year 1
10 July Year 1
280
30 Sept. Year 1
10 Oct. Year 1
At 31 December the ﬁnal invoice for the year has not arrived because of delays in
the mail but the amount due for payment is estimated at £340.
Before you read further, attempt to write down the debit and credit entries for: each of
the three invoices received; the payments of those three invoices; and the estimated
amount due for payment at the end of the year. You may find help in looking back to
Tables 10.1 and 10.2.
Table 10.3 sets out the debit and credit aspect of each transaction and event. The
amount of the liability to the supplier cannot be recorded until the invoice is received.
The credit entry for the estimate of the amount owing to the supplier is therefore
shown in a separate account called accruals which will be the basis for the amount
shown in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) under that heading.
The ledger accounts required here are:

LEONA: The supplier’s account is showing a nil liability because all invoices received have
been paid. We know there is another invoice on the way but the bookkeeping system is
quite strict about only making entries in the ledger when the documentary evidence is
obtained. The document in this case is the supplier’s invoice. Until it arrives the liability has
to be recognised as an accrual rather than in the supplier’s account.

REAL WORLD CASE
SSE plc
Extract from Significant Accounting Policies (p. 106)
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning North Sea
exploration and production assets and certain generation and gas storage assets.
Estimates are based on forecast clean-up costs at the time of decommissioning discounted for the
time value of money. The timing of costs provided is dependent on the lives of the facilities.
(ii)
The Group hold provisions in relation to long-term construction contracts including streetlighting
PFIs. These relate to contract costs that are not guaranteed to being recovered under the
respective contracts.
(iii) The Group has recognised provisions of £37.4m in relation to onerous contracts in the year.
These have been treated as exceptional charges (note 5). These contracts will be settled in the
next year.
(iv) Other provisions include balances held in relation to insurance and warranty claims. In addition,
the Group has an employer financed retirement benefit provision for pensions for certain Directors
and former Directors and employees, which is valued in accordance with IAS 19.

11.1 Introduction
Supplement 7.1 to Chapter 7 sets out the information to be presented on the face of the
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of companies using the IASB system in
their ﬁnancial statements. The non-current liabilities listed there are item (k) pro-
visions, (l) ﬁnancial liabilities (where these are loans due in more than one year’s time)
and (n) deferred tax liabilities.
Supplement 7.2 to Chapter 7 sets out the information to be presented in the 
ﬁnancial statements of companies that are using the UK Companies Act and UK ASB
standards. There is one heading for non-current liabilities, with a detailed list below,
as follows:

Comparing Supplements 7.1 and 7.2 it could appear that companies using the IASB
system face fewer detailed rules. However, those companies still produce a great deal
of detailed information in practice because the IASB has other standards that require
more detail.
In this chapter we follow the pattern established in earlier chapters by asking:
l What are the principles for deﬁning and recognising these items?
l What are the information needs of users in respect of the particular items?
l What information is currently provided by companies to meet these needs?
l Does the information show the desirable qualitative characteristics of ﬁnancial
statements?
l What are the principles for measuring, and processes for recording, these items?
This chapter looks ﬁrst at provisions, then turns to non-current (long-term) liabilities
and ﬁnally covers deferred income. General principles of deﬁnition and recognition of
liabilities are dealt with in Chapter 10 and you should ensure you have read and
understood that chapter before embarking on this one. For convenience the deﬁnitions
from Chapter 2 are repeated here.
Definitions
A liability is a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement 
of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying
economic benefits.1
A current liability is a liability which satisfies any of the following criteria:
(a) it is expected to be settled in the entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
(c) it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period.2
A non-current liability is any liability that does not meet the definition of a current
liability.3 Non-current liabilities are also described as long-term liabilities.
11.2 Users’ needs for information
There are two aspects of information needed in relation to liabilities. The ﬁrst relates
to the amount owed (sometimes called the principal sum or the capital amount) and
the second relates to the cost of servicing the loan (usually the payment of interest).
Owners of a company need to know how much the company owes to other parties
because the owners are at the end of the queue when it comes to sharing out the assets
of the company if it closes down. Lenders to the company want to know how many
other lenders will have a claim on assets if the company closes down and how much
the total claim of lenders will be. They may want to take a secured loan, where 
the agreement with the company speciﬁes particular assets which may be sold by the
lender if the company defaults on payment.
Cash flow is important to a range of users. Interest payments are an expense to be
reported in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account), but paying interest is a
drain on cash as well as affecting the ownership interest by a reduction in proﬁt.

Activity 11.1
Chapter 11 Provisions and non-current (long-term) liabilities
293
Owners of the company want to know if there will be sufﬁcient cash left to allow them
a dividend (or drawings for partnerships and sole traders) after interest has been paid.
Lenders want to be reassured that the company is generating sufﬁcient cash ﬂow and
proﬁt to cover the interest expense.
Both owners and lenders want to see the impact of borrowing on future cash ﬂows.
They need to know the scheduled dates of repayments of loans (sometimes referred to
as the maturity profile of debt), the currency in which the loan must be repaid and the
structure of interest rates (e.g. whether the loan period is starting with low rates of
interest which are then stepped up in future years).
Finally, owners and lenders are interested in the gearing of the company. This means
the ratio of loan capital to ownership interest in the statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet) or the ratio of interest payments to net proﬁt in the income statement
(proﬁt and loss account). Chapter 13 will provide more detail on the calculation and
interpretation of gearing.
Imagine you are a shareholder in a company which is financed partly by long-term loans.
Write down the information needed by users in the order of importance to you as a
shareholder and explain your answer.

Finally, note 33 sets out contingent liabilities. (Contingent liabilities are deﬁned and
explained in Chapter 10.) Two contingent items have the amount quantiﬁed. The
impact of litigation (legal action) is not quantiﬁed. The company may think that to do
so would be seen as an admission of legal liability.
Note 33 Contingent liabilities
The company has guaranteed bank and other borrowings of subsidiaries amounting 
to £3.0m (Year 6: £15.2m). The group has commitments, amounting to approximately
£41.9m (Year 6: £28.5m), under forward exchange contracts entered into in the
ordinary course of business.
Certain subsidiaries have given warranties for service work. These are explained in 
the statement on accounting policies. There are contingent liabilities in respect of
litigation. None of the actions is expected to give rise to any material loss.

Chapter 11 Provisions and non-current (long-term) liabilities
295
The accounting policy statement contains three items relevant to liabilities:
Accounting policies
Deferred tax
The provision for deferred tax recognises a future liability arising from past transactions and
events. Tax legislation allows the company to defer settlement of the liability for several
years.
Warranties
Some service work is carried out under warranty. The cost of claims under warranty is
charged against the income statement (profit and loss account) of the year in which the
claims are settled.
Deferred consideration
For acquisitions involving deferred consideration, estimated deferred payments are accrued
in the statement of financial position (balance sheet). Interest due to vendors on deferred pay-
ments is charged to the income statement (profit and loss account) as it accrues.
In this extract the word ‘charged’ appears several times. In relation to interest 
or taxes, the use of the word charge describes the reduction in ownership interest
reported in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) due to the cost of interest
and tax payable.
Because the level of borrowing is low in this company, and therefore would not 
create any concern for investors or new lenders, the ﬁnance director has very little to
say about it in his report. To some extent the chairman takes the initiative earlier in the
annual report:
Finance
Once again, during Year 7 we had a strong operating cash ﬂow, amounting to £196.7m 
(up from £163.5m in Year 6). This funded expenditure of £24.6m on acquisition of other
companies and businesses (after allowing for £3.1m received from a disposal of a company)
and the group still ended the year with an increase in its cash balances.
David Wilson has already commented in Chapters 4 and 7 on some aspects of the
liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements of Safe and Sure plc. Here he is explaining to
Leona, in the coffee bar at the health club, his views on liabilities in particular.
DAVID: Where do I start in explaining how I look at liabilities? Well, I always read the
accounting policy notes before I look at any financial statements. This company provides
three accounting policy notes relating to matters of liabilities. The policy on warranties is
interesting because it confirms that the company does not record any expected liability on
warranties. The first time I saw this in the annual report I was quite concerned about lack
of prudence, but on my first visit to the company I was shown the warranty settlement file.
There are very few claims under warranty because the company has lots of procedures
which have to be followed by employees who carry out service work. Warranty claims are
relatively unusual and unpredictable for this company so there is no previous pattern to 
justify setting up a liability in the form of a provision for future claims.
The deferred consideration arises because this company has acquired another business
and wants to look into all aspects of the newly acquired investment before making full payment.
Deferred tax provisions are common to many companies. They are an attempt to line 
up the accounting profit with the tax charge based on taxable profits, which are usually 
different. I don’t understand the technical details but my test of importance is to look at 
the amount charged to the income statement (profit and loss account) for the year. It is less
than 1% of the profit after tax, so I shan’t be giving it much attention on this occasion.
Provisions for restructuring are my real headache. These are a measure of the costs
expected when the company plans a restructuring such as changing the management
structure with redefinition of the role of some employees and redundancy for others. It

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
296
sounds reasonable to give warning of what all this will cost but the standard-setters have
to be strict about the details because in the past the use of provisions has been linked to
some creative accounting in the income statement (profit and loss account). Do you know
anything about that?
LEONA: Yes. On the one hand, you would like to know that a company is prudent in 
reporting in the income statement (profit and loss account) now the likely losses which will
arise in future years because of a decision to reorganise. On the other hand, you would 
not like to think that a company has loaded the income statement with lots of bad news
this year so that it can make next year look much better when the results are published.
The accounting standard-setter has prevented companies from being excessively prudent.
I could explain more but not at this time on a Friday night. What do you see in the 
statement of financial position (balance sheet) and the other information provided by the
company?
DAVID: After reading and thinking about the items in the accounting policy notes I look 
to the breakdown between current liabilities and longer-term liabilities. I also look to the
amount of long-term finance compared with the amount of the equity holders’ funds. The
borrowings in this company are relatively low in relation to equity-holders’ funds, so there
is not a high financial risk, but I still want to look for unexplained changes since the previous
year. Again, there is nothing which springs to the eye.
The contingent liability note is usually quite interesting. One of my senior colleagues
says that you should start at the end of the annual report and read it backwards. Then 
you find the best parts first. The contingent liability note is always near the end. I would be
asking lots of questions about the forward exchange contracts, if I had not already asked
the financial controller. He confirmed in more detail what the finance director says rather
briefly. The forward exchange contracts are used as part of prudent financial management
to put a limit on any potential loss through adverse currency movements on transactions
in different countries.
LEONA: Much of what you say is reflected in what auditors carry out by way of analytical
review. What we don’t provide is a view to the future. What are your thoughts there?
DAVID: This is a cash-rich company and it has very little in the way of complicated financial
structures. For a major company that is probably unusual, but it means I can concentrate
on the operating aspects of the business and on whether it will continue to generate cash.
It uses cash generated to buy other businesses and expand further, but I wonder what will
happen when the scope for that expansion ceases. It is unlikely to be a problem in the 
near future because the company has a foothold in expanding markets in Asia. When that
scope for expansion comes to an end the company may have to start borrowing to finance
expansion rather than relying on internal cash flows.
11.4 Provisions
Making a provision is an accounting process similar to that of making accrual for a
known obligation.
Definition
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount.4
The distinguishing feature of a provision often lies in the larger element of uncer-
tainty which surrounds a provision. Such a provision will appear in the liabilities 
section of a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). (This book has already 
considered in Chapter 8 the provision for depreciation and in Chapter 9 the provision

Chapter 11 Provisions and non-current (long-term) liabilities
297
for doubtful debts. These are examples of what is regarded as an adjustment to the
reported value of an asset, rather than an adjustment for signiﬁcant uncertainty. They
are therefore reported as adjustments to the asset and do not appear in the liabilities
section.) The following are examples of provisions which may be found in the liab-
ilities sections of published accounts:
l losses on contracts
l obsolescence of stock
l costs related to closure of a division of the company
l costs of decommissioning an oil rig
l cost of landscaping a site at the end of the period of use
l warranties given for repair of goods.
Recording a provision is relatively straightforward. The ownership interest is
reduced by an expense in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) and a liab-
ility is created under the name of the provision:
Assets −Liabilities ↑
equals
Ownership interest ↓(expense)
When the provision is no longer required it is released to the income statement
(proﬁt and loss account) as an item of revenue which increases the ownership interest
and the liability is reduced:
Assets −Liabilities ↓
equals
Ownership interest ↑
The provision may also be released to the income statement (proﬁt and loss account)
so as to match an expense which was anticipated when the provision was made. The
effect on the accounting equation is an increase in the ownership interest – the same
effect as results from regarding the release of the provision as an item of revenue.
Of the topics covered in this chapter, provisions give the greatest scope for inter-
national variation in accounting treatment. In countries where the accounting system
and the tax system are linked, there may be speciﬁc rules about the level and nature
of provisions allowed. In countries that have a strong culture of conservatism (strong
prudence) the provisions may be used to understate proﬁt. The problem with such an
approach is that the unnecessary provision may then be released in a year when
proﬁts would otherwise be lower. This has the effect of ‘smoothing out’ the peaks and
troughs of proﬁt. The IASB believes that provisions should only be used under care-
fully deﬁned conditions. This approach also applies in the USA.
The IASB has proposed5 to change the description of provisions to become ‘non-
ﬁnancial liabilities’. It has taken longer than expected to bring this proposal to prac-
tice. The IASB: ‘Current projects’’ web page will give updates. The IASB has proposed
that any items satisfying the deﬁnition of a liability should be recognised unless they
cannot be measured reliably. Any unconditional obligation would be recognised so
there would no longer be a need to estimate the likelihood of the obligation being
implemented. Uncertainty about the amount or timing of the economic beneﬁts
required to settle the non-ﬁnancial liability would be recognised in the measurement
of the liability.
Example of a provision
During the year ending 31 December Year 5, a company’s sales of manufactured
goods amounted to £1m. All goods carry a manufacturer’s warranty to rectify any
faults arising during the ﬁrst 12 months of ownership. At the start of the year, based
on previous experience, a provision of 2.5% of sales was made (estimating the sales to

Activity 11.2
Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
298
be £1m). During Year 5 repairs under warranty cost £14,000. There could be further
repair costs incurred in Year 6 in respect of those items sold part-way through Year 5
whose warranty extends into Year 6.
Using the accounting equation, the effect of these events and transactions may be
analysed. When the provision is established there is an increase in a liability and an
expense to be charged to the income statement (proﬁt and loss account):
Assets
−
Liabilities ↑
=
Ownership interest ↓
(expense)
+ £25,000
− £25,000
As the repairs under warranty are carried out, they cause a decrease in the asset of
cash and a decrease in the provision. They do not directly affect the income statement
(proﬁt and loss account) expense:
Assets ↓
−
Liabilities ↓
=
Ownership interest
− £14,000
− £14,000
The overall effect is that the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) will report
an expense of £25,000 but the provision will only be used to the extent of £14,000, leaving
£11,000 available to cover any further repairs in respect of Year 5 sales. The repairs,
when paid for, decrease the asset of cash but are not seen as decreasing the ownership
interest. They are seen as meeting a liability to the customer (rather like making a 
payment to meet a liability to a supplier). The creation of the provision establishes 
the full amount of the liability and the decrease in the ownership interest which is 
to be reported in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account).

11.5 Deferred income
For companies located in areas of the country where there are particular problems of
unemployment or a need to encourage redevelopment of the location, the government
may award grants as a contribution to the operating costs of the company or to the cost
of buying new ﬁxed assets.
Consider the award of a government grant to a company, intended to help with 
the cost of training employees over the next three years. The asset of cash increases,
but there is no corresponding effect on any other asset or liability. Consequently, the
ownership interest is increased. The obvious label for this increase is revenue. How-
ever, the beneﬁt of the grant will extend over three years and it would therefore seem
appropriate to spread the revenue over three years to match the cost it is subsidising.
The accounting device for producing this effect is to say that the cash received as an
asset creates a liability called deferred income. This does not meet the deﬁnition of a
liability stated at the start of this chapter because the practice of deferring income is
dictated by the importance of matching revenues and costs in the income statement
(proﬁt and loss account). It is one of the cases where established custom and practice
continues because it has been found to be useful although it does not ﬁt neatly into the
conceptual framework deﬁnitions.
Example
A company receives a grant of £30,000 towards the cost of employee retraining. The
retraining programme will last for three years and the costs will be spread evenly over
the three years.
The income statement (proﬁt and loss account) will show revenue of £10,000 in each
year. At the outset the deferred income will be recorded in the statement of ﬁnancial
position (balance sheet) as £30,000. By the end of Year 1 the deferred income will be
reduced to £20,000. At the end of Year 2 the deferred income will be reduced to
£10,000. At the end of Year 3 the deferred income is reduced to nil. The accounting
records are shown in Table 11.2.
Where grants are received towards the acquisition of ﬁxed assets there is a similar
approach of spreading the grant over the period during which the company will

beneﬁt from use of the asset. Some companies show the revenue as a separate item 
in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) while others deduct it from the
depreciation expense. This is a matter of presentation which makes no difference to
the overall proﬁt. The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) treatment is more
controversial. Some companies report separately the net book value of the asset and
the deferred income. Others deduct the deferred income from the net book value of
the asset. This does not affect the ownership interest but shows a lower amount in 
the ﬁxed assets section of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). In con-
sequence, the user who calculates proﬁt as a percentage of non-current (ﬁxed) assets
or a percentage of total assets will obtain a higher answer where a company shows the
lower amount for net assets. Most companies report the asset and deferred income
separately, but some argue for the net approach which sets one against the other.
(Both methods are permitted by the international accounting standard and by the UK
national standard. There is a view that the net approach may not be complying with
the Companies Act 2006 and so relatively few UK companies have taken the net
approach.) The choice will be set out in the notes on accounting policies. This is a use-
ful illustration of the importance of reading the note on accounting policies.
Consider a grant received as a contribution to staff retraining costs over the next three
years. Write down three arguments in favour of reporting the entire grant in the income
statement (profit and loss account) in the year it is received and write down three
arguments in favour of spreading the grant across the period of retraining. Which set 
of arguments do you find more persuasive?
11.6 Non-current (long-term) liabilities
The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) requires a separate heading for all
liabilities payable after one year. Users of ﬁnancial statements need information about
when the liabilities will be due for repayment (the maturity pattern).
Users also need to know about the nature of the liability and any risks attaching to
expected outﬂows of economic beneﬁt from the liability. The risks lie in: the interest
payable on the loan; the currency of the loan; and the eventual amount to be repaid 
to the lender. Interest payable may be at a ﬁxed rate of interest or a variable rate of
interest. The currency of borrowing is important when foreign exchange rates alter.
Repayment amounts may equal the amount borrowed initially, in some cases. In other
cases there may be a premium (an extra amount) payable in addition to the sum 
borrowed. There are some very complex accounting aspects to reporting non-current
(long-term) liabilities, the technical aspects of which are well beyond the capacity of a
ﬁrst-level text, but they are all directed towards ensuring that liabilities are recorded
in full and the matching concept is observed in relation to interest charges.
Users want to know about the risks of sacriﬁcing particular assets if the loan is not
repaid on the due date. A claim to a particular asset may be made by a creditor who
has a loan secured on a particular asset or group of assets.
11.6.1
Recording and measurement
This section concentrates on the terminology of non-current (long-term) liabilities and
the general issues of recording and measurement that they raise. The basic feature of
non-current (long-term) loan ﬁnance is that it is:
l provided by a lender for a period longer than one year;
l who expects payment of interest at an agreed rate at agreed points in time; and
l expects repayment of the loan on an agreed date or dates.

Activity 11.4
Chapter 11 Provisions and non-current (long-term) liabilities
301
The names given to loan capital vary depending on the type of lender, the possibility
that the loan will be bought and sold like ordinary shares, the currency in which the
loan has been provided and the legal form of the documents creating the loan. Some
of the names you will see are: loan stock, debentures, bonds, commercial paper, loan
notes and bank facility.
l Loan stock. If a company shows loan stock in its statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet) this usually indicates that the stock is available for purchase and
sale, in a manner similar to the purchase and sale of shares in a company.
l Debenture. The legal meaning of the term debenture is a written acknowledgement
of a debt. This means there will be a contract, in writing, between the company and
the lender. The contract is called the debenture deed and is held by a trustee who is
required to look after the needs of the lenders. If the company does not pay inter-
est, or repay capital, on the due date, the trustee must take action to recover what
is owed to the lenders. Debentures may be secured or unsecured, depending on
what is stated in the debenture deed.
l Bond. The term bond has been in common use in the USA for some time as a name for
loan capital. It is now found increasingly frequently in the statements of ﬁnancial
position (balance sheets) of UK companies, particularly when they are raising ﬁnance
in the international capital markets where the US terminology is more familiar.
l Commercial paper, loan notes and bank facility. These are all names of short- to
medium-term ﬁnancing provided by banks or similar organisations. The interest
payable is usually variable and the loans are unsecured.
This is only a sample of the main variations of names given to loan ﬁnance. It is not
exhaustive because the name does not matter greatly for the purposes of accounting
records and interpretation. The essential information needed for the users of account-
ing information is the answer to ﬁve questions:
1 How much was borrowed (the principal sum)?
2 How much has to be repaid (the capital sum plus any additional interest charge)?
3 When is repayment required?
4 What are the interest payments required?
5 Has the lender sought any security for repayment of the interest and the principal
sum?
You will ﬁnd detailed notes to the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)
setting out the interest costs and repayment conditions for loans reported as liabilities.
11.6.2
Secured and unsecured loans
l Unsecured loan. An unsecured loan is one where the lender has no ﬁrst claim on any
particular assets of the company and, in the event of default, must wait for payment
alongside all the other unsecured creditors. If there is no wording to indicate that the
loan is secured, then the reader of ﬁnancial statements must assume it is unsecured.
l Secured loan. Where any loan is described as secured, it means that the lender has
ﬁrst claim to named assets of the company. Where a debenture or loan stock is
secured, and the company defaults on payment, the trustee for the debenture will
take possession of the asset and use it to make the necessary repayment. In the
event of the company not being able to pay all the amounts it owes, secured lenders
come before unsecured lenders in the queue for repayment.

maturities.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements

11.6.3
Loan having a range of repayment dates
When a loan is made to a business, conditions will be negotiated regarding the amount
and date of repayment. Some banks are willing to offer a range of repayment dates,
say any time between 10 and 15 years hence, with the company being allowed to
choose when it will repay. If the company needs the money and the interest rate 
is favourable, the company will borrow for the longest period allowed under the 
contract. If the company ﬁnds it no longer needs the money, or else the interest rate is
burdensome, the company will repay at the earliest possible opportunity. For state-
ment of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) purposes the preparer of accounts has to
decide which date to use as a basis for classiﬁcation.
The general principle is that if there is an obligation to transfer economic beneﬁts,
there will be a liability in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). Where
there is a range of possible dates for repayment, the maturity date will be taken as the
earliest date on which the lender can require repayment.6
11.6.4
Change in the nature of finance source
Some types of ﬁnance provided to a business may be arranged so as to allow a change
in the nature of the source during the period of ﬁnancing. As an example, consider the
case of convertible loans.
A convertible loan is a source of ﬁnance which starts its life as a loan but, at some
point in the future, may be converted to ordinary shares in the company (e.g. the
lender is promised ﬁve shares per £100 of loan capital). At the date of conversion, 
the lender becomes a shareholder. This kind of ﬁnancial arrangement is attractive 
to those providing ﬁnance because it provides the reassurance of loan ﬁnance and 
a payment of interest in the early years of a new development, with the option 
of switching to shares if the project is successful. If the project is not successful and 
the share price does not perform as expected, then the lender will not convert and 
will look for repayment of the loan on the due date. For the company there are 
some tax advantages in issuing loan ﬁnance. Also, the rate of interest required by
investors in a convertible loan is usually lower than that required for a straight (non-
convertible) loan because investors see potential additional rewards in the convert-
ible loan.
While a convertible loan remains unconverted it is reported as a loan. Companies
are not allowed to say, ‘We are almost certain there will be a conversion’, and report
the convertible loan as share ﬁnance from the outset. However, there is an awareness
that the eventual conversion will dilute the existing shareholders’ claim on future
proﬁts and so the company will report the earnings per share before and after taking
into account the effect of this dilution. Consequently, you will see ‘fully diluted 
earnings per share’ at the foot of the income statement (proﬁt and loss account).
11.6.5
Interest payable on the loan
Companies and their banks may negotiate a variety of patterns for interest payment
on loans. The pattern of interest payment might be based on a low percentage charge
in earlier years and a higher percentage charge in later years, because the company
expects that proﬁts will be low initially but will rise later to cover the higher interest
payments. For many years the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) would 
have reported the interest charge based on the amount paid in each year, but now 
the standard-setters require the interest charge to be reported as it would be if a 
compound interest rate were applied over the life of the loan. This is described as 
the effective interest rate.7

Chapter 11 Provisions and non-current (long-term) liabilities
303
Definition
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash
payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument.
The reasoning behind this approach is that, for purposes of reporting proﬁt, the
ﬂexibility of negotiation of interest payment patterns makes comparability difﬁcult to
achieve. The banks will, however, ensure that they receive the overall compound
interest they require and this gives a commercially relevant basis for comparability in
the matching of interest charges against the proﬁts of the period.
The general principle is that the amount shown as the expense of interest payable
in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) should be based on the compound
rate of interest applying over the entire period of the loan. This will not always be the
same as the amount of interest paid in cash during the period. The spreading of inter-
est charges over the period of the loan is an application of the accruals or matching
concept. As an example, consider stepped bonds and deep discount bonds.
Stepped bonds
A stepped bond is a form of lending where the interest rate increases over the period
of the loan. Take as an example a loan of £5m which carries a rate of interest of 8% per
annum for the ﬁrst three years, 10% per annum for the next three years and 13% per
annum for the ﬁnal four years. The cash payment for interest starts at £400,000 and by
the tenth year has risen to £650,000. The overall payments may be shown to be equiv-
alent to a compound rate of 10.06% per annum. Table 11.3 shows that the income 
statement (proﬁt and loss account) charge of £503,000 would start higher than the 
cash amount, £400,000. By the ﬁnal year the income statement (proﬁt and loss account)
charge of £517,000 would be lower than the cash amount, £650,000. The pattern fol-
lowed on each line of Table 11.3 is to start with the amount owing, add interest at
10.06% and deduct the amount of the cash payment, leaving the amount owing at the
end of the period which becomes the amount owing at the start of the next period. By
the end of the ten years the amount owing is exactly £5,000,000, the amount required
by the lender.
It may be seen from Table 11.3 that the expense charged in the income statement
(income statement (proﬁt and loss account)) has a smoother pattern than that of the
cash payments. Over the life of the loan the total expense charged must equal the 
total of the cash payments. The accounting processes for recording these amounts are
too complex for a ﬁrst-level course. The important point to note is that all companies
are required to use this approach in calculating the expense charged in calculating
proﬁt. The cash ﬂow implications of interest payments may be quite different and 
it will be necessary to look to the cash ﬂow statement for evidence of the cash ﬂow
effect.
Deep discount bonds
A deep discount bond is issued at a price lower than (at a ‘discount’ to) its repay-
ment amount. The interest rate (coupon) paid during the life of the loan may be very
low (a ‘low coupon’ bond) or there may be no interest paid at all during the period of
the loan (a ‘zero coupon’ bond). As an example, consider a zero coupon bond issued
at £28m with a redemption value of £41m in four years’ time. The cash payments of
interest are zero but the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) would show an
annual charge of 10% per annum (starting at £2.8m in Year 1 and rising to £3.73m by
Year 4). If there were no pattern of annual interest the entire discount of £13m would
be shown as an expense of Year 4, distorting the underlying pattern of trading proﬁt.
Table 11.4 shows the pattern of interest charges for the income statement (proﬁt and
loss account).

Activity 11.5
Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
304
In the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) the amount recorded for 
the liability will start at £28m and rise to £41m as shown in the ﬁnal column of 
Table 11.4, so that the liability at the end represents the total amount due.
A three-year loan of £100,000 will be repaid at the end of three years as £133,100. 
No interest is payable during the three-year period. The interest included in the loan
repayment arrangement is equivalent to a compound annual charge of 10% per annum.
Explain how this transaction would appear in the income statement (profit and loss
account) and statement of financial position (balance sheet) over the three-year period.

capital instruments being used to raise money for business. The reasons are complex
but lie in the need to provide conditions which are attractive to both borrower and
lender when they may be based in different countries and may have different per-
spectives on interest rates and currency exchange rates. This section explains the term
‘interest rate swaps’, which are increasingly used by companies, and takes an illus-
tration from a major company to indicate the variety of capital instruments (sources of
ﬁnance) in use. Detailed descriptions and discussion are beyond the scope of this text
but would be found in a ﬁnance manual.
Interest rate swaps
Suppose there are two companies, A and B. Both have identical amounts of loan
ﬁnance. Company A is paying ﬁxed rates of interest, but would prefer to be paying
variable rates, while Company B is paying variable rates of interest, but would prefer
to be paying ﬁxed rates. The reasons could be related to patterns of cash ﬂow from
trading, cash ﬂow from investments or beliefs about future directions of interest rates.
Whatever the reason, it would seem quite acceptable for them to swap (exchange) so
that A pays the variable interest on behalf of B and B pays the ﬁxed interest on behalf
of A. This type of arrangement has to be explained carefully because neither company
can escape from the legal obligation on the loans taken out initially. The explanation
will usually be found in a note to the accounts which gives information on the legal
obligation and on the actual impact on the income statement (proﬁt and loss account)
of implementing the swap.

Comment. The euro-sterling bonds and the loan stocks are reported at the amount due
for repayment at the end of the loan period. The euro-sterling bonds are loans raised
in the eurobond market, repayable in sterling. Those loans which have ﬁxed rates of
interest are indicated in the table by a ﬁxed percentage rate. Zero coupon means a zero
percentage rate of annual interest payable. That does not mean the company escapes
interest payment altogether. The liability on the zero coupon bonds increases by 10.85%
each year as indicated in the extract note at the foot of the table. It is presumably due
for repayment part-way through Year 3 since the liability shown at the end of Year 2 is
quite close to the £100m amount due (called the nominal value in the note). The remain-

11.7 Summary
l A non-current liability is any liability that does not meet the deﬁnition of a current
liability. Non-current liabilities are also described as long-term liabilities.
l Users need information about the principal sum repayable and the interest payable
during the lifetime of a liability. They also need to know the dates on which
signiﬁcant payments will be required (called the maturity profile of debt).
l Detailed information about non-current liabilities is found in the notes to the ﬁnan-
cial statements.
l A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. The amount of a provision
is reported in the liabilities section of a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet). Changes in provisions are reported in the income statement (proﬁt and loss
account).
l Deferred income arises where a business receives a government grant or receives
cash for goods or services before these are provided. The cash received is reported
as an increase in cash and an increase in a liability to represent the obligation to 
satisfy the conditions of the grant or provide the goods or services. When the con-
ditions are satisﬁed the liability is reduced and the ownership interest is increased
by recording the revenue.

(b) Because of the redundancy programme, some properties have become vacant. Provision
has been made for lease payments that cannot be avoided where subletting is not 
possible. The provision will be utilised within 15 months.
(c) There is a legal claim against a subsidiary in respect of alleged breach of contract. 
Provision has been made for this claim. It is expected that the provision will be utilised
within 12 months.

(Refer also to Chapter 10, section 10.3.2, on Contingent liabilities.)
Explain why each of the following is reported as a contingent liability but not recognised as a
provision in the statement of financial position (balance sheet).
(a) Some leasehold properties which the group no longer requires have been sublet to third
parties. If the third parties default, the group remains responsible for future rent payments.
The maximum liability is £200,000.
(b) Group companies are defendants in the USA in a number of product liability cases related
to tobacco products. In a number of these cases, the amounts of compensatory and puni-
tive damages sought are significant.
(c) The Department of Trade and Industry has appointed Inspectors to investigate the com-
pany’s flotation ten years ago. The directors have been advised that it is possible that 
circumstances surrounding the flotation may give rise to claims against the company. At this
stage it is not possible to quantify either the probability of success of such claims or of the
amounts involved.
Activities for study groups
Turn to the annual report of a listed company which you have used for activities in previous
chapters. Find every item of information about liabilities. (Start with the financial statements and
notes but look also at the operating and financial review, chief executive’s review and other
non-regulated information about the company.)
As a group, imagine you are the team of fund managers in a fund management company.
You are holding a briefing meeting at which each person explains to the others some feature of
the companies in which your fund invests. Today’s subject is liabilities. Each person should
make a short presentation to the rest of the team covering:
(a) The nature and significance of liabilities in the company.
(b) The effect on profit of a 10% error in estimation of any one of the major categories of liability.
(c) The company’s comments, if any, on its future obligations.
(d) The risks which might attach to the liabilities of the company.
(e) The liquidity of the company.
(f) The trends in liabilities since last year (or over five years if a comparative table is provided).
(g) The ratio of current assets to current liabilities.

In the main text of this chapter there is an example based on the recording of pro-
vision for repairs under warranty. The analysis of the transactions and events is set out
in Table 11.1. The ledger account will appear as follows:

LEONA: At the start of the year (or possibly in practice at the end of each month) the pro-
vision is recorded by debiting the profit and loss account (L2) and crediting the provision.
When the repairs are carried out there is a credit entry in the cash account (L1) and a debit
entry in the provision account. Nothing is recorded as an income statement (profit and loss
account) expense at that time. The overall effect is that the income statement (profit and
loss account) carries an expense of £25,000 and the provision account shows a potential
liability of £11,000 to cover any further repairs arising from work done during Year 5 (since
some of the goods sold will remain under warranty into Year 6).
Deferred income
In the main text of this chapter there is an example based on the recording of deferred
income arising under a grant. The analysis of the transactions and events is set out in

REAL WORLD CASE
BAE signals high-liability results season
BAE Systems produces enough high-
tech weaponry to overwhelm a
confederacy of banana republics. 
But none of its missiles can neutralise 
a final salary scheme that on Thursday
triggered a £1.52bn write-off larger than
its 2011 pre-tax profits.
This prefigures a slew of writedowns 
and contributions increases for many
companies about to report results. The
reason is that gilt yields, the risk-free
interest rates against which pensions
liabilities are indirectly measured, are at
rock bottom and unlikely to rise for
years.
BAE illustrates the problem nicely. It discounts pension liabilities using corporate bond yields that fell
about 10 per cent after inflation to 1.9 per cent last year in line with gilt yields depressed by investors’
flight to safety. This has contributed to a £2bn increase in the liabilities of a scheme co-funded by
Airbus to £23.3bn, against a £600m assets uptick.
The cost of dumping the final salary scheme would be far higher for BAE and other sponsors.
According to Adrian Hartshorn of consultancy Mercer, no insurer would take on the risks without 
a steep premium to cover solvency reserves.
BAE pushed the scheme’s write-off, including Airbus’s portion, through the sanitiser of
comprehensive income. This protected pre-tax profits, leaving the group with an absolute bottom 
line loss of £29m. Fair enough, perhaps, given that a deficit increase is a non-cash cost. But the 
extra £1.1bn in long-term contributions that BAE plans will be real, unless gilt yields rally.
So corporate pleas for twangier accounting standards will grow louder through the results season.
But deficits result partly from contributions holidays that lifted profits in the 1990s. And most
sponsors are cash rich. They should maintain down payments on promises to staff. The credibility 
of business needs bolstering, not eroding further.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements

12.1 Introduction
The ﬁnal element of the accounting equation has been reached. It was explained in
Chapter 2 that the ownership interest is the residual amount found by deducting all
liabilities of the entity from all of the entity’s assets:
Assets
minus
Liabilities
equals
Ownership interest
The terminology was also explained in Chapter 2. The words equity and net 
assets both appear in the press and in commentaries in connection with the ownership
interest. Equity is a word used to describe the ownership interest in the assets of the
business after all liabilities are deducted. This is also referred to as the net assets, 
calculated as the assets minus the liabilities.
The structure which has been adopted for Chapters 8 to 12 is based on a series of
questions:
l What are the principles for deﬁning and recognising these items?
l What are the information needs of users in respect of the particular items?
l What information is currently provided by companies to meet these needs?
l Does the information show the desirable qualitative characteristics of ﬁnancial
statements?
l What are the principles for measuring, and processes for recording, these items?
Each of these questions will be addressed in turn.
12.2 Definition and recognition
The deﬁnition of ownership interest was presented in Chapter 2 as: ‘the residual
amount found by deducting all of the entity’s liabilities from all of the entity’s assets’.
Because the ownership interest is the residual item of the equation, it can only
increase or decrease if something happens to an asset or to a liability. Recognition 
conditions are applied to assets and liabilities but there cannot be any additional
recognition criteria applied to the ownership interest.
Events which change assets or liabilities include:
1 Making a proﬁt (or loss) through the operations of the business – earning revenue
and incurring expenses;
2 A contribution of cash by incoming shareholders purchasing new shares;
3 Holding an asset which increases or decreases in value;
4 Holding a liability which increases or decreases in value.
Each one of these events is important to the users of the ﬁnancial statements and
affects the claims of owners on the assets of the business. Since owners are the user
group most interested in the ownership interest, this chapter will focus primarily on
the information which is helpful to them. Item (1) of this list, reporting a proﬁt or a loss
in the income statement through the operations of the business, has been dealt with in
some length in previous chapters. In this chapter we concentrate on item (2), the issue
of new shares, and on items (3) and (4), the events which cause increases or decreases
in assets and liabilities which are not reported in the income statement (proﬁt and loss
account). Items (3) and (4) are part of what is called comprehensive income (where
‘comprehensive’ means ‘including everything that creates income for the owners’).

Chapter 12 Ownership interest
315
12.3 Presentation of ownership interest
Chapters 7 to 11 have concentrated primarily on the limited liability company. For 
any limited liability company the income statement (profit and loss account) is the
primary ﬁnancial statement which reports the revenues and expenses of the business
that arise through operations.
The change in value of an asset or liability while it is held by the company gives
more cause for debate. If the asset has increased in value while still being held by the
company, then there may be an increase in the valuation for ﬁnancial reporting 
purposes. That is not a realised gain and so cannot be reported in the income state-
ment (proﬁt and loss account). There is another primary ﬁnancial statement which
companies must use to report unrealised gains. For companies using the IASB system
in their ﬁnancial statements, the unrealised gains are reported in a statement of 
comprehensive income. All changes in ownership interest, including contributions
and withdrawals by owners, are reported in a statement of changes in equity.
Example of an unrealised gain
A business buys a building at a cost of £10m. One year later similar buildings are 
selling for £13m. The business does not intend to sell but would like to report the
potential increase in the market value of the asset. Because there is no sale, the £3m
estimate of the increase in value is unrealised. It is not reported in the income state-
ment (proﬁt and loss account) but is reported in the statement of comprehensive
income.
The presentation of the ownership interest is therefore a potentially complex affair,
using more than one ﬁnancial statement. There is information about the current pos-
ition of the ownership interest contained in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet) and the related notes to the accounts. There is information about changes in 
the ownership interest in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) and the state-
ment of comprehensive income (statement of total recognised gains and losses). The
approach taken in this chapter is ﬁrst of all to ‘walk through’ the early years of oper-
ating a limited liability company and the various types of ownership interest which
arise.
12.3.1
Issue of shares at the date of incorporation
When the company ﬁrst comes into existence it issues shares to the owners, who
become equity holders (shareholders). The date on which the company comes into
existence is called the date of incorporation.
Each share has a named value which is called its nominal value. Sometimes it is
referred to as the par value. This amount is written on the share certificate which is
the document given to each owner as evidence of being a shareholder. Exhibit 12.1
shows the share certiﬁcate issued by a company which conﬁrms that J. A. Smith is the
owner of 100,000 ordinary shares of 25p nominal value each. This means that J. A. Smith
has paid £25,000 to the company and that is the limit of this person’s liability if the
company fails.
All share certiﬁcates are recorded in the share register by the company secretary.
The share certiﬁcate is a piece of paper which may be sold by the existing owner to
another person who wishes to become a shareholder. The person who wishes to
become a shareholder is often referred to as a prospective investor. That is not a legal
term but is a useful way of indicating a person who has an interest in ﬁnding out more
about the company, without having the legal rights of ownership. When the new
owner has acquired the shares, the term ‘investor’ may continue to be used as a

description which emphasises that this person now has a ﬁnancial interest in knowing
that the company is performing well.
The issue of 100,000 shares at a price of 25 pence each will collect £25,000 cash for
the company. The effect on the accounting equation is that the asset of cash increases
by £25,000 and the ownership interest is increased by £25,000.

For a company, the ownership interest created by the issue of new shares at their
nominal value is recorded as share capital.
Look at the financial pages of a newspaper. Find the daily list of share prices. What
information does the newspaper provide about shares in each company? Which of these
items of information would you expect to find in the annual report of the company? Give
reasons for your answer.
12.3.2
Buying and selling shares
The company itself has no concern about the purchase and sale of shares from one
owner to another, other than having to record the new owner’s name in the share 
register. The purchase and sale may take place by private arrangement or may take
place in an established stock market (also called a stock exchange) if the company is
a public limited company. If the shares are traded in an established stock market they
are called listed shares because the daily prices are listed on screens for buyers and
sellers to see. If there is high demand for the shares, their price will rise. If there is little
demand, the price will fall. The market price on any day will depend on investors’

expectations about the future of the company. Those expectations will be inﬂuenced
by announcements from the company, including ﬁnancial information but also cover-
ing a much wider range of company news. The expectations may also be inﬂuenced
by information about the industry in which the company operates. One of the main
purposes of a well-regulated stock exchange is to ensure that all investors have access
to the same information at the same time so that no one has an advantage.
12.3.3
Issue of further shares after incorporation
As time goes by, the company may wish to raise new ﬁnance and to issue new shares.
This could be intended to buy new non-current (ﬁxed) assets, or even to provide cash
so that the company may purchase the shares of another company and create a larger
group.
Although the nominal value remains the same, the market value may be quite 
different.
Example
Suppose a company has shares of nominal value 25 pence but ﬁnds that its shares are
selling in the market at 80 pence each. If the company issues 200,000 new shares it will
collect £160,000 in cash. That is the important piece of information for the company
because it can use the cash to buy new assets and expand the activities of the business.
The asset of cash has increased by £160,000 and the ownership interest has increased
by £160,000.
The accounting records are required by company law to show separately the nom-
inal value of the shares and any extra amount over the nominal value. The nominal
value is 25 pence and the total amount collected per share is 80 pence. So the extra
amount collected is 55 pence. This extra amount is called a premium (the word means
‘something extra’). So the £160,000 increase in the ownership interest is recorded as
two separate items, namely the nominal value of £50,000 and the share premium of
£110,000.

12.3.4
Retained earnings
Once the business is in operation it starts to make proﬁts. The income statement (proﬁt
and loss account) shows the proﬁt earned in a time period. This proﬁt increases the
ownership interest. The accumulation of past proﬁts in the statement of ﬁnancial pos-
ition (balance sheet) is called retained earnings. The retained earnings represent the
ownership interest in the net assets of the business. It is one type of reserve. At any
point in time someone could ask the owner ‘How much would you expect to receive
if this business were to close down today?’ The owner would look at the statement of
ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) and reply with the total of the ownership interest,
shown by equity share capital plus all reserves.
You should be aware that the reserves are given different names in different 
countries. In some there is a legally deﬁned reserve with a tax-deductible transfer to the

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
318
reserve from the income statement (proﬁt and loss account). It requires careful read-
ing of the ownership interest section of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet). An understanding of the changes in retained proﬁts is helped by reading the
statement of comprehensive income, explained in section 12.3.5.
12.3.5
Statement of comprehensive income
Look back to the accounting equation explained in Chapter 3. Section 3.4.1 describes
ownership interest as:
Capital at the start of the year
plus/minus
Capital contributed or withdrawn
plus
Proﬁt of the period
That chapter gives the simplest possible deﬁnition of ‘proﬁt’ as ‘revenue minus
expenses’. A broader deﬁnition of ‘proﬁt’ would be to say ‘any changes in assets and
liabilities other than those caused by capital contributed or withdrawn’. Chapters 9
and 10 have shown that many changes in inventories, accounts receivable and accounts
payable will lead to changes in revenue and expenses, reported in the income statement
(proﬁt and loss account). This section and section 12.3.6 of this chapter show that other
factors may affect the values of assets and liabilities.
The IASB wants to encourage companies to report all changes in assets and liab-
ilities, whatever the cause, in a statement of comprehensive income. The word ‘com-
prehensive’ means ‘including everything’. However, many companies would like to
retain the separate income statement as explained in Chapters 5 and 6. Consequently
the IASB allows a two-part approach:
1 A separate income statement
2 A second statement beginning with proﬁt or loss from the income statement and
incorporating other components of comprehensive income.
This two-part approach is used by many UK companies which report using IFRS. 
It is used in this chapter to illustrate the comprehensive income approach. Two 
examples are provided in the following sections. The ﬁrst is the revaluation of non-
current assets and the second is the reporting of changes in exchange rates of foreign
currency.
12.3.6
Revaluation of non-current (fixed) assets
Suppose a company buys a hotel costing £560,000. The hotel is run successfully for a
period of three years and at the end of that period a professional valuer conﬁrms that
the hotel, if sold, would probably result in sale proceeds of £620,000 because of the
change in property values and the reputation which the hotel has established. The
directors of the company may wish to tell shareholders about this increased market
value of the company’s non-current (ﬁxed) asset.
There are two ways of informing shareholders in the ﬁnancial statements. One is 
to continue to record the value at £560,000 (the historical cost) in the statement 
of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) but to include also a note to the ﬁnancial state-
ments explaining that the market value has been conﬁrmed as £620,000 by an expert.
That information would allow the investor to think, ‘That makes me feel better off by
£60,000.’

Activity 12.2
Chapter 12 Ownership interest
319
This feeling of investor happiness is surrounded by a note of caution, because the
gain in value is not realised. The asset has not in fact been sold in the market. It only
needs a rumour of pollution on the local beach to depress the market value of all 
the hotels in the town. Some companies feel that this note of caution is conveyed by
providing the information on the increase in value in the notes to the ﬁnancial state-
ments rather than the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) itself.
Other companies take a bolder view and decide that, in the interests of providing
information which is relevant to the needs of users, the company should apply the
accounting equation on behalf of the readers of the ﬁnancial statement. These com-
panies then have a problem of deciding on the name to be given to describe this
£60,000 increase in the ownership interest. It cannot be called revenue and included in
the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) because it has not been realised by the
operations of the business. It represents a new ownership interest as a newly identiﬁed
‘reserve’ of wealth. The wealth lies in the asset, but the interest in that wealth is a claim
which belongs to the owners. The increased wealth is caused by revaluation of the
asset, and so the name chosen for this claim is revaluation reserve. In terms of the
accounting equation there is an increase in the value of an asset and an increase in 
the ownership interest.

This section has explained the accounting processes for revaluing non-current
(ﬁxed) assets. You may see revaluation of non-current assets in some annual reports
of UK companies. It is not compulsory but if companies choose to revalue then they
must do so regularly as explained in Chapter 8. In contrast such revaluation is not
allowed in the USA or Germany. In other countries, such as France, it is allowed 
but rarely used. Revaluation is permitted by the IASB but is not a requirement. So
while the IASB system has brought standardisation of accounting practices across
Europe it does not entirely take away the choices that may make comparisons less
easy.
Example
A company, Ofﬁce Owner Ltd, is formed on 1 January Year 1 by the issue of 4m 
ordinary shares of 25 pence nominal value each. The cash raised from the issue is used
on 2 January to buy an ofﬁce block which is rented to a customer for an annual rent 
of £50,000. The tenant carries all costs of repairs. The company’s administration 
costs for the year are £10,000. At the end of the year the ofﬁce block is valued by an
expert at £1,015,000. On the last day of the year the company issues a further 2 million
ordinary shares at a price of 40 pence each, to raise cash in Year 2 for expansion 
plans.
For the analysis of each transaction you should look back to the previous sections where
each type of transaction is dealt with in detail. Write down the effect of each transaction
on the accounting equation. Check your answer against Table 12.1. When you are
satisfied that you understand Table 12.1 go to Table 12.2 where you will find the amounts
entered in the spreadsheet.

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
320
Entering the amounts in the spreadsheet of Table 12.2 shows, in the ﬁnal line, 
that the accounting equation is satisﬁed and allows a statement of comprehen-
sive income and a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) to be prepared as in
Table 12.3.

Suppose you note that a company has revalued its land and buildings as reported in the
statement of financial position (balance sheet). What evidence would you expect to see 
as justification for the amount of the revaluation? What questions might you ask about 
the basis of revaluation?
12.3.7
Changes in exchange rates of foreign currency
All information in the ﬁnancial statements of a UK company is shown in pounds (£)
sterling. Where exchange rates alter, a company may lose or gain purely because of the
exchange rate movement. That loss or gain must be reported.
The accounting process is called translation. Translation from one currency to
another is particularly important when the ﬁnancial statements of companies in a
group are added together and so must all be restated in a common currency. The word
‘translation’ is used because the process is comparable to translating words from one
language to another.
There are different methods of reporting depending on the type of transaction or
event. Two different stories are considered here. The ﬁrst is the purchase of an asset

located in a foreign country. The second is the purchase, by a group of companies, of
the share capital of a company in a foreign country.
Purchase of an asset
Take ﬁrst of all the example of a UK company which buys a factory in Sweden. The
factory is priced at Kr10,000,000. At the date of purchase of the factory the exchange
rate is Kr10 = £0.70. The UK company has agreed to pay for the factory on the day of
the transfer of legal title.
For accounting purposes the cost of the factory is recorded at the amount paid at
the date of purchase. This is calculated as:
× Kr10,000,000 = £700,000
The effect of the transaction on the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of
the UK company is:
Assets ↑↓
−
Liabilities
=
Ownership interest
Increase in asset of factory 
£700,000
Decrease in asset of cash 
£700,000
That is the end of the story so far as the UK company is concerned. The exchange
rate between the krona and the £ may ﬂuctuate, and this may affect the company’s
view of the price for which the factory might eventually be sold, but that information
will not appear in the ﬁnancial statements of the UK company until such time as the
factory is sold.
Purchase of shares in another company
Suppose now that a UK group of companies has decided to purchase the entire share
capital of a Swedish company whose only asset is the same factory. The purchase price
is Kr10,000,000. The Swedish company distributes its entire proﬁt as dividend each
year so that the only item remaining in its statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet) is the factory at a cost of Kr10,000,000. (This is a very simplistic example but is
sufﬁcient to illustrate the exchange rate problem.)
At the date of purchase of the investment, the factory will be recorded in the group
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) at £700,000.
Assets ↑↓

Chapter 12 Ownership interest

One year later the exchange rate has altered to Kr10 = £0.68. The factory is the 
only asset of the subsidiary. In the Swedish accounts it remains at Kr10,000,000 but,
translated into £ sterling, this now represents only £680,000:
× Kr10,000,000 = £680,000
This represents a potential loss of £20,000 on the translated value of the asset at 
the start of the year. The loss is unrealised but as a matter of prudence the fall in the
translated asset value should be reported. However, there have been strong feelings
expressed by companies over many years that the unrealised loss should not affect the
reported proﬁt of the period. Consequently the relevant accounting standard1 allows
the effect on the ownership interest to be shown in the statement of comprehensive
income as an increase or decrease for the period.
Assets ↓
−
Liabilities
=
Ownership interest ↓
Reduction in sterling 
Decrease in comprehensive 
equivalent of assets of 
income £20,000
subsidiary £20,000
The reporting of the reduction in the asset value as a decrease in reserves is con-
troversial because less attention is sometimes paid to reserves than is paid to the
income statement (proﬁt and loss account). This means that the impact on the owner-
ship interest may pass unnoticed. The IASB is hoping that the use of the statement of
comprehensive income will increase the transparency of such information.
This practice of translation is required by the accounting standard on the subject. In
group accounting there is considerable complexity to the technical aspects of which
exchange rate effects must pass through the income statement (proﬁt and loss account)
and which may pass through the reserves. The important message for the reader of the
annual reports is to be alert to the possibility of exchange rate effects on the ownership
interest being reported in reserves and to look carefully at the statement of compre-
hensive income.
12.4 Statement of changes in equity
In Chapter 7 it was noted that the IASB speciﬁes four primary ﬁnancial statements:2
1 a statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)
2 an income statement (showing the proﬁt or loss for the period), as part of a larger
statement of comprehensive income
3 a statement of changes in equity for the period, and
4 a statement of cash ﬂows.
The statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet), income statement and statement
of cash ﬂows were dealt with in Chapter 7. The statement of comprehensive income
has been explained in section 12.3.5 of this chapter. The statement of changes in equity
is now explained.
The IASB has decided that all owner changes in equity should be presented in the
statement of changes in equity, separately from non-owner changes in equity. The
detailed requirements are set out in IAS 1.
0.68
10

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
324
IAS 1 requires an entity to present, in a statement of changes in equity, all owner
changes in equity. As explained in section 12.3.4, all non-owner changes in equity (i.e.
comprehensive income) are required to be presented in one statement of comprehen-
sive income or in two statements (a separate income statement and a statement of
comprehensive income). Components of comprehensive income are not permitted to
be presented in the statement of changes in equity.
Dividends are distributions to owners in their capacity as owners. Consequently
dividends paid are reported in the statement of changes in equity. There will also be
a separate note on the dividend per share paid during the year.
The statement of changes in equity includes the following information:
l total comprehensive income for the period, showing separately the total amounts
attributable to owners of the parent and to non-controlling interests;
l for each component of equity, the effects of retrospective application or retrospec-
tive restatement recognised in accordance with IAS 8; and
l for each component of equity, a reconciliation between the carrying amount at 
the beginning and the end of the period, separately disclosing changes resulting
from:
(i)
proﬁt or loss;
(ii) other comprehensive income; and
(iii) transactions with owners in their capacity as owners, showing separately con-
tributions by and distributions to owners.
The term ‘components of equity’ includes, for example, each class of contributed
equity, the accumulated balance of each class of other comprehensive income and
retained earnings.
12.5 Users’ needs for information
The owners of a company, and potential investors in a company, are primarily inter-
ested in whether the business will make them better off or worse off. They also want
to be reassured that the business has taken care of the resources entrusted to it (carry-
ing out the function of stewardship). The ﬁrst source of an increase in the ownership
interest is the profit generated by the company. Professional investors will use the
phrase quality of earnings to refer to the different components of proﬁt. They tend to
regard proﬁts generated by the main operating activity as being of higher quality than
windfall gains such as proﬁts on the sale of non-current (ﬁxed) assets which are not a
regular feature of the company’s activity.
Owners of a company expect to receive a reward for ownership. One form of
reward is to watch the business grow and to know that in the future a sale of shares
will give them a satisfactory gain over the period of ownership. That requires a long-
term horizon. Some investors prefer to see the reward more frequently in the form of
a dividend. They want to know that the ownership interest is adequate to support the
dividend and yet leave sufﬁcient assets in the business to generate further proﬁts and
dividends.
Creditors of a company know that they rank ahead of the shareholders in the event
of the company being wound up, but they want to know that the company is gener-
ating sufﬁcient wealth for the owners to provide a cushion against any adverse events.
Therefore creditors will also be concerned with the ownership interest and how it is
being maintained or is growing.

Chapter 12 Ownership interest
325
Employees, suppliers and customers similarly look for reassurance as to the
strength of the business to continue into the future. The ownership interest is a con-
venient focus which summarises the overall impact of the state of assets and liabilities,
although what employees are really interested in is the preservation of the earnings
capacity of the business.
12.6 Information provided in the financial statements
In Chapter 7 the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of Safe and Sure 
plc was presented. The ﬁnal section of that statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet) presented information on the capital and reserves representing the claim of the
shareholders on the assets.

In the discussion contained in Chapter 7 it was emphasised that the most important
feature of this information is that, in total, it represents the shareholders’ legal claim.
There is nothing to see, touch, count or hold. If the company were to cease trading at
the date of the ﬁnancial statements, sell all its assets for the statement of ﬁnancial pos-
ition (balance sheet) amount and pay off all liabilities, the shareholders would be left
with £464.3m to take away. The shareholders have the residual claim, which means
that if the assets were to be sold for more than the statement of ﬁnancial position 
(balance sheet) amount, the shareholders would share the windfall gain. If the assets
were sold for less than the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) amount, the
shareholders would share the loss.
The total ownership interest is a claim which is described by this company as
‘equity holders’ funds’. It is equal to the net assets of the company. The total claim is
subdivided so as to explain how the various parts of the claim have arisen. This sec-
tion now considers each part of the claim in turn.

Called up means that the company has called upon the shareholders who ﬁrst bought
the shares to make payment in full. When a new company is brought to the stock market
for the ﬁrst time, investors may be invited to buy the shares by paying an instalment
now and the rest later. That was quite common in the 1980s when former nationalised
industries, such as electricity and water companies, were being sold to the private sector.
The prospectus, which is issued to invite the purchase of shares, speciﬁes the dates on
which the company would make a call for the rest of the share price due. After all the
cash has been received by the company, the shares are described as fully paid.
Ordinary shareholders are entitled to vote at meetings, usually in proportion to 
the number of shares held. That means that the power of the individual shareholder
depends on the number of shares held. For most large companies there are relatively
small numbers of shareholders who control relatively large proportions of the share
capital. A company which is part of a larger group of companies is required to report
in the notes to the accounts the name and country of the ultimate parent company.
Companies that are listed on the Stock Exchange are required to disclose in the direc-
tors’ report the name of any shareholder interested in 3% or more of the company’s
issued share capital.
Before the directors of a company may issue new shares, they must be authorised
to do so by the existing shareholders. The existing shareholders need to be aware that
their claim will be diluted by the incoming shareholders. (If there are 50 shares owned
equally by two persons, each controls 50% of the company. If 25 new shares are issued
to a third person, then all three have 33.3% each, which dilutes the voting power of the
ﬁrst two persons.)
One of the controversial aspects of share capital in recent years has been the 
privilege of share options taken by directors and other employees (usually senior
employees of the business but sometimes spreading to the wider employee range). 
A share option allows the person holding the option to buy shares in the company, at
any future date up to a speciﬁed limit in time, at an agreed ﬁxed price. The argument
in favour of such an arrangement is that it gives senior management an incentive to
make the company prosperous because they want the share price to increase above the
price they have agreed to pay. The argument against it is that they have no very strong
incentive because the worst that can happen to directors and other employees is that
they decide not to take up the option when the share price has not performed well.
Until 1995 there were also some personal tax advantages in taking options rather than
a normal portion of salary, but since then, the tax rules have limited such beneﬁts.
Major companies now disclose, in the directors’ report, the options held by each of
the directors.
The analyst’s view
David and Leona are on the plane ﬂying from London to Aberdeen for a week’s holi-
day in the Cairngorms. David has brought the annual report of Safe and Sure plc as a
precaution against inclement weather disturbing their plans for outdoor activities.

Chapter 12 Ownership interest
327
While they wait for lunch to be served, David turns to the annual report and ﬁnds it
is quite helpful to have Leona alongside him.
DAVID: At the present time nothing seems to excite more comment from the financial 
journalists than the salaries paid to the directors and the options they hold. I have to confess
that it’s something I look for in the annual report. Maybe I’m looking for my future earning
potential! One of my more cynical colleagues says that directors can’t lose on options. If
the share price rises they make money, which we don’t mind because our investment is
rising in value. What happens if the share price falls? The directors take new options at the
lower price and then wait for the market to rise again so that they make a profit! We can’t
do that for our investment.
I always look at the note on share capital to see whether new shares have been issued
during the year. It reminds me to find out the reason. In this case the increase is £0.1m and
the reason is explained in the accounts as being due entirely to the issue of options.
12.6.2
Share premium
It was explained earlier in this chapter that when shares are issued by a company it may
well be that the market price of the shares is greater than the nominal value. What really
matters to the company is the amount of cash contributed by the new shareholders,
but company law insists that the claim of these new shareholders is split into a nominal
amount and a share premium (the amount received in excess of the nominal amount).

DAVID: I look at the share premium account only as a check on the amount of cash raised
by issuing shares during the year. If I add the £3.0m shown in this note to the £0.1m shown
as an increase in nominal value, then I know that £3.1m was raised in total by the issue of
shares. I can check that in the cash flow statement.
12.6.3
Revaluation reserve
Earlier in the chapter the effect of revaluing assets was explained in terms of the
accounting equation. It was also explained that the effects of foreign currency
exchange rates may appear in reserves. The note to the accounts of Safe and Sure plc
appears as follows:

DAVID: I always look at the reserves note to see what is happening to the overall share-
holders’ claim. There is no change in the reserve during Year 6 or Year 7 so does that mean
the company has not revalued the non-current assets in that period?
LEONA: The directors are required to review the valuations at each statement of financial
position (balance sheet) date. So if there is no change in the revaluation reserve there must
have been no change in the value of the assets involved.

investments held in other currencies. In Year 6 the exchange rates worked against the
interests of equity holders but in Year 7 there was a favourable effect.

LEONA: Now you really can start to tie things together. The statement of changes in equity
shows changes during Year 7 in the lower part of the statement, with comparative figures
for Year 6 in the upper part of the statement. Starting at the top of the table we see the
amounts for the different components of equity at the start of Year 6. Share capital was
issued, increasing the nominal value and the share premium reserve. The comprehensive
income of the period increased the retained earnings. Dividends paid decreased the
retained earnings. That takes us to the start of Year 7 with an overall total of £370.4m. On
the next line we see that the new share capital issued is £3.1m which is a combination of
the increase of £3.0m in share premium (Note 13) and the increase of £0.1m in nominal
share capital (Note 12). That is really tricky to sort out from the Notes – it’s very helpful to
have the reconciliation give the information in one place. The comprehensive income is
taken from the statement of comprehensive income and is shown as increasing retained
earnings. The next line shows the dividend of £29.5m paid during Year 7. That dividend
relates to the profits earned in Year 6. For the dividend recommended in respect of Year 7

12.7 Dividends
Shareholders who invest in a company do so because they want the value of their
shares to increase over time and return greater wealth when eventually sold. In the
meantime the shareholders look for an income to spend each year. That comes to some
of them by means of dividends.
Companies are not obliged to pay dividends and may decide not to do so if there 
is a shortage of cash or it is needed for other purposes. The directors make a recom-
mendation to the shareholders in the annual general meeting. The shareholders may
vote against taking the dividend but that happens only very rarely. Final dividend
payments usually take place soon after the annual general meeting. Some companies
also pay an interim dividend during the accounting year. Major UK companies have
in past years ensured that a dividend was paid every year, however small, because 
it allowed the shares to be regarded as sufﬁciently ‘safe’ for investors such as trustees
of charitable institutions.
When a company decides it wants to pay a dividend, there are two essential tests.
The ﬁrst is, ‘Does the company have the cash resources to pay a dividend?’ The sec-
ond is, ‘Has the company made sufﬁcient proﬁts, adding this year to previous years,
to justify the dividend as being paid out of wealth created by the business?’
Even where the company has cash in the bank from which to pay the dividend, it
must look forward and ensure that there are no other commitments in the near future
which will also need cash. The company may decide to borrow short term to ﬁnance
the dividend. In such a situation the company has to weigh the interest cost of bor-
rowing against the risk of its shares being undervalued because of lack of interest from
shareholders. These are all problems of cash management (more often called ‘treasury
management’).
Company law imposes a different viewpoint. It takes the view that a company
should not return to shareholders, during the life of the company, a part of the capital
contributed by the shareholder body. Accordingly there is a requirement that divi-
dends must be covered by accumulated reserves of past proﬁt in excess of accumu-
lated reserves of past losses. It is not required that the dividend is covered by the proﬁt
of the year. A company might choose to smooth things over by keeping the dividend
reasonably constant even where proﬁts are ﬂuctuating.
The dividend declared by the company is usually expressed in pence per share.
Shareholders receive dividend calculated by multiplying the dividend in pence per
share by the number of shares held. For the company there is a reduction in the asset
of cash and a reduction in the ownership claim. The management of the company may
regard the dividend as an expense of the business but it is more properly regarded as
a reduction in the claim which the owners have on the net assets as a whole. The
reduction in the ownership interest is reported in the statement of changes in equity
because it is a transaction with the owners.

At the end of the accounting period the company will calculate proﬁt and then
declare a recommended dividend. The dividend is recommended by the directors to

the shareholders. The shareholders, in the annual general meeting, may accept or
decline but are not allowed to increase the amount. At the balance sheet date there is
no legal liability because the shareholders’ meeting has not been held. Therefore there
is no information reported in the ﬁnancial statements. The directors’ report, which is
required by company law, will contain a statement of the recommended dividend for
the year. There will probably also be information in the chairman’s statement or on a
‘highlights’ page.
12.8 Issue of further shares on the Stock Exchange
Once a company has a listing on the Stock Exchange it may decide to issue further
shares. There are different methods by which this may be done, depending on the
company’s motive for the action. This section describes an offer for sale, a capitalis-
ation issue and a rights issue.
12.8.1
Offer for sale
When a company seeks a listing of its shares for the ﬁrst time, it must offer those
shares to the public (using the services of a member ﬁrm of the Stock Exchange as a
sponsor) and issue a prospectus setting out information about itself. Some of the
information to be included in the prospectus is required by the Companies Act but this
is expanded upon by the Listing Rules. The prospectus is a highly informative docu-
ment, revealing far more about a company than would be found in the annual report.
There is a requirement for an accountant’s report which includes a three-year history
of the ﬁnancial statements. In particular, there must be a speciﬁc statement conﬁrming
the adequacy of working capital.
There may also be a forecast of the expected proﬁts for the next accounting period.
The reporting accountants will be asked to give an opinion on the forecast. Particu-
larly interesting are the assumptions on which the forecast is based. The reporting
accountants will conﬁrm that the amounts in the forecast are consistent with the
assumptions but the reader will have to decide how appropriate the assumptions
themselves are.
Exhibit 12.2 contains an example of a statement of assumptions taken from a 
company prospectus.
Exhibit 12.2
Assumptions on which profit forecast is based
The forecasts have been prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies
normally accepted by the Group and on the following principal assumptions:
(i)
there will be no changes in taxation or other legislation or government regulations 
or policies which will have a significant effect on the Group; and
(ii) the operations of the Group and its suppliers will not be significantly affected by
weather conditions, industrial action or civil disturbances.
You may be surprised to learn that the wording in Exhibit 12.2 is extracted from the
prospectus of a company retailing high-quality chocolates. You may be further sur-
prised to learn that very similar wording appeared in the prospectus of a company
offering dry cleaning services. There is no regulation which says that the statement of
assumptions has to be helpful to the user of the annual report.

Chapter 12 Ownership interest
331
12.8.2
Capitalisation issue
After the shares have been listed for some time, the market value may have grown to
the point where the shares are less marketable because the price of each is too large for
convenient trading in small lots. The company may decide to increase the number of
shares held by shareholders without making any change to the assets or liabilities 
of the company. One way of achieving this is to convert reserves into share capital.
Take the simpliﬁed statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) in Table 12.4. The
company decides to convert £1m of reserves into share capital. It writes to each 
shareholder saying, ‘You will receive one new share for each share already held’. The
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) now becomes as shown in Table 12.5.
The shareholder now holds twice as many shares by number but is no better or
worse off ﬁnancially because the total value of the company has not changed. The
shares will each be worth one-half of the market price of an old share at the moment
of issue. This process is sometimes referred to as a bonus issue because the share-
holders receive new share certiﬁcates, but in reality there is no bonus because no new
wealth is created.

Rights issue
Once a company has a market listing it may decide that it needs to raise further ﬁnance
on the stock market. The ﬁrst people it would ask are the existing shareholders, 
who have already shown their commitment to the company by owning shares in it.
Furthermore, it is desirable to offer them ﬁrst chance because if strangers buy the

Part 3 Recognition in financial statements
332
Activity 12.4
shares the interests of the existing shareholders may be diluted. Suppose the company
in Table 12.4 wishes to raise £3m new ﬁnance. It will offer existing shareholders 
the right to pay for, say, 2 million new shares at 150 pence each. There are already 
4 million shares of 25p nominal value in issue, so the letter to the shareholders will say:
‘The company is offering you the right to buy 1 new share at a price of 150p for every
2 existing shares you hold.’ Existing shareholders will be attracted by this offer 
provided the market price stays above 150 pence for existing shares. They may take up
the rights themselves or sell the right to someone else. In either event, the company
will receive £3m cash, the company will issue 2 million new shares at 150 pence each
and the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) will appear as in Table 12.6.

Buying back shares that have been issued
Companies are permitted to buy back shares that have been issued. The Companies
Act sets limits on the proportion of shares that may be bought back from existing
shareholders and sets conditions on the availability of retained earnings to support the
buy-back. Two possible reasons for buying back shares are (1) to return surplus cash
to shareholders and reduce the shareholding base, and (2) to stabilise share prices in
the short term where investors want to sell but for some reason there is a temporary
lack of demand in the market.
When companies buy back their own shares they may either cancel the shares or hold
them as ‘treasury shares’. Shares held as ‘treasury shares’ will be shown as a deduction
from share capital in the equity section of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet) and the transaction will be reported in the Statement of changes in equity.
Look in the financial section of a newspaper for the list of recent issues of new shares.
Obtain the address of one company from a trade directory and write politely to ask for a
copy of the prospectus. If you are sufficiently fortunate to obtain a copy of a prospectus,
look at the accounting information and compare it with the amount and type of
information published in the annual report. Why are they not the same?

Chapter 12 Ownership interest
333
12.9 Summary
l Ownership interest is the residual amount found by deducting all of the entity’s 
liabilities from all of the entity’s assets.
l Unrealised gains are reported in a statement of comprehensive income in the IASB
system. They are reported in a statement of total recognised gains and losses in
the UK ASB system.
l Each share has a named value when the company is formed. This is called its 
nominal value. It does not change unless the shareholders agree to split shares 
into smaller units.
l When the shares are sold on a stock market they have a market value. The market
value of frequently traded shares changes daily with the forces of supply and demand.
l The difference between the nominal value and the market value is called the 
share premium. When the company issues further shares at market price the share
premium is recorded separately from the nominal value.
l When non-current assets are revalued, the unrealised increase in value is added to
the revaluation reserve.
l Dividends paid to shareholders reduce the ownership interest and are reported in
the statement of comprehensive income. The effect on the accounting equation is
reported when dividends are paid. Dividends proposed to be paid in future are
described in the directors’ report.
l When a company issues more shares after incorporation it may be through a capi-
talisation issue, an offer for sale or a rights issue. A capitalisation issue gives more
shares to equity shareholders. It changes the relationship between share capital and
reserves but brings no new resources into the business. An offer for sale increases
the ownership interest and brings in new cash. A rights issue also increases the
ownership interest and brings in new cash but it gives the existing shareholders the
ﬁrst choice of maintaining their proportionate interest in the company.

The summary of the accounting records includes all transactions which have been entered in
the ledger accounts up to 31 December, but investigation reveals further adjustments which
relate to the accounting period up to, and including, that date.
The adjustments required relate to the following matters:
(i)
No depreciation has been charged for the year in respect of buildings, plant and machinery.
The depreciation of the building has been calculated as £2,000 per annum and the de-
preciation of plant and machinery for the year has been calculated as £55,000.
(ii) The company is aware that electricity consumption during the months of November and
December, Year 1, amounted to around £5,000 in total, but no electricity bill has yet been
received.
(iii) Overhead expenses include insurance premiums of £36,000 which were paid at the start of
December, Year 1, in respect of the 12-month period ahead.
(iv) The stock amount is as shown in the accounting records of items moving into and out 
of stock during the year. On 31 December a check of the physical stock was made. It was
discovered that raw materials recorded as having a value of £3,000 were, in fact, unusable.
It was also found that an employee had misappropriated stock worth £5,000.
(v) The company proposes to pay a dividend of £30,000.
(vi) The corporation tax payable in respect of the profits of the year is estimated at £45,000, due
for payment on 30 September, Year 2.
Required
(a) Explain how each of the items (i) to (vi) will affect the ownership interest.
(b) Calculate the amount of the ownership interest after taking into account items (i) to (vi).
(Hint: first calculate the profit of the year.)
Activities for study groups
Turn to the annual report of a listed company which you have used for activities in earlier 
chapters. Find every item which relates to the ownership interest (including any discussion 
in the non-regulated part of the annual report).
As a group, imagine you are shareholders in this company. You are holding a meeting of the
shareholders’ action group calling for clarity of information about your total interest in the busi-
ness. Make lists of the good points and weak points in the quality of information available to
you and then arrange the weak points in descending order of importance. Then draft an action
plan for improved communication with shareholders which you would propose sending to the
company.

Supplement to Chapter 12
A spreadsheet for adjustment to a trial
balance at the end of the accounting period
End-of-period adjustments and the ownership interest
If you look back to Chapter 6 you will see that it ﬁnished with a trial balance and a
promise that the trial balance would be used later as the starting point for preparation
of ﬁnancial statements. The moment has now arrived where the trial balance is used
as a starting point for making end-of-period adjustments to show the change in the
ownership interest during the period.
The accruals concept (or the parallel argument of matching in the income statement
[proﬁt and loss account]) requires all items relevant to the period to be included in the
ﬁnancial statements of the period. Most items will be included because they will have
been recorded in the ledger and hence in the ﬁnancial statements. However, there will
be some items of information, emerging from enquiry at the end of the period, which
have not yet resulted in a transaction but which are undoubtedly based on events 
relevant to the period.
The enquiry will take a routine form of:
l estimating the depreciation of non-current (ﬁxed) assets where this has not already
been recorded;
l examining non-current (ﬁxed) assets for signs of obsolescence beyond the amount
allowed for in the depreciation charge;
l counting the inventory (stock) of raw materials, work in progress and ﬁnished
goods, for comparison with the accounting record;
l evaluating the doubtful debts;
l checking ﬁles for any purchase invoices received but not yet recorded;
l checking ﬁles for any sales invoices for goods sent out but not yet recorded;
l considering whether any resource has been consumed, or service received, for
which a supplier has not yet sent an invoice.
Returning to the trial balance contained in Table 6.15 of Chapter 6, it may be noted
that the depreciation for the month has been charged, there are no trade receivables
(debtors) and therefore no concerns about doubtful debts, and it would appear from
the list of transactions for the month that all sales and purchases have been recorded
carefully. Suppose, however, that when M. Carter checks the inventory (stock) of
goods at the end of the month it is found that the roof has been leaking and rainwater
has damaged goods worth £500. Furthermore, the business uses gas to heat a water
boiler and it is estimated that consumption for the month amounts to £80.
These items of information are called end-of-period adjustments. Both events could,
and would, be recorded in the ledger accounts by the business. If you were presented
with this information as a class exercise, or you were the auditor taking the trial 
balance and adjusting it for this further information, you would use a spreadsheet
which set out the trial balance and then provided further columns for the end-of-
period adjustments. The spreadsheet for this example is set out in Table 12.7 but before
looking at that you should read through the next section which explains the recording
of end-of-period adjustments. In this case a one-month period is covered and so the
adjustments are referred to as month-end adjustments.

Analysis of the month-end adjustments
Before any entries may be made in the adjustments columns of the spreadsheet, the
effect of each adjustment on the accounting equation must be considered so that the
debit and credit entries may be identiﬁed.

The spreadsheet
Table 12.7 contains, in the left-hand pair of debit and credit columns, the trial balance
of Table 6.15 from Chapter 6. The next pair of columns contains the debit and credit
entries necessary for the end-of-period adjustments. The third pair of columns shows
the resulting amounts on each line of income statement (proﬁt and loss account) items.
The ﬁnal pair of columns shows the resulting amounts on each line of statement of ﬁnan-
cial position (balance sheet) items. The entire spreadsheet could be thought of as a
series of ledger accounts stretched across the page, with one line for each ledger account.
The debit and credit entries identiﬁed by the foregoing analysis are shown in the adjust-
ments columns of the spreadsheet with identifying letters in brackets alongside. Where
no suitably named line exists, a new line may be inserted. The use of a new line is shown
here for accruals and the expense of gas. If the exercise is being carried out using a
computer spreadsheet package, the insertion of an extra line is not a problem. For a
handwritten exercise it may be necessary to leave spaces at possible insertion points.
Once all adjustments have been entered, each of the adjusted amounts can be 
carried across to one of the ﬁnal four columns, depending on whether the item belongs
to the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) or the statement of ﬁnancial position

13.1 Introduction
Ratios are widely used as a tool in the interpretation of ﬁnancial statements. The ratios
selected and the use of the resulting information depend on the needs of the person
using the information. What investors really want to do is choose the best moment to
sell shares when the share price is at its highest. To choose that best moment, the
investors will monitor the company’s performance. Bankers lending to the company
will also monitor performance, and look for indicators of solvency and ability to repay
interest and capital.
Many users will rely on others to monitor ratios on their behalf. Employees will
look to their advisers, perhaps union ofﬁcials, to monitor performance. Small private
investors with limited resources will rely heavily on articles in the ﬁnancial sections of
newspapers. Professional fund managers will look to their own research resources and
may also make use of the analysts’ reports prepared by the brokers who act for the
fund managers in buying and selling shares. Each broker’s analyst seeks as much
information as possible about a company so that he or she can sell information which
is of better quality than that of any other broker’s analyst. There is ﬁerce competition
to be a highly rated analyst because that brings business to the broking ﬁrm and high
rewards for the analyst.
In monitoring performance the expert analysts and fund managers will use ratios
rather than absolute amounts. A ﬁgure of £100m for sales (revenue) means nothing in
isolation. The reader who knows that last year’s sales (revenue) amounted to £90m
sees immediately an increase of 11.1%. The reader who knows that ﬁxed (non-current)
assets remained constant at £75m knows that the ﬁxed (non-current) assets this year
have earned their value in sales (revenue) 1.33 times (100/75 = 1.33) whereas last year
they earned their value in sales (revenue) 1.2 times (90/75 = 1.2). Ratios show changes
in relationships of ﬁgures which start to create a story and start to generate questions.
They do not provide answers.
The fund managers and analysts all have their own systems for calculating ratios
and some keep these a carefully guarded secret so that each may hopefully see an
important clue before the next person does so. That means there is no standard system
of ratio analysis. There are, however, several which are used frequently. A selection of
these will be used here as a basic framework for analysis. As you start to read more
about company accounts you will ﬁnd other ratios used but you should discover that
those are largely reﬁnements of the structure presented here.
13.2 A note on terminology
Ratio analysis is not a standardised exercise. It is often taught in ﬁnance courses and
management accounting courses as well as in ﬁnancial accounting courses. Businesses
use ratios to describe their own performance. There is a tendency towards creating
ratios that suit the purpose and towards using descriptions that are personal choices
of the presenter. This chapter gives commonly used names for ratios (such as ‘gross
proﬁt percentage’) and links these to the terminology of the IASB system of account-
ing by using additional descriptions in brackets. For example, the title ‘gross proﬁt
percentage’ is used as a name for a ratio and it is deﬁned as follows:
× 100%
In the denominator of this ratio the word ‘sales’ describes the activity that creates gross
proﬁt; the additional word (revenue) in brackets reminds you that the information will
be found in ﬁnancial statements under ‘revenue’. Similarly ‘ﬁxed assets (non-current
Gross proﬁt
Sales (revenue)

Chapter 13 Ratio analysis
347
assets)’ uses the commonly established words ‘ﬁxed assets’ with the addition of (non-
current assets) in brackets to remind you of where the information will be found in the
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet).
13.3 Systematic approach to ratio analysis
A systematic approach to ratio analysis seeks to establish a broad picture ﬁrst of all,
and then break that broad picture down until there are thumbnail sketches of interest-
ing areas. Four key headings commonly encountered in ratio analysis are:
1 Investor ratios. Ratios in this category provide some measure of how the price of a share
in the stock market compares to key indicators of the performance of the company.
2 Analysis of management performance. Ratios in this category indicate how well the com-
pany is being run in terms of using assets to generate sales (revenue) and how effec-
tive it is in controlling costs and producing proﬁt based on goods and services sold.
3 Liquidity and current assets. The management of cash and current assets and the
preservation of an adequate, but not excessive, level of liquidity is an essential feature
of business survival especially in difﬁcult economic circumstances.
4 Gearing (referred to in American texts as ‘leverage’). Gearing is a measure of the extent
to which there is ﬁnancial risk indicated in the statement of ﬁnancial position 
(balance sheet) and in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) (see section 13.4
on risk and return). Financial risk means the risk associated with having to pay
interest and having an obligation to repay a loan.
In the following sections key ratios for each of these aspects of a systematic analysis
are speciﬁed by the name of the ratio and the deﬁnition in words. Below each deﬁ-
nition there is a brief discussion of the meaning and interpretation of the ratio.
13.3.1
Investor ratios
Investors who buy shares in a company want to be able to compare the beneﬁt from
the investment with the amount they have paid, or intend to pay, for their shares.
There are two measures of beneﬁt to the investors. One is the proﬁt of the period (usu-
ally given the name earnings when referring to the proﬁt available for equity holders
(ordinary shareholders)). The other is the dividend which is an amount of cash that is
paid to the shareholders. Proﬁt indicates wealth created by the business. That wealth
may be accumulated in the business or else paid out in the form of dividend. Four
ratios are presented with a comment on each.
Earnings per share
Comment. Earnings per share is the most frequently quoted measure of company per-
formance and progress. The percentage change from year to year should be monitored
for the trend. Criticisms are that this strong focus on annual earnings may cause
‘short-termism’ among investors and among company managers. The IASB would
like to turn the attention of preparers and users of accounts away from reliance on
earnings per share as a single performance measure, but the earnings per share remains
a strong feature of comments on company results.
You may also see ‘fully diluted earnings per share’. This is explained in section 11.6.4.
Price–earnings ratio
Share price

Proﬁt after tax for ordinary equity holders
Number of issued ordinary shares

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
348
Comment. The price–earnings ratio (often abbreviated to ‘p/e ratio’) compares the
amount invested in one share with the earnings per share. It may be interpreted as the
number of years for which the currently reported proﬁt is represented by the current
share price. The p/e ratio reﬂects the market’s conﬁdence in future prospects of the
company. The higher the ratio, the longer is the period for which the market believes
the current level of earnings may be sustained.
In order to gain some feeling for the relative magnitude of the p/e ratio of any indi-
vidual company, it should be compared with the average p/e ratio for the industry,
given daily in the Financial Times. The p/e ratio is quite commonly used as a key item
of input information in investment decisions or recommendations.
Dividend per share
Comment. The dividend per share is one of the key measures announced by the com-
pany at the end of the ﬁnancial year (and sometimes as an interim dividend during the
year as well). Shareholders immediately know how much to expect in total dividend,
depending on the number of shares held. The ﬁgure of dividend per share is the cash
amount paid by the company. It may or may not be subject to tax in the hands of the
recipient, depending on whether or not the recipient is a taxpayer.
The dividend of the period is equal to any interim dividend paid plus the ﬁnal rec-
ommended dividend (see section 12.7). To ﬁnd the recommended dividend you will
have to look beyond the ﬁnancial statements. The Directors’ Report will contain a note
on the recommended dividend which is to be paid to shareholders following their
agreement at the annual general meeting. There may also be a description of the rec-
ommended dividend in the Chairman’s Statement, or a Highlights Statement, or the
Operating and Financial Review (OFR).
Dividend cover (payout ratio)
Also calculated as
Comment. Companies need cash to enable them to pay dividends. For most companies
the proﬁts of the business must generate that cash, so the dividend decision could be
regarded as a two-stage question. The ﬁrst part is, ‘Have we made sufﬁcient proﬁts?’
and the second stage is, ‘Has that proﬁt generated cash which is not needed for rein-
vestment in ﬁxed or current assets?’ The dividend cover helps in answering the ﬁrst of
these questions. It shows the number of times the dividend has been covered by the
proﬁts (earnings) of this year. It could be said that the higher the dividend cover, the
‘safer’ is the dividend. On the other hand, it could be argued that a high dividend
cover means that the company is keeping new wealth to itself, perhaps to be used in
buying new assets, rather than dividing it among the shareholders.
The dividend policy of the company is a major decision for the board of directors.
Many companies like to keep to a ‘target’ dividend cover with only minor ﬂuctuations
from one year to the next. The evidence from ﬁnance research is that company man-
agers have two targets, one being the stability of the dividend cover but the other
being a desire to see the dividend per share increase, or at least remain stationary,
rather than decrease. Dividends are thought to carry a signal to the market of the
strength and stability of the company.

Comment. The dividend yield is a very simple ratio comparing dividend per share with
the current market price of a share. It indicates the relationship between what the
investor can expect to receive from the shares and the amount which is invested in the
shares. Many investors need income from investments and the dividend yield is an
important factor in their decision to invest in, or remain in, a company. It has to be
noted that dividends are not the only beneﬁt from share ownership. Section 13.4 on
risk and return presents a formula for return (yield) which takes into account the
growth in share price as well as the dividend paid. Investors buy shares in expectation
of an increase in the share price. The directors of many companies would take the view
that the dividend yield should be adequate to provide an investment income, but it is
the wealth arising from retained proﬁts that is used for investment in new assets
which in turn generate growth in future proﬁts.
13.3.2
Analysis of management performance
Management of a business is primarily a function requiring stewardship, meaning
careful use of resources for the beneﬁt of the owners. There are two central questions
to test this use of resources:
1 How well did the management make use of the investment in assets to create sales
(revenue)?
2 How carefully did the management control costs so as to maximise the proﬁt
derived from the sales (revenue)?
Return on shareholders’ equity
× 100%
Comment. A key measure of success, from the viewpoint of shareholders, is the success
of the company in using the funds provided by shareholders to generate proﬁt. That
proﬁt will provide new wealth to cover their dividend and to ﬁnance future expansion
of the business. The return on shareholders’ equity is therefore a measure of company
performance from the shareholders’ perspective. It is essential in this calculation to
use the proﬁt for ordinary equity holders, which is the proﬁt after interest charges 
and after tax. The formula uses the phrase equity holders which will probably be the
wording that you see in the ﬁnancial statements. It has the same meaning as ordinary
shareholders.
Return on capital employed
× 100%
Return on capital employed
× 100%
Comment. Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a broader measure than return on
shareholders’ equity. ROCE measures the performance of a company as a whole in using
all sources of long-term ﬁnance. Proﬁt before interest and tax is used in the numerator
as a measure of operating results. It is sometime called ‘earnings before interest and
tax’ and is abbreviated to EBIT. Return on capital employed is often seen as a measure
of management efﬁciency. The denominator can be written in two ways, as shown in
the alternative formulae. Think about the accounting equation and rearrange it to read:
Total assets −current liabilities = Ordinary share capital plus
reserves plus long-term loans
Operating profit (before interest and tax)
Ordinary share capital + reserves + long-term loans
Operating profit (before interest and tax)
Total assets −Current liabilities
Profit after tax for ordinary equity holders
Share capital + Reserves 

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
350
The ratio is a measure of how well the long-term ﬁnance is being used to generate
operating proﬁts.
Return on total assets
× 100%
Comment. Calculating the return on total assets is another variation on measuring
how well the assets of the business are used to generate operating proﬁt before
deducting interest and tax.
× 100%
Comment. The ratio of operating proﬁt as a percentage of sales (revenue) is also
referred to as the operating margin. The aim of many successful business managers is
to make the margin as high as possible. The margin reﬂects the degree of competitive-
ness in the market, the economic situation, the ability to differentiate products and the
ability to control expenses. At the end of this section it is shown that companies are
not obliged to seek high margins. Some cannot, because of strong competitive factors.
Yet they still make a satisfactory return on capital employed by making efﬁcient use
of the equipment held as ﬁxed (non-current) assets.
Gross profit percentage
× 100%
Comment. The gross proﬁt as a percentage of sales (revenue) is also referred to as 
the gross margin. It has been seen in earlier chapters that the gross proﬁt is equal to
sales (revenue) minus all cost of sales. That gross proﬁt may be compared with sales
(revenue) as shown above. The gross proﬁt percentage concentrates on costs of making
goods and services ready for sale. Small changes in this ratio can be highly signiﬁcant.
There tends to be a view that there is a ‘normal’ value for the industry or for the product
that may be used as a benchmark against which to measure a company’s performance.
Because it is such a sensitive measure, many companies try to keep secret from their
competitors and customers the detailed breakdown of gross proﬁt for each product
line or area of activity. Companies do not want to give competitors any clues on how
much to undercut prices and do not want to give customers a chance to complain
about excessive proﬁts.
Total assets usage
Comment. Total assets usage indicates how well a company has used its ﬁxed and
current assets to generate sales (revenue). Such a ratio is probably most useful as an
indication of trends over a period of years. There is no particular value which is too
high or too low but a sudden change would prompt the observer to ask questions.
Comment. Fixed assets usage is a similar measure of usage, but one which concentrates
on the productive capacity as measured by non-current (ﬁxed) assets, indicates how
successful the company is in generating sales (revenue) from ﬁxed assets (non-current

assets). The ratio may be interpreted as showing how many £s of sales (revenue) have
been generated by each £ of ﬁxed assets. The ratio is usually based on the amount of
property, plant and equipment.
13.3.3
Liquidity and working capital
Liquidity is a word which refers to the availability of cash in the near future after taking
account of immediate ﬁnancial commitments. Cash in the near future will be available
from bank deposits, cash released by sale of stocks and cash collected from customers.
Immediate ﬁnancial commitments are shown in current liabilities. The ﬁrst ratio of 
liquidity is therefore a simple comparison of current assets with current liabilities.
Current ratio
Current assets:Current liabilities
Comment. If the current assets amount to £20m and the current liabilities amount to
£10m the company is said, in words, to have ‘a current ratio of 2 to 1’. Some commen-
tators abbreviate this by saying ‘the current ratio is 2’. Mathematically that is incorrect
wording but the listener is expected to know that the words ‘to 1’ have been omitted
from the end of the sentence.
The current ratio indicates the extent to which short-term assets are available to
meet short-term liabilities. A current ratio of 2:1 is regarded, broadly speaking, as
being a reasonable order of magnitude. As with other ratios, there is no ‘best’ answer
for any particular company and it is the trend in this ratio which is more important. If
the ratio is worsening over time, and especially if it falls to less than 1:1, the observer
would look closely at the cash ﬂow. A company can survive provided it can meet its
obligations as they fall due. Some companies therefore operate on a very tight current
ratio because they are able to plan the timing of inﬂows and outﬂows of cash quite 
precisely.
Companies which generate cash on a daily basis, such as retail stores, can therefore
operate on a lower current ratio. Manufacturing businesses which have to hold sub-
stantial stocks would operate on a higher current ratio.
Acid test
Current assets minus inventories (stock):Current liabilities
Comment. In a crisis, where short-term creditors are demanding payment, the possi-
bility of selling stocks (inventories) to raise cash may be unrealistic. The acid test takes
a closer look at the liquid assets of the current ratio, omitting the stocks (inventories).
For many companies this ratio is less than 1:1 because it is unlikely that all creditors
will require payment at the same time. As with the current ratio, an understanding of
the acid test has to be supported by an understanding of the pattern of cash ﬂows.
Analysts in particular will often ask companies about the peak borrowing require-
ments of the year and the timing of that peak in relation to cash inﬂows.
× 365
Comment. The stock holding period (inventories holding period) measures the average
period during which stocks (inventories) of goods are held before being sold or used
in the operations of the business. It is usually expressed in days, which is why the
ﬁgure of 365 appears in the formula. If months are preferred, then the ﬁgure 12 should
be substituted for the ﬁgure 365. One point of view is that the shorter the period, the
better. An opposite point of view is that too short a period may create a greater risk of
ﬁnding that the business is short of a stock item.

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting

In calculating the stock holding period it is preferable to use the average of the stock
(inventories) held at the start of the year and the stock (inventories) held at the end of
the year. Some analysts use only the year-end ﬁgure if the start-of-year ﬁgure is not
available. Whatever variation is used, it is important to be consistent from one time
period to the next.
× 365
Comment. The customers’ (trade debtors’) collection period measures the average
period of credit allowed to credit customers. An increase in this measure would 
indicate that a company is building up cash ﬂow problems, although an attempt to
decrease the period of credit allowed might deter customers and cause them to seek 
a competitor who gives a longer period of credit. It is important to be aware of the 
normal credit period for the industry. Some companies offer discount for prompt pay-
ment. Any offer of discount should weigh the cost of the discount against the beneﬁt
of earlier receipt of cash from customers. When you are looking for information in the
annual report of companies using the IASB system you will probably have to start on
the face of the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) with the heading ‘trade
and other receivables’ and then read the corresponding Note to the statement of ﬁnan-
cial position (balance sheet) to ﬁnd the amount of trade receivables. If you are looking
at the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of a company that does not use
the IASB system you will have to ﬁnd the Note to the statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet) that gives detailed information about trade debtors.
× 365
Comment. The suppliers’ (trade creditors’) payment period measures the average
period of credit taken from suppliers of goods and services. An increase in this measure
could indicate that the supplier has allowed a longer period to pay. It could also indi-
cate that the company is taking longer to pay, perhaps because of cash ﬂow problems.
If payment is delayed then the company may lose discounts available for prompt 
payments. A reputation for being a slow payer could make it more difﬁcult to obtain
supplies in future. Some large companies have gained a reputation for delaying pay-
ment to smaller suppliers. Company law now requires company directors to make a
statement of policy in relation to creditor payment.
Companies do not usually report purchases directly, so the ﬁgure must be cal-
culated as follows:
Purchases = Cost of goods sold + Closing stock −Opening stock
Analysts often use cost of goods sold rather than calculate purchases, arguing that
stock levels are broadly similar at corresponding period-ends.
Stock (inventories) holding period PLUS
Working capital cycle
Customers (trade debtors) collection period MINUS
Suppliers (trade creditors) payment period
Comment. You saw in Chapter 9 (Figure 9.1) the working capital cycle whereby stocks
(inventories) are purchased on credit, then sold to customers who eventually pay cash.
The cash is used to pay suppliers and the cycle starts again. We can now put some tim-
ings into the diagram. The working capital represents the long-term ﬁnance needed to
cover current assets that are not matched by current liabilities. The longer the total of

the stock holding period and customer collection period, compared to the suppliers
payment period, the greater the need for working capital to be ﬁnanced long term.
13.3.4
Gearing
The term gearing is used to describe the mix of loan ﬁnance and equity ﬁnance in a
company. It is more properly called ﬁnancial gearing and in American texts is called
leverage. There are two main approaches to measuring gearing. The ﬁrst looks at the
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) and the second looks at the income
statement (proﬁt and loss account).
Debt/equity ratio
× 100%
* Where preference share capital is in existence.
Comment. From the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) perspective the
gearing measure considers the relative proportions of long-term (non-current) loans
and equity in the long-term ﬁnancing of the business. The precise meaning of long-
term liabilities will vary from one company to the next. It is intended to cover the loans
taken out with the aim of making them a permanent part of the company’s ﬁnancing
policy. As they come due for repayment, they are replaced by further long-term
ﬁnance. The starting point is the loans (but not the provisions) contained in the section
headed non-current liabilities. However, the accounting rules require separate report-
ing of loans due for repayment within one year, reported as current liabilities. It is 
necessary to look in the current liabilities for bank loans that are becoming due for
repayment. In some companies the bank overdraft is a semi-permanent feature and so
is included in this ratio calculation.
Preference share capital is included in the numerator because it has the characteris-
tics of debt ﬁnance even although it is not classed as debt in company law. The pref-
erence shareholders have the ﬁrst right to dividend, before the ordinary shareholders
receive any dividend. This is why they are called ‘preference’ shares. The amount of
the dividend is usually ﬁxed as a percentage of nominal value of shares. The amount
repaid to preference shareholders on maturity is the amount of the share capital only.
They do not normally take a share of accumulated proﬁts.
Some companies say ‘we have interest-bearing obligations such as bank overdrafts,
long-term liabilities and preference shares but we also have cash and cash equivalents
that are earning interest. We prefer to deduct the assets from the liabilities to calculate
the net debt’. An alternative form of gearing ratio is therefore deﬁned by calculating
net debt as all interest-bearing liabilities minus cash and cash equivalents.
Debt/equity ratio
× 100
Different industries have different average levels, depending on the types of assets
held and the stability or otherwise of the stream of proﬁts. A low gearing percentage
indicates a low exposure to ﬁnancial risk because it means that there will be little
difﬁculty in paying loan interest and repaying the loans as they fall due. A high gear-
ing percentage indicates a high exposure to ﬁnancial risk because it means that there
are interest charges to be met and a requirement to repay the loans on the due date.

Comment. The importance of being able to meet interest payments on borrowed funds
is emphasised by measuring gearing in terms of the income statement (proﬁt and loss
account). If the proﬁt generated before interest and tax is sufﬁcient to give high cover
for the interest charges, then it is unlikely that the company is over-committing itself
in its borrowing. If the interest cover is falling or is low, then there may be increasing
cause for concern.

13.4 Investors’ views on risk and return
Uncertainty about the future means that all investments contain an element of risk. For
investors who are averse to risk, there is a fear of income falling below an acceptable
level and a fear of losing the capital invested in the company. Given a choice between
two investments offering the same expected return, risk-averse investors will choose
the least risky investment.
13.4.1
Return
The word return has many meanings but for an investor the basic question is, ‘What have
I gained from owning these shares?’ One simple formula which answers that question is:

Investors in a company which is in a low-risk industry may be willing to accept a
low rate of return. Investors in a company which is in a high-risk industry will be seek-
ing a higher rate of return to compensate for the additional risk they take.
Research has shown that share prices react very rapidly to any item of information
which is sufﬁciently important to affect investors’ decisions. This phenomenon is some-
times referred to as the efﬁcient markets hypothesis, which is a statement that share
prices react immediately to make allowance for each new item of information made
available. The annual results of a listed company are announced through the Stock
Exchange by means of a document called a preliminary announcement, issued approxi-
mately two months after the accounting year-end. The annual report then goes to the
printers and is distributed to shareholders about three months after the related year-end.
When investors evaluate share price by calculating return, they take the most up-
to-date price available.
13.4.2
Risk
There are two main types of risk: operating risk and ﬁnancial risk.
Operating risk exists where there are factors which could cause sales (revenue) to
ﬂuctuate or cause costs to increase. Companies are particularly vulnerable to operat-
ing risk when they have a relatively high level of ﬁxed operating costs. These ﬁxed
costs are incurred independently of the level of activity. If sales (revenue) fall, or the
direct costs of sales increase, the ﬁxed costs become a greater burden on proﬁt.
Financial risk exists where the company has loan ﬁnance, especially long-term loan
ﬁnance where the company cannot relinquish its commitment. Loan ﬁnance carries an
(Market price of share today – Price paid for share) + Dividends received

Chapter 13 Ratio analysis
355
obligation to pay interest charges and these create a problem similar to the ﬁxed costs
problem. If the sales (revenue) are strong and the direct costs of sales are well under
control, then interest charges will not be a problem. If sales (revenue) fall, or the direct
costs of sales rise, then a company may ﬁnd that it does not have the cash resources to
meet the interest payments as they fall due. Repaying the loan could become an even
greater worry.
Both operating risk and ﬁnancial risk are important to the company’s shareholders
because they have the residual claim on assets after all liabilities are met. If the com-
pany’s assets are growing then these risks will not pose a problem but if the business
becomes slack then the combination of high ﬁxed operating costs and high interest
charges could be disastrous. As a rule of thumb, investors look for low ﬁnancial risk
in companies which have high operating risk and, conversely, will tolerate a higher
level of ﬁnancial risk where there is relatively low operating risk.
The terms operating gearing and ﬁnancial gearing are frequently used to describe
the extent of operating risk and ﬁnancial risk. (Financial gearing has been explained in
the previous section.) In terms of the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) they
are deﬁned as follows:
Operating gearing
Financial gearing
In analysis of published accounting information, it is not possible to estimate the
operating gearing because detailed information on ﬁxed costs is not provided. Thus
the term gearing is applied only in measuring ﬁnancial gearing. Despite the lack of
published information, professional investors will be aware of the importance of oper-
ating gearing and will try to understand as much as possible about the cost structure
of the company and of the industry. The next section illustrates the beneﬁts to share-
holders of having gearing present when operating proﬁts are rising and the risks when
operating proﬁts are falling.
13.4.3
Impact of gearing when profits are fluctuating
In a situation of ﬂuctuating proﬁts the presence of a ﬁxed charge, such as an interest
payment, will cause the proﬁt for ordinary shareholders to ﬂuctuate by a greater per-
centage. Table 13.1 sets out data to illustrate this ﬂuctuation. Company X has no gear-
ing but company Y has loan ﬁnance in its capital structure.
Table 13.2 uses the data to ask ‘what happens to earnings per share if there is an
increase or a decrease in operating proﬁt?’
The conclusion to be drawn from Table 13.2, panels (a) and (b), is that a 20% increase
or decrease in operating proﬁt causes a corresponding 20% increase or decrease in
proﬁt for ordinary shareholders in the ungeared company but a 40% increase or
decrease in proﬁt for ordinary shareholders in the geared company. It would appear
preferable to be a shareholder in a geared company when proﬁts are rising but to be 
a shareholder in an ungeared company when proﬁts are falling.
13.5 Pyramid of ratios
The various ratios which contribute to the analysis of management performance may
be thought of as forming a pyramid, as in Figure 13.1.

At the apex is the return on capital employed (measuring capital employed here as
total assets). As the pyramid spreads out there are more detailed explanations of how
the pyramid is built up. Net proﬁt as a percentage of total assets has two components.
One is the net proﬁt as a percentage of sales (revenue) and the other is sales (revenue)
as a multiple of total assets. Multiply these two together and you return to the net
proﬁt as a percentage of total assets. This relationship indicates that there could be

two quite different types of business, both of which may be highly successful. One
business trades on low margins, charging prices which look highly competitive, and
succeeds by having a high level of sales (revenue) so that the assets are being used
very effectively. The other business trades on high margins and sells goods or services
less frequently. You could contrast the discount furniture store on the outskirts of
town, where the car park is always full and the prices are unbeatable, with the 
old-world charm of the retail furnisher in the town centre whose prices look high but
which attracts customers preferring extra service and attention. Both businesses are
able to earn sufﬁcient return on total assets to satisfy the owners.
The pyramid then spreads out into two areas: proﬁtability and efﬁciency in the use
of assets. The relationships here are additive – each component explains a little of the
proﬁtability of sales (revenue) or the efﬁciency in the use of assets. The pyramid is a use-
ful tool of detective work to trace the cause of a change in return on capital employed.
13.6 Use and limitations of ratio analysis
The important feature of ratios is that they indicate trends and deviations from
expected patterns. Ratios taken in isolation for a single company or a single period of
time are of limited usefulness. The ﬁrst requirement is to ﬁnd a benchmark against
which to compare ratios calculated for one period only.
13.6.1
Evaluating ratios by comparison
The comparison could be made with any or all of:
l the company’s prior expectations of the outcome
l external observers’ prior expectations of the outcome
l ratios based on previous years’ ﬁgures for this company
l ratios calculated from this year’s ﬁgures for other companies
l ratios calculated from previous years’ ﬁgures for other companies
l industry averages published by commercial organisations.
The company’s prior expectations are set out in a budget which is usually kept
conﬁdential. It is therefore unlikely that the user of the ﬁnancial statements will have
access to such a high-quality source of comparison. External observers may also have
prior expectations. Professional analysts make forecasts of proﬁts to help them or their
clients in making investment decisions. The forecasts may be sent to clients of pro-
fessional advisers, by way of investment advice bulletins. There are directories which
publish such forecasts.
In the absence of information based on expectations, the user of the annual report
may have to rely on the past as a possible predictor of the future, or on comparisons
with other companies and industry norms. Professional investment advisers will col-
lect data from annual reports and calculate ratios in their preferred manner. Advisory
services will process the information and sell the results in the form of directories,
online search facilities or CD-ROM with regular updates. One of the most widely 
used sources of ratio analysis of company accounts is Datastream, available in many
colleges and universities and also used commercially. Organisations such as Reuters
publish regular analyses of company information but usually charge a commercial fee.
Newspapers and weekly journals such as the Financial Times and the Investors Chronicle
are yet another source of information which will include ratios.
It could be argued that companies should themselves publish the norms against
which their own particular results may be compared, but most would claim that their
business is unique and no comparisons would be entirely valid.

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
358
13.6.2
Limitations
No two companies are exactly alike in the nature of their operations. Comparisons
must make allowances for differences in the types of business or the relative weighting
of different types of business. Many companies operate in more than one industry so
that comparison with industry norms has to be treated with care.
Accounting numbers are used in ratio analysis and it has been a theme of the 
preceding chapters that accounting numbers may be affected by different accounting
policies. The most common causes of variation due to accounting policy differences lie
in depreciation and stock valuation, both of which are highly subjective.
Ratios are primarily a starting point from which to identify further questions to ask
about the present position and future directions of the operations and the ﬁnancing of
a company. They do not provide answers in themselves.
13.7 Worked example of ratio analysis
In the following worked example, information is provided about a company buying and
selling television and video equipment. Data are given for the current year in the ﬁrst
pair of columns and there are comparative ﬁgures for the previous year in the second pair
of columns. Ratios are calculated for the two years as an indication of trends. Tentative
comments are provided as to the possible interpretation of the resulting ﬁgures.

Share price information
When investors evaluate share price, they take the most up-to-date price available.
However, for the exercise of comparing ﬁnancial ratios it is useful to take the share
prices immediately after the preliminary announcement at the end of February or
beginning of March, representing the market’s opinion when the accounting infor-
mation has not become too much out of date.

Presenting the ratio calculations
Because there are so many variations on the methods of calculating ratios in account-
ing, it is extremely important to practise a useful and informative layout. That must
include, at a minimum:
l the name of each ratio
l the formula in words
l the workings to show how the formula has been applied
l the value of the ratio
l a narrative comment.
Tables 13.3 to 13.6 present this information in a set of ratio calculations for Peter
(Television) plc, each exhibit covering one of the main headings explained earlier. The
calculations are given ﬁrst for the more recent year, Year 2, followed by the compara-
tive ﬁgures for Year 1. A commentary is provided for each table.
Use the ratios explained in section 13.6 to carry out a full analysis of the Year 2 column of the
accounts of Peter (Television) plc. Prepare your analysis before you read Tables 13.3 to 13.6.
When you have finished, compare your analysis with the ratios calculated. Where your answers
differ, be sure that you understand whether it is due to an arithmetic error or a more
fundamental point. Keep a note of your score of the number of items calculated correctly.
Then go back to Year 1 and repeat the exercise. Hopefully your score of correct items
will have increased.

Comment. Earnings per share increased over the period, indicating an improved proﬁt performance for shareholders. The price earnings ratio rose, indi-
cating greater conﬁdence in the stock market about the sustainability of this new level of proﬁt. The dividend cover has fallen marginally, but is still more
than twice covered. This marginal decrease in dividend cover is caused by increasing the dividend per share from 5 pence to 6 pence. The dividend yield
has fallen, despite the increased dividend per share, because the market price has risen. The fall in yield may not be signiﬁcant if it reﬂects a general trend
in the market where, possibly, all shares have risen in price over the year. To say anything more about these ratios requires comparative ﬁgures for the
industry and for the market as a whole. Both types of data would be found in the Financial Times.

Comment. The return on shareholders’ equity and the return on capital employed both show an improvement on the previous year. This is due to an
improvement in the use of assets (total assets and ﬁxed assets) which more than offsets a fall in the operating proﬁt as a percentage of sales (revenue). The
gross proﬁt percentage fell by a similar amount, which suggests that the price charged for goods and services is not keeping pace with increases in costs.
The company should look carefully at either increasing prices or attempting to control costs of goods sold more effectively.

Comment. The current ratio has fallen over the period while the acid test ratio remains constant. The ratios appear relatively high and are probably still
within acceptable ranges (although this needs to be conﬁrmed by comparison with industry norms). One cause of the relatively high current ratio at the
start and end of the period appears to be in the combination of stock holding period and customers collection period compared to the suppliers payment
period. The period of credit taken by customers has increased and this should be investigated as a matter of urgency. There is a marginal decrease in the
stock holding period but it remains relatively long, compared to the creditors payment period. The acid test remains similar because there is an increase
in the number of customer days for payment and a similar increase in the number of supplier days for payment.

Comment. Gearing in the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) has remained almost constant and the interest cover has increased marginally. The
relative stability of the position indicates that there is probably no cause for concern but the ratios should be compared with those for similar companies

13.8 Linking ratios to the statement of cash flows
In Chapter 7 the statement of cash ﬂows of a company was illustrated and discussed.
Any ratio analysis which seeks to interpret liquidity, management performance or
ﬁnancial structure should be related to the information provided by the statement 
of cash ﬂows. Ratios give a measure of position at a particular point in time while 
the statement of cash ﬂows gives some understanding of the movements in cash and
cash-related items.
The operating cash ﬂow will be explained by a note showing the movements in
working capital and these may usefully be linked to changes in the rate of movement
of stock or the period of credit allowed to customers and taken from suppliers. The
ratio will give the change in terms of number of days, while the statement of cash
ﬂows will indicate the overall impact on liquid resources.
If the efﬁciency in the use of ﬁxed assets appears to have fallen, it may be that 
new assets were acquired during the year which, at the statement of ﬁnancial position
(balance sheet) date, were not fully effective in generating sales. That acquisition will
appear in the statement of cash ﬂows. If the gearing has changed, the impact on cash
ﬂow will be revealed in the statement of cash ﬂows.
Read again the sections of Chapters 3, 4 and 7 on statements of cash flows. What is the
purpose of the statement of cash flows? What are the main headings? Which ratios may
be used in conjunction with the statement of cash flows to help understand the financial
position of the company?
13.8.1
Explanation of a statement of cash flows
The statement of cash ﬂows in Table 13.7 is calculated from the statements of ﬁnancial
position (balance sheets) and income statement (proﬁt and loss account) of Peter
(Television) plc (see section 13.6). It is presented using headings similar to those of
Safe and Sure in Chapter 7. The headings are taken from the international accounting
standard IAS 7.
In Chapters 3, 5 and 6 you saw simple statements of cash ﬂows prepared using the
information entered in the cash column of a spreadsheet. Those were examples of
what is called the direct method of preparing a statement of cash ﬂows because the
ﬁgures came directly from the cash column of the transaction spreadsheet. The state-
ment of cash ﬂows in Table 13.7 is said to be prepared using the indirect method
because it takes an indirect route of starting with an accruals-based proﬁt ﬁgure and
then making adjustments to arrive at the cash ﬁgure. Consider each line in turn.
One purpose of the statement of cash ﬂows is to answer the question, ‘Why do we
have a cash problem despite making an operating proﬁt?’ We saw in Table 3.7 of
Chapter 3 that proﬁt and cash ﬂow can be different because the cash generated in 
making a proﬁt is spent in various ways. The statement of cash ﬂows emphasises ways
in which cash has come into, or moved out of, the company. So we start with proﬁt
before taxation of £129m.
Depreciation is an expense in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) which
represents cost being shared across accounting periods. There is no cash ﬂow and so
there should be no deduction for this item. To correct the position, depreciation of
£50m is ‘added back’ as an adjustment to the accounting proﬁt.
Next we consider how changes in working capital have affected cash ﬂow. Looking
ﬁrst at current assets, we ﬁnd that the inventories (stocks) have increased from £82m
to £115m. Allowing inventories (stocks) to increase has reduced the cash available 
for other purposes. Trade receivables (debtors) have increased from £61 to £89. This

Chapter 13 Ratio analysis
365
means the cash is ﬂowing less fast and so cash is reducing. Prepayments have
increased from £9m to £10m. This is also using up cash. In total the increases in 
current assets have used up £62m of the cash generated in making proﬁt.
Looking next at current liabilities, we see that trade payables (creditors) have
increased from £30m to £45m. If payables (creditors) are increasing, it means they are
not being paid. This helps cash ﬂow by not spending it. Accruals have increased by
£4m, again helping cash ﬂow by not making a payment. It is not a good idea to help
cash ﬂow indeﬁnitely by not paying creditors, but where stocks and debtors are
expanding to use up cash ﬂow, it is helpful if current liabilities are expanding in a 
similar way to hold back cash ﬂow.
Interest paid is taken from the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) as £24m.
There is no liability for unpaid interest at either the start or end of the period so the
amount in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) must equal the amount paid.
The taxation payment involves more calculation. Cash has been required to meet
the liability of £19m remaining in the Year 1 statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet), and also to pay half of the tax expense of Year 2, which is £21m. The calcu-
lation is: tax expense of the year as shown in the income statement (proﬁt and loss

(balance sheet), plus liability at the start of the year in the statement of ﬁnancial pos-
ition (balance sheet).
Capital expenditure is calculated by comparing the book values at the beginning
and end of the year and adjusting for changes during the year. We are told there were
no sales of ﬁxed assets so any increase must represent an addition. The balance started
at £1,118m, fell by £50m for depreciation, increased by the unknown ﬁgure for ad-
ditions, and ﬁnished at £1,155m. The missing ﬁgure is calculated as £87m.
The dividend paid during Year 2 was the dividend proposed at the end of Year 1.
If you look back to section 13.7.1, you will see the dividend paid as an entry in the 
‘reconciliation of movements on equity’.
Finally the right-hand column of the statement of cash ﬂows is added and produces
a ﬁgure of £40m which is then checked against the statement of ﬁnancial position 
(balance sheet) ﬁgures. This shows that cash has fallen from £46m to £6m and so the
calculation is conﬁrmed as being correct.
13.8.2
Analyst’s commentary
Here is the comment made by one analyst in a brieﬁng note to clients.
Despite making a proﬁt before taxation of £129,000, the cash balances of the company have
decreased by £40,000 during the year.
The cash generated by operating proﬁt is calculated by adding back depreciation of
£50,000 because this is an accounting expense which does not involve an outﬂow of cash.
The resulting cash ﬂow of £179,000 was eroded by allowing current assets to increase by
more than the increase in current liabilities. This suggests that we should ask questions
about the rate of usage of inventories (stocks) and the period of credit allowed to credit cus-
tomers (debtors). Our analysis [see section 13.7] shows that the inventories (stocks) holding
period reduced marginally from 86 to 83 days, which is not unexpected in the industry. The
period of credit taken from suppliers increased by 4 days but the customers collection period
increased by 8 days. Our attention should focus on the control of credit customers to look for
any weaknesses of credit control and a potential risk of bad debts.
After paying interest charges and taxation the company was still in cash surplus at
£72,000 but swung into cash deﬁcit through capital expenditure of £87,000. Taking in the
dividend payment of £25,000 the positive cash ﬂow of £72,000 changed to a negative cash
ﬂow of £40,000.
We take the view that in the short run it is reasonable to run down cash balances in this
way. The company probably had excessive liquidity at the end of Year 1. However, if there is
to be a further major investment in ﬁxed assets we would want to see long-term ﬁnance being
raised, either through a share issue or through a new long-term loan.
13.8.3
EBITDA
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. 
It is increasingly used by analysts as an approximate measure of cash ﬂow because it
removes the non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortisation from proﬁt. Instead
of a price–earnings multiple based on earnings per share, the analyst will relate share
price to EBITDA. The reason appears to be a desire to get away from the subjectivity
of accruals-based proﬁt and closer to cash ﬂow as something objectively measured.
13.8.4
Free cash flow
‘Free cash ﬂow’ is a phrase that you may encounter in company reports, particularly
in the narrative discussions by the chief executive and the ﬁnance director. It is a term
that is used differently by different people and so you have to read it in the setting

Chapter 13 Ratio analysis
367
where it is used. A common theme is to say, ‘We have calculated our operating cash
ﬂow and allowed for investment in working capital and we have deducted the
amount of cash invested in capital expenditure.’ How much cash does that leave free
to pay dividends or to invest in new ideas for expansion?
Following this theme, the calculation of free cash ﬂows generally starts with the net
cash ﬂow generated from operations (operating cash ﬂow after tax) and then deducts
the capital expenditure of the period. This leaves an amount of ‘free’ cash (in the sense
of ‘freely available’ for future planning). The free cash is available to pay dividends to
shareholders and to pay for further investment to expand the business. Directors have
to decide their priorities and allocate the cash accordingly. If the free cash ﬂow is a
negative ﬁgure then the company will need to borrow to pay dividends or ﬁnance
expansion.
13.9 Combining ratios for interpretation
Researchers have asked ‘Can we ﬁnd ways of combining ratios to predict types of
management behaviour in companies?’ There have been many answers published as
academic research papers. This section explains two answers that have developed
from academic research into commercial applications. The Z-score is used to predict
the risk of bankruptcy. The M-score is used to predict overstatement of earnings.
13.9.1
Z-score
An American academic, Edward Altman, published in 1968 the results of statistical
analysis of a large set of failed companies to establish a formula that could predict 
the likelihood of a company failing through becoming bankrupt.1 This statistical analy-
sis applied a combination of accounting ratios. Altman called the result a ‘z-score’. 
A UK-based academic, Richard Tafﬂer, developed a similar analysis for UK com-
panies, publishing the results in 1983. The Altman and Tafﬂer z-score calculations are
frequently applied in practice by analysts, such as credit analysts working in banks, to
assess the risk of an investment or a loan.
Tafﬂer’s model for analysing fully listed industrial ﬁrms is:
Z = 3.20 + 12.18*x1 + 2.50*x2 −10.68*x3 + 0.029*x4
x1 = proﬁt before tax/current liabilities (measures proﬁtability)
x2 = current assets/total liabilities (measures working capital position)
x3 = current liabilities/total assets (measures ﬁnancial risk)
x4 = no-credit interval (measures liquidity).
[No-credit interval = (quick assets −current liabilities)/daily operating expenses.
Daily operating expenses = (sales −pre-tax proﬁt −depreciation)/365]
Firms with a computed z-score less than 0 are at risk of failure (in the ‘at risk’ region);
those with z-score greater than 0 are ﬁnancially solvent.
13.9.2
M-score
Messod Beneish, an academic based in the USA, published in 1999 a statistical analysis
to be used in detecting overstatement of earnings.2 He used a combination of ﬁnancial
ratios which he called an ‘M-score’. He pointed out that such analysis should be used
with caution in screening companies, to consider whether any distortions in the ﬁnan-
cial statement numbers result from earnings manipulation or have another root. For
example the distortions could be the result of a material acquisition during the period

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
368
examined, a material shift in the company’s value maximising strategy, or a signiﬁcant
change in the company’s economic environment. The formula does not detect under-
statement of earnings.
The formula has been applied by Stockopedia, a stock-screening website. A dis-
cussion of this approach is provided in the Real World Case at the end of this section.
The M score is based on a combination of the following eight different indices:
1 DSRI = Days’ Sales in Receivables Index. This measures the ratio of days’ sales in
receivables versus prior year as an indicator of revenue inﬂation.
2 GMI = Gross Margin Index. This is measured as the ratio of gross margin versus
prior year. A ﬁrm with poorer prospects is more likely to manipulate earnings.
3 AQI = Asset Quality Index. Asset quality is measured as the ratio of non-current
assets other than plant, property and equipment to total assets, versus prior year.
4 SGI = Sales Growth Index. This measures the ratio of sales versus prior year. While
sales growth is not itself a measure of manipulation, the evidence suggests that
growth companies are likely to ﬁnd themselves under pressure to manipulate in
order to keep up appearances.
5 DEPI = Depreciation Index. This is measured as the ratio of the rate of depreciation
versus prior year. A slower rate of depreciation may mean that the ﬁrm is revising
useful asset life assumptions upwards, or adopting a new method that is income
friendly.
6 SGAI = Sales, General and Administrative expenses Index. This measures the
ratio of SGA expenses to the prior year. This is used on the assumption that analysts
would interpret a disproportionate increase in sales as a negative signal about
ﬁrms’ future prospects.
7 LVGI = Leverage Index. This measures the ratio of total debt to total assets 
versus prior year. It is intended to capture debt covenants incentives for earnings
manipulation.
8 TATA – Total Accruals to Total Assets. This assesses the extent to which managers
make discretionary accounting choices to alter earnings. Total accruals are calcu-
lated as the change in working capital accounts other than cash less depreciation.
The eight variables are then weighted together according to the following formula:
M = −4.84 + 0.92*DSRI + 0.528*GMI + 0.404*AQI + 0.892*SGI + 0.115*DEPI 
−0.172*SGAI + 4.679*TATA −0.327*LVGI
Beneish found that companies with a composite score greater than −1.78 had a higher
probability of manipulating their earnings favourably.
REAL WORLD CASE
‘M-Score’ flags dubious company earnings
Shareholders seeking an early warning of when to sell up, and traders aiming to profit from falling
prices, can now use an online indicator to spot companies with potentially unreliable earnings.
Stockopedia, the stock-screening website, has calculated the ‘M-Score’ for the 2,300 UK companies
in its database, which aims to identify those that may have, in some way, ‘manipulated’ their earnings
per share figures.
In early April, according to Stockopedia chief executive Edward Page-Croft, this M-Score correctly
predicted problems at SuperGroup – the clothing company that was later forced to issue a profit

Chapter 13 Ratio analysis
369
warning, claiming ‘arithmetic errors’ in its most recent profit forecast. SuperGroup shares fell 38 per
cent on the day.
Page-Croft says: ‘We’d been discussing SuperGroup’s appearance on our high-risk list just earlier 
in the week . . . the M-Score for SuperGroup was −1.19, well above the −1.78 threshold for high risk.
It was showing the following risk factors: receivables increasing strongly as a proportion of sales,
excessive sales growth and high accruals as a proportion of assets.’
More than a decade earlier, students at Cornell University had demonstrated the value of the 
M-Score, by using it to identify Enron as an ‘earnings manipulator’, before the company’s collapse 
in 2001 – something equity analysts failed to do.
M-Scores were first devised in the late 1990s by Professor Messod Beneish of Indiana University,
using a mathematical model of eight financial ratios that can help to detect signs of ‘earnings
manipulation’ – which is not illegal. These signs include extending customer credit terms and
reporting high sales growth.
Stockopedia believes M-Scores can now be used as a way of screening the market for shares to
‘short-sell’ – by borrowing stock, selling it and buying it back cheaper, or by simply trading derivatives
on the stock.
When Beneish tested this strategy over the period 1993–2003, it generated a hedged return of nearly
14 per cent per annum.
However, Page-Croft says an M-Score should only be used as a starting point. ‘You can’t be sure
without forensic accounting whether a company has genuinely been fiddling their numbers but, as 
an indicator to do further research, it’s pretty useful,’ he argues.
Professional investors suggest company accounts still need close scrutiny.
‘When a company is having problems it normally first appears on the company’s balance sheet before
reaching the profit and loss figures,’ says Richard Brown, investment specialist at Henderson Global
Investors. ‘For this reason, we spend a great deal of time looking at the debt level of a company. We
also look for more subtle indicators, such as inventory levels or accounts receivable. An increase in
either may suggest that a company is finding it difficult to reach its sales targets and are having to
offer clients better terms.’
Nicolas Ziegelasch, analyst at broker Killik & Co, says stockpickers also need to check for: the
capitalisation of expenses, to see if expenses from the current year are being shifted into the future;
the use of ‘accrual accounting or reserves’ to smooth out earnings; the revaluation of assets or
liabilities after an acquisition to release earnings; the classification of large expenses as ‘one-off
items’; and the recording of sales revenues in different financial years.
How and when revenue is recognised is ‘the key manipulation’, says James Butterfill, equity strategist
at Coutts. ‘Booking all in one year would make earnings very large for that year and consequently
distort valuations,’ he warns.
Ziegelasch recommends studying cash flow. ‘Look at the ratio of operating earnings to operating cash
flows,’ he says. ‘Often a company making profits but not generating any cash is a warning sign of
manipulation.’

13.10 Summary
The main areas of ratio analysis explained in this chapter are:
l investor ratios (summarised in Table 13.3)
l analysis of management performance (summarised in Table 13.4)
l liquidity and working capital (summarised in Table 13.5)
l gearing (summarised in Table 13.6).
Section 13.8 explains how the interpretation of ratios may be linked to an under-
standing of cash ﬂows. Section 13.9 explains how ratios may be combined to detect
ﬁnancial distress or overstatement of earnings.
It is essential to treat ratio analysis with great caution and to understand the basis
of calculation and the nature of the data used. For that reason the illustrations have
been set out in detail using a layout that allows you to demonstrate your knowledge
of the formula, your ability to collect data for calculation, and the result of that calcu-
lation which can then be interpreted. In this chapter all the information has been made
available to you as and when you required it. In Chapter 14 we move on to consider
published ﬁnancial statements where more exploration may be required to ﬁnd the
most useful information.
The general principles explained in this chapter can be applied to the annual report
of any proﬁt-seeking business. The precise formulae may require adaptation to suit
particular national characteristics. However, international comparison requires great
caution. Accounting policies and practices are not yet harmonised entirely. If the
underlying data are not comparable then neither are the ratios.
The key is to ask ﬁrst, ‘What value do we expect for this ratio?’ Then calculate the
ratio and seek an interpretation of the similarity or difference.

The Questions section of each chapter has three types of question. ‘Test your understanding’
questions to help you review your reading are in the ‘A’ series of questions. You will find the
answers to these by reading and thinking about the material in the book. ‘Application’ questions

14.1 Introduction
You have learned from Chapter 13 the basic techniques of ratio analysis that may help
you to interpret the performance of a company relative to other companies or other
periods of time. You have also learned how the ratios may be linked to the statement
of cash ﬂows to interpret the factors affecting cash ﬂow. It might be helpful to users 
of annual reports if companies themselves would carry out some analysis and inter-
pretation of this type. There was a time when it was felt that the role of the company
should stop at the presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. Today, however, there is an
expectation that companies will recognise the need to give more information to users,
such as an objective discussion. The title of the discussion that is included in the
annual report may be the business review or it may be the operating and ﬁnancial
review (OFR). Companies may choose to provide other guidance such as highlights
statements and trends of data. Most large companies report group accounts which, as
explained in Chapter 7, are quite complex. Because of this complexity, analysts like 
to receive segmental information that breaks the total information into key areas of
activity of the business. Some companies have sought to avoid disclosing all their
activities in group accounts by use of ‘off-balance-sheet ﬁnance’. Because this omission
may distort the view of performance, the standard-setters have tried to restrict the use
of off-balance-sheet ﬁnance and encourage full reporting of group activities.
Beyond the responsibility for ﬁnancial performance, the managers of companies have
a responsibility and accountability to society in terms of their social and environmental
activities. They are expected to demonstrate accountability by reporting on social and
environmental activity in the annual report. The managers are also expected to follow
best practice in the way they operate their business and in their relations with share-
holders. This is described as corporate governance and the compliance with good
practice in corporate governance must also be explained in the annual report.
Finally this chapter gives a taste of three areas of debate that extend beyond a ﬁrst-
level course in accounting but which help the student to be aware that studying
accounting should include a questioning and thoughtful approach to what is being
learned. These three areas of debate are: the meaning of ‘true and fair’; the nature of
value; and the relevance of the stakeholder model.
14.2 Operating and financial review (OFR) and business review
14.2.1
Development of the OFR and the business review
The operating and ﬁnancial review (OFR) has been a feature of the annual reports of
many UK listed companies since 1993.1 It was created by the UK ASB as a move
Learning
outcomes
After reading this chapter you should be able to:
l Explain the importance of the operating and financial review as a component of
the annual report of a company.
l Describe and explain other useful information in the annual report that is relevant
to analysis of corporate performance.
l Relate the interpretation of ratios to the information in a statement of cash flows.
l Explain how segmental information is useful to the analysis of corporate
performance.

Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance

towards providing shareholders with information on a company’s performance and
prospects. The ASB received encouragement from the Cadbury Committee in its 1992
report on the ﬁnancial aspects of corporate governance. From 1993 to 2005 the pro-
vision of an OFR in an annual report was voluntary. The ASB hoped that giving com-
panies wide discretion would encourage the development of best practice in reporting
rather than a slavish adherence to rules which might result in a lacklustre document.
Most larger listed companies published an OFR in the annual report.
In 2004 the European Commission issued its Modernisation Directive requiring all
member states to incorporate a business review in the legislation governing annual
reports. Initially the UK government intended to meet this requirement by making the
OFR a legal requirement, because it felt that the OFR could cover all the requirements
of the business review and achieve other useful purposes in communicating with
shareholders. Very brieﬂy, in 2005, the OFR became mandatory but by the start of 2006
the legislation had been repealed because the government decided that a mandatory
OFR would be adding unnecessarily to the regulatory burden facing UK companies
(referred to as ‘gold plating’ the regulation).
From comments made at that time it appeared that the OFR was a somewhat strange
target for reducing regulation because users of annual reports found it useful and it was
a location for reporting on the activities carried out by companies that harmonised
with government policy on social issues. There is also a continuing strong movement
towards more narrative discussion in annual reports, as explained later in this chapter.
UK companies are now faced with Company Law requiring a Business Review 2 and
the UK ASB providing non-mandatory guidance on the OFR in Reporting Statement 1
(RS 1): Operating and Financial Review.3 The ASB has indicated that following the 
recommendations of the OFR will cover the requirements of the business review.
However, it seems that most companies prefer to use the ‘business review’ description.
14.2.2
Business review
The Companies Act 2006 explains that the purpose of the business review is to inform
members of the company and help them assess how the directors have performed
their duty to promote the success of the company. The business review must contain
(a) a fair review of the company’s business, and (b) a description of the principal risks
and uncertainties facing the company.
The fair review is to be a balanced and comprehensive analysis of (a) the devel-
opment and performance of the company’s business during the ﬁnancial year, and 
(b) the position of the company’s business at the end of that year.
If the company is quoted on a stock exchange it must comply with further require-
ments that include:
(a) the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development, performance
and position of the company’s business; and
(b) information about:
(i)
environmental matters, including the impact of the company’s business on
the environment,
(ii)
the company’s employees, and
(iii) social and community issues
(c) information about persons with whom the company has contractual or other
arrangements which are essential to the business of the company.
The review must also, to the extent necessary for an understanding of the develop-
ment, performance or position of the company’s business, include:
(a) analysis using ﬁnancial key performance indicators, and
(b) where appropriate, analysis using other key performance indicators, including
information relating to environmental matters and employee matters.

14.2.3
Key performance indicators (KPIs)4
There is no speciﬁc guidance in the Companies Act on how to deﬁne key perform-
ance indicators (KPIs) but there is some guidance provided by the UK ASB in its
Reporting Statement RS 1 on the Operating and Financial Review. KPIs are quantiﬁed
measures of factors that help to measure the performance of the business effectively.
They reﬂect ‘critical success factors’ and show how the entity is progressing towards
its objectives.
The Reporting Statement RS 1 encourages the entity to provide in its OFR sufﬁcient
information to enable members to understand each KPI disclosed in the OFR. These
KPIs are expected to become an important help to shareholders in understanding the
performance of the entity as seen by the directors. For each KPI the directors should
give a deﬁnition and explain the calculation. They should explain the purpose of the
KPIs and the sources of data used, together with any assumptions made. There should
be a commentary on each KPI and future targets, with comparative ﬁgures for the 
previous year. Where there is a change in a KPI there should be an explanation and a
calculation giving comparison to previous years.
Examples of KPIs are:
l Return on capital employed (see Chapter 13).
l Market share – the revenue of the entity as a percentage of the industry total (e.g. a
market leader demonstrating dominant position).
l Average revenue per customer (e.g. in a pay-per-view television service).
l Sales per square foot of selling space (e.g. a chain of retail stores).
l Employee costs per £ of sales (any labour-intensive business).
l Environmental spillage (e.g. in a business using toxic chemicals).
The following extract from the annual report of Safe and Sure plc shows how Key
Performance Indicators are reported.

14.2.4
Directors’ and auditors’ responsibilities for 
the business review
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the business
review. The auditors read the business review, along with other narrative sections 
of the annual report, to satisfy themselves that there are no inconsistencies between
the information in the narrative report and that in the ﬁnancial statements. If they ﬁnd

Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance
379
an inconsistency they will discuss it with the directors and attempt to resolve the 
problem. When the business review was being introduced the government wanted a
stronger form of audit that would review the process by which the business review
was prepared, but this stronger form of audit was resisted by both auditors and 
directors. Commentators felt that too strong a burden would be placed on auditors
and directors if subsequent events did not correspond to expectations raised by the
business review.
14.2.5
Objective and principles of the OFR
Although the business review is the requirement of the Companies Act 2006, the UK
ASB has retained its Reporting Statement for the OFR, asserting that a company which
applies the OFR will also meet the requirements of the business review.
The stated objective of the OFR is to provide a balanced and comprehensive analysis,
consistent with the size and complexity of the business, of:5
(a) the development and performance of the business of the entity during the ﬁnancial
year;
(b) the position of the entity at the end of the ﬁnancial year;
(c) the main trends and factors underlying the development, performance and position
of the business of the entity during the ﬁnancial year; and
(d) the main trends and factors which are likely to affect the entity’s future develop-
ment, performance and position, prepared so as to assist members to assess the
strategies adopted by the entity and the potential for those strategies to succeed.
The objective mentions only ‘members’ of the company, which means the existing
shareholders. Earlier drafts of the reporting standard attempted to widen the objective
to include intending investors but this was criticised as being too wide-ranging. There
is no mention of any other stakeholders. (Look back to Chapter 1 for the potential
range of interested parties.)
The ASB sets out seven principles6 followed by a disclosure framework.
1 The OFR should set out an analysis of the business through the eyes of the board of
directors.
2 The OFR should focus on matters that are relevant to the interests of members.
3 The OFR should have a forward-looking orientation, identifying those trends and 
factors relevant to the members’ assessment of the current and future performance
of the business and the progress towards the achievement of long-term business
objectives.
4 The OFR should complement as well as supplement the ﬁnancial statements, in
order to enhance the overall corporate disclosure.
5 The OFR should be comprehensive and understandable.
6 The OFR should be balanced and neutral, dealing even-handedly with both good
and bad aspects.
7 The OFR should be comparable over time.
What are the signiﬁcant aspects of these principles? The idea of looking through the
eyes of the directors is an important feature. It carries the idea of taking shareholders
inside the company to reduce the gap between directors, who manage the company,
and shareholders, who own the company. The forward-looking orientation is another
important feature because shareholders want to make estimates of the future of their
investment. ‘Forward-looking’ does not mean that the company will be making a 
forecast. The idea of balancing good and bad aspects is important but in practice it
may be difﬁcult to persuade directors to say as much about bad aspects as they do
about the good ones. One argument the directors put forward is that if they disclose

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
380
bad aspects of performance there will be loss of conﬁdence and the bad will become
worse.
14.2.6
OFR disclosure framework
The Reporting Statement does not set out a format or a template. It does not specify
headings that must be included in an OFR. However, the section of the Reporting
Statement describing the disclosure framework runs from paragraphs 27 to 76 with
headings and bold-lettered paragraphs and liberal sprinkling of the verb ‘shall’ (mean-
ing ‘must’), so it seems likely that companies will tend to use similar headings.
The framework is introduced by a statement that the OFR shall provide information
to assist members to assess the strategies adopted by the entity and the potential for
those strategies to succeed. Four key elements of the framework are then speciﬁed:7
(a) The nature of the business, including a description of the market, competitive and
regulatory environment in which the entity operates and the entity’s objectives
and strategies.
(b) The development and performance of the business, both in the ﬁnancial year
under review and in the future.
(c) The resources, principal risks and uncertainties and relationships that may affect
the entity’s long-term value.
(d) The position of the business including a description of the capital structure, 
treasury policies and objectives and liquidity of the entity, both in the ﬁnancial
year under review and in the future.
14.2.7
International developments
The IASB has published guidance on a Management Commentary that may be
included in annual reports. The guidance is called a Practice Statement and is not a
mandatory standard. It provides the following deﬁnition:
A management commentary is a narrative report that relates to financial statements that
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs. Management commentary provides users
with historical explanations of the amounts presented in the financial statements, specifically
the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. It also provides com-
mentary on an entity’s prospects and other information not presented in the financial state-
ments. Management commentary also serves as a basis for understanding management’s
objectives and its strategies for achieving those objectives.
The guidance explains that a management commentary should provide users of 
ﬁnancial statements (existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors)
with integrated information providing a context for the related ﬁnancial statements,
including the entity’s resources and the claims against the entity and its resources, and
the transactions and other events that change them.
Management commentary should be consistent with the following principles:
l provide management’s view of the entity’s performance, position and progress
(including forward looking information);
l supplement and complement information presented in the ﬁnancial statements
(and possess the qualitative characteristics described in the Conceptual Framework for
Financial Reporting).
In presentation, a management commentary should be clear and straightforward and
be presented with a focus on the most important information in a manner intended to
address the principles described in the Practice Statement, speciﬁcally:

Activity 14.1
Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance
381
l being consistent with its related ﬁnancial statements;
l avoiding duplicating disclosures made in the notes to the ﬁnancial statements
where practicable;
l avoiding generic and immaterial disclosures.
Companies based in Europe do not at present follow this guidance on a non-mandatory
Management Commentary because national laws, under a directive of the European
Commission, all require a management report or business review that covers similar
ground.
In the US there is a requirement for a report called the Management’s Discussion
and Analysis (MD&A). This is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) from all companies listed on one of the US stock exchanges (mainly the New
York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ over-the-counter market). The SEC has detailed
regulations setting out the content of the MD&A. If you are studying or researching a
US-listed company you may ﬁnd the company’s MD&A in its annual report or you
may ﬁnd it in the company’s report to the SEC (called a ‘form 10-K’). The company’s
web page for ‘investors’ is often the best place to search. Some UK companies have
their shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. These companies
also prepare an MD&A for the SEC but it is within a report called a ‘form 20-F’. You
will probably ﬁnd this on the web page for ‘investors’ if you are studying or research-
ing a UK company that has a listing in both London and New York.
Read through the sections on the business review and the OFR again. How much of the
information suggested for the business review or the OFR is extracted directly from the
financial statements? How much of the information suggested for the business review 
or the OFR provides additional understanding which is not available from the financial
statements?
14.3 Other guidance in analysis
In Figure 7.1, there is a list of ‘accompanying information’ that may be found in the
annual report. The ﬁrst item listed there is the operating and ﬁnancial review,
explained in section 14.2. The second item is the Chairman’s statement, which usually
appears at the start of the annual report, as a short narrative lasting no more than a
page and often preceded by a ‘Highlights’ statement of key ﬁnancial measures. The
Chairman sets out key features as an introduction to the detail that follows in later
pages. The third item listed there is the Directors’ report, which is usually found part-
way through the annual report. Its contents are required partly by the Companies Act,
partly by the Stock Exchange Listing Rules and partly by the Corporate Governance
Code. The fourth item is the historical summaries that allow trends to be seen over
several years, with some companies giving ﬁve-year trends and others giving ten-year
trends. The ﬁnal item is ‘non-accounting and non-ﬁnancial information’. This covers
the rest of the annual report and often provides the most interesting aspects for the
reader who wants to understand the company in its entirety.
In this section we will consider the highlights statement and the historical trend
analysis.

The Highlights statement shows what the company regards as important infor-
mation for investors as the primary users of the annual report. Turnover is a measure
of the size of operations, with growth of turnover being an indicator of expansion.
Proﬁt is the reward for shareholders, with growth again being an important indicator.
Segment ﬁgures are provided for both turnover and proﬁt. This company has a target
proﬁt growth of 20% per annum and so is emphasising that it has more than met the
target. Earnings per share and dividend per share are the key indicators from which
investors can calculate yields based on the current market price. There is no regulation
of highlights statements and so other companies may give different information.
Together with the Chairman’s statement, the Highlights present the key messages of
the annual report.
14.3.2
Historical summaries and trend analysis
Listed companies usually provide a historical summary of the ﬁnancial statements 
of previous years. The historical summary for Safe and Sure may be found in
Appendix I. The analyst may use this table to establish trends of:
l year-on-year growth of turnover and operating proﬁt
l growth rates adjusted for annual inﬂation
l key ratios.
The company does not usually carry out the ratio analysis; this is left to the analysts
to calculate and interpret. On relatively rare occasions the company will provide ratios
but it is not always clear which formula has been used.
14.3.3
Finance director’s review
There are relatively few references to ratios in the annual reports of companies. Some
ﬁnance directors claim that interpretation of ratios is a very complex matter. They say
that if they provide ratio calculations in the annual report, then they will have to pro-
vide detailed explanation, which will make the report too lengthy. So in general they
leave the ratios for others to calculate and interpret. Sometimes they will comment on
a ratio where they know the expert users will ask questions.
In the operating and ﬁnancial review of Safe and Sure plc the ﬁnance director 
states:

Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance
383
The pleasing return on our tangible net assets (42.4% per annum before tax on average 
net assets) reﬂects the high value of the intangible assets of the Safe and Sure brand and of
businesses built up over the years. Such value is not reported in the statement of ﬁnancial
position (balance sheet).
Is it possible to check on the ﬁnance director’s calculation? He has used pre-tax
proﬁt which is £177m (£197.5m from continuing and £20.5m from discontinued 
operations) and the average of the tangible net assets. The respective ﬁgures for 
Year 7 and Year 6 are £464.3m and £370.4m. The average net assets ﬁgure is therefore
£417.4m. The calculation of the ratio is:
× 100% = 42.4%
which conﬁrms the ﬁgure given by the ﬁnance director. (It should be noted that
conﬁrming ratios reported in annual reports is not always so straightforward, although
it ought to be.) We need other evidence before we can agree that 42.4% is a ‘pleasing’
return.
In the next section, David aims to explain his approach to using ratios to pinpoint
target areas for probing by way of questions to the company, while Leona explains
how ratios are useful to the auditor.
14.3.4
The analyst and the auditor
DAVID: We subscribe to the major online database sources of information about companies,
so I don’t very often sit down to calculate ratios. I’m more interested in the interpretation.
There are a few key ratios that I look at for major clues as to strange goings-on and then 
I scan a more detailed ratio report for unusual changes. We can program in an instruction
to set a warning flag against any ratio which has altered by more than a specified range
since the previous figures, or over a given period of time.
What do I look to first? Gross margins on turnover and net margins on turnover, with as
much segmental detail as I can find. Segmental information is an area where often we do
have to carry out our own analysis using our skills, experience and specialist sources of
information. Not many databases break down the company’s results by segment. Then I’ll
check the tax charge as a percentage of the taxable profit. It should be around 30% if the
company’s accounts have been accepted for tax purposes, but if there are items which the
tax authorities don’t allow, then the percentage will be different. I’m always interested in
what appears in the income statement (profit and loss account) but is not accepted by the
tax rules. Depreciation is a notoriously variable figure and is difficult to spot because the
accounting rules say that a change in depreciation rate or useful asset life is not a change
in policy. Companies have to draw attention to a change in policy and explain the impact.
Depreciation escapes that rule. So I calculate the depreciation charge as a percentage of
total asset value. If that percentage changes then I start asking questions.
Common-size statements are very useful. That means turning all items in the financial
statements to percentages with the total assets represented by 100% in the statement of
financial position (balance sheet) and the turnover represented by 100% in the income
statement (profit and loss account). It is also useful to have percentage changes from one
year to the next. That is all relatively easy when you are using spreadsheets.
Over a period of time I monitor the variability of a ratio for a particular company. I calculate
this as:
Again I am looking for unusual movements outside an expected range.

Mean value of ratio

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
384
LEONA: The auditors don’t rely on anyone else’s calculations. We carry out our own ratio
analysis as part of our analytical review. For commercial, manufacturing and service 
companies we monitor a standard list of ratios which is:
l
acid test ratio
l
current ratio
l
customers collection period
l
inventories (stocks) holding period
l
gearing
l
interest cover
l
return on capital employed
l
return on total assets
l
gross profit margin.
We are looking at these with a focus on the particular concerns of the auditor. Possible 
liquidity crises or working capital shortages could raise a question as to whether the 
company is a going concern. Customer collection period provides a clue to whether the
doubtful debt provision is adequate. Inventories holding period may indicate a need for
provision for slow-moving inventories. Gearing and interest cover are further indicators of
financial stability or otherwise in relation to the going concern issue. Return on capital
employed and on total assets may show inefficient use of assets and perhaps point to
assets which have no future benefit. Gross margins may cause us to ask questions about
incorrect records of sales or stocks if the margins are different from the norms.
For listed companies we also look at the dividend cover and the Altman Z-score. The 
Z-score is a model developed for use in predicting insolvency. You need to read a finance
textbook to get the details, but basically it is a combined score based on a list of key 
variables all pointing to potential insolvency problems. We have to be able to say that the
business is a going concern, so that kind of information is important to us.
DAVID: That’s OK for the current year. What about trends?
LEONA: Yes, trends are an important part of our review. We try to use a predictive approach
and estimate the current year’s figure from the previous data rather than merely compare
this year with last. Taking a predictive approach encourages us to challenge fluctuations
and to seek persuasive explanations. We use all the familiar forms of trend analysis – 
graphical representation, moving averages and simple regression analysis.
DAVID: How much reliance do you place on these analytical procedures?
LEONA: It can range from conclusive reliance to no reliance at all. It depends very much 
on the nature of the assertions being tested, the plausibility and predictability of the 
relationships involved, and the extent to which data is available and reliable.
DAVID: Maybe I have underestimated auditors in the past. None of the activities you
describe is really apparent from the audit report. Perhaps you undersell your work.
LEONA: I probably have to admit that our work stops when we have gained sufficient 
assurance to write the audit report. We don’t give information to the reader – that is not 
the function of the audit.
DAVID: You and I need to spend more time together on this question of analysis in depth.
Analysts with insight command top ratings and that’s what I’m looking for. And I think the
benefit would not all be one-way – I can help you with broader awareness of the strategies
used by management in giving the markets the messages they want to convey.
LEONA: Sounds fine to me.

Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance
385
14.4 Segmental information
In Sections 7.7 and 7.8, you read about the group structure used by many companies, and
saw the method of construction of consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Safe and Sure
presents consolidated ﬁnancial statements, which are discussed in section 7.4. The
process of consolidation of ﬁnancial information in group accounts is intended to be
an improvement on sending the parent company shareholders a bundle of the separate
ﬁnancial statements of each member of the group. It lets them see, in one set of ﬁnancial
statements, the full picture of the group. On the negative side, the process of aggregation
causes a loss of information about the various different activities of the group. In order
to balance the beneﬁts of aggregation with the need for detail, accounting provides
additional information about the various segments of the group on a year-by-year basis.
14.4.1
Users’ needs for information
Consolidated ﬁnancial statements are a very convenient means of bringing together 
a large volume of data, but they suffer a major defect in losing much of the rich 
detail available from seeing each constituent company separately. It is particularly
important for users of ﬁnancial statements to know how the results of various activities
compare, where the group of companies is involved in more than one product line 
and more than one type of market.
Segmental reporting has developed as a means of supplementing the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements by providing more insight into the activities of the group. In 
particular it reports information about the different types of products and services 
that an entity produces and the different geographical areas in which it operates.
The accounting standard which deals with segmental reporting8 requires the entity
to disclose information to enable users of its ﬁnancial statements to evaluate the nature
and ﬁnancial effects of the business activities in which it engages and the economic
environments in which it operates. To achieve this objective the managers start by
identifying the operating segments from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses.
These operating segments will be regularly reviewed by the entity’s ‘chief operating
decision maker’. The information provided about each segment will correspond to that
provided to the chief operating decision maker. In this way the standard seeks to help
the user of ﬁnancial statements view the business in the way it is seen by its managers.
The entity must disclose some general information about how the reportable seg-
ments have been identiﬁed and the types of products and services from which each
reportable segment derives its revenues. It must also report a measure of proﬁt or 
loss and total assets for each reportable segment and a measure of liabilities for each
segment if that information is regularly provided to the chief operating ofﬁcer.
The entity must also disclose speciﬁc accounting information as set out in the 
following list, if these items are reported to the chief operating decision maker:
(a) revenues from external customers
(b) revenues from transactions with other operating segments of the same entity
(c) interest revenue
(d) interest expense
(e) depreciation and amortisation
(f) material items of income and expense
(g) the entity’s interest in the proﬁt or loss of associates and joint ventures
(h) income tax expense or income
(i)
material non-cash items other than depreciation and amortisation.
The accounting standard containing these requirements took effect from 1 January
2009, with a review promised in 2012. Those commentators who were concerned
about this standard felt that it gave too much discretion to the company management

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
386
and could even be damaging to the quality of corporate governance. The IASB sup-
ported the standard by referring to research showing that when a similar standard
was introduced in the US no detrimental effects were observed.
Research9 has shown that under IFRS 8 the number of segments has increased and
the extent of the segmental note disclosure has increased. Interviews with users of
reports have welcomed the management-based approach but have expressed some
concern that the ﬂexibility of the standard could allow managerial manipulation of
disclosures. There is not always consistency between the narrative sections of the
annual report and the IFRS 8 segmental note disclosure.
14.4.2
Information provided in the financial statements
The group statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) and income statement (proﬁt
and loss account) of Safe and Sure plc are presented in full in Chapter 7 and have 
been explored in more detail in subsequent chapters. Consequently you are already
familiar with much of the information about the assets and liabilities of the group.
Parent company
Some companies publish the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) of the 
parent company alongside or near to the group statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet). This is a requirement for groups that continue to report under UK rules, but is
not compulsory for group accounts prepared under the IASB system. In most cases 
the parent company statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) conﬁrms that the
parent is primarily a holding company whose main asset is the investment in its 
subsidiaries. It owns some of the group’s land and buildings and a small portion of the
vehicle ﬂeet. Its current assets consist mainly of amounts owed by subsidiaries and
dividends due from subsidiaries. Its current liabilities consist mainly of amounts owed
to subsidiaries and dividends payable to its own shareholders. The parent company
has some long-term liabilities for money borrowed to purchase subsidiaries. Most of
the cash used for purchase of new subsidiaries is provided by the new wealth generated
by the group as a whole.
Group
Information about the Safe and Sure group is very much more interesting than infor-
mation about the parent company alone. That is why the preceding chapters have used
the group information about Safe and Sure to explain the treatment of assets, liabilities
and ownership interest. There are a few particular items of interest in respect of acqui-
sitions of new subsidiaries and the use of the goodwill reserve. There is also some
interesting information about the various segments of the business which contribute to
the overall picture. This section summarises those particular features of the annual report.
14.4.3
Identifying segments
The IASB system requires the operating segments reported by an entity to be the organ-
isational units for which information is reported regularly to the chief operating decision
maker. The chief operating decision maker is likely to be the chief executive, working
with the board of directors to use the information for evaluating past performance and
making decisions about future allocation of resources. So the intention is that the segment
reporting reﬂects the information that management is using in running the business.
14.4.4
Segmental information in Safe and Sure
As an illustration of the type of segmental information available, the note to the
income statement (proﬁt and loss account) of Safe and Sure plc is set out in Note 16 to
the ﬁnancial statements. It is one of the lengthiest notes provided by the company.

Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance
387
Note 16 Operating segments
For the purposes of reporting to the chief operating decision maker, the group is
currently organised into two operating divisions, (1) disposal and recycling, (2) security
and cleaning. Disposal and recycling includes all aspects of collection and safe disposal
of industrial and commercial waste products. Security and cleaning is undertaken by
renewable annual contract, predominantly for hospitals, other healthcare premises and
local government organisations.
The group’s disposal and recycling operation in North America was discontinued with
effect from 30 April Year 7.

The group’s two business segments operate in four main geographical areas, even
though they are managed on a worldwide basis. In the following analysis, revenue is
based on the country in which the order is received. It would not be materially different 
if based on the country in which the customer is located. Total assets and capital

The information contained in Note 16 relates to a service business, so it might be
expected that the non-current assets would be relatively low compared to the turnover
and operating proﬁt. Professional analysts would be particularly interested in the 
relationships and trends underlying these ﬁgures.
David and Leona have returned from their holiday and are again working on Leona’s
ﬂat. In the middle of a less than successful attempt to ﬁt a carpet, David pauses for coffee
and explains how he looked at the segmental information presented by the company.
DAVID: The first thing I did here was to feed all these tables of segmental information into
our spreadsheet package. I asked for two printouts initially. The first calculated the sales
(revenue) as a multiple of net assets and the operating profit as a percentage of sales, using
continuing activities in each case because the assets remaining at the end of the period do
not include the assets of the discontinued activity. [The results are shown in Table 14.1,
panel (a).] The second printout shows the sales to non-current assets for each geographical
area. [The results are shown in Table 14.1, panel (b).] From this the relative strengths and
weaknesses within the organisation begin to emerge. The percentage changes (Table 14.2)
also show some interesting differences. I need to ask why the total assets for security and
cleaning have reduced so much when there was no disposal in this segment. Perhaps the
assets were transferred into disposal and recycling to replace those that were discontinued.

Then I turned to the front of the annual report. The importance of segmental information
becomes apparent as soon as you start to read the chairman’s statement and it continues
through the business reviews, presented on a segmental basis with some helpful illus-
trations to reinforce the message. The chief executive’s review continues the segmental
theme strongly and gives further information to augment the basic tables which I have
already analysed. That attention to detail in their reports is a reflection of the thorough
questioning which these people receive from the fund managers and analysts who follow
the company closely. I know one analyst who would put Sherlock Holmes in the shade. 
She collects the accounts of each individual UK company in the group, and as many 
overseas subsidiary companies as she can get hold of. She puts them all together like a
jigsaw and then starts to ask intensive questions based on what she has and what she 
can deduce about the missing pieces. Seasoned finance directors wilt visibly under her
interrogation!
LEONA: Segmental reporting is an area where you and your analyst friends probably put
more pressures on the companies than we can as auditors. That’s a good example of mar-
ket forces at work, but it does assume that the information you prise out of the company
is made available more widely. Companies make use of the business review or the operat-
ing and financial review to answer the questions which they know the investors ask on a
regular basis.
14.5 Off-balance-sheet finance
One major problem for UK accounting emerged in the 1980s in a period of business
expansion. To ﬁnance expansion, companies were borrowing and therefore increasing
their gearing ratios. Some companies looked for ways of avoiding disclosing in the
statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) the full extent of the commitment on
borrowed funds. Omitting the item from the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance
sheet) could not remove the commercial obligation but it could reduce the questions
arising from those who would read the ﬁnancial statements.
The accounting question is: How do you remove, or fail to include, a liability so 
that no one will notice? The answer, as with all accounting questions, starts in the
accounting equation. To keep the equation in balance, any removal of a liability must
be matched by removal of an asset of equal amount.
Many ingenious schemes emerged, but one of the least complex is the sale and
leaseback of land and buildings.
14.5.1
Sale and leaseback of property
Consider the following scenario. A company has the following statement of ﬁnancial
position (balance sheet):

The company sells the land and buildings for £20m and repays the loan. The statement
of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet) now appears to contain no gearing:
£m
Other assets, less current liabilities
15
Share capital
15
However, enquiry behind the scenes reveals a complex arrangement. The land and
buildings were sold to a consortium of ﬁnance companies, but on the same day a lease
was signed that allowed the company to continue occupying the property at a rental
payment which would vary according to current rates of interest and would be calcu-
lated as a percentage of the £20m cash received. In ﬁve years’ time the company would
have the option to repurchase the land and buildings at £20m and the consortium of
ﬁnance companies would have the option to force the company to repurchase at £20m.
These options would mean that if the price rose over the next ﬁve years the company
would wish to buy at £20m. If the price fell over the next ﬁve years the consortium
would insist on repurchase.
Now ask yourself, where do the beneﬁts and risks of this contract lie? The beneﬁts
of a rise in value and the risks of a decrease in value remain with the company, as they
would if the company had remained the owner. The company will pay a rental which
looks very much like an interest payment on a loan of £20m. If the company fails to
meet its obligations, then the consortium will claim the asset. The commercial effect of
this transaction is that of a loan based on the security of the asset of land and buildings.
14.5.2
UK response
In the absence of a standard to back up the argument, auditors felt unable to argue
against the directors of companies who moved assets and liabilities off the statement
of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet). After some years of consultation and discussion
with interested parties, the UK ASB decided that such transactions did not change the
commercial substance of the transaction and it is the commercial substance which 
matters. A standard was introduced to require a transaction of this type to be reported
on the statement of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet)10 in the form of an asset and
matching liability. Not all countries shared this view because it involved making 
a judgement on the balance of risks and rewards. Making judgements leaves the 
company and the auditors open to challenge and so it could be argued that speciﬁc
rules are preferable to general principles. In particular the US had a more rules-
based approach to deﬁning recognition on and off the statement of ﬁnancial position 
(balance sheet).
14.5.3
Special purpose entities
The problems associated with off-balance-sheet ﬁnance received a high public proﬁle
at the end of 2001, running into 2002, with the failure of a large US company called
Enron. Because of the size of the company and the political impact of its failure, hear-
ings were called by the US Congress at which witnesses gave evidence on accounting
practices, among other matters. One of the accounting issues discussed was the 

Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance
391
Activity 14.2
question of ‘off-balance-sheet ﬁnance’. The Chief Accountant of the Securities and
Exchange Commission described to the House of Representatives how money could
be borrowed at advantageous rates of interest using a ‘special purpose entity’ which
was not consolidated with the rest of the group accounts. Provided the assets of the
special purpose entity retained sufﬁcient value, the lender would be content with the
arrangement. If the assets fell in value then the lender would look to the parent com-
pany for reimbursement. Shareholders in the parent would be unaware of the extent
of such borrowing until the lenders demanded repayment. At the time of the failure
of Enron the US standard-setting body (the Financial Accounting Standards Board)
was still in the process of providing guidance on consolidation of such special purpose
entities. The International Accounting Standards Board had no standard that directly
addressed such entities.
Subsequently the US regulators and the IASB strengthened their rules relating to
special purpose entities, to bring more of these entities into group ﬁnancial statements.
Despite these efforts at improvement, the use of special purpose entities, to take
transactions off the balance sheet, became a concern again during the ﬁnancial crisis
of 2007–08. Some of the problems experienced in the banking sector had remained out
of sight in off-balance sheet arrangements. The leading world economies, through the
G20, asked the standard setters to address the continuing problems associated with
off-balance sheet ﬁnance. The IASB responded in 2011 with three new accounting
standards, covering consolidated ﬁnancial statements, joint arrangements and dis-
closures of interests in other entities. The IASB claimed these changes would provide a
check on off-balance sheet activities and would give investors a much clearer picture
of the nature and extent of a company’s involvement with other entities. The detail is
beyond the scope of a ﬁrst-level textbook but this outline shows why annual reports
are becoming ever more lengthy and detailed.
Off-balance-sheet finance is one example of information which would never come to the
attention of the users of financial statements but for the concern of some auditors. Make
a list of other types of information which may be evident to the auditors but which are
unlikely to be conveyed to the readers. Consider this list in the light of the requirement
that financial statements must show a true and fair view. To what extent is the reader 
of financial statements reliant on the directors and the auditors?
14.6 Corporate social responsibility
Corporate social responsibility means that entities report to stakeholders on the ways in
which social and environmental concerns are integrated with their business operations.
Definition
Corporate social responsibility means that companies integrate social and
environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interactions with
stakeholders.
Companies disclose in their annual reports more information than is represented
only in ﬁnancial statements. Depending on social attitudes or pressures, companies
may voluntarily disclose additional information intended to conﬁrm the company’s
sense of social responsibility. In some instances, the provisions of law eventually 
catch up with the values of society and disclosures become mandatory. Section 14.2.5
explains that in the UK the OFR Regulation requires the OFR to include information
about environmental matters and social and community issues.

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
392
Investors are increasingly asking questions about the corporate social responsi-
bility of the companies in which they invest. Many investors want to be reassured that
the businesses in which they have a stake adopt ethical business practices towards
employees, the community and the environment. You will see increasing numbers of
what are described as ‘ethical investment funds’ which make careful enquiry before
buying shares. Some ethical investors feel that they are best placed to inﬂuence a com-
pany if they become shareholders; others feel that they should not become shareholders
until the company has a sound policy.
14.6.1
Types of disclosure
Examples of social disclosure on mandatory topics include: information about pen-
sions for employees, employees’ share option schemes, policy regarding employment
of disabled persons, donations to charity and consultation with employees. Social dis-
closure on a voluntary basis includes: information about employee matters, health and
safety, community work, energy and the environment.
In terms of relative volume, the amount of information disclosed about employee-
related matters exceeds other types of social and environmental disclosures, but the
area where there is the fastest growth in interest is that of environmental issues. Many
leading companies now have an ‘environment’ section in the annual report and some
go even further in producing a separate environmental report.
Below are extracts from the ‘environment’ section of the report of the directors of
Safe and Sure plc, the company used for illustration throughout this text.
Safe and Sure is committed to the provision of services and products which improve the 
quality of life, both for our customers and the community, using working practices designed
to protect the environment.
Heightened awareness of environmental issues and increased legislation provide a focal
point for developing greener techniques and solutions to problems, both in our more tra-
ditional businesses and also in offering opportunities to develop new businesses.
Antibacterial deep cleaning of premises, in particular high-risk areas such as washrooms,
drains and food production and preparation areas, has been developed to meet increased leg-
islation and concern as to health and food safety.
It is the responsibility of the company and all its employees to ensure that all services and
products are procured, produced, packaged and delivered, and waste materials ultimately
disposed of, in ways which are appropriate from an environmental viewpoint. It is the
responsibility of our employees to carry out their work in a manner that will not cause 
damage to the environment.
14.6.2
Need for measurement
Social and environmental disclosures in annual reports have so far centred on narrative
description in the directors’ report or in the non-statutory part of the document. There
is little evidence of impact on the accounting numbers but that may be the next step.
Environmental obligations create liabilities. An oil rig in the North Sea will eventually
have to be removed. The liability may be regarded as existing now because the event
creating the obligation was the original act of positioning the rig in the oil ﬁeld. But
what will eventual removal cost? Will the rig be dismantled to a few hundred feet
below the surface, out of the way of ﬁshing nets? Will it be dismantled down to the sea
bed with the debris left behind? Will the rig be towed away for dismantling elsewhere?
Until these questions can be answered, the liability cannot be measured as a money
amount and therefore cannot be recognised in the statement of ﬁnancial position (bal-
ance sheet). Most oil companies make a provision each year towards the ultimate cost
of removal of the rig and they accumulate the provision in the statement of ﬁnancial
position (balance sheet). They do not, in general, report the full liability at the outset.

14.6.3
The Global Reporting Initiative
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a venture that was started through a link
between the United Nations Environmental Programme and a US body called the
Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies. It has developed into a global
institution that sets out a disclosure framework, called the GRI Guidelines, for sus-
tainability reporting. Companies are increasingly referring to the GRI Guidelines in
designing parts of their annual report. The recommendations include reporting on
vision and strategy, the proﬁle of the organisation, the governance structure and 
management system and performance indicators. These indicators should cover 
economic, environmental and social performance. This combination is sometimes
referred to in the press as ‘the triple bottom line’. The reason for this description is 
that for many years the earnings for equity holders has been described as ‘the bottom
line’ (of the income statement): extending to three performance measures leads to a
triple bottom line.
14.6.4
Climate change accounting
International agreements on supporting sustainable development have consequences
for accounting. One example is seen in the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement resulting
from a conference held in Kyoto, Japan in 1997 as an amendment to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Kyoto Protocol set out 
measures for dealing with problems of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. Some countries were more reluctant than others to ratify the agreement
(conﬁrm that they will make it operational) although gradually more countries have
agreed. All member states of the EU have ratiﬁed the Protocol.
The Kyoto agreement requires action to be taken to reduce carbon-based emissions
(particularly carbon dioxide) over a deﬁned timescale. Countries are given limits of
emissions of greenhouse gases. The countries then set limits on companies in speciﬁed
industries.
One interesting feature of the Kyoto agreement is that companies are given
‘allowances to emit’. The allowance, in the form of a licence, is capable of being trans-
ferred from one company to another. The entity that buys a licence to emit acquires 
an asset. This in turn creates new assets and liabilities for individual companies. 
The liabilities are easier to see: companies which do not reduce emissions will face
penalties. However, there are also opportunities to take actions that prevent emissions
and extract value from the new carbon market. If these actions meet the deﬁnition and
recognition criteria, they are regarded as assets. The European Union Greenhouse Gas
Emissions Trading Scheme began in January 2005. It establishes a market in carbon
dioxide gas emissions for companies in speciﬁed industry sectors. Information on
emissions trading is seen in annual reports published from 2005 onwards.
There is no international accounting standard dealing directly with accounting for
the environment and sustainable development but there are interested groups working
on the accounting issues in various countries.
A survey of accounting practices11 observed in annual reports found that many
companies report the asset of emissions allowances as an intangible asset measured 
at cost. If the allowances are granted by the government then the cost to the com-
pany is zero. Only when allowances are purchased does a cost appear. Fair value is 
an alternative method of measurement but is rarely used. The obligation to deliver 
up allowances to match emissions of the period is generally reported at the cost of 
the allowances granted, which is zero. In a cost-based system the obligation only 
has a measured value if there are excess emissions requiring the company to pur-
chase additional allowances. Fair value could be used as an alternative but is rarely
found.

Activity 14.3

Write down the accounting equation: Assets minus Liabilities equals Ownership interest.
Suppose you are the accountant for an oil company and you have been asked to record
the full liability for dismantling an oil rig in 20 years’ time. How would you make the
accounting equation balance?
14.7 Corporate governance
The term corporate governance is used to describe the way in which companies are
directed and controlled. In Chapter 1 the idea of stewards and their agents was put
forward brieﬂy as a model of the relationship between shareholders and the directors
of a company. It could be argued that these two groups could be left together to work
out their fate, but a series of well-publicised corporate failures and ﬁnancial scandals
of the 1980s raised concern that such a system does not always work and the public
interest may suffer as a result.
There has therefore been considerable interest in intervening to improve the 
quality of corporate governance. The issue has been high on the agenda in several of the
English-speaking countries and the ideas have strong international interest although
perhaps translated into different words and phrases.
14.7.1
The UK Corporate Governance Code
In the UK, the government has taken some action through legislation but has largely
followed the traditional route of encouraging the self-regulatory approach. The self-
regulatory approach is outlined in section 4.5.4 in Chapter 4. The origin of this self-
regulatory approach was the 1992 report of what is usually referred to as the Cadbury
Committee.12
The Cadbury Committee was set up by the Financial Reporting Council, the
London Stock Exchange and the accountancy profession. It was asked to report on a
range of issues concerned with the way directors run their companies and auditors
monitor those companies, considering also the links between directors, auditors and
shareholders. The recommendations of the Cadbury Committee were wide-ranging
but included proposed improvements in ﬁnancial reporting such as:
l more detail in the interim reports
l clearer information about directors’ remuneration
l effective use of the operating and ﬁnancial review
l the effectiveness of the internal control procedures used by the business
l reassurance that the business is a going concern
l a statement of the responsibilities of directors.
Although the report was issued in 1992 it took some time for further working 
parties to agree on the manner of reporting on internal controls and the going concern
conﬁrmation. By the end of 1995 these were in place and 1996 saw the start of a review
of the ﬁrst three years of implementing the Cadbury Report.
The review was chaired by Sir Ronald Hampel, so that the report which eventually
appeared in 1998 was called ‘The Hampel Report’.13 It took as its starting point the
view that good corporate governance was not merely a matter of complying with a
number of hard and fast rules. There was seen to be a need for broad principles. It 
was important to take account of the diversity of circumstances and experience among
companies, and within the same company over time. On this basis Hampel suggested
that the true safeguard for good corporate governance lay in the application of
informed and independent judgement by experienced and qualiﬁed individuals –

Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance
395
executive and non-executive directors, shareholders and auditors. Relatively little was
said about ﬁnancial reporting, beyond the assertion that the board of directors should
present a balanced and understandable assessment of the company’s position and
prospects.
Following the Hampel Report, the Stock Exchange issued a Combined Code for
listed companies containing recommendations on directors; directors’ remuneration;
relations with shareholders; and accountability and audit. The accountability section
emphasised the responsibilities of directors in respect of ﬁnancial reporting. They
should present a balanced and understandable assessment of the company’s position
and prospects. In particular they should explain their responsibilities and they should
also report that the business is a going concern.
The Combined Code was subsequently taken into the responsibility of the Financial
Reporting Council. It is now called the UK Corporate Governance Code. Companies
must report on how they have applied the code in their annual report and accounts.
The information provided by companies in their annual reports is based on the
principle of ‘comply or explain’, ﬁrst set out in the Cadbury Report. The Listing Rules
of the London Stock Exchange require that companies should report whether they
have followed the recommendations of the Code. If they have not done so, they should
explain the reason. Companies with a Premium Listing (see section 4.5.5) must pro-
vide a ‘comply or explain’ statement in the annual report explaining how the company
has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Most companies have a separate ‘Corporate Governance’ section in their annual
report. This section tends to grow longer each year as more headings are added. The
detailed nature of most Corporate Governance sections suggests that companies are
moving closer to a practice of ‘comply and explain’ rather than the principle of ‘com-
ply or explain’. The following typical list of headings is extracted from the Corporate
Governance section of an annual report:
l Introduction
l Putting governance into practice
l The Board
l Non-executive Directors
l Board Committees
l Board meetings
l Attendance at meetings
l Induction, development and support
l Election of directors
l Board performance evaluation
l Relations with shareholders
l Internal control
l Performance reporting and information
l Review of effectiveness of internal control.
14.7.2
Directors’ remuneration
There is a continuing interest in the subject of directors’ remuneration, partly because
it provides opportunities for newspaper headlines. Typically the interest of ﬁnancial
journalists focuses on the salary of the highest paid director and the amount that 
person is gaining through share option schemes. These schemes allow directors to
obtain each year the option to buy shares at an agreed price. If the share price rises
subsequently the directors exercise the option, buy the share at the agreed price and
may sell immediately at a proﬁt. Some companies offer such options to some or all of
their employees by way of encouraging loyalty to the company and supplementing
cash salaries. There are constant questions about whether remuneration is justiﬁed by
meeting performance targets.

Activity 14.4
Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
396
In response to well-publicised concerns about the need to disclose and control the
level of directors’ remuneration, a study group chaired by Sir Richard Greenbury
(1995) produced a code of best practice on disclosure and remuneration policy.14 These
recommendations are now incorporated partly in the Companies Act 2006 and partly
in the Corporate Governance Code. A typical annual report of a listed company con-
tains several pages on the remuneration policy and the payments to directors. There
is a particular focus on how performance targets are set and monitored.
Obtain the annual report of a listed company. Turn to the report on corporate governance.
What does the company say about corporate governance and about compliance with the
Corporate Governance Code? What do the auditors say about the report on corporate
governance? What is disclosed about the remuneration committee? What information is
given elsewhere in the annual report, relating to directors’ remuneration?
14.8 Meaning of ‘present fairly’ and ‘true and fair view’
The IASB system of accounting requires ﬁnancial statements to present fairly the ﬁnan-
cial position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows of an entity.15 In virtually all cir-
cumstances a fair presentation is achieved by compliance with the applicable IFRSs.16
Entities cannot use notes or explanatory material to compensate for inappropriate
accounting policies – the choice of policies must in itself achieve a fair presentation.17
In the extremely rare circumstances where management considers that compliance with
a requirement of an IFRS would conﬂict with the objective of a fair presentation, the
entity will depart from the requirement and explain the reasons and consequences.18
The Companies Act 2006 requires that ﬁnancial statements of companies should
show a true and fair view.19 In most situations a company will achieve a true and fair
view by following the requirements of company law and UK accounting standards. In
the rare circumstances where management considers that compliance with a require-
ment of law and standards would conﬂict with the true and fair view, the entity will
depart from that requirement and explain the reasons and consequences.
14.8.1
Equivalence of meaning
The question arises as to whether ‘present fairly’ and ‘a true and fair view’ have dif-
ferent meanings. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC)20 has obtained legal opinion
that ‘present fairly’ and ‘true and fair view’ are not different requirements. They are
different ways of expressing the same concept. The FRC has also pointed out that the
IASB Framework equates ‘true and fair view’ and ‘fair presentation’ in asserting that
the application of the principal qualitative characteristics and of appropriate account-
ing standards normally results in ﬁnancial statements that convey what is generally
understood as a true and fair view or a fair presentation of information.21
The remainder of this section discusses the meaning of ‘true and fair view’ because
it has a longer history of debate and development in the UK. The phrase ‘true and fair’
was taken into European Directives when the UK joined as a member state but it has
never found an exact equivalent in the underlying meaning. For example the French
wording ‘image ﬁdèle’ is closer to ‘a faithful picture’.
The UK has traditionally taken the position that it may be necessary for individual
companies to take action which contravenes legal rules, in the interest of presenting ‘a
true and fair view’. In other countries, including the US, the position taken is gener-
ally that the law prevails and any questions about fair presentation should be analysed
within the legal framework. The US wording is ‘faithful representation’.

Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance
397
14.8.2
Meaning of a true and fair view
The UK Companies Act provides no deﬁnition of the meaning of ‘a true and fair view’.
Consequently from time to time those who set accounting standards have sought 
the opinion of expert legal advisers. The lawyers have put forward the view that the
requirement for a true and fair view is a dynamic concept which changes its nature as
the general values of society change. Although the words stay the same, the meaning
of the words changes because the opinions of society in general change.
What does that mean in practice? The lawyers have provided an example.22 The Bill
of Rights 1688 prohibited ‘cruel and unusual punishments’. The dictionary deﬁnition
of ‘cruel’ has changed little since that time but a judge today would characterise as
‘cruel’ some punishments which a judge of 1688 would not have regarded as cruel.
The meaning of the word remains the same but the facts to which it is applied have
changed. Based on reasoning of that type, the lawyers have argued that the words
‘true and fair’ may carry the same dictionary meaning from one time to another but
the accounting principles and practice contributing to a true and fair view will change
as circumstances change.
One very important issue is the question of whether society, and the public interest,
would expect the application of accounting standards to be necessary as evidence of
intent to apply a true and fair view. Legal advice provided to the ASB analysed the
role of an accounting standard:
What is the purpose of an accounting standard? The initial purpose is to identify proper
accounting practice for the beneﬁt of preparers and auditors of accounts. However, because
accounts commonly comply with accounting standards, the effect of the issue of standards
has also been to create a common understanding between users and preparers of accounts as
to how particular items should be treated in accounts and accordingly an expectation that,
save where good reason exists, accounts will comply with applicable accounting standards.23
Accounting standards have, over a period of years, become regarded as an 
authoritative source of accounting practice. The legal opinion given to the ASB is 
that accounting standards provide very strong evidence of the proper practice 
which should be adopted. The ‘true and fair view’ is seen as a dynamic concept:
Thus what is required to show a true and fair view is subject to continuous rebirth and in
determining whether the true and fair requirement is satisﬁed the Court will not in my view
seek to ﬁnd synonyms for the words ‘true and fair’ but will seek to apply the concepts which
those words imply.24
14.8.3
Who is responsible for the true and fair view?
Under company law, it is the directors who are responsible for ensuring that the
accounts are prepared in such a way as to show a true and fair view. The auditors state
whether, in their opinion, the accounts show a true and fair view. If you turn back 
to Chapter 4 you will see an example of the statement of directors’ responsibilities
which now appears in many company reports and also a copy of the auditors’ report.
Both contain the phrase ‘a true and fair view’ and emphasise the different types of
responsibility held by directors and auditors.
14.8.4
How specific is the ‘true and fair’ concept?
You should have gained an understanding, from various chapters of this book, that
there is more than one accounting treatment for many transactions and events. It is a
great puzzle to many people that companies could produce different accounting state-
ments for one particular period of time, each of which would show a true and fair
view. The answer lies in one very small word. The requirement of law is for ‘a true and

Activity 14.5
Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
398
fair view’ but not for ‘the true and fair view’. Thus the directors do not have to ﬁnd
‘the very best true and fair view’, which may surprise some users of ﬁnancial state-
ments. It also becomes very difﬁcult for auditors to enter into dispute with directors
where there are two acceptable alternatives, either of which could result in a true and
fair view. To be successful in contradicting the directors, the auditors need to show
that a particular practice does not show a true and fair view. If they can successfully
argue that opinion then the company has the choice of revising the proposed treat-
ment or facing a qualiﬁed audit opinion. Here is an example of a qualiﬁed audit 
opinion where the auditor and directors were in disagreement:
Qualiﬁed audit opinion
We found that the company has made no provision for doubtful debts, despite circumstances
which indicate that such a provision is necessary.
In our opinion the accounts do not give a true and fair view . . .
It is therefore essential, in reading the annual report, to read the auditors’ report at
an early stage in order to be aware of any problems with the ﬁnancial statements. It is
also essential to realise that the meaning of ‘true and fair’ is highly subjective and
changes over a period of time.
Looking back through Chapters 8 to 12, identify matters of accounting practice where
more than one accounting policy is permitted. If you were an auditor, how would you
decide whether one or other of the permitted choices gave a true and fair view?
14.9 Measurement of value
Throughout the majority of this ﬁnancial accounting text the value of assets and liab-
ilities has been measured at historical cost. That means the price paid, or the liability
agreed, when the transaction was ﬁrst undertaken. In times when prices are changing,
that information about the cost at the date of the transaction will become less relevant
to the needs of users (although it may be seen as a reliable measure). The IASB Conceptual
Framework says relatively little about measurement,25 perhaps because of the difﬁculties
of obtaining international agreement. A useful overview is provided by the ICAEW.26
14.9.1
Stages of recognition and measurement
At the moment when the transaction takes place, the historical cost is also the current
value, where current value is regarded as the value of the item at the accounting date.
This is identiﬁed as the point of initial recognition. If an asset or a liability is involved,
then there will be various points at which it may be appropriate to remeasure the
amount at which the asset or liability is recorded. This is referred to as subsequent
remeasurement. Finally there may come a point at which the asset or liability should
be removed from the ﬁnancial statements. This is referred to as derecognition.
The conditions to be applied in deciding on initial recognition have been explained
in Chapter 2. Derecognition reverses the conditions so that an asset or a liability
should cease to be recognised if there is no longer sufﬁcient evidence that the entity
has access to future economic beneﬁts or an obligation to transfer economic beneﬁts.27
14.9.2
Limitations of historical cost accounting
Throughout this text you have studied historical cost accounting where the acqui-
sition of assets is recorded at the amount paid at the time of acquisition. The academic

Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance
399
literature is bursting at the seams with criticisms of historical cost accounting, but the 
practice has proved hard to change. There were brief practical attempts in the UK to
apply a different approach for a period from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s but the
rate of inﬂation then became less of a problem and interest waned.
Critics of historical cost accounting have said that in the statement of ﬁnancial pos-
ition (balance sheet) there is the addition of items bought at different times and with 
£s of different purchasing power. That is not a satisfactory procedure. In the income
statement (proﬁt and loss account) the costs are matched against revenue without
regard for the fact that goods were bought and expenses paid for at an earlier point 
in time. Sales are therefore matched against outdated costs. The tax system takes the
accounting proﬁt as its starting point and therefore the tax payable is dictated by 
outdated accounting ﬁgures.
Supporters of historical cost accounting point to its reliability and objectivity
because the monetary amount of the transaction is known. Veriﬁability is straight-
forward because documentation exists. The preference for historical cost values
remains strong; if companies do decide to revalue ﬁxed assets then both the IASB and
UK ASB require them to keep the current values up to date in each year’s statement 
of ﬁnancial position (balance sheet).28
14.9.3
Subsequent remeasurement
Subsequent remeasurement poses more problems and is one of the more controversial
aspects of setting accounting standards. Each standard sets relevant conditions, with 
a general principle that there should be a change in the amount at which an asset or
liability is recorded if there is sufﬁcient evidence that: (a) the amount has changed and
(b) the new amount can be measured with sufﬁcient reliability.29 In times of inﬂation
(when prices generally are increasing), the idea of remeasurement becomes particu-
larly important. Even when inﬂation is not a major problem, there may be one particu-
lar asset whose value increases through scarcity of supply or decreases through lack
of demand.
That leads into an extremely controversial question: ‘How do you measure value?’
Methods of valuation are listed in the IASB Conceptual Framework,30 but without any
ﬁrm preferences being expressed.
14.9.4
Entry price and exit price
Taking ﬁxed assets and stocks as the main examples to begin with, it could be said that
there are two different categories of measures of value. There is a price which the
organisation will have to pay to acquire the asset and there is a price at which the
organisation will be able to sell the asset to someone else. If you have ever tried 
buying and selling second-hand goods you will know that the buying price and the
selling price are often quite different. The student who tries to sell an outdated per-
sonal computer through an advertisement on the college noticeboard knows that any
enquirer will try to push the price downwards. The student attempting to enquire
about a similar item of equipment knows that the seller will try to keep the price 
high. Somehow the price for which you are able to sell your second-hand possessions
invariably appears to be lower than the price someone else is asking for their
unwanted belongings.
The price paid by a business to acquire an asset is called in accounting the entry
price and the price at which the business would be able to sell the asset is called the
exit price. Academic authors will argue long and hard on both sides of the case and 
if you pursue the study of accounting further you will meet that academic debate. 
In the real world a decision has to be made. In the UK, that decision was made by 
the standard-setting body at the beginning of the 1980s, when SSAP 16 required 

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
400
companies to use the entry price approach and to measure the value of ﬁxed assets
and stocks at the cost of replacement at the date of the ﬁnancial statements. That
approach was used to provide additional information in annual reports of the UK for
the ﬁrst half of the 1980s, but gradually the enthusiasm of companies waned and by the
late 1980s they had reverted to their traditional practice of using primarily historical
cost for most aspects of measurement.
14.9.5
Current values31
In a current value system, changes in value are recorded as they occur. This idea, if
accepted, puts quite a large hole in the concept of realisation, which is at the heart of
traditional accounting practice. It has been the practice to record changes in ownership
interest only when the change in an asset or liability is realised, in the form either of
cash or of other assets the ultimate realisation of which can be assessed with reason-
able certainty. That practice ﬁnds continuing support in the Companies Act 2006
which states that the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) reported under the
Act may report only those proﬁts which are realised (although this requirement does
not apply to companies reporting under full IFRS).
Chapter 12 has explained how some gains and losses on revaluation may be
reported in Other Comprehensive Income. There is an unanswered question of how to
measure current value.
The argument favoured by some commentators in the UK, is the one which leads to
a measurement system based on value to the business. Those who support this idea
start by asking: What is the worst that can happen to a person, or business, which
owns a ﬁxed asset or item of trading stock? The answer is that they may be deprived
of the item, perhaps by theft, ﬁre, obsolescence or similar cause. The next question 
is: What would the owners need in order to be returned to the position they enjoyed
previously? The answer, in most cases, is that they need to be provided with the cost
of replacement of a similar item so that they may continue with the activity of the 
business. In a few rare cases, where the owners may have decided to sell rather than
continue using the asset, the selling price is the measure of deprival.
From this analysis it is argued that the value to the business of a ﬁxed asset or an
item of stock is usually the replacement cost at the accounting date. The replacement
cost is that of a similar item in a similar state. Such a replacement cost might be found
in a catalogue of prices of used equipment or it could be estimated by starting with the
cost of a new item and applying an appropriate proportion of depreciation.
14.9.6
Fair value
The IASB standards have moved towards a fair value approach to valuation rather
than a ‘value to the business’ approach. Several of the standards in the IASB system
permit or require the use of fair value, which to based on exit price.
Definition
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement 
date.32
The deﬁnition of fair value has been agreed between the IASB and the US standard
setter, the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board), taking effect from the start
of 2013. Ideally the price should be found from an active market, in which transactions
for the asset or liability take place with sufﬁcient frequency and volume to provide
pricing information on an ongoing basis. If the company operates in more than one

Activity 14.6
Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance
401
market, then the price should be taken from the market that maximises the amount
that would be received to sell the asset or minimises the amount that would be paid
to transfer the liability, after taking into account transaction costs and transport costs.
In some cases there is no active market for an asset or a liability. The accounting
standard then sets out a sequence of attempts (a ‘hierarchy’) to be followed in decid-
ing on fair value. Companies must explain how they have applied this hierarchy. For
property, plant and equipment33 a company might use depreciated replacement cost
where market-based evidence is not available. For biological assets a range of sugges-
tions is given, such as market price of similar assets or discounted present value of
future cash ﬂows.34
14.9.7
Current practice
In annual reports of UK companies there is a general adherence to historical cost but
some companies show evidence of using revaluation, which is permitted by the UK
ASB as well as by the IASB system.
The International Accounting Standard IAS 16 permits entities to choose either the
cost model or the revaluation model. Under the cost model, property, plant and equip-
ment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Under the revaluation model
an item of property, plant and equipment may be carried at a revalued amount. The
revalued amount is fair value less accumulated depreciation. Revaluations must be
made regularly so that the carrying amount remains close to fair value at the date of
the ﬁnancial statements.
Look at the items you possess. These might include a house or a flat or a car, but equally
well they could be a bicycle and some modest items of furniture. Whatever their nature,
write down on a piece of paper a figure in £s which answers the question: What is the
value of these possessions? Now think about how you arrived at that figure. Did you 
use the original cost because that was the amount you paid to acquire them? Did you 
use replacement cost because that is the amount you would have to pay to replace
them? Did you use selling price because that is the amount you could collect in cash for
conversion to other uses? Did you have some other method? What was the reason for 
the method you chose? Would you obtain the same answer using all the methods listed
for this activity? Which answer is the most relevant for your information needs? Which is
the most reliable? Is there any conflict here between relevance and reliability? Would
other students answer these questions as you have done?
14.10 Risk reporting
One of the major causes of increasing disclosure in annual reports is the need to
explain the risks that the business faces. For UK company reporting there are several
sources of requirements for risk reporting in the notes to the accounts and in the nar-
rative sections of the annual report. Many companies provide additional voluntary
information about risks because they are aware of its importance to investors and
other users of the annual report.
The Business Review regulations require companies to provide information on
description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company. It is for com-
panies to decide how to implement this requirement. The Financial Reporting Review
Panel has repeatedly questioned whether companies meet this regulatory require-
ment. It suggests companies test their disclosures against the following questions:
1 Do the disclosures state clearly which are the principal risks and uncertainties fac-
ing the business?

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
402
2 Are those risks and uncertainties described as principal the main risks and uncer-
tainties that currently face the business? For example, have the risks and uncertain-
ties listed as principal been the subject of recent discussions at board or audit
committee meetings? Are there risks which have been the subject of such dis-
cussions which should be considered as principal?
3 Is the description of each principal risk and uncertainty sufﬁcient for shareholders
to understand the nature of that risk or uncertainty and how it might affect the 
company?
4 Are the principal risks and uncertainties described in a manner consistent with the
way in which they are discussed within the company?
5 Are the principal risks and uncertainties shown consistent with the rest of the
report and accounts? Are there risks and uncertainties on the list which are not
referred to elsewhere or are there signiﬁcant risks and uncertainties discussed else-
where which do not appear on the list?
6 Is there a description, in the directors’ report, or elsewhere in the report and
accounts and explicitly cross-referenced from the directors’ report, of how the com-
pany manages each of the principal risks and uncertainties?
Researchers have found that risk information is important for analysts, professional
and private investors. While the annual report is an important source of risk infor-
mation for the private investor, the professional investors say they prefer one-to-one
meetings with companies to explore risk information. There is a feeling that most of
the information disclosed in the annual report is already known to the well informed
professional investor before the report is published, because these investors keep in
contact with the company on a regular basis. It seems that the information published
is of greatest potential use to the private investor or to persons less closely familiar
with the company.
14.11 Developing issues: how valid is the stakeholder model?
This book takes as its starting point the IASB’s Conceptual Framework, and has con-
stantly returned to that Conceptual Framework for explanation or discussion of the
accounting practices explained in various chapters. The Conceptual Framework is, in its
turn, built on a model which sees the objective of accounting as serving the needs of a
wide range of users. Those users are sometimes referred to as stakeholders and the
Conceptual Framework is regarded as an example of a stakeholder model of the process
of regulating accounting.
There are, however, those who would argue that the stakeholder model is the
wrong place to start and therefore the signiﬁcant problems of accounting will not be
solved using a statement of principles of this type. At the basic level of understanding
existing accounting practice, which is the limit of this book, the validity of one model
versus another may not be a critical issue, but you should be aware that there are
views that more complex accounting problems may not be solved using a stakeholder
approach.
Those who argue against the ‘user needs’ approach suggest that accounting regu-
lation is a much more complex process of social interaction. Standard-setters producing
accounting rules in a self-regulatory environment need to be sure of a consensus of
opinion supporting the proposed rules. They will therefore seek out a range of opinions
and will undoubtedly be subjected to lobbying (letters of comment and personal 
contact) by persons or organisations seeking to put forward a particular viewpoint.
Indeed, part of the UK standard-setting process involves issuing an exposure draft for
comment before a ﬁnancial reporting standard is issued, although there is no way of
knowing what lobbying occurs behind the scenes.

Chapter 14 Reporting corporate performance
403
The process of standard-setting may therefore be regarded as one of negotiating
and balancing various interests. There has been research after the event, both in the
UK and in other countries, which has shown that the standard-setting bodies were
inﬂuenced by one or more powerful forces. One particularly clear example may be
seen in the development of an accounting standard to tighten up practices in reporting
expenditure on research and development.35 There is a signiﬁcant amount of academic
literature on factors inﬂuencing the process of setting accounting standards.
Those who have identiﬁed these ‘political’ pressures would suggest that the
accounting standard-setting process should openly admit that there are inﬂuential 
factors such as: the relative balance of power among those who prepare and those 
who use accounting information; relative dependency of some on others; the balance
of individual liberty against collective need; and the ideology observed in particular
systems of social relations. (Ideology means that a group in society may hold strong
beliefs which make it genuinely unable to appreciate different positions taken by 
others.)
Thus claims that the standard-setting process is neutral in its impact on the econ-
omy or on society may be unrealistic. This book does not seek to impose any particu-
lar view on its readers. It has used the Conceptual Framework as a consistent basis for
explaining current practice, but it leaves to the reader the task of taking forward the
knowledge of external ﬁnancial reporting and the understanding of what inﬂuences
the future development of external ﬁnancial reporting.
14.12 Summary
l The operating and ﬁnancial review (OFR) provides a balanced and comprehensive
analysis of the business, its year-end position, the trends in performance during the
year and factors likely to affect future position and performance. It is good practice
for quoted UK companies.
l A highlights statement in the annual report shows what the company regards 
as important information for investors as the primary users of the annual report. 
A table of ﬁve-year trends is also useful in evaluating the position and performance
of the business.
l Segmental reporting has developed as a means of supplementing the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements by providing more insight into the activities of the group. In
particular it reports information about the different types of products and services
that an entity produces and the different geographical areas in which it operates.
l Off-balance-sheet ﬁnance describes the situation where an asset and a liability 
are omitted from the ﬁnancial statements of an entity. The UK ASB takes the view
that such transactions should remain on the entity’s statement of ﬁnancial pos-
ition (balance sheet) if the risks and rewards remain with the entity. The IASB has
speciﬁc rules to deal with special purpose vehicles, which are one form of off-
balance-sheet ﬁnance.
l Corporate social responsibility means that companies integrate social and environ-
mental concerns in their business operations and in their interactions with stake-
holders. Many companies include social and environmental disclosures in their
annual reports. The Global Reporting Initiative provides a framework for such 
disclosures.
l Carbon trading, arising from the Kyoto Protocol, provides a new form of asset in
the licence to emit carbon dioxide and a new form of liability in the obligation to
reduce emissions.

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
404
l The term corporate governance is used to describe the way in which companies 
are directed and controlled. Listed companies in the UK are required to follow the
Corporate Governance Code. In the annual report the directors must either conﬁrm
compliance with the Code or explain reasons for non-compliance.
l Directors’ remuneration is one aspect of corporate governance that receives a great
deal of attention. There are rules and guidance on the disclosure of remuneration
(pay) policy and the amount due to each director. The information is usually con-
tained in the report of the Remuneration Committee.
l The IASB system of accounting requires ﬁnancial statements to present fairly the
ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows of an entity. The Com-
panies Act 2006 requires that ﬁnancial statements of companies should show a true
and fair view. The Financial Reporting Council has given an opinion that the two
phrases are broadly equivalent.
l There is a continuing debate on the methods of measuring assets and liabilities.
Reliability points towards historical cost accounting but faithful representation
points towards current values.
l Entry price values are values that measure the cost of buying, acquiring or replacing
an asset or liability. Exit price values represent the sale, disposal or other form of
realisation of an asset.
l Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date.
l Finally, it should be noted that this entire book on ﬁnancial accounting has been
built on a stakeholder model of user needs which itself is the basis of the IASB’s
Conceptual Framework. That idea meets general acceptance in the accounting pro-
fession from those who set accounting standards, but you need to be aware that 
further study of the academic literature will encourage you to question the user
needs model.

Activities for study groups
Case 14.1
Turn to the annual report of a listed company which you have used for activities throughout the
previous chapters. Split the group to take two different roles: one half of the group should take
the role of the finance director and the other half should take the role of the broker’s analyst
writing a report on the company.
Look through the annual report for any ratio calculations performed by the company and
check these from the data in the financial statements, so far as you are able. Prepare your own
calculations of ratios for analysis of all aspects of performance. Find the current share price
from a current newspaper.
Once the data preparation is complete, the finance director subgroup should prepare a 
short report to a meeting with the analysts. The analysts should then respond with questions
arising from the ratio analysis. The finance directors should seek to present answers to the
questions using the annual report. Finally write a short report (250 words) on problems encoun-
tered in calculating and interpreting financial ratios.
Case 14.2
Turn to the annual report of a listed company which you have used for activities in previous
chapters. Is this a group? How do you know? Where is the list of subsidiary companies?
If you do not have a group report, obtain another annual report which is for a group of 
companies (nearly all large listed companies operate in group form). As a group, imagine that
you are a team of analysts seeking to break down the component segments of the group for
analytical purposes. How much information can you find about the segments? What are the
problems of defining segments in this group? If you can obtain the annual report for the previous
year, compare the definitions of segments. Are they consistent from one year to the next?
Based on your analysis, prepare a short essay (250 words): ‘The usefulness of segmental
information in the analysis of group performance’.
Case 14.3
Divide the group into sections to take on four different roles: a private shareholder in a com-
pany; a financial journalist; a finance director of a company; and a broker’s analyst providing an
advisory service to clients.
In each section develop your opinion on the subject Taking the user needs perspective will

Reporting cash flows
REAL WORLD CASE
Amazon
One of the joys of Amazon’s business model is that
customers pay straight away while suppliers are paid
later. When a company is growing quickly, this
mismatch (that is, the difference between days
receivable and days payable) feeds through to cash
flows – though this working capital benefit declines 
with maturity.
Because Amazon pays its suppliers much more slowly than it is paid by its customers, in 2011 
it averaged 90 days’ worth of sales in payables (money due to be paid out) versus 16 days in
receivables (money due to come in). Good inventory management also frees up cash. Over the past
five years, these benefits (known as negative working capital) have accounted for almost a third of
Amazon’s free cash flow . . . this working capital benefit will decline when Amazon’s growth slows.
Working capital will not be a significant source of cash flow forever.

15.1 Introduction
The statement of cash ﬂows is one of the primary ﬁnancial statements. It provides
information that can not be seen in the balance sheet and income statement (proﬁt 
and loss account) alone. Users of ﬁnancial statements want to know about changes 
in ﬁnancial position. This involves providing information about an entity’s ability to
generate cash ﬂows and the entity’s use of those cash ﬂows.
Chapter 3 gives a very simple introduction to the statement of cash ﬂows. In par-
ticular it shows why cash ﬂow and proﬁt differ because of the different timings of 
cash ﬂow and proﬁts. Chapter 9 indicates the working capital cycle through which
inventories are acquired from suppliers on credit and sold to customers on credit. The
cash eventually received from customers is used to pay suppliers and the cycle starts
again. Chapter 13 illustrates a statement of cash ﬂows prepared from the statements 
of ﬁnancial position and income statement of the illustrative company used in that
chapter. The case study of Safe and Sure plc runs throughout several chapters with
outline discussion of the statement of cash ﬂows in Chapter 4.
This chapter provides a more thorough explanation of a statement of cash ﬂows 
as presented in the IASB system. It explains in sections 15.2 and 15.3 the nature of the

two choices – the ‘direct’ and the ‘indirect’ methods. Section 15.4 explains the nature
and purpose of each line item of a statement of cash ﬂows prepared using the indirect
system. Section 15.5 explains the nature and purpose of each line item of a statement
of cash ﬂows prepared using the direct system. Section 15.6 presents a worked example
for those who wish to practise preparation of a statement of cash ﬂows based on the
IASB system.1
15.2 Cash and cash equivalents
The IASB system2 presents a statement of cash ﬂows that explains changes in cash and
cash equivalents.
Definitions
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in
value.3
Cash is relatively easy to understand – it is cash that is immediately available. Cash
equivalents are investments that are held to meet short-term commitments. To qualify
as a cash equivalent the investment must be readily convertible to a known amount of
cash and there must be an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value. An investment
qualiﬁes as a cash equivalent only when it has a short maturity of, say, three months
or less from the date of acquisition.4
Bank borrowings are generally considered to be ﬁnancing activities. However, bank
overdrafts that are repayable on demand are part of the cash management of a busi-
ness. The bank balance ﬂuctuates from a positive balance to an overdrawn balance at
different times of the year.5
15.3 The direct method and the indirect method
There are two approaches to presenting the cash ﬂows arising from operations. The
direct method presents cash inﬂows from customers and cash outﬂows to suppliers
and employees, taken from the entity’s accounting records of cash receipts and pay-
ments. The indirect method starts with the operating proﬁt and makes a series of
adjustments to convert proﬁt to cash. The data in Table 15.1 and Table 15.2 are used to
illustrate each method.

15.3.1
Direct method
The direct method reports the cash inﬂows from customers and cash outﬂows to 
suppliers, employees and other aspects of operations. This information is contained in
the cash book or in the cash receipts and cash payments records used as input to the
bookkeeping records in the general ledger. The direct method calculation is presented
in Table 15.3. It is followed by a comment on each line in the calculation.

General comment. In the direct method the cash ﬂows are taken from the cash records.
The cash records have to be analysed into categories suitable for the statement of 
cash ﬂows. In Chapters 5 and 6 you have seen spreadsheets in which the cash record
is the ‘cash at bank’ column. That column was used as the basis for the simple state-
ment of cash ﬂows on the direct method illustrated in those chapters (see sections 5.5.1
and 6.6.1). This chapter does not provide the detail of the cash records of receipts and
payments but the following comments explain how the cash ﬁgures can be conﬁrmed
from the information in the balance sheet and the income statement (proﬁt and loss
account).
Cash received from customers. The cash inﬂows from customers may be conﬁrmed by
starting with the revenue earned in the period. Some of the revenue has been earned
from selling to customers on credit. The amounts receivable from customers (debtors)
at the start of the period will have been collected in cash during the period. The amounts
shown as receivable from customers (debtors) at the end of the period are the revenue
not yet collected in cash. This analysis is presented in the following calculation:

Add receivables at the start of the period

Cash paid to suppliers. The cash outﬂows to suppliers may be conﬁrmed by starting
with the materials purchased in the period. Some of the purchases have been obtained
from suppliers on credit. The amounts payable to suppliers (creditors) at the start of the
period will have been paid in cash during the period. The amounts shown as payable
to suppliers (creditors) at the end of the period are the payments not yet made.
The next question is – how to conﬁrm the ﬁgure for purchases?
The purchases of materials are needed to supply the goods sold and to provide an
inventory at the end of the period. If there is an inventory (stock) at the start of the
period this reduces the need to make purchases. This analysis is presented in the 
following calculation:
£m
Cost of materials sold in the period
40
Add inventory at the end of the period
55
Less inventory at the start of the period

Wages paid. Usually the wages are paid as soon as the work is done so the amount
shown for wages in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account) is the same as the
cash payment. To conﬁrm the wages payment, if any amount of wages remains
unpaid at the start or end of the period then the wages cost must be adjusted for these
unpaid amounts in a manner similar to the calculation of cash paid to suppliers.
15.3.2
Indirect method
The indirect method starts with the operating proﬁt and makes adjustments to arrive
at cash ﬂow from operations. The indirect method calculation is presented in Table 15.4.
It is followed by an explanation of each line in the calculation.

Operating proﬁt. This ﬁgure is taken from the income statement in Table 15.1.
Add back depreciation. Depreciation is an accounting expense that does not involve any
ﬂow of cash. It is an allocation of the cost of the non-current (ﬁxed) asset. So if we are
looking for the cash generated by making proﬁts, this depreciation needs to be
excluded. It was deducted as an expense to calculate proﬁt, so now it is added back to
exclude it.
(Increase) in inventory. When a business acquires inventory it uses up cash. The cash is
recovered when the inventory is sold. The greater the build-up of inventory, the
greater the amount of cash that the business is waiting to recover. So an increase 
in inventory uses cash. A decrease in inventory releases cash and so is a source of 
cash.
Decrease in receivables. When a business sells goods or services to customers on credit
it has to wait to collect the cash. The greater the increase in receivables (debtors) the
greater is the amount of cash that the business is waiting to collect. So an increase in
receivables has the effect of decreasing cash ﬂow. A decrease in receivables releases
cash and so is a source of cash.
(Decrease) in payables. When a business buys goods or services from suppliers on credit
it delays payment of the cash. The greater the increase in payables (creditors) the
greater is the amount of cash payment that the business is delaying. So an increase in
payables has the effect of increasing cash ﬂow by postponing payments. A decrease in
payables means that suppliers are being paid sooner and so is equivalent to a use of
cash.
Change in cash in the statement of ﬁnancial position. Finally it is important to check that
the cash ﬂow matches the change in cash in the statement of ﬁnancial position.
Looking at the statements of ﬁnancial position in Table 15.2 you will see that the cash
has increased from £10m to £35m which equals the positive cash ﬂow of £25m calcu-
lated by both the direct and the indirect method.
15.3.3
Which to choose – direct or indirect?
When students are asked at this point whether they prefer the direct or the indirect
method they usually choose the direct method because it looks less cumbersome. In
practice almost all companies choose the indirect method because it can be prepared
from the opening and closing statements of ﬁnancial position and the income state-
ment (proﬁt and loss account). Some supporters also argue that it is useful to highlight
the effect of working capital on cash ﬂows.
The direct method needs more work to identify all the operating ﬂows from the 
cash records. Bookkeeping records, as illustrated in the supplements to previous 
chapters in this book, are based on ledger accounts which include non-cash items. The
sales ledger account, for example, combines cash sales and credit sales. All expense
accounts combine expenses paid in cash and expenses obtained on credit. In practice
the direct method creates additional work in analysing the accounting records, because
there are many aspects to operating cash ﬂow. Supporters of cash ﬂow reporting 
advocate the direct method because it gives a clearer picture of cash ﬂows. It also 
provides information on details of cash ﬂows that is not available under the indirect
method.
The standard-setters recognise that there are valid arguments for and against each
method and so continue to permit both. The IASB ‘encourages’ entities to report cash
ﬂow from operating activities using the direct method,6 but this encouragement
appears to have been ineffective in many cases.

15.4 Preparing a statement of cash flows: the indirect method
Most companies prepare their statement of cash ﬂows using the indirect method. This
means they start with the reported operating proﬁt and then make adjustments to
work back to the cash amounts that are incorporated in proﬁt and in working capital.
This section explains the indirect method. A format for a statement of cash ﬂows is
presented in Table 15.5. Line numbers have been added at the left-hand side. Each line
is explained in the section following Table 15.5.
Line 1 Cash flows from operating activities
This line indicates the start of the ﬁrst major section of the statement of cash ﬂows,
showing how cash ﬂows are generated from the operations of the business.
Line 2 Profit before taxation
The indirect method always starts with the operating proﬁt before deducting interest
and taxation, taken from the income statement (proﬁt and loss account). This is
because interest is seen as a separate payment to reward lenders and taxation is 
seen as a separate outﬂow of cash to government which needs to be emphasised. If the
operating proﬁt includes any investment income or interest received this must also be

Line 3 Adjustment for items not involving a flow of cash
The ﬁnance director now looks at the proﬁt ﬁgure and asks, ‘Are there any items in
here that do not involve a ﬂow of cash? If so we want to remove these so that we can
get closer to cash.’ Most income statements (proﬁt and loss accounts) contain depre-
ciation and amortisation, which have no effect on cash. Other items to look out for are
changes in provisions, unrealised gains and losses on foreign currency translation.
Line 4 Adding back depreciation, amortisation, gain or loss on disposal etc
So the depreciation and amortisation are ‘added back’ to remove them from the proﬁt
ﬁgure. This usually causes some problems for readers of a statement of cash ﬂows. If
it worries you, just ask yourself – how did the depreciation get in there in the ﬁrst
place? The answer is that it was deducted as an expense, so if we add it back we
exclude the expense. Other items that could come under this heading of ‘not involving
a ﬂow of cash’ are changes in provisions charged through income statement and gains
or losses calculated on disposal of a non-current (ﬁxed) asset. The following table 
summarises the action to be taken in the statement of cash ﬂows:

so must be excluded by deducting.
Line 5 Adjusted profit
In some presentations of the statement of cash ﬂows this line is not shown separately,
but it is a useful subtotal to remind yourself that you have now removed all non-cash
items and you are ready to think about how working capital changes affect cash ﬂow
from operations.
Line 6 (Increase)/decrease in inventories (stocks)
When a business buys inventories of raw materials or produces work in progress and
ﬁnished goods, it uses up cash. The cash is only recovered when the inventories are
sold. While the inventories are increasing the cash invested in them is increasing and
there is a negative impact on cash ﬂow.

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
416
The following table summarises the action to be taken in the statement of cash
ﬂows:
Item in calculation
Reason
Deduct increase in inventories
Allowing inventories to increase takes up 
more cash in paying for them, or prevents 
cash being obtained through sale.
Add decrease in inventories
Allowing inventories to decrease reduces 
the cash needed to pay for them, or 
allows cash to be obtained through sale.
Line 7 (Increase)/decrease in trade receivables (debtors)
When a business sells goods and services on credit to customers, these customers are
given some time to pay. They become debtors of the business until they pay cash.
Selling goods and services on credit encourages customers to buy from the business
but it delays the ﬂow of cash to the business. The longer the period of credit taken by
customers, the longer the delay. The danger of allowing the period of credit to increase
is that the customer may become increasingly reluctant to pay. Chapter 13 explains
how to estimate the average period of credit taken by credit customers.
The following table summarises the action to be taken in the statement of cash
ﬂows:
Item in calculation
Reason
Deduct increase in receivables
Allowing amounts of receivables to 
increase means that cash is not being 
collected from credit customers.
Add decrease in receivables
Allowing amounts of receivables to 
decrease means that cash is being 
collected faster from credit customers.
Line 8 (Increase)/decrease in prepayments
When a business makes payments for expenses in advance of enjoying the beneﬁt of
the payment, there is an outﬂow of cash. Examples are rent in advance or insurance
premiums in advance (see Chapter 9 for the accounting treatment of prepayments). 
If the business is making more prepayments, there is a greater outﬂow of cash. If the
business reduces its prepayments the cash ﬂow position improves.
The following table summarises the action to be taken in the statement of cash
ﬂows:
Item in calculation
Reason
Deduct increase in prepayments
If prepayments increase then more cash 
is being used to make payments in 
advance.
Add decrease in prepayments
If prepayments decrease then less cash 
is being used to make payments in 
advance.

Chapter 15 Reporting cash flows
417
Line 9 Increase/(decrease) in cash due to (increases)/decreases in 
current assets
This line adds all the increases in current assets and deducts all the decreases in 
current assets. If the current assets have increased in total then the cash ﬂow has
decreased. If the current assets have decreased in total then the cash ﬂow has
increased. It is good practice to delete the alternative words here that do not apply to
the particular circumstances of the company. Some published statements of cash ﬂows
leave all the words in the statement but this can be very confusing to readers.
Line 10 Increase/(decrease) in trade payables (creditors)
When a business buys goods or services on credit, the supplier often allows a period
of credit. This helps the cash ﬂow of the business in the gap between buying inputs
and selling outputs of goods or services. The longer the period of credit taken from the
supplier, the better the effect on cash ﬂow. The danger of delaying payment beyond
an agreed date is that the supplier may refuse to supply more goods or services and
may even begin legal action for recovery of amounts owing. Chapter 13 explains how
to calculate the average period of credit taken from suppliers.
The following table summarises the action to be taken in the statement of cash
ﬂows:
Item in calculation
Reason
Deduct decrease in payables
Allowing amounts of payables to 
decrease means that more cash is being 
paid to suppliers and other creditors.
Add increase in payables
Allowing amounts of payables to increase 
means that less cash is being paid to 
suppliers and other creditors.
Line 11 Increase/(decrease) in accruals
Accruals is the general description for unpaid expenses. If a business delays paying
expenses there is a beneﬁt for cash ﬂow. If the accruals increase then there is a greater
beneﬁt for cash ﬂow. The danger of delaying payment beyond an agreed date is that
the supplier may refuse to supply more goods or services and may even begin legal
action for recovery of amounts owing.
The following table summarises the action to be taken in the statement of cash
ﬂows:
Item in calculation
Reason
Deduct decrease in accruals
Allowing amounts of unpaid expenses 
(accruals) to decrease means that 
more cash is being paid to settle these 
obligations.
Add increase in accruals
Allowing amounts of unpaid expenses 
(accruals) to increase means that less 
cash is being paid to settle these 
obligations.

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
418
Line 12 Increase/(decrease) in cash due to increases/(decreases) 
in liabilities
This line adds all the increases in current liabilities and deducts all the decreases in
current liabilities. If the current liabilities have increased in total then the cash ﬂow has
beneﬁted – less cash has been paid to settle current liabilities. If the current liabilities
have decreased in total then the cash ﬂow has suffered – more cash has been paid to
settle liabilities. It is good practice to delete the alternative words here that do not
apply to the particular circumstances of the company. Some published statements 
of cash ﬂows leave all the words in the statement but this can be very confusing to
readers.
Line 13 Increase/(decrease) in cash due to working capital changes
This line shows the result of comparing the change in current assets with the change
in current liabilities. There are several combinations of increases and decreases 
in current assets and liabilities so the easiest way to think about the outcome is to 
ask ‘what has happened to working capital (current assets less current liabilities) 
overall?’
If the working capital has increased, then cash flow has decreased.
If the working capital has decreased, then cash flow has increased.
Line 14 Cash generated from operations
This is a subtotal combining the cash ﬂow effect of the adjusted proﬁt and the cash
ﬂow effect of the changes in working capital.
Line 15 Interest paid
Interest must be paid on loans. If it is not paid on time the lender will take action to
demand payment of the interest and might even demand immediate repayment of the
loan in full, depending on the conditions of the loan agreement. The interest expense
in the income statement represents the interest cost of the accounting period but if the
payment dates fall outside the accounting period there may be an accrual of unpaid
interest in the statement of ﬁnancial position. A calculation is required to arrive at the
amount of cash paid during the accounting period.

There is a corporation tax expense in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account).
The due dates for payment depend on the size of the company, as explained in
Chapter 10. Any unpaid taxation at the start or end of the period will appear as a 
liability in the statement of ﬁnancial position. A calculation is required to arrive at the
amount of tax paid in the accounting period.

Line 18 Cash flows from investing activities
This line starts the second major section of the statement of cash ﬂows showing how
cash has been used for making new investment in non-current assets and also released
from sales of existing investment in non-current assets.
Line 19 Purchase of non-current assets
In many cases the amount spent on non-current assets will be known from the
accounting records. However, if you are preparing a statement of cash ﬂows using
only the statement of ﬁnancial position and income statement plus some notes, you
may ﬁnd that you need to calculate the amount spent on non-current assets. The 
following table summarises the calculation of changes in non-current assets which
includes the cash payment. It assumes that all assets of one type are recorded together
as one category (e.g. vehicles, plant and machinery).

Line 20 Proceeds from sale of non-current assets
This line reports the cash received from sale or disposal of non-current assets. It is
important to use the cash received from the disposal of the asset and not the gain or loss
on disposal recorded in the income statement (proﬁt and loss account). Look back to
Chapter 8 and you will see that the gain or loss on disposal arises only when the cash
received is different from the book value. If the depreciation had been calculated with
perfect foresight then the net book value would be equal to the cash received and there
would be no gain or loss. A gain or loss on disposal is the result of estimating depreci-
ation at the start of the asset’s life when the proceeds on disposal have to be estimated.
The following table summarises the calculation relating to the sale or disposal of
non-current assets which includes the cash received.

Line 21 Interest received
Interest received is a reward for investment and so it is regarded as part of the cash
ﬂows relating to investing activities. Look back to the calculations in the workings for
line 2 and you will see the item:
Is there any interest received/receivable or any dividends received in this figure? If so
deduct it.
The interest receivable is removed in calculating operating proﬁt at line 2 so that
interest received can be inserted at line 21. The following table summarises the action

Line 23 Net cash used in investing activities
This subtotal indicates the end of the second major section of the statement of cash
ﬂows. It will usually be a negative ﬁgure showing that the business is expanding
through more investment in non-current assets. Less commonly, a business may be
selling off existing investments to raise cash for future plans. Having the separate
subtotal draws attention to the magnitude and direction of investing activities.
Line 24 Cash flows from financing activities
This line starts the third and ﬁnal major section of the statement of cash ﬂows showing
how cash has been raised from ﬁnancing activities. This usually means issuing new
share capital and raising or repaying long-term loans.
Line 25 Proceeds from issue of share capital
Chapter 12 explains the process of issuing share capital, both when the business starts
and when it looks for more ﬁnance some time later. In many cases the shares are
issued at market price, which is higher than nominal value. The difference is called a
share premium. The total cash raised is measured in terms of the market price but
company law requires separate reporting of the change in nominal value and the
changes in the share premium. The calculation required is as follows:
Item in calculation
Reason

way through the statement of cash ﬂows. Lines 30 and 31 are taken from the statement
of ﬁnancial position. If your statement of cash ﬂows is correct then line 29 plus line 30
will equal line 31. The following table is used to record the information extracted from

15.5 Preparing a statement of cash flows: the direct method
Line 1 Cash flows from operating activities
This line indicates the start of the ﬁrst major section of the statement of cash ﬂows,
showing how cash ﬂows are generated from the operations of the business.
Line 2 Cash receipts from customers
This line reports the total cash received from customers in the period. Some customers
may have paid immediate cash for goods and services. Others may have taken credit
and paid later.
Line 3 Cash paid to suppliers
This line reports the total cash paid to suppliers in the period. The business may have
paid immediate cash for some goods and services. In other cases the suppliers may
have allowed a period of credit to be paid later.
Line 4 Cash paid to employees
This line reports the total cash paid to employees in the period. Usually the employees
are paid promptly each week or each month and so the cash payments are closely
related to the wages expense.
Lines 14 to 31 have the same meaning as described for these lines in Section 15.4.
The alternative direct method is shown in Table 15.6 and explained as follows.

Chapter 15 Reporting cash flows
423
15.6 Interpretation of cash flow information
The cash ﬂow information is useful in itself in showing trends in the company’s cash
resources. Some businesses operate on cycles lasting several years where the cash
position moves from negative to positive. The industry position is often a useful start-
ing point for understanding company cash ﬂows. If the industry is cyclical and all
companies in the sector have negative cash ﬂow then we might expect any company
in the sector to show the same trends. Equally, any company in the sector should be
showing signs of improvement as the cycle moves upwards.
For the indirect method, which reports the cash ﬂow effects of working capital, 
it may be useful to link the increases or decreases in working capital items to the 
number of days in the working capital cycle. The calculation of the working capital
cycle appears in Chapter 13. For example, if there is an increase in cash invested in
inventory there are two possible causes: one is a lengthening of the inventory holding
period and the other is an increase in sales volume causing more inventory to be held.
The inventory holding period helps to narrow down the possible cause. If the trade
receivables increase there are two possible causes. One is that customers are taking
longer to pay and the other is that credit sales are increasing. The period of credit
given to customers helps to narrow down the cause here.
The amount of cash invested in capital expenditure is an important sign of the 
continuing development of the business. Ratios are used by analysts in comparing
capital expenditure to depreciation and comparing capital expenditure to the existing
asset base.

Part 4 Analysis and issues in reporting
426
Working note 5
There is an increase in trade receivables (debtors) seen by comparing the statements of
ﬁnancial position at the end of year 1 and year 2. This decreases the cash ﬂow.
Working note 6
There is an increase in trade payables (creditors) seen by comparing the statements of
ﬁnancial position at the end of year 1 and year 2. This has a positive effect on the cash
ﬂow by increasing the amount unpaid.
Working note 7
Interest paid is calculated from the income statement expense £15m plus the unpaid
interest at the start of the year £7m minus the unpaid interest at the end of the year,
£6m.
Working note 8
Taxes paid are calculated from the income statement charge £30m plus the unpaid liab-
ility at the start of the year £7m minus the unpaid liability at the end of the year £8m.
Working note 9
The purchase cost of non-current assets is given in the further information. It can be
checked by taking the cost at the start of the year £100m, adding £80m and deducting
the £30m cost of the disposal to leave £150m as shown in the statement of ﬁnancial
position at the end of the year.
Working note 10
The proceeds of sale £25m are given in the further information. This can be checked
by taking the net book value of the asset sold (£30m −£10m = £20m) and adding the
gain on disposal, the £5m shown in the income statement.
Working note 11
The interest received is taken from the income statement. There is no interest receivable
shown in the statement of ﬁnancial position so the income statement ﬁgure must be
the same as the cash ﬁgure.
Working note 12
The proceeds from the share issue are the total of the increase in share capital £10m
plus the increase in share premium £2m.
Working note 13
The proceeds from long-term borrowings are the increase in long-term loans calculated
by comparing the opening and closing statements of ﬁnancial position.
Working note 14
The dividend paid is given in the further information. It can be checked by taking the
retained earnings at the start of the period, £6m, add the proﬁt of the period, £60m, and
deduct dividend £14m to arrive at the retained earnings at the end of the period, £52m.
Working note 15
The cash and cash equivalents at the start and end of the period are taken from the 
statement of ﬁnancial position.

Chapter 15 Reporting cash flows
427
In practice the cash receipts from customers and cash payments to suppliers 
and employees are taken from the records of cash received and paid, which requires
analysis of the cash records. In this relatively straightforward situation the ﬁgures may
be conﬁrmed from the information in the statement of ﬁnancial position and income
statement.
Working note 1
The cash receipts from customers may be conﬁrmed from revenue £246m, plus receiv-
ables at the start of the period £16m, minus receivables at the end of the period £18m,
equals £244m.
Working note 2
There are two stages to the conﬁrmation of cash paid to suppliers. First the purchases are
calculated from cost of sales £110m plus inventory at the end £20m minus inventory
at the start £15m = £115m. Next the payment to suppliers is conﬁrmed from purchases:
£115m plus liability at the start £13m minus liability at the end £14m equals £114m. 
It is assumed that the wages are all paid when the work is done so there is no accrual.
Working note 3
The administrative and selling expenses are seen in the income statement. There is no
accrual indicated in the statement of ﬁnancial position and so the cash ﬁgure equals
the expense ﬁgure.

questions to help you review your reading are in the ‘A’ series of questions. You will find the
answers to these by reading and thinking about the material in the book. ‘Application’ questions
to test your ability to apply technical skills are in the ‘B’ series of questions. Questions requiring
you to show skills in problem solving and evaluation are in the ‘C’ series of questions. A letter
[S] indicates that there is a solution at the end of the book.
15.7.3
Comment on statement of cash flows
The cash ﬂow from operating activities amounted to £75m. The purchase of non-current
(ﬁxed) assets cost £80m but this was offset by £25m proceeds of sale of non-current
assets no longer required and was also helped by the £4m interest received from
investments. The net outﬂow from investments was £51m. This left £24m of cash ﬂow
available to increase cash resources but £14m was required for dividend payments.
The remaining £10m was added to the proceeds of a share issue, £12m and an increase
in long-term loans, £5m, giving an overall cash inﬂow of £27m.
15.8 Summary
l The statement of cash ﬂows provides information about changes in ﬁnancial pos-
ition that adds to the understanding of the business obtainable from the statement
of ﬁnancial position and income statement (proﬁt and loss account).
l It explains changes in cash and cash equivalents arising from operating activities,
investing activities and ﬁnancing activities.
l Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.
l Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily con-
vertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of
changes in value.
l The indirect method and the direct method are alternative approaches to calculating
the cash ﬂow arising from operating activities.
l The indirect method starts with the proﬁt from operations, eliminates non-cash
expenses such as depreciation, and adds on or deducts the effects of changes in
working capital to arrive at the cash ﬂow arising from operating activities.
l The direct method takes each item of operating cash ﬂow separately from the cash
records to arrive at the cash ﬂow arising from operating activities.
l The cash ﬂow is useful in analysis when combined with ratio analysis that shows
relationships of liquidity, working capital management, rates of investment in non-
current assets and ﬁnancial gearing.

REAL WORLD CASE
This case study describes the role of the management
accountant. Read it now, but only attempt the discussion
points after you have finished studying the chapter.
What is management accounting?
The following extracts are taken from the website of the
Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. The
leading global professional body of Management
Accountants.
CIMA is the world’s largest professional body of
management accountants. We offer the most relevant
finance qualification for business. Management
accountants interpret financial information to make
business decisions. Top CFOs, CEOs and management
consultants are chartered management accountants. CIMA
has equipped business pioneers with the skills to achieve
exceptional things – for their employers, and as individuals.
Member profiles
CIMA member Simon H spearheaded an initiative to
implement a single system to enable a major oil exploration company to define strategies for asset
groups and report clearly on risk profiles and likely returns.
In a scientific instrument company, CIMA member Michael T’s war on waste saw percentage of
products delivered in three weeks rise to 70% (from 57%) and inventory costs down by a third
($44million).
In a global conglomerate company my team and I are putting information in front of decision makers
every day to really guide this business to go forward. We grow very quickly. Our competitors grow
very quickly. Our customers’ needs change. So every day we have to take a new look at ourselves
and a new look at the market situation. Management accounting does that for you.

Activity 16.1
Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
438
16.1 Introduction
In Financial accounting, section 1.1, we deﬁned accounting:
Definition
Accounting is the process of identifying, measuring and communicating financial
information about an entity to permit informed judgements and decisions by users of 
the information.1
The process of identifying, measuring and communicating ﬁnancial information
has been explained and illustrated in Parts 1 to 5, Financial accounting, by reference 
to communicating with users external to the entity. However, many would argue that
the foremost users of accounting information about an organisation must be those
who manage it on a day-to-day basis. This group is referred to in broad terms as 
management, which is a collective term for all those persons who have responsibilities
for making judgements and decisions within an organisation. Because they have close
involvement with the business, they have access to a wide range of information (much
of which may be conﬁdential within the organisation) and will seek those aspects of
the information which are most relevant to their particular judgements and decisions.
Because this group of users is so broad, and because of the vast amount of information
potentially available, a specialist branch of accounting has developed, called manage-
ment accounting, to serve the particular needs of management.
Imagine that you are in charge of a cycle hire business in a holiday resort. You have 
50 cycles available for hire. Some customers hire cycles for one day; others take them 
for up to one week. Write down any three decisions that you might make as a manager,
where accounting information would be helpful in making the decision.
16.1.1
Applying the definition
Consider the following three scenarios which are typical of comments in the ‘man-
agement’ section of the ﬁnancial press. As you read each scenario, think about how it
relates to the deﬁnition of ‘accounting’ given at the start of this section. Then read the
comment following the scenario and compare it with your thinking.
Scenario 16.1
‘In the 12 months to June 30, net profits dropped from £280m to £42m, depressed by hefty
investments, increased paper costs and poor advertising spending . . . The chief executive
has explained the company’s plans for improving its margins to the average level for the
industry. The directors are also committed to getting the assets to work creatively
together.’ (Report on a magazine publishing company)
Scenario 16.1 indicates decision making related to profit margins and the effective
use of assets. The proﬁt margins will be improved either by improving sales, or by
controlling costs, or through a mixture of both. Assets will be used more effectively
if they create more proﬁt or higher sales. Achieving these targets requires a range of
managerial skills covering sales, production and asset management. Identifying the
relevant costs and revenues, measuring the achievement of targets and communicat-
ing the outcomes within the organisation are all functions of management accounting.
The chief executive will need to form a judgement on whether the decisions taken are
likely to satisfy investors and maintain their conﬁdence in the management team.

Chapter 16 Functions of management accounting
439
Scenario 16.2
Salespersons at a car manufacturer’s dealership noticed business was slow in April. They
reacted by encouraging customers to take more time in deciding whether to buy a car.
What was the reason? They were paid a monthly bonus where sales exceeded a specified
target. They could see that the April sales would not reach the target and so encouraged
customers to wait until May, to increase the likely volume of May sales. In a brewing company
the sales manager set a low sales target, in the hope of exceeding it easily. This caused 
the company to reduce production, so that when demand for beer rose to a higher level
because of good weather, the company could not provide adequate supplies. (Journalist’s
comment on how unrealistic targets can distort achievement of company objectives.)
Scenario 16.2 shows that at some point in the past a decision was taken to create
employee incentives by setting quantiﬁable targets. Unfortunately this has led to a
narrow focus on measuring the achievement of the targets. There was a problem in
allowing the employees too much freedom to inﬂuence either the setting of the target
or the achievement of the target, and no judgement about the best interests of the com-
pany. A further decision is now required to balance the motivation of the employees
against the best interests of the company. Communication is an important feature of
getting the decision right.
Scenario 16.3
‘Engineers are challenging the assumption that companies are run by number-crunchers
. . . The hidden skill of engineers is their ability to be analytical and numerate. As someone
who has to evaluate and sit on the boards of information technology and software develop-
ment companies, I have the ability to understand the basics of their business.’ (Managing
director of a venture capital company, qualified engineer.)
The term ‘number-cruncher’ tends to be used as a somewhat uncomplimentary
description of an accounting specialist. The engineer quoted in Scenario 16.3 has
related to the measurement aspect of accounting and has identiﬁed the need to make
judgements (‘evaluate’) using analytical skills. However, this quotation has made 
no mention either of communication or of decision making. There is an increasing
expectation that the management accountants in an organisation will work with the
engineers or other technical specialists, that they will try to understand the nature of
the business and will ensure that the judgements are communicated to the experts so
that cost-effective decisions can be made.
16.1.2
Matching the approach to the judgements or decisions
Management accounting methods have developed in a variety of ways depending on
the judgements or decisions required. This is sometimes described in terms of a con-
tingency theory of management accounting. The management accounting approach is
conditioned by (is contingent upon) the situation. Management accounting methods
have been developed within particular industries. In the UK economy approximately
75% of output is provided by service industry with only 25% of output being provided
by manufacturing industry. However, management accounting began to develop in the
twentieth century at a time when manufacturing industry dominated. As the service
sector has grown, management accounting has developed to meet its particular 
needs. What remains of the manufacturing sector has moved from being labour inten-
sive to being capital intensive. In some parts of the world, manufacturing remains
labour intensive. The agricultural sector may be stronger. All these differences lead to
different judgements and decisions, and hence different approaches to identifying,

Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
440
measuring and communicating accounting data. The following chapters will explain
management accounting techniques that have been developed to meet particular
needs in making judgements and decisions.
16.1.3
Strategic management accounting
The traditional approach to management accounting has been to regard internal 
decision makers as inward looking. This has led to developing techniques for identify-
ing, measuring and communicating costs where only internal comparisons have been
thought relevant. Those techniques remain useful in some cases and are sufﬁciently
widely used to justify studying them in an introductory course. However, the later years
of the twentieth century brought an increasing awareness that company managers
must be outward looking. They must form a strategy for their business that has regard
to what competitors are achieving. This requires management accounting to identify,
measure and communicate data on the company relative to data for other similar com-
panies. Managers must consider competitive forces such as the threat of new entrants,
substitute products or services, rivalry within the industry and the relative bargaining
strength of suppliers and customers. Managers must also consider how their organ-
isation adds value in creating its product. There is a ﬂow of business activity from
research and development through production, marketing, distribution and after-
sales support. This chain of activities creates costs which must be compared with the
value added by the organisation. The term strategic management accounting applies
to the identiﬁcation, measurement and communication of cost data in all these situ-
ations where the organisation is being judged against the performance of competitors.
16.2 Meeting the needs of internal users
Although the deﬁnition of accounting remains appropriate for internal reporting pur-
poses, its application will be different because internal users need to form judgements
and make decisions that are different from those of external users. External users form
judgements on the overall performance of the entity and make decisions about their
relationship with it. Their decisions are of the type: ‘Shall I invest money in this busi-
ness?’, ‘Shall I continue to be an investor in this business?’, ‘Shall I supply goods to 
this business?’, ‘Shall I continue to supply goods to this business?’, ‘Shall I become a
customer of this business?’, ‘Shall I continue to be a customer of this business?’
The internal users make different types of judgements and different types of 
decisions. They may have to judge the performance of the various products of the
organisation as compared with those of competitors. They may have to judge the per-
formance of different divisions within the organisation. Their decisions are of the 
type: ‘Shall I invest in manufacturing more soap powder, or do I switch resources into
toothpaste?’, ‘Shall I continue offering a television repair service as support for my
sales of televisions?’, ‘Is it cost-effective to have three separate locations at which my
tenants can pay their rent?’, ‘Will this investment in a new factory pay for itself over
the next ten years?’ There is great variety in the judgements and decisions made by
those who manage the business. Their needs are so wide ranging that management
accounting has developed as a separate discipline, within the overall ‘accounting’
umbrella, in order to serve the particular needs of management.
The use of accounting as a tool which will assist in the management of a business
raises two signiﬁcant questions:
1 What types of informed judgements are made by management and about 
management?
2 What types of decisions are made by management?

Chapter 16 Functions of management accounting
441
It is presumed that many of those reading this text for the ﬁrst time may not have
a great deal of experience of the types of judgements and decisions made in business.
This chapter therefore devotes space to four case study illustrations of management
situations where management accounting will have a contribution to make. The case
studies are uncomplicated so that the management accounting applications are in-
tuitively obvious. After each case study outline there is a comment on the management
accounting aspects. You will then meet Fiona McTaggart, a management accounting
consultant, who explains how she sees the management accountant’s contribution to
the management issues raised in each of the four case studies.
Before exploring the case studies, this chapter sets out, in section 16.3, some basic
categories of management functions and then outlines, in section 16.4, the role of man-
agement accounting in helping to meet the information needs of those management
functions.
16.3 Management functions
This section describes three management functions: planning, decision making and
control.
To be effective, each of these functions requires the application by management of
communication and motivation skills. To ensure that the entity’s operations are effective,
those who work in the entity must be persuaded to identify with its objectives. Managers
require the skills to motivate those for whom they are responsible, creating a sense of
teamwork. The communication process is a vital part of creating a sense of teamwork
and ensuring that all the players understand the role they play in achieving targets.
They must also be motivated to want to achieve the targets. Management accounting
has a particularly important role in that process of communication and motivation.
16.3.1
Planning
Planning is a very general term which covers longer-term strategic planning and
shorter-term operational planning. These two types of planning differ in the timescale
that they cover. Strategic planning involves preparing, evaluating and selecting strat-
egies to achieve objectives of a long-term plan of action. Operational planning relates 
to the detailed plans by which those working within an organisation are expected to
meet the short-term objectives of their working group.
Strategic planning is based on objectives set by those who manage the entity at a senior
level. If the entity is a legal entity such as a limited liability company or a public 
sector corporation, objectives will be set for the corporate entity which will require
high-level corporate strategic planning. Within the company or corporation there will
be major divisions of activities into key business areas, each with their own objectives
requiring business strategic planning.
The corporate entity may contain many different businesses and those who manage
the corporate entity as a whole must manage the entire collection of businesses. They
must decide which businesses to develop in the corporate interest, which to support when
in temporary difﬁculties, and which to dispose of as no longer contributing to the corpor-
ate well-being. Business strategic planning focuses on each of the separate businesses
which have to consider not only their position within the corporate group of businesses
but also their position within the industry or sector to which the business belongs.
Shorter-term operational planning is also referred to as functional strategic plan-
ning. It concentrates on the actions of speciﬁc functions within the business. Although
these functions may have a longer-term existence they must also plan their activity in
shorter-term periods so that achievement of targets may be monitored regularly.

Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
442
At a practical level, managers ﬁnd that they have to plan ahead in making major
decisions on such things as sales, production and capital expenditure. Such planning
is required for the immediate future and for the longer term. Businesses will typically
make a detailed plan for the year ahead and a broader plan for a two- to ﬁve-year
period. Plans for sales require decisions on which products to sell, which markets to
target and what price to charge. Plans for production require decisions on the mix 
of resources, including labour, the source of raw materials or component parts, the
level of stock of raw materials and ﬁnished goods to hold and the most effective use
of productive capacity. Plans for capital expenditure require a longer-term perspec-
tive, taking into account the expected life of the capital equipment acquired. As well
as investing in fixed assets, the business will need working capital as a base for a new
project. Decisions will be required on the level of working capital which is appro-
priate. If the enterprise is to move ahead, plans must lead to decisions.
16.3.2
Decision making
Decision making is central to the management of an enterprise. The manager of a proﬁt-
making business has to decide on the manner of implementation of the objectives 
of the business, at least one of which may well relate to allocating resources so as 
to maximise proﬁt. A non-proﬁt-making enterprise (such as a department of central 
or local government) will be making decisions on resource allocation so as to be 
economic, efﬁcient and effective in its use of ﬁnance. All organisations, whether in the
private sector or the public sector, take decisions which have ﬁnancial implications.
Decisions will be about resources, which may be people, products, services or long-
term and short-term investment. Decisions will also be about activities, including
whether and how to undertake them. Most decisions will at some stage involve con-
sideration of ﬁnancial matters, particularly cost. Decisions may also have an impact on
the working conditions and employment prospects of employees of the organisation,
so that cost considerations may, in making a ﬁnal decision, be weighed against social
issues. Where the owners are different persons from the manager (e.g. shareholders 
of a company as separate persons from the directors), the managers may face a de-
cision where there is a potential conﬂict between their own interests and those of the
owners. In such a situation cost considerations may be evaluated in the wider context
of the responsibility of the managers to act in the best interests of the owners.
16.3.3
Control
Once a decision has been taken on any aspect of business activity, management must
be in a position to control the activity and to have a view on whether the outcome is
in accordance with the initial plans and with the objectives derived from those plans.
This might involve identifying areas in the business where managers are in a position
to control and account for costs and, in some cases, proﬁt. To implement the control pro-
cess, individual managers will require timely, relevant and accurate information about
the part of the business for which they are responsible. Measurement, including cost
measurement, is therefore an important ingredient in carrying out the control function.
To carry out the control function, a management control system is needed. A useful
deﬁnition of a management control system is the following:
Definition
A management control system is a system involving organisational information-seeking
and gathering, accountability and feedback designed to ensure that the enterprise adapts
to changes in its substantive environment and that the work behaviour of its employees 
is measured by reference to a set of operational sub-goals (which conform with overall
objectives) so that the discrepancy between the two can be reconciled and corrected for.2

Activity 16.2
Chapter 16 Functions of management accounting
443
This deﬁnition points to some of the aspects of control which will be encountered
in later chapters. It acknowledges the process of seeking and gathering information
but emphasises the importance of adaptation and meeting operational goals. Later
chapters will refer to feedback processes and also to techniques for measuring differ-
ences between actual performance and sub-goals set for that performance.
The information provided to individual management is an essential part of the
communication process within a business. For effective communication, there must be
an organisational structure which reﬂects the responsibility and authority of manage-
ment. Communication must cascade down through this organisational structure and
the manner of communication must have regard for the motivation of those who are
part of the control process. For control to be effective there must also be a reverse form
of communication upwards so that management learn of the concerns of their staff.
Motivation, expectations and personal relationships are all matters to be considered
and to be harnessed effectively by the process of control.
Think of an organised activity in which you participate at college or at home. To what
extent does this activity involve planning, decision making and control? Who carries 
out the planning? Who makes the decision? Who exercises control?
16.3.4
An organisation chart
Figure 16.1 presents a simple organisation chart showing various types of relation-
ships in a manufacturing company. It illustrates line relationships within the overall
ﬁnance function of the business, showing separately the management accounting and
ﬁnancial accounting functions. In most medium to large companies, the management
accounting function will be a separate area of activity within the ﬁnance function. The
term ‘management accountant’ is used here as a general term, but a brief perusal of
the ‘situations vacant’ pages of any newspaper or professional magazine advertising
accountancy posts would indicate the range of titles available and the versatility
expected (see Case 16.1 at the end of the chapter). Two other functions have been
shown in the chart as ‘project accountant’ and ‘systems accountant’. Such specialists
have speciﬁc roles in the internal accounting process within the enterprise which are
relevant, although not exclusive, to the management accounting function.
The organisation chart shows individual people, each with a different job to do.
Each person has a specialisation indicated by the job title, but he or she also has
responsibilities to others higher in the structure and with authority over others lower
in the structure. In the interests of the business as a whole, individuals must communi-
cate up and down the line relationships and also across the horizontal relationships.
Taking one line relationship as an example, the ﬁnance director must make plans
for the year ahead which are communicated to the ﬁnancial controller. The ﬁnancial
controller must consult the systems accountant to ensure that the accounting systems
are in place to record and communicate these plans within the organisation. The 
ﬁnancial controller must also consult the project accountant to ensure that there is 
an evaluation of any capital investment aspects of the ﬁnance director’s plans. The 
management accountant will prepare accounting statements showing how the plans
will be implemented. The ﬁnancial controller will bring together the details supplied
by each person, summarising and evaluating the main factors so that the results may
be relayed to the ﬁnance director.
Horizontal relationships can be more difﬁcult when communications channels are
being planned, because there are so many potential combinations. It is a responsibility
of management to decide which horizontal relationships have the greatest com-
munication needs. Continuing the planning theme, the ﬁnance director will be expected

Activity 16.3
Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
444
to communicate the ﬁnancial plan to the other members of the board of directors, who
in turn will want to see that it ﬁts the board’s overall strategy and that it is compatible
with the capacity of their particular areas of activity in the business. The ﬁnancial 
plan will depend on the projected level of sales and will reﬂect strategy in production
and personnel management. The plan will therefore need to be communicated to the
sales co-ordinator, the production supervisor and the personnel manager. The sales
co-ordinator, production supervisor and personnel manager will in turn provide feed-
back to the ﬁnancial controller. The detailed analysis of the plans for the period, and
the expected impact of those plans, will be evaluated by the management accountant,
project accountant and systems accountant. They will report back to the ﬁnancial con-
troller who in turn will channel information to the ﬁnance director and the rest of the
board of directors.
Think again about the organised activity which you identified in Activity 16.2. Prepare an
organisation chart to include all the persons involved in the activity. Draw green lines with
arrows to show the direction of communication. Draw red lines with arrows to show the
direction of responsibility. What does the pattern of red and green lines tell you about
communication and co-ordination in the organisation? What is the mechanism for
motivation? Does it use the communication network?

16.3.5
Illustration of the interrelationships
The three management functions of planning, decision making and control are all
interrelated in the overall purpose of making judgements and decisions. Figure 16.2
shows how a company owning a chain of shops supplying motorcycle spares might
go about the business of planning to open a new shop in the suburbs of a city. The
shop will sell motorcycle spares and will also provide advice on basic repair work
which motor cyclists can safely undertake themselves.
The shop’s objectives will be concerned with achieving target sales and proﬁt, and with
making an adequate return on the capital invested in establishing the shop. Because of
the desire to offer an advice service as well as selling spare parts, there will be non-
ﬁnancial objectives expressed in terms of customer satisfaction. These non-ﬁnancial
objectives will have indirect ﬁnancial implications because satisﬁed customers will
lead to increased sales and increased proﬁts. The location of the shop, other types of
shop close by, hours and days of opening and approach to stock control are all factors
which are considered in the planning process. The choice of shop premises will
depend upon the rent to be paid, any costs associated with the property, such as 
refurbishment and repairs, access for delivery and collection and security. If the 
shop is to trade successfully there will need to be parking facilities, good access by
road and preferably public transport back-up for those who need spare parts but
whose motorcycles are too much in need of repair to be used as transport to the shop.
Location requires careful consideration. Is it preferable to have the shop in a neigh-
bourhood where a high proportion of residents own motorcycles or to locate it on a
main road along which they travel to work? Evaluation for decision-making purposes
will require information about planned costs and revenues, although non-cost factors
may also inﬂuence the decision.
Knowing the objectives and planning to meet those objectives will result in a de-
cision, but the decision to start up the shop is not the end of the story. There has to be a
Figure 16.2

Activity 16.4

continuing judgement as to whether the shop is successful and, eventually, there may
be another decision on expanding or contracting the shop’s activity. The continuing
exercise of judgement will require a management accounting information outcome of
the judgement. Any future decision to expand or contract will similarly include a
requirement for information on planned costs and revenues.
Planning, decision making and control are shown on the diagram in Figure 16.2 as
separate parts of the total activity. Communication is shown by arrows from one stage
to the next. Motivation is not easily shown on a diagram, so there is no attempt to do
so, but it remains an important part of the communication process. The greater the
number of communication trails built into the process, the more effective will be 
the understanding and motivation of those who carry out the work of the business 
at various levels of management. Ideally, the diagram would be criss-crossed with
communication trails so that all participants are well informed.
Imagine that you want to set up a business as a travel agent booking low-cost holidays
with the emphasis on good value. List two activities that you might carry out in each of
the stages of planning, decision making and control.
16.4 Role of management accounting
In the previous illustration of planning where to open a new shop, there is work for
the management accountant: ﬁrst, in directing attention to accounting information
which is relevant to making plans and taking the decision; second, in keeping the
score for making judgements on the effectiveness of decisions; and third, in helping to
solve problems which arise when the results of decision making do not work out 
as expected. So there are three roles that management accounting could play in this
exercise that will be found to be general features of any decision-making situation
encountered by management. These are: directing attention, keeping the score and
solving problems.
16.4.1
Directing attention
Directing attention is a matter of being able to answer questions such as ‘Who should
take action?’ or ‘Whose responsibility is this loss?’ or ‘Who is to be congratulated on
this favourable result?’ Managers are busy people. They do not always have time to
consider every detail of cost information about the operation or process they control.
They look to the management accountant to direct their attention to the exceptional
points of interest, be these good or bad. One way of carrying out that function is to
highlight those costs which have departed from expectations – provided everyone
understands at the outset what the expectations are. Words such as fairness and time-
liness are almost bound to be involved in attention-directing processes.
Managers are also sensitive people. They do not like being blamed unjustly for
something they see as being beyond their control. So the management accounting
information has to be presented in such a way as to relate to the level of responsibility
and degree of authority held by the manager concerned. On the other side of the coin,
managers enjoy being praised for achievements and may welcome management
accounting information which helps them to demonstrate their accountability for the
resources entrusted to them.
In any organisation emphasising strategic management, it will be part of the role of
management accounting to direct the attention of management towards information

Chapter 16 Functions of management accounting
447
about competitors. Competitive forces include: the threat posed by new entrants to 
the industry, the emergence of substitute products or services, the relative strength of
suppliers and customers in controlling prices and conditions in the industry and the
intensity of rivalry within the industry. Such information is often well known on an
anecdotal basis. The management accountant may be required to collect and present
information in a useful and focused manner.
The role of management accounting in directing attention will therefore depend 
on how managers wish their attention to be directed. A business which retains an
inward-looking approach to management will expect management accounting to
direct attention inwards. A business which is thinking strategically about its position
in the market for goods and services will expect management accounting to include an
outward-looking perspective.
Strategic management accounting has been deﬁned as:
Definition
The provision and analysis of financial information on the firm’s product markets and
competitors’ costs and cost structures and the monitoring of the enterprise’s strategies
and those of its competitors in these markets over a number of periods.3
The practical effects of the different types of management accounting approaches
are summarised in Table 16.1.
16.4.2
Keeping the score
Keeping the score is very much a case of being able to answer the questions ‘How
much?’ or ‘How many?’ at any point in time. It requires careful record keeping and a
Table 16.1
Contrasting an inward and outward focus of management
Possible limitations of an inward focus 
for management
A risk of placing too much emphasis 
on evaluating past actions.
A risk of focusing on the business 
entity alone.
A tendency to focus on a single 
reporting period.
Directing attention towards separate 
single issues of decision making.
Directing attention to the outcome of 
the manufacturing or service activity 
of the particular organisation.
A tendency to concentrate on existing 
activities.
Risk of not considering linkages within 
the organisation or potential for 
effective linkages beyond.
Benefits of an outward focus for
management
Management accounting includes a
prospective element evaluating the
potential outcomes of various strategies.
Management accounting sets information
about the business entity in the context 
of other businesses in the sector.
Management accounting sets the results
of one period in a longer-term analysis.
Management accounting directs attention
towards sequences and patterns in
decision making.
Management accounting directs attention
to the competition for the manufacturing
or service activity.
Management accounting is also expected
to look to prospective activities.
Management accounting is expected to
direct attention to effective linkages which
will improve competitive position.

Activity 16.5
Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting

constant monitoring of accounting records against physical quantities and measures
of work done. The emphasis is on completeness but also on fairness. Questions such as
‘How much?’ may involve sharing, or allocating, costs. Accounting is concerned with
allocations of various types, all concerned with aspects of matching. That could require
matching costs to a time period, matching costs to an item of output, or matching costs
against revenue for the period. For this matching process to be effective, information
must be complete and the basis of allocation must be fair.
For the business which has a strong emphasis on strategic management, score keep-
ing will include being able to answer questions such as ‘How much of the market
share?’ or ‘How many compared to our competitors?’ Questions of fairness of allo-
cation within the business may be important but it may be even more important to
understand the performance of the business in relation to others. Such questions will
be answered by both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial measures.
16.4.3
Solving problems
Solving problems involves a different type of question. It might be ‘Why did that 
plan go well?’ or ‘Why did that action fail?’ or ‘Which of these three choices is the 
best to take?’ In solving problems of this type, relevance is an important issue. People
who have taken a decision are often reluctant to admit that it has not turned out 
as expected and may continue making worse mistakes unless someone points out 
that past events are of little or no relevance to decisions on future action. Where
choices are concerned, those choices will involve people, each of whom may have 
different motives for preferring one choice above others. Management accounting
information may have a role in providing an objective base for understanding the
problem to be solved, even where at the end of the day a decision is based on non-
accounting factors.
Some problems resemble making a jigsaw, or perhaps deciding which piece of 
the jigsaw has gone missing. Other problems are like solving crosswords where the
answers must interlock but some of the clues have been obliterated. In solving any
problem of that type, logical reasoning is essential. No one can memorise the answer
to every conceivable question which might arise. You will ﬁnd that management
accounting tests your powers of logical reasoning in that every problem you encounter
will never entirely resemble the previous one.
Figure 16.3 illustrates a combination of the management accounting functions 
of directing attention, keeping the score and solving problems. It shows the cycle of
proﬁt planning and control, starting with the measurement of existing performance,
which is an example of the score-keeping aspects of management accounting. From
the measurement of existing performance the cycle moves through an examination 
of the future environment of the business, where techniques of economic analysis
would be used. In developing objectives, the management accountant would provide
accounting information on targets to be achieved. Formulating a strategy is a manage-
ment task but the management accountant is then expected to provide detailed budgets
which translate that strategy into operating plans. When the plans are implemented
the management accountant must be ready to measure the results and compare these
with the outcome expected when the operating plans were set. From there the cycle 
is repeated.
Look back to your list from Activity 1.4 for planning, decision making and control in
setting up a travel agency business. Make another list of ways in which management
accounting will help in directing attention, keeping the score and solving problems.

16.5 Judgements and decisions: case study illustrations
You are now presented with four cases in which there is a need for decisions and for
judgements. After each case study there is a brief analysis of the decisions and judge-
ments which will arise in each.
These four cases indicate areas where management accounting could serve as a tool
to provide information which is relevant to decision making and to the formation of
judgement at all levels within an organisation. Hopefully, you will have recognised
some situations in each case where accounting information will be of help.
The organisation chart in Figure 16.1 includes an expert management accountant. 
It has already been explained that most medium to large companies include specialist
management accountants on their staff. However, from time to time a consultant may
be called in to give a wider and more frank appraisal than might be feasible for a paid
employee. In this and subsequent chapters you will meet Fiona McTaggart, a freelance
management accountant, who is prepared to offer advice on a variety of case study 
situations. In practice, the management accountant within the organisation might 
provide similar advice, but this text uses the management consultant so that her 
comments are not unduly constrained by existing limitations within the business.
Fiona explains what she could offer from her management accounting experience
in each of these four case study situations. Read her explanations and in each case
identify the places where she is hinting at directing attention, keeping the score or
solving problems.
Read the text of the case study (set out in the box at the beginning of each case) and
then make a note of the way in which you think management accounting may help each
person. Compare your answer with the discussion which follows each case.

16.5.1
Case study: Jon Okike
Jonh Okike has taken early retirement at the age of 50 in order to develop his hobby of
model shipbuilding into a full-time business. He has several models already assembled and
has advertised in the model builders’ weekly journal. Interested enquiries are starting to
come in and he realises that he does not know what price to charge for the models.
Analysis of decisions and judgements
Jon Okike needs to make a decision about pricing policy. That will involve many 
factors such as looking at what competitors are charging, having regard to the type 
of customer he expects to attract, and making sure that the price covers the cost of
making and selling the models. After he has decided on a pricing policy he will need
to measure its success by making judgements on the level of sales achieved and on the
profitability of the product in relation to the capital he has invested in the business.
FIONA: Jon Okike needs to know the cost of the models he is making. That sounds easy –
he has a note of the money he has spent on materials for the models and he has detailed
plans which tell him exactly how much material is used for each one. But that’s not the end
of the story. Jon puts a tremendous amount of time into the model building. He says it is
all enjoyment to him, so he doesn’t treat that time as a cost, but I have to persuade him
that making the models represents a lost opportunity to do something else. The cost of his
time could be measured in terms of that lost opportunity.
Then there are his tools. He has a workshop at the end of the garage and it’s stacked
high with tools. They don’t last for ever and the cost of depreciation should be spread over
the models produced using those tools. He needs heat to keep the workshop warm, power
for the electric tools and packing material for the models sent in response to a postal
enquiry. He has paid for an advertisement in the model builders’ magazine and there is 
stationery, as well as postage and telephone calls, to consider.
Costs never seem to end once you start to add them up. It can all be a bit depressing,
but it is much more depressing to sell something and then find out later that you’ve made
a loss. I could help Jon work out his costs and make sure the price he charges will leave a
profit so that he builds up his investment in the business.
Making the decision on selling price would not be the end of my involvement. I would
continue to measure costs each month and compare these with sales. I would give Jon
reports on profit and cash flow and warnings if working capital was starting to build up. If
he gives credit he’ll need to keep an eye on the level of debtors, and there will always be
a stock, either of raw materials or of finished goods or of both. Trade creditors will fund
some of the stock but working capital mismanagement has been the downfall of many a
business which tried to expand too fast.
I will also need to keep Jon down to earth in ensuring that what has until now been 
a hobby can become a successful business. I will direct his attention to professional 
business reports for this kind of specialist service. I will encourage him to subscribe to
information services and I will incorporate such information in my reports to Jon so that he
can take a realistic view of his performance compared with what might be expected in the
general business of special craft work.
In advising Jon Okike, Fiona McTaggart will direct attention to the costs which are
relevant to the pricing decision, she will keep the score by calculating proﬁts once the
business is in production and will help solve problems by monitoring the working
capital position.

16.5.2
Case study: Sara Lee
Sara Lee has been operating a small hairdressing business for several months. She would
like to expand by employing an assistant and by purchasing new dryers and washing
equipment. She cannot decide whether the investment would be justified.
Analysis of decisions and judgements
Sara Lee will be taking a longer-term view in making a decision about investing in
new equipment. That equipment must generate cash ﬂows over its expected life.
Sara’s decision to invest will take into account the number of customers she expects,
the prices she is able to charge them, and the cost of paying the proposed assistant,
projected ahead for several years. It will also take into account the percentage return
expected on the capital invested in the equipment.
If she decides to invest, she will need to monitor the success of that investment by
making judgements on the proﬁtability of the product in relation to the capital she has
invested in it, and on whether the return on the investment is adequate in the light of
having expanded the business.
FIONA: Sara Lee needs help in taking a longer-term perspective. To assess the profit-
ability of the new equipment and the assistant, I’ll first of all need Sara to tell me how 
many customers she can realistically expect and what she will be able to charge them. 
I’ll need those estimates over the life of the equipment, which will probably be around 
five years.
Once I have the estimates of cash inflows from customers over the five years, I can 
set against that the cash outflows in terms of payments for all the costs of providing 
the service, including the wages of the intended assistant. Then I will apply to those cash
flows a factor which makes an allowance for uncertainty in the future and also takes
account of the rate of interest Sara could earn if she invested her money in financial 
markets rather than hairdryers. I’ll then compare the expected cash flows with the initial
cost of acquiring the equipment, to see whether it’s a good idea. Of course, if Sara gets
the cash flow estimates wrong, then the answer won’t mean very much, but that’s not 
my problem.
If Sara makes the decision to invest, I’ll be needed after that to monitor the success of
the project. I can measure the cash flows after the event and give an indication of how well
they met expectations. I can compare the cost of the assistant with the revenue generated
by the extra work available.
Problems might arise if there is a change of fashion and everyone decides they prefer
short straight hair. That could cause chaos in the hairdressing industry and might make
some of the washing equipment surplus to requirements. There is a great temptation in
such situations to hang on to the past because of the cash which was sunk into it. That’s
often the wrong thing to do because it brings disaster ever closer. It may be better to cut
off the activity altogether and limit the losses. I can give a dispassionate view based on cost
rather than sentiment and emotion.
Fiona McTaggart will provide information which is relevant to the investment de-
cision by drawing attention to the cost in comparison with the expected cash inﬂows.
She will keep the score on the cash inﬂows and outﬂows once the project is established
and she will help in problem solving by evaluating the losses arising if an unsuccessful
project continues in operation.

16.5.3
Case study: Central Ltd
Central Ltd is a small business manufacturing and assembling plastic components for use
in car manufacture. It has been drawn to the attention of the ﬁnancial controller that one 
of the plastic components could be purchased elsewhere at a price less than the cost of 
manufacture. What action should the production director take?
Analysis of decisions and judgements
The production director of Central Ltd needs to decide whether to continue manu-
facturing the component within the business or to cease production and buy the 
component elsewhere. To make that decision requires a knowledge of the full cost 
of manufacture and reassurance that the cost has been calculated correctly. It also
depends on the relative aims and objectives of the ﬁnancial controller and the prod-
uction director, who may be in conﬂict and who may be putting their own point of
view at the expense of the overall good of the business. Costs of ceasing manufacture
will also need to be taken into account. Beyond the accounting costs there are human
costs and business risks. Is there alternative employment for the staff released from
this internal production? Will there be redundancy costs? Is it safe to rely on this 
outside supplier? What are the risks to Central Ltd if supplies dry up?
Whatever decision is taken, there will be a subsequent need for judgement in 
monitoring the effectiveness of the decision and its impact on proﬁtability. In the 
decision and in the subsequent judgements of the effectiveness of that decision, there
will be a need for communication and interaction between the ﬁnancial controller and
the production director.
FIONA: Central Ltd is an example of the football game situation where sometimes the 
players in a team forget that they are on the same side. I saw a game last week when the
home team won on the away team’s own goals. The same thing could happen for Central.
When people have a defined role in an organisation they can be too closely involved in 
their own work to see the bigger picture. The financial controller sees the costs of manu-
facturing and assembling the parts and has identified a cost saving based on a simple
comparison. It’s hard for the production director to fight the logic of that argument but 
I can see he’s worried.
What I can do is turn his worries into cost arguments which should be considered along-
side the direct make-or-buy comparison. The costs may not be capable of such precise
calculation but I’ll give estimates of the risk to the business and the sensitivity of the situ-
ation. I’ll give particular attention to the quality issues and to the risk of disruption of 
supply. It’s more than likely that the financial controller and the production director will 
still not agree even when they have the information, so I’ll present my information in a 
way which the board of directors can relate to the overall objectives and strategy of the
company. Whatever decision is taken, I’ll establish a monthly reporting system, to be 
operated by the financial controller, which will give the earliest possible warning of whether
the decision remains in the best interests of the company.
That is the traditional management accounting role which I am happy to provide.
However, I will also indicate, in conversation with the financial controller and the produc-
tion director, that it would be important to discover first of all what their competitors are
doing about this problem. The competitors will not answer the question directly but poten-
tial suppliers of the components may be willing to indicate that there is a similar demand
emerging elsewhere. If the problem here is that production costs are too high in relation to
the rest of the industry then perhaps the board of directors has to focus on cost reduction
rather than external purchase. If the price is lower externally, someone somewhere has
apparently found a better approach to cost control.

Chapter 16 Functions of management accounting
453
Fiona McTaggart will provide information directly relevant to the make-or-buy
decision. She will help in problem solving by setting out the information in such a way
that others in the organisation can be satisﬁed that a decision will be in the best 
interests of the company as a whole. Finally, she will establish a score-keeping system
which continues to monitor the effectiveness of the decision taken.
16.5.4
Case study: Anita Khan
Anita Khan is a hospital manager having responsibility for ensuring that the cost of treat-
ment is recovered in full by invoicing the patient or the appropriate organisation which is
financing the patient care. Pricing policy is dictated at a more senior level.
Analysis of decisions and judgements
Anita Khan has no direct decision-making responsibility but the information she 
collates and the records she keeps, in relation to identifying costs and charging these
costs to patients, will be used in the decision-making process at a more senior level. 
It will also be used as a tool of judgement on the effectiveness of the hospital’s 
cost control and charging policy for the various treatments and services provided. 
In this case the criteria for the judgement may be rather different in that there may be
less emphasis on profitability and more on the quality of service in relation to the cost
of providing that service.
FIONA: Anita Khan doesn’t have direct decision-making responsibility. She is a smaller cog
in a large machine. However, the efficiency with which she carries out her job will have 
a direct impact on the performance of the hospital and will have an impact on future 
decision making at a more senior level. Charging out to patients the cost of their care is a
difficult matter and requires very careful record keeping. Patients who are ill don’t question
their treatment at the time, but when they are convalescing they have lots of time to look
through the bill, especially if the medical insurance company is asking questions. Some
patients may be paid for through the health service but at the end of the line there is a fund-
holder who wants to ensure that the funds are used to best advantage.
The cost of, say, major surgery can be the least difficult to work out because the time
in theatre will be known, the staff on duty will be listed and their salary costs can be appor-
tioned over the time taken. But when the patient is back on the ward recovering, there have
to be records kept of the type of nursing care, the specialist equipment and supplies, food
costs and the hotel-type services associated with providing a bed. Then there have to be
charges to cover the overhead costs of heating, maintaining and cleaning the buildings.
Anita Khan needs an effective recording system which is accurate in terms of care for
each patient but is not so cumbersome to apply that the nurses’ time is entirely taken up
with clerical recording. Many costs can be applied to patient care on a predetermined
charge-out rate based on previous experience. A computerised cost recording system,
with a carefully thought out coding system for each cost, is essential. Of the four cases I have
considered here, this will be the most time-consuming to set up, but it will give satisfac-
tion all round when it is working and seen to be fair to patients in terms of individual charge-
out costs as well as giving the hospital reassurance that all costs are being recovered.
The cost-recording system will provide information for the decision-making process 
in relation to future pricing policy and also for the more difficult decisions as to which 
specialised medical functions at the hospital are cost-effective and which functions do not
fully cover costs. There are bound to be problems within the hospital if decisions are
needed on expanding or cutting back. Everyone hates the accountant at those times, 
but at least I can design a system which provides an objective starting point even though
non-financial factors are eventually the determining factor.

Fiona McTaggart is describing here the score-keeping aspects of management
accounting. That score keeping will be used as information for the decision-making
process and may also have a problem-solving aspect if disputes arise where medical
decisions have a cost impact.

Comment
These case study discussions have given some insight into how the management
accountant has a role to play in contributing to the management of an organisation.
Three general themes have been explored, namely keeping the score, directing atten-
tion and solving problems. The case studies have shown that within each of these
three themes there are many different approaches to be taken, depending on the 
circumstances. By way of illustration of the scope of management accounting activity,
Fiona McTaggart has the following list of special studies she has undertaken, as an
adviser on management accounting, where problem-solving skills have been required:
l product cost comparisons
l evaluation of product proﬁtability
l alternative choices of resource usage
l asset management
l labour relations
l capital investment
l investigation on behalf of customer for contract pricing purposes
l directing attention to the activities of competitors.
All of these, and other problem situations, will be encountered in subsequent 
chapters. This chapter ends with a warning that there will be some new terminology
to learn and a summary of the role of the management accountant.
16.6 The language of management accounting
Management accounting is not a difﬁcult subject but to understand it requires a 
logical mind. To be successful, methods of management accounting must reﬂect a 
reasoned approach to a judgement on a situation problem and a logical basis for 
making decisions. If reason and logic are strong, then it should not be difﬁcult to
understand the approach.
Unfortunately, as with most specialist subjects, management accounting has grown
a language of its own, which is helpful to those who work closely with the subject but
can sometimes cause problems at the outset for newcomers. This chapter has avoided
using specialist terminology, relying on intuitive ideas. However, progress in under-
standing management accounting will be limited without the use of that terminology,
so subsequent chapters will introduce the technical terms, each of which will be
explained. End-of-chapter questions will help you to test your understanding of new
terminology before you move on to each new chapter.
One important difference from ﬁnancial accounting is that there is no ofﬁcial 
regulatory process governing management accounting. This is very different from 
the framework of company law, accounting standards and other regulatory processes
which are found throughout ﬁnancial reporting to external users. Consequently there
is relative freedom in management accounting to tailor the accounting process to the
management function. That does not mean that management accounting is any less
rigorous professionally than other forms of accounting reporting. In the UK there is a
professional body, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA),
which provides guidance to its members on good practice in management accounting.

The Questions section of each chapter has three types of question. ‘Test your understanding’
questions to help you review your reading are in the ‘A’ series of questions. You will find the
answers to these by reading and thinking about the material in the book. ‘Application’ questions
to test your ability to apply technical skills are in the ‘B’ series of questions. Questions requiring
you to show skills in problem solving and evaluation are in the ‘C’ series of questions. A letter

16.7 Summary
You have seen from the discussion in section 16.1.3 and the case studies that management
accounting should direct attention towards strategic issues of surviving and prosper-
ing in a competitive environment. The remaining chapters of this book will introduce
the various techniques that have been developed in management accounting for keep-
ing the score, directing attention and solving problems. The traditional techniques are
described, with current thinking and developments explained and contrasted as relevant.
Key themes in this chapter are:
l Management accounting is concerned with reporting accounting information within
a business, for management use only.
l Management takes its widest meaning in describing all those persons (managers)
responsible for the day-to-day running of a business.
l The managers of a business carry out functions of planning, decision making and
control.
l Management accounting supports these management functions by directing atten-
tion, keeping the score and solving problems.
l The contingency theory of management accounting explains how management
accounting methods have developed in a variety of ways depending on the judge-
ments or decisions required.
l Strategic management accounting pays particular attention to the provision and
analysis of ﬁnancial information on the ﬁrm’s product markets and competitors’
costs and cost structures, and the monitoring of the enterprise’s strategies and those
of its competitors in these markets over a number of periods.

A recently retired police officer has received a lump sum award and a pension. She has a hobby
of making soft toys which have for some years been sold to friends and colleagues at a price
to cover the cost of materials. She now wishes to turn this into a commercial venture and to sell
them through a children’s clothing shop which has agreed to provide shelf space for the sale 
of 20 toys per month. She is not concerned initially about making a high profit and will be 
satisfied with covering costs. The shop will take a fee of 5% of the sale price of each toy sold.

Problem solving and evaluation
C16.1
You have been invited to write a proposal for the development of a new production line to 
process dog food. The production of dog food will take up space previously devoted to cat
food. Write 250 words (approximately) explaining how management accounting would be used
to justify any decision by the production manager to replace cat food with dog food in the 
production process.

Chris and Alison Weston have been manufacturing and selling children’s toys from a workshop
attached to their house. Alison has carried out the manufacturing activity and Chris has pro-
vided the marketing and financial support. The scale of customers’ orders has reached a point
where they must make a decision about renting a production unit on a nearby trading estate
and employing two assistants. One assistant would be required to help make the toys and the
other would carry out routine record keeping, allowing Chris to spend more time on marketing.

Farmers, battered by rising commodity prices and one of
the wettest summers on record, say the price paid at the
farmgate for milk is below their cost of production. In
May [2012], dairy processors were paying farmers a base
rate of 25p to 27p a litre for milk. Then they threatened to
cut the price again to below 25p on average.

b) Extract from industry report 2011
Average cost of milk production on dairy farms
The aggregated data set (Table 1) provides an average
cost of milk production figure of 29.10 pence per litre
(ppl) for the period April 2010 to March 2011. The average British milk price in November 2010 stood at 25.94ppl,
resulting in a 3.16ppl gap between the cost of producing milk (29.10pl) and the price the farmer receives.

Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
462
17.1 Definition of a cost
The cost of an item of input or output may be analysed in terms of two measurements:
1 a physical quantity measurement multiplied by
2 a price measurement.

Where a production process uses 100 kg of material which has a price of £5 per kg,
the cost is £500. Where a production process uses 200 hours of labour time at a rate of
£4 per hour, the cost is £800. That may appear to be a statement of the obvious, but the
breaking down of cost into physical quantity and price is frequently essential for the
application of management accounting methods where the physical ﬂow of inputs and
outputs may sometimes be recorded separately from the unit price. The analysis of the
separate elements of quantity and price will be dealt with in more detail in Chapter 22.
17.2 The need for cost classification
Cost classiﬁcation systems in practice are as varied as the businesses they serve. In
Chapter 16 the functions of management are described as planning, decision making
and control. For purposes of classiﬁcation it is convenient to take planning and control
as a combined function because the classiﬁcations required by each are similar. For
decision making, particular care has to be taken to use classiﬁcations of cost which are
relevant to the decision under consideration.
This chapter will ﬁrst explain three traditional types of cost classiﬁcation:
1 variable costs and fixed costs (section 17.4);
2 direct costs and indirect costs (section 17.5); and
3 product costs and period costs (section 17.6).
Each of these cost classiﬁcations will then be related to the management functions
of planning, decision making and control (section 17.7). It is important to emphasise
here that the three types of cost classiﬁcation are different ways of looking at costs. Any
particular item of cost could have more than one of these classiﬁcations attached to it,
depending on the purpose of the classiﬁcations being used.
Finally, the chapter will explain the importance of correct coding of costs in a 
computer-based system (section 17.8), and will show how costs are selected and reported
according to the unit of the business for which information is required (section 17.9).
17.3 The meaning of ‘activity’ and ‘output’
The word activity will be used in this book as a general description to cover any 
physical operation that takes place in an enterprise. In a business providing bus trans-
port for schoolchildren the activities will include driving the bus, cleaning the bus,
making telephone calls to check routes and times, and ensuring that the administra-
tive requirements, such as insurance and licences, are in place. In a local government
department providing assistance to elderly persons, the activities will include sending
out home helps, paying the home helps, telephoning the clients to arrange visits, and
checking that spending is within the budget allowed. In a manufacturing business
providing ﬂoor cleaning machines the activities will include ordering parts, assemb-
ling parts, delivering the ﬁnished products to shops for sale, taking in returns for
repair under warranty, paying employees, and checking on the quality of the goods
produced. These are all activities and they all cause costs to be incurred. The idea of
activities causing costs (‘driving costs’) is central to much of the classiﬁcation of costs
and the collection of costs relating to a speciﬁc activity. You will ﬁnd later that the
phrase activity-based costing (ABC) has been created to recognise that management
accounting is most effective when it links costs to the activities of the business.
Activities have to be measured. For the soap manufacturer the measure of activity
is the number of cartons of washing powder sold. For the retail store it could be the
Chapter 17 Classification of costs
463

Activity 17.1
Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
464
number of items of clothing sold, or it could be the value of clothing sold. Selling 
a large number of small-value items causes higher stafﬁng costs than does selling 
a small number of high-value items. For the road haulage business the measure of
activity could be the hours worked by drivers or the number of miles driven. Hours
worked takes no account of whether the drivers are on the road or waiting at the
depot. Miles driven are a better measure of productive activity but do not distinguish
full loads from empty trucks. Fuel costs are higher for a full load than for an empty
truck. Activity might be measured using a combined unit of kilogram-miles.
Throughout the following chapters the word activity will be used and measures 
of activity will be described. You will be expected to show your analytical skills in
thinking about the meaning of the word and the relevance of the measure of activity
to cost classiﬁcation and cost behaviour.
Output is a particular kind of activity. It is the product or service provided by the
enterprise or by one of its internal sections. The output of a soap manufacturer is
washing powder; the output of a retail store is the clothing that it sells; the output of
a service engineer might be the repair of washing machines; the output of a garden
centre is pot plants grown from seed; the output of a road haulage business is the
loads delivered by its drivers; the output of a refuse disposal company is the service
of emptying household dustbins; the output of an airline is the passenger loads 
carried; the output of a school is the successful education of its pupils.
(This is another use of the word ‘activity’ where you are asked to pause and think actively
about what you have read.) Think about any activity that you carry out during a week (e.g.
travel to college, eating meals, washing clothes). How would you measure the volume of
that activity in a week? How might the cost of the activity be affected by the volume of
activity? For example, could you share some travel costs; would one large meal cost 
more or less than two small meals; would one large wash cost more or less than two
small washes?
17.4 Variable costs and fixed costs
Costs behave in different ways as the level of activity changes. Some costs increase 
in direct proportion to the increased level of activity. These are called variable costs.
Some costs do not vary, whatever the level of activity. These are called fixed costs.
Some show elements of both features. These are called semi-variable costs. Fixed
costs that increase in steps are called step costs.
17.4.1
Variable costs
Definition
A variable cost is one which varies directly with changes in the level of activity, over a
defined period of time.
Examples of variable costs are:
l materials used to manufacture a unit of output or to provide a type of service
l labour costs of manufacturing a unit of output or providing a type of service
l commission paid to a salesperson
l fuel used by a haulage company.
Table 17.1 shows the costs of clay used by a pottery company for various levels of
output of clay vases for garden ornaments. The clay required for each vase costs £10.

Chapter 17 Classification of costs
465
The total cost increases by £10 for every vase produced, and is described as 
variable. The unit cost is £10 per vase and is constant. Sometimes students ﬁnd it a 
little confusing at this point to decide whether they should be thinking about the total
cost or the unit cost. It may help you to think of yourself as the owner of the business
manufacturing the vases. If you were the owner, you would be most interested in the
total cost because that shows how much ﬁnance you will need in order to carry on 
production. You will only recover the cost of buying the clay when you sell the ﬁnished
goods to the customers. Until then you need ﬁnance to buy the clay. The more you
produce, the more ﬁnance you will need. If you approach the bank manager to help
you ﬁnance the business you will be asked ‘How much do you need?’, a question
which is answered by reference to total cost.
Figure 17.1 shows, in the form of a graph, the information contained in Table 17.1.
It plots activity level (number of vases produced) on the horizontal axis and total cost
on the vertical axis. The graph reinforces the idea that the total cost is a variable cost.
It shows a straight line moving upwards to the right. The fact that the line is straight,
rather than curving, means that the total cost increases in direct proportion to the
increase in activity (that is, total cost increases by £10 for every unit of output).
17.4.2
Fixed costs
Definition
A fixed cost is one which is not affected by changes in the level of activity, over a defined
period of time.
A fixed cost is by deﬁnition unchanged over a period of time, but it may vary in 
the longer term. Rent, for example, might be ﬁxed for a period of one year, but
reviewed at the end of every year with the possibility of an increase being imposed by
the landlord. Other examples of ﬁxed costs are:

l rent of buildings
l salary paid to a supervisor
l advertising in the trade journals
l business rates paid to the local authority
l depreciation of machinery calculated on the straight-line basis.
Continuing our illustration based on a pottery company, Table 17.2 sets out the 
cost to the pottery company of renting a building in which to house its kiln and other
production facilities. The total cost remains ﬁxed at £3,000 irrespective of how many
vases are produced. The unit cost is decreasing as output increases, as shown in 
Table 17.3, because the ﬁxed cost is spread over more vases. Here again, it is more
important usually to think about total cost because unless the pottery can pay its rent
it cannot continue in business. This type of cost is therefore described as a ﬁxed cost.
The cost of rent is shown in graphical form in Figure 17.2.
17.4.3
Semi-variable costs
Definition
A semi-variable cost is one which is partly fixed and partly varies with changes in the
level of activity, over a defined period of time.

Examples of semi-variable cost are:
l ofﬁce salaries where there is a core of long-term secretarial staff plus employment
of temporary staff when activity levels rise;
l maintenance charges where there is a ﬁxed basic charge per year plus a variable 
element depending on the number of call-outs per year.
Table 17.4 sets out the costs incurred by a telephone sales company which pays a
ﬁxed rental of £2,000 per month and a call charge of £1 per telephone sale call. This
total cost has a mixed behaviour, which may be described as semi-variable. It has a
ﬁxed component of £2,000 and a variable component of £1 per telephone sale.
The graph of this semi-variable cost is shown in Figure 17.3. The ﬁxed cost is shown
by the point where the line of the graph meets the vertical axis. The variable com-
ponent is shown by the slope of the graph. The slope of the graph shows the total cost
increasing by £1 for every extra unit of activity. The ﬁxed component of £2,000 is
shown as the point where the line of the graph meets the vertical axis.
Examples of semi-variable cost are:
l ofﬁce salaries where there is a core of long-term secretarial staff plus employment
of temporary staff when activity levels rise;
l maintenance charges where there is a ﬁxed basic charge per year plus a variable 
element depending on the number of call-outs per year.
17.4.4
Step costs
A ﬁxed cost that increases in steps is called a step cost. The cost is ﬁxed over a speciﬁed
level of activity but then increases as a further amount of ﬁxed cost is incurred. One
example is the cost of renting storage space. The rent is unchanged while the output
can be ﬁtted into one store but as soon as a second store has to be rented the total 
rental cost increases. Another example is the cost of paying a supervisor of a team of

employees. Suppose one supervisor can manage up to 20 employees. Cost of super-
vision will be ﬁxed for the level of activity from 1 to 20 employees. Beyond that level
a second supervisor will be needed, causing a sudden increase in ﬁxed cost.
Figure 17.4 shows a step cost of rent increasing annually over ﬁve years. The rental
starts at £1,000 and increases by £100 each year.
The graph in Figure 17.4 is different from those shown earlier in the chapter 
because the horizontal axis measures time rather than activity. However, it is also 
possible to estimate the activity levels expected over the ﬁve-year period. Whatever
the expected activity level, the relationship between total cost and activity level will 
be more complex than the simple ﬁxed, variable and semi-variable relationships
already shown. For the purposes of the rest of this book all the costs you meet will be
simpliﬁed as ﬁxed, variable or semi-variable, within a deﬁned period of time.
17.4.5
Importance of the time period chosen
The extent to which a cost varies with activity depends on the period of time chosen.
In manufacturing picnic tables, the cost of the plastic frame and the table top are vari-
able costs, as is the labour cost of assembly. The annual rent of the warehouse where
the tables are assembled is a fixed cost for the year, but will increase in steps (a step
cost) over a period of several years if there is a rent review each year.
At this point, be sure that you are comfortable with the idea of variable costs, fixed costs
and semi-variable costs. These will appear frequently in later chapters and it is important
to understand them. If you are not familiar with graphs, go back through the section and
try to draw the graph from the data presented. If you are familiar with graphs, make up
some cost patterns and plot these on graph paper to confirm that you can link the

17.5 Direct costs and indirect costs
The costs of a business activity can also be classiﬁed as direct and indirect costs. 
Direct costs are those which are directly related to a particular object (such as a 
product which has been manufactured) or a particular service (such as a repair job
Figure 17.4

Chapter 17 Classification of costs
469
completed) or a particular location (such as a department within the organisation).
Indirect costs are those which cannot be directly related to a particular object or 
service or location and therefore have to be apportioned on a basis which is as fair 
as can be devised.
The ﬁrst question you should ask, whenever you see the words ‘direct’ or ‘indirect’
is ‘Direct or indirect in which respect?’ This will remind you that the words have no
meaning in isolation. An item which is a direct cost for a department could be an 
indirect cost for the units of output produced by the department. Take the example of
electricity consumed in a department. If the department has a meter, then the amount
of electricity used may be identiﬁed directly with the department. However, if all
items produced within the department share the beneﬁt of the electricity supply, then
the cost will need to be shared among them as an indirect cost so far as products are
concerned.
Definitions
The definition of direct and indirect costs depends on the purpose for which the cost 
will be used.
Direct costs are directly traceable to an identifiable unit, such as a product or service or
department of the business, for which costs are to be determined.
Indirect costs are spread over a number of identifiable units of the business, such as
products or services or departments, for which costs are to be determined. Indirect 
costs are also called overhead costs.
Overhead costs are the costs which cannot be identified directly with products or
services.
Fiona McTaggart gives an example of how she would distinguish direct costs and
indirect costs in a particular situation.
FIONA: I was working recently with a publishing firm about to bring out a new children’s
magazine series based on a popular cartoon programme. The publisher had already
incurred market research costs in respect of the new magazine series and it looked like a
good idea.
The magazine is to be produced in a department where there are already ten other 
magazines in production. Writers work freelance and are paid fees on a piecework basis
for each item they write. Graphic artists are employed full-time in the department, produc-
ing designs and drawings for all the magazines. Once the magazine production is com-
pleted, it is sent for external printing at another company which charges on the basis of
volume of output. I was asked to help design a monthly cost analysis statement for the new
magazine.
I pointed out that some costs were easy to identify because they were directly trace-
able to the product. Working back from the end of the story, the external printer’s charge
would be a direct cost of the new magazine because it is directly related to that specific
output. The work of the freelance writers is also a direct cost of the new magazine because
it is easy to make a list of fees paid to them in respect of particular work on the new 
magazine.
The work of the graphic artists is an indirect cost so far as the product is concerned,
because their time is spread over all magazines produced. They do not keep detailed
records of every design they produce. Many designs can be used in more than one maga-
zine title. I suggested that a fair basis of allocation would be to share their cost across all
magazines in proportion to the number of illustrated pages in each. That turned out to be
a bad idea because some illustrated pages may contain full-size pictures while others may
contain a quarter-page design, so it was eventually decided to apply a factor to each page
depending on whether it was fully illustrated or partly illustrated.

Activity 17.3
Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
470
Although the graphic artists are an indirect cost so far as the product is concerned, they
are a direct cost for the department, because they don’t work in any other department. 
I suggested that the full cost of the new magazine would only be known when it was 
also carrying its share of the direct costs and indirect costs of the department as a whole.
Direct costs for the department could include heat and light, maintenance of the operating
equipment, machine depreciation and supervisor’s salary, while indirect costs could
include a share of administration costs and a share of rent and business rates. It is not easy
to ensure that all costs are included for purposes of planning and control.
In her explanation, Fiona has repeatedly used the words ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’, but
at the start of the explanation she is referring to the direct and indirect costs of the new
magazine while at the end she is referring to the direct and indirect costs of the whole
department. The departmental costs, taken together, are all indirect costs so far as the
products of the department are concerned.
Think of some activity observed in your everyday life where costs are involved. (It could,
for example, be travelling on a bus, watching the sales assistant in a shop, or asking the
television repair service to call.) Write down five costs which might be incurred in that
activity. How would you decide which costs are direct and which are indirect?
17.6 Product costs and period costs
Another way of looking at the cost of a unit of output of a business is to distinguish
product costs and period costs. Product costs are those which are identiﬁed with
goods or services intended for sale to customers. These costs belong to the products
and stay with them until they are sold. If goods remain unsold, or work in progress
remains incomplete, then the product costs stay with the unsold goods or work in
progress under the heading of inventory (stock). Period costs are those costs which
are treated as expenses of the period and are not carried as part of the inventory
(stock) value.
Definitions
Product costs are those costs associated with goods or services purchased, or
produced, for sale to customers.
Period costs are those costs which are treated as expenses in the period in which they
are incurred.
Product costs include direct and indirect costs of production. Table 17.5 sets out a
statement of product cost that includes direct and indirect costs. The total of direct 
costs is described as the prime cost.
Table 17.5 uses the words production overhead to describe the total of the indirect
costs of production. Examples are:
l depreciation of machinery
l insurance of the factory premises
l rental of warehouse storage space for raw material.
There are many other types of overhead costs which you will encounter in your
progress through later chapters. They all consist of indirect costs, with the type of cost
determining the particular name given to the overhead cost.

Chapter 17 Classification of costs
471
Definitions
Prime cost is the total of direct materials, direct labour and other direct costs.
Production overhead cost comprises indirect material, indirect labour and other indirect
costs of production.
Example of product costs and period costs in a service business
A ﬁnancial adviser provides each client with three hours’ consultation prior to 
arranging a pension plan. The cost of the adviser’s time is estimated at £500 per 
hour. Advertising costs £2,000 per month. The client is charged £2,100 commission on
completion of the three-hour sequence of consultation. During one week the ﬁnancial
adviser provides 20 hours of consultation. The statement of costs would be:

Labour: 20 hours at £500 per hour

Suppose that the consultations are complete for six clients (18 hours) but unﬁnished
for one client, who has been provided with only two hours’ consultation by the end of
the week. The incomplete consultation is described as work in progress. There was no
work in progress at the start of the week. The calculation of proﬁt would be:

Example of product costs and period costs in a manufacturing
business
A toy manufacturer produces hand-crafted rocking horses. During one week six rock-
ing horses are completed. The direct materials costs of wood and leather materials
amount to £180 per completed horse. The indirect materials cost of glue and paint
amount to £20 per completed horse. The direct labour cost for craft working is 
£150 per completed horse. The indirect labour cost of handling within the production
department is £50 per completed horse. Advertising amounted to £1,200 per week.

In each of these examples the product cost of completed services and of goods sold
is matched against sales revenue of the week. The product cost of work in progress
and of unsold goods is carried in the inventory (stock) valuation to be matched against
sales revenue of a future week. The period costs are all matched against sales revenue
of the week.
In a service organisation, all costs incurred up to the point of completion of the ser-
vice are regarded as product costs. Any costs incurred beyond the act of service, such
as advertising the service or collecting cash from customers, would be a period cost.
In a manufacturing organisation, all manufacturing costs are regarded as product
costs. This will include the direct and indirect costs of manufacturing. Chapter 19 will
explain the methods of calculating the indirect manufacturing costs for each product
item. Costs incurred beyond the completion of manufacture, such as the costs of
administration and selling, are period costs. The valuation of unsold inventory (stock)
is based on the product cost.
17.7 Cost classification for planning, decision making 
and control
Sections 17.4, 17.5 and 17.6 have described ﬁxed and variable costs, direct and indirect
costs and product and period costs. Each of these may have a role to play in planning,
decision making and control. The idea of contingency, explained in Chapter 16, is
important here; the classiﬁcation is chosen to suit the intended use.
17.7.1
Planning
Planning involves looking forward and asking questions of the ‘what if . . . ?’ type.
Table 17.6 gives examples of planning questions and sets out the cost classiﬁcations
that may be appropriate to each.

Chapter 17 Classification of costs

17.7.2
Decision making
Decision making involves asking questions of the type ‘Should we do . . . ?’ Table 17.7
gives examples of decision-making questions and sets out the cost classiﬁcations that
may be appropriate to each.
For decision-making purposes, the key word is ‘relevance’. The costs used in the
decision-making process must only be those which are relevant to the decision. In this
respect, the classiﬁcation into variable and ﬁxed costs is particularly important. That
is because, in the short term, little can be done by a business in relation to fixed costs,
so that the need for a decision may focus attention on the variable costs. Fiona
McTaggart explains how she would use such a classiﬁcation to present information for
decision making.
FIONA: The Garden Decor Company is thinking of making two garden ornaments, gnomes
and herons. The variable cost of making a gnome would be £24 and the variable cost of
making a heron would be £14. Market research indicates that garden ornaments of similar
types are selling in the shops for around £20 each. Output up to the level of 20,000 garden
ornaments, in any combination of output of each, would lead to fixed rental and insurance
costs of £6,000.
Table 17.7
Cost classification for decision-making purposes
Decision-making question
1 Should the company produce 
components in this country or 
produce them overseas?
2 Should the company continue to 
provide a service when demand 
is falling?
Cost classification
Fixed and variable costs. The variable costs
of production should be compared for each
country. Fixed costs are not relevant to the
decision if they are incurred regardless of
the location. Fixed costs are relevant if they
can be avoided by changing location.
Fixed and variable costs. The price paid by
customers must at least cover the variable
costs. In the longer term there must be
sufficient revenue to cover variable and 
fixed costs.
Table 17.6
Cost classification for planning purposes
Planning question
1 What is the cost impact of a 
change in levels of production over 
a period of time?
2 What is the cost effect of planning 
to expand operations by opening 
a new outlet in a separate location?
3 What is the cost impact of 
remaining open for longer hours to 
improve on existing client services?
Cost classification
Fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs 
will not be affected by production levels;
variable costs will alter proportionately.
Direct and indirect costs, in relation to 
the location. The direct costs will include 
the rental and running costs of the chosen
location; indirect costs will be that location’s
share of the general running costs of the
business.
Fixed and variable costs. The new service
will incur variable costs. Will it cause any
step increase in fixed costs?

Activity 17.4
Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
474
My recommendation would be that the company should not even contemplate the 
garden gnomes because the expected selling price of £20 will not cover the variable cost
of £24 per unit. The company will make a loss as it produces each item. The selling price
of the herons would cover their variable cost and make a contribution of £6 each (£20
minus £14) to the fixed cost. If they can sell 1,000 herons or more, the £6 contribution from
each will cover the £6,000 additional fixed costs and any further herons sold will give a
profit clear of fixed costs.
Fiona has used the word ‘contribution’ in this discussion. You can probably guess
its meaning from the context in which it is used, but you will meet the word again as
a technical term in Chapter 20.
17.7.3
Control
Control involves looking back and asking questions of the ‘how and why . . . ?’ type.
Table 17.8 gives examples of control questions and sets out the cost classiﬁcations that
may be appropriate to each.
Imagine you are the manager of a department store in the centre of town. Write down 
one planning question, one decision-making question and one control question that you
might ask and suggest a cost classification that would provide management accounting
information relevant to the question.
17.7.4
Cost classification to meet changing circumstances
Chapter 16 noted the contingency approach to management accounting which empha-
sises that management accounting should be ﬂexible to meet changing circumstances
Table 17.8
Cost classification for control purposes
Control question
1 How closely do the costs of each 
product match the targets set?
2 How closely do the costs of a 
service department match the 
budget set for the department?
3 Is the value of the inventory 
(stock) of unsold goods stated 
correctly?
Cost classification
Direct and indirect costs in relation to the
product. If the direct costs do not match the
targets set then questions must be asked
about the product itself. If the indirect costs
do not match the targets then questions
must be asked about the control of those
costs and the method of apportioning
(sharing) them across the products.
Direct and indirect costs related to the
department. The direct costs are closely
under the control of the departmental
manager, who should explain any
deviations. The indirect costs are shared
across several departments and so
questions may be asked about the basis 
of apportioning (sharing) those costs.
Product costs and period costs. The
unsold inventory (stock) should be carrying
its share of the product costs.

Chapter 17 Classification of costs
475
of planning, decision making and control. Some of the changes of recent years, to
which management accounting practices have been adapted, are:
l The need to identify more closely the costs incurred in a business with the activities
which drive those costs.
l The introduction of new technologies in which labour costs have diminished in
relation to the cost of operating ﬂexible computer-based operating systems.
l The reduction in inventory (stock) of raw materials and ﬁnished goods as the busi-
ness has linked up with suppliers and customers to ensure that items are delivered
just at the time when they are needed.
l The emphasis on managing the quality of output and the cost of achieving that
quality.
l Comparing the cost structures of the business with those of others in the industry.
These have led particular businesses to develop management accounting practices
which suit their particular needs. Observers of those new practices, particularly aca-
demic writers, have identiﬁed new patterns of management accounting to which they
have given titles such as:
l activity-based costing
l just-in-time purchasing
l cost of quality
l benchmarking costs.
These approaches reﬂect dissatisfaction with the traditional approach in particular
instances, but they do not indicate that the traditional approach has entirely failed.
Consequently it remains necessary to study the traditional approach while having
regard to continuing developments.
17.8 Cost coding
We will now look in more detail at an approach to cost recording that allows classi-
ﬁcation systems to be applied accurately and speedily.
Most costing systems are computerised. In a computerised system every cost item
is given a cost code number which allows the cost to be traced through the computer-
ised system. The coding is critical to effective use of the cost information. Computers
allow selective retrieval of information quickly, but only if the coding is correctly
designed to suit the needs of the organisation.
A cost code must be unique to the cost which it identiﬁes. The code should be as
short as possible and it is preferable to have a code structure which creates consistent
images in the mind of the user. The code may be entirely numerical or may have a
mixture of letters and numbers (an alphanumeric code).
Definition
A cost code is a system of letters and numbers designed to give a series of unique
labels which help in classification and analysis of cost information.
The design of the coding system and the assignment of code numbers should 
be carried out centrally so that the system is consistent throughout the organisation.
The code system may have built into it the structure of the organisation, so that the
code starts by specifying a major unit of the organisation and gradually narrows 
down to a particular cost in a particular location. Here is Fiona McTaggart to explain
a cost coding system she has recently designed.

Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
476
Activity 17.5
FIONA: This company, producing and selling books, has 15 different departments. Within
each department there are up to six cost centres. There are three different types of book
– reference, academic and leisure. The list of costs to be coded contains 350 items, down
to detail such as bindings purchased for special strength in reference works.
The coding is based on a six-digit alphanumeric code. The department is represented
by the first digit of the code, taking one of the letters A to Z (except that the company
decided not to use letters I and O because of the confusion with numerical digits). Each
cost centre has a letter code, which appears in the second position. (Again the letters I and
O are not used.) The next digit is the letter R, A or L depending on whether the book is ref-
erence, academic or leisure. The last three digits are numbers taken from a cost code list
which covers all 350 items but which could in principle expand up to 999 items in total.
Within those three digits, there is further grouping of costs by code – for example, 100 to
199 are reserved for fixed asset items; 200 to 399 are various types of material cost; 
400 to 599 are various types of labour cost; 600 to 899 are a whole range of production
overhead costs; and 900 to 999 are administration and selling costs.
So, under code number HCA246, it would be possible to find the cost of paper used in
printing an academic textbook on the new printing machine. Working backwards through
the code, item 246 is paper, letter A is an academic book, letter C denotes the new printing
machine (which is itself a cost centre) and letter H indicates the printing department.
Create a six-digit coding system which would allow you to classify all the items of
expenditure you make in a year. (You will need to write down the items of expenditure
first of all and then look for patterns which could be represented in a code.) To test your
code, ask a friend to write down three transactions, converting them to code. Then use
your knowledge of the code to tell your friend what the three transactions were.
17.9 Cost selection and reporting
Once the costs have been coded, a computerised accounting system can be pro-
grammed to retrieve the costs in a systematic manner for reporting purposes. The code
structure must include alphanumeric characters that cover each of the purposes for
which cost is required.
The code structure outlined by Fiona McTaggart above would allow classiﬁcation
of cost by reference to items of output and would allow classiﬁcation of cost by refer-
ence to a cost centre. A cost centre is only one of the units into which an organisation
is subdivided for cost collection purposes. Two others are a profit centre and an
investment centre. The chapter ends with deﬁnitions of the following terms that will
be encountered in subsequent chapters in relation to cost selection and reporting: cost
centre, proﬁt centre and investment centre.
17.9.1
Cost centre
A cost centre is a unit of the organisation in respect of which a manager is responsible
for costs under their control. A cost centre could be a location (e.g. a department) 
or a function (e.g. the manufacture of a product), or it could even be a production
machine or group of similar machines. One essential feature of a cost centre is that it
must be a homogeneous unit carrying out a single form of activity. A second essential
feature is that it must correspond to an identiﬁable managerial responsibility.
Identiﬁcation of a cost centre with managerial responsibility leads to a further type
of cost classiﬁcation, namely controllable and non-controllable costs. Costs allocated

Chapter 17 Classification of costs
477
to a cost centre should be classiﬁed according to whether they are controllable or 
non-controllable by the manager of that cost centre.
Definitions
A cost centre is a unit of the organisation in respect of which a manager is responsible
for costs under their control.
A controllable cost is one which is capable of being managed by the person responsible
for the cost centre, profit centre or investment centre to which the cost is reported.
17.9.2
Profit centre
A profit centre is a unit of the organisation in respect of which a manager is responsible
for revenue as well as costs. In practice an operating division would be a proﬁt centre
if it produced output whose selling price could be determined in some manner. The
selling price could be based on an internal transfer between departments at an 
agreed price. It would not necessarily require a sale to a third party outside the busi-
ness entity.
A proﬁt centre is similar to a cost centre in that it must relate to an area of mana-
gerial responsibility, although the activity may be less homogeneous than that of a cost
centre. The proﬁt centre, though, is likely to contain more than one cost centre.
Definition
A profit centre is a unit of the organisation in respect of which a manager is responsible
for revenue as well as costs.
17.9.3
Investment centre
An investment centre is a unit of the organisation in respect of which a manager 
is responsible for capital investment decisions as well as revenue and costs. These
decisions could be related to such matters as purchase and disposal of equipment or
acquisition of premises. The investment centre will be undertaking business activity 
in such a way that it will probably carry out an operation which is signiﬁcant to the
overall proﬁt-earning capacity of the organisation. As is the case with a proﬁt centre,
the investment centre must relate to an area of managerial responsibility, but the 
activities of the investment centre need not be homogeneous. There will probably be a
number of cost centres and proﬁt centres within the investment centre.
Definition
An investment centre is a unit of the organisation in respect of which a manager is
responsible for capital investment decisions as well as revenue and costs.
17.10 Summary
Key themes in this chapter are:
l Costs may be classiﬁed using one or more of the following pairs of deﬁnitions:
l fixed/variable cost
l direct/indirect cost
l product/period cost.
l The choice of cost classiﬁcation should be matched to the management function of
planning, decision making or control.

l Cost coding is essential to make the cost classiﬁcation system operational in a 
computer-based recording system.
l Cost classiﬁcation must be relevant to the responsibility level for which the costs are
reported, which may be a cost centre, or a profit centre, or an investment centre.
The chapter has set out the basic terminology of cost classiﬁcation to be used
throughout the book. In later chapters you will meet more detailed classiﬁcations such
as controllable/non-controllable and avoidable/unavoidable.

however, be aware that there is no standard terminology in the ﬁeld of management
accounting, so every author will have a slightly different form of wording to deﬁne a given
concept.

Activities for study groups
Case 17.1
You are the management team in a business which makes self-assembly kitchen units and sells
them to large do-it-yourself stores. One person should take on the role of the financial controller
but the rest of the team may take any managerial roles they choose. Each manager will have
responsibility for a cost centre. The group should decide, at the outset, on the name and 
purpose of each cost centre.
In stage 1 of the team exercise, each manager should write down the name of the cost 
centre and a list of the costs for which the manager expects to have responsibility. A copy of
the cost centre name and the list of costs should be supplied to each member of the team.
In stage 2, each manager should separately write down his or her requirements from a 
company-wide cost coding system, yet to be designed, which has been specified in outline as
having six alphanumeric characters. Each manager should also make a note of any costs which
are shared with another manager or managers.
While the managers are carrying out the second stage, the financial controller should 
prepare a cost coding system which would meet the needs as specified on the lists of costs
provided by each manager from stage 1.

482
In stage 3, the group should come together for a management meeting at which the financial
controller will provide his or her cost coding system and each manager will respond with his or
her ideas. If possible, a mutually agreed solution should be found but, at the very least, the
group should identify the areas where further negotiation will be required. Finally, the group
should make a five-minute presentation to the class describing the negotiations on the coding
system and commenting on the practical problems of such negotiation.
Case 17.2
The group is the management team of a supermarket chain operating ten shops in out-of-town
locations. Each member of the group should choose a management role, one of which must be
the financial controller. Work together to prepare a proposal for establishing one profit centre,
together with three cost centres within the profit centre for which each manager will be respon-
sible, writing a definition of the responsibilities of each profit centre and cost centre.
Then work together further to produce a list of costs for each cost centre, in a table as follows:
Type of cost
Fixed/variable cost
Direct/indirect for 
Product/period cost
the cost centre
Set out one question relating to planning, one question relating to control and one question
relating to decision making. Explain how the table of cost classification will help answer each
of these questions.

REAL WORLD CASE
This case study shows a typical situation in which management accounting can be helpful.
Read the case study now, but only attempt the discussion points after you have finished
studying the chapter.
Almost two-thirds of average supply chain
expense for UK supermarkets comes from
the cost of taking goods the ‘last mile’ to
stores, according to research by strategy
consultants Roland Berger.
The consultancy says this high proportion –
65 per cent – has increased sharply in
recent years as the large grocery groups
have focused their expansion on
convenience stores. These produce better
margins than hypermarkets but it costs
more to keep them stocked. The rise in
cost also reflects the growth in online
grocery sales, which are more expensive to pick and deliver.
‘Most grocers, if they had the chance, would open only large stores,’ says Neil Saunders of retail
consultancy Verdict. ‘But geography and the state of the market work against that. Grocers have all
been pushed down this convenience route in a much greater way.’
Between 2010 and 2014, the four biggest supermarket groups – Tesco, Asda, J Sainsbury and Wm
Morrison – together plan to open or extend stores equivalent to about 19m square feet, and much of
that space will be in smaller outlets. Michael Jary, partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants, forecasts
that sales through the online channel are likely to more than double to around 8 per cent of all grocery
sales by 2020. The challenge for addressing the ‘last mile’ costs is acute.
‘The major multiples have made great strides in optimising the back end of the supply chain by close
collaboration with their suppliers, through activities such as central warehouse delivery and other
practices,’ says Tim Manasseh, a partner at Roland Berger. ‘But the costs involved in servicing the
“last mile” have escalated considerably.’ For convenience stores, he cites factors such as the high
cost of in-store storage space, and the expense of writing off unsold fresh food.

Karen Hubbard, operations director at Asda, responsible for stores between 5,000 and 25,000 square
ft, says the distribution system must also take into account factors such as restrictions on when
deliveries can take place. Asda also operates 100 smaller stores where the issues are similar to those
facing the classic convenience store.
The answer for Asda has been to build a supply chain from scratch just for its smaller stores to help
keep prices in line across all its formats. It has also reduced the size of its computers in smaller
stores and split them up into units that can fit into limited space. ‘They are cut up into little pieces 
and kept under the check outs,’ Ms Hubbard says.
Despite the inherently higher expense involved in keeping convenience stores stocked, industry
experts believe grocers can still bear down on costs.
One way is scale. Mr Saunders says the density of Tesco and Sainsbury convenience stores, for
example, in London gives them an advantage because a few lorry loads of deliveries can service
several stores. ‘If you are dealing with just one or two, then it’s not very efficient in terms of fuel,
driver time, and staff time picking the goods for delivery.’
Another approach is to improve sales by ensuring that the store is not just a cut-down version of a
supermarket. Asda is tailoring its offer to local demand, for example, stocking more Asian ingredients
in its store in South Harrow, and reducing the amount of space it would typically give to beers, wines
and spirits. Managing demand also means making sure the store does not waste shelf space: if a
group knows that its convenience stores need big orders of bread on Monday morning but not on
Friday, it can adjust deliveries accordingly.
Thirdly, there is persuading customers to buy premium products, increasing the size of the average
spend and boosting margins.
Wm Morrison, which is conducting a trial of three convenience stores in the north of England, stocks
fresh meat and fish in its pilot store at Ilkley, Yorkshire, since these can easily be prepared at its
nearby supermarket at Keighley. The Ilkley store also boasts features such as a ‘grind your own
coffee’ point and a fresh orange juicer.
‘If people are going to come in and buy steak and a bottle of wine it completely changes the
economics,’ says Miles Foster, who is leading Morrison’s convenience store trial. The group has
promised that fresh products will cost no more in convenience stores than in other formats, but even
so the amount spent by the average customer in the Ilkley store is ‘well above’ the industry mean of
about £5, he says.
Managing costs in grocery internet sales is even trickier. ‘This is why people like Ocado have
struggled so much,’ says Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital. ‘If you take it from the farm gate to the
kitchen, the biggest cost of the supply chain is the customer picking the product off the shelf, putting
it in the car and taking it home.’
In the mature and competitive UK food retailing market, convenience and online shopping offer the
best prospects of growth. So though different supermarkets are working on different solutions, they
must share a common determination to crack the costs.

18.1 Introduction
Some businesses manufacture goods, while others perform a service. Whatever the
nature of the business, all will at some stage use materials, they will employ labour
and they will incur overhead costs (the name given to other costs which are necessary
to the operation of the manufacturing or service process).
In this chapter we outline traditional procedures for recording the costs of materials,
labour and production overheads and indicate some of the problems which are
encountered. Many of these procedures remain a cornerstone of present-day manage-
ment accounting but others, particularly those related to overhead costs, have caused
management accountants to look for new procedures.
A statement of the cost of a unit of output provides a useful starting point for this
chapter in setting out a list of items to be explained in more detail (see Exhibit 18.1).
This chapter explains how costs are recorded and traced to products. Products may
be goods or services. Direct costs are directly traceable to the relevant products.
Indirect costs (overheads) must be shared across more than one product. Figure 18.1
summarises the way in which costs are traced to products. It relates to a cost centre
where the output consists of three different products (goods or services). Materials
and labour are part of the product cost (where products may be goods or services).
The direct materials and direct labour are part of the prime cost. The indirect 
materials and indirect labour are part of the production overhead costs.
Definition
Prime cost is the cost of direct materials, direct labour and other direct costs of
production.
The direct costs in Figure 18.1 consist of direct materials, direct labour and any
other costs that are directly identiﬁable with a product. We know how much material
is needed for the product, we know how much labour time is worked on the product
and we know about any other costs related only to that product. So the arrows ﬂowing
downwards in Figure 18.1 show the direct costs of each product ﬂowing directly to
that product.
Some materials, some labour and some other costs are classiﬁed as indirect because
they are spread across a range of products. These have to be shared in some way across
the products. Figure 18.1 shows the overhead costs being apportioned (‘shared’)
across products. One debate in management accounting focuses on how to carry 
out that process of apportionment. This chapter presents two approaches in that
debate.

Activity 18.1
Sections 18.2 and 18.3 of this chapter describe methods for recording and control-
ling the costs of materials and labour. The nature of the materials and labour, and the
type of output of the enterprise, will lead to classiﬁcation of direct and indirect costs
of materials and labour.
Section 18.4 brings together all the indirect costs of production and groups them
under the heading production overhead cost. It describes the process of ensuring that
overhead costs reach the products, using the traditional approach. Section 18.5 sets out
an alternative to section 18.4 by sharing out the production overhead costs using an
activity-based costing (ABC) approach. Section 18.6 compares the traditional and the
ABC approaches.
Look at some item in the room where you are sitting as you read this chapter (perhaps 
a table or a desk or a window). What words would you use to describe the cost of
producing that item (e.g. wood, plastic, work in assembly, running costs of workshop)?
How would you start to measure the cost of producing that item? Write down your
thoughts now, and then look back after you have finished this chapter. That will help 
you consider what you have learned from the chapter.
18.2 Accounting for materials costs
Figure 18.2 shows the sequence of activities which control the ordering, delivery 
and safekeeping of materials, together with the subsequent payment to suppliers.
Information which is useful for accounting purposes will be collected from the docu-
mentation that is created during these procedures.

It is not difﬁcult to see that with so many procedures involved there needs to be
careful control over materials moving into, and out of, store. Each stage in the process
requires a document as evidence that the transaction or process has been completed
correctly. Every business has a different system of documentation which suits its 
particular needs. The following description is typical of the documents encountered 
in materials handling and control. Italics are used to indicate each document.
18.2.1
Materials handling and control documentation
When the storekeeper notes that the inventory (stock) has fallen to the minimum level,
triggering a reorder requirement, a purchase requisition will be sent to the buying
department. The buying department will have a list of items which the production
manager wishes to have available in store and the quantity to be reordered. Provided
the item is on that list, the buying department will send a purchase order to the supplier.
In some cases the production manager may have issued a purchase requisition directly
because a new item of materials, not previously held in store, is required. It is the
responsibility of the buying department to choose a supplier who provides reliable
service and a high-quality product at a competitive price. A copy of the purchase order
will be sent to the storekeeper as notiﬁcation that the materials have been ordered.
When the materials arrive from the supplier, the driver of the delivery vehicle 
will bring a delivery note which the storekeeper will sign, after checking against the
quantities received and noting any discrepancies. The storekeeper will then prepare a
Figure 18.2
Materials control procedures

Chapter 18 Product costs: materials, labour and overheads
489
materials received note, sending one copy to the buying department and another to the
accounts department. Soon after the materials arrive, the accounts department will
receive the supplier’s invoice, showing the quantities of the materials supplied and the
price charged for them. The accounts department will check the quantities against the
materials received note and will check the invoice price against an agreed price list
provided by the buying department. If all is correct, the accounts department will pay
the supplier.
Finally, the materials will be needed by the various production departments. To
release the materials from store, the production departments will produce a stores 
requisition which the storekeeper will check and will then pass on to the accounts
department for use in keeping the management accounting records.
Exhibit 18.2 provides a summary of the various documents, their origin, destination
and use for recording purposes. The two essential pieces of information for deter-
mining the cost of materials used in production are the price per unit and the quantity 
of materials issued. These are highlighted in bold in Exhibit 18.2. As you will see, the
price and quantity are taken from different documents, the supplier’s price being
taken from the invoice while the quantity of materials used is taken from the stores
requisition.
The documents listed in Exhibit 18.2 are referred to as primary sources because they
form the ﬁrst evidence that a transaction or event has taken place. From these primary
sources the accounting records are created. Clearly, the accuracy of the account-
ing records is heavily dependent on careful and accurate processing of the primary
documents.
18.2.2
Materials costs when input prices are changing
One problem faced by the accounts department is that suppliers change their prices
from time to time. Materials held in store may have arrived at different times and at

different unit prices. How does the accounts department decide on the unit price to be
charged to each job when all the materials look the same once they are taken into
store? The usual procedure is to assume, for pricing purposes, that the ﬁrst materials
to arrive in store are the ﬁrst ones to leave. This is usually abbreviated to FIFO (ﬁrst in
ﬁrst out).
Some businesses prefer to use the average cost of all items in inventory (stock) as
the basis for pricing issues. For management purposes the best method for the 
purpose should be applied. Management accounting escapes the constraints of statute
law, accounting standards and tax law which restrict practice in ﬁnancial accounting.
(Section 9.8.3 of Chapter 9 shows a detailed example of pricing the issue of materials
when input prices are changing.)
18.2.3
Costs of wastage and scrap
The term waste is applied to any materials that have no value, whatever the reason. If
some waste material can be sold for disposal, usually at a very low price in relation to
its original cost, then it is called scrap.
In the ideal situation, all materials received into stores are issued to production.
Real life is not always like that, because stores may disappear before they have a
chance to be used in the production process. The disappearance may be caused by
deterioration or damage in store, the materials may become obsolete or unsuitable for
use in production or they may be stolen. Sometimes materials may appear to have
gone missing when in reality it is the accounting records which are incorrect because
a stores requisition note has been lost or an item has been allocated to the wrong job-
cost record, or perhaps there is a calculation error on a stores list. It is always worth-
while to check the accuracy of the accounting records before assuming that materials
have disappeared.
For the management accountant the loss of materials creates another cost problem.
The cost must be charged somewhere in the system but it cannot appear as a direct
cost because the materials never reached the production department. The cost of
wastage therefore has to be noted as a separate indirect materials cost, to be spread
over the cost of all products. If any cash can be recovered by selling as scrap some
obsolete or damaged materials, then the proceeds of sale may be recorded as reducing
the overall cost of wastage.
18.2.4
Cost classification and materials costs
The cost classiﬁcation system is required to show whether costs are direct or indirect
and whether they are fixed or variable.
How are direct and indirect materials costs distinguished?
The earlier description of materials costing procedures has shown how multiplying
unit price by the quantity of materials used will give a measure of cost, although there
may need to be a choice of unit price to be applied (see section 18.2.2). Materials issued
to production are usually made available on the basis of a stores requisition, so there
should be no problem in identifying direct materials costs for the job in question.
Some materials costs may be spread over a range of products and activities, each 
of which must take a share. The case of wastage before the materials are issued to 
production has already been discussed. Other examples would include transportation
costs and all the costs of receiving, issuing and handling stores (such as the store-
keeper’s wages). It is preferable to record materials costs as direct costs, identiﬁed with
the job, wherever possible. On the other hand, the cost of spending time on keeping
records must be weighed against more productive uses of that time.

Chapter 18 Product costs: materials, labour and overheads
491
Activity 18.2
How are fixed and variable materials costs distinguished?
Most materials costs will be variable costs, irrespective of whether they are direct or
indirect so far as the job is concerned. If output is not being achieved, then materials
will not be used and will be held in store for use in a future period.
To be a fixed cost, the materials would have to be required for use in a period irre-
spective of whether or not production takes place. That is an unlikely situation in most
business operations.
You have been employed as a storekeeper at a superstore selling vehicle accessories.
Write down the main procedures you would carry out to ensure that:
l the materials in store are held securely;
l the accounting records of inventory (stock) are accurate; and
l the materials are issued only to authorised persons.
18.3 Accounting for labour costs
The cost of any resource used in a business is the product of the amount of resource
used and the price per unit of the resource. For the resource of labour, the amount 
of resource is usually measured in terms of hours worked and the price is usually
expressed as a rate paid per hour.
18.3.1
Types of pay scheme
The ﬁrst problem which the management accountant meets in dealing with labour
costs is that different employees are on different pay schemes. Some employees
receive a monthly salary, paid at the end of the month worked. They are expected to
work whatever number of hours is necessary to complete the tasks assigned to them.
This type of remuneration is most commonly found in the case of administrative staff
where the emphasis is on undertaking tasks which are necessary to the overall duties
and responsibilities of the post. Other employees receive a basic salary per week, 
or per month, which is augmented by extra payments depending on output levels or
targets achieved. This type of pay scheme has a ‘loyalty’ element in the basic salary
together with a reward for effort in the output-related extra payments. Other employees
may be paid an hourly rate based on actual hours worked, receiving no payment
where no hours are worked. Finally, there may be some employees paid on a piece-
work basis, receiving a ﬁxed amount for every item produced, regardless of time
taken. To add to the problem, there may be labour costs of the business which are not
paid to the employee in the form of wages or salary. These would include the pro-
vision of a car, free medical insurance, clothing allowances, rent allowances, relocation
and disruption payments, inducements to join the company and lump sum payments
on leaving the company. There are also the employer’s labour costs, such as employer’s
contributions to National Insurance, which are part of the total labour cost as far as the
business is concerned.
18.3.2
Determining the labour cost in an item of output
The differences outlined in section 18.3.1 all add to the problems of the management
accountant in converting the variety of schemes to a uniform basis for costing pur-
poses. Usually, calculating a rate per hour is sufﬁcient to provide such a uniform basis,

Activity 18.3
Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
492
provided the number of hours worked is known. The cost of labour used on any job
may then be determined by multiplying the hourly cost by the number of hours
worked.
18.3.3
Cost classification and labour costs
The classiﬁcation system is concerned with whether costs are direct or indirect and
whether they are fixed or variable.
How are direct and indirect labour costs distinguished?
Multiplying unit cost by the number of hours worked is ﬁne provided there is a time
record and provided that time can be allocated exclusively to one product at a time. In
some businesses it might be feasible to keep track of specialist labour time spent on
each product. This part of the labour cost is regarded as the direct cost.
Some labour costs may never be allocated directly to a speciﬁc job because they are
spread over a range of jobs and activities, each of which must take a share (e.g. super-
visor’s salary, cleaner’s wages, or non-productive time when skilled employees are not
able to work because equipment needs attention). This part of the labour cost is called
indirect cost. Indirect labour costs also include holiday pay, bonus payments and over-
time pay. That gives the management accountant a further problem in deciding on a
fair basis of apportionment of indirect labour costs. Apportionment of indirect costs
will be dealt with in section 18.5 on production overhead costs.
How are fixed and variable labour costs distinguished?
One quite difﬁcult question with labour costs is to decide whether they are ﬁxed or
variable costs. If the employee is on a contract which provides a ﬁxed basic salary, 
then the total salary is a ﬁxed cost for the organisation. The employee will then spend
time on producing output and that amount of time will vary depending on the level
of output. Thus the direct labour cost attributable to that employee will be a variable
cost, depending on level of output. The remaining time, when the employee is not 
producing output, will be classed as an indirect cost of non-productive labour.
18.3.4
Recording labour costs
The system for recording labour costs must be capable of dealing with the payroll
aspects (keeping track of how much is paid to each employee) and with the cost 
allocation aspect of tracing those payroll costs, together with other labour costs, to the
products of the business. That in turn requires a careful recording of the total time
worked by the employees each week, analysed into the time spent on each product
and the amount of non-productive time.
Direct labour costs will be calculated using hours worked and the hourly rate 
for each employee. The hours worked will be collected from employee time sheets
which show the time spent on each product unit. Hourly rates for each employee will 
be available from personnel records, based on the cost of employing that particular
person.
In practice, it is likely that costing records will be kept by computer, with employees
entering data online.
You are employed in the personnel department of a large organisation. Explain how the
records kept by the personnel department would be useful to the accounting department
in preparing the monthly payroll.

18.4 Production overheads: traditional approach
Production overhead was deﬁned in Chapter 17 as comprising indirect materials,
indirect labour and other indirect costs of production. Indirect materials and in-
direct labour have been explained earlier in this chapter. Other indirect costs will 
include any item which relates to production and which is not a materials cost or a
labour cost. The type of indirect cost will depend on the nature of the business and,
in particular, on whether it is a manufacturing business or a service business. 
Examples are:
l In a manufacturing business: repair of machinery; rent of factory buildings; and
safety procedures.
l In a service business: cost of transport to jobs; replacement of tools; and protective
clothing.
Whatever their nature, all the production overhead costs have to be absorbed into
the products.
Normally the management accountant has to devise a scheme of allocation and
apportionment. There are some essential features for any successful scheme. It 
must be:
l fair to all parties involved in the process of allocation and apportionment;
l representative of the beneﬁt each party gains from the shared cost;
l relatively quick to apply so that provision of information is not delayed;
l understandable by all concerned.
This chapter will use arithmetically simple models for illustrative purposes, although
the mechanism for apportionment does not have to be arithmetically simple provided
a computer can be used.
The process to be described here has three stages:
1 allocating and apportioning indirect costs to cost centres;
2 apportioning service department costs over production cost centres;
3 absorbing costs into products.
Definitions
Allocate means to assign a whole item of cost, or of revenue, to a single cost unit,
centre, account or time period.
Apportion means to spread costs over two or more cost units, centres, accounts or time
periods. (It is referred to by some books as ‘indirect allocation’.)
Absorb means to attach overhead costs to products or services.
Allocation, apportionment and absorption in job costing
l Direct materials are allocated to products.
l Direct labour costs are allocated to products.
l Indirect materials costs and indirect labour costs are allocated and apportioned to
cost centres.
l Total indirect costs of service cost centres are apportioned over production cost 
centres.
l Total overhead costs of production cost centres are absorbed into products.1
Figure 18.3 provides a diagram to show the three stages in the ﬂow of indirect costs.
The calculations are explained in detail in section 18.4.4.

18.4.1
Allocating and apportioning indirect costs to cost centres
There are two main types of cost centre in any business, namely service cost centres
and production cost centres. The production cost centres are those directly involved
in the production activity. The service cost centres are not directly involved in the
production activity but provide essential backup. To sustain long-term proﬁtability,
the products of the business must sell at a price which makes a proﬁt after covering
the costs of the service cost centres as well as those of the production cost centres.
The management accountant will ﬁrst of all divide the overhead costs into two 
categories: those which may be allocated as a whole to each cost centre, and those
which have to be apportioned (or shared) over a number of cost centres according to
how the cost centres beneﬁt from the cost incurred. Exhibit 18.3 sets out some common
methods of apportionment where costs are regarded as indirect so far as each cost 
centre is concerned.
If the records were sufﬁciently detailed, then most of the costs in Exhibit 18.3 could
be turned into items of cost which could be allocated as a whole to each cost centre,
avoiding the need for apportionment. Electricity meters could be installed in each 
cost centre to measure directly the cost of heating and lighting. Employees could be
given tickets for the canteen which could be collected and recorded for each cost 
centre. The production supervisor could keep a diary of time spent in each cost centre.
Depreciation could be calculated for each machine. The insurance company could be
asked to quote a separate premium for each machine. However, all these procedures
would in themselves create a new cost of administration which the business might
decide was too high a price to pay for a marginal improvement in the accuracy of 
allocation of costs.

18.4.2
Apportioning service department costs over production 
cost centres
As explained earlier, service cost centres exist to support production but do not make
a direct contribution to the product. Once the costs of the organisation have been 
channelled into the various cost centres, they must be apportioned from service cost
centres over production cost centres. The essential features remain the same, namely
that the method chosen must be:
l fair to all parties involved in the process of apportionment;
l representative of the beneﬁt each party gains from the shared cost;
l relatively quick to apply so that provision of information is not delayed;
l understandable by all concerned.
Exhibit 18.4 sets out the titles of some service cost centres and gives examples of
some methods by which their costs could be apportioned over production cost centres.
18.4.3
Absorbing overhead costs into products
You have now reached the ﬁnal stage of the process where all the overhead costs 
are collected in the production cost centres, ready to be absorbed into products. 
The essential features, as before, are that the method must be:
l fair to all parties involved in the process of absorption;
l representative of the beneﬁt each party gains from the shared cost;
l relatively quick to apply so that provision of information is not delayed;
l understandable by all concerned.

To absorb a fair share of overhead into each product, the method must make use of
the best measure of work done on a product. The best measure is usually labour hours
or machine hours, depending on whether the production process is labour intensive
or machinery intensive.
Direct labour hours are frequently used because overhead cost is incurred when
people are working. The longer they work, the more overhead is incurred.
Sometimes direct labour hours are not the best measure of work performed. In a
machinery-intensive environment, machine hours may be preferred to labour hours as
a basis for absorbing overhead.
There are occasions when the direct labour hours worked on a job are not known
because they are not recorded. In such circumstances a cost per £ of direct labour could
be applied. This is acceptable but has a disadvantage in that a change in the labour rate
could affect the amount of labour cost and hence the allocation of overhead.
Where all products are identical, a cost per unit would be sufﬁcient. However, in a
job-costing system such identical products are unlikely.
In summary, four possible methods of absorbing overhead costs into products are:
1 cost per direct labour hour;
2 cost per machine hour;
3 cost per £ of labour cost;
4 cost per unit.
18.4.4
Illustration
This section provides an illustration of the allocation and apportionment of over-
head costs and shows how the overhead cost is absorbed into products. Kitchen 
Units Company assembles and ﬁnishes kitchen units to customers’ orders. Assembly
involves creating the basic units, while Finishing involves adding the laminated 
surfaces and interior ﬁttings as speciﬁed by the customer. The machinery and tools
required for the work are kept in working order by a Maintenance department. The
Assembly and Finishing departments are production departments because they both do
work on the product. The Maintenance department is a service department because it
helps the work of the production departments but does not deal directly with the
product. The illustration shows how the overhead costs of one month are allocated
and apportioned, and then absorbs the costs into Product S, a kitchen unit which
spends two hours in Assembly and three hours in Finishing. It follows the sequence
of Figure 18.3, earlier.
A calculation of an overhead cost rate might be set out as in Exhibit 18.5, which
shows a statement of overhead cost rate for an organisation having two produc-
tion cost centres, the Assembly Department and the Finishing Department, and one
service cost centre, the Maintenance Department. In Exhibit 18.8, the indirect costs
incurred by the business are set out in Table 18.1. These costs relate to some or all of
the three departments and must be shared among them on a fair basis. Table 18.2 sets 
out information about each department which will be helpful in this fair sharing. 
The remaining tables of Exhibit 18.5 show the sharing process, step by step.
Exhibit 18.5
Illustration of the calculation of an overhead cost rate
Table 18.1 sets out the indirect costs incurred by the business on behalf of all depart-
ments taken together. The costs must be apportioned (shared) over the departments
because there is insufficient information to permit allocation of costs as a whole. 
Table 18.2 sets out relevant information about each department which will be used in
the process of determining an overhead cost rate.

There are four steps in calculating the overhead cost to be allocated to each job.
Step 1: Apportioning costs over departments, using a suitable method for each cost
In Table 18.3, each of the cost items contained in Table 18.1 is shared across the three
departments on an appropriate basis chosen from Table 18.2.

Notes
*
The cost of indirect materials is likely to be dependent on direct materials so the proportions applied
in sharing out the indirect materials costs are 4:5. The direct materials are used only in Assembly
and Finishing, so the indirect materials will relate only to these two departments.
Exhibit 18.5 continued
s

Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting

†
The cost of indirect labour is likely to be dependent on the total number of employees working in
the organisation, so the proportions applied in sharing out the indirect labour costs are 10:25:5.
‡
Rent costs may be shared out on the basis of floor space occupied by each department, in the 
proportions 1:2:1.
§,¶ Insurance and depreciation may both be shared out by reference to the value of the machinery
used in each department, in the proportions 3:5:2.
Step 2: Apportioning service department costs to production departments on the 
basis of value of machines in each department
The maintenance department provides service in proportion to the machinery used in
each department, so it is appropriate to share out the maintenance costs on the basis
of value of machinery in Assembly and in Finishing, in the proportions 30,000:50,000:
× 5,970 = 2,239
× 5,970 = 3,731

Step 3: Absorbing total overhead costs of each production department into units 
produced during the period
Dividing the total cost of each department by the number of direct labour hours, we
obtain the following overhead cost rates:
Assembly:
£29,569/55,000 hours = 53.76 pence per direct labour hour
Finishing:
£51,031/64,000 hours = 79.74 pence per direct labour hour
Step 4: Finding the overhead costs of any job
Now the overhead cost rate may be used to determine how much overhead cost should
be absorbed by (charged to) each job. The answer will depend on the number of direct
labour hours required in each production department, for any job. Take as an example
job S, which spends two hours in the Assembly department and three hours in the
Finishing department. The overhead cost allocated to job S is calculated as follows:

That’s all there is to it. The process of allocation, apportionment and absorption 
of production overheads takes time because every cost has to be traced through to 
the product, but it is systematic in that all costs eventually ﬁnd their way through to 
a product.
Return to the start of Exhibit 18.5 and try to work the example for yourself. It is very
important for later chapters that you understand the purpose of Exhibit 18.5 and the
method of calculation used. There are some features of the tables in Exhibit 18.5 which
are worth noting for future reference. First, it is important to keep totals for each column
of figures and a total of all the column totals in order to ensure that there are no
arithmetic errors that result in costs appearing from nowhere or disappearing to oblivion.
Second, it is important to show working notes at all times because there are so many
variations of possible method that the person who reads your calculations will need the
working notes to understand the method chosen.
18.4.5
Predetermined overhead cost rates
This chapter has explained methods by which actual overhead cost for a period may
be absorbed into jobs. However, the calculation of overhead cost rates based on the
actual overhead costs incurred during the period means that job cost calculations have
to be postponed until the end of the period, because the overhead cost cannot be
obtained before that time. This creates practical problems where timely information on
job costs is essential if it is to be used for estimating the value of work in progress or
calculating monthly proﬁt. As a result of this demand for information before the actual
costs are known, many businesses will use predetermined overhead cost rates, esti-
mated before the start of a reporting period. This rate will then be applied to all output
of the period. At the end of the period, when the actual overhead is known, there 
will be an adjustment to bring the estimated overhead cost into line with the actual
overhead cost.
Estimating the predetermined overhead rate
How does a manager make the estimate of the predetermined overhead cost rate? 
It could be based on the known overhead costs of previous periods. It could be a ‘best
guess’ of what will happen in the forecast period. The predetermined overhead cost
rate is then applied to the output of the period. This is also described as overhead cost
recovery because the cost will be ‘recovered’ when the output is completed and sold.
Estimates abound in accounting and part of the reporting process involves explain-
ing why the actual out-turn did, or did not, match up to the estimate. Chapter 23 will
introduce the techniques of standard costing and variance analysis, which provide a
formal means of analysing and investigating differences between estimated and actual
amounts. Provided the estimation process is carried out with care, the beneﬁts of using
predetermined overhead costs, in terms of having information early rather than late,
by far outweigh the possible negative aspects of having to explain differences between
estimated and actual overhead costs charged to products.
Exhibit 18.6 gives the information necessary to calculate a predetermined overhead
cost rate. The steps of the calculation are then described.

Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
500
Step 1
The accounting period is one month. Before the start of the month, the manager esti-
mates that there will be 10,000 labour hours worked, under normal activity conditions,
and that ﬁxed overhead of £50,000 will be incurred.
Step 2
The manager calculates the predetermined ﬁxed overhead cost rate as £5 per labour
hour (= £50,000/10,000).
Step 3
Throughout the reporting period, as work is done, the manager applies £5 of ﬁxed
overhead for every labour hour of each item of output from the business. If exactly
10,000 hours of work are carried out then each item of output will carry its fair share
of the overhead. The process of overhead cost recovery is complete.
18.4.6
Under-recovery and over-recovery of overheads
The calculations of overhead cost recovery are not always as neat and tidy as in 
section 18.4.5. This section explains how under-recovery and over-recovery can occur.
Under-recovered overhead: underestimating hours worked
Supposing things do not work out as planned in section 18.4.5. The manager ﬁnds out
at the end of the month that only 8,000 hours were actually worked. In Step 3, ﬁxed
overhead of £5 will be charged to jobs for each hour worked, so £40,000 will be
charged in total. We can also say that there is recovery of £40,000. At the end of the
month the manager conﬁrms that the cash book shows the actual overhead cost
incurred is £50,000, corresponding exactly to the estimated amount. The manager has
a total ﬁxed overhead cost of £40,000 recovered (charged to jobs) but an actual cost 
of £50,000 as an expense for the ﬁnancial proﬁt and loss account. The ﬁxed overhead
cost recorded on the job records is said to be under-recovered. In the management
accounting proﬁt and loss account the ﬁxed overhead element of the cost of goods sold
is recorded at £40,000 using the predetermined rate, and a separate cost of £10,000 is
recorded as under-recovered fixed overhead, so that the total ﬁxed overhead expense
of the month equals £50,000.
Under-recovered overhead: underestimating overhead cost
Suppose that the actual hours worked do match the expected hours, so that in Step 3
there is recovery of the full amount of £50,000 (based on 10,000 hours at £5 per hour).
However, when the manager checks the cash book, it shows that the actual overhead
cost of the month is £55,000 due to an unforeseen rise in ﬁxed service charges. The
ﬁxed overhead cost recorded on the job records is again said to be under-recovered.
In the management accounting proﬁt and loss account the ﬁxed overhead element 
of the cost of goods sold is recorded at £50,000 using the predetermined rate, and a
separate cost of £5,000 is recorded as under-recovered fixed overhead, so that the total
ﬁxed overhead expense of the month equals £55,000.
Definition
Under-recovered fixed overhead occurs when the overhead cost recovered (applied),
using a predetermined overhead cost rate, is less than the actual overhead cost of the
period. This may be because the actual hours worked are less than the estimate made 
in advance, or it may be because the actual overhead cost incurred is greater than the
estimate of the overhead cost.

Chapter 18 Product costs: materials, labour and overheads
501
Over-recovered overhead: underestimating hours worked
Now suppose an alternative picture. The manager ﬁnds out at the end of the month
that 11,000 hours were actually worked. In Step 3, ﬁxed overhead of £5 will be charged
to jobs for each hour worked, so £55,000 will be charged in total. We can also say that
there is recovery of £55,000. At the end of the month the manager also conﬁrms that
the cash book shows the actual overhead cost incurred is £50,000, corresponding
exactly to the estimated amount. The manager has a total ﬁxed overhead cost of £55,000
recovered (charged to jobs) but an actual cost of £50,000 as an expense for the ﬁnancial
proﬁt and loss account. The ﬁxed overhead cost recorded on the job records is said to
be over-recovered. In the management accounting proﬁt and loss account the ﬁxed
overhead element of the cost of goods sold is recorded at £55,000 using the predeter-
mined rate, and a separate reduction in cost of £5,000 is recorded as over-recovered
fixed overhead, so that the total ﬁxed overhead expense of the month equals £50,000.
Over-recovered overhead: overestimating overhead cost
Suppose that the actual hours worked do match the expected hours, so that in Step 3
there is recovery of the full amount of £50,000 (based on 10,000 hours at £5 per hour).
However, when the manager checks the cash book, it shows that the actual overhead
cost of the month is £48,000 due to an unexpected rebate of charges for heating. The
ﬁxed overhead cost recorded on the job records is again said to be over-recovered. In
the management accounting proﬁt and loss account the ﬁxed overhead element of the
cost of goods sold is recorded at £50,000 using the predetermined rate, and a separate
reduction in cost of £2,000 is recorded as over-recovered fixed overhead, so that the
total ﬁxed overhead expense of the month equals £48,000.
Definition
Over-recovered fixed overhead occurs when the overhead recovered (applied), using a
predetermined overhead cost rate, is greater than the actual overhead cost of the period.
This may be because the actual hours worked are greater than the estimate made in
advance, or it may be because the actual overhead cost incurred is less than the
estimate of the overhead cost.
Effect on profit
If there is over-recovered fixed overhead then too much cost is charged in the man-
agement accounts, when compared to the actual cost incurred. The management
accounting proﬁt will be too low. To restore the proﬁt to the actual level achieved, the
over-recovery must be deducted from the cost charged.
If there is under-recovered fixed overhead then too little cost is charged in the man-
agement accounts, when compared to the actual cost incurred. The management
accounting proﬁt will be too high. To restore the proﬁt to the actual level achieved, the
under-recovery must be added to the cost charged.
18.4.7
More questions about overhead cost rates
Overhead cost is one of those topics which make you want to ask a new question every
time you have an answer to the previous question. Here are some of the questions
which might have occurred to you in thinking about overhead cost rates:
l Is it necessary to have an overhead cost rate for each cost centre or could there be
one rate to cover all production?
l How is it possible to calculate an overhead cost rate per direct labour hour for ﬁxed
overhead costs, when these do not vary with direct labour hours?
l What is the best way of ensuring that the process of allocation, apportionment and
absorption of costs most closely represents the behaviour of those costs?

Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
502
The answers to all these questions will be found in thinking about the four conditions
for determining a suitable overhead cost rate:
1 fair to all parties involved in the process;
2 representative of the beneﬁt each party gains from the shared cost;
3 relatively quick to apply so that provision of information is not delayed;
4 understandable by all concerned.
The answers are therefore as follows.
Is it necessary to have an overhead cost rate for each cost centre or could
there be one rate to cover all production?
If there is a wide product range and products spend different amounts of time in dif-
ferent cost centres, it would be undesirable to have one rate to cover all production
because that single rate would average out the time spent in the different departments.
Thus it is said that ‘blanket overhead cost rates’ or ‘plant-wide rates’ should be avoided
where possible, or used with great caution. The overhead cost rate to use will be one
which can be used with conﬁdence that it meets the four conditions stated earlier.
How is it possible to calculate an overhead cost rate per direct labour hour
for fixed overhead costs when, by definition, fixed costs do not vary with
direct labour hours?
This question is more difﬁcult to answer and the best starting point is a reminder 
that accounting is often based on estimates. The ﬁxed overhead costs will have to be
absorbed into products eventually. However, this can only be achieved accurately
after production is completed. Job cost estimation cannot always wait that long.
Therefore, a predetermined ﬁxed overhead cost rate is applied to each job on the basis
of some measure of work done, such as direct labour hours. If the estimating process
is accurate, the estimated hours to be worked will equal the actual hours worked and
there will be no problem. If the actual hours are greater than, or less than, the estimate,
then there will be a difference, referred to as overapplied or underapplied ﬁxed over-
head. Exhibit 18.6 has set out an illustration of underapplied ﬁxed overhead.
What is the best way of ensuring that the process of absorbing costs into
products most closely represents the behaviour of those costs?
This question has aroused considerable excitement in management accounting circles
in recent years, as some thinking people realised that too much time had been spent
in reading books and theorising. Researchers had omitted to ﬁnd out whether the
actual practice of management accounting was so bad after all. They therefore went
out to look, and found that some practical management accountants were having
some very good ideas but that those ideas were not ﬁnding their way into books.
As a result of those investigations, many articles and books have been written on
the importance of cost drivers, which are the events that are signiﬁcant determinants 
of the cost of an activity. If an oil company has an offshore platform where the super-
visor is constantly calling up the helicopter for unplanned visits ashore, the total trans-
port cost for the oil company will rise. The helicopter ﬂight is the cost driver and the
platform supervisor needs to be aware that the ﬂight cost is part of the cost of running
the platform. If a stores department is receiving frequent deliveries of small quantities,
the cost driver for the stores department is the number of deliveries. Cost drivers 
are not an earth-shattering discovery in themselves, but they have been built into a
description of activity-based costing (ABC) which you will ﬁnd in section 18.5. Activity-
based costing has led many companies to re-examine their approach to allocating
overhead costs to products, based on ﬁnding a method which most closely models the
factors driving the cost.

Chapter 18 Product costs: materials, labour and overheads
503
18.5 Activity-based costing (ABC) for production overheads
ABC is a relatively new approach to assigning overhead costs to products. The 
proponents of the subject claim that ABC provides product cost information which 
is useful for decision making. The claims of ABC will be explored in this chapter by
outlining the principles and then examining a case study.
Definition
Activity-based costing (ABC) traces overhead costs to products by focusing on the
activities that drive costs (cause costs to occur).
There are ﬁve stages to establishing an activity-based costing system. These are:
1 Identify the major activities which take place in an organisation.
2 Identify the factors which most closely inﬂuence the cost of an activity. These 
factors are called the cost drivers and are a direct indication of how the activity
demands cost.
3 Create a cost pool for each activity and trace costs to cost pools.
4 Calculate a cost driver rate as the total costs in a cost pool divided by the number
of times that the activity occurs.
5 Allocate costs to products using the demand for each activity.
See Figure 18.4 which shows the costs ﬂowing through cost pools to the product.
18.5.1
Reasons for the development of ABC2
In the 1980s Professors Cooper and Kaplan in the USA found the focus on activities
and cost drivers in some large US manufacturing businesses which had become dis-
satisﬁed with the traditional approach to overhead costing. Cooper and Kaplan wrote
up their observations as case studies at Harvard University and then published papers
Figure 18.4

on their ﬁndings. The cause of change was that business organisations were changing
their nature at the time, with an increase in indirect costs related to changes in pro-
cesses, new ways of dealing with customers and new investment in more sophisticated
operating systems. There was a swing from variable to ﬁxed overhead costs. Labour
resources were replaced to some extent by automation. It became apparent that produc-
tion volumes were no longer the main drivers of overhead costs. Organisations were
looking for a costing system that would be more realistic in tracking the consumption
of resources that gives rise to cost.
18.5.2
Nature of an activity
An activity, in its broadest sense, is something which happens in the business. An
activity could be using materials to make a physical product or using labour to carry out
a service operation. In ABC language, that would be an example of a unit activity, which
is performed each time a product is produced. Other activities are performed to enable
output of products but are not so closely dependent on how many units are produced.
These are called product-sustaining activities. Examples would be product design,
product testing and marketing. Some activities are classiﬁed as batch-related activities
which are ﬁxed for a given batch of products. This would include costs of the buying
department, costs of moving stores from the warehouse to the factory ﬂoor, and costs
of planning a production schedule. Where there are expenses such as rent or insurance
which are not driven by making products, they are designated as facility-sustaining
activities and no attempt is made to allocate these to products. They are charged as a total
cost against all products after the separate proﬁt margins on each product are determined.
Example 1
A language college teaches English as a Foreign Language. It has two departments: E
(European mother tongue) and A (Asian mother tongue). Information about each is
shown in Exhibit 18.7. The overhead cost of cleaning rooms is £32,000 per year.
The traditional method of allocating cleaning overhead cost to departments has
been to apply a rate of 2% of the labour cost of teaching. This is shown in Exhibit 18.8.
The head tutor of Department A feels this is unfair because it has fewer classrooms
than Department E and so requires less cleaning effort.
Assume that cleaning cost may be regarded as a cost pool and show how activity-
based costing can be applied where the number of classrooms is the cost driver for
cleaning.
The apportionment of cost by the activity-based method is shown in Exhibit 18.9.

Comment. The head of Department A will be happier with the use of activity-based
costing because it reﬂects the lower usage of cleaning driven by fewer classrooms. On
the other hand, it may be that this is not the best cost driver. For instance, suppose that
the head of Department E responds by pointing out that their classrooms are kept tidy
and are therefore easier to clean. The debate over cost drivers might take some time
to resolve.
Example 2
In the ofﬁce of a ﬁrm of solicitors and estate agents there are overhead costs incurred
relating to the cost of ofﬁce support for the staff preparing legal documentation. There
are two departments preparing legal documentation. Department A has dealt with 15
property transactions having an average value of £100,000 each, while Department B
has dealt with 5 property transactions having an average value of £1m each.
The total amount of the ofﬁce overhead costs for the period is £100,000. The traditional
approach to overhead cost has been to apportion the amount of £100,000 in pro-
portion to the number of property deals dealt with by each department. They are now
asking for an activity-based approach to costing, where the cost driver is the value of
transactions in each department, because high-value transactions involve more work.
The traditional approach (see Exhibit 18.10) gives the same unit cost regardless of
size of transaction.
Comment. The activity-based approach (see Exhibit 18.11) puts much more of the over-
head cost on to Department B because that one is driving more of the overheads.
When the cost per transaction is calculated, the activity-based approach, based on
value, loads the cost towards the high-value transaction and so produces a relatively
higher cost per unit for these transactions.

18.5.3
Role of the management accountant
Activity-based costing allows the attention-directing functions of the management
accountant to come to the fore. The management accountant takes a key role in under-
standing the operation of the business and translating into cost terms the activities as
perceived by those who carry them out.
Because activity-based costing requires a very thorough analysis of how products
drive the costs of various activities, it is not feasible to work through a full illustration
here. Instead, one activity, that of purchasing materials for use in a hotel restaurant,
will be explored by case study in some detail. Hopefully, that will give you a ﬂavour
of the complexity and fascination of ABC and encourage you to read further.
18.5.4
Case study: Glen Lyon Hotel
The Glen Lyon Hotel has two main product lines, with quite different characteristics.
In the restaurant, meals are provided on a daily basis to the chef’s high standards of
perfection. In the conference suite, banquets are arranged for special functions such as
weddings. There is a restaurant manager, responsible for restaurant meals, and a func-
tions manager, responsible for banquets. The hotel seeks to offer competitive prices
subject to meeting all costs and earning an adequate proﬁt.
The hotel has a purchasing department which purchases the food required by the
hotel restaurant and all supplies required for special functions, including crockery and
cutlery. The purchasing ofﬁcer is concerned that the restaurant manager insists on
buying food in relatively small quantities, because the chef is very particular about
monitoring the continued high quality of supplies. The functions manager also creates
problems for the purchasing department because she insists on buying crockery and
cutlery in bulk, to save cost, which requires time being taken by the purchasing ofﬁcer
to negotiate the best terms with the supplier. Even the suppliers can create a great deal
of work because they are constantly changing their prices and this has to be recorded
on the computer system of the purchasing department. The purchasing ofﬁcer would
like to show that these activities are all costly because they drive the amount of work
undertaken by the purchasing department.
Fiona McTaggart was called in to help, and she now explains how she went about
the task of applying activity-based costing in relation to the activities of the purchas-
ing department.
FIONA: First of all I asked for a list of all the costs incurred by the department in a year (see
Exhibit 18.12).
Identifying the cost drivers
Then I sat down with the purchasing officer for a long meeting during which we talked
about how the purchasing process worked. From those discussions I found that a number
of activities were driving the work of purchasing and I listed all those (see Exhibit 18.13).

I explained to the purchasing officer that, although the purchasing department was an
identifiable unit of the organisation for staff management purposes, it would no longer 
be treated as a cost centre under activity-based costing. The purchasing process would 
be regarded as a set of activities consuming ‘resources’ such as salaries, wages and tele-
phone calls. Each activity would collect a ‘pool’ of cost as the resources were used up. The
pool of costs would be passed on to those other departments drawing on the services of
the purchasing department and from those departments the costs would find their way into
products.
Creating the cost pools
The next stage was to decide how much of each resource cost was attributable to the
activity driving that cost. This part was quite tricky because the purchasing officer only had
a ‘feel’ for the relative impact in some cases. Take as an example the processing of an
order. When the restaurant manager asks for food to be ordered, the purchasing officer
first has to phone the supplier to check availability and likely delivery time. Then she checks
that someone will be available to open the cold store when the delivery arrives. She is then
able to fax the order to the supplier who will phone back to confirm that the goods are
available and that delivery will be as requested. Once the goods arrive, the purchasing 
officer has to check that the delivery note agrees with what was ordered. That whole 
process takes about 20 minutes for each order.
We carried on talking and I was able to identify, for each resource cost, some measure
of how the activity was being driven. The starting point was salaries. We estimated that the
purchasing officer spent the equivalent of two days per week agreeing terms with suppliers.
The remaining three days were divided equally over the other activities listed. The data 
processing clerk spent three days per week in processing orders, half a day each week 
on updating price lists and updating suppliers’ records, and one day per week on checking
and processing questions from the accounts department about invoices received for pay-
ment. The final cost heading was telephone calls. The destination and duration of each call
is logged by the telephone system so we took a sample of one week’s calls and decided
that 60% of telephone calls were routine calls to place an order, 20% were dealing with
queries over price changes and the remainder were spread equally over agreeing terms,
updating the supplier records and dealing with invoice queries. Following these dis-
cussions I sketched a diagram of the ABC approach (see Figure 18.5) and then drew up a
table showing how each cost item could be allocated to the various activities so that a cost
pool is created for each activity (see Exhibit 18.14).
Demand for each activity
The next stage was to determine how many times each activity driver was put into action.
This involved measuring the volume of each activity, as a measure of the demand for that
activity. Agreeing terms with the supplier is not easy to quantify, but we were aware that
there are discussions with each supplier at some time during the year, so we took the 
number of suppliers as the measure of volume driving that activity. It was relatively easy to
establish the number of orders processed at the request of the restaurant manager.

Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
508
The price list has to be updated every time the supplier changes the price of any items, and
they all change at least twice per month, so we decided that the number of items on the
order list was a reasonable measure. Updating supplier records involves changing minor
details for existing suppliers but takes more time to record a new supplier. So we used the
number of new suppliers as the measure of the volume of that activity. Processing invoice
queries depends on the number of such queries.
Cost driver rates
My final accounting statement was a calculation of the cost per activity unit for each activ-
ity (see Exhibit 18.15). This was determined by dividing the cost in the pool by the measure
of how that activity was being driven by products.
Using the calculation of cost per activity unit for each activity I was able to explain the
benefits of activity-based costing. The purchasing department is providing a service to 
the rest of the organisation, but at a cost. That cost could be made more visible using 
activity-based costing because the factors driving the cost could be quantified in their
effect. Looking at Exhibit 18.15, it is not difficult to see that the most significant cost 
drivers are the activities of agreeing terms with suppliers and of updating the suppliers’
records. Each new supplier causes a further £159.166 (£103.333 + £55.833) to be incurred

at an early stage. The restaurant manager needs to be aware that placing large numbers 
of low-volume orders causes cost to be incurred on each order. The total cost incurred
could be reduced by moving to a lower number of orders, each being of higher volume.
(Someone would need to check that that did not create larger new costs in storage of 
the goods.) The next most costly activity, in terms of cost per unit, is that of answering
queries about invoices. The accounts department should be made aware that each enquiry
costs £28.333.
I also looked back to the old way of allocating the cost of the purchasing depart-
ment (see Exhibit 18.16). Before activity-based costing was considered, the organisation
charged the purchasing costs to products as a percentage of the value of materials
ordered. Looking back to Exhibit 18.14, the total purchasing department costs are shown
as £27,000. The purchasing department handles goods to the value of £800,000 in a year.
The purchasing department costs were therefore charged to products at 3.375% of cost.
Why was this not the best approach? The answer is that there were two main product lines,
having quite different characteristics. One was restaurant meals provided on a routine
basis and the other was special banquets for functions such as weddings. My further
enquiries revealed that the high-price purchases required for special functions caused 
relatively few problems in agreeing terms with suppliers and relatively few queries arose
over the invoices. Where problems of negotiation and invoicing did arise was in the

low-price, high-volume ingredients used routinely in the dining room meals. The infor-
mation on cost per unit of each activity allowed a much more precise allocation of cost,
although I was now in for even more work in tracing the costs from the various activity
pools through to the products.
Tracing costs through to products
To trace costs through to products I obtained estimates of the quantity of each activity
demanded by the restaurant manager and the function manager (see Exhibit 18.17) and
multiplied each quantity by the cost per activity unit calculated in Exhibit 18.15. The result
is shown in Exhibit 18.18.
Compare this with the cost allocation under the traditional system which is shown in
Exhibit 18.16.
My conclusions were that the accounts department had previously been unaware of the
costs it was causing the purchasing manager whenever an invoice query was raised. Using
activity-based costing would allow the allocation of cost to the accounts department each
time a question was raised. Some care might need to be taken to examine the size and 
significance of the invoice query in relation to the cost allocation. It would not be a good
idea for the accounts department to allow a £50,000 error to go unchecked because they
feared a charge of £28.33. The implementation of activity-based costing might need to be
accompanied by the use of performance measures which show how the benefits of an
activity exceed the costs incurred.

Activity 18.5
Chapter 18 Product costs: materials, labour and overheads
511
The functions manager would incur less overhead cost under the activity-based system
than under the previous approach. The recorded cost of functions would therefore
decrease. As I explained earlier, the high-priced purchases of food for special functions
cause relatively few problems in processing a smaller number of orders. The functions
manager seems to have a relatively high number of new suppliers. Cost could be con-
trolled further if fewer suppliers were used for functions. Less purchasing effort would 
be required.
The restaurant manager experiences little difference in cost under either approach. 
To improve overhead costs there would need to be a quantum leap in practice, such as
reducing the order frequency to the stage where one less person was employed in the 
purchasing department, or else where a part-time employee could do the work presently
undertaken full-time. Merely reducing the order frequency would not be enough if the 
purchasing staff are still present full-time and the same cost is being spread over a lower
volume of activity. Although there is little impact, these figures give the restaurant manager
food for thought.
Product costs
In the full application of ABC, the costs would be taken into the final product cost. I have
not done that here because the purchasing department’s costs are only one small corner
of the total business. Activity-based costing creates a lot of work, but a well-coded com-
puterised accounting system can handle that. I spent the best part of one day dealing 
only with the analysis of the purchasing department costs, so it would take a few weeks 
of consultancy to cover the entire range of activities which contribute to the cost of the
products. My consultancy fees would be another overhead to be allocated, but I believe
the hotel would find the effort well worth it in terms of more effective management over a
period of years.
Imagine you are the owner of a business which rents ice-cream stalls from the local
council. You employ people to run each stall. Write down a list of the costs you would
expect to incur. Write another list of the drivers of cost. How could activity-based costing
help you understand and control the costs of your business?
18.6 Comparing the traditional approach and ABC
18.6.1
Contrasting treatments
Allocating direct costs to products is not a problem. The particular need for activity-
based costing lies in the area of absorbing overhead costs into products. The traditional
approach to absorbing overhead costs to products was explained in section 18.4. 
In that section it was shown that, traditionally, costs are ﬁrst allocated and apportioned
to cost centres and then absorbed into products which pass through those cost centres.
Activity-based costing follows a different approach to channelling costs towards 
products. Exhibit 18.19 sets out the contrasting treatments.
18.6.2
Benefits claimed for activity-based costing
Activity-based costing appeared ﬁrst in the academic literature during the late 1980s.
It had reached the professional accountancy journals by the early 1990s and by that
time was already being used (or tested) by companies with progressive attitudes. The
main beneﬁts claimed are that it provides product cost information which, although it

Part 5 Setting the scene and defining the basic tools of management accounting
512
includes an allocation of overheads, is nevertheless useful for decision-making pur-
poses. It is useful because the overhead costs are allocated to the products in a way
that reﬂects the factor driving the cost. If a product cost is thought to be too high, then
it can be controlled by controlling the factors driving the most signiﬁcant elements of
its cost. Attention is directed towards problem areas. Activity-based costing is seen as
a valuable management tool because it collects and reports on the signiﬁcant activities
of the business. It is also attractive for service-based organisations which have found
the traditional, manufacturing-based costing methods not suited to the different nature
of the service sector.
You may ask at this point, ‘If activity-based costing is the best approach, why has it
not replaced the traditional approach to overhead cost apportionment?’ The answer to
that question is, ﬁrst, that the technique is still relatively rare in practical application,
despite the amount written about it. Second, no allocating mechanism can produce
accurate results unless the cost item which is being processed is of high reliability and
its behaviour is well understood. The successful application of activity-based costing
depends on a thorough understanding of basic principles of cost behaviour and the
ability to record and process costs accurately.
Activity-based costing will not solve all problems of forward planning. The ana-
lytical method relies on historical data and therefore shares with many other aspects
of accounting the disadvantage of being a backward-looking measure which must be
used with caution in forward-looking decisions.
Finally, activity-based costing requires detailed accounting records and a well-
structured cost-coding system so that costs are allocated correctly to cost pools and
from there to products. There may need to be a considerable investment in discovering
and installing the best information system for the job.
Activity-based costing
Identify the way in which products drive the
activity of the business and define suitable
cost pools for collecting the costs relating
to each activity. Activity cost pools are
determined by the activities which drive 
the costs (e.g. obtaining new customers,
negotiating customer contracts).
Collect costs in activity cost pools.
Determine a cost driver rate for each
activity cost pool (e.g. a cost per customer
contract, cost per customer order received).
Allocate cost to products according to 
the product’s demand for the activity which
drives cost.
Exhibit 18.19
Contrasting activity-based costing and traditional overhead cost allocation
Traditional overhead cost allocation
Identify cost centres in which costs 
may be accumulated. Cost centres are 
determined by the nature of their function 
(e.g. production or service department 
cost centres).
Collect costs in cost centres.
Determine an overhead cost rate for each 
production cost centre (e.g. cost per 
direct labour hour).
Allocate cost to products using the 
calculated cost rate and the measure of the 
product’s consumption of that department’s 
cost (e.g. number of labour hours required).

18.7 Summary
Key themes in this chapter are:
l Total product cost is deﬁned as consisting of direct materials, direct labour and 
production overhead cost.
l Prime cost is the cost of direct materials, direct labour and other direct costs of 
production.
l The purchasing, storage and use of materials are controlled by documentation and
processes that are designed to safeguard the assets and ensure the accuracy of
recording systems.
l FIFO (ﬁrst in ﬁrst out) and LIFO (last in ﬁrst out) are methods of pricing the issue
of goods from inventory, and the valuation of inventory, in times when prices are
changing.
l Accounting for materials is explained, highlighting the importance of documen-
tation, the distinction between direct and indirect costs of materials and between
fixed and variable costs of materials.
l The costs of waste and scrap are indirect costs that form part of the total produc-
tion cost. Any cash received for scrap should be deducted from the cost of buying
the materials.
l Labour costs are recorded and controlled in a way that ensures employees are paid
correctly for work done and labour costs of activities are recorded accurately.
l Accounting for labour costs is explained, highlighting the distinction between
direct and indirect labour costs and between fixed and variable costs of labour.
l Total product cost is deﬁned as consisting of direct materials, direct labour and
production overhead cost.
l Production overhead costs comprise indirect materials, indirect labour and other
indirect costs of production.
l Allocation of indirect costs to cost centres means that the entire cost item is
identiﬁed with one cost centre.
l Apportionment of indirect costs across cost centres means that the cost item is
shared across those cost centres on some basis which is a fair representation of how
the cost item is used by each cost centre.
l Absorption is the process by which overhead costs are absorbed into units of 
output, or ‘jobs’.
l The processes of apportionment and absorption are said to be arbitrary (meaning 
‘a matter of choice rather than of strict rules’). To ensure that the best result is
obtained, the scheme of apportionment and absorption must be:
– fair to all parties involved in the process
– representative of the beneﬁt each party gains from the shared cost
– relatively quick to apply so that the provision of information is not delayed; and
understandable by all concerned.
l The sequence of allocate, apportion and absorb is called the traditional approach to
product costing.
l activity-based costing (ABC) traces overhead costs to products by focusing on the
activities that drive costs (cause costs to occur).
l activity-based costing provides a method of spreading overhead costs by asking:
what drives each cost?

machine hours worked. Were overheads under-absorbed or over-absorbed, and by how much?

C
Problem solving and evaluation
C18.1
In a general engineering works the following routine has been followed for several years to arrive
at an estimate of the price for a contract.
The process of estimating is started by referring to a job cost card for some previous 
similar job and evaluating the actual material and direct labour hours used on that job at 
current prices and rates.
Production overheads are calculated and applied as a percentage of direct wages. The 
percentage is derived from figures appearing in the accounts of the previous year, using the
total production overhead cost divided by the total direct wages cost.
One-third is added to the total production overhead cost to cover administrative charges 
and profit.
You have been asked to draft a short report to management outlining, with reasons, the
changes which you consider desirable in order to improve the process of estimating a price for
a contract.
C18.2
You have been asked for advice by the owner of a small business who has previously estimated
overhead costs as a percentage of direct labour cost. This method has produced quite 
reasonable results because the products have all been of similar sales value and have required 
similar labour inputs. The business has now changed and will in future concentrate on two 
products. Product X is a high-volume item of relatively low sales value and requires relatively
little labour input per item. It is largely produced by automatic processes. Product Y is a low-
volume item of relatively high sales value and requires considerably more labour input by 
specially skilled workers. It is largely produced by manual craft processes.
What advice would you give to the owner of the business about allocation of overhead costs
comprising:
l the owner’s salary for administrative work;
l rent paid on the production facilities; and
l depreciation of production machinery?
Compare the effect of having one overhead recovery rate for all three costs in aggregate, and
the effect of identifying the factors which ‘drive’ each cost in relation to the production process.
Activities for study groups
Case 18.1
As a group you are the senior teaching staff of a school where each subject department is
regarded as a cost centre. The direct costs of each cost centre are teachers’ salaries, books
and worksheets for pupils. The overhead costs of the school administration are charged to each
cost centre as a fixed percentage of teachers’ salaries in the cost centre. The languages depart-
ment argues that this is unfair to them as they have a higher ratio of teachers to pupils due to
the need for developing spoken language skills. The art department objects to the percentage
charge because it includes accommodation costs without recognising that they are housed 
in portacabins where the roof leaks. The maths department says that they should not have to
share the costs of expensive technical equipment when all they need for effective teaching is 
a piece of chalk. One member of staff has read about ‘cost drivers’ and the teachers have
decided that they would like to meet the school accountant to put forward some ideas about
using cost drivers. So far they have made a list of the main overhead costs as:
l heating and lighting
l head teacher, deputy heads and office staff salaries
l cleaning
l maintenance

l library
l computing services for staff
l computing labs for pupils
l insurance of buildings and contents.
Allocate among your group the roles of staff in the languages, art and maths departments.
Discuss cost drivers for each of the overhead costs listed and attempt to arrive at an agreement
on cost drivers to be presented to the school accountant. What are the problems of agreeing
the drivers? What are the benefits?
Case 18.2
Two bus companies are competing for passengers on the most popular routes in a major city.
The long-established company has strong customer loyalty, provides weekend and evening
services as well as frequent daytime services and covers the cost of unprofitable routes from
the profits on popular routes. The incoming company has larger resources from which to 
support a price war and can be selective in running only at peak times on the most popular
routes. There are fears that if the incomer wins the bus war, the quality of service provision 
will diminish in the evenings and at weekends and on unprofitable routes.
As a group allocate the roles of: (a) passenger representatives, (b) the financial controller’s
department of the long-established company, (c) members of the city council’s transport com-
mittee, (d) representatives of the police force. In the separate roles discuss the areas where cost
savings might be achieved by the long-established company to make it competitive on price.
Then come together and negotiate a support package for the company which focuses on
improving the financial performance of the company.

REAL WORLD CASE
This case study shows a typical situation in which management accounting can be helpful. Read the case
study now, but only attempt the discussion points after you have finished studying the chapter.
The following advice is provided on a US-based website
that gives advice to those intending to start a cake baking
business.
How much should I charge for my cake? I have
read that a good way to price cakes is to charge
for the cost of ingredients times 2 (or 3).
We firmly believe that the ‘ingredients times 2 or 3’ method 
of pricing is arbitrary and not rooted in any kind of business
theory. In our experience, this method results in grossly
underpricing your product. The cost of the cake lies not in 
the ingredients, but in the labour invested.
To price your cakes, there are four elements to
be aware of:
The first element: Ingredients and supplies
To know how much to charge, you must understand how
much you are spending. It takes a time investment to calculate your ingredient costs, but it is vital to
understanding what a cake costs you to make. Don’t forget the cost of the boards, boxes, foil, and dowels.
The second element: Time
When you start thinking about it, the time you spend on a cake is so much more than just the time spent
decorating. There is time spent consulting with the customer, planning a custom design, shopping, baking,
cooling, making fillings, frostings, fondant, and sometimes custom work like fondant or gumpaste toppers or
figurines. You deserve to be compensated a fair hourly rate for the time you spend on a cake. Don’t forget cleanup
time! We’ve all seen what our kitchens look like after a big cake!
The third element: Overhead
When you bake a cake, you use your oven, your utilities, your pans, your mixer, your dishwasher, and soap. These
things all required an initial investment by you, and a nominal fee for their use should be added to the cost of the cake.
The fourth element: Delivery
Your customer lives two hours away and wants the cake delivered? Then you must certainly be compensated for
your time, your gas, wear and tear on your vehicle, and any tolls that are incurred on the trip. The current federal
reimbursement rate for mileage is 58.5 cents per mile, so this is a good place to start. Remember to charge for the
entire round-trip!

Discussion points
1
Why is a job-costing approach suitable for estimating the cost of baking specialist cakes to meet customers’ wishes.
2
Why does the website advise against applying a multiple to ‘cost of ingredients’?

19.1 Introduction
In Chapter 18 direct materials, direct labour and production overheads were explained.
This chapter brings together the elements of a job-costing system and explains the
procedures for analysing them to calculate the cost of a job undertaken during a period
of time. In a job-costing system there will be a job-cost record for each job, showing the
costs incurred on that job. A job-cost record is illustrated in Table 19.1. The transactions
of the period are analysed and recorded using the accounting equation.
A job-costing system for recording the cost of output is appropriate to a busi-
ness which provides specialised products or makes items to order, so that each 
customer’s requirements constitute a separate job of work. Job costing is appropriate

in manufacturing industries such as shipbuilding, bridge building, construction, 
property development and craft industries. Job costing would also be used in cost-
ing the provision of services by professional persons such as lawyers, doctors, 
architects and accountants. It could also be used for repair contracts, or specialist 
service contracts.
Definition
A job-costing system is a system of cost accumulation where there is an identifiable
activity for which costs may be collected. The activity is usually specified in terms of 
a job of work or a group of tasks contributing to a stage in the production or service
process.
The job-cost record shows the costs of materials, labour and overhead incurred 
on a particular job. The accounts department knows from the stores requisition the
quantity of materials issued to production and knows from the invoice the price per
unit charged by the supplier. This allows the cost of direct materials to be recorded as
the materials are used. Each job will have a job number and that number will be
entered on all stores requisitions so that the materials can be traced to the job-cost
record.
Direct labour costs will be calculated using hours worked and the hourly rate for
each employee. The hours worked will be collected from employee time sheets which
show each job under its own job number. Hourly rates for the employee will be avail-
able from personnel records.

Other direct costs will be charged to jobs by entering on the expense invoice the
appropriate job number. The invoices will be used as the primary source from which
information is transferred to the job-cost record.
Production overhead costs will be shared among the jobs to which they relate, as
explained in Chapter 18.
You have been employed as the management accountant at a car repair garage. Write
down a list of the types of costs you would expect to find on a job-cost record for a car
service and repair. (You don’t need to put any money amounts into the list.)
Table 19.1 shows sufﬁcient details of direct materials, direct labour and other direct
costs to give the prime cost of production. Addition of indirect costs (production 
overhead) gives the total product cost of a job.
Definitions
Prime cost of production is equal to the total of direct materials, direct labour and other
direct costs.
Production overhead cost comprises indirect materials, indirect labour and other
indirect costs of production.
Total product cost comprises prime cost plus production overhead cost.
19.2 Job-cost records: an illustration
Job costing is illustrated in the example of Specialprint, a company which prints 
novelty stationery to be sold in a chain of retail stores. The company has only one 
customer for this novelty stationery. Table 19.2 contains relevant information for the
month of June in respect of three separate jobs, 601, 602 and 603. Symbols are 
attached to each transaction so that the information may be traced through the job-cost
records.
19.2.1
Information for the job-cost record
The job-cost record requires information on direct materials, direct labour and prod-
uction overhead. This information must be selected from the list of transactions for 
the month of June. Care must be taken to extract only that information which is 
relevant to each job.
From Table 19.2 note the transactions which you think are directly relevant to the cost of
jobs 601, 602 and 603. Then read the rest of this section and compare your answer with
the text. (Use Table 19.1 to remind yourself of the information needed for a job cost
record.)
Direct material
Materials are purchased on 1 June and taken into store but that is of no relevance to
determining the cost of a job. For job cost purposes what matters is the issue of paper
on 3 June. That is entered on each of the job-cost records using the detail given for the
event on 3 June.

Direct labour
Employees are paid during the month and there are records (time sheets) of the jobs
on which they work. It is only at the end of the month that the employee records are
checked to ﬁnd where the work was carried out. At that point the relevant direct
labour costs are entered on each job-cost record.
Production overhead
Production overhead comprises indirect materials (ink, glue and dyes), indirect
labour (maintenance wages), rent, rates and electricity.

An overhead cost rate is required to determine how much production overhead
should be absorbed into each job. We are told in Table 19.2 that it is company policy
to absorb production overheads in proportion to the direct labour costs of each job.
The total direct labour cost for the period is £16,000 and so the overhead cost rate must
be calculated as:
overhead cost rate (in £ per £ of direct labour) =
= £1.6875 per £
This rate is then applied to the amounts of direct labour cost already charged to
each job (which was £8,000 for job 601, £4,800 for job 602 and £3,200 for job 603). The
resulting amounts are recorded in the relevant job records.

Presentation of the job-cost records
The job-cost records are set out in Table 19.3. Jobs 601 and 602 are ﬁnished in the
period and this is shown on the job-cost record by a transfer to ﬁnished goods of 
the full cost of the job. Job 603 has a problem with unﬁnished work in progress but 
the rest of that job is completed and transferred to ﬁnished goods. That information is
recorded on the job-cost record card as shown in Table 19.3.
The total work in progress record is useful as a check on the separate job costs 
and is also useful for accounting purposes in providing a total record of work in
progress at any point in time. It is created by using the totals of the direct materials
issued to production, the total direct labour used on jobs and the total production
overhead incurred during the month. Table 19.4 shows the total work in progress
record.

19.3 Job costing: applying the accounting equation 
to transactions
The job-cost record cards used only a part of the information contained in Table 19.2.
All the transactions must be recorded for purposes of preparing ﬁnancial statements,
using the accounting equation as shown in Chapter 3. This section analyses the trans-
actions of Table 19.2 using the accounting equation and concludes with a spreadsheet
record of the transactions for the month. The symbols contained in Table 19.2 are used
throughout to help follow the cost trail.
In management accounting there is strong emphasis on the ﬂow of costs. This ﬂow
starts when materials, labour and other resources are either acquired on credit terms

or paid for immediately in cash (line A in Figure 19.1). The management accounting
records trace these credit transactions and cash payments through to separate records
for materials, labour, production overhead and the administration and selling costs
(line B). The separate records are then considered in more detail.
The materials record includes both direct and indirect materials. When the direct
materials are issued for use in production, a stores requisition note is produced and
this is the basis for transferring that amount of direct materials cost from the ma-
terials record to the work in progress record (line C). When the indirect materials are
issued for use in production a further stores requisition note is produced. This is the
basis for transferring that amount of indirect materials cost from the materials record
to the production overhead record.
Figure 19.1 
Flow of costs in a management accounting information system 

Part 6 Job costs and stock valuation
528
The labour cost (line B) record will include both direct and indirect labour. Direct
labour hours are recorded on a time sheet and calculation of the cost of these hours is
the basis for transferring that amount of direct labour cost from the labour cost record
to the work in progress record. Calculation of indirect labour cost is the basis for 
transferring that amount of indirect labour cost from the labour cost record to the 
production overhead record.
Some items of indirect cost, not involving either materials or labour, will be trans-
ferred from the bank payment record (such as payment of rent, electricity or gas). At
the end of the accounting period, probably each month, all the production overhead
of the period is transferred to the work in progress record.
Finally on line B there is the record of administration and selling costs. These are
not part of the cost of work in progress because they are not costs of production. At
the end of the accounting period the total of these costs is transferred to the work in
progress record.
When the work in progress (line C) is completed there is a transfer of cost to the
record for ﬁnished goods stock (line D). When the ﬁnished goods are sold there is a
transfer of the cost of those items to the proﬁt and loss account as cost of goods sold.
The proﬁt and loss account (line E) brings together the sales, cost of goods sold and
administration and selling costs in a calculation of proﬁt.

Converting raw materials into work in progress: 
direct materials
When the rolls of paper are issued from the stores to the printing department, they
become a part of the work in progress of that department. Since this work in progress
is expected to bring a beneﬁt to the enterprise in the form of cash ﬂows from sales
when it is eventually ﬁnished and sold, it meets the deﬁnition of an asset. There is an
increase in the asset of work in progress and a decrease in the stock of materials. (†)

Labour costs
There are two amounts of direct labour costs paid during the period in respect of 
the printing employees (ψϖ); and two amounts of indirect wages in respect of 
maintenance (λϕ).
In practice, it will only be after analysis of the labour records for the period that 
an accurate subdivision into direct and indirect costs may be made. Although it is
assumed here that all wages of printing employees are direct costs, it could be that
enforced idle time through equipment failure would create an indirect cost. Taking the
simpliﬁed illustration, the direct wages paid become a part of the prime cost of work
in progress while the indirect wages paid become part of the production overhead cost
within work in progress.
For the purposes of this illustration it is assumed that the manager of the business
knows that all printing employees’ wages are direct costs (♥) and so may be recorded
immediately as direct costs of work in progress. The asset of cash decreases and the
asset of work in progress increases.
Asset ↑↓−Liability = Ownership interest
It is further assumed that the manager of the business knows that all indirect 
labour costs will become production overheads (x) and hence added to the value of
work in progress.

Production overhead costs
Rent, rates and electricity costs (‡) paid from cash in respect of printing are production
overhead costs (ξ). For management accounting purposes they are regarded as part of
the cost of the asset of work in progress (‡ ξ).
Asset ↑↓−Liability = Ownership interest
For ﬁnancial reporting purposes the overhead costs paid are regarded immediately
as reducing the ownership claim because they are part of the expense of production
overhead. Figure 19.1 shows that in both ﬁnancial reporting and management
accounting the production overhead costs eventually emerge as a component of the
expense of cost of goods sold.

Transferring work in progress to finished goods
When the asset of work in progress is completed, it changes into another asset, the
stock of ﬁnished goods. In the accounting records the asset is removed from work in
progress and enjoys a new description as the asset of ﬁnished goods. (#)

Spreadsheet analysis
The transactions are brought together in spreadsheet form in Table 19.5 using a form
similar to that found in Chapters 5 and 6 of Financial Accounting. The entries on each
line correspond to the detailed analyses provided in this section. The totals at the foot
of each column represent the amounts of the various assets, liabilities and ownership
interest resulting from the transactions of the month. Cash has decreased overall by
£55,500. The asset of stock of materials (paper, inks, glues and dyes) has increased by
£70,000 and the asset of work in progress has increased by £3,000. The asset of ﬁnished
goods has increased by £8,000. The liability to the creditor stands at £177,500. Overall
the transactions of the month, as recorded here, have decreased the ownership interest
by £152,000, the amount which is recorded as the cost of goods sold.

19.4 Absorption costing and marginal costing
The problems of apportioning ﬁxed production overheads were explained in detail 
in Chapter 18. Because of the apportionment problems, there are situations in man-
agement accounting where it is preferable to avoid the problem by allocating only
variable costs to products. Fixed costs are regarded as costs of the period rather than
costs of the product. The question to be addressed in this section is how the choice
between absorption costing (which means absorbing all costs into products) and
marginal costing (which means taking in only the variable costs of production) may
be dependent on the purpose to which management accounting is being applied.
Definitions
In absorption costing (full costing), all production costs are absorbed into products 
and the unsold stock is measured at total cost of production.
In marginal costing (variable costing), only variable costs of production are allocated 
to products and the unsold stock is measured at variable cost of production. Fixed
production costs are treated as a cost of the period in which they are incurred.
19.4.1
A note on terminology
Some authors refer to ‘marginal costing’ while others refer to ‘variable costing’. The
strict interpretation of ‘marginal cost’ in economics is the additional cost of one more
unit of output. From the economists’ viewpoint that extra cost could include a stepped
increase in ﬁxed cost if capacity has to be expanded to produce one more item or a new
employee is required. For this section we assume that the range of activity is narrow
so that a marginal change in cost involves variable costs only.
19.4.2
Illustration of absorption and marginal costing
Take the example of a business planning its operations for ﬁve trading periods. Data
regarding budgeted selling price, budgeted variable cost per unit and ﬁxed production

Activity 19.3
Part 6 Job costs and stock valuation
532
overheads are given in Table 19.6, together with budgeted volumes of production and
sales over the next ﬁve periods of production. The question to be answered is, ‘How
much proﬁt is expected for each of the ﬁve trading periods?’
Under absorption costing the ﬁrst task is to decide how the ﬁxed costs for each
period should be allocated to products. Where production volume is varying in the
manner shown in Table 19.6, a common practice is to base the predetermined over-
head cost rate on the normal level of activity. In this case, it might be reasonable to take
a normal level of activity as the average production level, which is 250 units per
period. The predetermined ﬁxed overhead cost rate is therefore £2 per unit.
19.4.3
Absorption costing
Under absorption costing the opening and closing stock is valued at total cost of 
£11 per unit, comprising variable cost per unit of £9 and ﬁxed cost per unit of £2. 
Table 19.7 illustrates the absorption costing approach.
Go back to the data of Table 19.6. Cover up the answer in Table 19.7 and then attempt 
to write out the profit calculation under absorption costing. Add a note of narrative
explanation to each line as a means of helping understanding by yourself and others.
Make sure that you understand the absorption costing approach fully.

19.4.4
Marginal costing
Using marginal costing, the stock of unsold output at the end of each period would 
be valued at the variable cost of £9 per unit. The ﬁxed cost would be regarded as a 
cost of the period, without allocation to products. Table 19.8 illustrates the marginal
costing approach.
Look back at the data of Table 19.6. Before turning to the answer in Table 19.8 attempt to
write out the profit calculation under marginal costing. Add a note of narrative explanation
to each line as a means of helping understanding by yourself and others.
19.4.5
Comparison of profit under each approach
Table 19.9 compares the proﬁt calculated under each approach. The ﬁrst point to note
from Table 19.9 is that over the total period of time, where total production equals
total sales, there is no difference in total proﬁt. The difference between absorption cost-
ing and marginal costing is purely a result of timing of the matching of ﬁxed overhead
with products.
Before reading the rest of this section, write a brief commentary on the most significant
features of Table 19.9.
The second point to note is that the differences between the two proﬁt calculations
are based entirely on the change in volume of stock during the period, multiplied by
the ﬁxed overhead cost rate of £2 per unit. During period 1, stock increases by 30 units
over the period and, as a consequence, proﬁt under absorption costing is £60 higher

than under marginal costing. During period 2, stock increases by 60 units over the
period and, as a consequence, proﬁt under absorption costing is £120 higher. During
period 3 stock levels remain constant and therefore both approaches give the same
answer. During period 4, stock levels decrease by 40 units so that proﬁt under absorption
costing is £80 lower. During period 5, stock levels decrease by 50 units and therefore
proﬁt under absorption costing is £100 lower.
The third point to note is that the overall effect of the positive and negative differences
over the business life is zero, provided the allocation process is applied consistently.
Different allocation processes will cause costs to fall in different time periods, but they
cannot create or destroy costs in the total.
Finally, the effect of the change in stock levels may be understood using Table 19.9.
Making a general statement from this speciﬁc example, it appears safe to say that
when stock levels are increasing, proﬁt under absorption costing is higher than it 
is under marginal costing. That is because a portion of the ﬁxed production cost
incurred in the period is carried forward to the next period as part of the closing stock
valuation.
Generalising further from the analysis, it may be said that when stock levels are
decreasing, proﬁt under absorption costing is lower than it is under marginal costing.
That is because ﬁxed costs incurred in earlier periods are brought to the current period
as part of the opening stock, to be sold during the period.
When stock levels are constant, both approaches give the same answer.
19.4.6
Why is it necessary to understand the difference?
In Chapter 16 it was shown that management accounting has three major roles in
directing attention, keeping the score and solving problems. The particular role
which applies in any situation will depend upon the management function which is
being served. That management function could relate to the formation of a judgement
or to making a decision about a course of action. In Chapter 17 it was shown that the
classiﬁcation of costs is very much dependent on which of the three management
accounting roles is the dominant one in any speciﬁc situation and on the type of 
management function.
Where the management function relates to planning and control, the manage-
ment accountant is carrying out a score-keeping function and it is usually necessary 
to account for ﬁxed overhead costs of production as a part of the product cost. 
That means absorption costing is the appropriate approach. In this situation there 
is a strong overlap with ﬁnancial accounting and with external reporting to stake-
holders in a business. If the stakeholders are company shareholders, then the 
external reporting will be regulated by company law and accounting standards that
require ﬁxed costs of production to be treated as product costs and provide guidance
on the allocation process. Where the stakeholders are the electorate, in the case of 
a public sector body, or partners in a business partnership, the rules may be more 
ﬂexible, but in many cases they conventionally follow the practice recommended 
for companies.
19.4.7
Arguments in favour of absorption costing
The arguments put forward in favour of absorption costing are:
1 Since all production costs are incurred with a view to creating a product for sale, all
costs should attach to products until they are sold.
2 In the longer term, ﬁxed overhead costs must be recovered through sales if the 
business is to survive. Setting the stock value by reference to full costs encourages
a pricing policy which covers full cost.

Activity 19.6
Chapter 19 Job costing
535
3 If ﬁxed production costs are treated as period costs (as happens in marginal costing)
and there is a low level of sales activity in a period, then a relatively low proﬁt or a
loss will be reported. If there is a high level of sales activity, there will be a relatively
high proﬁt. Absorption costing creates a smoothing of these ﬂuctuations by carrying
the ﬁxed costs forward until the goods are sold.
19.4.8
Arguments in favour of marginal costing
Where the management accounting role is primarily that of directing attention and 
the management function is primarily one of decision making, it may be dangerous 
to regard ﬁxed production costs as product costs. The attractions of using marginal
costing in such a situation are as follows:
1 In the short term, relevant costs are required for decision making and ﬁxed over-
heads are largely non-relevant because they cannot be avoided. They are best seen
as a committed cost of the period.
2 Proﬁt calculation is not dependent on changes in stock levels. The illustration in
Tables 19.7 to 19.9 shows the practical effect of disentangling ﬁxed costs from stock
values.
3 There is no risk of carrying forward in stock an element of ﬁxed production over-
head cost which may not be recovered through sales.
4 Allocating all production costs to products and then applying full-cost pricing may
result in loss of sales which would have made a contribution to ﬁxed production
costs and proﬁt.
5 Where sales volumes are declining but output is sustained, marginal costing 
provides the proﬁt warning more rapidly than does absorption costing in a situation
where attention needs to be drawn urgently to the proﬁt implications.
Now that you understand the difference between marginal costing and absorption
costing, write a short evaluation of the two approaches.
19.5 Moving forward
Fiona McTaggart has participated in a number of consultancy projects where the 
traditional job costing approach has been modiﬁed to reﬂect changing circumstances.
Here she talks about three of them.
FIONA: I recall learning job costing at college and thinking that there must be more to life
than this. Since then I have found much more excitement in management accounting but
I still have to return to some of the basic principles – seeking where possible to identify costs
with products and making sensible allocations where such identification is not possible.
One of my clients is a production engineering business. I was working with the plant
controller, a qualified engineer with a good head for figures. The controller was looking for
a new management system which escaped from the traditional role of a financial system.
What was wanted was management in terms of the activities of the unit but with one eye
on the consequences in dollars. The controller wanted the production and engineering 
personnel to feel that they were in ownership of the management system. So I found myself
working in a team which drew on several specialisms, including engineering and human
resource management. We had to ask the financial accounting department, very politely, to
keep away while we developed our ideas because they kept quoting financial accounting

Part 6 Job costs and stock valuation
536
guidelines which were cramping our style. At the end of the day we did work out the cost
of a job undertaken by the business, but it was a cost which the engineers understood and
could relate to.
Another client is a telecommunications division of a major conglomerate. Their problem
was again related to engineers but with a different slant. The engineers were not sufficiently
aware of how their choice of operating methods could significantly alter total costs.
Traditional overhead costs were too blunt an instrument so we identified the actions which
drove costs and effectively turned indirect costs into direct costs. Every time an engineer
initiated a process, there was a cost reported. They soon began to concentrate on cost-
effective solutions. The end result was to identify the cost of a job but the engineers knew
how their choices had affected that cost.
My third client is a major hospital. In the area of health care, relations between medical
specialists and the accountants are always somewhat strained and have to be dealt with
carefully. The project in this case was to measure the cost of a treatment which involved
balancing length of stay, costs and patient welfare. There is a widely held belief that the
accountants merely calculate the cost of one overnight stay and then suggest reducing
overnight stays for all patients. In reality we worked closely with the clinical specialists 
so that an element of mutual respect was built up. We helped them to understand our
approach to determining the cost of a ‘job’ (not really the best term for treating a patient –
the experts prefer a ‘treatment protocol’). The treatment protocol is the standard method
for treating a specific condition. That method is developed by the medical experts. The
actual treatment does not necessarily follow the standard – if the patient needs extra care
then it is given. However, knowing the cost of the standard protocol allows comparative
evaluation of the actual treatment. Management accountants develop the cost systems
which are used as information by the case managers. The relationship is a partnership – the
accountants don’t dictate the medical treatment but it remains necessary for the medical
experts to know what each treatment of each patient has cost.
The common feature of all these cases which I have described is that the management
accounting system produced a report which included a cost for each ‘job’. However, it was
by no means a mechanical process carried out in isolation. It involved the management
accountant becoming part of the operational team. The days of a separate management
accounting department in some remote part of an administrative office are gone. The 
management accountant has to be alongside those who are delivering the product.
19.6 Summary
This chapter has drawn on the information and deﬁnitions contained in Chapters 4
and 5 to show the method of preparing job cost statements. Job costing will be found
in service businesses as well as in manufacturing. The essential condition is that there
is an identiﬁable job (item of output) for which costs may be collected with a view to
determining the cost of the job. The chapter has also explained the differences between
absorption costing and marginal costing.
Key themes in this chapter are:
l A job-costing system is a system of cost accumulation where there is an identiﬁable
activity for which costs may be collected. The activity is usually speciﬁed in terms
of a job of work or a group of tasks contributing to a stage in the production or 
service process.
l A job-cost record shows the costs of materials, labour and overhead incurred on 
a particular job.
l The prime cost of production is equal to the total of direct materials, direct labour
and other direct costs.

Chapter 19 Job costing
537
l The production overhead cost comprises indirect materials, indirect labour and
other indirect costs of production.
l The total product cost comprises prime cost plus production overhead cost.
l In absorption costing (full costing), all production costs are absorbed into products.
The unsold inventory is measured at total cost of production. Fixed production
overhead costs are treated as a product cost.
l In marginal costing (variable costing), only variable costs of production are allocated
to products. The unsold inventory is measured at variable cost of production. Fixed
production overhead costs are treated as a period cost of the period in which they
are incurred.
l Under-absorbed or over-absorbed ﬁxed overhead cost may arise in absorption 
costing. It is reported in the proﬁt and loss statement as an adjustment to cost 
of sales.
l Proﬁt under absorption costing differs from proﬁt under marginal costing when
inventory levels are changing. If total production equals total sales there is no 
difference in total proﬁt.
l When inventory levels are falling, proﬁt under absorption costing is lower than
proﬁt under marginal costing. The difference is equal to the decrease in inventory 
levels multiplied by the ﬁxed overhead cost rate.
l When inventory levels are rising, proﬁt under absorption costing is higher than
proﬁt under marginal costing. The difference is equal to the increase in inventory 
levels multiplied by the ﬁxed overhead cost rate.
l Absorption costing is usually required for inventory valuation in ﬁnancial account-
ing standards or other regulations. Those using such ﬁnancial statements need to be
aware that reported proﬁt can be affected by the change in the volume of inventory
over the period.
l Marginal costing may be more useful for decision making because it treats ﬁxed
production overhead costs as a cost of the period. Reported proﬁt is not affected by
the changes in inventory held.

The first customer is willing to place orders in three different sizes at the following selling
prices:
Order size
Selling price per package
£
430 packages per day
25.20
880 packages per day
25.00

The customer will enter into an initial contract of 30 days’ duration and will uplift completed
packages on a daily basis from the premises of Insulation Ltd.
The following assumptions have been made in respect of Insulation Ltd:
(a) In view of the competitive market the selling prices are not negotiable.
(b) Direct materials will cost £23.75 per package irrespective of the order size.
(c) The output of one machine will be 350 packages per shift.
(d) A maximum of three shifts will be available on a machine within one day. The depreciation
charge for a machine will be £100 per day, irrespective of the number of shifts worked.
(e) Labour costs to operate a machine will be £100 for the first shift, £120 for the second shift
and £160 for the third shift of the day. If labour is required for a shift, then the full shift must
be paid for regardless of the number of packages produced.
(f) The total cost of supervising the employees for each of the first two shifts in any day will be
£20 per machine. The supervision cost of the third shift will be £40 per machine.
(g) Other fixed overhead costs will be £280 per day if one machine is used. Buying and using
an additional machine would result in a further £100 of fixed costs per day.
(h) Production and sales volume will be equal regardless of order size.

1 For each order size, details of the overall profitability per day and net profit per package.
2 An explanation of the differing amounts of profit per package.
Activities for study groups
Case 19.1
As a group, you are planning to establish a partnership supplying examination advice and tuition
to school pupils in their homes. Each course of lessons will be regarded as a single ‘job’.
Courses may vary in length and in target ability level, depending on the requirements of the
pupil to be tutored. Divide the group to take on three different roles. One role is that of a tutor
who is also a member of the partnership, sharing equally the profits of the business. The sec-
ond role is that of the accountancy adviser to the partnership. The third role is that of a parent
making enquiries about the price charged and the justification for that price.
Each member of the group should take on one of the three roles and separately make a 
note of:
(a) The expected costs of a job (in terms of types of cost).
(b) How you would justify the costs (if supplying the service).
(c) How you would question the costs (if receiving the service).
Then all members of the group should come together, compare answers, and finally prepare a
joint report on the problems of job costing in a service business.

study now but only attempt the discussion points after you have finished reading the chapter.
BHP to abandon titanium mining
BHP Billiton is to abandon its involvement in
titanium mining and has also confirmed cutbacks
in nickel ore production in response to weaker
metal prices and the impact of a strengthened
Australian dollar. The world’s biggest mining
company by market value confirmed on Wednesday
it was selling its 37 per cent stake in Richards Bay
Minerals, the South African titanium producer, to
Rio Tinto, which already owns a 37 per cent stake.
The sale, for an undisclosed sum, marks a further
restructuring of BHP’s diamonds and speciality
products business, historically a small contributor to group earnings, which are driven by iron ore, copper, and oil.
BHP said in November that it was exploring whether to put its diamonds business, centred on the Ekati mine in
Canada, up for sale.
Both moves follow the promotion of Graham Kerr, the division’s former president, to become BHP’s chief financial
officer from the beginning of this year.
Rio Tinto, which produces titanium at an operation in Madagascar, will double its share in RBM to 74 per cent.
BHP described RBM, which is also a producer of iron ore, as ‘the primary producer of chloride titanium feedstock’
and ‘one of the world’s highest margin heavy minerals businesses’.
Last year, the venture achieved sales of $1bn, with gross margins of 38 per cent. But BHP said the titanium
minerals industry was one of the smallest markets in which it participated and was ‘unlikely to make a significant
contribution to the company’s future profitability’. The decision by BHP to abandon its interest in producing the
lightweight industrial metal is consistent with other planned moves out of more peripheral markets.
It coincides with a decision by BHP to cut 150 staff and temporarily reduce mining production at its Nickel West
unit centred on operations at Mount Keith, in Western Australia. The unit is Australia’s largest nickel producer but,
in the year to June, nickel generated less than 2 per cent of BHP’s operating profit.
BHP said on Thursday it would spend $779m to expand its iron ore shipping facilities at Port Hedland in Western
Australia by 100m tonnes per year.
The project, which is expected to be reviewed for full approval in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2012, has an
embedded option to expand by a further 100m tonnes per year, the company said.

20.1 Introduction
In Chapter 16 the role of management accounting was explained in terms of directing
attention, keeping the score and solving problems. This chapter turns to the problem
solving aspect of the management accountant’s work and in particular to the use of
management accounting information to help with decisions in the short term (where
the short term is typically a period of weeks or months, extending to 12 months at the
most, in which some costs are ﬁxed and others are variable, depending on the level of
activity). Chapter 23 explains the use of management accounting in making decisions
about the longer term.
The classification of costs was explained at length in Chapter 17. If you have any doubts
about that chapter, go back and work through it again. It is essential that Chapter 17 is
understood before this chapter is attempted.
This chapter will ﬁrst explain how costs and revenues behave in the short term as
the volume of activity increases. This is called cost–volume–profit analysis. It makes
use of graphs which will help you follow the analysis of costs, revenues and proﬁts.
The chapter explains the calculation of contribution and shows how it is used to identify
the break-even point of neither proﬁt nor loss.
The chapter will then show how the distinction between variable cost and fixed
cost may be used in short-term decision making in situations of special orders, aban-
donment of a product line and the existence of limiting factors. They are set out as case
studies so that you will see that each problem, while using the same principles of
cost–volume–proﬁt analysis, requires some adaptability in using the analysis in the
speciﬁc circumstances.
Pricing decisions will often require management accounting information about
how the price charged for a product or service matches up to the cost of that product
or service. Note, however, that the price which consumers are willing to pay may be
decided by economic forces rather than by the costs incurred. You will see in this 
chapter the main approaches to pricing and the role of costs in those approaches.
20.2 Cost behaviour: fixed and variable costs
Chapter 17 explained that cost classiﬁcation systems are as varied as the businesses
they serve. Types of cost classiﬁcation system were identiﬁed in that chapter by reference
to questions which needed answers. Chapter 17 also provided deﬁnitions of variable
cost and ﬁxed cost, while Figures 17.1, 17.2 and 17.3 showed different types of cost
behaviour as activity increased.
Definitions
A variable cost is one which varies directly with changes in the level of activity, over a
defined period of time.
A fixed cost is one which is not affected by changes in the level of activity, over a
defined period of time.
This chapter now moves on from that starting point outlined in Chapter 17 to ask
more questions about the relationships between cost, volume of output and proﬁt.
There are two ways of viewing the behaviour of cost in relation to activity level. One
is referred to as the economist’s view and the other is referred to as the accountant’s view.

Chapter 20 Break-even analysis and short-term decision making
547
Each is discussed here, and the use of the accountant’s view is then justiﬁed as a 
reasonable short-term approximation.
20.2.1
The economist’s view
Figure 20.1 shows total cost related to activity level over a wide range of activity
within a business. Starting at zero activity, there is a total cost of £200,000 shown 
representing the ﬁxed cost of the operations, including items such as rent of premises,
business rates, administration salaries and any similar costs incurred to allow oper-
ations to commence. Initially, the slope of the graph rises relatively steeply because
high levels of costs are incurred as activity begins. Then the slope becomes less steep
as the business begins to enjoy the economies of scale, sharing ﬁxed costs over a wider
range of activity so that the marginal cost of producing an extra item becomes 
progressively less. At the extreme right-hand side of the graph the slope begins to rise
more steeply again as further ﬁxed costs are incurred. Perhaps high rental has to be
paid for new premises at this point to allow expansion, or labour resources become
more scarce and higher labour rates have to be paid to employ staff.
To calculate proﬁt, a business must compare its cost with its revenue. The economist’s
portrayal of revenue is superimposed on the cost line in Figure 20.2. The total revenue
Figure 20.1
Total cost varying with activity
Figure 20.2
Revenue and costs: the economist’s view

Part 7 Decision making
548
starts at zero when there is zero activity. It rises rapidly when supply begins and 
customers are willing to pay relatively high prices for the goods. Then, as supply
increases, the marginal selling price of each item decreases progressively as it becomes
more difﬁcult to sell larger volumes of output. Where the total revenue line is below the
total cost line the business is making a loss, and where the total revenue line is above
the total cost line the business is making a proﬁt. The business represented by the graph
in Figure 20.2 shows losses at the left-hand and right-hand sides of the diagram and a
proﬁt in the centre. Successful businesses aim to stay in the proﬁt-making region.
20.2.2
The accountant’s view
The economist’s view of costs covers a very wide range of output. In any particular
period, especially in the short term, the actual range of output will be relatively 
narrow. Looking at Figure 20.2 the lines close to the break-even point are close to being
straight lines over a narrow range either side. Accounting assumes that at any point in
time this relatively narrow range is available in practice and so the cost and revenue
curves are approximately straight lines.
The data in Table 20.1 is used in this section to illustrate the accountant’s view of
how costs change with levels of activity.

The graph in Figure 20.2 represents activity level changes which could take some
time to achieve as the business grows. The accountant takes a much shorter time 
perspective and looks at a relatively limited range of activity that might be achieved
within that time period. In those circumstances, it may be reasonable to use straight-
line graphs rather than curves, although great care is needed before assuming it is safe
to use straight lines.
Using the data of Table 20.1, a graph of variable cost is shown in Figure 20.3 and a
graph of ﬁxed cost is shown in Figure 20.4.
Figure 20.3
Variable cost

Chapter 20 Break-even analysis and short-term decision making
549
In Figure 20.5, these two graphs are added together to give a graph of total cost. The
total cost starts at £20 and increases by £10 for every 100 units of activity. The total cost
line meets the vertical axis at the ﬁxed cost amount of £20. The slope of the total cost
line gives a picture of how fast the variable costs are rising as activity level increases.
The proﬁt of the business is measured by comparing costs with revenues. Here
again, the accountant takes the view that it may be reasonable, over a short timescale
and relatively limited range of activity, to use a straight line. In Figure 20.6, a sales

Fixed cost

Total cost

Part 7 Decision making
550
line is added based on a selling price of 30 pence per unit, so that total sales are £30 for
100 units, £60 for 200 units and £90 for 300 units.
The sales line is below the cost line at the left-hand side of the graph, crossing 
the cost line when the activity is 100 units. This shows that for activity levels below 
100 units the business will make a loss. At 100 units of activity the business makes 
neither proﬁt nor loss. This is called the break-even point. Beyond 100 units of activ-
ity the business makes a proﬁt and the amount of proﬁt is measured by the vertical
difference between the sales and cost lines.
Definition
The break-even point is that point of activity (measured as sales volume) where total
sales and total cost are equal, so that there is neither profit nor loss.
The graph shown in Figure 20.6 is more commonly called a break-even chart. 
It shows the activity level at which total costs equal total sales and at which the 
business makes neither a proﬁt nor a loss. It also shows what happens to costs and 
revenues on either side of this break-even point. If activity falls below the break-even
level, then the amount of loss will be measured by the vertical distance between the
cost and sales line.
If activity rises above the break-even level then the amount of proﬁt will be measured
by the vertical distance between the sales and cost line. If the business is operating at
an activity level higher than the break-even point, the distance between these two
points is called the margin of safety. The margin of safety indicates how much activity
has to fall from its present level before proﬁt becomes zero.
Definition
The margin of safety is the difference between the break-even sales and the normal
level of sales (measured in units or in £s of sales).
Figure 20.7 summarises the various features of a break-even chart. The use of a
chart of this type to depict the behaviour of costs and sales over a range of activity in
the short term has been found extremely helpful in presenting management accounting
information to non-ﬁnancial managers who are involved in making decisions which
have ﬁnancial consequences.

20.2.3
Cost–volume–profit analysis
Cost–volume–proﬁt analysis is based on the idea that in the short run it is possible to
survive in business providing sales revenue covers variable cost. The contribution
from a product is the amount by which its selling price exceeds its variable cost. The
excess of selling price over variable cost makes a contribution to covering ﬁxed costs
and then making a proﬁt. In the short run it may be worth continuing in business if
the selling price is greater than variable cost, so that there is a contribution to ﬁxed
costs, even where some part of the ﬁxed costs is not covered. In the long term it is
essential to earn sufﬁcient sales revenue to cover all costs.
Definition
Contribution per unit is the selling price per unit minus the variable cost per unit. 
It measures the contribution made by each item of output to the fixed costs and profit 
of the organisation.
20.3 Break-even analysis
Break-even analysis is a technique of management accounting which is based on 
calculating the break-even point and analysing the consequences of changes in vari-
ous factors calculating the break-even point. The idea of contribution is central to
break-even analysis in evaluating the effects of various short-term decisions.
This section explains ways of ﬁnding the break-even point. It uses the information
in Exhibit 20.1 to compare different approaches.
Exhibit 20.1
Illustration: market trader
A market trader rents a stall at a fixed price of £200 for a day and sells souvenirs.
These cost the trader 50 pence each to buy and have a selling price of 90 pence
each. How many souvenirs must be sold to break even?
Hopefully, you will find the case study so easy to solve that you will already have
computed the answer. If so, then analyse how you arrived at the answer before you 
read the next paragraphs and compare your method with the descriptions given there. 
It is always better to work out a method for yourself, if it is a good one, than to try
remembering something from a book.
20.3.1
Calculating the break-even point
Calculating contribution
The contribution from a product is the amount by which its selling price exceeds its
variable cost. The idea of contribution is central to break-even analysis in evaluating
the effects of various decisions.
Once the contribution per unit is known it can be compared with the fixed costs.
The business does not begin to make a proﬁt until the ﬁxed costs are covered, so the
formula is applied as:
Break-even point
equals
Fixed costs
Contribution per unit

Part 7 Decision making
552
Taking the data from the illustration in Exhibit 20.1, the contribution is 40 pence 
per souvenir (selling price 90 pence minus variable cost 50 pence) and the ﬁxed costs
are £200:
Break-even point =
= 500 units
Algebraic method
The equation for the break-even point is:
Sales
equals
Fixed costs + Variable costs
If the number of souvenirs sold at the break-even point is n, then the total sales 
revenue is 0.9n and the total variable cost is 0.5n:
0.9n = 200 + 0.5n
0.4n = 200
Solving the equation, n = 500 souvenirs need to be sold to break even.
20.3.2
Break-even chart
The general appearance of a break-even chart has already been shown in Figure 20.7.
To plot the graph some points on each line are necessary. Because they are all straight
lines only two points are needed, together with a ruler and pencil to join them. Points
on a graph may be deﬁned by specifying two co-ordinates in the form (x, y). A point
deﬁned as (10, 100) means that it lies at the intersection of a line up from 10 on the 
horizontal (x) axis and a line across from 100 on the vertical (y) axis. In Figure 20.8,
two points are plotted, namely, (10, 100) and (30, 300). These may then be joined by a
straight line.

Figure 20.8
Plotting points for a graph  
The graph needs to cover an activity scale wide enough to show both sides of the
break-even point, so it is a useful idea to work round the break-even point by choos-
ing one point which is loss making and one point which is proﬁt making. The point of
zero activity will usually be loss making because there is nil revenue but there are
ﬁxed costs. So the start of the sales line can be plotted at (0, 0) and the start of the cost
line at (0, £200). For a position of proﬁt, the sales and total cost must be calculated for
a higher activity level, which in this case might be 900 souvenirs:
Sales of 900 souvenirs at 90 pence each = £810

The sales line will therefore join the points (0, £0) and (900, £810):

Profit–volume graph
Defining the profit–volume ratio
Proﬁt is an important aspect of most management accounting reports. However, the
break-even chart does not show directly the amount of proﬁt. It has to be estimated by
measuring the vertical distance between the sales and total cost lines. There is another
form of graph used in management accounting called a profit–volume chart. On the
horizontal axis is plotted the volume, measured by activity level in £s of sales, and on
the vertical axis is plotted the proﬁt at that activity level.
The activity level is measured in £s of sales in order that the slope of the graph
matches the profit/volume ratio, a slightly confusing name for the ratio which calcu-
lates contribution as a percentage of sales value:
Profit/volume ratio
equals
× 100
Figure 20.10 sets out a diagram showing the main features of a proﬁt–volume chart.
Illustration of a profit–volume chart
Taking the data used in preparing Figure 20.8, the preparation of a proﬁt–volume
graph requires only the proﬁt line to be drawn. When sales are zero, there will be a
loss equal to the ﬁxed cost, which gives the ﬁrst point to plot at (£0, −£200). When 900
units are sold the sales are £810 and the proﬁt is £160, giving the second point to plot
at (£810, £160). The result is shown in Figure 20.11. The gridlines are included to show
where the proﬁt line has been plotted. The break-even point of zero proﬁt or loss is at

20.4 Using break-even analysis
Break-even analysis is a very useful tool. It may be used to answer questions of the
following type:
l What level of sales is necessary to cover fixed costs and make a speciﬁed proﬁt?
l What is the effect of contribution per unit beyond the break-even point?
l What happens to the break-even point when the selling price of one unit changes?
l What happens to the break-even point when the variable cost per unit changes?
l What happens to the break-even point when the ﬁxed costs change?
Each of these questions is now dealt with in this section by an illustration and an
explanation following the illustration.

20.4.1
Covering fixed costs and making a profit
To ﬁnd the level of sales necessary to cover ﬁxed costs and make a speciﬁed proﬁt
requires a knowledge of selling price per unit, variable cost per unit and the ﬁxed costs
together with the desired proﬁt. These are set out in the data table.
Data
Selling price per unit
80 pence
Variable cost per unit
30 pence
Fixed cost
£300
Desired level of profit
£400
The contribution per unit is 50 pence (80 pence −30 pence). To ﬁnd the break-even
point, the ﬁxed costs of £300 are divided by the contribution per unit to obtain a break-
even point of 600 units.
To meet ﬁxed costs of £300 and desired proﬁt of £400 requires the contribution to
cover £700 in all. This is achieved by selling 1,400 units.
Volume of sales required =
= 1,400 units
Check that 1,400 units at a contribution of 50 pence each gives a total contribution 
of £700. It is always a useful precaution to check the arithmetic of a calculation as 
a safeguard against carelessness.
20.4.2
Beyond the break-even point
Beyond the break-even point the ﬁxed costs are covered and the sales of further units
are making a contribution to proﬁt. The higher the contribution per unit, the greater the
proﬁt from any particular level of activity. The data table sets out some information on
selling prices, variable costs and ﬁxed costs of two products.
Data
A dry-cleaning shop takes two types of clothing. Jackets cost £6 to clean and the
customer is charged £9 per garment. Coats cost £10 to clean and the customer 
is charged £12 per garment. The monthly fixed costs are £600 for each type of
garment (representing the rental costs of two different types of machine). The shop
expects to clean 500 jackets and 500 coats each month.
Before reading the analysis following Figure 20.11, calculate the contribution made by
each product, work out the break-even point of each, and then explore the effect on the
break-even point of:
(a) changes in the price charged to customers;
(b) changes in the variable costs; and
(c) changes in the fixed costs.
If you have access to a spreadsheet package this is the kind of problem for which
spreadsheets are highly suitable.

20.4.3
Margin of safety
The margin of safety has been deﬁned as the difference between the break-even sales
and the normal level of sales, measured in units or in dollars of sales. In the case of the
dry-cleaning shop, the margin of safety for jackets is 300 jackets (500 − 200) when 500
jackets are cleaned each month. The margin of safety for coats is 200 coats (500 −300)
when 500 coats are cleaned each month. The margin of safety is interpreted by saying
that cleaning of jackets may fall by 300 per month before the break-even point is
reached but cleaning of coats will reach the break-even point after a reduction of only
200 in coats cleaned. Cleaning coats is therefore riskier than cleaning jackets, if
expected output is compared to break-even volume.
20.4.4
Change in selling price
If the selling price per unit increases and costs remain constant, then the contribution
per unit will increase and the break-even volume will be lower. Take as an example
the dry-cleaning business of the previous illustration. If the selling price of cleaning a
coat rises to £15, then the contribution per unit will rise to £5. That will require clean-
ing only 120 coats to break even. The risk of raising the price is that customers may
move elsewhere, so that while it may not be difﬁcult to exceed the break-even point at
a selling price of £12 it may be extremely difﬁcult at a selling price of £15.
20.4.5
Change in variable cost
The effect of a change in variable cost is very similar to the effect of a change in 
selling price. If the variable cost per unit increases, then the contribution per unit will
decrease, with the result that more items will have to be sold in order to reach the
break-even point. If it is possible to reduce variable costs, then the contribution per
unit will increase. The enterprise will reach the break-even point at a lower level of
activity and will then be earning proﬁts at a faster rate.
20.4.6
Change in fixed costs
If fixed costs increase, then more units have to be sold in order to reach the break-even
point. Where the ﬁxed costs of an operation are relatively high, there is a perception
of greater risk because a cutback in activity for any reason is more likely to lead to a
loss. Where an organisation has relatively low ﬁxed costs, there may be less concern
about margins of safety because the break-even point is correspondingly lower.

The calculations set out in Table 20.2 show that, although both products have the
same ﬁxed costs, the jackets have a lower break-even point because they make a higher
contribution per unit. Beyond the break-even point they continue to contribute more
per unit. The proﬁts at any given level of activity are therefore higher for jackets.

20.5 Limitations of break-even analysis
Break-even analysis is a useful tool for problem solving and decision making, but
some of the limitations should be noted:
1 The break-even analysis assumes that cost and revenue behaviour patterns are
known and that the change in activity levels can be represented by a straight line.
2 It may not always be feasible to split costs neatly into variable and ﬁxed categories.
Some costs show mixed behaviour.
3 The break-even analysis assumes that ﬁxed costs remain constant over the volume
range under consideration. If that is not the case, then the graph of total costs will
have a step in it where the ﬁxed costs are expected to increase.
4 Break-even analysis, as described so far in this book, assumes input and output 
volumes are the same, so that there is no build-up of stocks and work in progress.
5 Break-even charts and simple analyses can only deal with one product at a time.
6 It is assumed that cost behaviour depends entirely on volume.
These limitations may be overcome by modifying the break-even analysis.
However, that would involve considerably more computation work and is beyond the
scope of this book.
20.6 Applications of cost–volume–profit analysis
Break-even analysis is a particular example of the more general technique of cost–
volume–proﬁt analysis. This analysis emphasises the relationship between sales 
revenue, costs and proﬁt in the short term. In this context the short term is a period 
of time over which some costs are ﬁxed, whatever the level of output within 
a range limited by the existing capacity of the business. In the longer term, all costs
become variable because the capacity of a business can be altered by acquiring new
premises, hiring more employees or investing in more equipment.
Definition
Cost–volume–profit analysis evaluates the effects of forecast changes in sales, variable
costs and fixed costs, to assist in decision making.
In using cost–volume–profit analysis, management accounting is meeting the needs
of directing attention and solving problems. In the short term, decisions have to be
made within the existing constraints of the capacity of the business and the aim of 
that decision making will be to maximise short-term proﬁt. Typical decision-making
situations requiring cost–volume–proﬁt analysis would be:
l accepting a special order to use up spare capacity
l abandoning a line of business
l the existence of a limiting factor
l carrying out an activity in-house rather than buying in a service under contract.
Each of these situations is now considered in turn.
Those who comment on the applications of cost–volume–profit analysis always emphasise
that it is a short-run decision-making tool. Write a 200-word note explaining this view.

Part 7 Decision making
558
20.6.1
Special order to use up spare capacity
In the short term, a business must ensure that the revenue from each item of activity
at least covers variable costs and makes a contribution to ﬁxed costs. Once the ﬁxed
costs are covered by contribution, the greater the level of activity, the higher the proﬁt.
When the business reaches full capacity there will be a new element of ﬁxed cost to
consider should the business decide to increase its capacity. If there is no increase in
capacity, then the business should concentrate on those activities producing the highest
contribution per unit or per item.
But supposing the business is not operating at full capacity. Should it lower its sales
price in an attempt to increase the volume of activity? The question may arise in the
form of a request from a customer for a special price for a particular order. (Customers
may well know that the business is not operating at full capacity and may therefore try
to use their bargaining power to force a lower sales price.) Should the business accept
the special order? Cost–volume–proﬁt analysis gives the answer that the special order
is acceptable provided the sales price per item covers the variable costs per item and
provided there is no alternative use for the spare capacity which could result in a
higher contribution per item.
20.6.2
Abandonment of a line of business
The management of a business may be concerned because one line of business appears
not to be covering all its costs. This situation may arise particularly where costs are being
used for score-keeping purposes and all ﬁxed costs have been allocated to products.
As was shown in Chapter 18, the allocation of ﬁxed costs to products is a process
which is somewhat arbitrary in nature, and is not relevant to decision making 
because the ﬁxed costs are incurred irrespective of whether any business activity 
takes place.
When a line of business comes under scrutiny as to its proﬁtability, cost–volume–
proﬁt analysis shows that in the short term it is worth continuing with the line if 
it makes a contribution to ﬁxed costs. If the line of business is abandoned and 
nothing better takes its place, then that contribution is lost but the ﬁxed costs run on
regardless.
20.6.3
Existence of a limiting factor
In the short term, it may be that one of the inputs to a business activity is restricted in
its availability. There may be a shortage of raw materials or a limited supply of skilled
labour. There may be a delivery delay on machinery or a planning restriction which
prevents the extension of a building on the business premises. There may then be a
need to choose from a range of possible activities so as to maximise short-term proﬁt.
The item which is restricted in availability is called the limiting factor.
Cost–volume–proﬁt analysis shows that maximisation of proﬁt will occur if the
activity is chosen which gives the highest contribution per unit of limiting factor.
20.6.4
In-house activity versus bought-in contract
For a manufacturing business, there may be a decision between making a component
in-house as compared with buying the item ready-made. For a service business there
may be a decision between employing staff in-house and using the services of an agency
which supplies staff as and when required. Cost–volume–proﬁt analysis shows that
the decision should be based on comparison of variable costs per unit, relating this to
the difference in ﬁxed costs between the options.

Chapter 20 Break-even analysis and short-term decision making
559
20.7 Cases in short-term decision making
Cost–volume–proﬁt analysis is particularly well suited to management needs in short-
term decision making. Fiona McTaggart now discusses four cases she has come across
where cost–volume–proﬁt analysis has been relevant. The ﬁrst relates to a decision
about taking on a special order to ﬁll a gap where the business was not running at full
capacity. The second relates to a potential abandonment of a line of business, the third
deals with a limiting factor causing scarcity of an input to the production process, and
the fourth relates to buying in services.
20.7.1
Decisions on special orders
FIONA: My first story is about a car hire business in a holiday resort which was experien-
cing a temporary fall in activity in the run-up to the start of the tourist season. Their normal
charge was £3.00 per mile, to cover all costs including the driver’s wages. A telephone
installation company offered a three-month contract to run engineers between two towns
on a return journey of 100 miles, at a fixed price of £180 per journey. The car hire company
asked my advice about accepting this offer of £1.80 per mile.
I asked the company what the drivers and cars would be doing each day if the contract
was not taken up and the answer was that they would not be doing anything other than
waiting at the depot and cleaning their cars. My advice was that, on that basis, the contract
would be worth undertaking if it covered the variable costs of each journey and made a
contribution to fixed costs and profit.
We sat down to look at the fixed costs and produced the statement shown in Table 20.3.
Quite deliberately I did not write any amounts against the separate items of fixed costs
because I wanted to emphasise that these are the unavoidable element which will arise
whether or not the contract is taken up.
From the data provided, I calculated the variable cost per mile as 20 pence for petrol and
8 pence for tyres, giving 28 pence in all. The normal charge of £3.00 per mile is intended
to cover this 28 pence per mile plus the fixed cost per mile, amounting to £2.10 per mile
using the average annual mileage per car. That total cost of £2.38 per mile leaves a profit
of 62 pence per mile or £24,800 per annum if the average mileage is achieved.
It is clear that to cover all costs the charge of £3.00 is probably about right, but if the
drivers and cars are otherwise unoccupied, extra journeys on the special contract contribute
£1.52 per mile (£1.80 −£0.28) to fixed costs and profit. I advised them to take up the 
contract on two conditions:
1 they must be as sure as they could be that there will not be an upturn in business during
the hire period which would mean they were turning down the possibility of carrying
passengers who would pay £3.00 per mile; and
2 if the journeys involve extra payments to drivers for overtime or late-night work, those
extra payments should be regarded as part of the variable cost of the contract and the
costings recalculated on that basis.
They took my advice and carried out the contract. It fitted perfectly into the quiet period of
business and the company realised later that the contract had made a useful contribution
to profit at a time when drivers and cars would otherwise have been inactive.
In Fiona’s example, the company made use of the idea that, in the short term, any
contract is worth taking on if it covers variable costs and makes some contribution to
ﬁxed costs and proﬁt. Care needs to be taken that the special order does not create a
precedent for future work, particularly if existing customers ﬁnd that special treatment
is being given which appears to undercut the price they are paying. The company may

Part 7 Decision making
560
ﬁnd it difﬁcult in future to return to the price which covers all costs. In the long term,
the company must charge a price which covers ﬁxed costs as well as variable costs if
it is to survive.
Fiona’s second illustration relates to a decision on abandoning a line of activity.
20.7.2
Abandonment decisions
FIONA: A private tuition college was providing two types of secretarial training course. The
first was teaching word processing and the second was teaching office skills. The college
had produced the profit and loss statement shown in Table 20.4.
On the basis of this profit and loss statement the owners of the business were on the
point of cancelling all further courses in office skills. I asked them how they had decided
on the allocation of fixed overheads and they explained that these comprised primarily
administrative staff costs and permanent teaching staff, plus items such as rent and 
business rates as well as depreciation of word processors and of the equipment used 
in the cabin which had been set up to simulate the most up-to-date office conditions. 
The cabin itself was depreciated over 20 years. Fixed overhead which could be allocated
directly to the relevant courses, such as depreciation of equipment, was allocated in its
entirety to the relevant course type. This approach was also used for teaching costs where
these were specific to one course type. Fixed overhead which could apply to each type 
of course, such as administrative staff salaries, was spread in proportion to the number 
of courses given.

I pointed out to the owners that their profit and loss statement would be more informative
if it were set out in the format shown in Table 20.5.
From Table 20.5 it is relatively straightforward to see that the office skills programme is
making a contribution of £170,000 to fixed costs and profit, after covering its own variable
costs. If the programme were not offered, then the business would have only the con-
tribution of £285,000 from word processing which would not cover the fixed overhead of
£340,000. Far from abandoning the office skills programme, it was essential to retain it. The
allocation of fixed overheads was, for short-term analysis purposes, irrelevant. The cabin and
office equipment had already been purchased and would continue to depreciate whether
used or not. If put up for sale, these assets would have a negligible value. Administrative
and permanent staff were also in place and could not instantly be disengaged.
I advised them that while it was preferable in the short term to keep both programmes
running, there were some questions they should ask themselves for longer-term planning:
1 To what extent do clients take up the word processing courses because the office skills
course may be studied at the same time and in the same place?
2 How much fixed cost could be avoided in the longer term if either course ceased to
exist?
3 Would it be a more effective use of resources to concentrate only on one type of course
so that the fixed costs are restricted to one type of equipment and perhaps relatively
fewer administrative staff?
The answers might lead to reorganisation towards one type of course only. On the other
hand, it might be found that the two programmes are so interrelated that each needs the
other and the fixed costs are effectively essential to both, whatever the accounting allo-
cation process.
Fiona’s third story concerns a business where there was a restriction in the amount
of a factor of input to the production process.
20.7.3
Existence of limiting factors
FIONA: A kitchen equipment service company had come across a problem of a shortage of
trained engineers in a district because new oil exploration activity had attracted the best
staff by making offers of high salaries.
On a short-term basis the company felt it could not continue to service washing
machines, dishwashers and built-in ovens in that area and would prefer to concentrate
on the most proﬁtable use of its labour resource. Table 20.6 shows the most recent
annual data available, based on the situation before the employee shortage crisis arose.
However, the total labour force now available was estimated in cost terms at £40,000
in total.

I advised them that, in these circumstances, the limiting factor of labour should be used 
so as to maximise the contribution from every £ of labour used. First, I calculated the 
contribution per £ of scarce resource for each of the three types of service contract 
(see Table 20.7).
The highest contribution per £ of labour is therefore provided by dishwashers, followed by
built-in ovens. So I explained that it would be best to use the scarce labour resource first
of all to service dishwashers. At the existing level of sales that would take up £30,000 worth
of labour, leaving the balance of £10,000 worth of labour to service built-in ovens on a
restricted basis. If more dishwasher work became available, that would be the preferred
choice for profit generation.
This would be a short-term solution, but in the longer term it would be essential to con-
sider whether the market could stand higher charges for servicing equipment, which would
allow higher wage rates to be paid and thus permit all three types of work to continue.
Fiona has used in this example a particular case of a general principle that where
limiting factors apply, proﬁt is made as high as possible where the greatest contri-
bution is obtained each time the scarce resource is used.
20.7.4
Make or buy
The management of a manufacturing business may have to decide whether to make a
component in-house or buy the item ready-made.
Fiona McTaggart explains the problem:
FIONA: A car manufacturer has a problem regarding one quite small component used on 
a production line. The component may be purchased from an external supplier at £100 per
item. It is currently being manufactured in-house at a cost of £110 per item, comprising
fixed cost £30 per item and variable cost £80 per item. Annual output is currently 50,000
components and the trend of output is expected to be rising.

The external price looks attractive at first glance but, before I can advise the car manu-
facturer, I need to know more about the fixed cost. It is currently £1,500,000 per annum
(£30 times 50,000 components). If the company can avoid the fixed cost by purchasing
from the outside supplier, then I will compare the additional variable cost of £20 (£100 −
£80) with the saving of £1,500,000. The company breaks even at 75,000 components 
(calculated as fixed cost saving of £1,500,000 divided by additional variable cost of £20). 
If demand is less than 75,000 then it is more cost-effective to buy from the external 
supplier. If demand is more than 75,000 then it is more cost-effective to manufacture 
in-house (provided fixed costs do not change at a higher level of output).
If the fixed cost of £1,500,000 cannot be avoided (perhaps it represents rent and 
property costs which would be incurred even if there were no production), then there is 
no advantage in buying from the external supplier. The relevant comparison in such a 
situation is between the variable cost of £80 and the external price of £100.
I would also advise the company that non-financial matters such as quality control and
reliability of supply should be taken into consideration when deciding on external purchase
rather than internal production.
20.7.5
In-house activity compared to bought-in services
In her ﬁnal example, Fiona describes a situation where a company was considering
buying in services rather than employing its own staff. Cost–volume–proﬁt analysis
implies that the decision should be based on the costs saved by not undertaking the
activity in-house (the variable costs and any ﬁxed costs that are avoidable) together
with the costs incurred in buying the product or service from an external supplier
(price multiplied by quantity purchased).
FIONA: A company had been employing its own legal department, comprising a qualified
solicitor and two assistants. The solicitor was about to retire and the company had to
decide whether to advertise for a replacement or to use a commercial law service as and
when required. There would be no redundancy costs in respect of the two assistants
because the younger one could be redeployed to a vacancy elsewhere in the organisation
and the other would continue to be required as the internal contact with the commercial
law service.
I showed the management that, because the commercial law service would charge on
an hourly basis, the costs to be compared were the variable costs per hour charged by 
the commercial service and the fixed costs per annum of the in-house solicitor’s salary. 
We compared the hourly charge rate of £400 with the solicitor’s salary of £60,000 and the
assistant’s salary of £36,000 and worked out that the break-even point would be 240 hours
of the commercial law service each year. If more than 240 hours are requested next year,
it would be worth continuing the in-house service.
20.7.6
Relevant costs
Throughout the examples above Fiona McTaggart has made use of the distinction
between fixed and variable costs. She has also distinguished relevant from non-
relevant costs. Generally the ﬁxed costs have not been relevant to decision making 
but the variable costs have been relevant. Some ﬁxed costs are relevant where they
may be avoided by a speciﬁc course of action but others are not relevant because they
may not be avoided.
Definition
Relevant costs are those future costs which will be affected by a decision to be taken.
Non-relevant costs will not be affected by the decision.

20.8 Pricing decisions
One of the most important decisions taken by a business is that of pricing its product.
If the price is too high, there will be no demand. If the price is too low, the organisation
will be making a lower proﬁt than could be achieved.
20.8.1
Economic factors affecting pricing
The method of arriving at a price depends on economic factors. If the business has a
monopoly position (where one supplier has control of the market), it will be able to
dictate its own price. However, the higher the price, the greater the attraction to
incomers to break down the monopoly powers in seeking to share the beneﬁts enjoyed
by the monopolist.
Where the business is a market leader, it may be able to set its price by reference 
to covering its full costs and making a satisfactory proﬁt. If there are only a few large
sellers, each with a signiﬁcant share of the market, the situation is described as an
oligopoly. These few large sellers may compete with each other on price or they may
prefer to set their prices at a level which covers all costs and to keep the price reason-
ably constant while competing on non-price factors such as quality of the product.
In a perfectly competitive market, no one supplier is in a position to dictate prices.
Economic theory shows that the optimal price will be achieved where marginal 
cost equals marginal revenue. In other words, the additional cost of producing one
more item of output equals the additional revenue obtained by selling that item. While
the additional revenue exceeds the additional cost, the economist argues that it is
worth producing more. When the additional revenue is less than the additional cost,
production will not take place in the perfectly competitive market.
Pricing policy therefore depends primarily on the circumstances of the business. 
In many situations there is strong competition and the organisation must accept 
the market price and try to maximise its proﬁt by controlling cost. In that situation, the
most efﬁcient organisation will achieve the highest proﬁt as a percentage of sales.
Sometimes the organisation may be faced with pressure from customers to reduce 
selling price. The decision to do so will require an evaluation of the lower price 
against costs. In other cases, the organisation may have some ability to control price
and therefore has to decide on a price related to what the market will bear and related
to covering its costs.
There are therefore some situations in which a cost-based pricing formula may be
appropriate. These are now considered.
20.8.2
Full cost pricing
Full cost pricing is also called cost-plus pricing. The manager who is setting the price
for goods or services calculates the total cost per unit of output and adds a percentage
to that cost called the percentage mark-up on cost.
Calculation of total cost requires allocation of overhead costs. It was shown in
Chapter 18 that there is more than one method of allocating production overhead
costs. The same variety of method may be found in allocation of non-production over-
head. Different organisations will have different ideas on which costs they want to
cover in a cost-based pricing approach. What really matters is that the organisation
understands its cost structure and ensures that all overhead costs are covered in some
way by revenue in the longer term.
When the company is a price taker and is asked to take a lower price, or not to raise
its existing price, then cost-plus pricing is still important, but it is also important for

Chapter 20 Break-even analysis and short-term decision making
565
the organisation to ensure that it makes a decision using relevant costs. If the pricing
decision is based on a short-term perspective, then the organisation may decide to
accept any price provided that the additional revenue covers the variable costs. That
is the accountant’s version of the economist’s rule that marginal cost should equal
marginal revenue. In management accounting terms, the item should make a contri-
bution to ﬁxed costs but does not necessarily need to cover all ﬁxed costs. In the longer
term, the business must cover all costs, whether ﬁxed or variable, but it is possible that
some ﬁxed costs may be avoidable. If, for example, a reduced price is forced upon the
business, it may accept this in the short term but also take a long-term decision to cut
back on permanent staff and rental of premises. Such a decision may be unpleasant to
take, in terms of human consequences for staff, but may allow the business to survive
in a harsher economic situation.
20.8.3
Mark-up percentages
The full cost approach to pricing requires a percentage to be added to cost. Where does
this percentage come from? The answer is that it depends very much on the type of
business and the type of product. Where the market is competitive, mark-up percent-
ages will be low and the organisation relies for its success on a high volume of sales
activity. This may be seen in the operation of supermarkets, which charge lower prices
than the small shops and therefore have lower margins on the items sold, but cus-
tomers take away their purchases by the car load rather than in small parcels. In the
case of supermarket chains there is another aspect to pricing in that they themselves
buy from suppliers. The supermarkets may use the strength of their position to dictate
price terms to the suppliers, so that the margins are not as low as they would seem
from the prices charged to the customers.
In some industries, or for some products, there appears to be a ‘normal’ mark-up
which all companies apply fairly closely. This ‘normal’ mark-up may be so character-
istic that it is used by the auditor as a check on how reasonable the gross proﬁt amount
appears and is also used by the tax authorities as a check on whether all sales and
proﬁt are being declared for taxation purposes.
For those businesses which are in a position to apply cost-plus pricing, it may
encourage stability in the pricing structure because other businesses in the same
industry may be in a position to predict the behaviour of competitors. Companies 
in an industry will know the mix of variable and ﬁxed costs in the industry and 
will therefore have a good idea of how competitors’ proﬁts will be affected by a
change of price.
20.8.4
Limitations of full cost pricing
Full cost pricing, if used without sufﬁcient care, may not take into account the demand
for the product. A business may charge a proﬁt margin of 20% on sales when market
research could have shown that the potential customers would have accepted up to
25% as a proﬁt margin and still bought the goods or services.
Apportionment of ﬁxed costs is an arbitrary process, with more than one approach
being available. The proﬁt estimated using the cost-plus basis will depend on the
apportionment of ﬁxed costs. If the price is distorted by the costing process, an optimal
level of sales may not be achieved.
There may be a lack of beneﬁt to customers where businesses are able to set prices
on a cost-plus basis and, as a consequence, a group of companies works together to
‘agree’ a price. Such a situation is described in economics as a ‘cartel’, and in some 
situations a government will legislate against price ﬁxing by cartels because it creates
a monopoly position in a situation which appears at ﬁrst sight to be competitive.

Part 7 Decision making

20.8.5
Marginal cost pricing
Chapter 9 showed that, in the short term, a business may decide to accept a price that
is lower than full cost providing the price offered is greater than the variable cost, so
that there is a contribution to ﬁxed overhead costs. This reﬂects the economist’s pos-
ition that a business will continue to sell providing the marginal revenue exceeds the
marginal cost. It is therefore called marginal cost pricing. The most likely situation is
that a customer, knowing that the business has spare capacity, will offer a contract at
a reduced price to take up some of the spare capacity. The manager will accept the
offer provided there is a contribution to ﬁxed costs and proﬁts and providing no 
additional ﬁxed costs are incurred because of the extra contract.
Write down two products or services where the pricing might be based on cost plus a
percentage to cover profits. Write down two products or services where the prices are
determined in a highly competitive market. Write a short explanation (200 words) for 
an employee newsletter in a soap manufacturing business explaining why your product
price is always a few pence higher in the shops than that of other leading brands.
20.9 Summary
Key themes in this chapter are:
l The accountant’s view of cost behaviour differs from that of the economist. The
accountant assumes that total cost and total revenue vary on a straight-line basis 
as the volume of output and sales increases. The economist sees total cost varying
in a non-linear manner due to economies of scale and sees total revenue gradually
levelling off as customers reach the point where they do not wish to buy more of
the item.
l Contribution is deﬁned as sales minus variable cost. Contribution per unit is com-
pared with ﬁxed overhead cost to calculate break-even point. A break-even chart
and a proﬁt–volume chart are useful ways of showing how contribution and proﬁt
change as the volume of output and sales increases.
l Break-even analysis can be used to explore the effect of changing unit selling price,
unit variable cost or ﬁxed cost.
l Break-even analysis has limitations because it is only suitable for short-term decision
making and can only focus on one product at a time.
l A break-even chart is a graph that shows sales and costs over a range of activity,
including the activity level at which total costs equal total sales and at which the
business makes neither a proﬁt nor a loss.
l Cost–volume–profit analysis means comparing sales revenue with variable cost
and ﬁxed cost to calculate proﬁt or loss over a range of activity, to help with short-
term decision making.
l A profit–volume chart is a graph on which the horizontal axis shows the volume,
measured by activity level in £s of sales, and the vertical axis shows the proﬁt at that
activity level.
l The profit/volume ratio is calculated as contribution as a percentage of sales value:
l The calculation of contribution can be applied in the short-term for decisions such as:
– Decisions on special orders (does a lower price leave a positive contribution?)
– Abandonment decisions (is the product or service making a positive contribution?)

Chapter 20 Break-even analysis and short-term decision making
567
– Limiting factors (which product or service gives the highest contribution per unit
of limiting factor?)
– Make or buy (How does the price of the external product or service compare with
the internal variable cost and the ﬁxed overheads that will be saved?)
l Pricing decisions may be related to cost if the market accepts full cost pricing
(e.g. with a professional business where customers or clients seek out the personal
service).
l Pricing decisions may be related to marginal cost if there is heavy competition and
manufacturers take whatever price they can get in the market.

Problem solving and evaluation
C20.1 [S]
Dairyproducts Ltd has recently developed sales of cream in aerosol dispensers which are sold
alongside the company’s traditional products of cartons of cream and packets of cheese. The
company is now considering the sale of cream cheese in aerosol dispensers.
It is company policy that any new product must be capable of generating sufficient profit to
cover all costs, including estimated initial marketing and advertising expenditure of £1,000,000.
Current weekly production, with unit costs and selling prices, is as follows:
Units of 
Variable

Sales volume is equal to production volume. A 50-week trading year is assumed. Rates of
absorption of fixed costs are based on current levels of output.
In order to produce cream cheese in aerosol dispensers, the aerosol machine would require
modification at a cost of £400,000 which is to be recovered through sales within one year.
Additional annual fixed costs of £500,000 would be incurred in manufacturing the new product.
Variable cost of production would be 50 pence per can. Initial research has estimated demand
as follows:
Price per can (£)
Maximum weekly demand (cans)
1.50
60,000
1.40
80,000
1.15
100,000
There is adequate capacity on the aerosol machine, but the factory is operating near capacity
in other areas. The new product would have to be produced by reducing production elsewhere
and two alternatives have been identified:
(a) reduce production of cream cartons by 20% per annum; or
(b) reduce production of packet cheese by 25% per annum.
The directors consider that the new product must cover any loss of profit caused by this reduction
in volume. They are also aware that market research has shown growing customer dissatisfaction
because of wastage with cream sold in cartons.

Activities for study groups
Case 20.1
Leisure Furniture Ltd produces furniture for hotels and public houses using specific designs
prepared by firms of interior design consultants. Business is brisk and the market is highly com-
petitive with a number of rival companies tendering for work. The company’s pricing policy,
based on marginal costing (variable costing) techniques, is generating high sales.
The main activity of Home Furniture Ltd is the production of a limited range of standard lounge
suites for household use. The company also offers a service constructing furniture to customers’
designs. This work is undertaken to utilise any spare capacity. The main customers of the 
company are the major chains of furniture retailers. Due to recession, consumer spending on
household durables has decreased recently and, as a result, the company is experiencing a 
significant reduction in orders for its standard lounge suites. The market is unlikely to improve
within the next year. The company’s pricing policy is to add a percentage mark-up to total cost.
Required
Explain why different pricing policies may be appropriate in different circumstances, illustrating
your answer by reference to Leisure Furniture Ltd and Home Furniture Ltd.
Case 20.2
In groups of three, take the role of finance director, production director and sales director in a
company manufacturing pressure die castings, gravity die castings and sand castings. The
three types of casting are manufactured in different locations but each is no more than 20 miles
from either of the other locations. All castings are brought to central premises for finishing 
treatment. The costs of materials are around 56% of final sales price and the costs of labour
are around 30% of sales price.

Chapter 20 Break-even analysis and short-term decision making
571
The finance director has been asked to explain to the production director and the sales
director the effect of measuring profit using variable costing rather than absorption costing. It
is important to keep separate the profit on each of the three product types. The finance direc-
tor should provide a short explanation and the production director and sales director should ask
questions about anything which is unclear or omitted from the explanation. After the discussion
is completed (say, 30 minutes in all) the group should make a presentation to the class outlining
the nature of their discussion and the conclusion reached as to how profit for each product
should be measured.
Case 20.3
Your company manufactures furniture units to customers’ specifications. In groups of three,
take the role of sales director, production director and finance director. You have met to decide
on the price to be charged for each contract. The sales director aims to maximise revenue, the
finance director seeks to maximise profit and the production director wishes to continue 
operating at full capacity. Discuss the approach you will take to deciding the company’s 
pricing policy for the year ahead. Present to the rest of the class the arguments you will present
to the entire board of directors.

Durham Police Authority. Revenue
and Capital budgets 2012/13
Policing Priorities consultation:
During 14 November and 1 December 
2011 Durham Police Authority invited all
residents, organisations and groups in 
County Durham and Darlington to ‘have 
their say’ on policing and community safety
priorities for 2012/13. This was a joint
consultation with Durham Constabulary,
Darlington Community Safety Partnership 
and Safe Durham Partnership.
The Police Authority has given Durham
Constabulary the strategic direction to focus
on the top three priorities from the public
consultation, which are:
l tackling anti-social behaviour in 
partnership
l reducing the impact of alcohol abuse on
people and communities
l protecting vulnerable people from harm.
Whilst these are the top three priorities,
other issues will continue to be tackled such
as drug abuse, metal theft and burglary.
Both the Authority and the Constabulary
understand the importance of working in
partnership to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour issues that matter to our communities (page 5).

down from senior management with little or no consultation. A practical example is
explained in detail to show the preparation of a master budget. Calculations are also
shown for quarterly budgets.
21.2 Purpose and nature of a budget system
The purpose of a budget system is to serve the needs of management in respect of 
the judgements and decisions it is required to make and to provide a basis for the 
management functions of planning and control, described in Chapter 16. That chapter
also refers to the importance of communication and motivation as an aspect of 
management to which management accounting should contribute.
This chapter considers the purpose and nature of the budgetary process and explains
the method of preparation of budgets, with particular emphasis on the planning 
process. The use of budgets for control is touched upon in this chapter but elabor-
ated in more detail in Chapter 22. No two businesses will have an identical approach
to budget preparation. Some involve all employees in the process, while others deliver
the budget from senior management with little or no consultation. This chapter 
discusses systems where there is a relatively high degree of participation and nego-
tiation in setting budgets. It should be recognised that in some businesses the senior
managers will take decisions without such extensive consultation. A discussion of the 
relative merits of consultation are well beyond the scope of this book but in learning
about the budgetary process it may help the student to think about the ways in which
each person having responsibility for administering a budget might also have a part
to play in its construction.
In Figure 21.1 (later) there is an illustration of the interrelationships of these 
management functions in respect of the process by which a business such as a chain
of shops supplying motorcycles might go about planning to open a new shop in the
suburbs of a city. Where this type of planning is taking place, management account-
ing assists through a budget system by providing quantiﬁcation of each stage of the
planning process. That example of the motorcycle shop illustrates a simple type of
long-range planning situation but a more complex example would show the way in
which the long-range planning leads on to successively more detailed developments,
ﬁnishing with a collection of short-term operational budgets covering a period such as
a year, six months or perhaps no more than one month ahead.
21.2.1
Long-range planning
In long-range planning, the senior managers of a business will begin by specifying 
a mission statement which sets out in the broadest terms their vision of the future
direction of the organisation. Based on this mission statement the senior managers will
then prepare a list of objectives which will specify the intended future growth and
development of the business. For example, a company might state its mission and its
long-range corporate objectives, for a ﬁve-year period ahead, in the terms shown in
Exhibit 21.1.
The corporate objectives shown in Exhibit 21.1 relate to the business as a whole. They
will then be taken down to another level of detail to create objectives for each division
of the business. Within divisions, they will be translated into departmental objectives.
21.2.2
Strategy
Having a mission statement and corporate objectives is an essential ﬁrst step, but 
the organisation must then decide exactly how it will achieve those objectives. The

Part 8 Planning and control
578
term strategy is used to describe the courses of action to be taken in achieving the
objectives set.
Developing the strategy will involve senior management from the various func-
tions such as marketing, customer service, production, personnel and ﬁnance. These
functions are separate but must work together in the interests of the company as a
whole. Each functional manager has to understand how the plans made by that func-
tion will affect other functions and the company as a whole. This requires communi-
cation and co-ordination with the assistance of a management accountant.
For the purposes of quantifying the strategy of the business, management accounting
has developed specialist techniques under the global heading of budgetary planning
and control. The rest of this chapter explains the processes involved.
21.2.3
Budgets
Definition
A budget is a detailed plan which sets out, in money terms, the plans for income and
expenditure in respect of a future period of time. It is prepared in advance of that time
period and is based on the agreed objectives for that period of time, together with the
strategy planned to achieve those objectives.
Each separate function of the organisation will have its own budget. Figure 21.1
shows a typical scheme of budget structure within an organisation. It shows how the
organisation moves from setting objectives, through the strategy stage and into the
preparation of budgets. The long-term objectives are set ﬁrst. It is important to note at
that stage any key assumptions which might have a critical effect on future imple-
mentation of those objectives. The implementation of those long-term objectives is
then formed into a strategy which results in some intermediate objectives for the short
term. Again it is important to note any key assumptions which might later cause the
organisation to question the objectives. In many businesses the critical factor deter-
mining all other budgets is the sales forecast. The business exists primarily to make
sales and hence generate proﬁt, so each separate function will be working towards
that major target. Each function of the business then prepares its own budget as a
statement of its operational plan for achieving the targets that have been set.
In practice these budgets would be prepared at the same time with a great deal of
interaction among the managers of the various functions. That is difﬁcult to show in 
a diagram. Figure 21.1 shows only the main budget relationships, moving from the

sales forecast to the production plan and the resulting working capital needs (stock,
debtors and trade creditors) and capital investment in ﬁxed assets. The various detailed
budgets are brought together within a ﬁnance plan and then formed into conventional
accounting statements such as budgeted proﬁt and loss account, cash ﬂow statement
and balance sheet. This package is sometimes referred to as the master budget. The
process leading to the preparation of the master budget, as outlined in Figure 21.1, will
be used in the next section of this chapter as a basis for explaining the administration
of the budgeting process.

Imagine you are the managing director of a large company about to embark on budget
preparation for the following year. How would you manage the various people you 
would need to meet in order to make operational the budget relationships shown in
Figure 21.1? Would you meet them all together or have separate meetings? Would you
take sole charge or would you establish teams? Write down your thoughts on this before
you read the next section and then check it against your ideas.
21.3 Administration of the budgetary process
The budgetary process has to be administered effectively in terms of initial planning,
ﬁnal approval and subsequent monitoring of implementation. A budget committee is
usually formed to manage each stage of the budgetary process. The accounting staff
will have a close involvement. The budget preparation procedures will need to be 
set out in a manual which is available to all participants. A continuing cycle evolves 
in which initial budgets are prepared, negotiations take place with line managers, the
initial budgets are revised, the ﬁnal budget is accepted and, later on, there is a review
of actual and budgeted performance. The cycle then starts over again.
21.3.1
The budget committee
To implement the strategy decisions, a budget committee will be formed, comprising
the senior managers who are responsible for designing the strategy. The budget com-
mittee receives the initial budgets from each functional manager. If the initial budget
is based on unrealistic targets, then the functional manager will be asked to modify 
the budget within the organisation’s overall targets. There is a motivational aspect of 
budget preparation, so it is important that the functional manager understands the
need for revising the budget within the organisation’s strategy. Budget negotiation
can be quite a delicate process.
Fiona McTaggart describes her experiences of the initial budget formation in a 
conglomerate company having a stock exchange listing:
FIONA: There are four divisions whose activities are quite dissimilar but the linking theme is
their ability to generate cash for the group which, in turn, is translated into dividends for
the shareholders and capital investment for the divisions. The budget committee is formed
from the board of directors of the holding company. Budget negotiations start each year
when each divisional manager sets targets in six critical areas: capital expenditure, turnover,
gross and net profit margins, cash flow and working capital requirements.
The budget committee knows over the years that the transport division manager is always
too enthusiastic for capital expenditure and has to be persuaded to be more cautious in
replacing and expanding the fleet.
The musical instrument division is on a steady-state pattern without much growth, but
is regarded as a steady source of cash flow, so is not encouraged to be more ambitious.
The knitwear division has some problems associated with fashion goods and tends to
be too conservative in its planning. A measure of risk-taking is encouraged and almost
every year that division has to be asked to revise its initial turnover targets upwards.
The fourth division is stationery supplies and their problem is profit targets in a 
competitive sector. Little can be done about gross profit, but there is plenty of scope for
cost efficiencies to improve the contribution of net profit to cash flow.
21.3.2
The accounting department
The staff of the accounting department do not initiate the preparation of budgets but
will be assisting in the practical aspects of budget preparation. They should have the

Chapter 21 Preparing a budget
581
knowledge and experience to provide advice to line managers on the preparation of
budgets. The accounting department will have the computer facilities to prepare and
co-ordinate the budget preparation process.
21.3.3
Sequence of the budgetary process
Figure 21.1 shows the relationships among the various budgets but does not portray
the time sequence of the budgeting process. The principal stages of this sequence are:
1 communicate the details of objectives and strategy to those responsible for prep-
aration of budgets;
2 communicate the details of budget preparation procedures to those responsible for
preparation of budgets;
3 determine the limiting factor which restricts overall budget ﬂexibility and forms the
focus of the budget cascade;
4 prepare an initial set of budgets;
5 negotiate budgets with line managers;
6 co-ordinate and review budgets;
7 accept budgets in ﬁnal form;
8 carry out ongoing review of budgets as they are implemented.
Communicate objectives and strategy
The long-range plan should be contained in a strategy document which is circulated
within the organisation at intervals throughout the year. Regular circulation, with
invitations to comment and a visible process of revision to accommodate changing 
circumstances, means that those responsible for the preparation of budgets have the
fullest understanding of the basis for the budget process. The strategy document
should contain clear narrative descriptions of the objectives of the organisation, supple-
mented by quantiﬁed illustrations of the impact on the organisation as a whole and 
on major divisions. The objectives may initially be expressed in non-ﬁnancial terms
such as production or sales targets by volume, or workforce targets by quantity and
quality. Ultimately, all these non-ﬁnancial targets will have a ﬁnancial implication.
Communicate procedures
For communication of budget preparation procedures within the organisation there
must be a budget manual. This will set out the timetable for budget preparation, 
formats to be used, circulation lists for drafts and arbitration procedures where conﬂicts
begin to show themselves.
Determine the limiting factor
For many organisations, sales are the limiting factor. There is no point in producing
goods and services which do not sell. There may be occasions when the demand is 
not a problem but the supply of materials or labour resources is restricted. (Such
restrictions on production factors should be temporary in a competitive market
because materials will eventually be found at a higher price, while labour will move
from one geographical area to another or will train to develop new skills within the
area.) Whatever the limiting factor, it must determine the starting point of the 
budgeting process. For this chapter it will be assumed that sales are the limiting factor.
That assumption is the basis of the chart of budget relationships shown in Figure 21.1
where the cascade ﬂows down from the top to the foot of the page.
Preparing an initial set of budgets
The sales budget is a representation of the volume of sales planned for the budget
period, multiplied by the expected selling price of each item. For most organisations,

Part 8 Planning and control
582
sales volume is the major unknown item because it depends on customers whose
choices may be difﬁcult to predict. In practice an organisation will carry out some
form of market research, ranging from very sophisticated market research surveys to
some simple but effective techniques such as contacting past customers and asking
them about their intentions for the period ahead. Sales representatives will, as part of
their work, form continuous estimates of demand in their region of responsibility. Past
performance in sales may usefully be analysed to identify trends which may be an
indicator of future success in sales.
From the sales plan ﬂow the operational budgets. Figure 21.1 shows the sub-
sequent pattern of budget development once the sales budget has been determined. The
production plan, setting out quantities of resource inputs required, leads into oper-
ational budgets for direct labour, direct materials and manufacturing overhead which
combine resource quantities with expected price per unit. At the same time budgets
for administration and marketing are being prepared based on quantities and prices
of resources needed for production and sales.
That information provides the basis for a proﬁt and loss account matching sales and
expenses. A cash ﬂow estimate is also required based upon working capital needs and
ﬁxed asset needs. Working capital depends on the mix of stock, debtors and creditors
planned to support the sales and production levels expected. Fixed asset needs derive
from the capital projects budgeted as a result of the objectives of the organisation.
This all feeds into a ﬁnance plan from which the master budget emerges containing
the budgeted proﬁt and loss account, the budgeted cash ﬂow statement and the 
budgeted balance sheet.
Negotiate budgets with line managers
The success of the budgetary process is widely held to depend on the extent to which
all participants are involved in the budget preparation process. The budgets will be
initiated in each of the departments or areas responsible but each budget may have 
an impact on other line managers. There may be a problem of restricted resources
which requires all budgets to be cut back from initial expectations. There may be a 
programme of expansion which has not been taken sufﬁciently into account by those
preparing the budgets. Whatever the particular circumstances, a negotiation stage 
will be required which will usually involve the budget committee in discussions with
various line managers. At the very least this will be a communications exercise so that
each participant understands the overall position. More often it will be an opportunity
for ﬁne-tuning the plans so that the beneﬁt to the organisation as a whole is maximised.
Although Figure 21.1 is presented as a downward-ﬂowing cascade because of the
increasing level of detail involved, it does not adequately represent the negotiation
processes involved. Figure 21.2 is a different way of showing the budgetary process
outlined in Figure 21.1. It emphasises people rather than the documentation resulting
from the process, and also shows the combination of what is sometimes described as
the ‘bottom-up’ preparation of budgets with the ‘top-down’ approval by senior man-
agement. In Figure 21.2, the black and pink lines show some of the interactions which
might take place in the negotiation stage, distinguishing negotiations among the line
managers (black lines) and negotiations between the line managers and the budget
committee (pink lines). Quite deliberately, the lines are shown without directional
arrows because the negotiation process is two-way. Even then a two-dimensional
diagram cannot do justice to the time span and the sequence of negotiations over a 
relatively short space of time.
Co-ordinate and review budgets
Participants in each separate negotiation will reach a point where they are satisﬁed
with the discussion, or else they understand where and why their opinions differ.

Chapter 21 Preparing a budget
583
However, the budget committee has an obligation to serve the interests of the organ-
isation as a whole. The separate budgets resulting from the negotiation process are
brought together in a meeting of the budget committee. At this meeting the separate
budgets are co-ordinated. If the sales manager has budgeted for a 10% expansion in
the volume of sales in the coming year, while the production director has budgeted for
steady-state levels of production, then this co-ordination exercise will show a poten-
tial reduction in stock levels. This may be acceptable in the circumstances, but the 
risks of inadequate stock levels must be added to the planning considerations. If the
production director has budgeted for a change in employee grade which will increase 
the wages cost but the ﬁnance director has planned for a ‘freeze’ on payroll costs, the
co-ordination exercise may result in one or the other budget giving way.
Co-ordination will involve examining all the separate budgets in terms of how well
they serve the objectives and strategy deﬁned at the outset. Review could take a variety
of forms. The budget committee might review the budgets for reasonableness by com-
paring them with the budgets for the previous year and the outcome of that year. The
review might concentrate on the effective use of cash. It might link the budget requests
to indicators of performance. For example, there might be a view that departments
that have performed well should receive even greater budgets to support this high
performance. On the other hand, there might be a view that a department that has
Figure 21.2
The negotiating aspects of budget planning

Part 8 Planning and control
584
Activity 21.2
failed to perform to expectations needs greater budgets to support a catching-up 
exercise. Co-ordination and review may lead to a further round of negotiation in order
to arrive at the best position for the entity as a whole.
Accept the budgets in final form
At the end of the negotiation period it will be necessary for the budget committee to
approve and accept a deﬁnitive set of budgets which will set out the organisation’s
plan for the period ahead. It is possible that, as a result of the negotiation stage, some
managers will feel more satisﬁed than others. A good system of budget setting will by
this stage have ensured that all managers, whether disappointed or not, understand
the reasoning and understand what is expected in their area of responsibility.
Ongoing review
The budget process is not an end in itself. It is a formal process of planning which
guides subsequent action. Monitoring that subsequent action against the budget plan
is therefore an essential follow-up to the budget process. An organisation might decide
that monthly monitoring of progress against budget is adequate for control purposes
and for contributing to future planning.
Within the control function, monthly monitoring of the actual outcome against the
budget will allow corrective action to be taken at the earliest opportunity, although
care is required in this respect. It could be that conditions have changed since the budget
was set and the actual outcome is a better representation than the budget. In such a case
it might even be appropriate to revise the budget in line with the changed conditions.
Budgeting is a continuous process which requires adaptation of existing budgets
where a need for change is indicated, and the consideration of performance against
past budgets when the next round of budget preparation begins. The budget committee
is therefore active the whole year around.
Write down five ways in which budgets appear to benefit an organisation. Then read 
the next section. How does your list compare with the text? Have you identified benefits
additional to those described? Have you used different words to describe a benefit which
is in the text?
21.4 The benefits of budgeting
The budgetary process contributes to effective management in the following areas:
planning, control, communication and co-ordination and performance evaluation.
Each of these areas is now considered in turn.
21.4.1
Planning
The preparation of budgets forces management to carry out a formal planning exercise
which identiﬁes every part of the organisation and brings the separate parts together on
a quantiﬁed basis. Major planning decisions are made as part of the long-term planning
process, and these are then reﬁned into progressively greater detail as management
turn them into short-term operational plans. A formal planning process encourages all
parts of the organisation to contribute on a regular basis to the formation of the over-
all plan and to identify potential difﬁculties at an early stage. Here is Fiona McTaggart
to describe the budget planning process in a major multinational company.
FIONA: I once participated in the planning process within a major international oil company.
The financial year ran from January to December. The company’s head office was in Brussels,
with operational centres around the world. I was working in one of the UK operational 

Chapter 21 Preparing a budget
585
centres, seeing the process from part-way along the chain. A company strategy group,
comprising the senior management from head office and the operational centres, would
form a rolling five-year statement of objectives. Having a rolling plan means that the com-
pany always looks to the next five years, but each January the rolling plan is reviewed, the
current year is deleted and the fifth year ahead is added.
The effect is that the rolling five-year plan is updated every January in respect of the 
five-year period starting the following January. That means the company has 12 months in
which to prepare its operational budgets for the one year starting in the following January.
Preparation of the five-year plan is described as Stage A. Each operational centre around
the world then has two months to come back to head office with the results of its one-year
budgeting, described as Stage B.
Stage B involves each operational centre specifying how the implementation of the five-
year plan will be carried out for one year ahead within the operational centre, bringing out
a master budget of quarterly cash flows and profit. At that stage they don’t produce the
detailed operational budgets within the operational centre, but each centre will have consulted
with its various managers as to the way in which their departmental objectives for one year
ahead will mesh with the five-year plan from head office and from the operational centre.
Stage C lasts one month and allows some fine-tuning of the five-year plan, by the head
office, in the light of the reaction from the operational centres. That takes matters up to the
end of June, and after that point there is little further opportunity for change in the five-year
plan, or in the one-year targets of each operational centre, short of a major change in 
circumstances in the company or in the industry.
Stage D lasts four months and involves detailed budget planning within each operational
centre. That will be an iterative process, where each manager of an operational unit pro-
duces a draft budget covering a 12-month period, the draft budgets are collected together,
an overall view is taken and the draft budgets go back to the managers for revision.
Everything is tidied up by the end of October and then there are two months left to put
the documentation together so that budgets are ready for implementation from the start of
the next year in January.
Meanwhile, the senior managers in Brussels will have started, in October, their deliber-
ations with a view to revising the rolling five-year plan in the following January. Then the
whole process starts over again!
21.4.2
Control
Once the budget is in place, implementation of the organisation’s plans takes place and
the actual outcome may be compared against the budget. Some revenues and costs
will behave according to expectations, but some will not. Attention needs to be given
to the items which are not meeting expectations. Having a budget as a basis for compari-
son allows management to identify the exceptions which require attention. Identifying
such matters at an early stage allows corrective action to be taken to remedy the problem.
Differences between the actual outcomes and budget expectations may signal the
need for urgent action by the managers or the need for revisions to the budget. If the
budget differences arise from factors under the control of the line managers, then
urgent action may be required to rectify the causes of those differences. However, if
the budget differences are the result of unforeseen or uncontrollable factors, then the
need is for modiﬁcation of the budget.
Here is Fiona to continue her story.
FIONA: I’ve told you how the oil company produces its budgets for the year ahead. From
January of each year the actual out-turn of the operations has to be compared against the
budget. That is where the problems really start, because the oil industry is at the high end
of the uncertainty spectrum. The price of oil is controlled in world markets and influenced
by world events well beyond the power of any company. A threat of war in some far-away
country which borders on the main shipping lanes will send the price of oil up but threaten

Part 8 Planning and control
586
supplies for individual production companies seeking to take advantage of the price rise.
Recession in developed countries will lower the demand and hence lower the price, so that
companies have oil in the ground but may as well leave it there if demand has disappeared.
These major changes occur on a short-term basis and may cause the short-term plans to
require urgent change.
It would not be feasible to return to the five-year plan every month because of a crisis,
so the operational centres have to adapt to change. A few years ago, the operational centres
did nothing to amend the budgets after they had been finalised. The consequence was that
the budgets grew increasingly irrelevant to reality as the year progressed. As a result, the
operational managers largely ignored the budgets and set their own unofficial targets in
operational terms without having regard to the precise financial implications.
Senior management realised that this bypassing of the management accounting budgets
was linked to a lack of awareness of cost control, vital to a business which has little control
over its selling prices. So a quarterly revision process was devised whereby the operational
centre is allowed to revise the budgets to keep them relevant to changing circumstances.
This may lead to a deviation from the five-year plan set at the start of the year, but the view
is that the increased relevance to operational practice is more important than the deviation
from the plan. Of course, information about the revision is fed back to head office as input
to the next round of five-year planning.
It seems to be working, and the managers at the operational level, such as platform
supervisors and supply service managers, now use their quarterly budgets as a basis for
explaining how they control costs for which they are responsible. There is also a benefit to
the five-year planning exercise because indications of change are fed in during the year
and the long-term exercise itself is becoming smoother.
21.4.3
Communication and co-ordination
In Chapter 16 there is an organisation chart (Figure 16.1) which shows line relation-
ships and horizontal relationships where effective communications are essential. Lines
of communication ensure that all parts of the organisation are kept fully informed of
the plans and of the policies and constraints within which those plans are formed.
Fiona continues with her experiences in an oil company.
FIONA: One of the major problems of any large organisation is to encourage communi-
cation and co-ordination within the separate parts of the entity. The oil company is organised
into divisions based on the six different exploration fields. Sometimes those different 
fields appear to regard themselves as self-contained units with no other relationships. It is
important to overcome this insularity by skilful use of communication and co-ordination.
The process of communication and co-ordination starts with the early stages of the budget
planning process when each divisional head is required to review the plans for the division
in the context of the other five divisions. Targets set within the budget are comparable
across the divisions, but there is an allowance for the relative exploration difficulty. That
first stage of review may encourage a self-centred attitude of protecting the division’s 
interests, but it does at least encourage a wider awareness of global targets.
The communication process continues when detailed budget plans are prepared.
Divisional heads attend monthly meetings when the budget planning team sets out the
main features of the budgets. That allows one-to-one communication and creates an
awareness of the possibilities of mutual savings by co-ordination. As one small example, a
helicopter might be leaving the airport to take supplies out to a rig. The return trip could
usefully be turned into a full payload by calling at a rig on a nearby field on the way back.
That requires some co-ordination but could halve the overall flight cost for each field.
The control stage encourages further awareness of the need for co-ordination when the
actual costs are compared with the budget. Each divisional head receives an exception
report showing costs which are running over budget, and there is a system of marking cost
headings where co-ordination could reduce overall costs. A commentary section attached

Chapter 21 Preparing a budget
587
Activity 21.3
to the exception report gives the divisional head guidance as to where co-ordination might
usefully be applied.
21.4.4
Basis for performance evaluation
Performance evaluation within organisations must sooner or later be taken to the stage
of detail which requires evaluation of the performance of individuals working within the
organisation. In some situations there will be a monetary reward for high performance
standards, in terms of bonus payments and possibly promotion. There may be penalties
for underperforming, the most drastic of which is to be dismissed from the post. Apart
from the organisation’s needs to evaluate the performance of those working within the
organisation, there is also an individual’s need for self-assessment. Whatever the type
of performance evaluation of the individual or group of individuals, targets must be set
in advance which are known to, and understood by, all participants. The budgetary
process forms a systematic basis for setting performance targets in ﬁnancial terms.
The ﬁnancial targets may then have to be translated into non-ﬁnancial targets (such
as number of items produced per week, or frequency of corrective work, or number 
of administrative tasks undertaken) because the person concerned will identify more
readily with the non-ﬁnancial performance measure. The subject of non-ﬁnancial 
performance measures is explored further in Chapter 23.
Write down five ways in which budgeting may cause problems for an organisation. Then
read the next section and compare your list with the text. Have you found additional
problems? Are the problems you have identified more serious or less serious than those
described in the text?
21.5 Behavioural aspects of budgeting
So far this chapter has presented what is largely conventional wisdom as to the desir-
ability of, and a systematic approach to, the setting of budgets. In real life, things are
not always so simple. We now move on to look at two potential problems, namely the
behavioural aspects of budgeting and the limitations of line item budgets.
The earlier description of the technical process of setting a budget emphasised the
need for involvement at all stages of the process. In an ideal world that would produce
the best solution, but the world is not ideal and not everyone can be allowed to do
exactly as they would wish at the ﬁrst instance. So potential conﬂicts arise and those
involved in the budgetary process need to be aware of the behavioural aspects in order
to maximise the good points and minimise the problems.
The behavioural aspects may conveniently be summarised as relating to motivation,
participation, feedback, group effects, budget slack and the politics of the organis-
ation. In each of these areas there has been research into the effects, sometimes with
inconclusive results. This chapter does not seek to give detailed reference to the
research work, but rather to bring out some of the ﬁndings as points to consider in
relation to the technical process.
21.5.1
Motivation
It was suggested earlier in this chapter that budgets should help in performance 
evaluation because they provide formal targets against which to measure perform-
ance. If the targets are set with care, there should be motivation for the individual to
achieve those targets. The question then arises as to what type of targets should be set.
Relatively easy targets will be achieved by all, but they will know the targets were
easy and will not feel fully motivated by that level of evaluation of performance. 

Part 8 Planning and control
588
If the targets are moderately difﬁcult there will be a stronger motivation for some 
individuals to achieve those targets, with a sense of personal satisfaction in doing so.
Others will fail and will become despondent. They may decide not to put any further
effort in because the targets are too difﬁcult.
The literature on goal setting suggests that it is important that the budget targets are
accepted by the individuals involved. In that context, budget targets should be at the
‘difﬁcult’ end of the range, by way of creating a challenge, but should be seen as being
attainable. If budget targets are unrealistic there may be a negative reaction where the
individual does not even attempt a reasonable level of performance. Communication
between levels in the organisation is also important, so that the individual knows that
achievement of targets is reported at a higher level and recognised in some form.
Within all these considerations of positive factors of motivation, there may be person-
ality problems which invalidate approaches which would otherwise be successful.
21.5.2
Participation
A full understanding of the behavioural aspects of the budgetary process requires 
an understanding of psychology. Research into behavioural aspects of budgeting 
has therefore included psychological studies of the individuals participating in the
budgetary process. It is argued that individuals have needs for a sense of belonging, a
sense of self-esteem and a sense of personal fulﬁlment. These needs do not necessarily
have to be provided through remunerated employment or self-employment. They
could be achieved through charitable work or dedication to a particular way of life. To
the extent that people do spend a considerable part of their lives in paid employment,
these needs may most readily be satisﬁed by that work.
Participation is one way of meeting those needs, and therefore participation in the
budgetary process is a signiﬁcant aspect of meeting human needs. Those individuals
who participate in the budgetary process will gain a sense of ownership of the process,
or belonging to the process. They will experience an increase in self-esteem through
having a deﬁned role in the process and will achieve a sense of personal fulﬁlment
through successful implementation of the budget plans.
21.5.3
Feedback
Feedback on actual performance, as compared with the budget, is an essential part of
the control process which follows from the setting of the budgets. Feedback is only
effective if it is provided in a short time frame. Good news is preferred to bad news;
individuals may thus concentrate on the positive feedback and hope that the negative
feedback will disappear. The information on negative feedback may have to be 
presented in a constructive manner if it is to result in action. For example, ‘Sales this
month were 10% down’ may be seen as a negative aspect about which little can be done
after the event, but a statement such as ‘Next month’s sales effort must take account
of the cause of last month’s 10% decrease’ requires positive action in identifying and
seeking to remedy the cause of the decrease.
Feedback must relate closely to the responsibility level of the individual if it is to
encourage remedial action. There may be a personality problem here, as elsewhere, 
if individuals see the feedback as criticism of their work. That adverse reaction to 
criticism could be a function of age or insecurity. Negative aspects of feedback may
need a different form of communication from that needed for positive aspects.
21.5.4
Group effects
The impact of the budgetary process on a group of persons may be quite different
from the impact on the individual within the group. Participation by individuals will
lead to greater group interaction, which will be a good thing if the individuals value

Chapter 21 Preparing a budget
589
their membership of the group and see the goals of the group as being collective 
targets that they all regard as desirable. Such a group will show cohesion, which will
be increased by participation in the budget process.
Where a group does not have such cohesion, or the majority pressure is towards
lower targets, the performance of the individual may be reduced by participation
within the group. It may therefore be important for senior management, wishing to
make effective use of the budgetary process, to have careful regard for the compo-
sition of groups within the organisation.
21.5.5
Budget slack
Where budgets are used to measure performance, the managers who set those budgets
may be tempted to build in some element of spare resources that allows a lapse from
actual high levels of performance without deviating from budget targets. The element
of spare resources could involve overestimating the time required for any particular
task, or using the highest price of input materials available in the price list, or asking
for more equipment than is strictly necessary. Quite apart from such deliberate 
creation of slack there could also be unintentional errors such as planning activity 
for 52 weeks in the year when the premises are only open for 50 weeks.
The use of such bias at a lower level of budget preparation may be countered by a
correspondingly strict attitude at a higher level to compensate for the built-in slack.
That could be unfortunate for the lower-level manager who does not build in slack 
but is penalised along with the rest. The answer to this problem is that the process of
budget setting should be speciﬁc as to input information so that built-in slack is
identiﬁed at the earliest possible stage. Flexibility in budgeting is also important to
ensure that where slack does become evident it is dealt with by budget revision.
21.5.6
Politics of the organisation
Irrespective of the type of entity, it is almost inevitable that there will be a political aspect
to its management structure. The word ‘politics’ here refers to the power struggle within
the organisation. It might be a power struggle in which labour unions seek to impose
their will on management. It might be a power struggle within the board of directors
or between divisions of the enterprise. Whatever its nature, such a power struggle is
evidenced in the budget process where various units of the enterprise are engaged in
rivalry over the formulation of the budget. Thus the budgetary process may be more
important as a manifestation of the political struggle than as an item of ﬁnancial planning.
There may be two aspects to budgeting: the public image of resource allocation, 
and the private image of resolving conﬂict. For the purposes of this book we will con-
centrate on the technicalities of providing information for resource allocation, but the
other potential aspects should not be ignored entirely. They form a signiﬁcant element
of more advanced study in management accounting.
21.6 Approaches to budgeting
This section contrasts input-based and output-based budget systems.
21.6.1
Input-based budget systems
The budgetary process described in this chapter has focused on the separate items
which contribute to the overall budget. There will be a line for each item, such as 
direct materials, direct labour, various kinds of production overhead, various kinds 
of administration and selling and distribution costs. That type of budget is called a 
line item budget. The line item budget concentrates on the inputs to the process.

Part 8 Planning and control
590
As an example, in the National Health Service the hospital services and support
facilities are provided by NHS Trusts, each covering a geographical area. The Trusts
must plan their budgets with regard for the objectives set by the government. As an
example, Exhibit 21.2 sets out the ﬁnancial objectives for one Trust.
Exhibit 21.2
Financial objectives for an NHS Trust
1 Taking one financial year with another, to ensure that a balance is maintained
between income available to the Trust and expenditure properly chargeable
against that income.
2 To achieve a surplus before interest of 6% on average net assets.
The budget shown in Table 21.1 fails by £2m to meet the required surplus. Since
there is another target of maintaining a balance taking one year with another, we
would now ask whether the previous year also fell below the required standard. If the
trend was towards continuing a deﬁcit there would be some concern.
21.6.2
Output-based budget systems
It would be equally valid to approach the budgetary process from a totally different
direction and concentrate on outputs from the process. An output-based approach
could be taken by any organisation, but the greatest extent of its practical application
has been observed in the non-proﬁt-making organisations, where their activity output
is the most important focus of their work.
An output-based approach to budgeting requires starting with an estimate of the
quantity and quality of service to be provided. For the non-proﬁt-making organisation
the service output takes the place of sales for the proﬁt-seeking organisation. Having
deﬁned the desired output the organisation then budgets to determine what will be
required to achieve that output. If the organisation is a charity, it will then set about
fund-raising. If it is central or local government, it will levy taxes. If the charitable
funds available, or the tax revenues to be generated, do not meet all the requirements,
then the output activities may be curtailed.

Such an output-based approach focuses on programmes of action. Various bud-
geting techniques have been suggested for dealing with output-based budgets. Two 
such techniques are planning, programming budgeting systems (PPBS) and zero-base
budgeting (ZBB).
Planning, programming budgeting systems
Planning, programming budgeting systems (PPBS) is an approach that seeks to 
separate the policy planning aspects of budgeting from the short-term ﬁnancial 
planning process. From the overall objectives, the organisation moves on to identify
the programmes which will achieve those objectives. The costs and beneﬁts of each
programme are then identiﬁed so that the programmes may be given relative priorities.
Subjective judgement is required to select the most suitable programmes for imple-
mentation and the resources required are then allocated to those programmes.
The techniques of PPBS were advocated with enthusiasm in the USA for govern-
ment budgeting in the 1970s, but by the 1980s had disappeared from favour. The 
reason was that although the system sounds ideal, it is very difﬁcult to administer
because government departments are not organised by outcomes; they are organised
on an input basis. In the late 1990s the state of Florida began new attempts to use 
programme budgets, with a focus on performance. As an example, the Department 
of Children and Family Services proposed programmes around speciﬁc groups such
as persons with mental health problems. The agency then focused on achievement
targets such as improving mental health, rather than on input targets such as pro-
viding speciﬁc hours of consultation. It was difﬁcult to plan budgets forward on a 
programme basis because of the lack of adequately robust unit cost information. 
The budgets were mainly used as quantiﬁed conﬁrmation that targets had remained
within funding limits.
A programme to integrate into the community patients who have suffered mental
illness may be taken as an example of PPBS. Such a programme will require the estab-
lishment of houses where the former patients may enjoy a degree of independence but
will have access to help should it be required. That will involve a social welfare aspect
and will increase the burden on the budget of the social services. The hospitals will
have fewer long-stay mental patients and so will be able to close psychiatric wards.
The health service will regard the corresponding funding as being released for other
health service purposes such as acute medical care. Thus a programme which might
be seen as having a positive social outcome may not result in a mutually amicable
budgetary process where the two input departments are not under any constraint to
work in harmony on achieving the overall objective.
The fact that PPBS has not worked effectively in a government budgeting context
may be due more to the organisation of government departments than to any intrinsic
weakness in the concept. If the organisation’s objectives are set in terms of pro-
grammes, then the organisational structure needs to reﬂect those programmes or it
risks being ineffective if employees relate more closely to their input function than to
the deﬁned outputs.
Zero-based budgeting
Zero-base budgeting (ZBB) was devised as a reaction to the traditional incremental
approach to budgeting. That traditional approach favoured starting with the previous
year’s expenditure budget, adding a percentage to cover inﬂation and making adjust-
ment for any unusual factors or incremental changes. The success of the incremental
approach depended critically on the suitability of the previous year’s ﬁgures. Any
errors in estimation would continue indeﬁnitely.
Zero-base budgeting requires a completely clean sheet of paper every year. Each
part of the organisation has to justify over again the budget it requires. Some thought-
provoking questions may need to be answered, such as:

Activity 21.4
Part 8 Planning and control
592
l What is the need for this activity?
l How much of it is needed?
l Is there a more cost-effective way of carrying it out?
l What is the optimal cost?
The approach is particularly useful for the output-driven approach to budgeting
because it forces questions to be asked about the programmes planned and the cost–
beneﬁt aspects of the plans. On the negative side, it is a time-consuming activity and
is perhaps most usefully applied on a selective basis where the questioning approach
is most useful. Some activities of an organisation carry an element of discretion and 
it is worthwhile reappraising them on occasions. Others form an essential core, so 
that it might be less appropriate to take a zero-based approach.
Write down your personal budget for (a) the week ahead, and (b) the month ahead. 
Show money coming in and money going out. How difficult is it to prepare a budget?
What problems did you encounter? To what extent is uncertainty about the future a
problem? In the example which follows there is no uncertainty – it assumes the future
may be forecast precisely. Work through the example and then consider how much 
such an exercise would be affected by uncertainty in the real world.
21.7 Practical example – development of a budget
This practical example is based on the operational budgeting in the company called
DressSense Partnership. There are two working partners who have built up, over ten
years, a small but successful business which makes a range of ladies’ dresses sold
through boutiques and selected regional department stores. The image of an exclusive
label is maintained by not selling through national department stores. The example
sets out the mission statement and objectives of the company. It then sets out the 
budget details for Year 5, as agreed by line managers after negotiations in the later
months of Year 4, together with the balance sheet expected at 31 December Year 4 as
a starting point to the budget preparation for Year 5.
To help the reader follow the trail through the practical example, each table of infor-
mation has a reference of the type (T 1) at the top left-hand corner. This reference is
used in later tables to give a cross-reference to the source of data used in calculation.
It is always good practice, in working practical examples, to give plenty of cross-
referencing and to show full workings so that the reader can follow the sequence.

Mission statement and objectives
BestGear Partnership
Mission statement
The company intends to maintain its position in a niche market in supplying fashionable
designer dresses at affordable prices for the discerning buyer. The relatively small scale
of the operation will be maintained as part of the attraction of the product.
The two working partners, who together own the business, are committed to main-
taining a close relationship with customers and staff so that quality of service remains
uppermost at all times.
Objectives
l The company intends to recruit high-quality staff.
l The company will continue its no-quibble money-back-within-30-days policy.
l The company has a target gross profit of at least 35% on total sales.

Preparation of individual budgets
From the information presented in Tables T 1 to T 5 the various detailed budgets are
prepared as shown in Tables T 6 to T 18. These lead to the master budget set out in
Tables T 19 to T 21.
Sales budget: sales and debtors
The sales budget sets out the volume of sales expected for each product, multiplied by
the expected selling price, to obtain  the total sales by value expected for each product. The
total sales for the year ahead may then be calculated, shown in bold print in the 
sales budget.

Production plan
The production plan starts with the volume of output, calculated by taking the
planned sales volume and adjusting this for planned levels of opening and closing
stock of ﬁnished goods. If it is planned to have a level of closing stock, then this will
require additional production. To the extent that there exists stock at the start of the
period, that will reduce the need for current production. From T 3 it may be noted that
the business plans to have no amounts of opening or closing stock because all units are
made to speciﬁc order. That is a simpliﬁcation introduced to keep the length of this
exercise reasonable, but it is somewhat unusual because most businesses will hold
stock of ﬁnished goods ready for unexpected demand. As a reminder that stock plans
should be taken into account, the production plans in T 8 are shown with lines for
opening and closing stock of ﬁnished goods.

Direct materials budget: purchases, stock and trade creditors
Once the production plan has been decided, the costs of the various inputs to produc-
tion may be calculated. Direct materials must be purchased to satisfy the production
plans, but the purchases budget must also take into account the need to hold stock of
raw materials. After the purchases budget has been quantiﬁed in terms of cost, the
impact on trade creditors may also be established.
The purchases budget (calculated in T 9) is based on the units of raw material
required for production in the period, making allowance for the opening and closing
stock of raw materials. The plan is to hold sufﬁcient stock at the end of the period to
meet 80% of the following month’s production (see T 3). The number of units to be
purchased will equal the number of units expected to be used in the period, plus the
planned stock of raw materials at the end of the period minus the planned stock of raw
materials at the start of the period (calculated in T 9).

It is also useful to check on the total resource requirement which corresponds to this
total labour cost, since it takes time to plan increases or decreases in labour resources.

The average direct labour cost was given in T 1 as £16,000 per person per year. The 
following calculation assumes that the employees can work equally efﬁciently on any
of the three product lines.
(T 14)
Resource requirement:
Based on an average cost of £16,000 per person per year, the total labour cost of
£253,500 would require 15.8 employees. All are part-time workers.
Production overhead budget
Production overheads include all those overhead items which relate to the production
activity. In this example it includes heat and light, business rates and depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated at a rate of 15% on the total cost of equipment held during

Administration expense budget
The administration expense budget includes the partners’ salaries because they are
working partners and their labour cost represents a management cost of the oper-
ations. The fact that the managerial role is carried out by the partners, who are also the
owners of the business, is not relevant to the purposes of management accounting.
What is important is to record a realistic cost of managing the business. Other admin-
istration costs in this example are rent of premises and the salaries of ofﬁce staff (as
shown in T 2).

Budgeted cash flow statement
Where expenses are paid for as soon as they are incurred, the cash outﬂow equals the
expense as shown in the budgeted proﬁt and loss account. In the case of cash collected
from customers, debtors at the start and end of the period must be taken into the 
calculation. In the case of cash paid to suppliers the creditors at the start and end of
the period must be taken into account. The cash ﬂow statement contains references to
working notes which follow the statement and set out the necessary detail.

Interpretation of the practical example
Fiona McTaggart has reviewed the budget illustrated here and now offers some 
comments.
FIONA: This illustration shows how much detail has to go into even the simplest of bud-
geting exercises. Comparing the budget with the statement of objectives, I was a little 
surprised to find no provision in the budgeted profit and loss account in relation to the
money-back promise. If I were involved in this exercise I would include a provision based
on past experience of the level of returns. That wouldn’t affect the cash flow of course
because provisions are accounting allocations with no cash flow implications.
The target gross profit percentage will be achieved overall (gross profit shown in the
master budget is 41.8% of total sales) but is heavily dependent on the high margin on
evening wear. I hope there is plenty of market research to back up those sales projections.
The overall net profit budgeted is 4.2% of total sales, which means there is little scope for
error before the budgeted profit turns to a budgeted loss.
The budgeted cash flow statement shows an overall surplus on operations of the year,
turning to a cash deficit when the effect of buying the new equipment is brought into the
calculation, but that does not tell the whole story. The £80,000 cash outlay for the new
equipment is needed at the start of the year whereas the cash inflows will be spread over
the year, so the company will need to borrow early in the year to pay for the equipment.
There will have to be a monthly statement of cash flows to show the bank how the cash
will flow out and in over the year as a whole. The borrowing could perhaps be short-term

Chapter 21 Preparing a budget
601
borrowing in view of the overall surplus, but there are other potential cash flows which are
not dealt with here. The partners are working partners and are taking salaries in cash but
they may also need to draw out more cash to pay their tax bills.
It is interesting to compare these management accounts with the way in which external
reporting for financial purposes might appear. The textbooks always suggest that partners’
salaries are an appropriation of profit for financial reporting purposes and should appear as
such in the partners’ capital accounts with a matching entry for drawings.
That’s all far too elaborate for management accounting purposes. What matters here is
that these are working partners and if they did not do the work, someone else would have
to. Provided the salary is a reasonable representation of a reward for the work done, it is
far more sensible to show the expense in the profit and loss account.
21.8 Shorter budget periods
The illustration in section 21.7 is based on a 12-month period for relative ease of illus-
tration. Management accounting information is demanded more frequently than this
in reality. The following example of Newtrend shows the budget preparation on a
quarterly basis. Most businesses budget monthly, with some producing ﬁgures more
frequently than that.
21.8.1
Worked example: data
Newtrend Ltd is a new business which has been formed to buy standard radio units
and modify them to the speciﬁc needs of customers.
The business will acquire ﬁxed assets costing £200,000 and a stock of 1,000 standard
radio units on the ﬁrst day of business. The ﬁxed assets are expected to have a ﬁve-
year life with no residual value at the end of that time.
Sales are forecast as follows:
Year 1
Year 2
Quarter 1
Quarter 2
Quarter 3
Quarter 4
Quarter 1
Modified radio units
8,100
8,400
8,700
7,800
8,100
The selling price of each unit will be £90.
The cost of production of each unit is speciﬁed as follows:
£
Cost of standard unit purchased
30
Direct labour
33
Fixed overhead
12
75
The ﬁxed overhead per unit includes an allocation of depreciation. The annual
depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis and is allocated on the basis of a cost
per unit to be produced during the year.
Suppliers of standard radio units will allow one month’s credit. Customers are
expected to take two months’ credit.
Wages will be paid as they are incurred in production. Fixed overhead costs will be
paid as they are incurred.
The stock of ﬁnished goods at the end of each quarter will be sufﬁcient to satisfy
20% of the planned sales of the following quarter. The stock of standard radio units
will be held constant at 1,000 units.

There are three months in each quarter so some care is required in working out what
amounts are paid to suppliers in each quarter. The schedule of payments to suppliers
shows, in quarter 1, the payment for initial stock of 1,000 units (which occurs at 
the beginning of month 2). It also shows in quarter 1 the payment for purchases that
took place in the ﬁrst two months of that quarter. The purchases of the ﬁnal month of
quarter 1 are paid for in quarter 2, along with the purchases of the ﬁrst two months of
that quarter. Stock remains constant at 1,000 units and so the pattern of payments con-
tinues to the end of the year where there is a trade creditor for the one month’s unpaid
purchases of quarter 4. Figure 21.3 shows the pattern of purchases and payment.

Comment on cash budget
A cash budget is the type of statement which would be required by someone being
asked to lend money to the business. The start-up situation requires cash but there 
is a positive cash ﬂow from operations. The lender would want to add to the cash 
budget a schedule of loan repayments and interest payments to see whether the 
operational cash ﬂows could meet the ﬁnancing needs of the business.
21.9 Summary
In this chapter you met the deﬁnition of a budget as a detailed plan that sets out, in
money terms, the plans for income and expenditure in respect of a future period of
time. It is prepared in advance of that time period and is based on the agreed objectives
for that period of time, together with the strategy planned to achieve those objectives.
The short-term budgetary process plays its part in long-range planning. The admin-
istration of the budgeting process has been described and the beneﬁts of budgeting
have been put forward in terms of planning and control. The chapter has developed
in detail a practical example of the preparation of a master budget.
Key themes in this chapter are:
l A budgetary system serves the needs of management in making judgements and
decisions, exercising planning and control and achieving effective communication
and motivation.
l Long-range planning begins with a vision statement setting out a vision for the
future direction of the organisation. From this vision the long-range objectives are
set covering a period of perhaps three to ﬁve years.
l A strategy describes the courses of action to be taken in achieving the long-range
objectives. The different functions of the organisation will work together in develop-
ing the strategy.
l Budgetary planning and control provides a method of quantifying the strategy of
the business.
l A budget is a detailed plan which sets out, in money terms, the plans for income
and expenditure in respect of a future period of time. It is prepared in advance of
that time period and is based on the agreed objectives for that period of time,
together with the strategy planned to achieve those objectives.
l Administration of a budget requires a budget committee which will design the
strategy, co-ordinate the inputs and communicate the objectives and strategy.
l Budget preparation usually starts with the sales budget because sales are the critical
factor. From this the operational budgets are formed, leading to a ﬁnance plan and
then the master budget, which consists of a budgeted proﬁt and loss account, a
budgeted balance sheet and a budgeted cash ﬂow statement.
l Budgets may be participative through a bottom-up process, or imposed through a
top-down process. A negotiated budget is based on a mixture of both approaches.
l Co-ordination and review by the budget committee may lead to a further round of
negotiation in order to arrive at the best position for the entity as a whole, before
ﬁnal acceptance by the budget committee.
l The beneﬁts of budgeting are seen in planning, control, communication and co-
ordination. They also provide a basis for performance evaluation.
l The behavioural aspects have been outlined here as an introduction to a major area
of study which will be encountered in subsequent study of the subject.
l The detailed case study in the chapter shows the sequence of preparation of all 
budgets leading to the master budget.

The fixed overhead per unit includes an allocation of depreciation. The annual depreciation is
calculated on a straight-line basis and is allocated on the basis of a cost per unit to be produced
during the year.
Suppliers of standard tool units will allow one month’s credit. Customers are expected to
take two months’ credit.
Wages will be paid as they are incurred in production. Fixed overhead costs will be paid as
they are incurred.
The stock of finished goods at the end of each quarter will be sufficient to satisfy 10% of the
planned sales of the following quarter. The stock of standard tool units will be held constant at
500 units.
It may be assumed that the year is divided into quarters of equal length and that sales, 
production and purchases are spread evenly throughout any quarter.

The budget for the second six months was revised to take account of the following predictions:
(a) Revenue during the second six months would continue at the level achieved during the first
six months.
(b) Cost control measures would be implemented to restore the gross profit percentage to the
budgeted level.
(c) Advertising, selling and general administration costs would be maintained at the levels
achieved in the first six months.
(d) Trading stocks would be reduced to the level originally budgeted at 30 September.
(e) Trade debtors would be reduced to the equivalent of one month’s sales.
(f) Trade creditors would be maintained at the equivalent of one month’s cost of goods sold.
(g) Interest on the medium-term loan would remain at 16% per annum.

Activities for study groups
Case 21.1
Today’s task is to review the first stage of budget preparation in a major hospital dealing with
a wide range of medical conditions, including accident and emergency services. (There are 
indications within the case study of how to allocate the time on the presumption that one hour
is available in total, but the times may be adjusted proportionately for a different overall length.)
Before the activity starts obtain and look through the annual report and accounts of a hos-
pital trust and a regional health authority, looking for discussion of the budgetary process and
the way in which budgets are presented in the annual report.
Half of the group should form the budget committee, deciding among themselves the role of
each individual within the hospital but having regard to the need to keep a balance between
medical services, medical support staff and administration. The other half of the group should
take the role of specialty team leaders presenting their budgets (‘specialty’ being the term used
to describe one particular specialist aspect of hospital treatment, e.g. children’s specialisms
[paediatrics], women’s conditions [obstetrics and gynaecology], or dealing with older persons
[geriatrics]).
Initially the group should work together for 20 minutes to write a mission statement and set 
of corporate objectives. The budget committee should then hold a separate meeting lasting 
10 minutes to decide: (a) what questions they will ask of the specialty team leaders when they
present their budget plans, and (b) where the sources of conflict are most likely to be found. In
the meantime each specialty team leader should set out a brief statement of objectives for that
specialty team and a note of the main line items which would appear in the budget, indicating
where conflict with other teams within the hospital is most likely to arise as a result of the 
budgeting process.
The budget committee should then interview each specialty manager (5 minutes each), with 
the other specialty managers attending as observers. After all interviews have been held, the
budget committee should prepare a brief report dealing with the effectiveness and limitations
of the budgetary process as experienced in the exercise. The specialty managers should work
together to produce a report on their perceptions of the effectiveness and limitations of the 
budgetary process (15 minutes).
Case 21.2
As a group you are planning to launch a monthly student newsletter on the university’s website.
The roles to be allocated are: editor, reporters, webmaster, university accountant, student asso-
ciation representatives. Work together as a team to prepare a list of budget headings for the
year ahead and suggest how you would gain access to realistic figures for inclusion in the 
budget. Include in your budget plan a note of the key risks and uncertainties.

English Woodland Grant Scheme
Operations Note 9 19th August 2011
Standard Costs
Development
Forestry Commission (FC) England uses
Standard Costs in the English Woodland 
Grant Scheme (EWGS) to satisfy EU Rural
Development Plan requirements. The costs
have been developed and validated using a
working group comprising representatives of
the forestry industry. This includes contractors,
advisors and Forestry Commission staff. 
The aim is to review and update existing
Standard Costs and validate any proposed new Standard Costs at approximately annually.
FC England set up the working group to agree Standard Costs, who meet at least once a year. 
The group discusses the Standard Costs based on comments raised by FC staff and grant scheme
stakeholders, plus their own experience of current operational costs. The group then recommends
whether new Standard Costs should be introduced or existing Standard Costs revised. The FC 
comes to a final decision on the range of Standard Costs for EWGS based on the working group
recommendations.
On occasions, specific, new Standard Costs will be required to support the delivery of highly targeted
funds such as Challenge fund initiatives. Where there is no experience of this work within the
reference group, FC England will seek to use other references to set those standard costs.
Principles
Some guiding principles were agreed with the working group from the outset of EWGS:
(a) ‘Typical’ costs – It is not possible to draw up a list to meet every conceivable local situation.
Therefore Standard Costs reflect an average figure for the country, with the acceptance that there
will be some ‘winners and losers’ across the country. The costs should reflect a typical situation
Standard costs

for the majority of circumstances (~ 75% or more). Where costs had a wide range due to clear
variables e.g. clearing small vs. big Rhododendron, then a separate cost is agreed.
(b) Outcome focus – Funding through EWGS is to provide desired outcomes. Operations and any
associated standard costs will be supported on this basis and in line with good practice to
achieve those outcomes. For example, support for forest roads is on the basis of what kind
vehicles will use it.
(c) Specification – Set against the outcome focus, for the purposes of good contract
management/control we have to set out clearly what we are buying for each cost.
(d) Fit for purpose – The specifications meet good practice guidelines and are designed to meet the
desired outcome.
(e) Best Value – The standard costs are realistic costs based on the above principles. If an applicant
wishes to deliver a specification in excess of the good practice guidelines, the FC will still only pay
on the basis of a ‘fit for purpose’ specification.
(f) Supervision – Supervision/management costs can be applied where significant additional time or
skill is required to ensure the operation is completed correctly. This will be applied using Agent hourly
rates (operation code L2), normally up to a maximum of 10% of the operational cost. Occasionally
we may accept up to 20% supervision for highly sensitive operations e.g. for a potentially
damaging operation on a sensitive site such as a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) woodland.

Chapter 22 Standard costs
615
22.1 Introduction
Chapter 21 explained the budgetary process and illustrated in detail a method of
preparing budgets for planning purposes. The use of budgets for control purposes
was explained in that chapter in terms of comparing the actual outcome with the
expected results as shown by the budget.
When actual costs are compared with budgeted costs, the comparison is of the total
cost for the line item under consideration (e.g. cost of various types of materials, cost
of various categories of labour or cost of a range of categories of overheads). Where
there is a signiﬁcant difference between the budget and the actual outcome, that dif-
ference may be investigated. (It has to be remembered, however, that the investigation
will itself have a cost and that cost may be minimised by ﬁrst trying to narrow down
the causes of the difference.)
To analyse the difference between what was expected and what actually happened,
it is useful to make comparisons in terms of cost per unit rather than total cost of a 
line item in the budget. Such costs per unit may be estimated in advance and used 
as a standard against which to compare the actual costs incurred. The cost per unit,
measured in advance of the operations to be undertaken, is called a standard cost.
Definition
Standard cost is the planned unit cost of the products, components or services
produced in a period.1
Once the standard cost has been decided, the actual cost may be compared with the
standard. If it equals the standard then the actual outcome has matched expectations.
If the actual cost is greater than, or less than, the standard cost allowed, then there will
be a variance to be investigated. This chapter explains how the standard costs may be
determined and how the variances may be quantiﬁed.
Definition
A variance is the difference between a planned, budgeted or standard cost and the
actual cost incurred.2
22.2 Purpose of using standard costs
It has already been shown (in Chapter 17) that calculation of the cost of an item of
input or output may be analysed in terms of two measurements:
1 a physical quantity measurement multiplied by
2 a price measurement.
Actual costs are measured after the event by reference to the quantity of the
resource used and its price. When the actual cost is measured there is no doubt as to
the quantity and price.
Standard costs are measured in advance of the period of time to which they relate,
so that estimation is necessary. This requires estimation of physical inputs and outputs,
and monetary estimates of prices of inputs and outputs. In order to determine useful
standards it is necessary ﬁrst of all to consider the purpose for which the standards
will be used. The purpose could cover any or all of the following:
1 to provide product costs for stock valuation;
2 to increase control within a budgeting system;
3 to gauge performance of a business unit by use of variance analysis;

Part 8 Planning and control
616
Activity 22.1
4 to integrate costs in the planning and pricing structure of a business;
5 to reduce record-keeping costs when transactions take place at different prices.
This chapter will concentrate on items 2, 3 and 4 of the foregoing list, showing how
variance analysis may be used for purposes of control, performance evaluation and plan-
ning. First, the standard cost is explained. The control process is then outlined by means
of a ﬂow diagram. Most of the chapter deals with the calculation and interpretation of
variances in the cost of direct materials, direct labour and production overhead. That
provides information to management for use in making judgements and carrying out
performance evaluations. The ﬁnal section discusses the usefulness of variance analy-
sis based on standard costing in planning the efﬁcient operation of the business.
22.3 The level of output to be used in setting standards
Calculation of the standard cost requires a view to be taken on the most appropriate
physical measurement to incorporate in the cost calculation. Three approaches are
instanced here. The ﬁrst uses a basic level of output, the second looks to an ideal level
of output and the third uses a currently attainable level of output.
The basic standard is one which never changes and consequently remains a 
permanent basis for comparison. This gives a base line against which to make long-
term comparisons. It has the disadvantage of becoming increasingly unrealistic as 
circumstances change.
The ideal standard is one which applies in dream conditions where nothing ever goes
wrong. It represents the cost incurred under the most efﬁcient operating conditions. It
is an almost unattainable target towards which an organisation may constantly aim,
but it may also cause a lowering of morale in the organisation if staff can never reach
the target.
Currently attainable standards lie between these two extremes, deﬁned as stan-
dards which should normally equal expectations under ‘normally efﬁcient operating
conditions’. They may represent quite stiff targets to reach, but they are not beyond
possibility. Currently attainable standards are the most frequently used because 
they give a fair base for comparisons, they set a standard which ought to be achieved
and they give staff a sense of achievement when the attainable target is reached. Thus
they contribute to all the management functions of planning and control which were
explained in Chapter 16.
Setting standards also relates to performance. A standard may be set by estimating
in advance the expected performance of a work unit. This sometimes is called an 
ex ante standard (where ex ante means ‘before the event takes place’). Alternatively a
standard may be set by observing performance and estimating what is realistically
attainable. Because this method learns from the past performance it is sometimes
called an ex post standard (where ex post means ‘after the event has taken place’).
Although the standard cost may be quantiﬁed as a single ﬁgure, it may in practice
represent a whole range of possible ﬁgures because it is an estimate from a range of
possible outcomes. This chapter will apply a single-ﬁgure standard in illustrative case
studies, without questioning further the basis on which the standard was created.
These first three sections of the chapter have explained the meaning of a standard and
the various different approaches to the creation of a standard. Read the sections again
and satisfy yourself that you are aware of the differences. That awareness will help you 
in thinking about the interpretation of variances.
We now turn to an explanation of how standards are used in the control process.

Chapter 22 Standard costs
617
22.4 The control process
Figure 22.1 shows the process of calculating and using standard costs for control 
purposes. The calculation of standards involves asking technical specialists, who are
probably not management accountants, to specify the standard inputs of resources. The
management accountant takes this information and prepares a standard cost speciﬁ-
cation, usually converting that to a cost per unit of input or output. Actual costs are then
measured and compared with the standard. Variances which emerge are quantiﬁed,
analysed and reported. This may lead to control actions in relation to eliminating vari-
ances. It may also lead to revision of the standard costs if they are no longer relevant.
Figure 22.1
Use of standards in the control process
The presence of a standard cost provides a benchmark against which to evaluate the
actual cost. The technical term for this process is variance analysis. Cost variances
may be described as adverse or favourable, depending on how the standard and the
actual costs compare. If the actual cost is greater than the standard expected, then the
variance is said to be ‘adverse’. If the actual cost is less than the standard expected,
then the variance is said to be ‘favourable’. The existence of either type of variance
could lead to investigation of the cause. The component costs must be investigated
separately so that they may be separately analysed and interpreted. We now move on
to give more detail on the process of calculating and analysing variances for direct
materials cost and direct labour cost.

Part 8 Planning and control
618
Activity 22.2
Definitions
An adverse variance arises when the actual cost is greater than the standard cost.
A favourable variance arises when the actual cost is less than the standard cost.
Suggest three situations in which a business organisation might decide to revise
standards, as indicated in Figure 22.1, following calculation and analysis of variances. 
Is revision equally likely for adverse and for favourable variances? Make sure that you
know the definitions of adverse and favourable variances. They will appear frequently 
in the following sections.
22.5 Direct materials cost variance
Take as a starting point one of the ingredients of prime cost: direct materials. If the
actual cost differs from the standard cost, then the cause may lie in the materials
usage, or in the price of the materials, or in a mixture of both. An adverse cost vari-
ance could indicate that the price paid was higher than expected when the standard
was set, or it could indicate that the amount of materials used was greater than that
expected.

At this point in learning about variance analysis, some students will ask: ‘Why are
the formulae in this form? I can see other combinations of symbols which could break
the cost variance down into two components.’ The answer is that there are other 
combinations but one of the aims of management accounting is to present relevant
information. In the form given in the exhibit, these variances produce relevant 
information.
To understand the relevance of the variances, it may help to think of the standard
cost as a rectangle whose area is measured by multiplying the standard price of 
materials by the standard quantity of materials used (Figure 22.2).
Figure 22.2
Representing standard cost as a rectangular area
Now imagine that the actual cost is greater than standard cost so that a rectangle
representing actual cost will ﬁt around the outside of the standard cost rectangle.
Figure 22.3 shows the two rectangles together. The total cost variance is represented
by the shaded area in the shape of an ‘inverted L’ to the top and right-hand side of the
diagram. The top part of the blue shaded area represents variance caused by actual
price being greater than standard price. The right-hand side represents variance
caused by the actual quantity used being greater than the standard quantity allowed.
In terms of management responsibility, the price variance will be in the hands of the
purchasing department, while the usage variance will be in the hands of the produc-
tion department. But who should be held accountable for the top right-hand corner where
a question mark appears? This is a mixture of price variation and usage variation. 
The production manager will disclaim any responsibility for the price aspect and the
buying department will say it has no control over quantity.
Figure 22.3
Representing actual cost and standard cost as two areas superimposed
Management accounting is full of hard decisions and as far as possible tries to be
fair. For the top right-hand corner of the diagram, that is almost impossible; how-
ever, there is a view that usage is within the organisation’s control to a greater extent
than the price of inputs taken from an external supplier. Management accounting
therefore takes the view that the production manager’s responsibility for usage should
be limited in order to leave out the area containing the question mark. By default,
therefore, that area at the top right-hand corner is allowed to fall entirely into the price
variance.

Activity 22.3
Read this section again to ensure that you understand fully the method of calculating
direct materials cost variance. Compare the formulae in Table 22.2 and the diagram in
Figure 22.3. If there is any step which you do not understand, seek help at this stage from
your tutor or a fellow student.
22.6 Direct labour cost variance
The starting point in analysis of direct labour cost variances resembles closely that
used for direct materials, except that the price variance changes its name to labour rate
variance and the usage variance changes to labour efﬁciency variance.
Direct labour cost variance
equals
Direct labour 
Direct labour 
rate variance

The formulae for calculating direct labour variances are similar to those used for
direct materials. They are shown in Table 22.2.

Standard cost of labour (SC) minus actual cost

multiplied by standard hours allowed (SH)

Actual cost (AC) = actual labour rate (AR)
multiplied by actual hours worked (AH)
Actual hours worked (AH), multiplied by the
difference between the standard labour rate (SR)

(SH) and the actual hours worked (AH)
Formula

SC = (SR × SH)
minus

SR (SH −AH)
At this point you meet a new idea, that of the standard hour. A standard hour is
deﬁned as the amount of work achievable, at standard efﬁciency levels, in one hour.3
Suppose that a study has been carried out of work patterns at standard efﬁciency. It
has been estimated that one employee can assemble 10 computer boxes in one hour.
That deﬁnes the standard hour for that particular work. If 100 computer boxes are 
produced then the standard hours allowed are 10 hours. If the employee takes 11 hours
to produce the 100 boxes, that is more than the standard allowed. Investigation will be

required to ﬁnd the cause. It could be the case that the employee worked too slowly.
On the other hand, it could be the case that the employee worked at normal efﬁciency
but the components supplied were not of the usual speciﬁcation and there were
difﬁculties with the assembly process.
Definition
A standard hour is defined as the amount of work achievable, at standard efficiency
levels, in one hour.4
If you try to draw a diagram for direct labour variances, superimposing the actual
cost on the standard cost as shown for direct materials in Figure 22.3, you will ﬁnd that
the area labelled with a question mark in Figure 22.3 has all been allocated to the rate
variance. It is argued in management accounting that the organisation is more likely
to have control over efﬁciency than it has over labour rate, which may well be deter-
mined by the labour market in general. The efﬁciency variance should therefore not
include any element of variation in labour rate, and the top right-hand corner of the
diagram is all taken into the rate variance.
Read this section again to make sure that you understand fully the formulae in Table 22.2.
Try to produce a diagram for direct labour similar to that drawn in Figure 22.3 for direct
materials. Note down the similarities and the differences between the formulae for direct
materials variances and the formulae for direct labour variances.
22.7 Variable overhead cost variance
It was explained in Chapter 17 that the most effective method of calculating an over-
head cost rate is to calculate the overhead cost per direct labour hour. This is because
labour working usually causes most of the overhead costs to be incurred (unless the
business is highly machine-intensive). It will be assumed throughout this chapter that
a standard cost of variable overheads can be expressed as a cost per direct labour hour.
As well as being the preferred choice from Chapter 17, it also makes the calculation 
of variable overhead variances look very similar to the calculation of direct labour
variances.

The variances are expressed in words and formulae in Table 22.3.
Read this section again and make sure that you understand fully the formulae for
calculating variable overhead cost variances. Compare these formulae with those used 
for direct labour cost variances. What are the points of similarity? What are the points of
difference? Can you see consistent patterns in the variances for direct materials costs,
direct labour costs and variable overhead costs?

22.8 Fixed overhead expenditure variance
Although a ﬁxed overhead cost per unit may be calculated for purposes of valuing
stock, it leads to all manner of problems because, by deﬁnition, ﬁxed overhead costs
do not vary with volume. For the purposes of control, it is more important to know
whether the total amount of actual expenditure equals or exceeds the budgeted
amount. Thus no attempt will be made here to deal with ﬁxed overhead cost variances
on the basis of a standard cost per unit. The variance which is most important is the
ﬁxed overhead expenditure variance, found by subtracting the actual ﬁxed overhead
incurred from the amount of ﬁxed overhead budgeted (see Exhibit 22.1). If the actual
ﬁxed overhead is greater than the budget, there is an adverse variance. If the actual
ﬁxed overhead is less than the budget, there is a favourable variance.

22.9 Case study: Allerdale Ltd
The chapter now moves into a case study as a means of providing an illustration of 
the calculation and interpretation of variances. Allerdale Ltd uses a manufacturing

Chapter 22 Standard costs
623
process which involves fastening laminated surfaces on to workbenches. The material
for the laminated plastic surface is purchased in large sheets and cut to size at the start
of the process. The sheets of laminated plastic represent the direct materials cost of 
the process. Employees work on cutting and fastening the laminated surfaces and
trimming them to ﬁt. This work is classed as direct labour cost. Overhead costs are
incurred in using indirect materials such as glues and staples, indirect labour such as
cleaners for the production area, and the costs of heating, lighting and maintaining the
factory premises. The overheads are partly variable (such as the indirect materials and
power) and partly ﬁxed (such as insurance, rent and business rates).
The variances in respect of direct materials, direct labour, variable overhead and ﬁxed
overhead are now explained in turn, using data provided by the accounting records.
22.9.1
Direct materials variances
Data for direct materials
The standard amount of laminated material allowed is two square metres per
workbench. The standard price of the material is £0.90 per square metre. During the
month of June, 200 workbenches were laminated. The amount of material used was
430 square metres and the price paid was £0.95 per square metre.
Calculations of direct materials variances are shown in Exhibits 22.2 and 22.3, using
the formulae set out in Table 22.1.
Exhibit 22.2
Calculation of direct materials total variance
The standard allowance is 2 square metres each for 200 workbenches, which is 
400 square metres standard quantity (SQ) in total. Standard price per unit (SP) is
£0.90 per square metre. Actual quantity used (AQ) is 430 square metres and actual
price per unit (AP) is £0.95 per square metre.
Total cost variance = standard cost minus actual cost (SC −AC)
= (SP × SQ) minus (AP × AQ)
= (£0.90 × 400 sq metres) minus (£0.95 × 430 sq metres)
= £360 minus £408.50
= £48.50 adverse variance
In Exhibit 22.2, the variance is adverse because the actual cost is greater than 
the standard cost set for the direct materials to be used. The total variance may be 
subdivided into direct materials price and usage variances, using the formulae from
Table 22.1 to give the analysis shown in Exhibit 22.3. The data for this calculation have
already been set out in words and in symbols at the start of Exhibit 22.2. The same
symbols and ﬁgures are used in Exhibit 22.3.
Exhibit 22.3
Calculation of direct materials price and usage variances
Price variance
Usage variance
= AQ (SP −AP)
= SP (SQ −AQ)
= 430 sq metres (£0.90 −£0.95)
= £0.90 (400 −430)
= £21.50 adverse variance
= £27.00 adverse variance
You will see that the actual price per unit of materials is 95 pence, which is greater
than the 90 pence per unit set as a standard cost. The price variance of £21.50 is there-
fore adverse. The actual amount of direct materials used is 430 square metres, which

Part 8 Planning and control
624
is greater than the 400 square metres set as a standard. The usage variance is therefore
also adverse. The two variances, added together, equal the total adverse variance of
£48.50 calculated in Exhibit 22.2. We now know that the overall variance is caused by
both price and usage effects but that the usage problem is the greater of the two.
22.9.2
Adverse or favourable variances?
If you have followed these calculations yourself you will have obtained negative signs in
each calculation. The negative sign corresponds to an adverse variance because in each
case the actual outcome is worse than the predetermined standard. However, it is risky
to rely on plus and minus signs, because it is easy to make careless errors in calculations
and to turn the formula round accidentally. It is always safer to look at each calculation
on a common-sense basis. The total cost variance will be adverse where the actual out-
come is worse than the standard cost allowed. The price variance will be adverse where
the actual unit price is greater than the standard price allowed. The usage variance will
be adverse where the actual quantity used is greater than the standard quantity allowed.
22.9.3
What caused the variance?
It is often impossible to be deﬁnite about the cause of a particular variance, but sug-
gestions may be made as a basis for further investigation. A variance in the price
of materials indicates that the actual price paid per unit differs from that expected
when the standard was set. That could be because the price has changed, in which case
the standard should be revised. The variance could be due to purchasing a more
expensive quality of material, in which case there will need to be an investigation as
to whether this was due to the production department requesting a higher quality
than that permitted when the standard was set, or whether it was a procedural error
in the buying department. Perhaps the higher quality was found to be necessary
because the previous quality of materials was causing too much labour time to be
wasted on substandard products. Variances may interact, which means it is important
to look at the cost control picture as a whole.
A variance in the usage of materials may be an indication that lack of quality in the
materials is causing too much wastage. It may be that employees have not received
sufﬁcient training in the best way of using the material. Perhaps a new machine has
been installed which operates much faster to meet expanding demand levels but has
a naturally higher wastage rate.
Once the calculation of two variances has been mastered, the mathematically
minded student soon realises that the subdivisions could be taken further. The usage
variance may be split into a yield variance, comparing what goes in with what comes
out of the process, and a mix variance, looking at the effect of having a different mix
of input materials than was planned when the standard was set. That level of detailed
analysis will not be taken further here, but you should be aware that there is a world
of detail, to explore at another time, in relation to variance analysis.
Some of the foregoing causes of variance may lead to remedial action. Others may
lead to a decision that it is in the interests of the organisation to accept the difference
and revise the standard accordingly. Fiona McTaggart gives her views.
FIONA: I see my job as reporting the variances accurately and in good time. The decisions
on how to use those variances are for those who manage the operations of the business.
If they tell me that a variance has become an accepted part of the operation, I will discuss
with them whether the new data should be incorporated in a revised standard, or whether
there is a continuing control aspect of identifying that variance to ensure that it stays within
acceptable limits.
The case study now continues to illustrate the calculation of direct labour cost 
variances.

22.9.4
Direct labour variances
Data for direct labour
Allerdale Ltd has set a standard labour rate of £4 per direct labour hour. Actual hours
worked in June were 9,820 at an actual cost of £37,316. The standard allowance of
direct labour hours, for the output achieved, was 10,000 hours.
Calculations of variances are shown in Exhibits 22.4 and 22.5, using the formulae
set out in Table 22.2. In Exhibit 22.4, the variance is favourable because the actual cost
is less than the standard cost set for the direct labour to be used. The total variance may
be subdivided into direct labour rate and efﬁciency variances, using the formulae from
Table 22.2, to give the analysis shown in Exhibit 22.5. The symbols and the relevant
ﬁgures needed for these variances are set out at the start of Exhibit 22.4.
The actual rate of pay per hour is less than the standard rate and the rate variance is
therefore favourable. The actual hours worked are less than the standard hours allowed
which means that the efﬁciency variance is also favourable. The total favourable variance
of £2,684 has, therefore, two components of which the rate variance of £1,964 is the
more important.
Exhibit 22.4
Calculation of direct labour total variance
The standard allowance of direct labour time is 10,000 standard hours (SH). The
standard labour rate set (SR) is £4 per hour. Actual hours worked (AH) are stated to
be 9,820. The actual labour rate (AR) is not stated but can be calculated by dividing
the actual cost (AC) of £37,316 by the actual hours of 9,820, to give £3.80 per hour.
Total cost variance = standard cost minus actual cost (SC −AC)
= (SR × SH) minus (AR × AH)
= (£4 × 10,000) minus (£3.80 × 9,820)
= £40,000 minus £37,316
= £2,684 favourable variance

= £720 favourable variance
22.9.5
What caused the variance?
With direct labour, as with direct materials, it is easier to apply conjecture than to ﬁnd
sure and certain explanations. A favourable variance in the labour rate is an indication
that the actual wage rate per employee was lower than that which was expected when
the standard was set. That could be due to an anticipated pay increase having failed
to materialise. Alternatively, it could suggest that the mix of employees is different
from that intended when the standard was set, so that the average wage paid is lower
than planned. A variance in labour efﬁciency means that fewer hours were worked
than were expected when the standard was set. This could be due to a new training
scheme, or less than the expected amount of enforced idle time when machinery is not
operating. Perhaps better-quality material was purchased, giving a higher purchase
price, but this caused less wastage and allowed employees to work more efﬁciently in
producing the ﬁnished goods.

Part 8 Planning and control
626
As with direct materials, there is no particular reason to stop with analysing 
only two variances. A change in the mix of employees could be a cause for variance
within the overall efﬁciency variance. The number of subdivisions depends only on the
ingenuity of those devising the variance analysis. This book will, however, be content
with analysing only two causes of direct labour cost variance.
Fiona McTaggart has discovered that often there are interlocking effects in vari-
ances on direct materials and direct labour. She was recently in discussion with the
plant manager:
FIONA: It is the management accountant’s job to produce the variance report and it is the
plant manager’s job to interpret the result, but naturally I am always interested in the expla-
nation. Last month we had a favourable variance on direct materials price but unexpected
adverse variances on direct materials usage and direct labour efficiency. On investigation,
it was found that the buying department had seen a special offer on metal sheeting which
dramatically cut the unit cost of material, so they bought six months’ supply. What they
didn’t know was that the machinery on the factory floor can’t deal with that particular type
of metal sheeting because it slips intermittently in the rollers. The result was far more
wastage of materials than expected, labour time lost through having to process materials
twice, and some very irate operatives who lost bonuses because so much time was
wasted. The problem was so bad that after one month the remaining unused material was
sold for scrap and the correct specification was purchased. It was a very expensive lesson
in the need for interdepartmental communication.
22.9.6
Variable overhead cost variance
Data for variable overhead
Allerdale Ltd has set a standard variable overhead cost rate of £2 per direct labour
hour. Actual hours worked in June were 9,820 and the actual variable overhead cost
incurred was £22,586. The standard allowance of direct labour hours, for the output
achieved, was 10,000 hours.
Calculations of variances are set out in Exhibits 22.6 and 22.7, using the formulae
set out in Table 22.3. The standard allowance of direct labour time is 10,000 standard
hours (SH). The standard variable overhead cost rate set is £2 per direct labour hour.
The actual variable overhead cost rate (AR) is not stated but can be calculated by
dividing the actual cost (AC) of £22,586 by the actual direct labour hours of 9,820, to
give £2.30 per direct labour hour.
Exhibit 22.6
Calculation of variable overhead cost variance
Total cost variance = standard cost minus actual cost (SC −AC)
= (SR × SH) minus (AR × AH)

= £360 favourable variance

Chapter 22 Standard costs
627
Activity 22.7
The symbols and the relevant ﬁgures needed in order to calculate the variable over-
head rate and efﬁciency variances are set out at the start of Exhibit 22.6. The actual
variable overhead cost rate of £2.30 per direct labour hour is greater than the standard
rate of £2 and there is an adverse variance of £2,946. This is offset to some extent by 
a favourable efﬁciency variance due to the actual hours worked being less than the
standard allowed, but this gives a favourable variance of only £360 so that the com-
bination of the two explains the overall adverse variance of £2,586.
22.9.7
What caused the variance?
The adverse rate variance means that some item of variable overhead has cost more
than expected. There is not sufﬁcient detail available here for an answer to emerge but
in practice the management accountant would now look at the unit cost of each item,
such as glues, staples, paint, cleaning costs and any other variable cost items, to ﬁnd
which had risen above the standard set. The favourable efﬁciency variance is directly due
to labour hours being less than expected when the standard was set. The explanation
will be the same as that given for the favourable efﬁciency variance on direct labour.
22.9.8
Fixed overhead expenditure variance
Data for fixed overhead
Allerdale Ltd budgeted fixed overhead expenditure at £10,000 for the month of June.
The actual amount of fixed overhead expenditure was £11,000.
The most important question to answer here is, ‘Why did we spend more than
expected?’ This is quantiﬁed in the ﬁxed overhead expenditure variance, calculated as
budgeted ﬁxed overhead minus actual ﬁxed overhead. In this example, the result is 
an adverse variance of £1,000. Causes could include an increase in the cost of ﬁxed
overhead or an extra category of ﬁxed overhead, neither of which was expected when
the budget was set.
Copy out the data for the case study, then close the book and test yourself by producing
the calculations and analyses. That exercise will establish your confidence in knowing the
technical material of the chapter.
22.10 Investigating variances
Once the variances have been calculated, those who manage the business have to decide
which variances should be investigated. Should every adverse variance be investigated?
Such an investigation takes time and so itself involves a further cost in searching for a
cause. Is it worth incurring this further cost to ﬁnd out what happened to the costs
under investigation? Such an investigation might unearth some unwelcome facts about
the world beyond accounting. It has been suggested that the accountant feels ‘safe’ in a
separate accountant’s world. Perhaps no one, other than the management accountant,
believes in the system in any event. These radical thoughts have been expressed in
various parts of the academic literature. One extreme conclusion which might be
drawn is that it is safer to avoid any type of investigation.
It is fairly obvious that a reasonable answer lies between the two extremes of 
investigating everything and investigating nothing. Nevertheless, it may be useful to
think about the extreme cases in order to justify the middle ground. Many who take a

Part 8 Planning and control
628
traditional approach prefer to use judgement in deciding which variance to investigate.
Such persons would run their eye down the variance report, item by item, using their
knowledge and experience to identify variances for further investigation. That approach
is called ‘intuition’ and is ﬁne for the experienced manager but risky when applied 
by a trainee manager or someone not familiar with the operational factors behind the
variances. It is also difﬁcult to write a computer program for the intuitive approach. 
If the accounting information is being processed by computer, it is often convenient to
let the computer do the work of highlighting the variances for investigation. So some
systematic approach is needed.
This may be achieved by setting a ﬁlter rule which ﬁlters out the unimportant but
draws attention to the matters regarded as signiﬁcant. This might be, ‘Investigate all
variances which are more than 10% of the total standard cost of this cost centre’. It
might be, ‘Investigate all variances which are more than £10,000 in amount each
month’. Establishing ﬁlters is a matter of experience and judgement in order to ensure
that no signiﬁcant difference by amount is overlooked.
Using ﬁlters may not always be the perfect approach. The choice of what is import-
ant may vary depending on the nature of the variance or the nature of the cost item.
Using the ﬁlter does not take into account the costs and beneﬁts of variance investi-
gation. It does not incorporate the past history of performance in that item, where
inefﬁciencies are persisting through lack of remedial action. The item may be one
where the variance has suddenly worsened dramatically but still falls within the ﬁlter
limits. (For example, where a cost item has habitually shown a variance within 2% of
standard cost but then suddenly increases to 15%, that could be highly signiﬁcant even
though the predetermined ﬁlter is set at 20%.)
The selection of variances for investigation is therefore very much dependent on
circumstances and on the person making the selection. Fiona McTaggart gives her
description of the management accountant’s role in deciding on which variances to
investigate.
FIONA: In my work I keep in close contact with each of the production supervisors. We 
have informal meetings once each month to look at the specifications for the standards.
They give me their views on the type and level of variance which they regard as significant
to their part of the business. From that list I create a set of filters which I apply to the
monthly report on how actual costs measure up against standards. I also add some filters
based on company policy as to what is material to the overall production operations. My
choice of filters has regard to existing pricing policy and a need for management of work-
ing capital. These filters produce a variance exception report. The production supervisors
are expected to make a comment to the production director on the action to be taken in
respect of the variances highlighted by the filter process. Every six months I meet with the
production director to review the effectiveness of the filters being applied.
We now move on to consider the practical problems of calculating variances when
the level of output is different from that expected at the time the budget was set.
22.11 Flexible budgets and variance analysis
One of the most commonly occurring problems in variance analysis is deciding which
benchmark to use as a basis for comparison. When the standard costs are set at the
beginning of a reporting period, they will be presented in the form of a budget based
on activity levels expected at that point. Suppose activity levels subsequently fall
because of a downturn in demand? Is it preferable to base the variance analysis on 
the standard set for the original level of output, or to introduce some ﬂexibility and

Chapter 22 Standard costs
629
compare actual outcome with the standard expected for the new lower level of 
activity? Putting the question in that form leads to an almost inescapable conclusion
that ﬂexibility is required, but it is surprising how that obvious need for ﬂexibility may
be overlooked when a table of ﬁgures appears on a page. A case study is now used to
show the application of a ﬂexible budget.
22.12 Case study: Brackendale Ltd
Case study description
When the standards for the year ahead were set, it was expected that monthly 
output of units manufactured would be 10,000 units. By the time July was reached,
output had fallen to 8,000 units per month because of a fall in market share of sales.
Table 22.4 reports the original budget and the actual outcome for the month of July.
The original budget is based on a standard direct material cost of £4 per kg of raw
material, a standard direct labour cost of £10 per hour and a standard variable cost
rate of £6 per direct labour hour. Each unit of output requires 0.5 kg of raw materials
and 6 minutes of labour time. The actual cost of direct materials was found to be 
£4.40 per kg, the actual cost of direct labour was found to be £11 per hour and the
actual variable overhead cost rate was £5.60 per direct labour hour. 3,800 kg of
materials were used and the actual labour hours worked were 1,000.
Data relevant to the month of July are set out in Table 22.4, as follows:

Fiona McTaggart now talks through the problem.
FIONA: It is quite tempting to compare these two columns of figures directly and call the
difference the cost variance. But that would be totally misleading because the budget is
based on 10,000 units of output and the actual output was down to 8,000 units. Direct
materials, direct labour and variable overhead are all variable costs which depend on the
level of output. The first step I would take is to introduce a new column headed ‘flexible
budget’ which shows the expected cost of all variable costs if the standard costs per unit
are applied to the new output level. Then I would prepare a data analysis sheet so that 
I am clear in my own mind what the materials and labour quantities are for the new output
level. From there, I would analyse the direct materials cost variance into a price variance
and a usage variance based on the new output level. Similarly I would analyse both direct
labour cost and variable overhead cost variance into rate variance and efficiency variance
based on the new output level. Fixed overhead would be analysed in terms of an expendi-
ture variance only. Finally I would write a brief report setting out some guide to the figures
so that the production supervisor can give some thought to possible causes.

Fiona’s working notes are now set out in detail. Italics are used in each table to
show where she has calculated a new ﬁgure using the data already provided. You
should follow her workings through the tables and check that you understand how
the ﬁgures in italics have been calculated.
22.12.1
Summary statement of variances
The summary statement of variances (see Table 22.5) takes the information for 
original budget and actual costs contained in the case study description. The ﬂexible
budget is created by taking 8/10ths of the original budget costs (because the units
manufactured are 8/10ths of the volume originally budgeted). The variances are then
calculated by deducting the actual costs from the ﬂexible budget ﬁgures. Italics are
used to show the ﬂexible budget ﬁgures which have been calculated as 8/10ths of the
original budget. The only exception is ﬁxed overhead cost, where it would not be
expected that the cost was variable. Accordingly there is no ﬂexibility with regard to
ﬁxed overhead.

Direct materials variance
Total cost variance = standard cost minus actual cost (all based on the new output level)
= £16,000 minus £16,720
= £720 adverse variance
The variance is adverse because the actual cost is greater than the standard allowed
by the ﬂexible budget for the output of 8,000 units.
Price variance
Usage variance
= AQ (SP −AP)
= SP (SQ −AQ)
= 3,800 kg (£4.00 −£4.40)
= £4.00 (4,000 −3,800)
= £1,520 adverse variance
= £800 favourable variance
The price variance is adverse because the actual price per kg is greater than the stan-
dard price per kg. The usage variance is favourable because the actual quantity used,
3,800 kg, is less than the standard allowed, 4,000 kg, for the actual level of output.
22.12.4
Direct labour variance
Total cost variance = standard cost minus actual cost
= £8,000 minus £11,000
= £3,000 adverse variance
The variance is adverse because the actual cost is greater than the standard allowed
by the ﬂexible budget for the output of 8,000 units.
Rate variance
Efficiency variance
= AH (SR −AR)
= SR (SH −AH)
= 1,000 hours (£10.00 −£11.00)
= £10.00 (800 −1,000)
= £1,000 adverse variance
= £2,000 adverse variance
The direct labour rate variance is adverse because the actual rate is higher than 
the standard rate per hour. The direct labour efﬁciency variance is adverse because 
the actual hours worked (1,000) were greater than the standard allowed (800) for the 
output achieved.

Variable overhead variance
Total cost variance = standard cost minus actual cost
= £4,800 minus £5,600

The variance is adverse because the actual cost is greater than the standard allowed
by the ﬂexible budget for the output of 8,000 units.
Rate variance
Efficiency variance
= AH (SR −AR)
= SR (SH −AH)
= 1,000 hours (£6.00 −£5.60)

= £1,200 adverse variance
The variable overhead rate variance is favourable because the actual rate is less than
the standard rate per hour. The variable overhead efﬁciency variance is adverse
because the actual hours worked (1,000) were greater than the standard allowed (800)
for the output achieved.

Fixed overhead variance
The ﬁxed overhead expenditure variance is equal to the budgeted ﬁxed overhead
minus the actual ﬁxed overhead. That has already been shown to be £500 adverse due
to overspending compared with the budget.

Variance report
From the foregoing calculations a variance report may be prepared. This brings to 
the attention of the production manager the main items highlighted by the process of
variance analysis, as shown in Exhibit 22.8.

To: Production manager
From: Management accountant
Subject: Variance report for July
During the month of July there were 8,000 units manufactured, as compared with 10,000
expected when the budget was set. Allowing flexibility for the lower level of output, there
was nevertheless an adverse variance of £5,020 for the month, of which £720 related
to direct material, £3,000 related to direct labour, £800 related to variable overhead and
£500 related to fixed overhead.
The most serious of these is clearly the direct labour variance, where adverse changes
in labour rate contributed £1,000 and less efficient working contributed £2,000 to the
total £3,000. The direct materials cost variance of £720 looks worse when decomposed
into an adverse price variance of £1,520 offset partially by a favourable usage variance
of £800. The variable overhead cost variance of £800 adverse also looks worse when
decomposed into an adverse efficiency variance of £1,200, partly offset by a favourable
rate variance of £400. Overspending on fixed overheads was £500 for the month.

Copy out the data for the foregoing case study, close the book and attempt the variance
analysis yourself. This will test your understanding of the technical material. Make a note
of any problems or difficulties and consult your tutor about these.
22.13 Is variance analysis, based on standard costs, 
a useful exercise?
Academic opinion is divided on the usefulness of variance analysis. Solomons5 has
claimed that standard costing probably represents the greatest advance in accounting
since the development of bookkeeping. There is another view that perhaps this his-
torical leap forward has given standard costing more importance than it deserves. In
this chapter the standard has been portrayed as a single ﬁgure, but it is actually an 
estimate based on the best expectations of the future conditions envisaged in the
organisation. If the organisation has a stable technology and works within safely
attainable levels of productivity, then there is relatively little likelihood of ﬁnding that
the expected cost is far away from the true cost. But if the organisation is much riskier
in the nature of its operations, perhaps using a less stable technology and working at
the upper limits of productivity, then the expected standard cost may be an average
measure of a wide range of possible outcomes.
Anthony and Govindarajan6 questioned whether any scientiﬁc enquiry into variance
analysis is in reality carried out and have questioned further whether such enquiry is
worth doing in any event. They identiﬁed, in practice, a strong intuitive approach to
variance analysis.
It may be that accountants tend to overemphasise their own importance. The causes
and control of variances lie with those managing and operating the technical aspects
of the business. Management accountants only present the information which, if in a
Exhibit 22.8 continued
While the investigation of these problems is a matter for yourself, I might venture to
suggest that from past experience we have noticed that a favourable materials usage
variance may arise when employees are instructed to work more carefully and, as a
consequence, take longer time, which leads to an adverse labour efficiency variance. 
If that is the case, then the more careful working has had an overall negative effect
because the £800 favourable materials usage variance must be compared with the
£2,000 adverse labour efficiency variance and the £1,200 adverse variable overhead
efficiency variance.
The variance in materials price is almost certainly due to the recent increase in the price
of goods supplied. That is not a matter we can control from within the company and the
standard cost will be revised next month.
The variance in labour rate is due partly to a recent pay award not included in the
original budget, but it is also due to employees being paid at overtime rates because of
the extra time spent on working more carefully with materials. There may need to be a
major review of how this part of the business is operating, with a view to minimising
total variance rather than taking items piecemeal.
Although the variable overhead rate variance is favourable, the categories of variable
overhead will be reviewed to see whether any of the standard costs are out of date.
Overspending on fixed overhead was due to a change in the depreciation rate of
equipment due to revised asset lives. The budget will be revised at the half-yearly
review which is coming up next month.

relevant and useful form, may help in identifying cause and establishing better 
control. Setting standards is ﬁrst and foremost an industrial engineering problem. It
might be safer to leave the variance analysis to the engineers and forget about the 
cost aspects.
Chapter 16 instanced the management functions of planning and control, and the
importance of communication and motivation. Well-planned variance reports, based
on up-to-date and realistic standards, will provide information for the planning pro-
cess, encourage control and communicate the effects of operational actions on the costs
of the organisation. Motivation will be enhanced if the variance report is seen to be
speciﬁc to the information needs of each level of management and if the standard costs
are seen to be a fair measure of expected achievement. Motivation could be reduced
by a badly designed or carelessly implemented variance report.
Chapter 16 listed three management accounting functions of directing attention,
keeping the score and solving problems. Standard costs contribute to all three, when
used in conjunction with variance analysis. The variance report, by using predeter-
mined ﬁlters, may direct attention to areas of signiﬁcance. The preparation of the
report, on a regular basis, is a vital part of the score-keeping operation. Analysis of the
variances, to which the management accountant will make a contribution in deciding
on the level of detail, will be a problem-solving exercise requiring logical and system-
atic analysis of the problem represented by the accounting ﬁgures.
22.14 A broader view of applications of variance analysis
At the start of the chapter a list was set out of ﬁve ways in which standard costs may
be used by an organisation:
1 to provide product costs for stock valuation;
2 to increase control within a budgeting system;
3 to gauge performance of a business unit by use of variance analysis;
4 to integrate costs in the planning and pricing structure of a business;
5 to reduce record-keeping costs when transactions take place at different prices.
Are these purposes useful? Is it worthwhile to make the effort of developing standard
costs? Some brief answers are now provided.
l The objective of providing product costs for purposes such as stock valuation falls
within the general heading of ‘What should it cost?’, a question which in turn leads
to more questions about the effective use of resources. It is as important to ask ques-
tions about the cost of goods not sold as it is to look at the variance in cost of the
goods which have been sold. If stock is valued at actual cost, it will carry with it a
share of the problems which led to a cost variance and will burden the next report-
ing period with those problems. If the stock is valued at standard cost, all variances
in price are dealt with in the period when they arose.
l A budgeting system may be based on actual costs, but it will have greater useful-
ness if it is based on standard costs as a measure of the predetermined targets for 
a period. A budget relates to an activity or operation as a whole, while a standard
cost is a cost per unit which gives a very precise focus to the budgetary planning
process. Budgets do not necessarily need to be based on standard cost, but the 
standard costs bring additional beneﬁts in allowing the organisation to examine
more precisely how the budget compares with the actual outcome.
l Performance is gauged by comparing actual costs with standard costs and
analysing the differences. The resulting variance may indicate where, in the control
of the organisation, future action is required. Performance may be related to

QUESTIONS
The Questions section of each chapter has three types of question. ‘Test your understanding’
questions to help you review your reading are in the ‘A’ series of questions. You will find the
answers to these by reading and thinking about the material in the book. ‘Application’ questions
to test your ability to apply technical skills are in the ‘B’ series of questions. Questions requiring
you to show skills in problem solving and evaluation are in the ‘C’ series of questions. A letter
[S] indicates that there is a solution at the end of the book.
responsibility so that the management accounting information is matched to the
management aims of the organisation.
l Planning and pricing are aspects of long-term decision making which require a
strategic outlook on business problems. Pricing will usually be a forward-looking
activity based on estimated costs and out-turns. Standard costs provide a bench-
mark against which to plan pricing and, in retrospect, to evaluate the success of a
pricing policy in terms of recovering costs incurred.
l If all costs are recorded on a standard basis, then the variations in quantity may be
separated analytically from the variations in price. In practice the price variations
are isolated as soon as the goods are purchased. Thereafter, the progress of costs, in
moving through to ﬁnished goods and to output in the form of sales, is all monitored
at standard cost so that the emphasis is on quantity and variations in quantity. That
reﬂects the control process in that, once the goods have been purchased, or services
paid for, there is no further opportunity to take action over price. Success in cost
control thereafter depends entirely on control of usage, which is in the hands of
those controlling and carrying out operations.
22.15 Summary
In this chapter we have shown how control through the use of standard costs per unit
leads to a more speciﬁc analysis than is available where control is through the use of
budgets. Budgets give only the total cost of each line item. Standard costing allows
decomposition into cost per unit and quantity of units.
Variances have been deﬁned and illustrated for:
l direct materials (total cost variance, analysed into price and usage variances)
l direct labour (total cost variance, analysed into rate and efﬁciency variances)
l variable overhead (total cost variance, analysed into rate and efﬁciency variances)
l ﬁxed overhead (expenditure variance only).
Flexible budgeting has also been explained, showing that where the level of output
is different from that expected when the budget was prepared, the standard costs
should be used to prepare a new ﬂexible budget for the new level of output. All 
variable costs should be recalculated to reﬂect the change in output. Fixed overhead
costs are independent of activity level and therefore have no ﬂexibility.
The chapter has also given some ﬂavour of the debate on the importance and 
usefulness of standard costs. They are widely used but, to be effective, must be chosen
with care to meet the needs of the business and of the management purposes of 
planning and control.

At the end of the year, the production director made the following report to his colleagues on
the board of directors: ‘We budgeted for £750,000 overhead cost based on 500,000 direct
labour hours. We incurred £660,000 actual cost but only worked 440,000 hours. This appears
to me to be a satisfactory proportionate reduction in costs and there are consequently no
adverse variances from budget to be explained.’
The other directors felt this comment ignored the distinction between fixed overhead cost and
variable overhead cost. They were also concerned that the production director referred only to
the fall in direct labour hours worked, when it was known that some overheads depended on
the number of machine hours worked. They asked for a more detailed analysis of the expected
level of overhead costs in relation to the activity levels achieved.

Tesco plc Balanced Scorecard
In an offer document dated June 2012, Tesco
plc explains that the business operates a
‘Steering Wheel’ – a balanced scorecard
process whereby it sets goals for different
areas of its business and assesses its overall
progress on a quarterly basis – in all countries
and significant business units to help manage
performance and deliver business strategy.
In this Real World Case you can read an
extract from a Financial Times article followed by an illustration from the web pages of Tesco plc.
Extract from Financial Times article
The Business in the Community Corporate Responsibility Index was designed to identify new,
emerging trends among early adopters. The latest results reveal that organisations are starting to link
executive bonuses to the achievement of responsible business targets. This promotes the importance
of corporate responsibility and assists in embedding its practices throughout the business.
. . . .
Tesco is one company that is leading the way in this area. Its core purpose and values are the
foundation of a balanced scorecard, which drives the day-to-day management of the business and
prioritises its key issues. It consists of five segments: community, operations, people, finance and
customer. Every year, performance targets are set against each of the segments.
‘“Community” is the Tesco term for what others call “corporate responsibility” or “sustainability”,’
explains Lucy Neville-Rolfe, the company’s corporate and legal affairs executive. ‘It is very motivating
for everyone who works here that we include community and climate change targets in our
performance framework. It is good for Tesco and good for society.’
For example, store managers report on carbon reduction targets, as well as community initiatives. 
The bonuses of executive directors on the board are linked to the company’s corporate responsibility
performance. ‘Inclusion of community and climate change targets in our performance framework is
one of the things that differentiates Tesco,’ says Ms Neville-Rolfe.

23.1 Introduction
This management accounting text has been based throughout on the view that those
who manage a business have a need and a desire to make informed judgements and
decisions. In a continuing cycle of management action, there will be a judgement, from
which a decision will be formed, followed by evaluation of that decision and a new
judgement based on that evaluation. The stage at which the decision is evaluated
requires management accounting to exercise its score-keeping function by devising

Part 8 Planning and control
646
quantitative measures of performance. It also calls on management accounting to
direct attention to those areas most urgently requiring a judgement and a further 
decision. Management functions have been described in Chapter 16 in terms of 
planning, decision making and control.
Planning is sometimes referred to as feedforward control. This means making 
predictions of outputs expected at some future time and then quantifying those pre-
dictions, in management accounting terms. The budgetary process (Chapter 21) and
setting standards (Chapter 22) are examples of management accounting approaches
which have a feedforward (or planning) aspect. Feedforward control systems are very
effective, if carried out well, because they anticipate problems rather than wait for
them to happen.
Chapter 22 also dealt with variance analysis as a technique for control in com-
paring the actual outcome with the standard expected. This is sometimes referred 
to as feedback control. This is useful for looking back at what went wrong (or 
what went well) and for taking corrective action to ensure that a problem does not
continue.
In this chapter we consider feedback control in more depth, which involves compar-
ing outputs achieved against outputs desired and taking corrective action if necessary.
To provide this type of control it is essential to identify the responsibility for the costs
and for taking whatever action is required. The term responsibility centre is used to
identify the unit to which a feedback report is to be made. A responsibility centre
could be a cost centre where the individual manager has responsibility only for 
costs, a profit centre where the individual manager has responsibility for costs and 
revenues, or an investment centre where the individual manager has responsibility
for costs, revenues and investment in assets. (Cost centre, proﬁt centre and investment
centre are deﬁned in Chapter 17.)
Definitions
Feedforward control means making predictions of outputs expected at some future time
and then quantifying those predictions, in management accounting terms.
Feedback control involves comparing outputs achieved against outputs desired and
taking corrective action if necessary.
A responsibility centre is an area of responsibility which is controlled by an individual. 
It might be a cost centre, a profit centre or an investment centre.
In any control process, feedforward or feedback, there are three essential elements:
1 there must be objectives which state the aim or purpose of the control;
2 there must be a model which can be used to predict an expected outcome;
3 there must be power to act in order to take corrective action.
In addition, for feedback control there must be the ability to measure the actual 
outcome on the same basis as the predicted outcome.
For a feedback control system to be effective, the following basic principles should
be observed:
l the beneﬁts from the system should exceed the costs of implementing it;
l the performance criteria being measured should be reported promptly so that rapid
action may be taken;
l reports should be as simple as possible and readily understood;
l reports should highlight the signiﬁcant factors requiring management attention;
l the reporting framework should be integrated with the organisational structure so
that responsibility is identiﬁed correctly.
The operation of feedback control will be explored in this chapter in relation to
short-term decision making. (Feedback on long-term decision making will be covered

Chapter 23 Performance evaluation and feedback reporting
647
in section 24.8.2.) First, in this chapter we discuss the nature of the report to be written
for performance measurement purposes.
23.2 Preparing performance reports
There are three basic questions in relation to report preparation:
1 To whom should the report be addressed?
2 What should be reported?
3 How frequently should the report be presented?
23.2.1
To whom should the report be addressed?
In the context of the management of responsibility centres, the report should be
addressed to the manager in charge of the responsibility centre. That could be a cost
centre, a proﬁt centre or an investment centre. If the report is to have meaning for the
manager concerned, it must include only those costs which may be controlled by the
manager of the responsibility centre.
The level of detail in the report will be inﬂuenced by the managerial position of the
person to whom it is addressed. Reports to senior management will be condensed so
that those managers can see the broader picture. They will of course also have access
to the more detailed reports, should they so wish.
23.2.2
What should be reported?
The report should be designed to identify clearly those items that are controlled by the
manager of the particular responsibility centre. If the responsibility centre controls the
price and quantity of an item, then both should be reported and the combined effect
quantiﬁed. If the responsibility centre controls quantity but not the price of an item,
then the report should be designed to emphasise the quantity aspects of transactions
in the reporting period.
It could be that, despite a lack of direct responsibility, it would be helpful for the
manager of the responsibility centre to be aware of all the costs incurred as a result of
the activity of the centre. If that information is felt to be useful, then it could be
included in the report, but subheadings would be required to make clear the distinc-
tion between controllable and non-controllable costs.
The design of the report is extremely important because the manager of the cost
centre, proﬁt centre or investment centre will not use the report effectively if it does
not provide useful information in a helpful manner. Managers should be consulted 
on design of reports, and there should be trial periods of experimentation with a new
design of report before it comes into routine use. Graphs, bar charts and pie diagrams
may be ways of communicating more effectively than through tables of ﬁgures alone.
23.2.3
How frequently should the report be presented?
The frequency of reporting should be related to management’s information needs.
There may be a need for information on a daily basis. Computers provide on-screen
access to information so that the traditional concept of a reporting period, with a
printed report at the end of each period, may no longer be appropriate in all circum-
stances. There is, however, a danger in reporting all items too frequently. Reports have
to be read and acted upon, and reporting which occurs too frequently could result in
too much time being spent on the review activities.

Activity 23.1
Part 8 Planning and control
648
The question of frequency of reporting is perhaps best answered in terms of the 
frequency of the cycle of review and corrective action. If daily action is required in an
operation, then daily provision of information about the activity will allow corrective
action at the earliest possible opportunity. If a monthly review cycle is more appro-
priate, then the reporting system should be designed to provide monthly summaries.
It is vitally important that, whatever the frequency chosen, the reports are produced
in a timely manner.
If a computer is in use to record costs and quantities, then the program should be
such that the reports required are generated as part of the process so that there is no
delay in transferring information for reporting purposes.
Look back to the variance report on Brackendale presented in Chapter 22, p. 632.
Comment on the good and weak points of that report, in the light of the first two 
sections of this chapter, and suggest ways in which the report could be improved.
23.3 Performance evaluation
Performance evaluation requires the management accountant to carry out the follow-
ing process:
l decide on what to measure
l plan how to report
l consider the behavioural aspects.
23.3.1
What to measure
In looking at what to measure, we will draw on the material of previous chapters,
selecting aspects of management accounting which lead to a measure of performance.
Because each management accounting technique serves a different purpose, the 
decision on what to measure will also depend on the intended purpose and will be
discussed in the context of speciﬁc applications.
23.3.2
How to report
In planning how to report, the general principles applied will be those of responsi-
bility and the separation of controllable and non-controllable costs. All costs are 
controllable at some level of management but they may not be controllable at a 
lower level. Breaking down cost into the separate elements of quantity and price, the
extent of control may vary for each element. There will be those in the organisation
who have authority to acquire resources, thus controlling quantity and price. There
will be others whose job it is to make use of the resources acquired, in which case they
will control only the quantity element of cost. There will be others again whose job is
to ﬁnd the best price for resources. They will control only the price element of cost.
It is important to distinguish controllable from non-controllable costs when seeking
to establish responsibility for costs. Frequently, the responsibility will be shared, and
it is important that the sharing is correctly identiﬁed.
Definitions
A controllable cost is a cost which is capable of being regulated by a manager within a
defined boundary of responsibility.
A non-controllable cost is one which is not capable of being regulated by a manager
within a defined boundary of responsibility, although it may be a cost incurred so that the
responsibility may be exercised.

Activity 23.2
Chapter 23 Performance evaluation and feedback reporting
649
Performance reporting is partly concerned with planning and control, so the idea 
of controllable and non-controllable costs is important. However, it is also applied in
decision making, and further classiﬁcations into relevant/non-relevant and avoidable/
unavoidable costs may therefore also be used within the same report.
When a decision is taken there is usually more than one option available. Avoidable
costs are those costs that may be saved by not taking a particular option. Unavoidable
costs will not be saved by such an action.
Definitions
An avoidable cost is one which may be eliminated by not taking a particular option.
An unavoidable cost will not be eliminated by taking a particular action.
23.3.3
Behavioural aspects
Performance evaluation has behavioural aspects because measurement of performance
has a direct impact on the organisation’s perceptions of how its staff are performing
and on the individual staff member’s perception of their relative performance. 
As a general guide, favourable reactions to performance reporting are likely to be
maximised if staff are made aware in advance of how the performance measures 
will be calculated and how the responsibility for costs will be allocated. If the indi-
vidual has control over quantities and prices, then that person should be regarded 
as having control over, and responsibility for, that item. If the individual has control 
over quantities but not prices, then it may be appropriate to report the cost to that 
individual but only regard responsibility as extending to the quantity aspects. If the
individual has no control over quantity or price, then no responsibility for the cost of
that item can be identiﬁed, although there may be a separate question of whether that
item should be reported to the individual in order to heighten awareness of the impact
of non-controllable costs.
You are the team leader for a group of social workers who specialise in dealing with the
needs of elderly persons in their homes. You have been told by your line manager that
your team’s budgeted spending limit will be exceeded by the end of the year if you
continue with the present level of activity. The major items of cost are: team members’
salaries, travel to clients’ homes for visits and a charge from the local authority for the
provision of office facilities. Salaries have increased because of a national pay award not
allowed for in the budget. Travel costs have increased over budget because of fuel price
increases. The local authority has kept the charge for office facilities within the budget.
Your line manager has some discretion to make savings under one expense heading to
match overspending under another. How will your team explain its performance in the
end-of-year report?
Chapter 22 concentrated on the technical aspects of cost control by way of variance
analysis. There also needs to be a concern with the human implications of variance
analysis. It may be that the variance analysis approach is seen as a means of mana-
gerial review of subordinates, in which favourable variances receive praise and adverse
variances are seen as a cause for corrective action to be taken. That approach may have
undesirable consequences for a number of reasons:
1 Employees may reject standards because they were not adequately consulted in 
setting them.
2 Those under review may divert their efforts into minimising the adverse variances
rather than making positive steps towards overall performance improvement.
3 Negative feedback may reduce motivation, leading to reduced effort and lower 
performance levels.

Activity 23.3
Part 8 Planning and control
650
Those who are concerned at these negative aspects of traditional variance analy-
sis have suggested that there may be a need for accounting systems which are 
less evaluative in approach. The emphasis should perhaps move to learning and
improvement rather than stressing personal responsibility, accountability and past
achievement. Later in this chapter there are some ideas about performance measure-
ment using non-ﬁnancial measures which may be more relevant than ﬁnancial 
measures at the individual manager level. First, however, a case study is used to illus-
trate the traditional variance analysis approach to performance evaluation and 
control.
You are the financial manager of a school where some teaching departments are
spending more than their budget allowance on materials and others are being frugal and
spending less. It is six months into the financial year and you would like to give a warning
to the overspenders, but also find out why there are underspenders. Suggest two ways 
of dealing with this problem, of which one way would probably create friction between
yourself and the teachers, while the other would encourage the teachers to work with 
you in controlling the overall budget for the school.
23.3.4
Case study: evaluating and reporting performance
Fiona McTaggart now explains a situation where she prepared performance reports
using ﬂexible budgets and also shows how the performance report appeared in 
each case.
FIONA: My client was in a manufacturing business which produced hand-crafted cane 
furniture. I was asked to devise a monthly performance reporting system which would pro-
vide performance measurement of the manufacturing activity. Three levels of reporting
were required. The managing director required a brief summary of any matter requiring
executive action but did not want all the details each month. The furniture supervisor
needed a much more specific analysis of the performance of the activity as a whole and
the relative performance of each employee. There was also a proposal to give each
employee a personal performance statement that showed some indication of the average
performance of the activity as a whole, without giving individuals access to information
which was best kept personal to each employee.
The budget was set at the start of the year based on average monthly output of 300
chairs and 80 tables. In practice the actual monthly output varied around this average. 
I recommended a three-column form of report which would show the original budget 
for one month’s output, the flexible budget showing the costs expected for the actual level
of output achieved and the actual costs incurred.
I made a list of all the costs incurred in making cane furniture. The main direct costs
were materials and skilled labour. Although the employees were employed on full-time
contracts, it was useful to identify separately the time they spent in productive activity mak-
ing the furniture, which I classed as a direct cost, and the time they spent in non-productive
activity, which I classed as an indirect cost.
I then listed all the indirect costs and subdivided them according to various levels of
responsibility. Each employee was responsible for a portion of indirect materials used in
fastening the cane together and was also responsible for a portion of equipment main-
tenance and depreciation. This indirect cost was allocated in proportion to the output 
produced. It might sound rather hard that the employee’s responsibility for cost increased
as the output increased, but it was decided in discussion that staff needed to be aware of
the costs incurred when productive output takes place. Individual employees would not 
be regarded as being responsible for unproductive time unless they directly caused it as 
a result of their individual actions.

Chapter 23 Performance evaluation and feedback reporting
651
The furniture supervisor was responsible for control of the total costs allocated to the
individual operative staff, plus the cost of non-productive time (to the extent that this was
in the control of the supervisor), and the overhead costs of heating and lighting the work-
shop area.
The managing director had ultimate responsibility for all costs, including the cost of
administration, providing adequate working conditions, the employer’s share of employ-
ment costs and any non-productive work due to causes beyond the control of the furniture
supervisor.
Table 23.1 shows how the performance report was designed. There were three separ-
ate parts to the report. The first was for individual members of staff. The second was for
the furniture supervisor, who also had access to the individual staff reports, and the third
was for the managing director, who had access to the more detailed reports if these were
required.
Each report set out the variances from flexible budget for each element of cost. At the
foot of the report was a section for highlighting matters for attention and a space below for
the person receiving the report to write a comment. In the case of individual employees, a
comment was expected on any action planned in response to matters noted. This action

plan would be discussed and agreed with the supervisor. In the case of the report to the
supervisor, the comment was expected to show the action planned for the production
activity as a whole, or for individual employees where there was a particular problem. In 
the case of the report to the managing director, the comment was expected to confirm 
discussions with the supervisor but also to note any action on indirect costs regarded as
the managing director’s responsibility.
We had a trial run of this reporting format for three months, to iron out any wrinkles, 
and during that time there were some difficulties in getting the overhead responsibility 
allocation right. Everyone denies responsibility for indirect costs but, at the end of the day,
they have to be incurred and are an unavoidable consequence of business activity. It was
eventually agreed that the direct cost allocation would remain, but that, for employees 
and the supervisor, the emphasis would be on responsibility for the volume aspects of the
allocation, with any external price increases being regarded as non-controllable or else a
matter for discussion with the purchasing section.
Fiona’s description has concentrated very much on the two questions regarding
what to measure and how to report. Since she is describing the early stages of design-
ing and implementing a new system, there is no information on the behavioural

aspects of how the reporting system operated in practice. There is a description of the
trial run and the extent to which the views of participants were taken into account in
the design of the ﬁnal report. The case study would need to be followed up after a
period of, say, three months of operation, to ﬁnd out how effectively the new system
was achieving satisfactory control.

match the principles of reporting set out in this chapter.
23.4 Benchmarking
Benchmarking is the name given to the process of measuring the organisation’s 
operations, products and services against those of competitors recognised as market
leaders, in order to establish targets which will provide a competitive advantage.

The stages of benchmarking are:
1 Decide what area of activity to benchmark (e.g. customer services, business 
processes in particular departments, quality of employees, standard of training).
2 Select a competitor who is reputedly the best in the area of activity to be bench-
marked. Major companies in one country may target an international competitor
rather than a domestic company. In some benchmarking situations the competitor
may agree to an exchange of information because both parties believe they can 
beneﬁt from the exchange.
3 Decide on the appropriate measurements to be used in deﬁning performance levels.
4 Determine the competitor’s strengths and compare these with the company’s own
record.
5 Use the information collected as the basis for an action plan. To be effective, this
action plan must involve all grades of employee working in the area of activity.
The management accountant has a role throughout this process because the emphasis
is on improving proﬁt and measuring performance. The management accounting role
starts with directing attention, by producing the performance measures and showing
the relationship with proﬁt improvement. It moves into problem solving as the infor-
mation on comparative performance measures is collected and has to be transformed
into an action plan for the organisation. It then takes on the score-keeping aspect as the
achievement of total quality is monitored.
23.5 Non-financial performance measures
Within an organisation, people are employed to carry out speciﬁc activities. The only
aspect of their work over which they have direct control may well be the volume and
the quality of tasks they undertake. Applying revenues and costs to these activities
may be important for the organisation as a whole, but will have little meaning for the
individual employee who does not sell the goods or services directly and does not
purchase the input materials.
To ensure that the motivation of employees is consistent with the proﬁt objectives
of the organisation, it may be necessary to use non-ﬁnancial performance measures to
indicate what is required to achieve the overall ﬁnancial targets. Using non-ﬁnancial
performance measures does not mean that the ﬁnancial performance measures may 
be disregarded. They are ways of translating ﬁnancial targets and measures into 
something that is more readily identiﬁable by a particular employee or group of
employees.
The non-ﬁnancial performance measures should cover both quantity and quality.
23.5.1
Quantity measures
It is necessary to convert the accounting numbers to some measure of quantity which
relates more closely to individual members of an organisation. If the employees are
involved in the entire productive process, then the ﬁnancial target may be converted
to units of product per period. That approach may be more difﬁcult when a service
activity is involved or a group of employees is involved in only part of a production
process.
As an illustration of the problems of performance measurement in a service busi-
ness, take an example of a school where activities are subdivided by subject area. The
primary measure of activity will be the number of pupils taught, but the individual
departments will have no control over that number. If teaching staff are appointed

on permanent contracts, so that salary costs are largely ﬁxed costs, then the cost 
per student will vary depending on the number of students taught in any period. 
A performance measure of cost per student may be attractive to the management
accountant but will have little impact on the staff of the history department whose
main aim is to ensure that their pupils achieve high grades in the end-of-year exam-
inations. For them, examination success rates are the prime performance measure and
they will be concerned to ensure that ﬂuctuations in pupil numbers do not affect 
that success rate. A performance report on the history department would therefore
emphasise ﬁrst of all the non-ﬁnancial performance, in terms of examination success,
but would then additionally report the cost implications so that the consequences of
achieving a high, or a low, success rate could be linked to the cost of that activity.
23.5.2
Quality measures
The ultimate measure of quality is customer satisfaction. Companies will invest time
and effort in measuring customer satisfaction, perhaps by questionnaire survey or
possibly by telephone interview. Indirect measures of customer satisfaction may be
found in complaints records, frequency of repairs under warranty and level of goods
being returned as unwanted.
Another important aspect of quality is the process undertaken by the organisation.
This is so important that an external agency (often the auditors) may be employed to
provide independent certiﬁcation of the quality of the process and the controls within
the process.
Finally, quality is measured also in terms of the inputs to the process, where inputs
may be materials, labour and capital equipment. Quality of inputs may be controlled
directly by imposing standards on suppliers, or may be monitored by reviewing the
rate of return of unsatisfactory goods, the non-productive time incurred because of
faulty equipment, or the reliability of delivery dates and quantities.
Some examples of non-ﬁnancial performance measures are:
1 in respect of demand for products:
(a) number of enquiries per advertisement placed; and
(b) percentage of customers who remember the advertisement;
2 in respect of delivering the products:
(a) error-free deliveries as a percentage of total deliveries;
(b) number of complaints as a percentage of units sold; and
(c) time between receiving customer order and supplying the goods or service.

23.6 The Balanced Scorecard
Section 23.5 has illustrated some of the non-ﬁnancial measures of performance that
may be used alongside the ﬁnancial measures. There is a danger of creating increas-
ingly long lists of performance measures with no way of balancing the perspectives
resulting from these different aspects of performance. Kaplan and Norton (2001) put
forward an idea which they called the Balanced Scorecard as a way of linking perform-
ance measures. It focuses on the key goals of the organisation and the measurement 
of performance in achieving those goals.
They suggested that performance measurement can be viewed by asking four 
questions:
l How do our customers see us? (Customer perspective)
l How do our shareholders see us? (Financial perspective)
l How do we see ourselves? (Internal business perspective)
l Can we learn and grow to improve and create value? (Learning and growth 
perspective)
For each of these four questions the organisation should set major goals and deﬁne
performance measures which demonstrate that the goals are being achieved. It might
be reasonable to set three or four goals in each case. This would lead to a scorecard
that would ﬁt on a single sheet of paper. There is no speciﬁc form for the scorecard
(Figure 23.1 shows an example). Here we see the management strategy being applied
to set the goals for each section of the scorecard, and the performance measures being
used to give feedback to management on how well the goals have been achieved.

Chapter 23 Performance evaluation and feedback reporting
657
Fiona now gives an example of work she has carried out to create a balanced score-
card system in a service business.
FIONA: I have recently worked on designing a Balanced Scorecard for a company which owns
a chain of hotels in major towns and cities around the country and wanted to evaluate the
relative performance of the separate hotels. The hotels are designed to a standard model
of ‘no-frills’ value for money and comfort, with secure parking for cars. Customers are likely
to stay for one or two nights, either as business customers looking for convenience and
reasonable pricing, or as families and tourists on short-stay visits. As this was the first
attempt at creating a scorecard we used only three goals for each aspect of the balanced
scorecard. It was important to involve all staff in setting up the scorecard so we established
focus groups in each city or town to give their input to the goals and measurements. Each
focus group included an operations manager, catering and cleaning staff and a regular
customer. The result is set out in Table 23.2.
Measure
Marginal revenue from additional room
occupancy, compared with marginal costs
of creating that occupancy, with estimate of
revenue lost on third-day discount.
Cost records – monthly update of fixed
overhead actual cost against target.
Cost records – monthly report on variable
room costs compared to room rents received.
Measure
Market share surveys published in trade
journals, plus reports commissioned from
benchmarking organisations.
Customer satisfaction questionnaire left in
bedroom plus follow-up telephone enquiry.
Customer satisfaction questionnaire left in

Measure
Number of checkouts completed between
7a.m. and 9a.m. each day.
Records of laundry despatch and return.
Staff suggestion box – list of staff
suggestions and note of actions taken to
review and implement each.
Measure
Staff records of attendance and achievement
in vocational training programme.
Record of annual appraisal reviews where
appraising manager confirms that personal
development plans are consistent with
organisational goals.
Record of bulletin issues and staff feedback
on relevance and usefulness.

Kaplan and Norton soon realised that the Balanced Scorecard was more than a 
performance report. It was a useful tool in the system of strategic management. They
set out ﬁve principles for a strategy-focused organisation:
1 Translate the strategy into operational terms.
2 Align the organisation to the strategy.
3 Make strategy everyone’s everyday job.
4 Make strategy a continual process.
5 Mobilise leadership for change.
This makes the Balanced Scorecard a tool of forward planning for change, as well 
as being a retrospective view of past performance. An important aspect of using the
Balanced Scorecard is the involvement of employees in all stages of setting the score-
card and monitoring the outcome. It is ﬂexible so that the Balanced Scorecard can be
designed to be relevant to the organisation and its operations or procedures.
Imagine that you are planning to start a business operating a taxi service. Write a
balanced scorecard containing two goals and two measurements of achieving the goals
for each of the four sections of the Balanced Scorecard (Customer perspective, Financial
perspective, Internal business perspective and Learning and growth perspective).
23.7 Management use of performance measurement
This chapter has concentrated largely on how the management accountant may pro-
vide measures of performance. For such measures to have relevance in a managerial
context, they should satisfy three criteria:
1 There should be well-deﬁned performance measures which represent a range of
performance from bad to good.
2 There should be deﬁned standards of performance which indicate what is good and
what is not good.
3 There should be rewards attached to successful attainment of targets and penalties
attached to non-attainment of targets.
This section describes a case study bringing together the use of benchmarking and
performance standards to achieve the objectives and strategy of the organisation.
23.7.1
Performance measures
Fiona McTaggart describes a recent experience in establishing performance measures
through benchmarking:
FIONA: I have recently completed a project advising a parcel delivery business on establish-
ing a performance measurement system for distribution depots spread across the country.
The business has a series of warehouse depots at locations convenient to major towns.
Parcels are carried by lorry from one depot to another so that the delivery targets are met
with careful attention to cost control. The non-financial performance measure which most
concerns customers is meeting targets. Other companies in competition with this company
are also performance conscious and will publicise their performance in meeting delivery
targets. The financial performance measure which most concerns management is cost
containment in a competitive business. Depot managers find they are expected to have
regard to customer delivery targets and cost control.
My first task in advising the company was to contact a benchmarking expert in order to
find out as much as possible about the competition. The expert had plenty of information

Chapter 23 Performance evaluation and feedback reporting
659
on non-financial targets, including surveys undertaken by consumer organisations. The
expert also had a broad outline of the cost structure of the leading operator in the field,
which regards itself as a very well-controlled business.
Fiona emphasises here the importance of a strategic management approach, 
looking beyond the organisation, and of understanding the effective limits on targets
where there is an established leader in the ﬁeld. In the next section she explains how
the targets were set at a level which would be acceptable to depot managers while
meeting customers’ expectations.
23.7.2
Standards of performance
Standards may be set by an inward-looking process which builds on the management
perception of the performance required to achieve desired goals. Demonstrating that
such targets are achievable may require reference to the performance of previous time
periods and of similar units elsewhere in the organisation. The competitive position of
the organisation requires that standards are set by reference to performance in other
organisations. That may be relatively difﬁcult or relatively easy to obtain, depending
on the relative secrecy or openness of the sector.
Fiona McTaggart continues her description:
FIONA: After collecting all the information available, senior management decided they
wanted depot managers to concentrate on: (a) performance as a profit centre; (b) delivery
targets; and (c) sales and customer care. The system is now in place.
Performance as a profit centre requires targets for sales and costs. Each depot had 
initial targets set by reference to average performance over the past three years. The
national reporting of target achievement is achieved by concentrating on percentages
above and below target.
Delivery targets are reported according to the depot which last handled a parcel before
it reached the customer. However, where a delivery target is not met, it is permissible for
the depot manager to produce a summary of documentation showing where a previous
depot in the chain caused a delay. These summaries are reviewed by head office and a
supplementary report prepared showing bottleneck situations.
Customer care is monitored by customer feedback questionnaires. These are sent out
by head office and collected there. The questions concentrate on delivery target time, 
condition of parcel, attitude of company personnel and perceived value for money. Depot
summary reports are prepared.
Weekly reports are provided for depot managers which summarise the performance 
of the specific depot and show rankings against other depots. A narrative commentary by
the managing director makes specific mention of the highest and lowest performers and
explains how well the company is performing in relation to competitors.
Fiona has indicated that a mixture of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial performance 
measures is used to create a part of the balanced scorecard. In the next section she
comments on the rewards and penalties.
23.7.3
Rewards and penalties
If there are no rewards and no penalties it may be difﬁcult to motivate employees in
relation to performance targets. One view is that self-satisfaction in personal attain-
ment is sufﬁcient reward. Equally it could be argued that personal shame in not
achieving a target would be sufﬁcient penalty. However, more may be required.
Rewards and penalties are often difﬁcult to administer because they involve human
relations. The input of the individual must be seen in the context of the contribution

Part 8 Planning and control
660
of a team. Achieving a goal of the organisation may require team effort where it is 
difﬁcult to identify the relative contributions of each member of the team. That may be
overcome in relation to rewards by ensuring that no team member is deprived of a
reward. Application of penalties, however, is more difﬁcult because employment law
generally seeks to protect employees against unjust treatment.
Rewards and penalties are linked to motivation. It has been suggested by experts in
the theory of motivation that there are different needs at different levels of employ-
ment. Initially the employee is seeking the basic satisfaction of food and shelter 
which a paid job provides. A secure job provides safety in the longer term. Working
in an organisation with clear goals provides the security of membership of a group.
Developing personal potential in meeting performance targets leads to rewards of
respect and praise. Taking a lead in meeting the goals of the organisation is evidence
of realising one’s potential. Studies of motivation have at various times emphasised
achievement, recognition, challenge and promotion as aspects of rewards which 
motivate. Fairness (equity) is also seen as important, as is meeting expectations.
Fiona McTaggart completes her description of performance measurement in a
transport company:
FIONA: As I have already mentioned, the managing director writes a weekly letter to all depot
managers noting in particular the best and worst performers. That gives a sense of achieve-
ment to some managers and perhaps shames others into moving up from the bottom 
of the league tables. There is also a real reward of an all-expenses-paid weekend break 
holiday for the best-performing manager over the year. The difficulty with league-table-type
performance is that someone necessarily has to be bottom of the league, so while this 
system is motivating in a competitive sense, it has some negative aspects in that the per-
formance measures are relative to other depots rather than relative to achievable targets. 
I have pointed out to the managing director that there may be some demotivating aspects
to this system but he is very keen on competition and survival of the fittest.
Fiona has indicated that using performance targets for motivation is not an easy
matter and depends very much on the personalities involved.
23.8 Summary
Key themes in this chapter are:
l Feedforward control means making predictions of outputs expected at some future
time and then quantifying those predictions, in management accounting terms.
l Feedback control involves comparing outputs achieved against outputs desired
and taking corrective action if necessary.
l A responsibility centre is an area of responsibility which is controlled by an 
individual. It might be a cost centre, a proﬁt centre or an investment centre.
l The key questions to ask in designing a performance report are: to whom should
the report be addressed? What should be reported? How frequently should the
report be presented?
l The key stages in performance evaluation are: decide on what to measure; plan
how to report; and consider the behavioural aspects.
l It is important to distinguish controllable from non-controllable costs when seeking
to establish responsibility for costs.
l Benchmarking is the name given to the process of measuring the organisation’s
operations, products and services against those of competitors recognised as market
leaders, in order to establish targets which will provide a competitive advantage.

Due to a power failure, the level of production achieved was only 75% of that expected when
the budget was prepared. No adjustment has been made to the original budget because the
departmental manager claims that the power failure which caused the loss of production was
beyond his control.

Dairies Ltd operates a milk processing and delivery business. The retail distribution of milk 
is controlled by a regional head office which has overall responsibility for five geographical 
distribution areas. Each area is run by an area manager who has responsibility for ten depots.
At each depot there is a depot manager in charge of 20 drivers and their milk floats. Milk is 
bottled at a central processing plant and sent to depots by lorry.
All information regarding the operation of each depot and each area office is sent to the 
divisional head office accounting department. This department produces weekly reports to be
sent to each depot manager, each area manager and the manager of the distribution division.
A pyramidal system of reporting is in operation whereby each manager receives an appro-
priate weekly report containing the financial information on the operations for which he is
responsible.
Required
1 Explain what is meant by responsibility accounting.
2 List, giving reasons, the information which should be contained in the weekly reports to each
of the three levels of manager specified.

You are the management accountant at the head office of a company which owns retail shoe
shops throughout the country. The shops are grouped into areas, each having an area manager.
Goods for sale are bought through a central purchasing scheme administered by head office.
Shop managers have discretion to vary sales prices subject to the approval of the area man-
ager. It is the responsibility of shop managers to record on a wastage sheet any shoes which
are discarded because of damage in the shop. Shop managers have total control over the num-
ber of staff they employ and the mix of permanent and casual staff, subject to interview in the
presence of the area manager. Shop managers also arrange for cleaning of the premises and
are responsible for heat and light and other overhead costs.

Activities for study groups
Case 23.1
Lightwave Radio Ltd produces a range of products at its assembly plant. Due to recent rapid
expansion the company’s system of management control is now inadequate. The board has
established a working party drawn from all disciplines of management to develop the structure
for a new computer-based management control and reporting system.
As chief accountant, you represent the finance department on the working party and believe
that the management reporting system should be based on the division of the production pro-
cess into a series of cost centres.
Required
(a) Explain the essential features of a cost centre.
(b) Identify the main features you would expect to find in a cost control report prepared for use
at individual cost centre level.
(c) List three objections or questions which you might anticipate receiving from other members
of the working party, and explain how you would answer each.
Case 23.2
You are the managing director of Combine Ltd, a company engaged in the manufacture and
sale of refrigerators and freezers. The board of directors has agreed to reorganise the company
into two divisions – the domestic refrigerator division and the industrial freezer division. At the
next board meeting the measures to be used to monitor management performance are to be
discussed.
Prepare a five-minute presentation to your fellow directors which explains:
l the key factors to be considered in the design of financial performance measures for the 
divisional managers; and

Chapter 23 Performance evaluation and feedback reporting
665
l the use of non-accounting measures for appraising short-term divisional management 
performance.
Suggest three examples of non-accounting measures which could be used to monitor sales
performance in the company.
Case 23.3
Obtain the annual report of a large listed company. Look throughout the report for mention of
non-financial performance indicators. Having read the report, prepare a list of non-financial 
performance indicators which you think would be useful to readers in understanding more
about the company. For each indicator suggested, you should give a reason. The aim should
be to have a table of indicators covering no more than one side of A4 paper in printed form.

REAL WORLD CASE
This case study shows a typical situation
in which management accounting can be
helpful. Read the case study now, but only
attempt the discussion points after you
have finished studying the chapter.
Network Rail owns and operates Britain’s rail
infrastructure. On its website there is an
explanation of how a business may work with
Network Rail to construct a new connection
from an industrial site to the rail network.
Construction
Each project is bespoke and some
connections may involve complex changes to track and signalling arrangements. The Sponsor will
keep you fully informed and work with you to identify a scope for the development.
Early in the process, Network Rail will also appoint a Project Manager who will work closely with the
Sponsor and oversee the technical aspects up to and including building of the new or altered connection.
The first step in the process will be to assess the potential for the project. This pre-feasibility work will
include:
l technical appraisal of your plans;
l a definition of track and signalling requirements;
l an analysis of operating safety, network capacity and signalling issues;
l an outline programme, including details and duration for any line closures during construction and
signalling commissioning;
l a cost analysis;
l recommendations on the best options.
Source: www.networkrail.co.uk/construction.
Project costs
The costs for building the new connection will include:
l the cost of the physical works;
l a charge for project management;
l a charge for administrative work, which may include legal and professional services.
Chapter 24
Capital investment appraisal
Alamy Images/Dominic Burke

Further charges may also apply:
l an agreed amount to allow for contingencies arising once the project has started;
l compensation for disruption to other rail users if building the connection requires the closure of
adjacent line(s) or cancellation of train services;
l other costs arising from temporary line closures.
We will, of course, work with you to keep your costs and any disruption to the operation of the railway
to a minimum.
Factors influencing costs
The following influence the cost of new rail works:
l the unique design of each new connection, particularly where safety critical signalling systems
have to be altered;
l the heavy duty nature of the materials employed;
l the cost of disrupting a busy network – if this applies.
Your investment
Whatever the capital cost of your new freight facility:
l it will be capable of carrying millions of tonnes of freight during its life time;
l with modest maintenance, it will last for as much as 40 years;
l you will obtain rail infrastructure that is heavy duty and durable.

24.1 Purpose of capital investment appraisal
The word ‘capital’ can have more than one meaning in accounting. In ﬁnancial report-
ing in particular it is used to denote the ﬁnance provided to the business by owners
and long-term lenders. Economists use the term ‘capital’ to refer to the ﬁxed assets and
working capital of a business which are purchased with the money provided by the
owners and lenders. This chapter uses the term ‘capital’ in a manner similar to that
used by the economists.
When the managers of a business make plans for the long term they have to decide
whether, and how much, to invest in fixed assets and working capital to maintain or
increase the productive capacity of the business. They will usually be faced with
choices of projects available, each requiring a different type of investment, and only a
limited amount of ﬁnance available. They have to ask themselves a number of ques-
tions, including:
1 How many of the proposed projects are worth undertaking?
2 How much ﬁnance, in total, should we commit to new projects?
3 Where should the ﬁnance be obtained?
4 After the event, was the investment in the proposed project successful?
These questions cross an academic spectrum of study which begins in management
accounting and ends in ﬁnance. The ﬁrst and fourth of these questions are normally
dealt with in management accounting books, while the second and third form the
focus of ﬁnance books. Some books in either discipline will attempt to deal with all the
questions. This chapter focuses on the ﬁrst and fourth questions. It explains techniques
that can be applied to evaluate (appraise) an investment project in order to decide
whether it is worthwhile to start the project.
Definition
Capital investment appraisal is a process of management accounting which assists
management decision making by providing information on the investment in a project
and the benefits to be obtained from that project, and by monitoring the performance 
of the project subsequent to its implementation.
24.1.1
The role of the management accountant in capital 
investment appraisal
The management accountant’s role was set out in Chapter 16 as directing attention,
keeping the score and solving problems. In capital investment appraisal it is the role
of directing attention which is important. Information about proposed capital projects
must be presented in a way which will direct management’s attention towards the
signiﬁcant information for decision-making purposes. There will most probably be
problems to solve in terms of gathering and presenting the information. After the 
project is implemented there will be a score-keeping aspect in terms of comparing 
the actual outcome with the plans and expectations.
This chapter concentrates on the techniques of presenting information so as to
direct attention to the signiﬁcant aspects of the capital project for decision-making
purposes. It concludes with an explanation of the retrospective evaluation of a project
by a post-completion audit.
24.1.2
The assumptions adopted
This chapter makes an assumption that all future cash inﬂows and outﬂows of a long-
term project may be predicted with certainty. It also assumes that there are no taxes

Part 9 Capital investment appraisal and business strategy
672
and there is no inﬂation to cause prices to increase over the life of the project. For some
of the calculations in the chapter there is an assumption that all cash ﬂows take place
on the ﬁnal day of an accounting period. Making assumptions of this type may seem
a rather unrealistic starting point, but it is necessary to do so in order to analyse 
the principles of capital investment appraisal without having too many real-world
complications crowding in.
24.1.3
Making a decision on a capital investment
Chapter 16 contains a speciﬁcation of the processes of planning and control which are
necessary for a systematic approach to making an investment decision in locating a
new retail outlet. In general terms, that process is as shown in Figure 24.1.
Figure 24.1
Planning and control for a capital investment decision
To be successful the business must ﬁrst of all discover projects which have the
potential for success. All the management accounting in the world will not create a
successful project. The successful entrepreneur is the person who has the ﬂair and
imagination to identify projects and to see how they might successfully operate. The
role of management accounting, through the capital investment appraisal process, is
to ensure that the excitement of creating new investment opportunities does not cause
management to lose sight of the need to meet the organisation’s objectives.
24.1.4
Selecting acceptable projects
Suppose there has been a meeting of the board of directors of a company at which the
managing director has said: ‘We want to ensure that any cash we invest in a project
comes back as soon as possible in the form of cash ﬂows which give us a proﬁt 
overall and provide the cash to reinvest in the next project.’

Chapter 24 Capital investment appraisal
673
Activity 24.1
A second director has replied by saying: ‘It’s ﬁne for you to talk about cash ﬂows
but the outside world judges our success by our proﬁt record. I would like to see us
choosing projects which maximise the return on assets invested in the project.’
A third member of the board has joined in with: ‘I agree with the cash ﬂow per-
spective but I want to be sure that, at the minimum, we cover the interest charges 
we have to pay on the money we borrow to ﬁnance the project. Ideally, there should 
be cash ﬂows generated which exceed the cost of borrowing, so that we have 
surplus funds to use for investment in further projects or for increasing dividends 
to our shareholders.’
Reading carefully what each has said, it is apparent that there are similarities and
differences in the targets they would like to set. They are all looking to cash ﬂows from
the project, but the ﬁrst director is emphasising the speed of collecting cash ﬂows,
while the second director wants to convert cash ﬂows to proﬁt by deducting depre-
ciation, and the third director is more concerned about the amount of cash ﬂows in
total and whether they provide a surplus after covering all costs.
Management accounting can provide information for capital investment appraisal
purposes which would satisfy the criteria set by any one of the three directors, but
there would remain the question as to which of the three directors is using the best
approach so far as the business is concerned. Four methods of capital investment
appraisal will now be explained. These are: the payback method, the accounting rate
of return, the net present value method and the internal rate of return method. Each
management accounting technique will be described in turn and the advantages and
disadvantages of each will be discussed.
Decide now which of the three directors you think has the most desirable approach and
why you think that way. Then monitor the development of your views as you read the
chapter.
24.2 Payback method
24.2.1
Method of calculation
The ﬁrst director wanted cash invested in a project to come back as quickly as possible
in the form of cash ﬂows. To test whether this objective has been met by a capital 
project, the payback method of project appraisal is used. It provides a calculation of
the length of time required for the stream of cash inﬂows from a project to equal the
original cash outlay. The most desirable project, under the payback method, is the one
which pays back the cash outlay in the shortest time. Data are set out in Exhibit 24.1
which will be used to illustrate all the capital investment appraisal methods explained
in this chapter. An illustration of the payback calculation is provided in Table 24.1, 
and from this table of calculations it may be seen that project A offers the shortest
payback period. Thus if the most important measure of success in investment is the
recovery of the cash investment, then Project A is the preferred choice. Project C is next
in rank and Project B is the least attractive.
Definition
The payback method of project appraisal calculates the length of time required for the
stream of cash inflows from a project to equal the original cash outlay.
The payback period is the length of time required for a stream of net cash inflows from a
project to equal the original cash outlay.

Part 9 Capital investment appraisal and business strategy

24.2.2
Impact of uncertainty in real life
This calculation assumes certainty about the cash ﬂows predicted for each project.
Hopefully, as you were reading the conditions of the three different contracts set out
in Exhibit 24.1, you had some thoughts about the relative commercial risk of each proj-
ect and the risks attached to the cash ﬂows. In this chapter we do not make allowance
for the relative risks of each project, because we make an assumption of certainty of
predicted cash ﬂows but, in real life, Project C would be regarded commercially as the
high-risk option, while projects A and B provide greater certainty through having con-
tracts in place for the three-year period. Of these two, project B looks the less attractive
but leaves opportunities for casual earnings if loads can be found for the return journey.
Exhibit 24.1
Data for illustration of methods of capital investment appraisal
Data
A haulage company has three potential projects planned. Each will require investment
in two refrigerated vehicles at a total cost of £120,000. Each vehicle has a three-year
life. The three projects are:
A Lease the vehicles to a meat-processing factory which will take the risks of finding
loads to transport and will bear all driver costs for a three-year period. Expected
net cash inflows, after deducting all expected cash outflows, are £60,000 per
annum.
B Enter into a fixed-price contract for three years to carry frozen foods from
processing plants in the UK to markets in continental Europe, returning with empty
vehicles. This will require employing drivers on permanent contracts. Expected
cash inflows, after deducting all expected cash outflows, are £45,000 per annum.
C Employ a contracts manager to find loads for outward and return journeys but
avoid any contract for longer than a six-month period so as to have the freedom to
take up opportunities as they arise. Drivers will be hired on short-term contracts of
three months. Expected cash inflows, after deducting all expected cash outflows,
are £40,000 in Year 1, £70,000 in Year 2 and £80,000 in Year 3.

24.2.3
Usefulness and limitations of the payback approach
The payback method of capital investment appraisal is widely used in practice, pos-
sibly because it is relatively painless in its arithmetic. Furthermore, there is a reﬂection
of commercial realism in concentrating on projects which give early returns of cash
ﬂow. That may be important to organisations which face cash ﬂow constraints. It may
also be seen as a cautious approach to take where product markets are uncertain and
it is difﬁcult to predict the longer-term cash ﬂows expected from a product.
One major limitation of using the payback method of capital investment appraisal
as described here is that it ignores the fact that investing funds in a long-term project
has a cost in terms of the interest charges on borrowed funds (or interest forgone when
money is tied up in ﬁxed assets). Economists refer to this interest cost as the time value
of money. This is the name given to the idea that £1 invested today will grow with
interest rates over time (e.g. £1 become £1.10 in one year’s time at a rate of 10%).
Definition
The time value of money is the name given to the idea that £1 invested today will grow
with interest rates over time (e.g. £1 become £1.10 in one year’s time at a rate of 10%).
The cash ﬂows earned from a project should repay the capital sum invested, but they
should also be sufﬁcient to provide a reward to investors which equals the interest
cost of capital.
A second major limitation is that, in concentrating on the speed of recovery of cash
ﬂows, the method ignores any cash ﬂows arising after the payback date. A project
which would make a long-term contribution to the overall cash ﬂows of the business
could be sacriﬁced for short-term beneﬁts in a project with a limited time horizon.
Check that you understand fully the calculation of the payback period and its
interpretation. Write a 200-word note on the meaning and usefulness of the payback
period as a means of evaluating the suitability of a project.
24.3 Accounting rate of return
24.3.1
Method of calculation
The accounting rate of return differs from the payback method in using accounting
proﬁts rather than cash ﬂows. As you will by now have realised, the calculation of
proﬁts includes depreciation, which is an accounting allocation but has no cash ﬂow
effect. The attraction of using proﬁt in a method of capital investment appraisal is that
it links long-term decision making to proﬁt as the conventional measure of success in
business.
Definition
The accounting rate of return is calculated by taking the average annual profits
expected from a project as a percentage of the capital invested.
Average annual profit is calculated as average annual cash flow minus annual
depreciation.
Some books recommend as denominator the initial amount of capital invested
while others suggest the use of the average capital invested. Calculation of the aver-
age involves making some arbitrary assumptions about the way capital is used up

Part 9 Capital investment appraisal and business strategy
676
over the project. A simple pattern is to assume it is used up evenly. Suppose a project
requires £1,000 invested at the start, there will be nothing left at the end and the 
capital is used up equally each year. Then the average investment is £500 (which is 
the average of £1,000 at the start and £nil at the end). This book will use the initial
investment for illustrative purposes, but you should be aware that different deﬁnitions
will be used in practice and it is important to know how any return on capital has 
been deﬁned.
The data in Exhibit 24.1 may be used to illustrate the accounting rate of return as 
a method of capital investment appraisal. A straight-line method of depreciation is
applied, assuming a zero residual value, so that depreciation of £40,000 per annum
(calculated as £120,000/3) is deducted from cash ﬂows. The resulting proﬁts and
accounting rate of return are shown in Table 24.2.
Table 24.2 shows that Project C has the highest rate of return, Project A is next in
rank and Project B has the lowest rate of return. The accounting rate of return gives a
ranking of the three projects different from that given by the payback method. Project
B remains the least attractive but the positions of Projects A and C are reversed. That
is because C creates more cash ﬂow in total but the cash ﬂows of A arise earlier than
those of C.

Usefulness and limitations of accounting rate of return
The accounting rate of return is regarded as a useful measure of the likely success of
a project because it is based on the familiar accounting measure of proﬁt. It is also
regarded as useful because it takes into the calculation all the proﬁts expected over the
project life (in contrast to the payback method which ignores all cash ﬂows beyond the
payback date).
A major defect of the accounting rate of return is that it ignores the time value of
money. It makes no distinction between two projects of the same average proﬁt, one
of which gives most of its proﬁts at an early stage and the other of which gives most
of its proﬁts at a later stage.
A less serious defect, but nevertheless a limitation, is that the accounting rate of
return depends on proﬁt which, in turn, includes a subjective accounting estimate of
depreciation. That may not matter too much in an example of the type illustrated in
Table 24.2, where average proﬁts are used and straight-line depreciation is applied

Chapter 24 Capital investment appraisal
677
Activity 24.3
across all projects, but there could be situations where different depreciation policies
could distort a decision based on the accounting rate of return.
Before proceeding further, make sure that you understand fully the calculation and
usefulness of the accounting rate of return. Write a 200-word note on the limitations 
of relying on the accounting rate of return when evaluating a project.
24.4 Net present value method
The net present value (NPV) method of capital investment appraisal is a technique
which seeks to remedy some of the defects of payback and the accounting rate of return.
In particular it takes into account all cash ﬂows over the life of the project and makes
allowance for the time value of money. Before the net present value method can be
explained further, it is necessary to make a short digression into the time value of money.
24.4.1
Time value of money
If £100 is invested at 10% per annum, then it will grow to £110 by the end of the year.
If the £100 is spent on an item of business machinery, then the interest is lost. So the
act of investing leads to a lost opportunity of earning investment. The idea of applying
calculations of the time value of money is a way of recognising the reward needed
from a project to compensate for the lost opportunity.
Suppose now that you have been given a written promise of £100 to be received in
one year’s time. Interest rates are 10%. You do not want to wait one year to receive
cash and would like the money now. What is the price for which you could sell 
that promise? Most students see the answer as £90.91 intuitively, but they do not all
see immediately how they arrived at that answer. (It might be useful for you to think
out your own approach before you read the next few paragraphs. It is much easier to
work something out for yourself than to try remembering formulae which you will
forget in a crisis.)
The intuitive answer is that £90.91 is the amount which, invested now at 10%,
would grow to £100 in one year’s time. Provided the promise is a good one, there
would be no problem in selling the £100 promise for £90.91 now. Both the buyer and
the seller would be equally satisﬁed that the price reﬂected the time value of money.
Now make it a little harder. Suppose the promise of £100 was for payment in two
years’ time. What is the price for which you could sell that promise now? The answer
is £82.64 because that would grow at 10% to £90.91 at the end of one year and to £100
at the end of two years.
The calculation of the value of the promise today can be conveniently represented
in mathematical notation as follows:
Definition
The present value of a sum of £1 receivable at the end of n years when the rate of
interest is r% per annum equals:
where r represents the annual rate of interest, expressed in decimal form, and n
represents the time period when the cash flow will be received.
The process of calculating present value is called discounting. The interest rate used is
called the discount rate.
1
(1 + r) n

Part 9 Capital investment appraisal and business strategy
678
Activity 24.4
Using this calculation to illustrate the two calculations already carried out intuit-
ively, the present value of a sum of £100, due one year hence, when the discount rate
(interest rate) is 10%, is calculated as:
= £90.91
The present value of a sum of £100, due two years’ hence, when the interest rate is
10%, is calculated as:
= £82.64
The calculation using this formula is no problem if a ﬁnancial calculator or a
spreadsheet package is available, but can be tedious if resources are limited to a basic
pocket calculator. In such circumstances, some people prefer to use tables of discount
factors which give the present value of £1 for every possible rate of interest and every
possible time period ahead. A full table of discount factors is set out in the supplement
at the end of this chapter.
In this supplement, the column for the discount rate of 10% has the following 
discount factors:
At end of period
Present value of £1
1
0.909
2
0.826
3
0.751
Using the tables, for the discount rate of 10%, it may be calculated that the present
value of £100 receivable at the end of Year 1 is £100 × 0.909 = £90.90, while the present
value of £100 receivable at the end of Year 2 is £100 × 0.826 = £82.60. (There is a dif-
ference in the second place of decimals when this answer is compared with the result
of using the formula. The difference is due to rounding in the discount tables.)
Now that you are familiar with the calculation of the present value of a promised
future cash ﬂow, the explanation of the net present value method of capital investment
appraisal may be given.
Use your calculator to check the discount factors for the present value of £1 at the end 
of one year, two years and three years for a discount rate of 10%. Write a parallel table 
for 8% and 12%. Show that the discount factor decreases as the discount rate increases.
24.4.2
The net present value decision rule
The net present value (NPV) method of capital investment appraisal is based on the
view that a project will be regarded as successful if the present value of all expected
cash inﬂows is greater than, or equal to, the capital invested at the outset. It is called
net present value because, in calculation, the capital invested is deducted from the pres-
ent value of the future cash ﬂows. (Use of the word ‘net’ always means that one item is
being deducted from another.) If the present value of the expected cash ﬂows is greater
than the capital invested, then the net present value will be positive. If the present
value of the expected cash ﬂows is less than the capital invested, then the net present
value will be negative. A positive net present value indicates that the project should be
accepted, while a negative net present value indicates that it should be rejected.

Chapter 24 Capital investment appraisal

Definition
The net present value of a project is equal to the present value of the cash 
inflows minus the present value of the cash outflows, all discounted at the 
cost of capital.
Cash flows are calculated as profit before deducting depreciation and amortisation.
The NPV decision rule is as follows:
1 Where the net present value of the project is positive, accept the project.
2 Where the net present value of the project is negative, reject the project.
3 Where the net present value of the project is zero, the project is acceptable in meeting
the cost of capital but gives no surplus to its owners.
If an organisation seeks to maximise the wealth of its owners, then it should accept
any project which has a positive net present value. If ﬁnance markets are working
efﬁciently, funds will always be available to ﬁnance projects which meet or exceed
their cost of capital.
24.4.3
The cost of capital
The rate of interest used in the calculation of net present value is called the discount
rate. It is based on the cost to the business of raising new ﬁnance. This is called the
cost of capital. If the project is to be ﬁnanced only by borrowing from banks then 
the cost of capital is the rate of interest that a bank would charge for a new loan. If the 
project is to be ﬁnanced only by issuing new share capital then the cost of capital is 
the dividend yield required by investors. If the project is to be ﬁnanced by cash that
has been saved within the business, then the shareholders have allowed this saving
rather than take dividend, so the cost of capital is the opportunity cost reﬂected in the
dividend yield.
When the business ﬁnances projects by a mixture of sources of ﬁnance, the cost 
of capital is a mixture of the related costs. It is calculated by a weighted average of 
the interest rate on loans and the dividend yield on share capital. The weights used 
are based on the relative amounts of loan ﬁnance and equity ﬁnance used by the 
company. If you study corporate ﬁnance you will learn more about estimating the
weighted average cost of capital. For any exercise in this book you will be informed of
the discount rate to be used.
24.4.4
Residual value
At the end of a project’s life there may be cash ﬂows that can be collected from sale of
equipment or recovery of cash invested in inventories and debtors. Any cash ﬂows
from residual value should be included in the projected cash ﬂows and discounted
from the end of the project.
24.4.5
Illustration
The illustration in Table 24.3 sets out the data for Project A taken from Exhibit 24.1.
Table 24.4 sets out the net present value calculation, assuming a discount rate of 10%.
Based on the net present value rule Project A will be accepted as it gives a positive net
present value.

Activity 24.5
Rounding errors
The answer obtained from the discount tables (£29,160) differs marginally from that
obtained from the formula (£29,220), because the discount factors are rounded to three
decimal places. In many cases, such differences are marginal to the overall calculation
and you should not worry about them. If, in any particular case, the rounding errors
are likely to have an impact, then the formula should be used rather than the tables 
of discount factors. In real life it is questionable whether any decision should be based
on ﬁne-tuning of rounding errors. The conclusion should be clear from the overall
magnitudes being calculated and should not be dependent on differences of very
small magnitude.
If you have access to a spreadsheet package, find out whether it has a net present value
(NPV) function. If so, use the data in Table 24.3 to satisfy yourself that the spreadsheet
produces answers similar to those derived here.
Cash flow patterns assumed by the net present value calculation
It is worth pausing to analyse the cash ﬂow patterns which are assumed by the net 
present value calculation. This analysis helps in understanding when it is safe to use
the net present value approach to capital investment appraisal and when it should be
applied with caution.

Assume the investor who has provided the capital of £120,000 requires 10% inter-
est at the end of each year, to be paid out of the cash ﬂows. Assume that any surplus
cash ﬂows are retained in the business and reinvested at 10%. The accumulation of
cash generated by the project is shown in Table 24.5. The cash balance at the end of
Year 3 is £159,000, out of which the original capital of £120,000 is repaid, leaving an
actual surplus of £39,000. That surplus arising at the end of Year 3 has a present value
of £29,000 (£39,000 × 0.751) which is the answer derived earlier by the net present
value calculation (allowing for rounding differences).

Table 24.5 is provided here to illustrate one of the assumptions of the net present
value calculation which requires some thought. It assumes that surplus cash generated
during the project can be invested at the cost of capital. Whether or not that is the 
case for a particular project is more an issue for study in the area of ﬁnance, but in 
real life it is rare that the interest earned on deposited funds is as high as that paid on
borrowings. What is possible in many situations is that the surplus cash is used to start
further projects in the business and those new projects are also successful in creating
positive net present values of cash ﬂows at the organisation’s cost of capital.
Projects B and C
Now consider Projects B and C. The net present value of each project is calculated in
Tables 24.6 and 24.7.
Project C has the highest net present value, followed by Project A. Both would be
acceptable because both have a positive net present value. Project B would be rejected
because it gives a negative net present value.

In real life, obtaining ﬁnance may be difﬁcult because of temporary imbalance in 
the capital markets or because the supply of capital within the organisation is con-
strained. If the organisation is in the public sector it may be subject to a cash limit of
capital expenditure. If it is in the private sector and is a subsidiary or a division within
a group, it may be restricted by the group’s plans for total fund-raising by the group.
Such practical problems are sometimes referred to as capital rationing and will lead to
organisations devising decision rules for ranking projects. These ranking decisions
will not be explored in detail here but it is important to note that any project which is
rejected, when it has a positive net present value, will be a loss to the potential wealth
of the owners of the business.
24.5 Internal rate of return
Net present value is only one method in capital investment appraisal which takes into
account the time value of money. The decision rule is based on the absolute amount of
the net present value of the surplus generated by the project. There is some evidence
from research into the practical use of capital investment appraisal techniques that
decision makers feel more comfortable with a percentage rather than an absolute
amount. (The reason is not so clear but could be linked to the historical reliance on the
accounting rate of return as a percentage.)
The internal rate of return (IRR) is another method in capital investment appraisal
which uses the time value of money but results in an answer expressed in percentage
form. It is a discount rate which leads to a net present value of zero, where the present
value of the cash inﬂows exactly equals the cash outﬂows.
Definition
The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate at which the present value of the
cash flows generated by the project is equal to the present value of the capital invested,
so that the net present value of the project is zero.
24.5.1
Method of calculation
The calculation of the internal rate of return involves a process of repeated guessing at
the discount rate until the present value of the cash ﬂows generated is equal to the
capital investment. That guessing may be carried out by computer, asking the com-
puter to try values of the discount factor in the formula. Most spreadsheet computer
packages have the facility to perform a calculation of internal rate of return once the
initial investment and cash ﬂows have been entered on the spreadsheet.

That process of repeated guessing is extremely time-consuming if a computer is not
used. Even where a computer is used, it needs to be provided with a ﬁrst guess which
is reasonably close. For a manual process of estimation it may be easier to use discount
tables, with an aim of arriving at a reasonably close answer, rather than worrying too
much about ﬁgures beyond the decimal point.
Take, as an illustration, the data on Project A of Exhibit 24.1, repeated in Table 24.3.
The starting point for calculating IRR is to ﬁnd two values of NPV using discount rates
lying either side of the IRR. Table 24.8 sets out two such calculations. A ﬁrst guess of
20% produces a net present value which is positive. The aim is to ﬁnd the discount rate
which gives a zero net present value, so the ﬁrst guess must have been too low and a
higher discount rate of 24% is used for the second guess.

The second guess was a fortunate one because the net present value changed from
being positive at 20% to being negative at 24%. That means that the net present value of
zero must be found at a discount rate between these two rates. If the second guess had
failed to give a negative net present value, a further guess would have been required.
The actual discount rate which gives a zero net present value may now be found by
assuming a linear interval between 20% and 24%. (The interval is not exactly linear but
may be taken as approximately so over a narrow difference in rates.)
The difference between the two net present values is £6,360 −(−£1,200), that is
£7,560. The difference between the two discount rates is 4% and therefore, using 
simple proportion calculations, the net present value of zero lies at:
20% +
× 4
= 23.365%
Figure 24.2 sets out the linear relationship which is assumed in the calculation. The 
process of estimation shown there is called interpolation. In words, the formula used in
this calculation is:
+
× Difference in rates
The internal rate of return answer, as produced by a computer package, is 23.375%.
The use of a simple proportion calculation appears to provide a good approximation.
If you have access to a computer spreadsheet package which has an internal rate of
return function, test the data used in the chapter. It will ask you for a first guess and will
then proceed to repeat the calculation of IRR until it arrives at a net present value of zero.

It is also possible to plot a graph of net present value against discount rate, as
shown in Figure 24.3. The internal rate of return is the discount rate at which the 
graph crosses the horizontal line representing zero net present value. That point is
designated with a letter P in the graph and is shown to be around 23.4% by a vertical
dotted line from P to the horizontal axis.

24.5.2
The internal rate of return decision rule
The decision rule is that a project is acceptable where the internal rate of return is
greater than the cost of capital. Under those conditions the net present value of the
project will be positive. A project is not acceptable where the internal rate of return 
is less than the cost of capital. Under those conditions the net present value of the 
project will be negative.

Chapter 24 Capital investment appraisal
685
1 Where the IRR of the project is greater than the cost of capital, accept the project.
2 Where the IRR of the project is less than the cost of capital, reject the project.
3 Where the IRR of the project equals the cost of capital, the project is acceptable in
meeting the required rate of return of those investing in the business but gives no
surplus to its owners.
When the net present value and the internal rate of return criteria are applied to 
an isolated project, they will lead to the same accept/reject decision because they 
both use the discounting method of calculation applied to the same cash ﬂows. For an
isolated project the use of either technique is a matter of personal preference. Where a
choice of competing projects has to be made, the practice may be more complicated.
The techniques available for dealing with that problem are beyond the scope of this
book, but the next section outlines the nature of the problem.
24.6 Mutually exclusive projects
An organisation may need to make a choice between two projects which are mutually
exclusive (perhaps because there is only sufﬁcient demand in the market for the out-
put of one of the projects, or because there is a limited physical capacity which will not
allow both). Some care is then required in using the net present value and the internal
rate of return as decision criteria. In many cases they give the same answer on relative
ranking, but occasionally they may give different answers, as shown in the following
case example.
24.6.1
Case study: whisky distillery
A distillery is planning to invest in a new still. There are two plans, one of which
involves continuing to produce the traditional mix of output blends and the second of
which involves experimentation with new blends. The second plan will produce lower
cash ﬂows in the earlier years of the life of the still, but it is planned that these cash
ﬂows will overtake the traditional pattern within a short space of time. Only one plan
may be implemented. The project is to be appraised on the basis of cash ﬂows over
three years. The cash ﬂows expected are shown in Table 24.9. The cost of capital is 12%
per annum. At this discount rate the net present values are shown in the second table
of Table 24.9. The internal rates of return are also shown in that table.

It may be seen from Table 24.9 that, looking at the net present value at the cost of
capital, project B appears the more attractive with the higher net present value. Looking
at the internal rate of return, project A appears most attractive. Both are acceptable
because they give a positive net present value and the ideal answer would be to ﬁnd
the resources to undertake both projects. In this example, the two are mutually exclusive
(which means that taking on one project excludes the possibility of the other).
If the business has the aim of maximising net present value, then one further 
decision rule may be helpful, based on the profitability index.
Definition
The profitability index is the present value of cash flows (discounted at the cost of
capital) divided by the present value of the investment intended to produce those 
cash flows.
The project with the highest proﬁtability index will give the highest net present
value for the amount of investment funding available. Taking the data in Table 24.9,
the proﬁtability index calculations are:
Project A: Proﬁtability index =
= 1.10
Project B: Proﬁtability index =
= 1.13
This conﬁrms that, of the two, project B is preferable at a cost of capital of 12%.
Where the investment in both projects is of the same amount, as in this case, the
proﬁtability index conﬁrms what is already obvious, but where there are competing
projects of differing initial investment, it is a useful device for ranking projects to 
maximise net present value.
24.6.2
Sensitivity to changes in the discount rate
To understand the apparently different conclusions from the NPV and IRR approaches,
it is helpful to plot a graph of the net present value of each project against a range of
discount rates. The graph is shown in Figure 24.4.
From Figure 24.4, it will be seen that, for both projects, the net present value
decreases as the discount rate increases but that the net present value of project B
decreases more rapidly. Starting at the left-hand side of the graph, the net present value
of project B is higher than that of project A at all discount rates above the point, M, at
which they intersect (around 14.2%). In particular project B has a higher net present
value than project A at the cost of capital 12% (point N on the graph). For discount
rates above 14.2%, the net present value of project B is always higher than that of project
A. The internal rate of return of each project is the discount rate at which they cross the
line of zero net present value (i.e. at point P for project B and point Q for project A).
How does this help the decision maker? If it is absolutely certain that the cost of
capital will remain at 12% throughout the life of the project, then the net present value
method correctly leads to a choice of project B in preference to project A. On the other
hand, 12% is quite close to the point of intersection at 14.2%, where project A takes
over. If there is a chance that the cost of capital will in reality be higher than the 12%
expected, then it might be safer to choose project A. The line of the graph for project
A is less steep and this project is said to be less sensitive to changes in the discount
rate. There is therefore no clear-cut answer to the problem and the ﬁnal decision will be
based on an assessment of sensitivity. Looking at Figure 24.4, the different ranking by
net present value and by internal rate of return was a useful clue to the need to 
consider the relative sensitivities as shown in the graph.

24.7 Which methods are used in practice?
This chapter has now explained the capital investment appraisal techniques of pay-
back, accounting rate of return, net present value and internal rate of return. The
beneﬁts and limitations of each have been discussed in the respective sections. It could
be argued that the proof of the value of each technique lies in the extent to which it is
used in practice. There exists a considerable volume of survey research seeking an
answer to the question of which methods are most commonly used in practice. The
conclusions from each project are not totally unanimous because they depend on the
time period covered by the research, the nature of the sample chosen, the country in
which the questions are asked and the questions asked. There are themes which may
be discerned in the research results, the ﬁrst of which is that the payback method
appears to be the most frequently used technique in the UK but discounted cash ﬂow
methods are found more commonly in the USA. It is also found that organisations will
use more than one method of capital investment appraisal. Where discounting methods
are used, internal rate of return appears more popular than net present value.
Research investigations are able to collect information of this type. Once the pat-
terns are known, it is interesting to speculate on the motives behind these patterns of
choice. Perhaps the payback method is most frequently used because there are many
small businesses undertaking lots of small projects. It might not matter that discount-
ing methods are used less frequently provided they are used on the larger projects in
larger organisations. This issue has also been tested in research and it has been shown
that larger companies do make relatively more use of discounting techniques. Perhaps
the payback method, in many cases, shows so clearly that a project is acceptable that

Net present value of competing projects using a range of discount rates

Activity 24.7
Part 9 Capital investment appraisal and business strategy
688
it would be a waste of time to carry out lengthy discounting calculations to arrive 
at the same conclusion. Perhaps those using payback realise that, in some instances, 
its emphasis on early cash ﬂows is not so different from that of the net present value
approach in situations where the later cash ﬂows are relatively low.
24.8 Control of investment projects: authorisation and review
The capital investment projects of an organisation represent major commitments 
of resources. It would be a mistake to be over-enthusiastic about decision-making
techniques without also considering how management accounting may help in the
subsequent implementation of the project.
The organisation should have in place a procedure by which new project sugges-
tions are investigated and evaluated using the techniques described in this chapter, or
suitable alternatives. There should then be a decision-making group, perhaps called
the capital investment appraisal committee or the management review committee,
which makes decisions on the projects to be selected. Once the decision has been made
and the capital investment appraisal committee has authorised the project to proceed,
the management accountant is again needed in implementing a system for reviewing
and controlling the project.
The two important aspects of control and review are:
1 controlling the amount of the expenditure needed to make the project operational;
2 post-completion audit of cash inﬂows and outﬂows.
24.8.1
Controlling capital expenditure
The speciﬁcation of the project will have included an estimate of the initial outlay
required and the timing of that outlay. For simpliﬁcation, the illustrations used in this
chapter assumed a single amount being paid out at the start of the project, but in real
life the capital expenditure will be spread over a period of time on an agreed schedule.
If the capital expenditure involves constructing a building, there will be a contract 
for the building work which sets out the dates for completion of each stage and the
amount of cash to be paid at that point. The payment will only be made when an
expert (such as the architect supervising the project) has conﬁrmed that the work has
been carried out according to the speciﬁcation. If a contract has been drawn up with
care, it will contain safeguards to ensure that the work is completed on time and
within the original cost estimates. There may be a penalty clause, so that a part of the
cash payment may be withheld if the contract is not performed as promised.
Write a list of key points to be made in a recommendation to the board of directors on 
the implementation of an expenditure control process for capital investment plans.
24.8.2
Post-completion audit
A post-completion audit involves a review of the actual results of a project in order to
compare these with the expectations contained in the project proposals. It is called an
audit because it requires a more ﬂexible approach than would be found in manage-
ment accounting evaluations of short-term plans (as covered in Chapter 20). The post-
completion audit might require a view of the wider implications of the project rather
than concentrating too much on annual cash ﬂows item by item. A project might take
a different turn from that envisaged at the outset and a longer-term view would be

Chapter 24 Capital investment appraisal
689
required of the likely outcome of that different turn. In real life, uncertainty is a factor
which cannot easily be built into the project plans and the audit may have to take
account of factors which could not have been foreseen at the outset.
There could be dangers in such an audit process if managers of projects see them-
selves as being held to blame for a subsequent failure to meet expectations. They
might be motivated to put forward only those projects which they saw as safe but
unadventurous. The review process has to be ﬂexible to allow for the unknown but
also to discourage unrealistic or over-enthusiastic plans.
24.9 Advanced manufacturing technologies
Advanced manufacturing technologies (AMTs) have been developed by engineers 
as a means of competing more effectively. To compete, organisations need to manu-
facture innovative products of high quality at low cost. The product life-cycle may be
short, demand may be changing more rapidly, and international competition creates
a further element of uncertainty. As with any business activity, these changes represent
new approaches to the management of the business, and management accounting
must keep pace with the change in management approach.
24.9.1
Types of new technology
Engineers have produced new technology of four main types:
1 design innovations;
2 planning and control techniques;
3 execution; and
4 overarching technologies.
Each of these new technologies is considered in turn.
The design innovations have covered computer-aided design (CAD), computer-
aided engineering (CAE), computer-aided process planning (CAPP) and design for
manufacture and assembly. CAD uses computers to evaluate various designs of the
product, while CAE includes design but also encompasses evaluation and testing so
that the initial design becomes a working product. CAPP uses computers to plan 
the detailed processes required to manufacture the design proposed. Finally, the 
computer can also be used to design a system which makes the manufacture and
assembly process meet the demand for the output.
Planning and control techniques have covered materials requirements planning (MRP),
manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) and statistical process control (SPC). MRP
involves matching stock levels to the production process and controlling incoming
customer orders to match the availability of materials. MRP II applies similar controls
to all resources used in the manufacturing process. They both use computers to break
down a customer’s order into various stages which can be matched against resource
availability. SPC uses statistical analysis to identify the most likely causes of bottle-
necks in the manufacturing process, which can then be corrected before a crisis arises.
Execution means converting raw materials and components into ﬁnished goods. The
technologies have included robotics, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), ﬂexible
manufacturing systems (FMS) and automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS).
These titles are self-descriptive of the activities involved.
The overarching technologies are those which take a total perspective of the 
organisation. They include total quality management (TQM), just-in-time (JIT), focused
factory and computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM). TQM and JIT are described in
Chapter 25.

24.9.2
Capital investment appraisal of AMT projects
The conventional methods of investment appraisal have been presented as payback,
accounting rate of return, net present value and internal rate of return. These tech-
niques have considerable beneﬁt for many situations where a ﬁxed investment is
made and the outcome may be projected forward. However, they are not capable 
of taking into account the ﬂexibility which management may have in some situations.
As ﬂexible technology takes over from ﬁxed inﬂexible capital equipment, there are
options facing the business manager which must be considered in project evaluation.
In particular there are options to make modiﬁcations to projects or add on new
aspects. Abandonment may be less difﬁcult where technology is ﬂexible. Companies
may feel that they can afford to wait and learn before investing. A project can be scaled
down if there are changes in demand for a product. These options make project develop-
ment quite exciting but they also offer a challenge to the management accountant in
making sure the options are evaluated.
Fiona McTaggart describes an example of capital investment in an AMT situation:
FIONA: One case I encountered was that of a flexible manufacturing system being used to
machine metal into engineering components. There was hardly a person in sight on the
production line. Computer-controlled machines were each performing one part of the
treatment of the metal. Cutting tools were making metal shapes, transport systems were
moving components around and then, depending on where the shapes were delivered,
there were more machines to turn, mill, polish and shape. The whole process was con-
trolled by a host computer and was sufficiently flexible that if the transport system was
revised then the activities performed on the metal changed as well.
The company adapted its investment appraisal methods by involving the engineers and
the management accountants as a team. Essentially they evaluated reduced labour costs,
increased effectiveness in utilisation of machines, cost saving through just-in-time control
of materials and the reduction in indirect costs. Discounted cash flows were included in
order to take account of the longer term but the emphasis was more strongly on the short
term and the flexibility for change if conditions changed.
The debate on the role of capital investment appraisal techniques in relation to
advanced manufacturing technologies is a useful example of the wider point that
management accounting must continually be changing to adapt to changed circum-
stances. A book can present basic ideas, but those ideas will only work effectively in a
practical situation if moulded to meet the needs of the situation.
24.10 Summary
Key themes in this chapter are:
l Capital investment appraisal is the application of a set of methods of quantitative
analysis which give guidance to managers in making decisions as to how best to
invest long-term funds. Four methods of quantitative analysis are explained in the
chapter:
l The payback period is the length of time required for a stream of net cash inﬂows
from a project to equal the original cash outlay.
l The accounting rate of return is calculated by taking the average annual proﬁts
expected from a project as a percentage of the capital invested.

Test your understanding
A24.1
What is the purpose of capital investment appraisal? (Section 24.1.1)
A24.2
What is meant by the assumption of certainty of cash flows? (Section 24.1.2)
l The process of calculating present value is called discounting. The interest rate used
is called the discount rate. The net present value method of investment appraisal
and the internal rate of return method are both based on discounting.
l The net present value of a project is equal to the present value of the cash inﬂows
minus the present value of the cash outﬂows, all discounted at the cost of capital.
The decision rules are:
1 Where the net present value of the project is positive, accept the project.
2 Where the net present value of the project is negative, reject the project.
3 Where the net present value of the project is zero, the project is acceptable in
meeting the cost of capital but gives no surplus to its owners.
l The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate at which the present value of
the cash ﬂows generated by the project is equal to the present value of the capital
invested, so that the net present value of the project is zero. The decision rules are:
1 Where the IRR of the project is greater than the cost of capital, accept the project.
2 Where the IRR of the project is less than the cost of capital, reject the project.
3 Where the IRR of the project equals the cost of capital, the project is acceptable in
meeting the required rate of return of those investing in the business but gives
no surplus to its owners.
l Mutually exclusive projects are found wherever a choice is needed because of 
limited resources of capital, labour, materials, or any other constraint.
l The profitability index may be used to rank projects in situations of capital rationing
or mutually exclusive projects.
l Effective capital investment appraisal requires control procedures to be in place for
establishing the suitability of a project and for post-completion audit to evaluate the
success of the project.
l Advanced manufacturing technologies have led to a demand for new ways of 
evaluating investment projects because new projects may require continuous
investment of resources rather than a single outlay at the outset.

1 calculations of net present value for each project, and
2 a reasoned recommendation on maximisation of net present value within the £1,000,000
investment limit.
C24.2 [S]
The directors of Advanced plc are currently considering an investment in new production
machinery to replace existing machinery. The new machinery would produce goods more ef-
ficiently, leading to increased sales volume. The investment required will be £1,150,000 payable
at the start of the project. The alternative course of action would be to continue using the exist-
ing machinery for a further five years, at the end of which time it would have to be replaced.
The following forecasts of sales and production volumes have been made:

Further information
(a) The new machinery will reduce production costs from their present level of £7.50 per unit to
£6.20 per unit. These production costs exclude depreciation.
(b) The increased sales volume will be achieved by reducing unit selling prices from their 
present level of £10.00 per unit to £8.50 per unit.
(c) The new machinery will have a scrap value of £150,000 after five years.
(d) The existing machinery will have a scrap value of £30,000 at the start of Year 1. Its scrap
value will be £20,000 at the end of Year 5.
(e) The cost of capital to the company, in money terms, is presently 12% per annum.
Required
1 Prepare a report to the directors of Advanced plc on the proposed investment decision.
2 List any further matters which the directors should consider before making their decision.

Each project has two separate phases of equal cost and providing equal cash flow benefits. The
board is willing to consider adopting the first phase of any project without the second, if 
this appears necessary. Any project or phase not undertaken immediately may be postponed
indefinitely. Capital available for investment is limited to £300,000. The board aims, as far as
possible, to maximise the net present value of projects undertaken.
The company requires a return of 10% per annum based on the net cash flows of any project.
Required
Prepare a report to the board of directors:
1 setting out a decision rule which could be applied in ranking the investment projects, and
2 listing other factors which the board of directors might wish to consider when selecting 
projects for implementation.

Activities for study groups
Case 24.1
Using a suitable computer spreadsheet package, set up a spreadsheet which will calculate net
present values and internal rates of return for projects having cash flows for a ten-year period.
Test the spreadsheet with sample data and then write a brief instruction sheet. Save the spread-
sheet to a disk and exchange disks and instruction sheets with another group in the class.
Case 24.2
Now write an evaluation of the spreadsheet you have received from another group. Consider
the following:
(a) Does it deal with all possible types of cash flows (e.g. a negative flow at some point)?
(b) Does it provide a recommendation on accept/reject (e.g. using a conditional function)?
(c) Does it allow for relatively easy variation of the discount rate?
(d) Does the instruction sheet explain how to produce graphs of net present value plotted
against discount rate?
List any other features of the spreadsheet which you would use in evaluating its effectiveness
and user-friendliness.

REAL WORLD CASE
This case study shows a typical situation in which management accounting can be helpful.
Read the case study now, but only attempt the discussion points after you have finished
studying the chapter.
Intel warned of lower than expected revenues in the
second half of the year as PC makers hold back from
ordering its computer chips in the face of economic
uncertainty and the October launch of Windows 8.
The world’s largest chipmaker by revenues and a
bellwether for the PC industry, predicted 2012 sales
would rise around 4 per cent, down from its earlier
expectations of high single-digit growth. Its forecast
of $14.3bn in third-quarter sales was below Wall
Street expectations of $14.6bn.
Paul Otellini, chief executive, told an analyst
conference call that a recovery expected in the US and western European markets, where there had
been ‘softness’ for several quarters, had failed to materialise.
In the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, PC prices had been rising with the
value of the dollar, while China’s economic growth had been slowing.
‘While we still see growth [in China], we don’t see quite as much as we first thought,’ he said.
Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s main microprocessor rival, warned last week that its second-quarter
revenues would be down about 11 per cent on the first quarter, after previously predicting a 3 per
cent rise. It blamed softer sales late in the quarter in China and Europe, along with a weaker
consumer buying environment for PC makers.
Intel said inventory levels for its microprocessors were healthy, but were being ‘managed below
historical averages’.
Mr Otellini said Windows 8 was not appearing until the fourth quarter and PC makers had moved to
just-in-time ordering of Intel’s chips.
He was upbeat about Ultrabooks – a thin and light laptop category promoted by Intel – although
analysts view current prices of $800 and upwards as beyond the mainstream consumer.
The chief executive said more than 140 models were in the pipeline based on its latest processor,
with more than 40 touch-enabled and a dozen convertible into tablets. He was ‘very confident’ there
would be $700 systems in the market this autumn.

The company is beginning to break into tablets and smartphones. It reported the launch of Intel-
based smartphones in India, China and Europe during the quarter and said more than 20 Windows 8-
based tablets would use its processors.
Intel reported second-quarter revenues a shade lighter than expected at $13.5bn, blaming softness in
its Nand Flash memory business. Profits of 54 cents a share topped Wall Street forecasts of 52 cents.
The main strength was in its data centre group, where its ‘Romley’-codenamed server chip helped
sales grow 15 per cent year-on-year for the division. It also helped overall gross margins to increase
to 63.4 per cent, up from 60.6 per cent a year earlier.
Intel shares initially rose in after-hours trading in New York on the news before trading 1 per cent
lower at $25.15.

Chapter 25 Business strategy and management accounting
701
25.1 Introduction
In this chapter we take the theme of business strategy and the role of management
accounting. A strategy may be deﬁned as ‘an integrated set of actions aimed at securing
a sustainable competitive advantage’.1
Using this deﬁnition a strategy is something more than a long-term plan. It is a
statement of how the business intends to reach some preferred state in the future by
changing its competitive position to meet changing circumstances.
This chapter explains and illustrates some of the approaches that have been 
proposed to developing business strategy, where management accounting has a contrib-
utory role to play. You have already encountered activity-based costing (Chapter 18),
benchmarking (Chapter 23), the balanced scorecard (Chapter 23) and investment
appraisal for advanced manufacturing technologies (Chapter 24), all of which are tech-
niques developed to support strategic change. They have become an established part
of the management accountant’s contribution to ensuring that a business stays vigilant
to competitive forces.
25.2 Strategic management accounting
The successful management of a business depends on having a successful business
strategy. It has been argued that if the business strategy gives the organisation its com-
petitive edge, then the management accounting should reﬂect that strategy as closely
as possible. The traditional emphasis on costs and revenues may not achieve this aim.
What really matters is the inﬂuence of the external environment.
Strategy usually includes planning to achieve a better performance than competitors.
It is argued that management accounting should show the extent to which the organis-
ation is beating its competitors. Market share, market prospects and the impact of 
product mix would all be useful information to include in a management accounting
report as factors contributing to sales, proﬁts and cash ﬂows.
Another way of looking at the inﬂuence of the external environment is to consider
competitive advantage in costs. If the business has an inﬂuential position as a pur-
chaser of goods and services, then its strategy may include an aggressive policy of
negotiating contracts for those goods and services. The just-in-time strategy of order-
ing goods from suppliers to arrive exactly when they are needed may put strains on
the suppliers and force up their costs, increasing the price of the goods. The concept
of a value chain has been proposed to describe how the corporate strategy affects 
the entire chain of value-creating activities. Strategic management accounting might
show that £1 saved at one point in the chain has been offset by an extra £2 incurred at
another stage.
Advocates of strategic management accounting seek to provide ﬁnancial and
other related information on competitors’ costs and cost structures so that the com-
pany’s strategies may be monitored against those of its competitors over a period of
time. Furthermore there is a need for new forms of internal analysis and accounting
processes that will help management devise better strategies. There is strong support
for this general direction of strategic management accounting but less agreement on
how it may be achieved.
It is not necessary to abandon all that has been learned in the earlier chapters of 
this book. Advocates of strategic management accounting would relate the account-
ing technique to the strategic aims of the business. Take the example of two 
companies, one of which is aiming to achieve cost leadership (carrying out activities
in a more cost-effective manner than competitors) while the other is focusing on 

Part 9 Capital investment appraisal and business strategy
702
product differentiation (persuading customers that there is a unique aspect of the
company’s products). The use of standard costing in assessing performance is very
important to the cost leadership company but relatively unimportant to the product
differentiation company. Analysis of marketing costs may not be so important in 
a cost leadership setting but is absolutely essential to the product differentiation 
situation.
You have already seen the Balanced Scorecard approach which requires an organ-
isation to translate its vision and strategy into four perspectives: ﬁnancial focus, 
customer focus, internal business processes and learning and growth. Companies are
encouraged to develop performance indicators under each of these headings which
provide a complete view of the company’s performance.
Fiona McTaggart describes her experience of a situation where a strategic approach
helped a business to achieve improved performance.
FIONA: One of my clients was a telephone utility company. It was in a competitive market
where the customer base was growing fast. Costs had been reduced to the limit and 
competition focused on delivering a good quality of service to the customer.
The first action taken by management was to change the attitude of employees, moving
away from an organisation based on functions and towards an organisation based on 
process. As an example, the sales ledger department was disbanded. Some of the staff
joined a customer enquiry unit which allowed one point of contact for matters ranging 
from sales orders through repairs to accounts enquiries. Others moved to the information
technology unit which concentrated on providing information within the organisation. 
This move recognised internal ‘customers’ as well as external customers.
The next move was to invest in a training programme to encourage customer focus.
Staff joining the customer enquiry unit were all trained in customer focus but were also
made aware of the way in which their activities drive the costs of the organisation. Their
training included a course provided by benchmarking experts who had information about
the standards achieved by leading competitors. The company was quite surprised to find
how much other companies will share through benchmarking.
You might be thinking that this does not sound much like management accounting but
the focus on activities driving costs led to a rearrangement of management accounting
information to use cost drivers and activity-based costing. That approach was used to 
evaluate type of customer, geographical area of sales and types of product promotion.
The result was continued growth in sales and profit for the company and an expansion
in employment opportunities for staff.
25.3 The just-in-time approach
Just-in-time manufacturing is a methodical approach to reducing machine set-up
times, accepting only perfect incoming resources, allowing no deviation from stand-
ards and matching output exactly to the demands of the customer. Every activity
occurs exactly at the time needed for effective execution, and the activity always 
happens exactly as planned. It reduces stockholding costs, minimises idle time for 
production resources and creates a demand-driven business.
Fiona McTaggart describes her experience of a just-in-time management system.
FIONA: I recently participated in a pilot project involving a leading company manufacturing
car engines. There were two shifts planned, one using manual labour and one entirely
operated by robots. A just-in-time (JIT) philosophy applied throughout. Each item required
for the manufacture of an engine was planned to arrive on the production line at exactly the
right time. Delivery from suppliers was similarly timed with care. The computer recording

Chapter 25 Business strategy and management accounting
703
system was designed so that the arrival of the component was recorded and barcoding
allowed the cost to be recorded at the same time. There was no need to wait for an 
invoice to arrive before the cost of the component could be ascertained. Reports on direct
costs could therefore be generated simultaneously with reports on physical activity. Dealing
with overhead costs was more difficult, but a system was proposed where overhead costs
were applied to activities using an activity-based approach and a focus on machine hours
as the main measure of use of an activity.
The JIT approach emphasises elimination of waste. The management accounting report
for the two shifts had a waste exception report section which allowed rapid identification
of departure from accepted waste levels on each shift. Linking the accounting records to
the physical activity meant that each shift could be identified separately.
The pilot project was receiving a cautious welcome from the technical managers. They
had regarded traditional management accounting as an unavoidable nuisance but they
could see that the pilot scheme was bringing the accounting information closer to their
perspective of the operation.
25.4 Value chain analysis
The idea of the value chain was popularised by Porter (1998) as a way of describing
and analysing the sequence of activities that bring a product or service from its initial
stage of production to the ﬁnal stage of delivery to the customer.
In a competitive environment the business manager should ask: ‘What is our com-
petitive advantage; what do we do well?’ That requires questions about competition –
where are the threats? There could be new entrants seeking to join the sector; there
could be substitute products or services. There may be strong rivalry within the 
industry or there may be little interest in competing. Suppliers may have a strong 
bargaining position; customers may have a strong bargaining position. The manager
considers the kind of competition that exists and then plans to deal with that position.
Perhaps this business can reduce costs below those of competitors; perhaps it can ﬁnd
a way of differentiating its product to make it attractive to consumers. Porter took the
view that a business should choose either a cost focus or a differentiation focus, rather
than try to do too much at the same time.
The value chain for any business is a description of the key processes, starting with
inputs. Take the example of a plant nursery which grows plants from seedlings and
sells them to customers in a garden centre. The managers have identiﬁed the com-
petitive advantage as their reputation for growing plants that are hardy to the climate
of this region. The value chain is shown in Exhibit 25.1.
Exhibit 25.1
Value chain for nursery and garden centre
Seed selection →Growing seedlings →
Transfer to retail outlet →Advice desk →Sale to customer
Each stage of the value chain adds value for the business. It is focused on product
differentiation. The price may be marginally higher than the prices that would be
charged by national chains selling plants as part of home improvement stores, but the
customer is less likely to ﬁnd the plant has wilted and died within weeks of planting.
Advice is given to any enquirers coming into the garden centre, and the advice is
based on local knowledge.
Fiona McTaggart has been advising the business on the steps required for value
chain analysis. She explains here how she worked with management.

Part 9 Capital investment appraisal and business strategy
704
FIONA: First we identified the value chain and assigned costs and assets to each stage.
Seed selection involves labour cost and storage for seeds taken from the nursery’s own plants.
The nursery also buys in new varieties to strengthen the existing strains. Growing seedlings
involves further labour cost, greenhouse maintenance, security and plant care materials.
There is also a wastage rate to be built in. Transfer to the retail outlet involves transport costs
and a risk of loss through inadequate handling. The advice desk is a heavy labour cost specific
to this business. The retail sales outlet carries costs similar to those of any retail operation.
Next we considered the cost drivers of each value activity and the interaction of cost
drivers. Then we considered the value chains of competitors who can undercut the busi-
ness on price but compete less well on product durability. We worked out the relative costs
and looked at ways for this business to cut its costs. For example, transferring plants to the
garden centre on a just-in-time basis would reduce wastage but requires customer surveys
to know when the peaks of demand will arise. We were able to identify some areas for cost
control that would enable the business to remain competitive on price without eroding the
product differentiation. The managers are pleased that they have this approach to focusing
on how they add value at each stage of the chain.
25.5 Total quality management and cost of quality
The success of Japanese companies in the later 20th century has caused intense 
interest in Japanese styles of management. One aspect of Japanese management is the
approach of ‘get it right ﬁrst time’. In this spirit, total quality management (TQM) has 
the customer as its focal point.
Quality is deﬁned as fully satisfying agreed customer requirements at the lowest
internal price. TQM is therefore a management function which could be added to
those explained in Chapter 16. It straddles the traditional management functions of
planning and control. The use of the TQM approach is seen as the key to improving
proﬁtability because there is a cost associated with failing to meet quality standards in
products and services. Such costs could arise through loss of customers, claims for
refunds in respect of defective supplies, and the work of putting right mistakes. 
If costs can be controlled through TQM, then proﬁts will increase.
Those who are enthusiastic for TQM believe that it is possible to obtain defect-free
work ﬁrst time on a consistent basis. That may be an idealistic target but to have such a
target encourages a culture where prevention of error is a key feature of the operations.
This activity of improving quality to improve proﬁts will itself cause cost to be
incurred. The term cost of quality is a collective name for all costs incurred in achieving
a quality product or service.
Cost of quality may be deﬁned by the ‘prevention–appraisal–failure’ model.
Prevention costs are the costs of designing, implementing and maintaining the TQM
system. They include: quality planning, quality assurance, training and determining
speciﬁcations for incoming materials, for processes carried out in the operations of the
business and for ﬁnished products.
Appraisal costs are the costs of evaluating suppliers and obtaining an evaluation by
customers. They include checking incoming materials and supplies, inspecting equipment
and collecting information from customers on satisfaction with goods and services.
Failure costs are of two main types: internal failure costs are the costs incurred when
it is found, before delivery to customers, that the work does not reach the desired
speciﬁcation; external failure costs are the costs incurred when poor-quality work is dis-
covered after the supply to the customer has taken place. Examples of internal failure
costs are: waste, scrap, rectiﬁcation, re-inspection of rectiﬁed work and analysis of the
causes of failure. External failure costs include: repairs, warranty claims, complaints,
returns, product liability litigation and loss of customer goodwill.

Chapter 25 Business strategy and management accounting
705
The traditional picture of quality control is that in the absence of quality control,
failures occur which create failure costs. Detection of failure relies on checking after
the failure has occurred. The checking process involves further checking costs. With
quality controls in place, as prevention work is undertaken, the costs of failure should
begin to fall. At the outset, the prevention costs will be additional to the costs of check-
ing for failures, but as conﬁdence grows, and the frequency of failure decreases, 
the need for checking should diminish. The quality exercise will be successful in cost
terms if there is a reduction in total cost over the three headings of prevention,
appraisal and failure costs.
TQM ideas are widely practised and there are many non-ﬁnancial performance
measures being used in business organisations. Measuring the cost of quality is a rela-
tively undeveloped area although a few businesses have a well-developed approach.
The management accountant as score-keeper is ideally placed to record and monitor
cost of quality, but many of the initiatives emerging are in special units within an
organisation which are separate from the ‘traditional’ management accounting func-
tions. Management accountants may need to be proactive in seeking out new ways of
applying their generic skills.
25.6 Business process re-engineering
Business process re-engineering involves a dramatic redesign of business processes,
organisation structures and use of technology to achieve breakthroughs in business
competitiveness. The beneﬁts claimed are that operations can be streamlined, and 
consequently costs can be cut, while creating process excellence in all key aspects of
the organisation.
The phrase ‘breaking the china’ has been used by those who describe the technique.
They are looking for a quantum leap into being a world leader. They draw the analogy
of passing a treasured set of family china from one generation to the next. One day the
entire collection falls to the ﬂoor in pieces. Putting it together again produces a 
totally different pattern in the china. In a similar way, if the whole business process is
broken up and then restructured with the aim of being a world leader, an entirely new
policy will emerge.
The advocates of business process re-engineering explain that, while concentrating
on innovations such as TQM and JIT, businesses were retaining the traditional ways
of working in functional groups. Quality teams were given the task of creating new
ways of working within their speciﬁc areas or functions. In contrast, business process
re-engineering concentrates on the process rather than the function.
Take an example of a company manufacturing engines for heavy goods vehicles.
The castings provided by the supplier did not align exactly with the machine which
carried them to the assembly line. This had always been accepted as a function of the
business operation despite the fact that it caused a pause in production at regular
intervals to allow maintenance work necessitated by wear and tear. As a re-engineering
of the business process, the supplier was asked to manufacture the castings to a different
speciﬁcation which would align with the machine. This allowed the process to speed
up by 30% on previous activity levels and quickly recovered the extra costs charged
by the supplier due to the redesign of the castings.
Take as a second example the processing of customer orders. In the traditional
approach a sales representative visited the customer and took an order. The sales 
representative initiated the order documentation, giving it an order number and setting
up a ﬁle on the computer. The product manager received the order, checked that the
resources were available for implementation and rewrote the order so that the cus-
tomer’s description of what was required could be speciﬁed in terms of the operations

Part 9 Capital investment appraisal and business strategy
706
carried out by the business. The customer’s credit rating was checked by the credit
controller. This process all took a considerable amount of time because it was not well
co-ordinated and there were gaps of time between the stages. As a re-engineering
move, the business process was shortened by giving the sales representative a portable
computer and a modem to be taken out on visits to clients. This allowed credit rating
to be checked online even while the job speciﬁcation was being discussed with the 
customer. The computer also included a data sheet on which the sales representative
could enter the customer’s order in such a way as to match the speciﬁcation required
by the production department. The information passed directly to the manufacturing
premises by way of the modem and the conﬁrmed speciﬁcation was returned by fax
to the customer. The entire operation of specifying and conﬁrming the order could 
be completed within one hour, while the sales representative was still on hand at the
customer’s premises.
The advocates of business process re-engineering emphasise three goals: customer
satisfaction, market domination and increased proﬁtability. To win the claim to be a
world leader requires success in all three. The business therefore has to identify the
core business processes which drive it and to think in terms of process enhancement.
Identifying the core business process and ‘reading the market’ helps the company to
ﬁnd a ‘break point’ where a change in the business process can cause a signiﬁcant 
positive reaction in the market and take the company into a leadership position.
For some business, re-engineering may be too drastic, especially when new products
are being introduced. Continuous quality improvement may be a more achievable 
target, where analysis of strengths and weaknesses is used to identify short-term
achievable improvements on an incremental basis.
25.7 E-business and e-commerce
This section gives a very brief summary of some aspects of e-business and shows 
how management accounting has a role to play in e-business. You can learn more about
e-business by using the ‘Further reading’ listed at the end of the chapter.
Electronic business, usually described as e-business, uses technology to automate
and to change existing business practices. It affects product development, marketing,
sales and the ways in which goods and services are delivered to customers.
Electronic commerce, usually described as e-commerce, is one part of e-business.
It relates to all transactions between the company and its customers or suppliers,
where electronic media are involved. The customer may wish to inspect a catalogue
advertising products. The supplier may wish to draw the company’s attention to
changes in prices or products. The acts of buying and selling may take place elec-
tronically. E-commerce involves aspects of sharing business information about 
products and services, together with carrying out business transactions.
The theme throughout this book has been that management accounting has a role in:
l planning
l decision making
l control.
Now we consider each aspect of the role of management accounting in e-business
and e-commerce.
25.7.1
Planning
The ﬁrst question that might be asked is: ‘Should we start an e-business venture?’ 
The entrepreneur may have a vision of a new product or a new market but for any

Chapter 25 Business strategy and management accounting
707
business the key accounting-related questions are: ‘Can we make a proﬁt?’ and ‘Will
there be adequate cash ﬂow?’
Revenue and cash inflow
There are examples of e-commerce where businesses sell existing products or services
over the Internet rather than through shops and ofﬁces or by postal mail. From the
management accounting point of view there are new challenges in ensuring that the
recording of revenue matches the delivery of goods and services. New control pro-
cedures must be devised, with particular attention to the security of electronic data and
cash transmission. The accounting records for revenue earned and cash received will
be broadly similar to those used in any business. Cash ﬂow may speed up if customers
make electronic payment ahead of delivery. Revenue may be lost if the Internet-based
system is difﬁcult to use, or is not available throughout the day.
Greater challenges arise for management accounting where new forms of revenue
are earned by a company through the nature of e-business. These may be described
generally as ‘digital services’. Examples include:
l selling banner advertising space on the company’s website;
l earning commission on sales of goods by other business that have a hyperlink from
the company’s website;
l fees charged for allowing another business to have a ‘shop-front’ on the company’s
website.
These create accounting problems where two businesses ‘swap’ advertising space.
‘I will let you advertise on my website if you will let me advertise on yours.’ No cash
changes hands but each business is gaining a beneﬁt. This is called ‘barter’, a system
of trading which starts in the school playground and extends around the world in
places where cash is not readily available. Clearly there is no cash ﬂow. Should each
business estimate ‘revenue’ earned from the sale of advertising? There are costs of creat-
ing the advertisements so it seems a reasonable idea to estimate a ﬁgure for revenue.
However, there is no transaction for the sale of advertising and it is far from clear that
the advertiser would actually pay a fee if asked. If that is the case then the estimated
value of revenue is zero. There are no easy answers on how to record the value gained
from barter transactions.
Costs and cash outflow
For the business selling products and services electronically there remain the costs 
of producing the product or service. Beyond that, the e-business approach may reduce
some costs and increase or create others. The costs that involve cash outﬂows may be
subdivided into (a) set-up costs and (b) operating costs. The role of management
accounting in planning is to estimate these costs for comparison with expected 
revenues.
Set-up costs include the costs of hardware and software, including internal networks
and external links to suppliers and customers. The set-up costs also include the costs
of managing the introduction of the project, developing and testing software, trans-
ferring data from the conventional business records to the new electronic system and
training staff in using the new technology.
Operating costs include all staff costs relating to operating the new system, plus
maintenance costs for the electronic system.
Cost savings may be set against these new operating costs. The business may be
able to reduce the costs of stafﬁng branch outlets, or having more staff time available
to deal with problematic incoming telephone enquiries because the routine enquiries
are dealt with through the website.

25.7.2
Decision making
Chapter 24 has explained various approaches to decision making related to long-term
investments. Payback, accounting rate of return, discounted cash ﬂow and internal
rate of return have been explained and the calculations illustrated. At the end of 
that chapter the problems of appraising advanced manufacturing technologies were
discussed. They require a different approach to investment appraisal and decision
making. E-business offers similar challenges to management accounting for invest-
ment appraisal.
Typical questions that might be asked in an e-business decision are:
l Should we make the proposed investment in hardware, software and staff training
for information systems to support e-commerce?
l Which of our existing business operations will give the highest return if converted
to e-commerce methods?
The difﬁcult task for the management accountant is to identify the incremental cash
ﬂows. The questions to be asked are: how much additional revenue can be generated
by this new way of working? How much additional cost will be incurred after taking
into consideration any planned cost saving? The uncertainties relating to e-business
and e-commerce are such that discounted cash ﬂow techniques may be of limited 
relevance. Payback focuses on how quickly the original outlay can be recovered
through cash ﬂows generated.
25.7.3
Control
Management accounting helps managers in their control activities through compar-
ing actual costs and revenues with budgeted estimates and through quantifying and
highlighting variances. The management accountant is also involved in systems
design and the processing controls necessary to protect the assets and the accuracy 
of accounting records. Non-ﬁnancial performance measures are a signiﬁcant element
of controlling the e-business activity.
The business receiving cash from e-commerce transactions must have adequate
security measures in place. Secure connections are necessary to set up secure links
between supplier and customer. Encryption (a coded message) is used for information
that is being transferred and for the records held at either end of the link. The customer
must be given conﬁdence in the security controls of the supplier. The supplier must be
sure that the customer has a good reputation and that the transaction will be honoured.
Data migration is one important aspect of moving to e-commerce where the 
management accountant may have a particularly useful role. Data migration means
transferring data from the existing system to the new system. Sometimes this activity
is called populating the database. Whatever it is called, the activity requires careful
control and testing to ensure that no data are lost or corrupted in the process.
Indicators of success that evaluate the relative effectiveness of an e-business activity
must include a mixture of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial measures (sometimes called 
metrics). Two questions to be asked about effectiveness might be:
1 Is the marketing effective?
2 Is the business outcome effective?
Effective marketing requires attracting the attention of the potential customer.
Visitor activity on the site can be measured by hits or by site visits. A ‘hit’ is recorded
every time a piece of information is downloaded, so one visit to the site might result
in several hits. Intending customers may be asked to register an email address or to
give information about themselves. This is all part of the marketing information that
will be analysed by the organisation to reﬂect activity.
Effective business outcomes are assessed using accounting information on revenues
and costs. The business might set a target proportion of revenues to be achieved by

Chapter 25 Business strategy and management accounting
709
Internet selling. The management accountant will report on achievement of the target.
Analysts often enquire about marketing costs because these are effectively an invest-
ment for the future. The ratio of marketing costs to revenues for Internet business
might be compared with the ratio for conventional business.
Non-ﬁnancial indicators of effective business outcomes might include customer 
satisfaction surveys, delivery response times, complaints received or frequency of
errors in delivery and invoicing.
25.7.4
Advising small businesses
Fiona has found that her work advising small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
is requiring her to develop an expertise in e-business and e-commerce.
FIONA: I read a survey recently which found that most British SMEs prefer to maintain their
own website and run their own e-business. That means they have to cover the cost of
designing the website and they pay an in-house webperson to maintain it, involving a salary
and other costs of employment. More than 80% of UK businesses have a website. Some
500,000 companies are trading online but many more companies, including most of the
1.9m SMEs, use the Internet as a shop window. Many UK companies are saying that the
Internet has transformed sales and marketing, delivery, operations and processing.
However, it seems to me as a management accountant, that cost planning and control
do not appear to rank highly in the decision to move to e-business activity. There is per-
haps too strong a focus on revenue and lack of attention to costs and cash flow. As a result
we have seen the failure of some ‘dot.com’ businesses where the cash resources have
become exhausted. Another survey that I came across found there was little emphasis on
budgets or management in the development of e-commerce strategies.
Is e-commerce suited to all SMEs? A decision to move to e-commerce must be related
to the overall business strategy and the sales strategy. The business should ask itself:
l Will e-commerce contribute to the competitive advantage of the business?
l Will it add value?
l Will the beneﬁts outweigh the costs?
Take the example of a family business which has built its reputation for selling 
specialist hand tools to tradespersons and do-it-yourself enthusiasts. It has shops in
several large towns but its reputation extends beyond those towns and customers 
will travel considerable distances to buy specialist tools. The business would be well
placed to enter into e-commerce selling because its name is well known, its reputation
is established in the retail outlets, which will continue to operate, and the Internet can
widen the market through direct customer order and delivery to the door.
Take another example of an antiquarian bookseller who buys and sells rare books.
Again the bookseller has an established reputation in trade journals and has been
using catalogue-based mail order sales for some years. The business would be well
placed to enter into e-commerce by adding a website reference to existing advertising
material. It may also improve the bookseller’s ability to ﬁnd sources of rare books well
beyond the local sources traditionally used. Furthermore, since competitors have
already established e-commerce outlets, the bookseller may lose market share if it does
not move to Internet buying and selling.
25.8 Summary
You might ask, having read this chapter, why it is necessary to pay any attention to
the previous ten chapters. The answer is that the ideas described in this chapter are

Part 9 Capital investment appraisal and business strategy
710
exciting and forward-looking but they are being used primarily by a selection of the
market leaders and the innovators. There is a vast range of businesses which are still
using traditional management accounting techniques. That will necessitate an under-
standing of the traditional approach for some time yet, in a spirit of evolution rather
than revolution. So while you should read and think about the new ideas, you will
also ﬁnd it necessary to understand and apply the aspects of management accounting
which have been taught traditionally. If you have a strong command of the approach
to management accounting set out in the chapters of this book, then you will have 
the basis on which to build an understanding of the present practice in most busi-
ness organisations. You will also be in a position to move on to an in-depth study of
developments in management accounting in both the academic and the practical
spheres.

B
Application
B25.1
The directors of Craigielaw plc have decided that specialist paints for use on buses and lorries
should become the focus of a new e-business strategy. ‘All we have at present is a call centre
where our customers phone in orders’, said the sales manager. ‘Our two main competitors are
improving their business-to-business activities by linking to Internet providers. Our strengths lie
in customer loyalty and the reputation of our product for quality.’
Explain how value chain analysis can be combined with the development of an e-business 
strategy (300 words).
B25.2
A company manufacturing specialised medical equipment and supplies is currently having a
debate internally about developing an e-business strategy. The sales manager wants to develop
an e-commerce website. The managing director thinks that electronic methods are not necessary;
what really matters is intensive marketing and offering good technical support for the products.
Explain how the management accountant could provide useful information to help this debate
come to a conclusion (300 words).
B25.3
Explain how a low-cost airline can use strategic management accounting in developing a busi-
ness strategy for competing with the traditional airlines (300 words).
C
Problem solving and evaluation
C25.1
A company is reviewing its total quality management programme, which does not appear to be
making the progress expected. Problems have been identified in:
l fear of exposing weaknesses in the organisation;
l lack of commitment from senior executives;
l seeing it as someone else’s problem.
How could the management accountant help in addressing these problems (300 words)?
C25.2
How could planning of business strategy be useful to a public sector organisation such as a
public library service? Does the idea of competition have any meaning? How can the manage-
ment accountant help in planning a business strategy for a public library service (300 words)?
Activities for study groups
Case 25.1
A company selling life insurance policies is planning to implement the balanced scorecard
approach. The board of directors is aware that it should consider four aspects of vision and goals:
l financial perspective
l customer perspective
l internal business processes
l innovation and learning.
Prepare a short introduction for a meeting of administrative staff which is intended to ask them
to suggest items for inclusion under these four headings. Make your own list of three items for
each heading so that you can help the discussion if it needs some prompting.

Case 25.2
A manufacturer of toothpaste has estimated the price at which the product will sell, making use
of market surveys and consumer analysis. A profit margin has been set. Finally a target cost 
has been established by subtracting the target cost from the estimated selling price. The plant
manager and the research and development unit have been asked to design the product in such
a way that it can be produced within the target cost.
A rival manufacturer of toothpaste takes a different approach. Here the selling price is again
estimated from market surveys and consumer analysis and a profit margin is set. However, the
product design is then accepted on the recommendation of the research and development unit
and the plant manager then focuses on a programme of continuous improvement which will
keep costs within acceptable limits.
Is there a role for management accounting in either of these situations?
Case 25.3
Search the management feature pages of a business newspaper such as the Financial 
Times for a period of one month. Find articles about management which have a management
accounting angle. Select one of the articles and write a response setting out the ways in which
management accounting will contribute to the management purposes described in the article.

in the short term.
creditors Persons or organisations that are owed
money by the entity.

converted into cash within the trading cycle.
current liability A liability that is expected to be
repaid within a short period of time, usually within
one year.

Accounting policies (extracts)
Intangible non-current (fixed) assets
Purchased goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the con-
sideration paid for an acquired entity and the aggregate of the fair values of that entity’s
identifiable assets and liabilities. An impairment review has been undertaken at the balance
sheet date.
Freehold and leasehold property
Freehold and leasehold land and buildings are stated either at cost (Security and Cleaning)
or at their revalued amounts less depreciation (Disposal and Recycling). Full revaluations
are made at five-year intervals with interim valuations in the intervening years, the most
recent full revaluation being in year 5.
Provision for depreciation of freehold land and buildings is made at the annual rate of
1% of cost or the revalued amounts. Leasehold land and buildings are amortised in equal
annual instalments over the periods of the leases subject to a minimum annual provision
of 1% of cost or the revalued amounts. When properties are sold the difference between
sales proceeds and net book value is dealt with in the income statement (profit and loss
account).
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Provision for depreciation is
made mainly in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets as
follows:
4 to 5 years
vehicles
5 to 10 years
plant, machinery and equipment
Inventories (stocks and work in progress)
Inventories (stocks and work in progress) are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value, using the first in first out principle. Cost includes all direct expenditure and related
overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition and location.
Deferred tax
The provision for deferred tax recognises a future liability arising from past transactions
and events. Tax legislation allows the company to defer settlement of the liability for 
several years.
Warranties
Some service work is carried out under warranty. The cost of claims under warranty is
charged against the profit and loss account of the year in which the claims are settled.
Deferred consideration
For acquisitions involving deferred consideration, estimated deferred payments are accrued
in the balance sheet. Interest due to vendors on deferred payments is charged to the profit
and loss account as it accrues.

Operating and financial review (extract)
The Directors’ Report explains that the requirement to prepare a business review is satisfied by the
production of the operating and financial review, extracts of which are presented here.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Group results
Group revenue from continuing operations in Year 7 increased by 21.3% to £714.6m, while continuing
profits before tax increased by 25.8% to £197.5m. Earnings per share increased by 20.9% to 
11.74 pence. These results show the benefits of our geographic diversification across the major
economies of the world. We have achieved excellent growth in the UK, together with continued good
growth in North America. Growth in Europe continued to be constrained by depressed economies,
while excellent results in Australia were held back by disappointing growth in South East Asia.
Segmental results are set out in detail in Note 16 to the financial statements.
In Disposal and Recycling, revenue improved by 13.4% and profits improved by 20.4%. Revenue
in Security and Cleaning improved by 53.2% and profits improved by 29.2%.
Organisation
We continue to be organised into four geographic regions, each headed by a regional managing
director. Group services are provided for finance, legal, research and development, corporate affairs,
business development and management development. These costs are allocated to divisions on the
basis of activity costing.
Strategy
Our ultimate objective is to achieve for our equity holders a high rate of growth in earnings and dividends
per share each year. Our strategies are to provide customers with the highest standards of service
and to maintain quality of service as we enter new fields. We also operate a prudent financial policy
of managing our businesses to generate a strong operating cash flow.
Disposal and recycling
Disposal and recycling includes all aspects of collection and safe disposal of industrial and commercial
waste products. During Year 7 all our operational landfill sites gained certification to the international

Information extracted from annual report of Safe and Sure Group plc, used throughout Financial Accounting
A13
environment management standard. Organic waste deposited in landfill sites degrades naturally and
gives off a gas rich in methane which has to be controlled for environmental reasons. However, landfill
sites can also be a cheap, clean and highly efficient source of renewable energy. Through strategic
long-term contracts we are generating 64MW of electricity each year from landfill waste to energy
schemes. New waste transfer and recycling centres in Germany and France were added to the Group’s
network during Year 7.
Security and cleaning
Security and cleaning is undertaken by renewable annual contract, predominantly for hospitals, other
healthcare premises and local government organisations. During Year 7 we acquired a security com-
pany in the UK and some smaller operations in Switzerland and Spain. Improved margins in contract
cleaning reflected continued demands for improved hygiene standards and our introduction of new
techniques to meet this need.
FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW OF THE POSITION OF 
THE BUSINESS
Profits
Operating profits, including the effect of discontinued operations, rose to £174.7m in Year 7, up from
£144.0m in Year 6. Interest income fell £0.7m to £2.3m in Year 7, as a result of the cash spent on
acquisitions towards the end of Year 6. At constant average Year 6 exchange rates, the Year 7 profit
before tax, including the effect of discontinued operations, would have been £0.6m higher at
£177.6m, an increase of 20.8% over the reported Year 6 figures.
Cash flow
The Group’s businesses are structured to utilise as little fixed and working capital as is consistent with
the profit and earnings growth objective in order to produce a high cash flow. The impact of working
capital on cash flow was held to an increase in Year 7 of £9.7m (Year 6: £10.0m).
A net cash flow of £196.7m was generated from operating activities. That was boosted by other
amounts of cash from interest received. After paying interest and tax, the Group had £143.0m 
remaining. Fixed assets required £48.0m after allowing for the proceeds of selling some of our 
vehicle fleet in the routine replacement programme. That left £95m from which £24.6m was required
to pay for acquisitions. The remaining £70.4m covered dividends of £29.5m leaving £40.9m. We
received £5m interest on investments and raised £3.1m in ordinary share capital to give a net inflow of
liquid funds in the year of £49.0m. Out of that amount, short-term deposits have increased by £14.5m,
leaving an increase in cash of £34.5m.
Foreign currency
We borrowed £35.2m of foreign currency bank borrowings to fund overseas acquisitions. The main
borrowings were £26.8m in US dollars and £8.4m in yen (to fund our Japanese associate investment).
The borrowings are mainly from banks on a short-term basis with a maturity of up to one year. We
have fixed the interest rate on $20m of the US dollar loans through to November Year 8 at an overall
cost of 4.5%.
All material foreign currency transactions are matched back into the currency of the Group com-
pany undertaking the transaction. It is not the Group’s current practice to hedge the translation 
of overseas profits or assets back into sterling, although overseas acquisitions may be financed by
foreign currency borrowings.
Capital expenditure
The major items of capital expenditure are vehicles, equipment used on customers’ premises and
office equipment, particularly computers. Disposals during the year were mainly of vehicles being
replaced on a rolling programme.
Taxation
The overall Group taxation charge comprises tax at 30% on UK profits and an average rate of 
38% on overseas profits, reflecting the underlying rates in the various countries in which the Group
operates.

Appendix I
A14
Future development and performance
Once again, in Year 7 Safe and Sure met its declared objective of increasing its pre-tax profits and
earnings per share by at least 20% per annum. The board expects a return to much better growth in
Europe and a substantially improved performance in the USA to underpin good Group growth for the
year.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The group operates through a wide range of activities across many countries. The principal risks and
uncertainties identified by the directors relate to the market conditions in which we operate and to
management’s capability to deliver the large number of change programmes and recovery strategies
currently underway across the businesses.
The principal risks we face may be summarised as: (1) a weakening of the economies in which we
operate; and (2) the number, scope, complexity and interdependencies of many initiatives – risk of
management stretch and overlapping priorities.
We outline below the principal risks we have identified and the actions we take to mitigate these
risks.
Description of risk
Operating costs
In the Disposal and Recycling Division across
France, Belgium and Germany we have
experienced rising wages and increasing
employment costs such as taxes. Such costs
are determined by the governments of those
countries and not under our own control.
State of the economy
The group is exposed to the economic
environments in more than 20 countries
across the world. Whilst the UK represents a
large proportion of the group’s businesses our
international diversification means that our
economic and geopolitical risks are spread
widely. Current unrest in two African countries
has caused us to suspend security and
cleaning contracts.
Market demand and competition
In France, Belgium and the Netherlands we
experienced competitive pricing pressure in
the Disposal and Recycling Division. This
resulted in a number of contract losses earlier
in the year and also affected the division’s
ability to win new contracts.
Regulation
The Disposal and Recycling Division is
vulnerable to increased costs due to changing
national regulations regarding hazardous
waste and safe disposal in the countries
where we operate.
Management action
Actions to mitigate these risks include passing on
price increases to customers to counter cost
inflation and pricing contracts appropriately to
remain competitive.
Divisional managers monitor economic activity in
their respective geographical areas. In relation to
areas of unrest, we take advice from the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office, having particular regard
to the safety of personnel and long-term security of
contracts.
In those circumstances where our competitors are
engaging in aggressive price discounting and
where we believe that to offer similar prices would
compromise service levels, our only mitigating
course of action is to ensure that contract losses do
not directly result from poor customer care, service
or relationships. Further mitigating actions include
improving the competitiveness of the business
through significant restructuring programmes in

Directors’ report (extract)
The Business Review, including a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the group,
is provided under the heading of Operating and Financial Review on pages nn to nn.
The directors recommend a final dividend of 3.54 pence per ordinary share to be paid to share-
holders on the register on 31 March Year 8. The proposed dividend for Year 8 of 3.02 pence per share
was paid on 31 March Year 7. There is no interim dividend in either Year 6 or Year 7.
Description of risk
Currency and interest rates
The group is exposed to market risk primarily
related to foreign exchange and interest rate
risk. The group’s objective is to reduce, where
it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations
in earnings and cash flows associated with
changes in interest rates, foreign currency
rates and the exposure of certain net
investments in foreign subsidiaries.
People
The company’s current management team is
implementing a five-year recovery plan based
on operational excellence which itself is built
around five key strategies, namely: to deliver
outstanding customer service, to develop
capability, to drive operational excellence, 
to operate at lowest cost and to generate
profitable growth. The principal risk for the
group is that management has the capacity
and capability to deliver the key strategies.
Management action
Management actively monitors these exposures
and the group enters into currency and interest 
rate swaps, forward rate agreements and forward
foreign exchange contracts to manage the volatility
relating to these.
The majority of sales and purchases are local,
limiting transaction risk. The policy is therefore to
accept the risk, except where significant
acquisitions or disposals are to be undertaken,
where the transaction may be hedged to give
certainty of pricing.
Within each of the five key strategies there are a
large number of improvement initiatives which
individually are managed through a proper risk
control process. The Nominations Committee
scrutinises all appointments to senior management
posts, The Remuneration Committee sets strict
targets for performance rewards.

This requires a narrative answer based on sections 4.5.1, 4.5.3 and 4.5.5.
B4.2
This requires a narrative answer based on section 4.3. The more difficult aspect of this question is
explaining how each convention affects current accounting practice. One example of each would be:
l Going concern: In historical cost accounting the fixed assets of an enterprise are recorded in the
statement of financial position (balance sheet) at the historical cost, after deducting depreciation,
rather than at estimated selling price, because the enterprise is a going concern and it is expected
that the fixed assets will be held for long-term use.

l Accruals: The expense of electricity consumed during a period includes all units of electricity used,
irrespective of whether an invoice has been paid.
l Consistency: It would be inconsistent, in a statement of financial position (balance sheet), to 
measure inventory (trading stock) at selling price at one point of time and at cost at another 
point of time.
l Prudence: It is prudent to measure inventory (stock of goods) at cost, rather than at selling price,
because to value at selling price would anticipate a sale which may not take place.

(a) Profit is only reported when there is a sale. The number of items sold is 60. Each one gives a profit
of £5 so the total profit is £300.
(b) When the 200 items are purchased there is an increase of £4,000 in the asset of inventory (stock)
of spare parts and a decrease of £4,000 in the asset of cash. When the 60 items are sold for £1,500
there is an increase in the asset of cash and an increase in the ownership interest reported as 
revenue. The 60 items cost £1,200 to purchase and so at the date of sale there is a reduction in
the asset of inventory (stock) amounting to £1,200 and a decrease in the ownership interest due
to the expense of cost of goods sold £1,200.

Application
B7.1 to B7.4
The questions at the end of Chapter 7 provide opportunities for writing about accounting information.
An outline for an answer could be developed from the chapter and it could be illustrated by using
annual reports obtained from companies or their websites.
To write a short essay for question B7.1 or question B7.3 the IASB Conceptual Framework would
be very helpful.
Question C7.1 requires you to show that you have thought about all the material in the first seven
chapters of the book. A reader of your essay might expect to find some or all of the following ques-
tions addressed:
(a) This is a listed company and so shares are bought and sold through the stock market. Does your
answer show that you have thought about this active market process?
(b) In giving advice on principles have you made use of the IASB Conceptual Framework?
(c) Have you given examples of the kind of information which would be relevant to the Conceptual
Framework? Furthermore, have you carried out some research on company annual reports so that
you can provide first-hand examples or illustrations?

(a) The amount of £8,000 has been reported as an asset. Since this is a repair it must be removed
from the assets. Removing an asset causes a decrease in the ownership interest through an ad-

(c) There is apparently a gain on disposal because the cash collected is greater than the net book
value of the asset. In reality, all that has happened is that the estimate of depreciation over the
asset life is, with the benefit of hindsight, a marginally incorrect estimate. Perfect foresight at the
outset would have used £3,000 as a residual value, rather than £2,000, in calculating the annual
depreciation charge. However, it is known that accounting involves estimates so it would be inap-
propriate in most cases to attempt to rewrite the income statements (profit and loss accounts) of
the past. Accordingly all of the ‘gain’ is reported in Year 4, as a deduction from annual depreciation.

(a) Straight-line depreciation
Machine cost £16,000, estimated residual value £1,000, so depreciate the difference, £15,000,
over five-year life to give annual depreciation of £3,000.

(The residual value at the end of Year 5 should ideally be £1,000, so a first estimate which arrives
at £1,244 is quite reasonable.)

Appendix II

(c) The net book value at the end of Year 5 is £1,000 and therefore disposal at £2,500 gives an appar-
ent gain of £1,500 which is best described as caused by over-depreciation of earlier years. The
effect on the accounting equation is that the asset of machine decreases by £1,000 while the asset
of cash increases by £2,500 so that overall the ownership interest increases by £1,500.
(d) The net book value at the end of Year 5 is £1,000 and therefore disposal at nil scrap value gives
an apparent loss of £1,000 which is best described as caused by underdepreciation of earlier
years. The effect on the accounting equation is that the asset of machine decreases by £1,000 with
no increase in any other asset so that overall the ownership interest decreases by £1,000.

First the original incorrect entry must be reversed. When the entry was made, it was treated as an
increase in the ownership interest and an increase in the asset of debtor. This error must be reversed
by decreasing the ownership interest and decreasing the asset of debtor.
Then the correct entry must be made which is a decrease in the ownership interest and an increase
in a liability to the landlord.

statement (profit and loss account). The accounting equation remains in balance because there is a
matching liability of £8,000 recorded. However, the liability is split as £6,000 current liability and
£2,000 deferred liability to reflect different patterns of payment of the overall liability.

If the directors decide that they wish to incorporate the revaluation in the statement of financial 
position (balance sheet), then the asset will be reported at £380,000. The difference between the 
previous recorded book value £250,000 and the new value £380,000 is £130,000. This is an increase
in the ownership interest and will be reported as a revaluation reserve as part of the total ownership
interest.
B12.5
In this case the value has decreased by £10,000. This is a reduction in the value of the asset and a
decrease in the ownership claim. On grounds of prudence the loss should be reported in the income
statement (profit and loss account) immediately and the recorded book value of the asset should be
reduced.

Commentary. The company has exceeded its annual earnings growth target of 20% in each year for
which calculations can be made. The dividend cover is relatively high, indicating a policy of retaining
new wealth to finance expansion. In Year 6 the dividend cover increased because the dividend growth
decreased. In Year 7 the cover remains higher and the dividend growth improved. With the expansion
the company has maintained its rate of return on shareholders’ equity. The company is likely to be
attractive to investors if future prospects are similar to the historical trend.

(d) All total costs follow a straight line. Total fixed costs do not depend on mileage. Total variable
costs increase directly with mileage. Total fixed plus variable costs start at £6,500 for zero miles
and increase in direct proportion to mileage. The average cost per mile for each year falls as the
annual mileage increases. Note that for tyres a proportionate cost has been calculated where the
mileage is not exactly 15,000 miles. Note also that depreciation has been included as a fixed cost
because it does not depend on mileage covered.

The costs incurred during May relate to 4,000 towel rails, so allocate costs on this basis. Product
costs are £22,400 in total, or £5.60 per towel rail. There are 500 towel rails remaining in stock at the
end of the month which would have a value of £(500 × 5.60) = £2,800.
Most business would use a value higher than £5.60 to take some of the period costs into account
(e.g. a proportion of the production manager’s salary). However, this is a matter of judgement where
others would charge all period costs in the profit and loss account.

(a) The use of a machine hour rate is appropriate for Department 1, which is heavily dependent on
machine hours, but not for Department 2, which is more dependent on labour hours. The produc-
tion overhead should be allocated according to the factor which most closely causes it to be
incurred. In Department 1 this is likely to be machine hours but in Department 2 it is more likely to
be labour hours.
(b) Applying a rate of £5.60 to 48,000 machine hours, the overhead absorbed was £268,800. This 
was less than the amount of overhead incurred, £275,000, and so it is said that overheads are
underabsorbed by £6,200. The use of estimated overhead absorption rates, based on budget, is
necessary for an estimation of cost before the true costs are known. However, the full actual costs
have to be accounted for at the end of the period and so a further £6,200 must be charged to the
profit and loss account in addition to the costs charged as jobs proceeded.

Explanation. The 880-package option is the preferred one because it gives the benefit of a higher 
volume of profit without increasing the fixed costs. The 1,350-package option takes up more fixed
costs and so reduces unit profit.

(b) Dishwashers should not be dropped, because they make a contribution to fixed cost and profit. 
If production ceased the contribution of £60,000 would be lost but the fixed overheads would 
continue at £110,000. Overall the profit would reduce to £50,000. It may be that in the longer term
an element of fixed cost can be identified as related to dishwashers alone. If this element were to
exceed £60,000 it might be reasonable to discontinue production of dishwashers and discontinue
the fixed cost.
B20.5 Capital Tours Ltd
(a) Total costs are £180,000 of which £60,000 are fixed costs. Variable cost is therefore £120,000 over
1,000 tours, or £120 per tour.
Selling price = £200 per person, contribution = £80 per person.
At new offer price of £140 per tour, contribution = £20 per person and so is acceptable in the 
short term.
(b) The offer is acceptable provided it does not displace any tours for which £200 would be paid. Also
there must be no risk of offending existing customers who have already paid £200. If the new lower
price became common knowledge, the price might be driven down so that the break-even point
would increase and more tours would have to be sold to achieve the same total profit.

Net benefit

Reducing production of cream cartons by 20% per annum will lose £120,000 × 50 × 20%, i.e.
£1,200,000.
Reducing production of packet cheese by 25% per annum will lose £84,000 × 50 × 25%, i.e.
£1,050,000.
The net benefit of the new product is therefore greater than the loss on either of the options 
withdrawn.
The recommendation is to reduce packet cheese and replace with aerosol cream cheese. The only
possible warning here is that there is only £150,000 of difference between withdrawing cream cartons
and withdrawing packet cheese. If the growing customer dissatisfaction with cream in cartons is 
serious, the longer-term view might prevail over the short-term recommendation.

Cost of indirect materials in March £500, split £200 variable and £300 fixed.
During April direct labour hours will be 20% higher and it is known that variable indirect material is
proportionate to direct labour hours, so increase variable cost by 20% from £200 to £240. Fixed cost
remains constant so total budget is £540.

B21.1 Garden Ornament Company
From the information presented in Tables T 1 to T 5 the various detailed budgets are prepared as
shown in Tables T 6 to T 18. These lead to the master budget set out in Tables T 19 to T 21.
Sales budget: sales and debtors
The sales budget sets out the volume of sales expected for each product, multiplied by the expected
selling price, to obtain the total sales by value expected for each product. The total sales for the year
ahead may then be calculated, shown in bold print in the sales budget.

Direct materials budget: purchases, stock and trade creditors
Once the production plan is decided, the costs of the various inputs to production may be calculated.
Direct materials must be purchased to satisfy the production plans, but the purchases budget must
also take into account the need to hold stock of raw materials. After the purchases budget has been
quantified in terms of cost, the impact on trade creditors may also be established.

Solutions to numerical and technical questions in Management Accounting
A51
The purchases budget is based on the units required for production in the period, making
allowance for the opening and closing stock of raw materials. The plan is to hold sufficient stock 
at the end of the period to meet 60% of the following month’s production (see T 3). The number of
units to be purchased will equal the planned production for the period, plus the planned stock of raw
materials at the end of the period (shown in the opening balance sheet at T 5), minus the planned
stock of raw materials at the end of the period (calculated in T 8).

The direct materials cost of goods sold must also be calculated at this point, for use in the budgeted
profit and loss account. The direct materials cost of goods sold is based on the materials used in 
production of the period (which in this example is all sold during the period).

labour cost per unit to give a labour cost for each separate item of product and a total for the year,
shown in bold print.

It is also useful to check on the total resource requirement which corresponds to this total labour cost,
since it takes time to plan increases or decreases in labour resources. The average direct labour cost
was given in (T 1) as £15,000 per person per year. The following calculation assumes that the em-
ployees can work equally efficiently on any of the three product lines.
(T 14)
Resource requirement:
Based on an average cost of £15,000 per person per year, the total labour cost of £291,000 would
require 19.4 full-time equivalent persons.
Production overhead budget
Production overheads include all those overhead items which relate to the production activity. In this
example it includes heat and light, business rates and depreciation. Depreciation is calculated at a
rate of 20% on the total cost of equipment held during the year (£190,000 at the start, as shown in 
(T 5), plus an additional £70,000 noted in (T 4) (£260,000 × 20% = £52,000).

going separate budgets. Where the derivation of figures in the master budget should be evident from
the earlier budgets, no explanation is given, but where further calculations have been performed these
are shown as working notes.

Budgeted cash flow statement
Where expenses are paid for as soon as they are incurred, the cash outflow equals the expense 
as shown in the budgeted profit and loss account. In the case of cash collected from customers,
debtors at the start and end of the period must be taken into the calculation. In the case of cash 
paid to suppliers the creditors at the start and end of the period must be taken into account. The cash
flow statement contains references to working notes which follow the statement and set out the 
necessary detail.

Comment on cash flow statement
This is the type of statement which would be required by someone being asked to lend money to the
business. The start-up situation requires cash but there is a positive cash flow from operations. The
lender would want to add to the cash flow statement a schedule of loan repayments and interest 
payments to see whether the operational cash flows could meet the financing needs of the business.

Payment for overheads – production overhead budget
Total production overhead comprises variable and fixed overhead. The variable overhead is calcu-
lated using the variable overhead cost per unit multiplied by the number of units produced. The fixed
overhead is fixed for each year and is not affected by volume of activity in the period.

The question asks only for the results at 31 March and the revised budget thereafter but the infor-
mation may be used to reply to the question asked by the directors in relation to the cash flow impact.
You may find this more difficult but it is something which you can at least think out in general terms.
First of all the measures taken to restore the gross profit must have an impact. Then the directors are
controlling the level of stock so that it is not using up resources in the form of cash. Reducing the
period of credit given to trade debtors will improve cash flow (basing the calculation on the lower level
of actual sales achieved and expected). Finally the cost of goods sold has been controlled better in
the second half. This will reduce the amount owing to creditors, even though the period of credit
remains unchanged.

20,000 blocks require 100,000 kg of material so standard usage is 5 kg per block.
16,000 blocks should use 80,000 kg but actual usage is 80,080 kg. Adverse usage variance is 80 kg
at standard cost of £3 per kg, i.e. adverse variance £240.

Total variance is £6,000 adverse less £2,500 favourable = £3,500 adverse. So actual costs were

One possible interpretation of the variance analysis is that less wastage of material occurred
through buying higher-quality material at a higher unit price. Labour was paid more than expected,
which may have been due to an unexpected pay award, but nevertheless worked less efficiently than
expected. The inefficient working has a consequence also on the efficiency of using variable over-
heads although this was more than offset by a lower than expected rate of variable overhead cost.

Fixed overhead variance is an expenditure variance reflecting less spent than expected.
One possible explanation here is that the company tried to save money by buying cheaper ma-
terial but this had the wrong effect because it increased wastage and hence usage was greater. The
rate variance indicates that the incentive payment was successful: it had a cost which was more than
offset by greater efficiency.

Comment. Direct materials needs investigating for controllability of the usage variance and whether
low-price goods have been purchased with a consequence of more wastage. Direct labour is the 
variance of most concern because of its magnitude. If the labour rate has changed then the budget
should be revised so that the non-controllable variance of £15,200 is not reported. The inefficiency 
of labour working is matched by inefficiency in use of variable overhead and the cause of the 
unexpected extra hours should be investigated.

= £5,600 adverse variance
= £6,400 adverse variance
Fixed overhead expenditure variance is £3,000 adverse, indicating the budget was £36,000.
One possible interpretation is that cheaper material was bought but resulted in more wastage, the
adverse effect on usage exceeding the price saving. The labour rate increased, possibly due to an
agreed wage rise, but the efficiency worsened, perhaps because of the cheaper material. The adverse
fixed overhead expenditure indicates overspending which is not related to volume effects.

Comment. More expensive material may have produced better quality and caused some offsetting in
less material wastage. However, efficiency of working was lower than expected, affecting both labour
and variable overhead costs. The variable overhead rate was lower than expected, suggesting some
saving on the cost of overheads, but the labour rate was higher than expected, suggesting an 
unexpected pay award.

Comment. The comparison between budget and actual must be made on the basis of a flexible 
budget which allows for the revised levels of production and sales. In both cases the activity has 
been greater than was expected when the budget was set. Making comparison with a flexible budget
shows that heavy paving made a contribution which was £2,000 less than expected while garden
paving made a contribution which was £47,000 greater than expected.

Questions to ask
1
Has there been a change in the sales price of these items? If so the budget should be revised to
take account of the new price, and the variance for the period would be £8,000 adverse.
2
Has there been a change in the cost of direct materials? If so the budget should be revised to avoid
giving the impression of an adverse variance of £8,000. The usefulness of variance analysis lies in
identifying controllable variances, not in relating to outdated budgets.
3
On the presumption that there has been no change in the labour rate, is the supervisory team
working effectively? One explanation of the adverse cost variance could be inefficient working in
the production department.

Comment. The original sales level expected was 130 units. Additional profit has been created by 
selling 150 units but beyond that there is a favourable variance of £12,990. This is primarily due to the
cost of purchased machine tools being less than expected (£482 rather than £600 each). The direct
labour variance was adverse but we are not provided with sufficient information to break this down
into rate and efficiency variances. A similar limitation on analysis applies to the favourable variance
on variable production overhead. The fixed production overhead shows a marginal saving on budget.
Chapter 23
C23.1 Furniture Manufacture Ltd
A control report should emphasise the costs which are controllable within the organisation and which
are most closely the responsibility of the manager concerned.
Although the power failure was beyond the control of the departmental manager, the company
needs to know the cost of that failure. If there was a power failure then there can have been no prod-
uctive work from direct labour and it is likely that indirect labour, indirect materials and indirect 
production overhead would not have been incurred during that time. The fixed overheads will have
been incurred irrespective but the variable maintenance costs may not have been incurred where
there was no activity to maintain. So the budgeted cost should be recalculated at 75% of the expected
cost and compared with actual. This may give a better comparison with the actual cost.

The revised table suggests that the bench assembly department manager should not be quite so
complacent as was indicated from the earlier table. The labour costs appear to be higher than would
be expected for a power failure period, unless the explanation is that they have been paid overtime
rates to catch up on the work. Questions also need to be asked about the maintenance labour. It may
be that the explanation is that additional maintenance was undertaken during the enforced idleness,
although this explanation depends on being able to undertake maintenance without an electricity supply.

The payback of £50,000 occurs one-fifth of the way into Year 4, i.e. payback is 3.2 years.
Accounting rate of return
Total profit over 5 years is £95,000 less depreciation of £40,000, i.e. £55,000.
Average profit is therefore £11,000 per annum.
Accounting rate of return is 11,000/50,000 = 22%.
Net present value
(Using assumed discount rate of 10%.)
Using the formula approach the net present value is calculated as:

+
+
−50,000
= 9,090 + 12,397 + 15,026 + 17,075 + 21,732 −50,000
= 75,320 −50,000
= 25,320

all cases the answers are close so that other non-financial factors may also need to be considered.

All the projects are acceptable because they all have a positive net present value but the maximis-
ation of net present value from an investment of £1m requires selection of the projects which give the
highest net present value per £ of investment. This is most conveniently estimated by comparing the
total present value with the outlay (sometimes referred to as the profitability index). The order of pref-
erence is therefore:
Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Alpha.
The highest net present value within a £1m limit would be £309,000 obtained from Bravo, Charlie and
Delta. If the additional funding can be borrowed then Alpha is also desirable.

Total present value = 1,447,000.
Investment required is £1,150,000 and there is ‘lost’ scrap value of £30,000, giving a total outlay of
£1,180,000.
So compare present value of £1,447,000 with outlay of £1,180,000. Net present value is positive
therefore investment is acceptable.
Other matters – is demand sustainable, are production costs controllable at lower level, is scrap
value forecast realistic?
