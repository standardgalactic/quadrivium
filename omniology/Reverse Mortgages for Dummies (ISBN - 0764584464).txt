About the Author
Sarah Glendon Lyons is a San Diego-based writer with a diverse
portfolio of housing-industry experience. She holds a B.A. in English
Language and Literature from the University of Arizona, and studied
at Australia’s University of Wollongong before joining Hanley Wood
LLC, publishers of over 75 consumer home magazines. As an editor
for Pfingsten Publishing’s Mortgage Originator magazine, she has
written hundreds of articles for mortgage professionals. Although
she has developed a wide scope of lending insight, her particular
expertise is in the reverse mortgage field. Sarah has been inter-
viewed on the topic of reverse mortgages by leading mortgage
executives and sales trainers, and offers reverse mortgage informa-
tion to originators and consumers around the country. Her perspec-
tive as an unbiased researcher and consultant allows her to provide
readers with both the benefits and challenges of reverse mortgages.
John E. Lucas has been in the mortgage banking industry for over
39 years, actively originating mortgage loans in the Van Nuys, Ca.
area. When the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) introduced the HECM reverse mortgage in 1989, he worked
with one of the companies HUD chose to participate in the test pro-
gram. His involvement in this process led him to concentrate his
career on reverse mortgages, rather than the typical  “forward”
mortgage. John has lectured on the subject of reverse mortgages to
a wide variety of organizations and groups such as senior centers,
realtors, CPAs, financial planners, elder law attorneys, service clubs
and university groups, and is a member of the National Reverse
Mortgage Lenders Association.
John will tell anyone he comes in contact with about reverse mort-
gages, and admits he has a “passion” for the program. He feels
strongly about expanding the public’s awareness of reverse mort-
gages, because he has seen how a reverse mortgage can change a
senior’s quality of life. As a senior himself, he understands the
needs of seniors and is committed to continue originating reverse
mortgages for the foreseeable future.


Dedication
We would like to dedicate this book to all those who have taken an
active role in their future finances, whether through a reverse
mortgage or by other means. To all those baby boomers who are
planning early, to all those adult children who have set aside the
time to help their parents with this essential decision, and of
course, to all of our senior readers who chose to be in control of
their own financial destiny. We wish you the best of luck! 
Author’s Acknowledgments
We would like to thank everyone who made this book possible, all
those who supported our efforts, and our friends and family who
sat patiently by as we toiled away through weekends and holidays.
Thank you to our acquisitions editor Mikal Belicove for your per-
sonal, kind attention to this project. Thank you Jennifer Connolly
for all of your hard work editing this manuscript and for being such
a great source of ideas. Thank you Peter Bell for acting as Technical
Editor and offering your and the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders
Association’s support.  Thank you Carole Sparrow, reverse mort-
gage counselor, and Mary Beth Johnson, appraiser, for your time
and efforts providing information and proofing the chapters you
inspired.
Sarah Glendon Lyons: I would especially like to thank Pfingsten
Publishing and Mortgage Originator magazine for the constant
encouragement and interest in this project. Thank you David
Branfman for your legal council and generosity. John Obradovich,
thank you for recommending me as the reverse mortgage expert.
Thank you to my co-author, John Lucas, for your dedication and
commitment to this book. I’m particularly grateful to my parents,
family, and friends who consistently asked about “the book” and
learned more than they ever wanted to know about reverse mort-
gages, all with a smile. To Adam, thank you for waiting patiently
while I worked, and always offering to read over these pages. To
everyone who helped make this book a possibility, my sincere
thanks.
John E. Lucas: I want to thank Sarah Lyons for the opportunity to
participate in the writing of this book. I believe the reverse mort-
gage is a very important program that helps alleviate difficult finan-
cial problems for seniors. In most cases, the reverse mortgage will
change the quality of a senior’s life, sometimes rather dramatically.
Working with seniors and helping them to obtain reverse mortgages
has been the most satisfying portion of my professional career.
Playing a role in the writing of this book has been a privilege.

Introduction
W
elcome to Reverse Mortgages For Dummies! You’ve just done
yourself a huge favor. By picking up this book, you’re that
much closer to finding out if a reverse mortgage is right for you and
to discovering how to go about securing this rapidly growing loan
option for yourself. You may have heard about reverse mortgages
before, and you probably have some reservations about them —
it’s okay, it’s good to be skeptical about any financial matter that
you’re not entirely comfortable with. Don’t worry, you won’t hurt
our feelings if you’re reading this with one hesitant eyebrow raised.
Our job is to put your mind at ease and give you the tools you need
to make a fully informed decision about reverse mortgages. 
Reverse mortgages aren’t for everyone, and this book is in no way
an advertisement for the loan. We’re not here to sell you on reverse
mortgages; in fact, we’ve included an entire chapter on determin-
ing whether or not this loan is right for you (see Chapter 2). What
we do want to accomplish by writing this book is to open your
mind to the idea of reverse mortgages and squelch some of the
old-fashioned myths that some people have about the loan. It’s like
you probably said to your kids — we just want what’s best for you.
If the answer to your financial situation is a reverse mortgage,
great! If not, pass this on to a friend or family member who may
benefit from a reverse mortgage.
About This Book
We wrote Reverse Mortgages For Dummies to make this loan acces-
sible to all seniors and anyone who may benefit from the loan
sometime in the future. We wanted to give you all the methods and
resources you need to get a reverse mortgage, feel confident in
your decision, and fully enjoy the benefits of the loan. Because we
want you to be well-prepared and have the best reverse mortgage
resources at your fingertips, this book covers a wide range of
topics. Inside, you can find information on the pre-loan process
(what you need to do before you even apply), how to select a
reverse mortgage originator, what to expect during the loan
process, what happens afterward, and ways you and your family
can find additional help. We’ve also included sections just for adult
children, who may be helping their senior parents make this impor-
tant financial decision.

Conventions Used in This Book
In the mortgage community, the term lender may apply to the
person whose office you sit in, filling out forms; it may mean the
company that actually shells out the money; or it may mean the
even bigger company that funds a smaller company’s loans. Within
these pages, we use lender to mean the companies who fund your
loan. The person you come in contact with, who takes your appli-
cation and walks you through the loan process, is the originator.
Any lending limits mentioned in this book are as of the time of pub-
lication and are subject to change. Reverse mortgage providers like
HUD and Fannie Mae usually raise their limits every year or so — if
you’re reading this book after 2005, check with your originator or
counselor to find out what the current limits are.
All examples of calculations, loan scenarios, and estimated loan
values are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be used as
concrete proof of what you personally will experience. All loans are
based on individuals and, like snowflakes and fingerprints, no two
loans are exactly alike.
Foolish Assumptions
You don’t need to be a financial wizard to get the most out of this
book. In fact, you don’t need to know much about mortgages at all!
As we wrote this book, we did make a few assumptions about you:
 We assume you currently own a home and are somewhat
familiar with the basics of mortgages. We do not, however,
expect you to be an expert. You may not even remember what
was involved your last mortgage process, and that’s okay.
 We assume you are currently thinking about getting a reverse
mortgage, or are a loved one of someone who could benefit
from this loan. You may know a little about reverse mort-
gages, but probably aren’t aware of all your options.
 We assume you want to get the facts about reverse mortgages
before you seek out an originator.
 We assume you have already thought about what you want to
do with your reverse mortgage money, whether it’s to remodel
your kitchen, pay for medical expenses, or take a trip to Spain.

 We assume you’re no dummy. You may not be the expert on
reverse mortgages (yet), but you’re a smart, capable person
who’s ready to see how you can help yourself live more com-
fortably in your retirement.
How This Book Is Organized
Reverse Mortgages For Dummies is organized in five parts, all of
which are designed to be read in any order. You can start at
Chapter 1 and read this book cover to cover (if nothing else you’ll
get your money’s worth!), or pick and choose the chapters that
interest you most. Perhaps you already know everything you need
about reverse mortgages but don’t know how to go about setting
your financial gears in motion: just turn to Part III! Want to give 
this book to an adult child who needs some help? Flip to Part IV.
There’s no right or wrong way to read this book. Below we give you
a rundown of the five parts and what each one encompasses — 
go ahead and skip around when you see a part that has the infor-
mation you need.
Part I: Understanding the Basics 
of a Reverse Mortgage
You may have misconceptions about reverse mortgages based on
what you’ve heard in the past. Or, you may be so new to the idea
that you don’t have any preconceived notions at all. This part clears

to explain the rudiments of reverse mortgages to anyone like a pro.
Understanding Reverse Mortgages
People tend to shy away from the very idea of reverse mortgages,
in part because of their former bad rap, and in part because of all
the scary terminology. If you’re one of millions of people who are
unfamiliar with real estate terms, when someone starts spouting
off about how you can “utilize the equity in your home on deferred
payments with a conversion mortgage,” chances are pretty good
you’re going to tune it out. In fact, that’s why we wrote this book:
to give seniors and their families facts and tips about reverse mort-
gages in language that’s as approachable as a big-eyed puppy (unless
you’re a cat person, then just think of it as a little fluffy kitten). We
want you to fully understand the benefits and disadvantages of 

getting a reverse mortgage. We want you to walk into that loan
originator’s office knowing exactly what you want. And most
importantly, we want you to feel good about whatever decision you
make for your financial future.
Checking out how it works
Reverse mortgages pay you to continue living in your home. You
can think of your home as the Bank of You: You’re borrowing
money that you would have earned had you sold your house. You
can then use the money for whatever you want. Anything your
heart desires (and your wallet can handle) is yours for the taking,
whether it’s a vacation in Switzerland, moving your master bed-
room to the first floor, or sending yourself to college!
The concept is kind of abstract if you’ve been paying a lender for
the past 30 years or so, and it may be difficult to grasp at first.
Take a look at the quick reference points below. Once you get the
gist of it, you can educate your friends and family about reverse
mortgages. Next time you’re at a cocktail party, holiday dinner,
social lunch, or any time reverse mortgages come up in conversa-
tion, you can dazzle everyone with your knowledge.
Here’s a quick rundown:
 You’re a homeowner who owes little or nothing on your home.
You decide you need more money to live the lifestyle you
want, but your biggest asset is your home and you certainly
don’t want to sell it to get the money you need.
 A reverse mortgage lender figures out how much it can lend
you based on your home value, your age, and interest rates,
and loans you some percentage of the money you would have
gotten if you’d decided to sell your home.
 You still own your home and continue to live in it, but now
you’re getting payments from the lender, so your cash flow
problem is solved.
 You pay the loan back (with interest) only when you don’t live
in the house full time anymore, usually due to moving out or
death.
 You never owe more than your home is worth, no matter how
much you’ve accumulated in debt.
 You keep any leftover equity after the sale of the house; if you
owe the lender $67,000 and your home sells for $200,000, you
put the difference in your pocket and walk away smiling.
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
10

A reverse mortgage is sometimes called a deferred payment loan,
and for a very good reason. Instead of paying off the home loan as
you borrow money, the payments are put off (deferred). This is
why reverse mortgages can be such a good choice for seniors;
when you’re on a fixed income or living off of your savings, it can
help to have some extra cash in hand to supplement. Because pay-
ment is deferred, you are spending the equity in your home, rather
than earning it (as you would with a traditional forward mortgage).
Since equity is an intangible value, you never feel the effects of the
equity going down, but you sure feel the money flowing steadily
into your checking account!
Being over the hill pays off
There is a lot of ageism in society today, especially from employers
retailers. Even Hollywood starlets have a hard time finding work at
a certain age. After a while you may start to think that the only
advantage to old age is the 10-percent-off discount on Tuesdays at
the local Bar & Grille. But reverse mortgages operate for seniors
and seniors only — whippersnappers need not apply. If you are a
homeowner age 62 or older, you will probably qualify for a reverse
mortgage. There are no credit checks, and no income requirements. 
Even better, the older you are, the more money you can usually get
from your reverse mortgage. That’s because the reverse mortgage
lenders (big companies like the department of Housing and Urban
Development, Fannie Mae, and Financial Freedom) are playing the
odds. If you’re 86, chances are good that they won’t have to serv-
ice your loan for very long — you may need to move to assisted
living or pass away within only a few years, thus ending the loan. A
62-year-old, by contrast, probably has about 20 good years before
the lender even needs to think about ending the loan. When has
your age ever worked to your advantage like this?
Getting rid of common 
misconceptions
Seniors often tell us that they were considering a reverse mortgage
until a friend or relative said something like, “Reverse mortgage?!
Don’t you dare! They’ll take your house! Stay away!” We’d like to
say that these fears are completely unfounded; unfortunately, they
stem from a very old version of reverse mortgages (which are no
longer done) that, in hindsight, weren’t such a hot idea. Today’s
reverse mortgages are safe, effective, and definitely in the best
interest of the borrower. It’s a whole new generation of loans.
Chapter 1: Figuring Out the Reverse Mortgage Basics 11

Although they were revamped and vastly improved in the past 20
or so years, people still tend to think of them as a poor choice for
seniors. We’re here to fix that. Take a look at the misconceptions
below, and the truths that follow:
 The lender gets your house. This is by far the most widely
misunderstood fallacies about reverse mortgages. In fact, you
keep ownership of your home. The lender has no rights to
your home and can’t foreclose on you as long as you keep up
with your taxes and insurance. Part of the confusion about
this area stems from the fact that many reverse mortgage bor-
rowers choose to sell their homes to pay off the loan when
they move. And it makes perfect sense — what do you need
with that house if you’re not living there? But remember,
you’re selling to another regular buyer, not the lender.
 You’ll have no estate left. This one is sort of up to you. If you
own anything when you die, you’ll have an estate left. If you
spent all your money on pinball machines and then donated
everything else to charity, you won’t. Many seniors are con-
cerned that a reverse mortgage keeps them from leaving any-
thing to their children. The fact is, the way you pay off your
loan is up to you and your heirs. Chapters 7 and 13 go into
detail about this and show you several options for fulfilling
your repayment obligations. It’s also up to you to decide who
you want to leave your estate to. Unless you form an emo-
tional bond with your lender and leave your estate to them,
your family or whomever you name in your will is the inheri-
tor of your estate. Of course, they need to pay back the loan,
but it’s up to them how they carry out that responsibility.
 You won’t qualify because of poor credit. If you have bad
credit, or even moderate credit, you may have been turned
down for a loan in the past. It’s embarrassing, frustrating, and
inconvenient. Reverse mortgages work differently: You can
never be denied a loan because of bad credit — it’s not even a
consideration in your approval. The originator or lender runs
a credit report, but it’s only to make sure you don’t owe the
government any money (usually in back taxes). If you do, you
have to use a portion of your reverse mortgage money to pay
back those debts before you can start spending on yourself.
 You have to be debt free. While you are required to own a
home in order to get a reverse mortgage, you do not have to
own it “free and clear.” One of the benefits of a reverse mort-
gage is that it can help pay off your remaining forward mort-
gage, leaving you without house payments for what may be
the first time in your adult life. Here’s how it works: The
lender determines how much it can let you borrow and then
deducts the amount you still owe from your available funds.
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
12

That money pays off the first loan, and then you’re free to do
what you wish with the rest of the money.
 Only desperate people get reverse mortgages. At one time,
this may have been true. However, today’s reverse mortgage
borrower is more likely to get a loan out of want, rather than
need. In fact, a growing number of people who have no imme-
diate need are taking out these loans because they like the
security of having a financial cushion, or are planning for
future expenses. Take a look around and ask yourself if you
could use several thousand dollars. Who doesn’t? Don’t let an
antiquated stigma keep you from getting the money you want
or need.
Knowing what it isn’t
A reverse mortgage can be a lot of things: a way to make ends
meet, a nice chunk of change for a rainy day, a fabulous dream
vacation, or a remodeled kitchen. But there’s one thing it’s defi-
nitely not — free money. There’s no free lunch here. While reverse
mortgages offer many wonderful benefits, your loan will need to be
paid back, just like any other loan (whether it’s due when you
move or upon your death). 
There are fees involved that are explained in more detail in Part II,
but they can include payments to the originator, the appraiser,
postage fees, flood certificate fees, recording fees . . . the list goes
on and on. Of course, these are the same sort of fees you paid for
the mortgage that bought you the home you live in now. You also
have to pay interest on your loan, which is generally right around
the interest rates on traditional mortgages. You only pay interest
on what you borrow, so any money that you don’t use from your
pool of reverse mortgage funds isn’t charged. People still get the
idea, however, that lenders simply hand you checks every month
out of the goodness of their hearts. Now, they’re not bad people,
but they certainly aren’t looking to give away billions of dollars per
year in reverse mortgages.
Because it’s not a cheap loan, a reverse mortgage is also not the
best way to pay off a small debt. Would you really want to spend
several thousand dollars in fees and closing costs just to pay back
a $900 credit card debt? You know that wouldn’t make sense. But
what if you owed the IRS $12,000 in back taxes? In most cases, a
reverse mortgage is still too costly for this kind of debt. Okay,
that’s easy for us to say, and if it looks like the best option then by
all means take the first step and call a reverse mortgage counselor
(see Chapter 8 for more). If you’re in a similar situation, you may
also contact a financial planner who specializes in seniors’ money.
Chapter 1: Figuring Out the Reverse Mortgage Basics 13

In fact, you can probably ask a reverse mortgage originator to refer
you to someone good. They love to hand out referrals.
A reverse mortgage is also not a direct value-to-dollar loan. In
other words, they aren’t going to lend you the actual value of your
home; what they lend is a percentage of that value, based on age,
interest rates, and area. For example, a 66-year-old in a high-end
county with a $500,000 home may expect to receive around
$163,000 with a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (depending on
interest rates). Don’t expect the full value of your home, or you’ll
be very disappointed. Before you make plans to spend money you
don’t yet have, go online to www.reversemortgage.org and click
on the reverse mortgage calculator. This very cool tool gives you
an estimate of what you may be able to borrow. Remember, you’re
not selling your home for the amount you’re lent — you are simply
borrowing equity that you already own.
Lastly, a reverse mortgage is not a panacea, or some kind of all-
encompassing loan that’s right for everyone. Just because you
qualify by being a 62-year-old homeowner doesn’t mean you’re an
ideal candidate. The next chapter lays out some questions you can
ask yourself to find out whether or not a reverse mortgage is right
for you, but here are a few of the basics:
 Are you at least 62 and own your own home?
 Do you plan to be in your home for at least 5 years?
 If you’re getting the loan to purchase or pay off something
specific, have you looked into other options for financing
those expenses?
 Are you comfortable with the terms of the loan?
The more of these questions you can answer “yes” to, the more
ready you are for a reverse mortgage. When you feel you meet all
of these suggested criteria, you’re ready to seek out a reverse
mortgage counselor (see Chapter 8).
Choosing a Loan Product
There are two ways to pick a reverse mortgage loan product: 
 Throw darts at a list of mortgage products and see which one
fate chooses for you.
 Talk to your counselor and originator and let them lay out
your options for you in an easy-to-understand, straightfor-
ward manner.
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
14

We suggest the last one. Besides, you could put an eye out with
those darts. 
Part of the reverse mortgage process involves using your best
judgment and the tools at your disposal (the plethora of informa-
tion your counselor and originator give you) to make an informed
and wise decision. No pressure, right? Actually, it can be a pretty
easy choice to make once you see what each loan product has to
offer and how each fits into with your goals and financial plans.
Keep in mind that all loans have the same basic requirements, but
they each have their little idiosyncrasies that may make one a
clear choice for you.
Home Equity Conversion Mortgage
By far the most prevalent of the three main options, the Home
Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM, sometimes pronounced heck-
um; look in Chapter 5 for more details) provides the most payment
choices, low interest rates, and the added mental security of being
insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), a government organization. Take a look at some of the main
points of an HECM loan:
 The loan is calculated based on the age of the youngest quali-
fied borrower.
 Eligible homes include most single-family, condos, townhouses,
and manufactured homes built after 1976 (ask your originator
about HUD guidelines and requirements for manufactured
homes).
 Lending limits (the amount you can borrow, also called the
principal) are lower than other options, yet you can often get
a higher principal than you would with others because of
lower interest rates.
 Loans top out at $312,896 in high-home-value areas, $172,632
in lower-home-value areas (based on 2005 county lending
limits).
 Interest rates can be based on monthly interest adjustments
or annual adjustments (you won’t pay anything until the loan
is due, it just accumulates).
 Your money is easily accessible and payment options are very
flexible.
Do these benefits sound like a good fit for you? If so, what the
heck-um are you waiting for? Flip to Chapter 8 and make an
appointment with a reverse mortgage counselor today. 
Chapter 1: Figuring Out the Reverse Mortgage Basics 15

Home Keeper
There are two loans created by Fannie Mae, America’s largest loan
funder, but they both have the same basic foundation. Since the
Home Keeper and the Home Keeper for Purchase were modeled
after the HECM, you may see lots of similarities when you look
closer in Chapter 6. There are, however, some quirks that separate
these loans from the pack:
 Home Keeper for Purchase lets you use a reverse mortgage to
help buy a new home.
 Loan calculations are based on the combined ages of the qual-
ifying borrowers, so married couples get less than singles.
 Eligible homes are single-family homes, condos, homes in
planned unit development projects, townhouses, or manufac-
tured homes that meet Fannie Mae requirements.
 Lending limits are based on an adjusted property value, which
is a national lending limit rather than a county limit.
 The national lending limit is $359,650 (based on 2005 lending
limits).
 Home Keeper often costs less than HECM but you’ll probably
receive less money in the long run.
Although Fannie Mae’s Home Keeper loans may not bring you as
much income as an HECM, their benefits (such as the ability to buy
a new house with the reverse mortgage money) may make these
the loans for you.
Jumbo Cash Accounts
For the house-rich among you, the Financial Freedom Cash
Account is probably your best bet. Although it doesn’t offer the
flexibility of the other two major loans, Financial Freedom’s
reverse mortgage provides bundles of cash that HECM and Home
Keeper only dream of. Chapter 7 goes into detail about the loan,
but here are some of its general characteristics:
 There’s no maximum lending limit; in theory, you could get a
cash account reverse mortgage on a $20 million mansion and
expect to receive a pretty hefty amount.
 Designed for homes valued at $359,651 or above (but is best
when your home is worth at least $700,000).
 Almost all homes will qualify, including some co-ops.
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
16

 Interest rates and fees are usually higher than other loans.
 There are three types of Cash Accounts — each with different
costs involved — that may generate different available funds
for you.
If reverse mortgages aren’t for everyone, then the Cash Account 
is for even fewer — rates and fees are higher, and there are some
restrictions to the ways you can withdraw your money. However, 
if you own a high-priced home the tradeoff is probably worth it.
Consult your counselor and financial planner about your Cash
Account choices.
Figuring Out the People 
in Your Mortgage
Unlike most loans in today’s Internet-crazy world, you can’t simply
go online and get a reverse mortgage from a pool of competing
lenders. Reverse mortgages are a highly personal, interactive loan,
and there are several people who make them happen and help you
out along the way. Work closely with these people and let yourself
be helped. You know what’s best for you, but they know reverse
mortgages. Together, you’re an unstoppable equity-borrowing
machine.
Counselor
Your first stop on the road to reverse mortgages is the counselor.
They’re not here to analyze your childhood or interpret your
dreams; instead, these counselors offer up sound advice and the
information necessary for you to make an informed decision 
about your own loan. They are required to remain completely 
unbiased and can only give you the facts — they never tell you
what to choose or take away your power to make the best choice
for you. It sounds great now, but come choosing time, you may
probably wish someone would just tell you what to do!
Even the most independent homeowners are required to seek the
advice and educational offerings of an approved counselor.
Typically, an “approved” counselor refers to HUD-approved, but
Fannie Mae and Financial Freedom each have their own set of pre-
ferred counselors. Unless you know for a fact that you need the
Home Keeper or Cash Account loan, it’s usually best to see a HUD
counselor. These professionals are acceptable for any of the major
loans discussed in this book, and if you decide to get an HECM
Chapter 1: Figuring Out the Reverse Mortgage Basics 17

(even after you’ve been to a Fannie Mae or Financial Freedom
counselor) you still need to make an appointment with a HUD
counselor as well. You can save time and energy by going to a 
HUD-approved counselor from the get-go.
Many counselors (especially HUD) operate free of charge, although
some have a nominal fee for their services (usually around $75).
Unless you live in an area where the only counselor for 50 miles
charges a fee, try to use one who’s free. The ones who charge offer
the same exact information, so if you have a choice, go with the
free ride.
During your counseling session, the counselor asks you all sorts of
personal questions about your finances, your health, your family,
your home, and your lifestyle. Don’t keep anything from them or
stretch the truth even a little bit. Counselors only have about an
hour with you and need all the information they can get in that
time to show you the options that may work best for you. It can be
a bit off-putting to spill the beans to a stranger, but it’s necessary
to make a smart decision regarding your loan. You can rest assured
that counselor sessions are completely confidential — only you
and your counselor have access to the information you provide,
unless, of course, you bring someone with you to the meeting.
It’s a good idea to bring along any trusted family members or
friends who may be able to help you get a better perspective,
supply information, ask questions you hadn’t even thought of, or
just lend you some moral support. Counselors encourage families
to come together, and you may probably find that you’re glad to
have someone else there. This isn’t a requirement by any means,
but consider it when you make your appointment. For more on
counselors, how to find them, and what to expect at an appoint-
ment, flip ahead to Chapter 8.
Originator
Your originator is the person who sets your loan in motion. The
originator meets with you to determine whether the loan you’ve
decided on is really the best for your unique circumstances, helps
you fill out the application, and submits it to the underwriters
(who verify your information) and the lender (who actually signs
your checks). You’ll probably have at least two meetings with the
originator: one to fill out the application and another to finalize
details at closing. However, most people end up at their originator’s
office three, four, or more times over the course of their loan
process. You may not choose a loan to apply to right away, have
questions regarding your loan in progress, need to bring in 
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
18

additional information, or a whole host of other reasons to visit.
That’s why you and your originator become such close friends
before your loan is completed.
Time is money, and although originators don’t charge by the hour,
there are fees involved for originators’ services. Many of the fees
you see on the Good Faith Estimate originators are required to pro-
vide are additional closing costs unrelated to the originator’s
efforts. A Good Faith Estimate lists all of the approximate costs
involved in getting your loan, from appraisal services to stamps.
All told, these fees can add up to several thousand dollars. That’s a
whole lotta cash to plunk down all at once, and the originators 
and lenders realize that it may present a burden. After all, if you
had a few thousand dollars to spend, you may not need this loan.
Because of this, you can roll the amount of most, if not all of your
fees and closing costs into your loan. That way, the costs are
absorbed into the reverse mortgage and become spread out over
several years. 
Finding a reverse mortgage originator is easy once you know
where to look. Chapter 9 gives you all the tools you need to find a
great originator, but keep these points in mind when you’re nar-
rowing down the search:
 Originators should be experienced in reverse mortgages.
Do not pick a traditional loan originator, because they proba-
bly don’t have the expertise that a reverse mortgage origina-
tor has.
 While it’s not a requirement, you may feel better if your
originator is a member of the National Reverse Mortgage
Lenders Association (NRMLA). They have access to all kinds
of resources and materials that others may not.
 Your originator should be patient, never pressure you, and
encourage your family to attend your meetings (if you feel
comfortable having them there).
 Most of all, you have to feel comfortable with your origina-
tor. If he or she doesn’t feel like someone you’d trust with
your future financial well being, trust your instincts. You won’t
hurt his or her feelings.
Appraiser
Unlike the counselor and originator (who hold meetings at their
office), the appraiser comes to you. No matter which reverse mort-
gage product you decide on, an appraiser is required to come out
to your home and give it the once over to determine its value.
Chapter 1: Figuring Out the Reverse Mortgage Basics 19

Depending on home values in your area and the last time you had
your home appraised, you may be pleasantly surprised to find out
what your home is worth in today’s market. Keep in mind that
appraisals are largely subjective, and although they follow a certain
protocol, appraisers have to simply use their best judgment to set
your home’s fair market value. Chapter 10 gives a full description
of what goes on in the appraisal, including what the appraiser
looks for.
The appraisal visit is nothing to worry about, as long as you’ve
kept up your home maintenance over the years. Either way, it
couldn’t hurt to do a bit of sprucing up; clear your yard of any
debris, clean your home the way your would if very special com-
pany was coming over, and fix any little things that you’ve been
putting off if you can reasonably afford to do it. Also, gather up
your home records — if you’ve ever had work done on the home
(and who hasn’t?) try to find those statements. The appraiser will
be impressed by a home that’s well-kept, but they won’t be
impressed by receipts for granite countertops. Don’t start waving
your credit card statement under the appraiser’s nose to prove
how much you spent refurbishing the master suite. The money you
put into a home never fetches an equal value when it’s appraised.
Since you can’t sway the appraiser’s evaluation with cookies or
compliments, the best thing you can do during the process is sit
back and let him or her work. Be ready to answer questions, but
don’t hover or even follow the appraiser from room to room. If you
need something to do, make a list of all the fabulous things you can
do with your reverse mortgage income.

Straightening out the facts
Lending limits, loan value, and home value can be misleading terms. When your
home is appraised, the value is not necessarily equal to the amount of money you
can borrow. In fact, you’d have to be very, very old to get a loan for 100 percent of
your home’s value — we’re talking born around the turn of the century. Lenders
factor in your age, current interest rates (they change constantly, more on that
shortly), and earned equity to come up with a percentage of the home value that
they can lend. The younger you are (early 60’s to early 70’s), the less they are going
to approve because they know that you will probably stay in the home longer than
someone in their 80’s or 90’s. So, while your home may be worth $250,000, they may
only lend you $125,000.

Getting Paid
Of course, what you’re really interested in is the money. This is one
time in your life when it’s perfectly okay to be focused on material
things. After all, that’s what a reverse mortgage is all about — 
lending you the money you need to buy the things you want. This
is also the easiest part of getting a reverse mortgage: The lender
determines how much you can borrow and you simply pick your
payment option and start receiving money. No sweat. Still, there
are some things you need to know about payments, your current
financial issues, and the country’s financial issues before you make
a decision.
Figuring out how much you can get 
Without sitting down with an originator, there’s no way to tell you
for sure what you can borrow from a reverse mortgage. We wish
we could give you a simple formula, but there just isn’t one. As we
mention in this chapter (and elsewhere), the amount you can
borrow is calculated using: 
 Your age: Generally, the older you are, the better off your loan
situations because the lender figures it won’t have to work on
your loan as long as if you were a spring chicken.
 Your home value: More equity equals more money available
to borrow.
 Your area: Higher home values in the area means higher loan
values for you if you choose an HECM or Home Keeper (which
both use county medians to determine your loan principal).
 Interest rates: This is the one factor where less is more — the
lower the interest rates, the higher the principal.
If you can wait a few years to get your loan, it will be worth it in the
increased principal. Most people who wait at least five years are
pleasantly surprised to find their loan amount has gone up . . . to
the tune of a few thousand dollars. Don’t wait so long that you
can’t enjoy the cash flow — that trip down the canals of Venice will
probably be a lot more fun at 68 than at 98 — but don’t rush out
and get a loan on your 62nd birthday if you don’t really need it yet.
Also, each loan has its own system of determining loan value. For
example, no matter what your home is worth, Fannie Mae’s Home
Keeper bases the amount available to you on a scale as compared
to the national lending limit ($359,650). On the other hand, the
Chapter 1: Figuring Out the Reverse Mortgage Basics 21

Cash Account has no set limit. It bases its principal solely on your
age, home value, and interest rates.
You can get an estimate of what each loan may be able to offer you
using online reverse mortgage calculators. The NRMLA calculator
(find it at www.reversemortgage.org) is a good indicator because
it breaks down the entire loan, from what your estimated costs are
to how much you get per month. However, they don’t show you
what you could get with a Cash Account, only HECM and Home
Keeper. For a side-by-side comparison of all three loans, visit www.
financialfreedom.com and take a spin on its reverse mortgage
calculator.
Checking out payment options
You know how lottery winners get to choose whether they want
their money in installments or one lump sum? Well you may feel
like you won the lottery when you decide how you want your
reverse mortgage funds to arrive. Each loan has its own set of pay-
ment options (that’s payment to you, from the lender). Listed here
are the main payment options, along with which loans offer them.
As you read down the list, think about which one would fit best in
your lifestyle.
 Tenure (HECM and Home Keeper): If you like the security of
having stable, steady monthly checks deposited in your bank
account, monthly tenure payments may be for you. The
biggest advantage of this option is that no matter how long
you have the loan (stay in your home), the lender continues
to pay you — even if you’ve gone beyond what the lender
originally agreed to lend you, and even if you live 30 years
longer than anyone expected. The downside is that fixed
monthly payments don’t allow for sudden large expenses and
don’t adjust for inflation down the road.
 Term (HECM and Home Keeper): A monthly term payment
has the security of getting equal monthly checks like the
tenure plan, but you decide how long you continue to receive
payments. The shorter the term, the more money you get per
check. For example, if a lender sets your principal at $100,000
and you want to receive it over eight years, that’s about
$1,041 per month. If you decide instead to get your payments
over five years, you’re looking at $1,666 per month. That’s a
sizeable difference! But remember, once that term is over,
you’re out of money.
 Lump sum (HECM, Home Keeper, and one Cash Account
option): Have you always dreamed of rolling around on a pile
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
22

of money? Choosing a lump sum means you get the entire
amount of the loan in one big check. It’s up to you how you
want to budget it per month, and it’s up to you to make sure it
lasts as long as you plan to live in your home. If you have a
very large expense that you absolutely must pay in full, a
lump sum could do the trick, although a better option is often
a line of credit (see the next bullet).
 Line of credit (HECM, Home Keeper, Cash Account): A line of
credit (also called a credit line) works very much like a sav-
ings account. You have access to the entire loan amount, but
since you have to send in a form to get it, people are often
more mindful of how their money is spent than they may be
with a lump sum. In addition, depending on the loan, you can
earn interest on the money you haven’t yet borrowed.
 Combination (HECM and Home Keeper): Can’t decide? Maybe
a combination of payment options is your best bet. You can
choose how much you want to receive upfront (through a
lump sum, line of credit, or both) and designate the rest to a
monthly payment. Or work backward — figure out how much
you need per month, multiply that by the number of months
you expect to stay in your home, and leave the rest in a line of
credit. The combinations are virtually endless because they’re
tailor-made for you.
Discovering the effect of the 
funds on your finances
Seniors, especially those who have gone through hoops trying to
get their fair share of Social Security, pensions, Medicaid, and vari-
ous other programs, are often concerned that a reverse mortgage
may cancel out those benefits. People often ask us if they have to
choose between those programs and a reverse mortgage. You
should be glad to know that the answer is no. The income from a
reverse mortgage has no bearing on your current benefits. What’s
better, it has no effect on your taxes because equity isn’t consid-
ered income by the IRS.
Of course, every rule has an exception. Although most people
won’t have any trouble maintaining their current benefits, some
government programs (such as Supplemental Security Income)
may include reverse mortgage payments in their income limits. If
so, there are usually ways around this. Talk to your counselor and
originator about working out a system to circumvent this issue. If
you want to err on the side of caution, talk to your tax advisor or
financial planner about how your newfound income may impact
Chapter 1: Figuring Out the Reverse Mortgage Basics 23

your finances. In the vast majority of cases, the only effect is a 
positive one.
Dealing with inflation 
and interest rates
Any time you’re investigating a mortgage, you’re sure to have your
eye on interest rates. In recent years, rates have been quite low,
although they are slowly creeping back up again. What does this
mean for reverse mortgages? Just as in traditional mortgages, the
lower interest rates are, the more money you can borrow. But
unlike traditional mortgages, you don’t pay a penny of that interest
until the loan is over. It accumulates over time and is paid all at
once when you repay the entire loan.
Aside from the initial closing costs and originator’s fees, interest
can be thought of as the price of borrowing money. The longer you
have your reverse mortgage, the more you pay over the years in
interest. Rates will fluctuate up and down during your loan — you
can drive yourself crazy trying to follow the trends and track rates.
But there’s really no point. Once you have the loan, the best thing
to do is forget about it. You can’t control the market, and although
you’ll see your interest rate on your monthly or quarterly state-
ment, you won’t feel its effects until you end the loan. 
One financial indicator that you may notice as the years go by is
inflation. Think about the cost of your staple items 20 years ago —
prices rise on an average of about 1.5 percent per year. It may not
sound like much, but when you consider it on a large scale, it
makes a big difference. A loan worth $75,000 this year only buys
$73,875 worth of goods and services the next year. Why is this
important to reverse mortgage borrowers? Unlike income from a
job, you won’t get a raise for cost of living with a reverse mortgage.
That means if you’re on a fixed $900 per month payment option,
that $900 isn’t going to go as far if you hold the loan for 10 or 20
years. A line of credit is a good way to beat inflation since, on an
HECM loan, you actually earn interest on unused funds, which will
help you keep up with rising prices.
The very savvy among you may see a great opportunity here to get
the best of both worlds: stable monthly payments and an easy way
to combat inflation. The solution is a combination of payment
options. An HECM loan lets you set aside a portion of your princi-
pal for a line of credit and then receive the rest as monthly income.
You can access the line of credit funds at any time, but by leaving
them where they are, you build a greater equity savings. Skip ahead
to Chapter 5 to see an example of how this could work for you.

Chapter 2
Deciding Whether a Reverse
Mortgage Is Right for You
In This Chapter
 Knowing your motives
 Investigating other options
 Understanding when to walk away
You may have heard about reverse mortgages on the radio or
from a friend, and you probably want to know if a reverse
mortgage is right for you or someone close to you. While we can’t
tell you in these pages definitively whether this loan is the answer
to your financial wishes — only you and your lending professionals,
your counselor (see Chapter 8) and originator (see Chapter 9), can
decide that — we can give you a head start. You need to consider
several things before you get started on a reverse mortgage, and
it’s a good idea if you know from the get go whether or not you’re a
likely candidate. The reverse mortgage isn’t free money. 
It can be an expensive way to meet your financial needs, and 
the decision to get a loan shouldn’t be taken lightly. For some, a
reverse mortgage isn’t the answer — and that’s what you’re here 
to find out.
In this chapter you can begin to see how a reverse mortgage can
impact your life and how to tell if it’s a good choice for you and
your family. We also give you brief descriptions of alternatives,
along with a pre-counseling checklist.
Pinpointing Your Motives
You probably already have a good idea of how you’d like to spend
your reverse mortgage money. You may want some material things,
such as making home improvements, or you may need the basics,
such as paying for food and overdue bills. Whatever your motives

for seeking out a reverse mortgage, you need to weigh the costs
versus the benefits of getting a loan and make sure that you don’t
have other options that may better suit your needs.
Before you go to see a reverse mortgage originator (see Chapter 9),
sit down and think about exactly why you want this loan, and what
you’re willing to pay for it. Is your peace of mind worth $3,000 in
closing costs? Is your remodeled kitchen going to be worth the
extra $12,000 in interest? (See Chapter 4 for a breakdown of fees
and potential interest costs.) It’s important to weigh these points,
because although you get a three-day right of rescission (three
days in which to change your mind after the loan closes), most
people don’t get a whopping case of buyer’s remorse in the first
three days. You’re still too busy making out your “to-buy” list for at
least the first month, and by that time it’s too late to go back. 
So you should not only talk with your family and your counselor
(see Chapter 8) about the loan and what that loan can mean for
your quality of life, but also read this section to assess your needs
and wants, which can give you a good idea of whether you need a
reverse mortgage in the first place.
Determining what you need
Human needs can be broken into categories, with some areas car-
rying more weight than others — like a what-you-need pyramid. At
the base of the pyramid, you may place things like food and shel-
ter, and toward the top, less tangible items such as self-esteem and
independence. Reverse mortgages can address all of the essential
human needs when the mortgage is taken out responsibly and in
your best interests. It can help pay for your basic needs, while
affording a sense of peace and financial independence that only
comes with the security of money in the bank.
As great as that sounds, reverse mortgages aren’t a magic solution
for every household. Before you start buying up toys and time-
shares, create a detailed budget of what you need per month. The
things you need depends on how loosely you use the term, but you
can consider the things you need as the non-extravagant items that
get you from day to day. Food, medicines, health care, a safe place
to live, electricity, water, gas, car payment, insurance, taxes —
these are all needs that you’ve probably become accustomed to.
Include everything from toothpaste to home repairs to your pet’s
medications . . . anything you wouldn’t be willing to forego. 
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
26

Preparing a needs budget
To account for your needs, simply look to your wallet. Each of your
essential needs has a price, and knowing what you spend your
money on is an easy way to focus in on your true needs versus
your want-to-haves. Start paying attention to every item or service
you pay for, and write it all down in a specially designated note-
book or pad that you can carry with you. After a few weeks, take a
hard look at your list and circle the expenses that you simply aren’t
willing to give up. These are the things you personally need. Now
consider what your needs alone are costing you per month. It can
be a shock to see how quickly it adds up! Check out Table 2-1 for a
sample needs budget. Notice that the list of needs isn’t strictly
food and shelter, but also costs that have become associated with
this imaginary senior’s standard of living.

You can see how quickly these things add up. Now take an honest
assessment of your own list. Determine if you can pay for all of
these needs now. If not, figure out how much more money you
need to meet your expenses. Don’t forget to consider cutting back
on your expenses to meet your budget (see the section “Paring
down your needs,” later in this chapter, for more on budgeting
tighter).
However, even when you live on a tight budget, your expenses may
be more than you can handle. Many people find that their pennies
are pinched so tightly they’ve got “one cent” permanently imbed-
ded in their thumbs, and yet their monthly expenses still come up
higher than their monthly income affords. A reverse mortgage can
change all that, giving you the extra padding you need to keep your
life running normally, without giving up your necessities. If the
things you need have become the things you’re struggling to get, a
reverse mortgage may be able to give you the economic boost you
need to make ends meet.
Paring down your needs
When you look at what you spend each month, or even each week,
you may be shocked by how much money goes flying out of your
wallet. You spend $5 here and $2 there, which all seems perfectly
harmless until you realize that you’ve spent $150 in one month on
ceramic toothbrush holders and yet another pair of slippers.
We would never tell someone not to buy the things they really need.
By all means, if your feet are cold, buy more slippers. But first, take
a peek under the bed and see if you can save yourself a few bucks
by using what you already have. We know a woman who moved out
of her home after 10 years and found 38 pairs of nearly identical
sunglasses throughout her house — she just kept buying new ones
each time they were lost. At $10 a pair, that’s $380 down the drain.
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
28

You may be surprised at how much you can save by simply elimi-
nating one small thing. While this is by no means a complete list,
here are some simple suggestions to get you thinking about how
you can reduce some of your expenses: 
 Try going to the movies less frequently. If you can’t forego
having a weekly movie night or several nights a week dedi-
cated to movies, try renting or hit the matinees (and don’t
forget to ask for the senior discount!).
 Consider getting your hair done every 12 weeks, rather
than every 6 weeks.
 Assess whether you really need to go shopping for junk at
the bargain store every weekend.
 Experiment with different, less expensive brands at the 
grocery store.
 Sniff out the bargains. Check out whether you can find a simi-
lar item somewhere else for a better price.
 Keep track of your things. If you find yourself repurchasing
things because you lost the original . . . for the sixth time, per-
haps you can devise a way to make sure the items you lose
most often have a special place of residence.
 Pare down to basic cable (who really watches all those chan-
nels anyway?) and you could save about $400 per year.
 Make coffee at home every morning instead of going out to a
café and you could save around $900 per year!
Hopefully, this list gets you thinking about your spending habits —
perhaps you don’t need more money, just less spending! Many sen-
iors need to make every dollar count, especially since newly retired
people may not be used to living on such a fixed income. It takes
some planning and careful spending to make any income, including
a reverse mortgage, work for your budget.
If you can afford your current lifestyle by budgeting a little tighter,
you may not need a reverse mortgage for your daily living.
Mortgages cost thousands of dollars in fees, interest, and little 
incidentals. You may be able to skip all that hassle and expense by
simply watching your wallet a bit closer. If you think you’ll need
access to more money in the future (your income is running out or
you’re expecting big medical bills) you may be able to wait a few
years and still save yourself some money. On the other hand, if you
need a little extra so that your necessities don’t have your wallet
running on empty, a reverse mortgage may be just the thing.
Chapter 2: Deciding Whether a Reverse Mortgage Is Right for You 29

Deciphering what you want
We all want something. We may say we’re contented or deny that
we want anything for our birthdays, but in reality there are always
things we want. Oftentimes the things we want are trumped by the
things we need, and those glimmering wants are just out of reach.
Maybe you’re living comfortably now, but can’t afford to take that
dream vacation or start your own business. Maybe you have quite
enough to get by, but don’t want to spend your entire savings on
remodeling your home to accommodate a first-floor master suite.
Or maybe all you want is peace of mind, knowing that although 
you don’t feel you need to live lavishly, you’re safe with a steady
stream of income. A reverse mortgage can be the answer to getting
some of the things you want without strapping for funds in the
future.
Reverse mortgages can certainly be a miracle in the form of an
electronic transfer for some people, but many others are disap-
pointed that their loan didn’t afford them a small fortune. If you
had a plan for your money before you even picked up this book,
consider whether the things you want could really be funded with
the money you’d get from a reverse mortgage as well as whether
you’d be able to live out your retirement on whatever’s left. A
reverse mortgage is not a bottomless cash purse — although
you’re certainly free to do whatever you like with your money,
remember that reverse mortgages can be a costly decision. Enjoy
your retirement, but be sure to exercise the same financial discre-
tion you would with any other limited funds.
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage

Checking out the most-wanted list
Reverse mortgages have helped thousands of people get the things they wanted in
life. Lender Web sites are full of stories about seniors who took off on motorcycles
across the Mojave Desert, paid for college tuition (whether for a grandchild or them-
selves), or made a point of going out to eat at their favorite swanky restaurant every
month. That’s part of the beauty of a reverse mortgage; although it’s a loan from the
equity in your home, you can use the money for whatever you want. There are no
limitations, no quid pro quo, nothing to stop you from enjoying that cash to its fullest,
greenest, most E Pluribus Unum potential. Just for fun, go to www.financial
freedom.com and click on “consumer” then “testimonials” for real-life tales of
seniors who got exactly what they wanted. Who knows? That could be you up there
someday! 

To assess the costs of your wants and how those costs impact
your reverse mortgage, follow these steps to create your wants list
(Table 2-2 gives you an example):
1. Write down a list of all the things you really want.
2. Record how much each item costs.
3. Total the costs of the items.
4. Subtract the approximate cost of the reverse mortgage to
see how much money you’d have left.
Table 2-2 
Sample Wants List
Want: Two-month trip to Italy
Estimated cost

In Table 2-2’s example, the borrowers would have a remaining
$82,253 after they took care of their lifelong dream of touring Italy.
That works out to about $685 per month if they stay in their home
for the next ten years. If you take a look at the needs list in Table
2-1 (see the earlier section “Determining what you need”) you can
easily see that if this couple has the same kind of needs as reflected
in Table 2-1, they are going to need a lot more money if they plan to
live on their reverse mortgage alone.

Find out approximately how much you can borrow by going to the
National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA) Web site
and clicking on “calculator.” From there, just enter your specifica-
tions (age, home value, zip code, debts), and the calculator can
give you an estimate of what you may be able to get. Keep in mind
that it’s just an estimate. Until you sign the closing documents, you
are really only operating on an assumption.
Of course, you know that with money comes responsibility. You’re
an adult. You’ve handled finances before and can most likely bal-
ance your own budget. But it can be awfully tempting to overex-
tend your money when you’re expecting a check in the mail for
$80,000. Don’t put a down payment on that yacht until you know
what you can actually afford after you consider your needs and
wants, or you may find yourself in over your head.

Rooting for single, senior women
Ladies, did you know that you’re outliving men nearly three-to-one? It may not be
surprising that with men’s earlier mortality, our collective higher divorce rates, and
fewer women feeling the need to marry at all, single women make up a very signif-
icant portion of the senior population in America. It may come as no surprise then
that nearly half of all reverse mortgage borrowers are single women. That’s right
sister, you’re not alone.
While it’s true that the number of couples who take out reverse mortgage loans are
on the rise, you single gals still make up the largest percentage of all reverse mort-
gage borrowers. Good originators should know this and need to talk to you about
your understanding of your own finances before you get started with the loan. That
said, they should never talk down to you or treat you like a child — whether you’re
male, female, senior citizen, or middle-aged, originators must give you the respect
that they would bestow upon any other customer.
A large majority of single senior women are widows. Many come from a mindset,
as you may have, in which the husbands took care of all the money stuff and the
wives took care of the house and children. If your husband dealt with the mortgage
process when you bought your current home and you weren’t part of it, you may
not have any experience with home loans. That system was fine for the times, but
today there are a lot of senior women out there who are uncomfortable with finan-
cial dealings and prefer to let someone — anyone — else handle it. The light at the
end of this unbalanced financial tunnel is that the next generation of senior women
will probably be more financially sophisticated. Many Baby Boomer women run
their own businesses, hold high-powered financial jobs, and manage households —
to them, getting a reverse mortgage will be like ordering pizza.
You may find that the thought of taking out a loan on your own and making such a
big economic decision is enough to make your stomach ache and your knees feel

Keeping Your Options Open
There are some cases in which a reverse mortgage just isn’t right
for you. There are a few main alternatives that counselors often
suggest when a reverse mortgage is too costly, or your profile
doesn’t fit with the needs of a typical reverse mortgage borrower. If
your counselor feels that one may be a better choice for you, take
his or her advice to heart. You can always reconsider when your
situation changes. Check out Chapter 8 for more information about
these options:
 Waiting: In many cases, waiting a few years to get a reverse
mortgage really pays off. Since the lender calculates your loan
partially based on age, the older you are, the more money you
will most likely receive. Interest rates play a big part in deter-
mining your loan amount as well — when rates are low, you
can probably expect a more out of your reverse mortgage. In a
low interest rate market, you can figure on an extra $8,000 to
$15,000 for every five years you wait, depending on the value
of your home. If you can afford to hold off for five years (or
more) it’s definitely worth it. For example, if you’re 65, own a
$200,000 home, and are considering an HECM loan, you could
probably get about $10,000 more out of your loan if you
waited until you were 70. On the other hand, higher interest
rates will produce less available funds. If rates seem to be
rising, you may want to jump on current rates before they get
too high. Either way, don’t wait too long — you want to have
time to enjoy your newfound financial independence.
 State loans: Some state loans, like the Deferred Payment Loan
(DPL), work like a reverse mortgage — they give you money
and you pay it back when your leave your home permanently.
But there’s a catch . . . the DPL can only be used for a specific
purpose, usually to repair something dangerous or unlivable
in your home, whereas a regular reverse mortgage can be used
for anything your heart desires. Another option is property

weak. It could be love, but it’s probably mortgage flu. This is completely normal, but
it doesn’t give you a license to be removed from your reverse mortgage process.
The prescription? Education and great counselors and originators.
One part of the process that will help tremendously is your trip to the counselor’s
office (see Chapter 8). Counselors are a required step in getting a reverse mortgage.
They know that this may not be easy for you, and it’s their job to help you feel at
ease with whatever decision you make. You can ask all the questions you want, and
the counselor won’t think any of them are silly. 

tax deferrals that allow you to forego paying your property
taxes for a while. These vary by state; some let you defer your
payments forever, some only for a set timeframe. Both of
these state loans offer very low interest and very low closing
costs (if any). Check with your counselor (for more on talking
with a counselor, see Chapter 8) to find out if other state loans
exist in your area.
 Selling your home: This is often the obvious answer to your
problems — sell your home, use the money to buy something
smaller or simpler to maintain or easier to maneuver around,
and live on the excess money from the sale of your house. If
you think you’ll be moving soon anyway, selling your home is
usually the way to go. This assumes, of course, that you want
to move, and that your home is worth enough to buy a new
home with the equity. If you live in an average town in the
Midwest and think you can buy a condo in San Diego with
your equity, you’re in for a big surprise. Housing prices vary
greatly across the country, so do your homework if you plan
to retire in another area. 
Another non-traditional alternative to selling your home is to
work out an agreement in which someone (usually a family
member or friend) buys your home and rents it to you for a
nominal fee. They get the benefit of the home’s appreciation,
and you get to stay in your home, collect on the sale of the
house, and reduce your payments. Still, some people prefer
not to mix family and money, and for good reason. Be sure to
discuss this kind of arrangement in detail, and involve a real
estate professional if appropriate.
 Sharing space: Your financial situation might be such that you
don’t need a huge sum of money for any big vacation or fancy
new bathroom. You just need money for the essentials or to
supplement your Social Security. Your counselor could bring
up the idea of sharing a home with a friend or relative in a
similar situation. Do you have a sibling or sewing club friend
who is also in need of a little monthly help? Invite them to live
in your spare bedroom, charge them a fair rent, and meet your
monthly requirements. You may also consider moving in with
an adult child. This is an ideal situation for some families, but
it can be a huge lifestyle change and is not a decision to be
taken lightly.
 Refinancing with a forward mortgage: Okay, maybe the idea
of having a new payment to worry about doesn’t thrill you,
but if you can reduce your payments, a forward mortgage may
help cushion the savings or retirement income you’re living
off of today. ARMs (adjustable rate mortgages) always have
lower interest rates, which means a lower monthly payment.
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
34

Keep in mind that because forward ARM interest rates change
frequently (usually once per year) what may have been a
great interest rate last year can suddenly skyrocket next year.
If you’re uncomfortable with an unpredictable interest rate, an
ARM may not be the best choice for you.
Home Equity Lines of Credit can also be a good option, offer-
ing another way to use your equity now. Downsides are that
they sometimes have a higher interest rate over the long
term; they have a minimum monthly payment (that’s you
paying the lender); and some have a balloon payment built in,
which forces you to pay more after a certain time period.
 Public assistance: Many people think of public assistance as a
negative, and would often rather protect their pride than get
the help they need. Don’t be one of those people. Public assis-
tance is nothing to be ashamed of, and can give you all kinds
of breaks on daily expenses. There are meal delivery programs
for those who can’t cook anymore (whether it’s due to inade-
quate funds or mobility), prescription drug benefits, medical
assistance, transportation for those who can’t drive, in-home
helpers, and many, many more opportunities for help. Several
resources aren’t being utilized by enough people. You’ve paid
for these public assistance programs through taxes all your
working life. This is the time to reap the benefits of your own
tax dollars.
A great resource for all types of help is the Area Agency on
Aging. They can give you information about some of the
options listed here, plus reduced energy bills, tax support,
and more. Contact them at 800-677-1116 or online at www.
eldercare.gov. Another great resource is a Web site called
www.BenefitsCheckup.org. BenefitsCheckup is sponsored
by the National Council on the Aging and works by creating a
profile of you and your needs and matching it to all the pro-
grams out there that may be able to help you. All you have to
do is fill out a questionnaire and let the Web site do the work.
Your results will include information about each organization
and how to contact them to apply for benefits. 
Of course, with hundreds of thousands of individual circumstances,
your counselor may be able suggest another alternative that’s
tailor made just for you. The point is: You have options. Just
because you’re reading up on reverse mortgages doesn’t mean
you’re locked into a loan. Before you meet with your counselor or
your originator, keep an open mind to all options so you find what
works best for you.
Chapter 2: Deciding Whether a Reverse Mortgage Is Right for You 35

Knowing When to Walk Away
If reverse mortgages were the absolute best choice for every
homeowner over age 62, we wouldn’t need this book. The reality 
is, a reverse mortgage is a complicated loan with a lot of specifica-
tions and calculations that make it supremely perfect for many
people, but a very wrong choice for others. Before you decide to
visit a reverse mortgage counselor, make sure you’re a good candi-
date for the loan by reading through this section.
Knowing when you shouldn’t 
get a reverse mortgage
As a rule of thumb, reverse mortgages are designed for people who
plan to live in their homes for at least five years (but more likely 8
to 12 years). Some senior homeowners are over optimistic about
their current living situations, believing that they can continue
living in their homes indefinitely, even though their doctor or con-
cerned family has other ideas. Others aren’t patient enough to wait
a few years to make the loan worthwhile before picking up and
moving to Cancun. Of course, if you’re on the elder end of the bor-
rower spectrum and need the funds from a reverse mortgage
despite the fact that you may only hold the loan for a couple of
years, don’t let that five-year timeframe keep you from seeking out
the loan. Again, only you and your lending professionals know
what’s right for you, but you’ll probably want to think twice about
getting a reverse mortgage if any of these apply to you:

Reverse mortgage, eh?
If you are a resident of Canada, you won’t be able to get a reverse mortgage through
FHA, Fannie Mae, or Financial Freedom. The answer to “is this loan for me?” is a
resounding “no.” So what’s a Canuck to do? Canada has its own brand of reverse
mortgage, called the Canadian Home Income Plan (CHIP), which was developed in
1986, just as the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage was coming into play. The
requirements are essentially the same as American reverse mortgages (see Chapter
3 for more on borrower qualifications for American reverse mortgages): You must
be 62, own your home, and have sufficient equity. Loans range from $20,000 to
$500,000, and repayment isn’t due until you’ve left your home permanently. To find
out more about the CHIP loan, email info@chip.ca, visit www.chip.ca, or call
866-522-2447.

 Your home is damaged beyond the point of repair. Reverse
mortgages are great for revamping a few rooms, or making a
home more accessible, but they don’t work miracles. Unlike
the shows you may have seen on TV, you won’t be able to tear
down your home and build a new one if there are major struc-
tural or foundation problems. Dangerous electrical or plumb-
ing may also be an issue. Sometimes it’s better to cut and run.
You may be able to purchase a new home with the Home
Keeper for Purchase (see Chapter 6 for information on this
loan), but don’t expect anyone to let you stay in a house that’s
crumbling.
 You’re young and have plenty of money. Just because you’re
62 doesn’t mean you need to run out and apply for a reverse
mortgage. The lenders aren’t going anywhere — there’s no
rush. In fact, as we noted earlier, the younger you are, the less
money you’ll get from your loan. If you can live off your nest
egg for a few years, wait to get your reverse mortgage. Not
only will you save money, you’ll get more money as well.
 You think you’ll want to move out in the next couple of
years. Reverse mortgages get less expensive the longer you
have them. Moving out too soon means you’ll pay more for
the privilege of having a loan, which is less money you’ll have
for your fun and extravagant lifestyle or for the needs you
took the loan out for in the first place. If you stay longer, you
win. A reverse mortgage isn’t usually the best short-term 
solution. Talk to your counselor (Chapter 8) and originator
(Chapter 9) to get a better idea of costs versus benefits.
 You are ill and don’t believe you’ll live as long as the lender
predicts. Just like moving out too soon, it doesn’t make sense
to take out a loan that you know you’ll never be able to fully
enjoy. Keep in mind, however, that sometimes need overrides
financial considerations and the reverse mortgage is still your
best choice. The loan may allow you to live out your last
years more comfortably than your could otherwise manage.
Make sure your counselor (see Chapter 8) explains the pros
and cons, and don’t be afraid to tell him or her about your
condition. They need to know all the facts.
 You have a spouse or other person living in your home who
doesn’t qualify for a reverse mortgage. The loan becomes
due and payable when the borrower (or last remaining bor-
rower) permanently leaves the residence. That means if you
get the loan when you’re 65 and your spouse is 57 and you die
or move out for any reason, your spouse will be responsible
for paying off your mortgage, which often means selling the
house. If you can’t add all residents to the mortgage, you may
want to wait or seek out a different option.
Chapter 2: Deciding Whether a Reverse Mortgage Is Right for You 37

Of course, this isn’t an extensive list. With hundreds of thousands
of individuals out there who may qualify for a reverse mortgages,
there are countless situations that could make a reverse mortgage
a less-desirable choice. The only way to know for sure is to visit a
reverse mortgage counselor and take his or her expertise into con-
sideration. To find out more about getting a certified counselor, flip
to Chapter 8.
Knowing if you’re ready
Before you make up your mind about pursuing a reverse mortgage,
take a minute to make sure you’re starting out on the right foot.
Having a strong foundation will make your loan process much
easier, both for you and for the professionals involved. Use this
checklist as you go through this book to keep track of your eligibil-
ity and progress, and make sure every item is checked off before
you seek out a reverse mortgage counselor:
 I am at least 62 years old.
 I own my own home.
 I have a good idea of what my home is worth. An appraisal
(see Chapter 10) will address this if you don’t already know
how much your home would hypothetically sell for.
 I understand how a reverse mortgage works (see Chapter 1).
 I have or will read up on the reverse mortgage products (see
Chapters 5, 6, and 7).
 I know what my monthly expenses are.
 I have compared my expenses to what I can expect to receive
from a reverse mortgage.
 I know what I want to do with my reverse mortgage payments.
 I have talked to my family about reverse mortgages and am
keeping them informed about my decisions.

f you think a reverse mortgage sounds like a good way to start
heading down a path of financial security, you’re ready to see if
you qualify. You can relax: The reverse mortgage is one of the easi-
est loans to qualify for in all the lending world. The basic require-
ments, which we explain in this chapter, to qualify for a reverse
mortgage are:
 You must be 62 years old or older.
 You must own your home.
 You must own a home that qualifies for the reverse mortgage
product you choose and live in it full time.
There are certain caveats of course, and lots of fine print, which
we expose in the next few pages. In this chapter you can compare
your individual living situation with the borrower requirements to
see if you’d be eligible for a reverse mortgage.
Finding Out If You Qualify
Almost anyone who meets the basic requirements can get a
reverse mortgage. You don’t need perfect credit, you don’t need a
down payment, and you don’t need a steady job. In fact, none of
those points matter in a reverse mortgage. 

Aging gracefully
Though you may feel discriminated against because of your age in
some facets of life, reverse mortgages were designed especially for
you. In order to receive a reverse mortgage you must be at least 62
years old. No exceptions. 
But wait, it gets even better. The older you are, the better you’ll 
do on a reverse mortgage. Why? Because lenders know that the
younger you are, the longer they’ll have to pay you. Lenders use
actuarial charts (just like insurance companies) to guess how long
you’ll be in your home. The charts aren’t a crystal ball, and they’re
not always right, but they give a pretty good estimation. Then
lenders calculate your loan based on your age, your home’s value,
and whatever the current interest rates are.
Look at Table 3-1 for an example of how your age can work for you
in a reverse mortgage. Let’s say our borrower, Nathaniel, owns a
home worth $235,000 in Jenkintown, PA, and owes no outstanding
mortgage debt. He’s choosing a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage
(HECM) reverse mortgage product and wants a lump sum, giving
him all his money in one big check. We’ll pretend for our purposes
that interest rates don’t change into the future (although in real
life, Nathaniel’s initial loan amount would be affected by rising and
falling rates). The table shows how much Nathaniel could expect
to borrow if he closed the loan at particular ages. Notice that the
older our fictitious borrower gets, the more money the lenders are
willing to loan him.

The typical age for reverse mortgage estimates is 75, because by
then you’re old enough to get a pretty hefty check but young
enough to be able to enjoy your new income. When you see exam-
ples of reverse mortgage calculations (in this book and in the
world at large) you’ll probably notice that the hypothetical bor-
rower is 75. It’s not a magic number, and by no means should it be
seen as any sort of limitation, but as far as the lenders go it’s the
perfect win-win age. 
There’s a disadvantage to this age system, however. If a couple,
ages 62 and 75, want to get a loan, you may think they should be
able to get a pretty good-sized check since 75 is just about the
ideal reverse mortgage age. But that’s not the case. For most
reverse mortgage loans, the age used to calculate the loan is that
of the youngest borrower (sneaky, isn’t it?). If Nathaniel (age 75)
and his youngest brother (age 62) want to live together to save
some money, their reverse mortgage will be calculated using his
brother’s age, which means a lower loan amount. On the other
hand, Nathaniel and his brother may find that they can get a larger
sum with a Fannie Mae Home Keeper loan (see Chapter 6) because
Fannie Mae uses a combination of borrower ages to determine the
available funds.
No matter what your age, if you are interested in getting a reverse
mortgage, find out what your options are from your originator (see
Chapter 9) and reverse mortgage counselor (see Chapter 8). It
can’t hurt to ask. 
Coupling
With divorce rates in America climbing higher and higher, it’s
amazing that there are any couples left at all. If you’re one of these
lucky couples, you can count yourselves among a growing trend.
Couples are increasingly among the seniors who are taking out
reverse mortgages. It used to be that reverse mortgages were largely
held by widowed women around age 76. Today, more and more
couples, and younger ones at that, are seeking reverse mortgages. 
There has also been an increase of couples who get a reverse mort-
gage when only one individual qualifies. It’s perfectly legal: One
person is age 62 or older and owns a home that’s covered under
the loan (see the section “Living Room: Eligible Homes,” later in
this chapter), and the other is a bit younger. To get the reverse
mortgage, however, the loan can only be for the eligible spouse —
that younger person will have to be removed from the title. And
when the qualified spouse dies or moves out for other reasons the
Chapter 3: Having the Right Stuff: Borrower Qualifications 41

younger will be responsible for paying back the loan in full. This
often means selling the home, and it may come at a time when that
resident isn’t ready to move (or just plain doesn’t want to). Most
counselors and originators will advise you against this, since this
situation can create serious financial stress at a time when the
remaining resident is probably stressed enough as it is. 
Regrettably, once the loan is closed (it’s in progress and you’re
receiving money) you may not add anyone to it. A change in the
borrowers would affect the loan, since it is based partially on your
age. The lenders will have figured the loan with the age of the only
eligible resident in mind. Adding another person would end the
loan and start a new one, meaning that whatever you’d borrowed
up to that point would be due at the time that a new loan was
issued. In cases where one spouse or other resident is much
younger and wouldn’t be eligible soon enough to benefit the older
person, a reverse mortgage may still work as long as everyone
involved knows the responsibility attached to the loan and has a
plan for repayment. 
The bottom line: Either wait for everyone on the title to become
eligible, or look for other options. 
Retaining Title
In order to qualify for a reverse mortgage you must own your
home. You don’t necessarily have to have it paid off completely,
but the less you owe, the more you can borrow. This is because the
reverse mortgage is based largely on equity — the value of your
home minus any debts. The money that you borrow is actually a
percentage of the equity in your home; the lenders are essentially
lending you a portion of the money you’d have if you sold your
home. What they don’t do is buy your home from you, nor do they
force you to hand it over to them when the loan is completed.
That’s a big misconception, and one that you should put out of
your mind right now. Repeat after us: A reverse mortgage doesn’t
mean the lender gets your house.
Many people operate under the misconception that a reverse mort-
gage means giving up the title to your home. In fact, the home’s
title remains in your name as long as you own it. If your name is
removed (for example, if you sold your home), the loan becomes
due and payable. What’s more, everyone who’s on the title must
meet the rest of the loan requirements. An adult child who helped
you purchase your home, for example, would have to be removed
before you obtained a reverse mortgage if he or she didn’t meet
the requirements.
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
42

Unfortunately, there are no provisions in reverse mortgages for
people who rent their residences, since the money you’re receiving
is based on equity — no ownership, no equity. If you live in a home
that you personally don’t own, we’re sorry to say that you won’t 
be eligible for a reverse mortgage. It’s a shame too, since many
people who rent would benefit enormously from the extra income.
Restrictions against renters also include people who rent-to-own,
since you technically don’t own the home yet. Seniors already
living in assisted living facilities won’t be able to get a loan either
unless the home or apartment is owned by the resident (you) and
falls under the housing guidelines (see the section “Living Room:
Eligible Homes,” later in this chapter).
Paying off your current mortgage
Many people think that you can’t owe anything on your current
mortgage in order to get a reverse mortgage. If that were the case,
it would seriously limit the number of people who could qualify,
and the reverse mortgage gurus know this. The fact is, you only
need to have some equity in your home to qualify. Of course, the
more of your home you own outright, the more money you’ll see
from a reverse mortgage since they’re loaning you a portion of
your existing equity. 
Financing your debt
Any outstanding mortgage will have to be paid off before you see
your first reverse mortgage payment. The upside is, you can roll
that pay-off into your loan amount to be paid off over time. You
never have to write that huge check to your last lender, and you
don’t have to take a big chunk out of your reverse mortgage funds
to pay it off all at once. 
Here’s how it works for Adam, a hypothetical borrower:
1. Adam and his originator fill out all his forms for the reverse
mortgage, noting that he still owes $35,000 on his previous
mortgage.
2. The lender figures out Adam’s total loan amount and agrees
to lend $129,000.
3. The $35,000 that Adam owes on his current mortgage is
subtracted from the $129,000 leaving Adam with a total of
$94,000 to do with as he pleases.
4. Adam lives happily ever after.
Chapter 3: Having the Right Stuff: Borrower Qualifications 43

Repaying before you borrow
For many people, the idea of giving up some of their loan in order
to pay off a current debt just won’t fly. If you don’t own your home
free and clear today, take a look at how much mortgage debt you
have. How many years will it take to pay down your existing loan?
You may not want to wait that long before reaping the potential
benefits of a reverse mortgage. By rolling your current loan into a
new reverse mortgage, you’ll also save money on future interest
payments, which can add up pretty fast. 
If you’re adamant about paying of your current mortgage before
seeking a reverse mortgage, you can speed up the process by
paying a little extra each month. Check with your current lender to
make sure there are no prepayment penalties first, and then start
sending as much as you’re comfortable with in addition to your
standard payments. Before you put the idea of a reverse mortgage
on the shelf while you repay your existing loan, talk with your
counselor or originator about your individual situation. You may
find that you’d have to wait longer than you’re comfortable with,
or that you can’t afford to send any extra payments. Just remem-
ber, if you start paying a higher monthly mortgage to repay your
original loan and then change your mind, whatever you’ve put into
it has increased your equity. Every little bit can make a difference. 
Generally speaking, you’re an okay candidate for a reverse mort-
gage if you’ve paid off about 65 to 75 percent of your home, a good
candidate if you’ve paid off 76 to 85 percent, and an excellent can-
didate if you’ve paid off 86 to 100 percent. These aren’t hard-and-
fast numbers, and they’ll vary with your age and value of your
home, but you get the idea. If you and your counselor play with the
numbers and can’t find a reverse mortgage solution that works for
you due to your outstanding debt, you may find that you have
other options. For a description of other loan or income choices
that a counselor may suggest, see Chapter 8.
Staying put
Once you get a reverse mortgage the assumption is that you are
going to live in your home. That’s why you would get a reverse
mortgage in the first place. To prove this reasoning, reverse mort-
gages prohibit you from moving out of your home for more than 
12 months at a time. This is how much the reverse mortgage lenders
want you to stay in your own home into your retirement: If you move
out for whatever reason, you end the loan and it must be repaid.
To take it one step further, even if you don’t sell the house — if you
still own it, but decide to rent it out to someone else and stay with
your family or live somewhere cheaper instead — your loan will be
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
44

due. This applies no matter what the situation is: If you move out
and rent it out to your sister, your son, your neighbor’s nephew, a
total stranger, whomever . . . your loan will end.
This is not to say that you’re never allowed to leave your home.
You can absolutely feel free to go on vacations, spend a few months
traveling, or (although not nearly as pleasant) spend some in-patient
time in the hospital. You are also free to move out of your home
when you need to, just as long as you understand that when you
do, you will have to pay back your loan. As we explain in detail in
Chapter 4, your lender will try to contact you about once a year to
make sure you’re still living in your home. Take these attempts
seriously and be sure to respond promptly.
It should stand to reason then, that you can’t sell your home either.
The loan is due when you don’t live at your home anymore, and
selling definitely qualifies under that restriction.
Living Room: Eligible Homes
If you’re over 62 and own your home, you’re over halfway to quali-
fying for a reverse mortgage. The next aspect of qualification is
your home. 
Most houses and units will qualify for reverse mortgages, but there
are some, such as the following, that will never pass muster:
 Mobile homes or trailers
 Motor homes
 House boats or yachts
 Multi-family properties with more than four units
 Manufactured homes built before 1976
 Timeshares
 Barns
 Impermanent structures (even if you own the land)
If you do own one of these home types, you are still entitled to talk
to a counselor about your options. While reverse mortgages may
not suit your unique living situation, other loan programs and
assistance opportunities may exist in your area.
If you live in virtually any other type of home, you can breathe a
sigh of relief. Your home will probably qualify.
Chapter 3: Having the Right Stuff: Borrower Qualifications 45

Why just “probably”? If your home needs extensive repairs that the
loan won’t be able to cover, isn’t up to code, or falls into one of
only a few ineligibility categories, you won’t be approved for the
loan. Your appraiser will assess your living situation and make
note of anything they see that would keep you from getting your
loan (for more on the appraisal, flip ahead to Chapter 10). This sec-
tion covers the types of homes that are eligible to qualify for a
reverse mortgage. There are a few reverse mortgage guidelines
that apply to any home type:
 Your house must be in relatively good condition. Each loan
program has its own set of standards, but a good rule of
thumb is to follow the FHA/HUD standards (available from
your counselor or originator). 
 Your home must be free or serious hazards like lead paint and
clear of any damaged plumbing, wiring, or structural elements.
Your reverse mortgage may be able to pay for repairs, but it
won’t pay for a whole-house renovation.
 You must live in your home full time. You can come and go as
you please, but if you’re gone for more than 12 months, your
loan may become due.
 If you own a rental property, you can move in and reap the
benefits of that built-up equity. It doesn’t matter how long you
lived there before, only that you live there as long as you have
your reverse mortgage.
Single-family homes
A single-family home is any home that is detached from other
dwellings. Does your home sit on a plot of land that you own, with
no other homes touching it? Then you probably live in a single-
family home. 
Single-family homes is the simplest category for loan purposes,
since there are very few rules about what kind of single-family
home is eligible. One-story, two-story, big, small, pool, no pool,
garage, no garage . . . as long as it stands alone, it counts. Unless
you built your home yourself and didn’t follow building standards,
you should be fine. Your home will need to meet Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) minimum property standards, which
are pretty straightforward (how wide your stairs must be, where
your utilities are located, and things like that). The rules are stan-
dard, and while your state or county may have specific housing
regulations, everyone has to adhere to HUD.

If your house touches someone else’s, you most likely live in a con-
dominium or a townhouse. The difference is that townhouses have
two stories within the unit, with no other home above or below it.
Loans may also lump planned unit developments (PUDs) and co-ops
into this category. They’re all basically the same idea: at least two
homes that share at least one wall. Most condos and townhouses
will qualify easily. Each loan product will have different rules gov-
erning what kind of condos and townhouses are allowed under
their terms. Skip ahead to Part II to read more about housing eligi-
bility for each loan option.
Some loans have rental limits. Many condo and townhouse devel-
opments welcome renters — but if your neighborhood allows more
than a certain percentage of rentals within the community (it dif-
fers depending on the loan program you choose), your home (even
though you’re not renting it out) may not qualify. Talk to your origi-
nator or counselor to find out if your home meets the rental
requirements.
In addition, your unit will have to pass the same safety tests as the
single-family homes. This isn’t to say your home has to be a pris-
tine, unlived-in museum, but it does have to be a safe place for you
to live.
Manufactured homes
Some manufactured homes aren’t eligible, but there’s a loophole. 
If your manufactured home was built after June 1976 and you own
Chapter 3: Having the Right Stuff: Borrower Qualifications 47
Heavy metal mamma
One thing you should be aware of is lead paint. Many people in older houses don’t
even realize that their walls are teeming with heavy metals. Lead paint has been
linked to several heath problems, ranging from such banal complaints as headaches
to much more serious issues, like cancer and nutrient malabsorption. If your home
was built prior to 1978 (when they stopped using lead paint) your appraiser will look
for signs of it. Simple tests can determine if the paint in your home is harmful and if
so, you may be required to fix the problem before they’ll give you a loan (or prom-
ise to fix it afterward). You’ll see a note about lead paint in your appraisal report, as
well as your loan application — that’s how serious it is. The lenders really want to
make sure you’re safe.

the land it’s permanently affixed to, your home may be eligible.
Manufactured homes are tricky business when it comes to any
type of loan — reverse or not — because they may not meet cer-
tain criteria, and more often than not they depreciate in value just
like your car.
Lenders are understandably wary to let you borrow against your
equity in a manufactured home, since that equity is usually either
static or declining. Historically, manufactured homes are a wonder-
ful choice for people who want to own a piece of the American
dream and stop paying rent to someone else, but they have never
been a stellar real estate investment. The upside is that if you
bought your manufactured home a decade ago, chances are that it
is worth slightly more today than it was then. But chances are
better that it hasn’t gained or lost value. Not a significant amount
anyway.
What lenders are afraid of is that the wear and tear on your manu-
factured home will render it less valuable than the day you get
your reverse mortgage. If they lend you $30,000 on a manufactured
home valued at $50,000 and it depreciates to $25,000 over the
years, they’ll never recoup their money. They’ll have lost $5,000
and that is something that big corporate lenders don’t like any
more than you do.
Generally speaking, only HECM (see Chapter 5) and Home Keeper
(see Chapter 6) will lend to borrowers who own manufactured
homes. They make up for the risk of depreciation by charging a
mortgage insurance premium (on an HECM) or simply loaning you
less money (on a Home Keeper). Since Financial Freedom (see
Chapter 7) has a $75,000 home value minimum (and isn’t ideal for
anyone with a house worth less than about a half million dollars)
they will rarely if ever lend money to a manufactured home owner.
Keep in mind that even the HECM and Home Keeper aren’t a sure
bet. Talk to your originator or counselor about your eligibility if
you live in a manufactured home. An always growing number of
seniors are finding that manufactured homes are an affordable way
to own a home and stay within their budgets. The reverse mort-
gage lenders are slowly starting to realize this and are very gradu-
ally accepting them for the legitimate houses that they are.
Multi-family homes
Multi-family homes are known by lots of different names; most
often they’re duplexes, triplexes, or fourplexes (don’t get us
started on the grammatical incongruousness of “fourplex”). For
those savvy real estate investors who purchased a multi-family res-
idence, don’t feel left out. As long as you live in one of the units full
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
48

time, your property may be eligible. What’s even better is that
there’s no rule as to how long you have to live at your residence
before you take out a reverse mortgage. If you’re thinking of getting
a reverse mortgage on a multi-family property that you use as an
income source, get packing and move into one of those units. Just
make sure it’s someplace you can see yourself living for several
years down the road.
Of course, “slum lords” need not apply. Your multi-family home must
be up to FHA/HUD standards in every way. Every unit must be safe
and sound, and every unit is subject to inspection. The only major
caveat to the multi-family home is that it can’t have more than four
units. The good news is that your entire property — every unit —
is calculated in the loan value. It wouldn’t make sense to treat it
like a condo since you own the whole place. Not every loan prod-
uct has multi-family homes under its mortgage umbrella, so talk to
your originator and counselor about your options.
Not to dissuade you from a reverse mortgage altogether, but if you
own a multi-family residence and you’re hurting for ready cash,
you may be better off either selling the property or raising the rent
on the other units — just make sure you’re asking a fair and rea-
sonable rent (fair for you and the tenant). 
Reverse mortgages are designed to last about seven years on 
average. Will you still want to be responsible for those other units
in seven years or more? Of course, you’re free to end your loan 
by selling your home at any time, but selling too early can make
your loan more expensive in the long run. Or short run, as the 
case may be. 
Second homes
Reverse mortgages only allow you to take out a loan on one home
at a time, but they don’t say anything about how many homes you
can own. In fact, your second home may be the perfect solution to
the question of where you’ll go if you decide to move out of your
home and end your loan. 
Remember that you must live in your home full time to be eligible.
For those lucky ducks who have two or more homes to spend their
time in, you can still get a reverse mortgage . . . but only on one of
your homes. Most people who own a second home have it for a
getaway and don’t spend their time equally in both homes. One
house is a primary residence and the other is secondary. It’s your
primary residence exclusively that can have a reverse mortgage
lien on it. You may have to choose which house you want to use
the reverse mortgage for if you use each one for half the year. 
Chapter 3: Having the Right Stuff: Borrower Qualifications 49

The decision can be as easy as choosing the one with the higher
value, or the one with the best weather. Either way, the one you
choose will be your primary residence for the next few years. 
Whether it appears clear which home you actually live in, or you
do truly spend your time exactly equally between homes, the origi-
nator and lender will base their loan assessment on the address
found on your driver’s license or other legal identification. Since
no one can hold more than one valid driver’s license or other simi-
lar identification, it will become clear very quickly which house
you actually call home. If you want to use what was your second-
ary home as a retirement residence and get the reverse mortgage
on that property, you’ll need to update your identification (it’s
easy, just call your department of motor vehicles).
Of course, just because you named one house as a primary resi-
dence doesn’t mean you have to abandon the other. What’s the 
use of getting that extra cash if you can’t use it to travel to your
favorite destination? Remember, you can’t be away from your pri-
mary home for more than 12 months at a time. Lenders figure that
if you can stay away for that long, it probably isn’t your primary
residence. 
You know that you can only have a reverse mortgage on one of your
homes, so you must choose which one to mortgage. But if you
think you and your spouse can each take your name off of one of
the home’s titles and both get reverse mortgages on separate
houses, thereby doubling your income, don’t. It’s illegal, and you
don’t want to spend your golden years in the slammer, do you?

Chapter 4
Repaying Your Loan 
In This Chapter
 Figuring out repayment
 Finding a repayment option that suits your situation
You’ve probably been paying a lender every month for your
traditional “forward” mortgage for the past 40 years. As you
paid, your balance went down while your equity (the amount of
money you would get from the sale of your home after all mortgage
debts are repaid) went up. Your reverse mortgage is just the oppo-
site: It pays you every month (or however you choose to receive
your money) and increases your loan balance as your equity goes
down. It sounds like the perfect plan: Live in your house, get
money instead of paying it, never have to worry about a mortgage
repayment. Well, almost never. There comes in life an end to all
things, and your reverse mortgage is no exception. In this chapter
we tell you how you repay your loan and when that repayment is
due. We also give you some tips on how you and your family can
prepare for that day before the time comes.
Getting the Loan Repaid
We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: The reverse mortgage is
not free money. When you take out a reverse mortgage, you are
essentially borrowing ahead of time the money you’d get if you had
sold your home, without actually having to sell it. The key word is
borrowing. They hand you a portion of what your home is worth
today, and you agree to pay it back at a later date. It’s not a gift; it’s
a loan. In addition to repaying the portion of equity you’ve bor-
rowed, you’ll also pay a few thousand dollars in fees, plus interest.
No matter which reverse mortgage product you choose, your loan
will have to be paid off sooner or later — luckily, it’s usually later. 

The idea of repaying a loan that came out of the equity in your
home may seem a little confusing at first for you and for your
family, but the facts are actually pretty straightforward. 
Figuring out when it’s due 
and who has to pay it
Any reverse mortgage becomes due and payable when you meet
any of these circumstances:
 You permanently move out of your home. If the mortgage
comes due because you’ve decided to move out, you will be
responsible for paying back the loan at that time and will have
to wade through the repayment process. In cases where
you’re being moved to assisted living, it’s common for a
durable power of attorney to take over and worry about this
matter for you.
You can only have a reverse mortgage on one home at a time.
Seniors who have two homes (for instance, a summer home
and a winter home, or a cabin by the lake) will have to choose
one as their permanent residence for reverse mortgage pur-
poses. You can, of course, still spend your winters at your
second home in Tahiti or summer in Cape Cod, but if you
choose to retire to the one that you have not claimed as your
primary residence, your loan will come due.
 The last borrower dies. If the loan is due because the last sur-
viving borrower has died, the responsibility of payment falls
to your heirs (or whomever you’ve named in a trust or will).
They have several options available to them that are covered
further in this chapter, and in more detail in Chapter 13.
 You fail to pay property taxes, fall behind on home owners
insurance payments, and/or maintain the home (although
this rarely happens). You will also be held accountable for
repayment if you neglect your home. This isn’t a subjective
matter, where one person thinks your creaky staircase is
unacceptable and another would let it slide. These are serious
problems, like a hole in your roof or a backed-up sewer line.
This requirement also includes keeping up with your property
taxes and insurance, which are necessities for any homeowner.
When two or more borrowers exist on a loan and one has to move
out (for assisted living or personal reasons, for example) the loan
will not need to be repaid. Only when the last borrower perma-
nently leaves the house will the loan come due. 
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
52

When your loan is due, the whole entire kit and caboodle must be
paid at once. There are no installment plans, so you (or your heirs)
need to have a plan in place for paying the loan back in full. This is
why many people choose to sell their homes — you’ll easily earn
enough on the sale to pay the balance, and may have some left
over to do with what you wish. 
Contacting the lender
If your lender estimates that you’ll keep your loan for 10 years and
makes payments to you reflecting that timeframe, you may think
you have to start paying back the loan after 10 years. In fact, as
long as you continue to pay your property taxes and keep up the
home in good condition the lender can never demand payment
from you until you no longer live at that address.
Many seniors wonder how the lender will know when the last bor-
rower has moved out or died — it’s not as if they peer through
your hedges at you, or check the resident lists at the hot new
retirement communities for your name. Technically speaking, it is
your responsibility to let the lender or servicer know that you’ve
left your home for good. Obviously if the loan has become payable
upon your death, it may be a little tricky for you to alert them. It’s
a good idea to let your family know that part of settling your estate
includes letting the lender in on your passing, but often family
members are too consumed by your absence that they let it slip by
the wayside. The same is often true if you are moved to assisted
living or another facility and aren’t in a state of mind to alert the
lender. This doesn’t mean that you can unintentionally get away
with never repaying your loan. They’ll find out sooner or later that
you are no longer at home.
In fact, the servicer of the loan has the responsibility of making
sure that the owner is still occupying the property. Are they hiding
in that unmarked van outside your house all day just to be sure?
No, believe it or not they thought of a much easier way. The serv-
icer will send you a letter, or call once per year just to say “hi.” A
letter will request a response (probably a note to sign or a short
form to fill out) asking you to verify that you do, indeed, still live in
your home. Simply fill it out and send it back. They even come in
pre-addressed envelopes more often than not, so the effort is very
minimal.
If you don’t answer the letter, or the person who answers the phone
reports that no one with your name lives there, the servicer will
probably try to reach you by another method just to be sure (if
they called, they may try a letter the next time or vice versa).
Chapter 4: Repaying Your Loan 53

Servicers don’t want to be too hasty, just in case your letter was
lost in the mail, or your grandchild picked up the phone and didn’t
know that your name isn’t Grandpa.
In cases where the servicer still can’t reach you, the next step is to
follow up with a call or letter to your alternative contact. When you
fill out the pile of forms needed to apply for the loan, one of these
will be an alternative contact form, on which your lender will ask
for an alternative contact person who they can reach for just such
an occasion. This should be someone stable, who you know well,
and who isn’t likely to move in the next few years (if they do, make
sure you let the originator and/or servicer know). Alternative con-
tacts are usually family members, friends, or neighbors, but they
could also be attorneys or other professionals (just be sure you get
their permission first). 
If you get a letter or call from the servicer, return it right away!
Otherwise, they’ll start to assume the worst.
Settling your tab
You’ve seen a lot of varying numbers up to this point — value of
home, value of loan, loan balance, interest rates, servicing fees,
and more — and each loan has a different formula for calculating
each facet of the loan. So how will you know how much you owe?
The quick answer is: Your lender will send you a bill. In fact, you
can estimate what you’ll owe based on the statements your ser-
vicer will send you on a regular basis (usually monthly or quar-
terly). To get the total figure, your lender and servicer total five
main elements: 
 Principal loan amount: The principal is the total base amount
that the lenders have established for you to borrow. They
guess how long they expect you to stay in your home and
come up with a reasonable dollar amount for your available
funds. This is a clean, unaffected number, a foundation on
which the rest of your loan costs grow.
Once the lenders determine that amount, they simply have to
keep paying you if you’ve chosen a monthly tenure payout, no
matter how long you decide to stay in your house over and
above the number of years they guessed. A possible downside
to this otherwise positive benefit is that your loan balance
(what you owe) will increase as the lender adds monthly 
payouts to your tab beyond the original estimated total loan
amount.
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
54

 Accrued interest: Each loan product has its own way of creat-
ing the interest rate for that particular loan. That rate is multi-
plied by your loan balance each term (the length of time it
takes for your rate to change — we give you details on when
the change occurs for each loan in Chapters 5, 6, and 7), and
that amount is added to your total due. Each term until the
day the loan comes due, interest will continue to be added to
the total amount you have borrowed up to that point.
 Origination fees: Your originator charges you a fee based on
the particular loan type’s allowances (see Chapters 5, 6, and 7
for details on each loan type’s origination fees).
 Closing costs: Your closing costs cover things like your
appraiser, flood inspection, and other additional tasks. (See
Chapters 5, 6, and 7 for details on each loan type’s closing
costs.)
 Servicing fees: The servicing fee is also controlled by the
type of loan and pays the servicer monthly to cut you a check
and to generally make sure everything is still running
smoothly with your loan. (See Chapters 5, 6, and 7 for details
on each loan type’s servicing fees.)
Your origination and servicing fees, plus closing costs, are
bundled up into your loan balance and charged interest as well.
If you can afford it, you may as well pay these costs up-front
(before you start receiving money) since the interest will have
you owing much more for them in the long run.
The total loan balance is the culmination of all the above factors. If
at any time you have questions about what you owe or are confused
about the statement your servicer sends, call them or your origina-
tor and ask. Most people have questions about their statements at
some point, and your servicer or originator will be happy to help
you sort it out.
How much your personal loan will finally come out to is really
anyone’s guess. Unless you have a definitive timeframe in mind
(seven years in this house and then off to assisted living, for exam-
ple) there’s no way to know when the loan will come due or what
the loan balance will be until it actually ends. 
Sometimes your home will have decreased in value over the years,
and the loan balance will come out to more than you could ever
hope to sell your home for. If your loan balance comes to $100,000
and your home is only worth $70,000, don’t fret. In these cases,
you can never owe more than your home is worth. What happens
to that $30,000 difference? The lender simply has to absorb it.
Chapter 4: Repaying Your Loan 55

They will never foreclose or force you out of your home. That’s
part of the beauty of the reverse mortgage . . . even the idea of
losing your home is reversed!
Understanding the TALC
If you feel a little wary of getting a loan for an unknown amount,
there’s a silver-plated lining. Your originator is required to give you
a Total Annual Loan Cost (TALC) estimate before you sign on the
dotted line. It takes a stab at calculating, on average, how much
your loan will cost you per year. Of course, you don’t actually pay
anything until your loan comes due, this just helps estimate what
you’ll pay at the end of the loan: the yearly cost multiplied by how-
ever many years you live in the home.
Although a TALC disclosure is designed to give you a pretty accu-
rate look at what you can expect to pay each year for the life of the
loan, it can be very misleading. Here’s why:
 The TALC disclosure’s estimation includes all prorated closing
costs and other fees, under the circumstance that you take half
your money as a line of credit and then don’t touch the rest.
However, nearly no one would choose that payment option.
 The TALC isn’t a crystal ball — it can’t tell you how long you’ll
live in your home or what will happen to home values in that
time, so it’s really just a guessing tool. 
 The TALC designers forgot to figure in changing interest rates,
monthly payments versus credit lines, how much you’ll want
to withdraw, and growing credit lines. 
Two seemingly identical loans could end up costing a lot more (or
a lot less) if even one of the above variables change, but the TALC
would suppose that they would have the same yearly costs.
Although the TALC misses out on a lot of factors, don’t discount it
altogether. You can use it loosely as a tool to plan ahead, especially
if you mean to move within a certain timeframe, or plan to follow
the TALC assumptions of only using half of your line of credit.

56

Knowing When to 
Repay Your Loan
You need to be comfortable with the amount of money that will
eventually have to be repaid to the lender and confident that the
costs involved are worth the benefits of the loan. How you pay for
it is up to you, as well as when you choose to end the loan. 
Try to decide before you obtain a reverse mortgage which of these
methods you want to use to pay off the loan. Use the section below
to decide and plan ahead so you can save yourself a lot of headaches
later.
Paying as you go
Borrowers who opted for a line of credit or lump sum usually have
the option to repay the loan “as they go.” (See Chapters 5, 6, and 7
for more on lines of credit and lump sum options for each loan
type.) This type of loan that can be paid back as you go is called a
revolving or “open” credit line. You can keep paying and borrowing
the same money over and over — for instance, if you withdrawal
$1,000, you can pay it back the next month and then have that
$1,000 available again to withdraw. Thus it revolves back and forth
from the bank to you. However, if you choose to pay back your
mortgage throughout the life of the loan without withdrawing that
money again, you’ll save yourself (and your heirs) from having to
repay that money later.
Although two of the Financial Freedom options (see Chapter 7)
don’t allow this for the first five years, you are free to pay any
amount back you choose at any time after that point (up to the
total principal). But be careful . . . some loans don’t allow you to
repay the full amount, or if they do allow it they consider the loan
ended at that point, which means you can’t borrow any more
money. (See Chapters 5, 6, and 7 for more specifics on each loan.)
You may enjoy these benefits to paying as you go:
Chapter 4: Repaying Your Loan 57

 Lowering your loan balance also lowers the amount that is
charged interest. You will only pay interest on money that
has been borrowed and not yet repaid. If you have borrowed
$20,000 and pay back $5,000, you will only be charged interest
on $15,000 from that point forward. Every time you send in
another repayment, your loan balance goes down and you’re
charged interest on less and less of your loan. 
 You can lower your final payable loan amount. If your loan
closes due to your death, your heirs will thank you for having
the foresight to reduce their inherited debt. In fact, some fami-
lies work out a system of repayment in which the heirs help
pay back the loan as you go so they aren’t faced with a large
debt when you’re gone. They may contribute $50 or $100 per
month (or whatever they can afford) toward the loan balance.
In families with several heirs, the burden can be distributed
among all of them, allowing the loan to be paid back faster.
Paying as you go isn’t an option for everyone — lots of people
need every last penny of their payment during the life of their
loan — but if you have some money left over at the end of the
month, you can deposit it back into your available funds to
lower the costs at the end of the loan. If you’re on a line of
credit and take out $800 to buy a new dress for your daugh-
ter’s wedding, but only end up spending $600, put that remain-
ing amount back in your account. Think about how much
more money we all tend to spend if we have cash in our
pocket versus money in our savings account — replace unused
funds instead of keeping it at your quick disposal, and you’ll
save more than you expect in the long run.
If you have the means to pay back a little as you go, and your loan
allows it, this could be a good start toward paying off your reverse
mortgage.
Moving out
If you’ve chosen to move out of your home for any reason (for
instance, relocating to a retirement home, moving into an assisted
living facility, or living with a friend or family member) your loan
will become due and payable. Selling your home when you move
out is the easiest option and the most popular choice for repayment.
A reverse mortgage doesn’t mean that the lender owns your home,
or that you automatically lose it at the end of your loan. You still
hold the title to your home, and selling it to repay the loan is just
one option.
Part I: Understanding the Basics of a Reverse Mortgage 
58

Here are the benefits to selling your home:
 You won’t ever have to take money out of your pocket to
pay for the loan. Even if your home value drops below the
total loan balance, you will never owe more than the value of
your home. For instance, if your loan and total fees, including
interest, total $83,000 but your house sells for only $75,000,
the lender will absorb the difference.
 You may have money after the sale to pocket even after the
loan is paid. If your home is worth $300,000 at the time the
loan ends and your loan came out to a balance of $132,000,
you or your heirs could sell the home, pay off the debt, and be
left with $168,000 in your pockets. For that much money, you
can probably buy your retirement condo debt free! It’s also a
nice gift to leave to your family — who couldn’t use that kind
of money? 
You may be especially wary of selling your home if it has a special
sentimental value. Maybe a family member built it by hand, or it’s
the home your children were all raised in. If you know for certain
that someone in your family will want to live in your house after
you’ve moved out, then by all means, don’t sell. Or better yet, sell
it to that person. Your heirs should be thrilled to be able to pur-
chase your home, and you’ll love being able to see them enjoy it
while you’re still around. Talk to your heirs about this early on, so
you don’t have to make a snap decision later.
In most cases, you won’t need to hang onto a second home,
although it’s perfectly natural to want to keep it around in case 
you don’t like your new location . . . natural, but not a smart move
financially. Why pay off a loan from your own savings, plus the new
mortgage or rent, when you can take care of it all by selling? Selling
your home is a decision only you and your family or financial advi-
sor can make, but it is by far the simplest way to pay back your loan. 
Selling your home may be a good choice for you if you are going to
move out anyway (whether you are buying a new home, going into
assisted living, or moving in with family) or have exhausted your
reverse mortgage funds and need to find a new source of income.
The loan is easily repaid and you may even be left with extra
money from the sale! 
Moving on
The other common way for a reverse mortgage loan to become due
and payable is when the last borrower on the loan dies. This is a
Chapter 4: Repaying Your Loan 59

topic that many people prefer to avoid, as the prospect of planning
one’s own death can seem a bit too macabre. Many times the bor-
rower is fine with the idea, but their children are uncomfortable
thinking about their parent’s eventual death. The key is to deal
with your family in a sensitive manner, and regardless of their
protests, make them understand that they need to know how to
repay your loan.
Preparing your family for repayment of the loan is critical because
there are no provisions to pay the loan back in installments.
Technically, it won’t be you personally who has to worry about
repaying the loan, so you need to be sure that your family knows
what is expected of them, how to pay off the loan, and how you
want your remaining money spent. Your heirs have several options
for paying back the loan:
 The heirs can pay back the loan with their own cash. Keep
in mind, however, that your family may not have enough
ready cash available to pay the loan in full, so the other
options listed below are likely more realistic.
 The heirs can sell the home. If they don’t have a sentimental
attachment to your home, most family members will choose
to sell the home. It will repay the loan, and they can keep any
money left over from the sale (be sure to give instructions for
that possibility in your will).
 You can leave part of your estate (your other valuables,
money, and investments) to pay off the loan upon your
death. Just as you would for any other financial arrangements
post mortem, make sure that your wishes are clearly defined
to your family. If you have enough assets and your family
doesn’t wish to sell the home, this can be a nice alternative.
 The heirs can take out a forward loan (a regular mortgage)
on the house to pay the lender immediately and then rent
out your former home to help cushion the costs. Your family
can cash in on renters until they’re ready to use your home
for their own personal purposes.
Your heirs are not selling your home to the lender. They’re selling
it to the next family member who wants to live there, and then
using all or a portion of the proceeds from that sale to pay back
the loan.
Note that the loan is payable when the last borrower is gone, not
the last resident. This is why it can be so important that anyone
living in the home is named on the loan. Obviously, this doesn’t
include people who don’t qualify, but if a couple aged 64 and 56 are

looking into a reverse mortgage, it would serve them well to wait at
least six years (until the younger person is 62) before taking out a
loan. 
There is a certain appeal to gettin’ while the gettin’ is good and
signing off on a loan as soon as someone in the home turns 62, but
this can be dangerous to the younger borrower if something should
happen to their elder housemate. For example, if the older bor-
rower dies before the younger borrower, the surviving resident can
be responsible for paying back the entire balance. If that person
wants to stay in their home, they’ll have to take out a whole new
loan to pay for the reverse mortgage or hope that there is enough
money saved up to pay it out-of-pocket. This can also be trouble-
some if the sole borrower has left the home to other heirs, because
they may wish to sell the home to pay off the debt, leaving the
remaining resident displaced.
Chapter 4: Repaying Your Loan 61
Planning ahead for your assets
Although it doesn’t happen too frequently, some borrowers die leaving no heirs
whatsoever (it’s rare because lost relatives almost surely show up when they hear
that they may be the recipients of your money). In this case, the lender would get
the title to your home, and after they are repaid, the state you live in would take over
and handle the settlement of your estate. 
What would the state want with your estate? Why, to sell it of course. Once they’ve
put your house on the market and sold off all of your worldly possessions in order
to pay back the loan, any leftover equity (money from those sales) will also be man-
aged by the state. That leftover balance could potentially be quite large, depending
on home prices and the value of your loan. 
In the event that the opposite has occurred — your home value has turned out to
be much less than the value of the loan — the lender or servicer has the right to
step in and sell the property. This is the only time when a lender or servicer would
have this right!
This is why you must have a plan for your assets after you die. Whether you want
your money to go to the Louvre’s restoration fund, public radio, or the National Kitten
Appreciation Club, you need to have your wishes in writing for exactly the reasons
mentioned above. Otherwise, your estate will be used as the state sees fit. While the
state may use your estate for noble causes (paving roads, paying county clerks,
buying pads of tickets for traffic cops), you will have no say in what your money is
used for. This is why you must specify your wishes in a will.
In your will, you can elect any organization, charitable or otherwise, to receive any
leftover money after your reverse mortgage has been repaid. You worked hard for

your estate, no matter what size it is, so make sure it goes to someone who can
really appreciate it. 
You should know by this point that the lender or servicer never has rights to your
home as long as you hold the title (which is always until you personally give it up
under your own wishes, or die, leaving the title to someone else). But, if you should
die and leave no heirs, the title will go to the lender or servicer, since it’s their loan
that needs to be repaid. Just remember — how you pay your loan is your decision,
but it will always help to plan ahead and make your wishes known.

I
n 1989, when most people were exercising with Richard Simmons
and donning extra-puffy shoulder pads, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was busy creating the
Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), America’s first widely
accepted reverse mortgage. Although there had been prior attempts
at developing other “reverse flow” loans, they were costly, unin-
sured, and left little to be desired for the hundreds of thousands of
seniors who could have really used them. Luckily for you, HUD
stepped up and worked with the United States Congress to estab-
lish the HECM (you may hear your originator or counselor refer to
this as the “heck-um”). This chapter explains the HECM loan, what
the qualifications and lending limits are, how your interest rate
affects your loan, how mortgage insurance can protect your invest-
ment, and how you can receive your payments. 
Getting to Know the HECM
Up until now, you may have only imagined the Federal Housing
Administration (FHA) as a far-away entity that regulates low-
income housing and mortgage rates. In fact, the FHA (which is a

division of HUD) oversees all aspects of housing in the country and
is designed to protect you, the homeowner. When HUD and
Congress developed the HECM, their goal was to help people over
62 live comfortably without the fear of going broke from medical
bills, not to mention an economy that encourages inflation rates
that escalate faster than most people’s pensions and retirement
funds can grow.
The FHA insures HECM loans, which means that your loan is feder-
ally insured. If your originator suddenly goes out of business or
your home loses value, it’s the FHA to the rescue. Just imagine a
government agency where they all wear red spandex and flowing
capes, but instead of being able to leap tall buildings in a single
bound, they protect your mortgage.
HECM loans are the most popular in the country — they’re avail-
able in every state (plus Puerto Rico) and have “set the bar” for all
other reverse mortgage products. In fact the other two reverse
mortgage options we will discuss in Chapters 5 and 6 are modeled
on this trendsetter. According to most sources, up to 95 percent of
all reverse mortgages are HECMs. It’s true that they are the most
widely publicized, but people like them because they usually offer
more cash in your pocket. In fact, many forward mortgage origina-
tors are only familiar with the HECM loan (which is another good
reason to work with an approved reverse mortgage originator).
As in all reverse mortgage products, your HECM loan does not
come due until you leave the home permanently. You will never be
foreclosed on, and they will never ask for payments before you
move out or die — all you have to do in return is pay your prop-
erty taxes and homeowner’s insurance, and keep up the mainte-
nance on your home (things you should be doing already). In fact,
if you live in the home longer than the lender originally guessed
you would, they must keep paying you the same amount until you
leave the home. If you ever needed a good reason to take better
care of yourself, this is it: The longer you can stay in your home,
the more money they’ll lend you (when you choose the monthly
payments; see more on this later in this chapter in “Receiving
monthly payments”).
Meeting HECM Requirements
Each reverse mortgage product has its own idiosyncrasies that
make it unique. While all reverse mortgages have the same basic
eligibility requirements, the HECM has some additional points to
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
66

consider, such as disbursement options (how you get paid), addi-
tional costs, meeting with a HUD-approved counselor, and lending
limits. 
There are, however, some common traits among all reverse mort-
gages. As a reverse mortgage borrower, you must:
 Be at least 62 years old (see Chapter 3)
 Be a homeowner with at least some equity in your home
(preferably all or mostly paid off) (see Chapter 3)
 Live in your home full time (see Chapter 3)
 Own a home that qualifies (see Chapter 3)
Anyone in a household who is listed as a homeowner on the title is
eligible for an HECM loan as long as that person meets the require-
ments listed above. However, the FHA will calculate your loan based
on the youngest homeowner. It could be worth about $5,000 to you
to wait a few years before getting your loan, because in most situa-
tions, the older you are, the more money you’ll be able to borrow
(if interest rates are extraordinarily high, this may not be the case).
If your spouse or any other resident is too young to qualify you can
still get a reverse mortgage in your name only, but there are conse-
quences. When you die or move out for any reason, your loan will
be due and the person remaining in the home may be responsible
for your debts. Talk to your counselor about the ramifications of
getting a loan too early (see Chapter 8).
Standard reverse mortgage housing requirements (see Chapter 3)
apply to the HECM, with one minor exception: If you live in a con-
dominium, it must be FHA approved. Talk to your counselor
(Chapter 8) to be sure that your home qualifies. 
Checking out lending limits
The HECM is a great loan — don’t get us wrong — but if you own a
home with a higher value than the national average, this may not
be the loan for you. While they cover a wide array of home types,
HECM mortgages have the lowest lending limits of all the reverse
mortgage options. The upside is you can still get more cash out 
of an HECM loan than the other major products. Lending limits
(called “203-b” limits, because that’s where they’re found in the
National Housing Act) are based on HUD’s statistics regarding aver-
age sales prices in various counties.
For your personal lending limits there are three main variables: 
Chapter 5: The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage 67

 your age — or the age of the youngest homeowner
 the value of your home
 current interest rates.
We discuss these variables in the sections that follow.
Factoring in your age
Just like when you bought your life insurance policy, an actuarial
table will be used to guess how long you’ll live and, in this case,
how long you’ll live in your home. The lender will determine your
loan partly based on this information. The good news is, HECMs
typically have very generous actuarial tables. They also only base
your life/home expectancy on your current age, nothing else. You
could be a professional sword swallower and they’d estimate your
lifespan with the same table as they would an avid knitter if your
ages were the same.
Under an HECM, a married couple would get the same amount of
money as a single person because they base your household’s pay-
ments on the youngest borrower. Other loans, like the Fannie Mae
Home Keeper, give less money to a married couple because studies
show that married people live longer, and the longer they think
you’re going to live, the less money they’ll lend to you.

Getting ahead of the game
For a calculator that will give you a ballpark estimate of how much you can borrow,
visit the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association’s Web site at www.
reversemortgage.org and click on “Reverse Mortgage Calculator.” Simply enter
your age, home value, and any outstanding debts you have, and they’ll tell you how
much you can expect. At the bottom of the estimates page, click “Loan Summary”
to find out how they came up with your loan amount. This is a great way to get famil-
iar with typical loan amounts and the math that’s involved. When your originator fig-
ures your total loan amount, he or she will be looking at a screen that’s similar to the
one you’ll see here. You may want to print this page to take with you when you see
your counselor, who can give you an idea of how close this computer-generated
loan is to reality.

Taking into account 
your home’s value
The area you live in affects the value of your home and will also
affect the lending maximums in your county. Consider housing
prices in your town. A three-bedroom, 2,500 square-foot home in
Topeka won’t generate as much equity as the same house in
Miami, because cost of living in different areas pushes housing
prices up or down. FHA has set specific lending limits in relation to
defined counties — they realize that two identical homes with
identical borrowers would have different values in different areas
and capped lending limits accordingly. 
When you apply for any reverse mortgage, an appraiser will visit to
determine you home’s value (see Chapter 10) but for now, don’t
worry too much about the actual value of your home. Instead,
think about housing prices in your area. Are they unusually high?
Low? Just right? Rural neighborhoods and smaller towns typically
have a lower cost of living (and therefore lower average home
values) and fetch a lower lending limit, just as homes in urban
areas often carry a much higher selling price and thus higher lend-
ing limits. For example, Los Angeles County will have higher lend-
ing limits than Southern Arizona’s Pima County because housing
prices in Los Angeles are so much higher.
It sounds like an oxymoron, but HECM loans have set a low maxi-
mum lending limit, as well as a high maximum lending limit. Low
maximums are for lower-home-value areas and higher maximums
are for higher-home-value areas. There are also countless lending
maximums in between for different costs-of-living in counties
nationwide. Though it changes every year, the 2005 low maximum
was $172,632. If you live in a higher-cost urban area, your ceiling
for 2005 would’ve been $312,896.These figures aren’t pulled arbi-
trarily from the air. They’re based on home value averages across
the country. HECM lending limits may or may not be close to your
actual home value, but they should be in the ballpark of your
county’s average. Ask your originator (Chapter 9) what your
county’s lending limits and county housing price averages are.
The maximum does not mean that only people within those lend-
ing limits can get an HECM loan. All it means is that regardless of
the actual value of your home, the FHA will never loan you more
than that maximum. But (and this is a big “but” so pay attention)
Chapter 5: The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage 69

you will almost always get more cash from an HECM if your home
value is near your county’s average home value. If your home value
falls within about $100,000 of the maximum lending limit, you should
seriously consider the HECM loan. If you’re looking at these figures
and thinking “My next-door neighbor’s house just sold for five
times that!” skip ahead to Chapter 7, to read about Jumbo Cash
Accounts.
The FHA always calculates your loan amount on the lesser of either
your home value or the FHA maximum. Therefore, in a high-cost
area in 2004, the most you could ever borrow is $312,896, even if
your home is worth $300,000. If your home is worth $150,000, they
would base your loan amount on the home value because it is less
than the FHA maximum. 
Your originator will also let you know what the current HECM lend-
ing limits are when you begin the loan process. Because limits vary
from county to county, check the HUD Web site’s maximum lists for
the most up-to-date information in your area (https://entp.hud.gov/
idapp/html/hicostlook.cfm). Don’t worry about your originator
giving you a lower loan limit than you think you deserve. FHA gives
them a free software program that calculates your particular loan
amount automatically. The originator actually has very little to do
with the amount you can receive. 
Checking out current interest rates
Another factor in determining your loan amount (aside from your
age and home value) are current interest rates. As interest rates go
up and down, the amount you can borrow will change, just as it
would in a forward mortgage. When you sign off on your mortgage
(Chapter 11) the interest rate at that moment will be figured into
the equation that determines your loan amount. The lower the
interest rate, the more you’ll be able to borrow. 
Understanding ARM rates and margins
HECM interest rates are adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), and it’s
up to you to decide which type of ARM you want. An ARM means
that the interest rate changes regularly — either every month or
every year. Usually it only changes by a fraction of a percentage
point at a time. It may go from 4.27 to 4.60 percent, nothing that
you’d really even notice. It’s the change over time that really
impacts your loan. Let’s say that on the day you get your reverse
mortgage, interest rates are at 4.25 percent and your total loan
amount is $90,000. If your rate stayed the same over the entire
course of your loan, you’d eventually pay 4.25 percent for every
year that you had the loan. With an ARM, your rate could jump up
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
70

to 10 percent at some point down the road, and until it changes
(for better or for worse) that’s the rate you’ll be charged. Every
mortgage will charge you interest; if you’re comfortable with rates
that fluctuate in exchange for generally lower rates than you could
get with a forward mortgage, an HECM may be right for you.
Interest is added to your principal loan amount — the amount the
lender will actually let you borrow. When you get a loan for $50,000
you need to remember that when your loan comes due you can’t
just hand over a check for $50,000; there will be interest added that
could amount to several thousand dollars. While the interest rate
won’t affect your payouts, it does affect how much the lender will
initially calculate for your total loan amount, and how much you’ll
pay at the end. Pay attention to interest rates if you like, but don’t
let them stress you out. You probably won’t even think of them
again after you close your loan. 
The interest rates for an HECM are based on the one-year U.S.
Treasury Securities rate, a percentage figure that changes weekly.
Originators add that one-year Treasury Security rate to a margin to
get your interest rate. The rate margin is just a fancy way to say
“how much we can tack onto your rate.” The FHA puts these margin
limits in place to keep originators from charging ridiculously high
rates, or ridiculously low ones . . . it forces everyone to play fair.
The higher the margin, the less cash for you. The lower the margin,
the more cash for you. Remember, the rate doesn’t change your
payments, but it does affect how much you can borrow at the
outset.
When you speak to your originator, you will be given the choice of
a monthly or yearly ARM.
Betting on the monthly ARM
The monthly ARM is by far the most popular, because it usually
gives you more cash in your pocket up-front and a lower interest
rate. For example, when the annual is at 5.60 percent, the monthly
is probably at around 4.00 percent. The monthly ARM tends to be
much lower than the yearly because it changes so often, but it has
the potential to rise faster than a yearly ARM — you’re assuming
the risk of higher rates over time in exchange for a lower initial rate. 
Here’s the really good news: The monthly ARM can never (ever, no
matter what) go up more than 10 percent over the entire life of the
loan. Remember in the late 1980s and early ’90s when interest rates
were at nearly 15 percent? If you had gotten an HECM loan then
(you would have been one of the first!) and your originator locked
in an initial monthly rate of 3.20 percent, no matter how high the
rates went for the rest of the country, yours would never have
Chapter 5: The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage 71

gone up more than 13.20 percent. Even if you kept the loan for 15
years and rates miraculously skyrocketed every year that you had
the loan, you’d still come out ahead. And quite frankly, the chances
of another rate hike like the one back then aren’t likely. We heard a
lot about “historically low rates” in the early 2000s, but in reality,
those rates were more in keeping with the average. People had just
become accustomed to high rates.
It’s also good to keep in mind that what goes up must come down.
Even if rates shoot up in the first couple of years after you get your
HECM, they will almost invariably go down and even out through-
out the life of the loan.
Advantages to a monthly ARM include:
 You get a lower margin, which usually means a lower rate.
 Your rate will never go up more than 10 percent over the life
of the loan.
 You receive more cash because you’ll usually have a lower 
initial rate.
A disadvantage to think about is that rate changes often, with no
cap on how much it can change per month/year. Although the rate
will never be more than 10 percentage points higher than your
original rate, the difference from month to month can seem alarm-
ing if it changes from 4.70 percent to 11.50 percent over the course
of a few months. 
Looking at the annual ARM
The monthly ARM isn’t for everyone. If you don’t have a strong
poker face to ride out higher interest rates, you will probably enjoy
the security of an annual ARM. Just as its name implies, the annual
ARM will only change once per year. If you lock in a great low initial
rate and then rates go up, you can smile smugly knowing that
you’re safe from an abrupt rate change for at least a year. 
Fortunately, you are protected by a couple of very generous rate
caps. Remember how the monthly ARM had a rate cap of 10 per-
cent over the life of the loan? Well the annual does it one better
and caps the rate at 5 percent above the original rate. So if your
originator locked in an annual rate of 4.20 percent, no matter how
long you keep the loan, you would never pay more than 9.20 per-
cent. However, unlike the monthly ARM, if rates go down through-
out the year, you won’t be able to take advantage of them until
your next annual rate change.
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
72

What’s even better, your rate can’t be raised more than 2 percent
per year. Let’s say that rates begin to rise again, and one year later
the loan you locked at 4.20 is now going for 7.30 percent. You are
safeguarded — your interest rate will only go up two percent, to
6.20.
Advantages to the annual ARM include:
 Retaining peace of mind from a year-long fixed rate.
 Rates can only go up 5 percent over the life of the loan.
 Rates can only go up 2 percent per year.
Disadvantages to think about include:
 You receive a lower loan limit because interest rates are 
generally higher.
 You can’t take advantage of lower rates if they drop through-
out the year.
Paying Up
Although you don’t actually have to pay the loan back until you
move out permanently, there are some fees that work their way
into your reverse mortgage. When you got your original mortgage,
you probably had to pay all of your fees up-front, even before you
got the keys to your new home. A reverse mortgage works a bit 
differently — most, if not all of your fees are rolled into your loan,
which your originator may call financing. (The only fee you may
not be able to finance is the appraisal fee, but your originator can
advise you about that when you discuss closing costs.) Those
amounts are added to the total you will owe on your loan. The FHA
knows that most people aren’t in a position to write checks that
large — an even distribution makes it simpler for everyone
involved. Instead of paying $5,000 up-front, that amount is added
to your loan balance and is paid back when you repay your entire
loan. Increasing your loan balance with closing costs will lower
your payouts very slightly if you choose to receive monthly
checks, because your total available loan amount is decreased. 
Typical closing cost amounts are below, but remember that they
may vary from city to city, or even from originator to originator:
Chapter 5: The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage 73

 $2,000–$5,806 for origination fees: The FHA states that an
originator can charge you no more than 2 percent of either
the total lending limit or the home’s value (whichever is less),
or $2,000, whichever is greater. We’ve calculated the maximum
origination fee based on the 2005 lending limit, $312,896. 
 $20 for a credit report: Originators use the information from
your credit report to determine whether or not you have any
outstanding federal tax liens (if, for instance, you didn’t pay
your taxes and the government has a claim on your home) or
other judgments. You will most likely already know if you have
outstanding debts, but a credit report keeps everything on the
“up and up.”
 $20 for flood certification: If you live on a federally desig-
nated flood plain, insurance and repair costs may affect your
loan. If you live in an area like this, you would have had to
have a similar certification on your previous loan.
 $50 for a courier: Just as it sounds, this is what the originator
charges you to cover the costs of mailing things with regards
to your loan. It’s so costly because they send everything by
overnight mail. Why overnight? You want your loan processed
quickly, don’t you? Your documents may travel to three or
four different offices, which can mean weeks of waiting time
by regular mail.
 $50–$100 for recording: Your county needs accurate informa-
tion about all housing-related information, including Deeds of
Trust and mortgages. Every loan (also referred to here as a
mortgage lien) must be recorded at your County Recorder’s
office, and this fee covers the charge to do so. 
 $75–$150 for document preparation: This is really an arbi-
trary service fee, because it doesn’t actually cost a specific
dollar amount to fill out paperwork, and it isn’t based on a
per-page or per-hour system. Some originators outsource this
work and may charge you exactly what that firm charges
them. Others rely on an in-house processor to do it, who gets
a salary that has nothing to do with this fee. Either way, it’s a
relatively inexpensive service.
 $100 for pest inspection: Because your home has to be struc-
turally sound in order to receive the loan, pest inspectors will
be deployed to test your home for things like termites and
other destructive bugs. If they find a problem, your home will
be debugged and you may need a follow-up inspection. Some
charge a secondary fee for the follow-up inspection, and some
only charge you once.
 $400–$600 for closing/settlement: This fee covers the title
search and any incidentals associated with the closing of the
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
74

loan. The title search shows who is currently on the home’s
title (who legally owns the home) and whether there are any
outstanding liens on it, like past mortgages you have yet to
pay off.
 $250 for the survey: Six years ago, your neighbor built a
fence that was two feet over on your side of the property line
and you’ve been fighting about it ever since. Well, you’ll finally
get your justice. In some states, a surveyor will come to your
home and establish the official boundaries for your property.
Start practicing your “I told you so.”
 $300–$400 for an appraisal: As with all FHA loans, your home
must be in good condition before the loan can be approved.
The appraiser will check for structural defects (leaky roof,
cracked foundation, and water damage, among others), as
well as make sure the property is up to code. If not, you’ll
need to make the changes (completed by a certified contrac-
tor) and submit to a re-exam. Don’t worry if you can’t afford to
make the changes right away — the FHA thought of that, too.
These costs can be bundled into your total loan, giving you up
to one year to fix your home’s glitches.
 Varying fee for title insurance: Your fees will include title
insurance, which is designed to protect both you and the
lender. The cost depends on the size of your loan (the higher
the loan amount, the higher the title insurance premiums).
Usually your originator will arrange this for you. All you have
to do is sign on the dotted line.
 At most, $30 per month for an annual ARM and $35 for a
monthly ARM for servicing fees: Servicing fees cover all the
after-close costs. Servicing refers to all of the tasks the lender
has to do once you’re receiving payments. This could be
menial paperwork like sending out your monthly statements,
or more involved chores like making sure you keep up your
end of the bargain and pay your property taxes, and that you
still live at the same address.
The servicing fee is a bit different from the others, in that the
lender sets aside the servicing fee. When calculating how much
to set aside, the lender multiplies the monthly fee ($30 or $35)
by the number of months they expect you to live in your home.
A 75-year-old borrower who was projected to live to be 86
would be charged for about 132 months, for a total servicing
fee between $3,960 and $4,620. This amount is deducted as a
whole from your total available loan funds and the whole pro-
jected fee is set aside, interest-free, until the monthly fee is
added to your growing loan balance each month. 
Chapter 5: The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage 75

 Varying fee for Mortgage Insurance Premiums (MIP): You
will never owe more than the value of your home at the time
the loan is due, whether you outlive your loan or not.
Everyone hopes that home values increase over time. But real
estate is a rocky business, and things don’t always go as
planned. The FHA protects you if, instead of increasing, your
home’s value has gone down. For example, if you borrow a
total of $97,200 and your home only sells for $85,000, you are
only liable for the selling price. The FHA is able to absorb that
loss because of MIP. MIP also protects you if you outlive your
loan by several years; the amount you owe will never exceed
your home’s value, no matter how much they’ve let you
borrow above and beyond your home’s value. In addition, the
MIP makes sure you still receive your check, even if some-
thing happens to your lender or originator. See the section
“Investing in Mortgage Insurance Premiums (MIP)” for more
information on this topic.
Investing in Mortgage Insurance
Premiums (MIP)
For years people were skeptical about the reverse mortgage
because there was an underlying myth and fear that once you
signed the papers, the bank owned your home. Seniors were afraid
that if they moved to an assisted-living or retirement home and
their home had gone down in value, they would owe ridiculous
amounts of money on their loan (remembering that the loan comes
due if you move out permanently). Adult children worried that if
their parents should die, they would be left with the burden of
coming up with the cash to pay back their parent’s loan. The FHA
thought of all that, too, and created Mortgage Insurance Premiums
(affectionately called MIP) as a protection for you, for your heirs,
and for itself.
Let’s say you have an HECM loan on a $245,000 house, worth a
total of $215,000. Time goes by, the economy changes, real estate
takes a turn for the worse, and today, your home is only worth
$145,000 — quite a significant drop. This also happens to be the
year that you decide to move in with your daughter and her family,
so you loan comes due. How will you pay the $70,000 difference?
The answer is simple — you don’t. Not directly anyway.
Technically, you pay for the difference in the form of MIP.
The MIP is broken down into two parts:
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
76

1. The FHA collects 2 percent of your home’s value or the
loan limit (whichever is higher) in order to insure that it’s
not left high and dry if your home value decreases, and you
aren’t left responsible for more loan than you bargained for.
2. The FHA also adds 0.5 percent to the interest rate that is
charged on your loan balance per month (in other words,
just the amount that you have already borrowed).
The MIP also protects you no matter what happens to your origina-
tor or lender. All HECM originators must be approved by FHA and
have to stick to a strict set of guidelines and a code of conduct. To
our knowledge, no FHA-approved lender has ever been unable to
send a borrower his or her check. But in case it ever happens, MIP
is there to protect your loan. It may be that the source went out of
business, and it may be a simple error — whatever the reason,
your MIP guarantees that the FHA will continue to pay your loan.
In order to get mortgage insurance on an HECM, you and your orig-
inator will fill out the HUD Addendum to Uniform Residential Loan
Application. In fact, anyone getting any kind of HUD loan, whether
it’s a reverse mortgage, VA (Veteran’s Affairs) loan, or another FHA
variety, is required to apply for mortgage insurance. The form itself
is fairly straightforward, but because it wasn’t specifically designed
for use with reverse mortgages, it has some questions that simply
don’t make sense for the HECM loan. The main components are:
 Your name, address, and property address (which will be the
same under the rules of the reverse mortgage)
 The name and address of the lender
 Your status as a homebuyer (whether you’re a first-time
homebuyer or not, and you’re obviously not)
 A certification from you that you have or have not owned or
sold another home with an FHA mortgage (what does it
matter? Who knows?)
 A statement that you understand the appraised value of your
home
There’s a lot of fine print, so ask your originator to explain it all if
you’re unable to read it clearly. Make sure you verify that all the
information is correct as you understand it before you sign.
Cashing In
There are several payment options to choose from, each with its
benefits and downfalls. Take a look at the options here and compare
Chapter 5: The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage 77

them to your comfort level when it comes to your money and how
you control it. 
Don’t worry if you feel like you’ve made the wrong decision after
your loan has started. You have the right to change your mind
about payment options at any time throughout the loan (but you
will be charged a $20 nominal fee).
Receiving monthly payments
If you prefer to receive a regular, pre-determined check, monthly
payments are probably for you. You will get the largest loan princi-
pal available with monthly payments, and it offers a peace of mind
to many seniors, knowing that they can count on a steady income. 
You can choose from two monthly payment options: “term” or
“tenure.” Both offer equal payments per month, but have signifi-
cant advantages and disadvantages to consider.
Timing terms
A term loan is one in which you choose how long you will receive
payments. 
Check out the following advantages:
 Receiving a larger check: You can get a larger check per
month if you choose a term loan because, if you pick a short
term, your money is condensed into a shorter timeframe
instead of being spread out until you move out of your home.
 Controlling your income: You choose how long you want to
receive payouts. If you know you are going to move into a new
home or go into assisted living in 5 years, you can get your
entire loan amount in that time. 
But don’t forget to consider the following drawbacks: 
 Getting less money total: Lenders tend to allot a lower total
loan amount to term borrowers because they are giving you
more money in each check (since it’s condensed into a few
years) than they would with a tenured monthly payment (see
“Securing monthly payments through tenure.”).
 Gambling on your term: The shorter your term, the bigger
your monthly payouts will be. For example, if you plan on a
seven-year term and are only able to stay in your home for
three years, you will have received smaller payouts that were
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
78

based on a longer term than if you had chosen a shorter term
to begin with. Planning ahead is essential to a term monthly
payout.
 Losing your monthly check: Once your term is up you stop
receiving payments, no matter how much longer you live in
the home, because you’ve used up all your money. The loan
still does not come due until you have permanently moved
out of your home, but your well will have run dry.
If you fit into the following situations, a term loan may be the best
choice for you:
 You have high monthly costs now but expect to have lower
costs in a few years, and you know you can put aside some of
your money as a cushion for the future. 
 You know for a fact that the day you turn 80 (five years from
now) you’re moving to an assisted-living apartment in Florida.
You could plan ahead and receive higher payments for that
period of time — those payments could be used in part to get
your affairs in order, pay for movers, and buy lots of sun-
screen.
Securing monthly payments through tenure
You may prefer the monthly tenure plan instead, which pays out
monthly until the last surviving homeowner dies or moves out. 
Some advantages to tenured payouts include:
 Maintaining a sense of security: You have the security of
knowing that you’ll never be without a check; the lender must
continue to send checks until the last remaining borrower
moves out permanently. 
 Receiving a higher total loan amount: You’ll almost always
get a bigger loan over time with a tenured monthly payment,
because although you get less per month, you’ll get more over
the life of the loan if you keep it for at least as long as the
lenders estimated you would. 
But check out the following drawbacks:
 Losing some financial independence: If you are planning a
trip or need to remodel to move your bedroom to the first
floor, the few hundred dollars you get per month isn’t going to
cover it. You either need to be able to save some money from
your check each month, or already have savings built up, and
simply use your monthly payments for daily living expenses. 
Chapter 5: The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage 79

 Unchanging tenure payments: At first, you may think the fact
that your payment amount never changes is a good thing, but
as the cost of living (inflation) increases over the life of your
loan, your check doesn’t increase with it. So your money is
worth less by the last few years of your loan, especially if you
got it in your 60s, when it’s likely you’ll have a 20-year loan.
Take a minute to think about the prices of things 20 years ago
compared with today. If you had received an HECM when they
were first made available (1989) and had a monthly payment
of $600, it would only be worth about $300 in today’s econ-
omy. The value of your dollar would have decreased by half! If
you are older, however, and only plan to have the loan for a
few years, inflation isn’t as much of a consideration. 
A tenured monthly payout may be the right choice for you if:
 You are concerned about running out of money. A tenured
payout plan lasts as long as you do, so there’s no fear of being
without a steady income.
 You don’t know how long you may be in your home and don’t
want to risk underestimating with a term payout.
 You don’t foresee any large expenses in the near future, or feel
confident that you can save some of your payout each month
to plan for upcoming bills.
Banking on a line of credit
A line of credit (also called a credit line) works like a bank account.
At the beginning of your loan, the entire available funds are sitting
in your account. You choose when to make a withdrawal and how
much you want at a time, and you’re only charged interest on the
portion you have actually received.
Credit lines are not permitted in Texas — if you live in the Lone
Star state, you have to choose either monthly payments (see
“Receiving monthly payments,” earlier in this chapter) or a lump
sum (see “Choosing a lump sum,” later in this chapter).
One of the niftiest things about the HECM line of credit is that your
available funds actually grow like a savings account! Even better,
the line of credit grows faster than most conventional savings
accounts, so it works to your advantage to keep as much of your
money as you can in the originator’s “bank” rather than your own.
The rate of your loan’s growth is based on this equation: your cur-
rent interest rate plus 0.5 percent, all divided by 12 (because it
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
80

accrues monthly). If, for example, the interest rate on your loan is
6 percent, the math would look like this:
1. 6 percent + 0.5 percent = 6.5 percent
2. 6.5 percent / 12 months = 0.54 percent
3. 0.54 percent = your percentage of growth
Your quarterly loan statement, which tells you how much you’ve
borrowed up to that point, will highlight the interest you’ve earned
on your unused funds.
You may be thinking that 0.54 percent doesn’t sound like much,
and it isn’t if it was growing on $100. You would only gain 54 cents.
But with a reverse mortgage, we’re talking about large sums of
money. If your loan amount is $100,000, using the example of a 6
percent interest rate above, you’ve earned $540 your first month
for a new total of $100,540! Credit lines compound monthly, which
means that every month your money will grow, and every month
the rate is applied to the new total. So, if you don’t withdraw any-
thing from that $100,540, you would earn interest based on the
above calculation on this new total ($100,540, not the previous
amount of $100,000), which comes out to about $543 the next
month. Each month after that, the new total would go through the
same calculation, and after just one year, if you didn’t withdraw
any money, you would earn $6,672!
The line of credit is a good choice if you have a monthly budget in
mind and have taken into account large or unexpected costs, like
vacations or medical bills. Like the monthly term loan (see “Timing
terms,” earlier in this chapter), when your account runs dry, that’s
it — no more money. It’s also an idea source of money for starting
your own business or making a solid investment. It requires some
planning ahead, but getting a credit line is a great way to manage
your HECM payments. 
Choosing a lump sum
If you know you’re going to need all of your HECM funds to pay for
a very big expense all at once (and immediately following your
loan closing), a lump sum may be the way to go. This would also
be a good option for people who have a savings account of their
own, but would rather take out a loan to pay for a specific need,
like starting a business. This is not the best option if you just want
to make a large purchase (like a car) or want to invest your money
elsewhere.
Chapter 5: The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage 81

A lump sum could come in handy, however, if you had to have a
medical procedure that will cost about the same as your loan
amount, your insurance wouldn’t cover it, and the doctor refused
to take installments. 
If you take a lump sum, you are charged interest on the entire
amount right away. You’d also better have a backup plan for future
finances, since once you receive the whole loan, you’re tapped out.
Again, you don’t have to repay the loan until you move out, but
you should have enough money to get you through to that point
after you’ve spent the lump sum.
Some people decide to take the lump sum and invest it in their
bank’s CDs or play the stock market. It’s true that some investments
will pay off big time, and yes, the average life of a stock pays you
pack around 8 percent. But there are several reasons why using
your lump sum as an investment isn’t such a hot idea:
 You will probably be paying a higher interest on the lump sum
than you are earning on your investment, which just means
you’re losing money.
 Most investments and savings accounts opened with lump-
sum funds won’t have as high or as steady of a return as the
interest on the credit line.
 If you throw all of your money into the stock market and it
takes a big dip, you could lose it all without sufficient time to
wait it out and earn your money back.
 A five-year bank CD with a rate of five percent (which is very
generous and not too common) will still earn you less than a
credit line with the same rate because the credit line com-
pounds monthly.
 If you use the lump sum to make a down payment on a
$300,000 yacht, not only are you charged interest on your
HECM loan, but the yacht dealer will charge you interest on
your purchase. 
Going with combinations
If more than one of the HECM loan options sounded like the perfect
solution to you, maybe what you really need is a combination of
two or more payment options. Are you the type of person who can
never order off the menu? Do you have a better idea about how
your payments should be structured? You’re in luck — the FHA
wants this loan to work for you. Your originator can guide you
through tailoring your payments to your individual circumstances.
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
82

Many HECM borrowers choose to receive a credit line or lump
sum, plus monthly payments. You don’t get the full credit
line/lump sum and the full loan’s worth of monthly payments
(that’s just wishful thinking). Instead, you break your loan apart
into sections: a portion goes into a credit line and/or lump sum
and a portion will be distributed monthly. This is so popular
because you get the best of both worlds: the security of a monthly
check, and the freedom of a larger available account. 
When you receive monthly payments in addition to your back-up
credit line, you are also protecting yourself from some of the effects
of inflation, because even though your monthly payments stay the
same, your available funds keep growing. If you can live on your
monthly check and leave the credit line pretty much alone for a
while, you’ll have a nice surprise when you finally decide to use 
it — extra money!
You can also choose to get a credit line and lump sum, without the
monthly payments. This is ideal if you have a large expense that
must be paid off in one fell swoop but want to keep earning inter-
est on the remaining balance. You could take a month-long cruise
to Alaska and pay for it up-front, and by the time you got back you’d
have earned another interest payment on your available funds!

Home Keeper Loans

I
f you read about the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)
in Chapter 5 and are discouraged by the low lending limits, then
the Fannie Mae Home Keeper loan may be for you. You will see a
lot of similarities between the HECMs and Fannie Mae loans in this
chapter, but there are significant differences as well. Fannie Mae
offers many of the same features that the HECM provides, but
because Fannie Mae is a private company, it can afford to have
higher maximums and lower fees. (For those lucky few whose
home value is substantially higher than the FHA or Fannie Mae
lending limits, a jumbo loan may be your best bet. We show you in
Chapter 7 how larger loans make reverse mortgages possible for
higher-valued homes.)
There are two variations of the Fannie Mae loan: the Home Keeper
and Home Keeper for Purchase. They work very much like the
HECM (see Chapter 5), in that you will receive payments over the
course of the loan, and you will not owe anything on the loan until
you die or permanently move out of the home. The difference
between the two Fannie Mae loans is just as you may have guessed:
Home Keeper is for those who wish to stay in their current home,
and Home Keeper for Purchase helps seniors who want to use
their equity to buy new homes.

While Home Keeper loans are not secured by the federal govern-
ment, they are backed by Fannie Mae — if your lender fails to pay
you for whatever reason, Fannie Mae will step in to make sure your
loan is doled out as usual. 
In this chapter we show you all the ins and outs of the Fannie Mae
reverse mortgage and show you how it differs from the other two
major loan products.
Buying a New Home
For years, seniors who planned to use the equity from their house
to get some ready cash through reverse mortgages were essentially
forced to stay in their current homes, even though their lifestyles
warranted a change. Many people were understandably unsatisfied
with this arrangement. After all, the way you live in your retirement
can be drastically different than your working lifestyle, and your
home will probably reflect that. If you’ve been thinking about get-
ting a reverse mortgage because you want to take advantage of
your equity, but you’d rather live somewhere else, the Home
Keeper for Purchase may be for you.
Here’s how it works: If you own your home free and clear, you can
use the equity that you’ve built up over the years to help pay for
your new home, without ever having to make a mortgage payment
until you permanently move out of that new residence. If you don’t
own your home debt-free, but you’re close, Fannie Mae allows you
to work the remaining balance into your new loan (finance it) by
taking out a sum of money right away and using it to pay off the
remainder of your existing mortgage. The downside is that, unlike
a regular reverse mortgage, you won’t receive payments. You won’t
have payments of your own to make either, which may make this
option worth it to you.
You are free to buy the home of your dreams with a Home Keeper,
whatever it may be. Some people upgrade, but many use the loan
to get something more practical. Typical Home Keeper purchases
include:
 Wheelchair-accessible homes: This is especially useful for
people who currently live on property that features lots of
stairs, hills, rocky terrain, or small doorways. Many homes are
built today with the standard wheelchair turning radius in
mind, and some include electric or hydraulic countertops that
can actually lower to a comfortable height (and then raise
back up again).
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
86

 One-story homes: Usually ranch-style homes or one-story
designs allow for single-level living. No more climbing stairs or
rummaging around in a dark and smelly basement. This can
also be safer — that’s just one fewer sets of stairs to fall down.
 Smaller homes: Many seniors still live in the homes they
raised their children in, which is often more house than they
need. A smaller house can be a lot easier to maintain, and less
expensive (heating and cooling costs alone would make a
huge difference).
 Warmer climate: Who wants to shovel snow when there are
beaches and sunny desserts to frolic in? Seniors moving to
warmer climates may be a bit of a cliché, but come on . . . you
know you’ve been thinking about it.
The Home Keeper for Purchase can be a wonderful solution to
many housing problems, but it isn’t always the best answer for
everyone. Your counselor can run your financial needs through the
Home Keeper for Purchase calculator to help you decide if this is a
loan you want to pursue. There are a few things to keep in mind
before getting a Home Keeper for Purchase:
 You will often receive less money than you would with a regu-
lar Home Keeper loan.
 Any outstanding mortgage debts must be paid off (either by
you or by the loan) before you can apply the money to a new
home.
 Your loan is for the purchase of a home only — you won’t get
a monthly check, line of credit, or additional lump sum to go
along with it.
Making a down payment
Before you can apply for a Home Keeper for Purchase loan, you
have to be able to prove that you have a sufficient down payment
for your next home. What counts as sufficient will vary depending
on your age and how much you need to borrow. The younger you
are, the more you’ll probably have to pay out-of-pocket as a down
payment. For example, people who run out to get a reverse mort-
gage on their 62nd birthday will probably have to pay upwards of
70 percent of the down payment out of their own savings. However,
a 90-year-old will only be responsible for paying about 30 percent
of the total down payment — yet another good reason to wait a
few years if possible to get your reverse mortgage.
Chapter 6: Figuring Out the Fannie Mae Home Keeper Loans 87

Like a forward mortgage’s down payment, your funds can come
from any of three major sources:
 Your savings
 Your investments
 The proceeds from the sale of your home (if the down pay-
ment is more than Fannie Mae will lend you)
Figuring out what you can afford
One of the greatest benefits of a Home Keeper for Purchase is that
you may be able to afford a slightly higher valued home that you
wouldn’t ordinarily be able to buy. Because reverse mortgages
don’t base your loan on credit scores or income levels, the two fac-
tors that usually drag a loan value down, you may be able to get
more money out of the Home Keeper for Purchase than you would
with a regular forward mortgage. But don’t start touring mansions
quite yet. The operative words here are “may” be able to afford a
“slightly” more expensive home. The Home Keeper isn’t going to
get you into a lakeshore condo if you’re currently living in a one-
room shack, but with the right equity and a decent down payment,
you may be able to move up a little in the housing world. 
You may want to use this extra boost to buy a lovely little retire-
ment home, or go all out and get the most house for your money.
Either way, remember that if you get the loan when you’re rela-
tively young and have to throw a significant portion of your exist-
ing savings into a down payment, you’re going to be hard-pressed
when it comes time to put food on the table since the Home
Keeper for Purchase does not continue to pay you over the life of
the loan — it lives up to its name and is “for purchase” only. People
are making a habit of living beyond their means these days, but
you can control your future finances by declining to buy a home
that you really can’t afford. A good counselor and/or originator will
help you sort out your finances so that you can clearly see what
you can reasonably afford.
Before you get your heart set on a Home Keeper for Purchase, do
some investigating. Find out how much equity is in your home,
how much homes cost in the area you want to live in, and what it
would cost to modify the home you’re in now. It may make more
sense for you to sell your home on your own and buy a new one in
the traditional way, or to get another type of reverse mortgage to
make improvements on your existing home. If home prices are
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
88

much higher where you want to live, you may be in for a rude
awakening when you try to apply your equity. If you’re no good
with math, ask a friend or family member to help you sort out the
numbers, or take your concerns to your counselor (more on how
to prepare for a counselor session in Chapter 8).
Meeting the Requirements
Home Keeper and Home Keeper for Purchase have the same
requirements (which makes perfect sense, since they’re from the
same company). You must:
 Be at least 62 years old
 Be a homeowner with at least some equity in your home
 Live in your home full-time
 Own a qualified home (see “Qualifying homes,” later in this
chapter)
 Meet with a Fannie Mae-approved counselor
Anyone on the loan must meet these requirements. Fannie Mae
Home Keeper loans can have up to three borrowers in one home,
although this is unusual (loans are more commonly made for sin-
gles and couples). Loans with three borrowers are often a couple
and an adult child who all meet the above requirements, but could
also be siblings or friends, as long as every borrower qualifies.
Keep in mind that you don’t have to meet all of the eligibility rules
to live in the house — you only have to meet all the requirements
to be named on the loan. 
You must meet with an approved reverse mortgage counselor
before you can get any reverse mortgage loan. Counselors are
there to guide you (but not choose for you) and help you distin-
guish between your choices. What’s a little different about the
Home Keeper requirement is that Fannie Mae recommends that
you see a non-profit HUD counselor or a Fannie Mae counselor. But
don’t worry — all counselors, no matter their affiliation, should
give you a fair, unbiased view of all your loan options. Although
they must use Fannie Mae approved “curriculum” in your counsel-
ing session to explain the Home Keeper loans, you can expect the
counselors to give you an honest assessment of your financial situ-
ation and present all of your options equally. For more on finding a
counselor, go to Chapter 8 and read up on your counselor options.
Chapter 6: Figuring Out the Fannie Mae Home Keeper Loans 89

Qualifying homes
Housing options are almost the same as the HECM qualifying
homes, although Fannie Mae can be somewhat strict about meet-
ing housing requirements. To qualify for a Home Keeper loan your
home must be either:
 A single-family home (one that is detached from other people’s
homes and is constructed on a permanent foundation)
 A condominium
 A home in a planned unit development project, townhouse, or
manufactured home that meets Fannie Mae requirements
To find out if your condo, planned unit development (sometimes
referred to as PUD), or other non-traditional home is eligible for a
Home Keeper loan, ask your originator. Local originators will prob-
ably know right away, but out-of-towners will probably need to
look up your community on the Fannie Mae Web site. Why not get
proactive and do it yourself? When you’re dealing with such a big
financial decision, you should be (or at least feel) as prepared as
possible every step of the way. 
To find out if your condo or other PUD is eligible under Fannie
Mae, go to www.efanniemae.com. Toward the bottom of the page
you’ll see “Single Family” in orange letters — click on “origination
and underwriting” directly below that. Then under “Reference
Tools and Information” click on the first option, “Accepted condo/
co-op/PUDs.” Here you’ll find state listings; just click on your state
and find your development in the alphabetical listing. Print out the
listing to take with you the first time you meet with your originator.
Just imagine how impressed they’ll be that you found this all on
your own! 
Making necessary repairs
If you think you’re off the hook because your home fits into one of
these categories, just wait. In addition to these restrictions, Fannie
Mae states that your home can’t have more than 15 percent of the
property value in necessary repairs. If your home is worth $100,000
but has a leaking roof, poor plumbing, and termite damage that will
cost $18,000 to replace, your home won’t be eligible until the
repairs are made (or make some repairs to reduce the cost to less
than $15,000 in this case). You may be surprised how fast those
little repairs can add up. Keep in mind, too, that these are neces-
sary repairs — we’re not talking creaky floor board, but rather a
stove that leaks gas or other dangerous problem.

It will be your responsibility to obtain bids for the costs of any
required repairs from a licensed contractor and submit those bids
to the originator. Many people don’t have the money needed to
complete big repairs up-front, so Fannie Mae allows repairs to be
completed after your reverse mortgage closes. Funds to pay for
those repairs will be reserved and held in your line of credit until
the repairs are completed and inspected. Generally the repairs will
need to be completed within six months.
Reaching Higher Borrowing Limits
The big question is always, “how much can I borrow?” You’ll be
pleased to find out that Fannie Mae loans have much higher lend-
ing limits (the maximum amount Fannie Mae will lend) than the
HECM (see Chapter 5), and Fannie Mae does not set a prescribed
Chapter 6: Figuring Out the Fannie Mae Home Keeper Loans 91
Holding homes in trust
Many seniors’ homes and other property are held in a trust to protect their assets.
The deed to the house is owned by your trust, and generally speaking, the senior is
both the trustee as well as the beneficiary. It’s also common for an adult child or
someone else you’ve designated to act as the trustee on your behalf. 
Fannie Mae allows for a Home Keeper mortgage in some cases when a home is
held in trust. The trust will have to meet certain guidelines to be acceptable for
Home Keeper (or the HECM program for that matter). The guidelines are:
 The trust must be an intervivos (living) trust, which means that you created the
trust while you were still living.
 The trust must be revocable (able to be canceled). There are times when a mar-
ried couple creates a revocable trust that becomes irrevocable when one of
them dies. This would only be acceptable if the trust became partially revoca-
ble and the property remained in the portion of the trust that can be repealed.
 The trust must have the right to encumber (get a mortgage on) the property. If
your adult children hold the trust but you don’t want them to be able to mort-
gage your home, you can remove this encumber clause. But until the trustee
has a right to get a loan, Fannie Mae won’t allow the house to be mortgaged.
 The beneficiaries of the trust must be the only borrowers. Anyone else on the
trust would only be beneficiaries after the death of the borrowers.
Be prepared to provide a copy of the trust agreement and any amendments to the
originator so it can be reviewed to make sure it’s acceptable. Your personal attor-
ney or financial planner should have a copy if you’ve misplaced it.

lending minimum. In 2005, the maximum lending limit was
$359,650, a whopping $46,754 higher than the HECM’s highest lend-
ing limit, and an incredible $187,018 higher than the HECM lower
end of the lending maximums. That can make a huge difference if
you live in a higher-valued home, no matter what loan maximum
you fall under. However, don’t be fooled into thinking that you’ll
automatically get the full $359,650. There are factors that contribute
to the calculation of your loan, just like you found in the HECM:
 The national home value average: What does it have to do
with you? Fannie Mae uses an adjusted property value (your
actual home value as compared to the national average home
value) as a starting basis for your total loan amount. If your
home’s actual value is at or above the national average, you
can expect to get more from your reverse mortgage than if
your home value was significantly lower.
 Your age: Generally speaking, the older you are, the more you
will be able to borrow. The age consideration in Home Keeper
reverse mortgages is based on the combined ages of all bor-
rowers on a particular loan.
 Interest Rates: Home Keeper loans are based on a monthly
adjustable rate mortgage (ARM). The lower interest rates are
when you initially get your reverse mortgage, the more you
will be able to borrow.
Adjusting expectations
Fannie Mae calculates an adjusted property value to figure out how
much of your home value it can actually let you borrow. Your
adjusted property value doesn’t necessarily (if ever) equal the
actual value of your home, nor does it equal the amount you can
ultimately borrow. Adjusted property value is just a basis to deter-
mine your loan amount. Fannie Mae compares your home value to
the national averages and determines your principal amount (the
actual dollars borrowed) partially based on that comparison (along
with age and interest rates). Any home with a total worth above
the maximum value will probably be assigned a $359,650 adjusted
property value. As a home value creeps further away from this
number (lower than the national average), the amount that home
owner could borrow goes down as well.
Fannie Mae bases its lending limit on the national average home
price. Combine all the home values in America and divide it by the
number of homes, and you’ve got the magic number: $359,650.
This means that about half of America’s home values will fall below
that number, and about half will be above it.

HECM limits change depending on the county your property is 
in (see Chapter 5), but Fannie Mae’s adjusted property value of
$359,650 is the same all over the country. If you live in an area with
a lower HECM maximum but own a home with a much higher value,
the Home Keeper loan may be able to put more money in your
pocket. 
Considering age
The next-largest factor in your loan limit is your age, and the
Fannie Mae rules may surprise you. The older you are, the more
money you can ultimately receive. This is because a younger bor-
rower suggests that the lender has to spend more time servicing
the loan since they will probably have it longer than an older bor-
rower, and the loan would accumulate more interest. Of course,
this is not always the case, but Fannie Mae has to hedge its bets.
Fannie Mae includes the following considerations when looking at
borrowers’ ages:
 Marital status: Fannie Mae relies on actuarial tables that take
your marital status into account. Instead of drawing on one
person’s age, it considers both borrowers’ ages as it calcu-
lates the loan. 
If you’re married, you’re about to get some good news and
some bad news. The good news is, you’re statistically going 
to live longer than an unmarried person. The bad news is,
you’re not going to get to borrow as much as a singleton
would. Studies have shown time and time again that married
people have lower blood pressure, better overall health, and a
more positive state of mind, leading to longer, happier lives.
(Incidentally, the same is true for dog and cat owners, healthy
eaters, and people who do yoga, but so far Fannie Mae hasn’t
caught on.) What this means for you is that a single 75-year-
old man will get more out of his equity with a Home Keeper
loan than a 75-year-old couple. Still, don’t let this discourage
you from getting a Fannie Mae loan — the generally higher
loan limit may be enough to sway you in the Home Keeper’s
direction. 
 Number of borrowers: Fannie Mae allows up to three borrow-
ers on the loan. This is pretty uncommon, but it can come in
handy in certain situations. This is usually an adult child and
his or her parents (for example, a 65-year-old woman and her
87-year-old parents), or a senior couple and a single (very
senior) parent. As you can imagine, the lending limits would
be much higher for the 87-year-olds, so Fannie Mae bases the
Chapter 6: Figuring Out the Fannie Mae Home Keeper Loans 93

loan limit on the ages of the youngest two borrowers. If, as in
the example above, that’s 65 and 87, the ages are considered
in the same way they would be for a married couple of the
same ages.
Although your loan limit goes down by listing adult children
as borrowers, having adult children on the loan is often a
good way to feel secure that the home will go to the proper
heir (the adult children) if you don’t want to create a trust.
You also have the security of knowing that the loan is not
repaid until the last surviving borrower dies or moves out.
Keep in mind, however, that any adult child on the loan must
use the home as his or her primary residence. They actually
have to live in the house to be a borrower.
Factoring in interest rates
All Home Keeper loans are based on a monthly adjustable rate
mortgage (ARM), a rate that changes every month for the life of
the loan. The sections that follow discuss how the rate works and
how it affects your loan.
Understanding the monthly ARM
Although the rate changes every month, Fannie Mae put rate caps
in place for the monthly ARM to keep you from paying outrageously
high interest rates in the future. Over the course of your loan, your
interest rate can never (ever, no matter what) go up more than 12
percent higher than your original rate. If you got a Home Keeper
loan today at a rate of 4.09 percent, and in three years the same
loan is going for 20.3 percent (not likely, but let’s just imagine), you
will only be looking at an interest rate of 16.09 percent (4.09 plus
12) because you have that 12 percent rate cap in place. 
Home Keeper rate caps don’t put a limit on how much your inter-
est rate can change month-to-month (as long as it’s not more than
12 percent), so you may have a rate of 4.09 percent in May and 8.34
in June. While this seems like a big jump, don’t worry too much
about the rates. Monthly rates change so often that if you don’t
like where your rate is this month, chances are that you’ll be hap-
pier with it next month.
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
94

Your interest rate has an effect on the total loan balance you’re
accumulating, but it doesn’t have any effect on your monthly pay-
ments. Although a higher rate will grow your debt at a faster pace,
you will keep receiving the same checks — no matter what.
Calculating interest rates
The Home Keeper factors in two things when calculating its inter-
est rates:
 The most current weekly average of secondary market
interest rates on one-month CDs. 
You can see for yourself what the current one-month, second-
ary market CD rate is by going to www.federalreserve.gov/
releases/h15/current. Scan a few rows down and you can
see the CD secondary markets, and below that, the one-month
row. Now look to the right and find the column with the head-
ing closest to today’s date. That’s the one-month secondary
market CD rate.
If you’ve ever invested in a certificate of deposit (CD) at your
bank, you know that there are different term lengths for CD
investments. Most are one-year or five-year terms with fixed
rates, but certain accounts adjust more often than others.
Usually, the longer the term, the higher the interest rate,
which means a better return when you finally cash it out.
Long-term CDs are good for investors, but the shortest-term
CD, the one-month, is great for borrowers. Not only does it
have the lowest rate, but it changes so often that even high
rates don’t stick around for long.
 A margin. A margin is the amount that originators can add to
the index to create your rate. The maximum margin on a
Home Keeper loan is 3.40 percent. For example, if the second-
ary market interest rate for one-month CDs is at 2.20 percent,
your interest rate at that moment could only be a maximum of
5.60 percent (2.20 plus 3.40).
Every week is a new week for interest rates, so don’t make
yourself crazy trying to time the markets or choose your
reverse mortgage product based on getting the lowest rates
around. This week, the Home Keeper loans may be offering a
lower rate, but next week, the Home Keeper loans could be
offering the highest. So, when it comes down to it, it’s better
to find a loan you’re comfortable with, get an originator you
like and trust, and feel good about your decision, than to rush
into a loan because you think the rates are going to rise.
Besides, by the time you find an originator, start the paper
work, and close the loan, rates will have already changed.
Chapter 6: Figuring Out the Fannie Mae Home Keeper Loans 95

Evaluating the Costs
You can’t get something for nothing in this world, and Home Keeper
loans are no exception. 359,650Closing cost fees are usually less 
on a Home Keeper loan than they are on HECMs (see Chapter 5).
Admittedly the difference isn’t huge, but if every penny counts,
this is a good time to start counting. Fannie Mae doesn’t charge
you the up-front mortgage insurance premium (MIP) that the FHA
does for the HECM loan, which means lower fees for you (but not
as much peace of mind).
We list some of the common fees associated with closing costs here:
 $2,000–$6,674 for origination fees: Home Keeper origination
fees can’t exceed $2,000 or 2 percent of the adjusted property
value, whichever is greater. Generally speaking, if your adjusted
property value is $100,000 or less, you will only pay up to
$2,000, but if your home value is near the maximum, you will
pay $7,193 (which is 2 percent of $359,650). But remember —
these are maximums. Originators have the option to charge a
lesser fee if they wish, so it can pay to shop around for lower
fees. Think about it: If your home’s adjusted value is at or near
the maximum, you’re going to be paying the maximum fees —
any fee reduction may be worth it. 
 $20 for a credit report: Originators use the information from
your credit report to determine whether or not you have any
outstanding federal tax liens (if, for instance, you didn’t pay
your taxes and the government has a claim on your home) or
other judgments. You will most likely already know if you have
outstanding debts, but a credit report keeps everything on the
“up and up.”
 $20 for flood certification: If you live on a federally desig-
nated flood plane, insurance and repair costs may affect your
loan. If you live in an area like this, you would have had to
have a similar certification on your previous loan.
 $50 for a courier: Just as it sounds, this is what the originator
charges you to cover the costs of mailing things with regards
to your loan. It’s so costly because they send everything by
overnight mail so your loan is processed quickly.
 $50–$100 for recording: Your county needs accurate informa-
tion about all housing-related information, including Deeds of
Trust and mortgages. Every loan (also referred to here as a
mortgage lien) must be recorded at your County Recorder’s
office, and this fee covers the charge to do so. 
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
96

 $75–$150 for document preparation: This is really an arbi-
trary service fee, because it doesn’t actually cost a specific
dollar amount to fill out paperwork, and it isn’t based on a
per-page or per-hour system. Some originators outsource this
work, and may charge you exactly what that firm charges
them. Others rely on an in-house processor to do it, who gets
a salary that has nothing to do with this fee. Either way, it’s a
relatively inexpensive service.
 $100 for pest inspection: Because your home has to be struc-
turally sound in order to receive the loan, pest inspectors will
be deployed to test your home for things like termites and
other destructive bugs. If they find a problem, your home will
be debugged and you may need a follow-up inspection. Some
charge a secondary fee for the follow-up inspection, and some
only charge you once.
 $400–$600 for closing/settlement: This fee covers the title
search and any incidentals associated with the closing of the
loan. The title search shows who is currently on the home’s
title (who legally owns the home) and whether there are any
outstanding liens on it, like past mortgages you have yet to
pay off.
 $250 for the survey: Six years ago, your neighbor built a
fence that was two feet over on your side of the property line
and you’ve been fighting about it ever since. Well, you’ll finally
get your justice. In some states, a surveyor will come to your
home and establish the official boundaries for your property.
Start practicing your “I told you so.”
 $300–$400 for an appraisal: As with all FHA loans, your home
must be in good condition before the loan can be approved.
The appraiser will check for structural defects (leaky roof,
cracked foundation, and water damage, among others), as
well as make sure the property is up to code. If not, you’ll
need to make the changes (completed by a certified contrac-
tor) and submit to a re-exam. Don’t worry if you can’t afford to
make the changes right away — the FHA thought of that, too.
These costs can be bundled into your total loan, giving you up
to one year to fix your home’s glitches.
 Varying fee for title insurance: Your fees will include title
insurance, which is designed to protect both you and the
lender. The cost depends on the size of your loan (the higher
the loan amount, the higher the title insurance premiums).
Usually your originator will arrange this for you. All you have
to do is sign on the dotted line.
 At most, $30 per month for servicing fees: A servicing fee
helps pay for all the man-hours the lender puts in after your
Chapter 6: Figuring Out the Fannie Mae Home Keeper Loans 97

loan has closed. This can include processing monthly pay-
ments to you, sending you a monthly (or at least quarterly)
statement of your account, providing draws on a line of credit,
and monitoring on an annual basis that you have paid your
property taxes and kept hazard insurance in force on your
property. Servicing fees are a flat rate, which means that they
will not fluctuate as your interest rate changes, or your loan
balance grows.
Fannie Mae has set the servicing fee limits at a maximum of
$30 a month, but the servicing fee charged can vary from
lender to lender, so you’ll want to show you’re savvy and ask
about it.
Getting the Check
Designed with your individual needs in mind, the Home Keeper
loans offer three payment options: monthly payments, a line of
credit, or a combination of these. 
Fannie Mae also has a less-publicized lump sum option. Ask your
originator or counselor to consider this choice if you need to
access your entire payment in one fell swoop.
Payment decisions are made at closing, but don’t feel pressured to
make a choice that’s set in stone. You have the right to change
your mind at any time for a moderate fee (no more than $50),
which can be financed as part of your loan. You can also have the
fee taken out of your next payment, which is usually a good option
if you have the money to spare and don’t want interest charged on
that small fee.
Simplifying with monthly payments
Home Keeper monthly payments are set up on a tenure plan, which
means that they are evenly distributed throughout the life of the
loan. Your tenure monthly payments never change, no matter what
(as long as you uphold your end of the mortgage agreement:
paying your taxes and homeowner’s insurance, and keeping up
with home repairs). 
Consider these advantages to monthly tenure payments:
 Feeling secure: Because your monthly payments never
change, tenure payments are a great way to ensure that 
you’ll always have a steady income.
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
98

 Saving extra cash: You can deposit the money any way you
wish. Build a savings account with any leftover funds, or open
up a CD, which typically earns interest at a higher rate than
the rate of inflation. You’ll be ahead of the game, securing a
nest egg for yourself.
 Stopping payments temporarily: You have the option of stop-
ping and starting payments as necessary. Many borrowers
choose to suspend payments to avoid losing certain benefits
that may be affected by income. For example, borrowers who
receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Medicaid pay-
ments may want to let their funds accumulate, since they
probably don’t need the Home Keeper payments right away. If
you are trying to get SSI and are afraid you’ll appear to have
too much money to qualify, suspending payments is a smart
(and legal) alternative. Keep in mind, however, that interest
and fees will keep building even though the checks have been
temporarily stopped. 
Don’t forget to also consider these drawbacks:
 Unchanging payments: Payments don’t adjust for inflation.
While $500 per month sounds pretty good now, in 20 years it
could only be worth half that in future dollars. 
 Needing to make a large purchase: Consider what you plan
to use your reverse mortgage payments for. If you want to make
a large purchase and can’t take the time to save up for it, a
line of credit may be a better option because your monthly
payments aren’t likely to be enough to make large purchases.
If you fit into the following situations, monthly tenure payments
may be the best choice for you:
 You’re one of those undisciplined folks who may be in danger
of spending all your money at once on a fancy new car, then
have nothing left for the basics like food.
 You don’t have a plan for your money beyond day-to-day
living expenses and don’t need a large sum.
Building a line of credit
With a Home Keeper line of credit you can take out any amount
you wish — up to your total available amount — at any time. Use a
little here to pay for your new computer, a little there to buy a new
muffler for the car, then take out a larger sum to fund that dream
Hawaiian holiday. When and how you get your cash is up to you. 
Chapter 6: Figuring Out the Fannie Mae Home Keeper Loans 99

Check out the benefits to the line of credit option:
 Paying yourself back: You can pay yourself back as you draw
on your funds. You may hear this referred to as a revolving
line of credit. You can take out $650 in March for that trip to
Las Vegas, and pay yourself back $650 in June when you win 
it all back at your weekly canasta game. That money is then
ready to be used again. 
Accruing interest only on what you use: Interest is only
accrued on the amount of money that you have actually taken
out — not on the entire amount available. That’s why it pays
to only draw on what you need at one time.
If you know you’ll need a certain amount of money for an
upcoming expense, that’s one thing, but if you’re just estimat-
ing how much you think you’ll need for groceries in the next
month, a tenure payment (see “Simplifying with monthly pay-
ments,” earlier in this chapter) may be a better choice for you.
 Relieving a mortgage burden: You can pay off significant 
portions of your loan, making this a great tool for people who
want their heirs to inherit their homes, without inheriting a
mortgage burden.
The only caveat is that if you pay the loan back in full, you
end the loan. This can be a good thing (you don’t have to
worry about your family repaying the loan or having to sell
the house) or a bad thing (you won’t have access to any more
loan money). 
Consider the following drawbacks:
 Making no money off of interest: A big (and potentially
costly) difference between the HECM (see Chapter 5) and the
Home Keeper loans is that the available funds in your Fannie
Mae line of credit do not accrue interest in your favor as time
goes by. One of the benefits of the HECM line of credit is that
your unused funds grow, creating a larger amount available to
you (similar to a savings account earning interest). With the
Home Keeper, you only get what you started with.
 Running out of funds: Some people get a bit overzealous at
the prospect of such a large amount of money at their ready
disposal and spend their money too quickly. Once you’ve
used up your line of credit, you’re tapped out — you won’t
have access to any more reverse mortgage funds. Be sure you
budget carefully before you start to spend your line of credit.
If you fit into the following situations, monthly tenure payments
may be the best choice for you:
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
100

 You have a large expense in mind, have another form of
income or savings, or only plan to use the reverse mortgage
funds every once in a while.
 You need money to spend but plan to pay off large portions of
the loan so your heirs can inherit the house but not the mort-
gage burden.
The line of credit option isn’t available in Texas — this isn’t a
Fannie Mae rule, it’s Texas’s. For those who live in the Lone Star
State but need a lot of cash right away, the HECM lump sum may
be a better choice for you (see Chapter 5). 
Combining your options
Under the Home Keeper loan, you are allowed to combine your
payment options into what Fannie Mae calls a modified tenure plan.
With modified tenure, you get the best of both worlds: steady, pre-
dictable monthly payments plus a line of credit. The money is split
however you like — for example, on a $94,000 loan, you could
choose to take $6,000 in a line of credit and the remaining amount
($88,000) as monthly payments. Or you could reverse that. Or shift
the percentages of each payment type up or down in whatever way
works best for you. Your counselor or originator can help you split
your money in a way you’re comfortable with.
Consider some of the following advantages:
 Gaining financial autonomy: The modified tenure plan is a 
popular choice for Home Keeper borrowers because it gives you
a backup fund (the line of credit) as well as a monthly income.
 Retaining flexibility: Those who prefer a higher monthly pay-
ment but want a small cushion of money can get their funds
exactly the way they want them. Others who don’t need as
much per month can choose a higher line of credit.
 Changing your mind: You can always redistribute your
money however you see fit. You may be charged that $50
“paperwork” fee, but many lenders may waive it just to stay in
your good graces. It’s worth asking for a discounted fee, since
many won’t advertise the fact that they often let it slide.
But check out the following drawbacks:
 Lower monthly payouts: If you use up your line of credit for a
large expense and rely solely on your monthly checks, you
may have to tighten your belt — your monthly payouts are
decreased to account for the line of credit you’ve borrowed.
Chapter 6: Figuring Out the Fannie Mae Home Keeper Loans 101

 Keeping track of two accounts: As if you didn’t have enough
on your mind! If you choose a combination, you’ll have two
bank books to balance, and two sources of income to account
for. If you have any trouble managing your money, a simpler
method is to choose a single payout option.
The modified tenure plan may be the right choice for you if:
 You know that you need a larger amount of money up-front
(perhaps to remodel, travel, or start your own business) but
don’t need the entire principal at once.
 You think you may need access to a big chunk of money in the
future (for medical bills or continuing education, for example)
and need a great way to ensure that you’ll have that money
set aside.
You don’t have to be a math whiz to work out your distributions.
You can choose how much of your principal you want to set aside
for your line of credit, and Fannie Mae will divide the rest into
monthly payments (minus any monthly or financed fees). For
example, if they’ve estimated that you will keep your $75,000 loan
for 10 years and you choose to sock away $10,000, that leaves a
$65,000 balance or $500 per month. This is where monthly budget-
ing can really come in handy — if you know how much you’ll need
per month, it’s easier to guess how much to set aside.
It’s up to you how much you want to allocate to each part of the
loan. Just keep in mind that the more you stash in reserve, the
lower your monthly payments.
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
102
Planning for the future
Try this experiment: a few months before you decide to meet with an originator or
counselor about your reverse mortgage, estimate how much you will need per
month. Write it down and tuck that hypothesis in your nightstand drawer. Then keep
a detailed account of every penny that goes in or out of your home. Groceries, hair-
cuts, veterinarian bills, car insurance, gifts — anything that affects your bottom line.
Don’t try to spend any differently than usual, because you want an accurate reflec-
tion of the way you really live. At the end of your experiment, take a hard look at how
much you actually spent per month. Average the totals (add each month’s total and
then divide that dollar amount by the number of months in the experiment) and com-
pare that to your guess. If you were close, good for you! If you guessed too low, you’ll
need to assess your finances to make sure that whatever you’ll get from a monthly
payment that’s been reduced by the credit line is enough to live on comfortably. The
best part is, you’ll be fully prepared to explain your financial needs at your first coun-
selor or originator meeting. You’ll be ahead of the game and they’ll be very impressed.

I
n many neighborhoods, housing prices have gotten so out of
control, only a small percentage of residents can actually afford
to purchase a home. When that’s the case, you may not want to sink
all your equity into a new home that could start to drop in price
when the housing “bubble” bursts. Jumbo reverse mortgage loans
allow you to keep your home, use the equity you’ve built, and never
worry about a decrease in the value (inflated or not) of your home.
Still others live in neighborhoods that were always pricey and, pre-
sumably, always will be. In high-cost areas — like Southern California,
parts of Colorado, and Manhattan — you’d be hardpressed to find
a home below the Fannie Mae limit of $333,700 (see Chapter 5). A
jumbo loan can help you stay where you are and give you the extra
money you need. Use it to maintain your property, take a long holi-
day . . . anything you like.
In this chapter, we show you the nuances of the jumbo loan and its
main proprietor, Financial Freedom.
Figuring Out Jumbo Cash Accounts
A system with loan limits and maximums doesn’t work for every-
one, especially those who own homes that are worth more than

the Fannie Mae (see Chapter 5) and FHA (see Chapter 4) limits
combined! If you fall into that category, have we got good news for
you — Jumbo Cash Account reverse mortgages have virtually no
limits.
Meeting Financial Freedom
Those enormous loans don’t materialize out of thin air. That’s a lot
of money to lend, and someone has to foot the bill. Jumbo Cash
Accounts are also often called private lender or proprietary loans
because the companies who fund them are individual private cor-
porations. They have no ties to the government (which has its ben-
efits and challenges) and can essentially create their own interest
rate basis, loan requirements, and eligibility.
The biggest and most prevalent financer of reverse mortgage
Jumbo Cash Accounts is called Financial Freedom (you can find out
more about Financial Freedom and get free supplemental informa-
tion by calling 1-888-738-3773 or visiting www.financialfreedom.
com). The company was founded in 1996 and is owned by IndyMac
Bank, a nationwide mortgage lender. It’s natural to be a little sus-
pect of a company whose name you may not recognize and isn’t
backed by government programs, but rest assured that Financial
Freedom is a deep-seeded corporation that’s here to stay. They
have a vested interest in reverse mortgage loans, are active in the
National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, and pride them-
selves on being one of the largest reverse mortgage lenders in the
country. There are other companies who offer these loans, but so
far they only originate in a few of the larger states.
Financial Freedom actually has the capacity to fund all kinds of
reverse mortgages, but the Jumbo Cash Account is their pride and
joy. You’d have pride and joy too if you could afford to lend some-
one a couple million dollars.
The founders of Financial Freedom know that this is a big decision,
and want to make sure that you feel absolutely confident in their
practices. After all, they’re asking you to put your financial future
(via your home’s equity) in their hands. They have created a six-
step “consumer safeguard” system to ensure that every borrower
is protected from what the industry calls predatory lending (origi-
nating loans that are not in the borrower’s best interest for the 
purpose of making more money) and gets an objective, honest
assessment of their financial situation. The program consists of:
1. Requiring originators to give every borrower a document
(made by Financial Freedom) that clearly shows all of their
reverse mortgage options.
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
104

2. Encouraging any of the borrower’s personal advisors —
whether friends, family, lawyers, or others — to attend
meetings with the originator.
3. Using HUD-approved and other “specially trained” coun-
selors to meet with the borrower before filling out any final
applications.
4. Reviewing the loan program and product choice with a
regional processing center before the application is sent to
the underwriters.
5. Conducting a secondary review at the underwriting center.
6. Sending a customer-satisfaction survey to all borrowers to
make certain that everything went as smoothly and easily
as possible.
Once you and your counselor choose a Financial Freedom loan,
you may consider going to a correspondent lender, an originator
who is affiliated with the company. Their originators are trained in
all aspects of reverse mortgage lending, but will be especially
knowledgeable on the Cash Account options. They will have sup-
port from Financial Freedom’s training and product literature
sources and are held to the company’s standards.
It’s only fair to say, however, that most — if not all — approved
reverse mortgage originators (and you should only ever go to an
approved originator) have similar rigorous standards that they
adhere to. Any member of the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders
Association (NRMLA) will be held to strict codes of conduct.
Understanding Cash Accounts
Jumbo Cash Accounts figure your loan amount just like the other
reverse mortgage products: by primarily considering the value of
your home and your (and any other borrower’s) age. And, like
other reverse mortgages, the loan won’t be due until you move out
of the home permanently.
A Cash Account works like a line of credit: The total amount you
will borrow (your principal amount) sits in an intangible “account”
(literally the equity in your home), which you can access at any
time like a bank account.
The Financial Freedom Cash Account is a jumbo loan, which 
means you’re going to get a lot more out of the equity in your high-
priced home. Jumbo loans start where traditional loans leave off.
Generally speaking, homes worth more than $359,650 (the Fannie
Chapter 7: Jumping into Jumbo Cash Accounts 105

Mae maximum; see Chapter 6) will get the best deal from these
expanded loans, and the more your home is worth, the better
you’ll make out. 
If you’ve done the math on the HECM (see Chapter 5) and Home
Keeper loans (see Chapter 6) and discovered that you won’t be
able to borrow nearly what you imagined your could, take heart.
With the Jumbo Cash Account, you’ll be pleased to see what a
huge difference this loan can make. For example, the principal loan
amount for a Jumbo Cash Account for a 66-year-old borrower with
a home valued at $1,500,000 and no outstanding mortgage debts
would be $290,550, as compared to an HECM ($166,474) or Home
Keeper loan ($62,956).
As you can see, Annie will get a lot more bang for her buck with 
a Jumbo Cash Account than she would with either of her other
options — almost twice as much as the HECM offers, and nearly
five times as much as with Fannie Mae’s Home Keeper. If she waits
a few years to get her loan, Annie will receive even more money
since the older you are, the more money a reverse mortgage com-
pany lends you.
However, not all loans are created equal. Almost anyone can get a
Cash Account, but people with moderately priced homes will prob-
ably get a better value out of HECM or Home Keeper loans (but
more often HECM). Or you may find that you’re better off with an
alternative, such as selling your home or getting another forward
mortgage (see Chapter 8 for more on alternative options). For
example, the principal loan amount for a Jumbo Cash Account for
a 66-year-old borrower who owns a $545,000 home and owes noth-
ing on a previous mortgage would be $101,631, but it would be
$162,942 with an HECM and just $62,956 with the Home Keeper,
making the HECM the clear winner in this example.
Clearly this borrower would get a greater benefit from an HECM
than the Jumbo Cash Account, even though his home is valued
above the HECM lending limits ($290,319 in high-cost areas). 
Unfortunately, there’s no magic age or home value where it becomes
obvious which loan option to take. It would be impossible to say
that everyone over a certain age would get the most out of a
Jumbo Cash Account, or that anyone under a certain home value
would benefit more from an HECM. Your counselor will be able to
show you what you can expect from each loan option and help you
weigh the pros and cons of each.

Withdrawing your equity
Other reverse mortgages have payment options that let you choose
your preferred cash vehicle: monthly checks, a lump sum, or a line
of credit (see Chapters 4 and 5). Financial Freedom operates on a
different payment system — it doesn’t offer monthly payments,
just a line of credit. Plus, most of its programs require that you
take out a minimum of $500 per withdrawal. If you can set a sched-
ule for yourself (for instance, on the first of every month you take
out your minimum withdrawal), you can think of it as a $500
monthly payment. If you need more, you can add to that withdrawal,
or take out another $500 as you need it. 
In fact, there are several great features to the withdrawal system 
of Jumbo Cash Accounts. We describe those features in the follow-
ing list:
 Withdrawing flexibility: For example, if in August you’ve
decided that you only needed the minimum for daily living —
groceries, paying the housekeeper, a few dinners out — you
only withdraw $500. But in September you know you’re going
on a cruise and will need more for “fun money.” You can take
out as much as you think you’ll need (don’t forget to factor in
presents for the grandkids) and save any leftovers in your per-
sonal bank account. 
What if you’ve already taken out a withdrawal this month and
two weeks later your refrigerator breaks down? Simply take
out another withdrawal. It’s really that easy. You can even skip
months if you don’t need the money right away. With a line of
credit you have complete freedom to get, spend, and enjoy
your money whenever and however you like. It’s all up to you.
This, of course means that you have to exercise a certain
degree of responsibility. It’s very tempting to spend your
money as soon as you get it, even for those accustomed to
having access to seemingly endless supplies of money. Go
ahead and take that trip, remodel your master bath, buy a
deluxe mini-mansion for your dog, but make sure you’ll have
Chapter 7: Jumping into Jumbo Cash Accounts 107

enough left over for the life of your loan (or however long you
expect to need it). Following are some ways you can make
sure you have money when you need it:
• Create a budget for yourself. Be honest about the stan-
dard of living you expect to keep in the next decade or
so. Some borrowers don’t actually need their Cash
Account on a daily basis — they just want it for a sense
of added security, or perhaps to help with a large
expense that they expect in the future. If that describes
you, this could be the perfect reverse mortgage for your
lifestyle. If not, take a serious look at your finances over
the past year and make sure that a Jumbo Cash Account
will be able to meet your expectations. 
• Estimate how long you plan to keep the loan. When
Financial Freedom determines how much to lend you,
they estimate how long you’ll keep the loan — you need
to do the same thing. If they lend you $400,000 on a
seven-year loan and you spend $350,000 on a new 64-foot
boat and matching sailor outfits the next day, you’re
only left with $50,000 for (approximately) the next seven
years. If you break it down, that’s only about $600 a
month, which isn’t going to go very far when you’ve got
a new boat and all those dock parties to keep up with.
Plus, if you end up spreading out the loan for longer
than seven years, that monthly allotment is going to
shrink by about $100 per month for every extra year you
have the loan. Take a look at Chapter 2 for tips on creat-
ing a budget and determining how much you’ll need
from month to month.
 Paying back with no prepayment penalty: One of the most
innovative features of the Financial Freedom withdrawal
system is that you have the option to pay back your loan as
you go with no prepayment penalty, which means that you
can take out $1,000 one day and deposit $500 the next. You
can then reborrow that money . . . it’s like recycling! The only
rules are that you can’t pay back more than you’ve borrowed
(and what would be the point?), and if you pay back the entire
loan, your loan is usually considered over, which means you
can’t borrow any more money from your account.
It’s in your best interest, however, to only withdraw as much
as you’ll need (after the minimum $500). In fact, it’s literally in
your best interest, because your cash account will grow by a
rate of 5 percent per year — that’s more than you’ll earn on
even the best CD or savings accounts. That 5 percent only
grows on the amount left to borrow, so whatever you have in
your hands isn’t growing.
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
108

The growth in your line of credit is compounding, which means
it’s similar to an interest-bearing savings account where you
earn interest on your interest. If you have $200,000 available
in your line of credit and you don’t touch it, the first time it
compounds it will increase by 5 percent ($10,000). If you don’t
touch any of that money, the next time it compounds the
increase would be 5 percent of $210,000.
Qualifying for a Jumbo 
Cash Account
You’ll find that loan qualifications for the Jumbo Cash Account are
a little different than the other two loan products identified in
Chapters 4 and 5. There are more restrictions in some senses, 
and more freedom in others. If your home didn’t qualify for either
of the other loans, the Jumbo Cash Account may be a pleasant 
surprise. 
Loaning in the Lone Star State
Wealthy oil tycoons in Texas, you can stop reading this chapter
right now. We’re sorry to report that your state does not allow
lines of credit, even for reverse mortgages. They do, however, allow
monthly or lump-sum payments, so turn back to Chapters 4 and 5
and take a moment to reconsider the HECM or Home Keeper loan. 
You also have several options available to you that don’t involve
reverse mortgages at all. If you absolutely must have more money
than either of those plans can offer, you may want to consider sell-
ing your home and moving to a lower-cost area. You can also refi-
nance or take out a Home Equity Line of Credit. For more on
additional options, skip ahead to Chapter 8. You may find an alter-
native that makes you happier than an armadillo in a patch of
Texas Bluebonnets.
Checking out eligibility
Now, for everyone in America’s 49 other states (if you’re from
Texas, see the previous section, “Loaning in the Lone Star State”),
most of the Financial Freedom eligibility requirements are just the
same as the other reverse mortgage products. You must:
 Be at least 62 years old
 Be a homeowner with at least some equity in your home
Chapter 7: Jumping into Jumbo Cash Accounts 109

 Live in your home full time
 Meet with an approved counselor
Eligible home types are much more lenient with the Financial
Freedom products, so chances are that if you meet the above
requirements, you’ll be able to get a Financial Freedom loan.
Borrowers must live in either:
 A single-family home (a detached property)
 Manufactured home (and own the property)
 Condominium
 Planned unit development (PUD)
 one- to four-unit rental property (as long as you are the owner
of the entire property and live in one of the units)
 Co-op (only available in the state of New York) 
Your home must also be valued at a minimum of $75,000. Financial
Freedom states that there are “virtually” no upper limits, which is
merely a protection against someone trying to take out a loan for
$50 million on their central California castle. But they will fund just
about any reasonable loan. 
It’s not uncommon to see a Jumbo Cash Account on a multimillion
dollar home, but if you’re still not convinced that your palace will
qualify, give Financial Freedom a call at 1-888-REVERSE (888-738-3773)
and ask them to tell you what the home value was on their largest
ever loan to date. As long as you have them on the phone, ask
them about their products and request an informational packet.
They can also put you in touch with an originator in your area, or
send you a list of Financial Freedom specialists.
Taking an Interest in London
You knew there had to be a downside, right? Here’s the Jumbo Cash
Account’s greatest downfall: higher interest rates. The good news
is that like all reverse mortgage products, you are only charged
interest on the amount you’ve borrowed. Since it’s up to you how
much you take out, you control how much of your money is charged.
Financial Freedom uses the six-month London Inter Bank Offered
Rate (LIBOR) as their index (the basis for their interest rate). The
LIBOR is the rate at which banks lend money to each other in
London, England. Despite being a British index, it’s actually used
quite commonly in American exchanges. One of its benefits is that
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
110

the LIBOR usually only changes slightly from period to period.
Since your rate will be charged on the six-month LIBOR, the index
has six full months to go up or down before the monthly averages
are pooled to affect your rate.
The LIBOR index can be found in the Wall Street Journal, along with
most other interest rate indexes. Pick up a copy to see where rates
are — if nothing else, just think how smart you’ll look reading the
Wall Street Journal!
Financial Freedom adds a margin (the maximum percentage that a
originator can add) to the LIBOR index to create your interest rate.
However, Financial Freedom offers a lower six-month introductory
rate to new borrowers. For the first six months of your loan, your
interest rate will be the LIBOR plus a margin of 4.50 percent. After
that point, the margin jumps up to a full 5.00 percent. 
If the LIBOR is at 2.10 percent, and we assume that it goes up by
about 0.50 percent (to 2.60 percent) after six months, your intro-
ductory rate, which adds a 4.50-percent margin to the LIBOR,
would be 6.60 percent (2.10 percent + 4.50 percent), and after six
months, the interest rate would be 7.60 percent (2.60 percent +
5.00 percent).
Financial Freedom caps the interest rate at 6 percent over the origi-
nal rate. If you got a Jumbo Cash Account loan today at a rate of
6.5 percent, the most it could ever be is 12.50 percent, no matter
what the rest of the world is paying. 
Because the LIBOR is a six-month term, your interest only adjusts
every six months (semi-annually). This can be good news if mar-
kets are slowly changing, since you have six whole months to let
the markets go down. This is bad news, however, if you’re used to
a rate of 7.20 percent and suddenly jump to 8.50 percent. But as
we’ve said before, don’t let interest rates bog you down too much.
When you play the stock market you have to allow a few years to
let it all settle so that you come out on top. In the same vein, inter-
est rates are constantly up and down, so worry more about how
you’ll enjoy your money and less about interest.
Paying for Splendor
The Cash Account is considered one of the most expensive loans
out there because of its origination fees. The upside is that you can
usually borrow more with the Cash Account than with other loans,
so you simply have to decide which is more important to you:
more money to spend now or less money to spend later.
Chapter 7: Jumping into Jumbo Cash Accounts 111

 Varying origination fees: Financial Freedom’s standard fee is
up to 2 percent of your home value for the first $500,000. Any
part of the next $500,000 adds a 1.5 percent fee, and anything
over $1,000,000 is an additional 1 percent. 
For example, a $600,000 home would fetch $10,000 in fees for
the first $500,000 and $1,500 for that remaining $100,000, giving
the originator a grand total of $11,500 in fees. A $1,700,000
home would cost you $10,000 for the first $500,000; $7,500 
for the next $500,000; and $7,000 for the last $700,000 of your
home’s value, for a total origination fee of $24,500. 
 $20 for a credit report: Originators use the information from
your credit report to determine whether or not you have any
outstanding federal tax liens (if, for instance, you didn’t pay
your taxes and the government has a claim on your home) or
other judgments. You will most likely already know if you have
outstanding debts, but a credit report keeps everything on the
“up and up.”
 $20 for flood certification: If you live on a federally desig-
nated flood plane, insurance and repair costs may affect your
loan. If you live in an area like this, you would have had to
have a similar certification on your previous loan.
 $50 for a courier: Just as it sounds, this is what the originator
charges you to cover the costs of mailing things with regards
to your loan. It’s so costly because they send everything by
overnight mail so your loan is processed quickly.
 $50–$100 for recording: Your county needs accurate informa-
tion about all housing-related information, including Deeds of
Trust and mortgages. Every loan (also referred to here as a
mortgage lien) must be recorded at your County Recorder’s
office, and this fee covers the charge to do so. 
 $75–$150 for document preparation: This is really an arbi-
trary service fee, because it doesn’t actually cost a specific
dollar amount to fill out paperwork, and it isn’t based on a
per-page or per-hour system. Some originators outsource this
work and may charge you exactly what that firm charges
them. Others rely on an in-house processor to do it, who gets
a salary that has nothing to do with this fee. Either way, it’s a
relatively inexpensive service.
 $100 for pest inspection: Because your home has to be struc-
turally sound in order to receive the loan, pest inspectors will
be deployed to test your home for things like termites and
other destructive bugs. If they find a problem, your home will
be debugged and you may need a follow-up inspection. Some
charge a secondary fee for the follow-up inspection, and some
only charge you once.
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
112

 $400–$600 for closing/settlement: This fee covers the title
search and any incidentals associated with the closing of the
loan. The title search shows who is currently on the home’s
title (who legally owns the home) and whether there are any
outstanding liens on it, like past mortgages you have yet to
pay off.
 $250 for the survey: Six years ago, your neighbor built a
fence that was two feet over on your side of the property line
and you’ve been fighting about it ever since. Well, you’ll finally
get your justice. In some states, a surveyor will come to your
home and establish the official boundaries for your property.
Start practicing your “I told you so.”
 $300–$400 for an appraisal: As with all FHA loans, your home
must be in good condition before the loan can be approved.
The appraiser will check for structural defects (leaky roof,
cracked foundation, and water damage, among others), as
well as make sure the property is up to code. If not, you’ll
need to make the changes (completed by a certified contrac-
tor) and submit to a re-exam. Don’t worry if you can’t afford to
make the changes right away — the FHA thought of that, too.
These costs can be bundled into your total loan, giving you up
to one year to fix your home’s glitches.
 Varying fee for title insurance: Your fees will include title
insurance, which is designed to protect both you and the
lender. The cost depends on the size of your loan (the higher
the loan amount, the higher the title insurance premiums).
Usually your originator will arrange this for you. All you have
to do is sign on the dotted line.
 $20 per month for servicing fees: The servicing fee is a
monthly payment that covers everything the lender has to do
after they’ve closed the loan. It’s financed right into your loan,
so you won’t even have to think about it until the loan comes
due. If you live in Illinois or Maryland, you’ve lucked out:
Financial Freedom does not charge a servicing fee in your state.
Your originator will arrange most, if not all, of the third-party 
services for you, but you are responsible for each fee. 
Choosing Loan Options
There are three loan configurations available to you with a Financial
Freedom reverse mortgage. Each is similar, but one may have a fea-
ture that fits better into your financial goals. All Financial Freedom
loans have these six things in common:
Chapter 7: Jumping into Jumbo Cash Accounts 113

 Virtually no loan limit
 Six-month introductory interest rate of 4.50 percent above 
the LIBOR
 Lifetime interest rate cap of 5 percent above the LIBOR
 $20 servicing fee
 Eligible homes including single-family, condo, manufactured,
PUD, one to four unit (if you live in one unit), and co-ops (in
New York)
 Minimum home value of $75,000
But each of your options — the standard loan, Simply Zero, and
Zero Point — has its own particular characteristics. Your origina-
tor and counselor will be able to advise you on these choices, but
it helps to go in there knowing which option you think you’ll prefer.
Selecting the standard Cash Account
The standard Cash Account offers great features for most qualified
borrowers, but it also has its drawbacks — the standard loan is
actually the only Financial Freedom loan that charges an origina-
tion fee. Why would you choose a loan with fees if you could skip
them altogether? Because the standard loan has more flexibility
and fewer restrictions, making it an excellent choice for those who
want more control over their funds.
As we mention in “Withdrawing your equity” earlier in this chapter,
you have the option to repay your loan over time and, in theory,
reborrow that money again. This is what is called an open-ended
revolving line of credit, and it definitely works to your advantage.
You can truly take out as much money as you need (just shy of 
the total available) and replace it whenever you like. Using this
tool, you can all but pay off your loan in the timeframe that works
for you before it’s even due, leaving little for your heirs to deal
with if you move out, or upon your death.
Another benefit is that you can withdraw your money in any amount
over $500 at any time. This means that if you didn’t actually need
your money right away, you wouldn’t have to receive any payments
until you were ready. Instead of being tempted with a pile of cash
that you can’t really think of a practical use for (unless you con-
sider champagne fountains “practical”), you can leave your money
where it is while it quietly grows by 5 percent each year. 
Part II: Going Shopping: Product Options 
114

The standard option is a good choice for those who want flexibility
with their loan and aren’t necessarily getting a reverse mortgage to
pay for a large purchase in the very near future. Although you cer-
tainly could use this loan for that purpose, you’d be better off with
one of the following loans to help pay for a looming high-ticket
expense.
Selecting the Zero Point option
The Zero Point option is appealing to many seniors because it
charges no up-front origination fees. When you consider how much
you’ll spend on fees with a standard loan, this is often a great alter-
native for those who are watching every penny.
Don’t let that fool you: You still have closing costs to consider that
are involved with the Zero Point loan. You will still pay for all of the
regular closing services, but they are fortunately capped at $3,500.
Since closing costs for homes of “jumbo” value usually come out to
over $4,000, you’re saving $500 right off the bat.
However, whatever you’re saving in origination and closing costs
will probably be eaten up by interest charged on your balance. No
matter how much you’re borrowing with your Jumbo Cash Account
or how much you actually intend to spend, the Zero Point loan
requires you to withdraw 75 percent of your total available funds
at closing. For example, if you had a principal amount of $200,000,
you would walk away with a cool $150,000 check. This can work
out well for you if you have a large expense coming up, but it defi-
nitely works out well for Financial Freedom because they begin 
collecting interest on all of that money from day one. You will still
earn a 5 percent annual growth rate on any leftover money, just
like you would with a standard Financial Freedom loan, but it won’t
be as significant of an increase because it would be growing on a
reduced scale. After the first big withdrawal, you must take out a
minimum of $500 any time you need to draw on that account again.
It’s also important to consider that the Zero Point option doesn’t
let you repay any of your balance for the first five years. Many
people like the sense of security they get from paying off their loan
as they go (especially with jumbo loans) because the more you
repay now, the less you (or your heirs) will owe later. Repayment
certainly isn’t a requirement, however, so this is only a shortcom-
ing if you feel strongly about “paying down” your balance.
Chapter 7: Jumping into Jumbo Cash Accounts 115

The Zero Point option is best for people who need their reverse
mortgage money for a specific purpose, or who feel comfortable
handling their funds so that they will last for the next several
years.
Checking out the Simply Zero option
The newest member of the Financial Freedom family is the Simply
Zero option, unveiled in summer 2004. Since it became available,
the Simply Zero loan has been a very popular choice for the jumbo
loan borrower. When Financial Freedom says “Simply Zero,” they
mean simply zero. You will pay no origination fees (which saves
you the equivalent of 2 percent of your home’s value), nor will you
pay any closing costs, which can easily top out around $4,000
depending on where you live. You will pay any state or local taxes
of course, but as far as Financial Freedom is concerned, you don’t
owe them one red cent in fees or closing costs. 
The concept of Simply Zero extends even further, requiring you to
withdraw 100 percent of your loan (your principal) when it closes,
which leaves you with simply zero dollars in your available funds.
If you plan to get a reverse mortgage in order to pay for something
immediately (like starting a small business or an upcoming medical
procedure) then the idea of getting a check for a $100,000 or so
makes perfect sense. Other investments can be a good choice, as
long as you will earn at least 5 percent (the amount you’d earn
with a standard loan on your unused funds). However, if you don’t
need the full amount right away, the standard loan is probably
your best bet.
If you don’t trust yourself to spread the money out for your
remaining golden years, but you feel that Simply Zero is the best
option for you, you may be able to have a friend, relative, or finan-
cial planner help you portion it out. A good resource for help with
managing your finances (especially a huge chunk of change like
this one) is Personal Finance For Dummies.
Simply Zero has the same “no prepayment for the first 5 years”
rule that the Zero Point option has, so keep that fact in mind when
choosing your loan.

Part III 
Taking the Plunge

In this part . . .
O
nce you’ve decided on a loan that may work for you
(see the Chapters in Part II), Part III ushers you into
the next steps. We include lots of great tips (if we do say
so ourselves) to equip you so there are no surprises as
you take each step of the reverse mortgage process on
your own. 
Chapter 8, the ﬁrst step, gives you the scoop on arranging
a meeting with a reverse mortgage counselor, what to
expect during the visit, and what you can do to make the
meeting go smoothly.
Chapter 9 covers the procedure of choosing an originator,
applying for a loan, and the loan approval process.
Getting your home appraised may be a familiar experience,
but Chapter 10 gives you some tips from reverse mortgage
originators on how to make a good impression, and how
to boost your home’s value.
Last but not least, Chapter 11 gives an overview of the
closing process. This is the part where you sign those last
documents and get your ﬁrst check, so we give you all the
info you need to make it hassle-free.

any people hear the word “counselor” and instantly think of
laying uncomfortably on a big leather couch while someone
asks about your mother. In fact, the reverse mortgage counselor is
nothing of the sort. You can think of them more like a school coun-
selor: Instead of helping you pick your classes, they help you pick
your loan. Plus, like a school counselor, their services are free. You
don’t have to pay one cent for your session.
Counselors are unbiased (they have absolutely no stake in whether
or not you get a reverse mortgage), completely confidential, and
are only looking out for your best interests. Everyone who wants a
reverse mortgage is required (yes, this means you) to visit a coun-
selor prior to getting their loan. We identify ways in this chapter to
find a reverse mortgage counselor, things to look for when choos-
ing one, and examples of some options they may give you in lieu of
a reverse mortgage.
Finding a Counselor
The easiest way to find a counselor by far is to go online. There are
a few counselor listings, but you can save yourself time by going
straight to www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hecm/hecmlist.
cfm. If you’re uncomfortable with computers, just ask a friend or
family member to guide you, or use the computers at your local

library (they’re always willing to lend a hand). You can also call 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at
800-569-4287 for counselors near you.
Another easy way to find a counselor is to simply ask your origina-
tor (Chapter 9). They know who’s out there and who can help.
Until recently, originators were not allowed to recommend coun-
selors. In 2005, regulations changed to allow originators to give
you a list of five counseling agencies in your state.
Don’t despair if you don’t see a counselor in your area. While they
certainly prefer to spend an hour with you in person, counselors
will also conduct phone meetings. It may take a little longer —
probably two or three calls — but it’s worth the time if there aren’t
any counselors near you, or you are unable to get to their offices. If
you live in a less-populous state or rural area, there may only be a
handful of counselors around, so a phone meeting may be in your
future.
Before you can go see a counselor, you must request counseling —
they don’t let just anyone take up their time! The application
simply verifies that you are actually eligible for a reverse mortgage
and that you understand the basics. They won’t turn you away
unless you are underage (when’s the last time you were carded for
anything?) or do not show sufficient comprehension. This is very
rare, so don’t worry. Anyone who is reading this sentence and is
over 62 is likely to be eligible.
If you just want to speak to a counselor but aren’t ready to set up
an appointment, you may be able to get a counselor on the phone
to answer a quick question or two. This is also a good opportunity
to feel them out to see if you will be compatible.
Here are some great picks for finding counselors:
 HUD counselors: No matter which loan you think you want,
we recommend visiting a HUD-approved counselor. Although
it’s HUD that offers one of the loan options (the Home Equity
Conversion Mortgage, or HECM), their counselors have under-
gone extensive training and are virtually guaranteed to be the
best in the business. 
Most HUD counselors are paid through a government grant.
They get a dollar amount based on how many counseling ses-
sions they’ve held. That’s why almost all HUD counselors are
free — be sure to ask if they charge a fee before you visit. If
they do, find a different counselor. Costs are usually around
$75 — it’s up to you whether or not it’s worth it to spend that
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
122

money, but it’s usually unnecessary. You don’t get a better
counselor for a fee, and there’s no reason for you to pay. 
The best place to find a HUD counselor is at, you guessed it,
the HUD Web site. Follow this string of letters to an easy-to-
navigate site: www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hecm/
hecmlist.cfm. Then just click on your state and you’ll find a
whole slew of information about the counselors in your state.
Take some time to read through the list, visit their individual
Web sites, and narrow it down to one or two. You can also call
800-569-4287 and ask for a reverse mortgage counselor in your
area.
 National Center for Home Equity Conversion’s (NCHEC)
“preferred” counselors: These are counselors who work for
non-profit or public agencies and have all the same detailed
information and unbiased policies that HUD counselors have.
You can find an NCHEC counselor by visiting www.reverse.
org. Take your time and explore this site — they are a virtual
“wealth” of information.
 The AARP network: If you want to go one step up from these
very qualified professionals, the AARP Foundation (affiliated
with AARP but not the main organization) created a counselor
network with the best of the best HUD-approved counselors in
the country. These counselors scored the highest on a test
administered by AARP’s Reverse Mortgage Project, and they
must operate in keeping with the project’s policies and stan-
dards. There are only about 90 in the whole country, but
they’re spread out, so you should be able to find one in your
state.
Aside from scoring high on their AARP exam, network coun-
selors are an actual network of counselors (it’s not just a
fancy title). Every week, all of the network counselors hold a
conference call where they share recent experiences, help
each other troubleshoot, and discuss ways to make the net-
work’s counseling sessions consistent from Washington to
Florida and everywhere in between. They also keep up-to-date
on any changes in the loan products, financial regulations,
and eligibility requirements. 
To find a certified AARP Project counselor, start at www.
hecmresources.org/requests.cfm. On the left-hand side,
click on “USA Map” and then click on your state. You’ll see a
brief explanation of services, and then a table of all the Reverse
Mortgage Project “network” counselors listed by city. You can
also call 800-209-8085 and ask for information about reverse
mortgage counseling.
Chapter 8: Taking the First Step: Seeing a Counselor 123

For those who know without a doubt that they will need a Jumbo
Cash Account (your home is worth around a $1,000,000 or more)
counseling is required as well. The counseling on the Cash Account
program will be done during the time your application is being
processed. Your originator requests that an independent third
party counselor calls you to go over the program. This counselor
may be HUD approved, but not always — it’s worth it to check
(you can always request a HUD counselor from your originator as
well). The counselor will review the disclosure forms you were pro-
vided at the time of application to ensure that you understand all
the aspects of the loan (have a look at Chapter 9 for more on appli-
cation forms). If after the counseling session you feel you need
more input, you may seek additional advice from a financial profes-
sional of your choice, such as a financial advisor, senior attorney,
or a CPA. 
Knowing What to Expect
The reverse mortgage counselor’s job is to help you find the right
loan or alternative for your individual situation. That’s it. They
don’t originate, fund, or process the loan. Counselors just help you
choose it.
As a matter of fact, counselors are supposed to:
 Assist you in making a decision on your own.
 Keep their opinions to themselves when it comes to your
personal decisions. If they ask what you want to do with your
reverse mortgage money and you reply, “I’m going to open a
brothel,” the counselor’s next question should be, “Will you
need a line of credit or a lump sum?” While they may not
agree with your choices, their job isn’t to impart judgment 
on you.
 Keep your session confidential. This means that if you don’t
want your family present and they call up the counselor
demanding to know what went on, all he or she will ever say
is, “sorry, that’s confidential.” The only time this may not be
the case is if the counselor determines that you are not quite
lucid, or if you have given your permission to tell certain
people what you’ve decided. 
 Know the options inside and out and get enough informa-
tion from you in your hour-long session. Counselors are
good, but they’re not psychic; when you come, come pre-
pared. You need to have a few things ready to discuss before
you make your first appointment:
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
124

• Make sure that you are eligible (Chapter 3).
• Develop a basic idea of the loan options and how the
reverse mortgage works (see Chapters 5, 6, and 7).
• Get a sense of your finances (how much you owe in
monthly debts, how much you think you’ll need per
month, and so on; see Chapter 2).
• Know approximately what your home is worth (ask
neighbors who recently sold their homes, or look in the
newspaper for homes listed in your area).
Coming prepared makes the counselor’s job easier and gets you
out of there faster.
When you meet with your counselor, you may be surprised to find
that some of the options suggested to you don’t involve reverse
mortgages at all. That’s because counselors are required to weigh
all of your options and make you aware of every viable, practical
choice so you can take an active part in selecting your loan. They
are experts on lots of senior services and programs, and may know
of one that would cost you less, or get you more.
While all counselors operate a little differently, most will follow a
basic four-part counseling session: making the appointment, dis-
cussing your motivations and needs, understanding the options,
and getting your certificate. You’ll find a discussion for all of those
parts in the sections that follow.
Making the appointment
It may seem like a no-brainer, but there are some guidelines for
making your counseling appointment. First, you need to determine
whether you will do your session in person or over the phone.
Most counselors prefer meeting in their office, but if a phone meet-
ing is necessary due to distance or immobility, they will happily
hold a phone session.
The person who needs the reverse mortgage is the only person who
can make the appointment. That means that if you feel a little tired
and would rather your daughter called for you, she’ll have to do a
darn good impression of you to set up your session. Counselors want
to know ahead of time who they will be in contact with, and what
sort of mental capacity you’re in. If you can’t make a phone call to
schedule a meeting, chances are you aren’t fit to take out a new
mortgage. Of course, family members are encouraged to join in on
the sessions, but only the borrower can make the appointment.
Chapter 8: Taking the First Step: Seeing a Counselor 125

Discussing your needs
Some counselors do an initial phone “interview” with you and send
you all the necessary handouts and packets before your session 
so you have a chance to look them over. Others prefer to go over
everything in person so they can get a full sense of your situation,
face to face. Both ways give them the information they need, so it
comes down to what you and your counselor can agree on.
Once you’re inside the counselor’s office (or on the phone) your
counselor explains his or her role to you and then asks you about
your motivations for investigating a reverse mortgage. Questions
(that you should have some ready answers to) may include:
 Why do you want a reverse mortgage?
 What do you plan to do with the money?
 How long do you expect to stay in your home?
 How much money do you actually need?
 Do you have any outstanding debts, and if so, how much?
 Does your home need repairs that you know of?
 How much (if any) of your estate do you want to leave to 
your heirs?
Start thinking about the answers to these questions now, and your
counseling session can go a lot smoother (and faster).
If the questions sound invasive or make you feel defensive about
your finances, take a deep breath and remember that the coun-
selor has to know everything about your living situation to help
you decide on the best loan for you. If you hold back information
(or worse, lie about something) you may be sent down the wrong
path . . . and that’s not a place you want to be when you have your
home on the line.
Your counselor will also try to assess your comprehension. It’s not
a test, and you don’t need to start popping ginseng just to appear
sharp in front of your counselor. Most seniors seeking reverse
mortgages are of sound mind, but some face dementia, stroke, or
Alzheimer’s, which may require a durable power of attorney to be
present. Still others may have a language barrier, making it difficult
to explain complex lending terms (although many counseling agen-
cies are jumping on the bilingual bandwagon). If you have hearing
or eyesight problems, let your counselor know ahead of time. None
of these issues are anything to be ashamed of, but it does help
your counselor to be aware before you arrive.
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
126

Your counselor also won’t expect you to be an expert on reverse
mortgages. It helps if you know the gist of it, but counselors take
the time to explain the whole kit and caboodle during their sessions.
At the end of your session, you will receive a HUD Certificate of
HECM Counseling. The certificate essentially proves that you
showed up at your counseling session, and that your counselor
has disclosed all of the information required. It also shows how
you held the sessions (by phone or in person) and how long, to the
minute, you spent with your counselor. The HUD certificate (by far
the most common, although non-HUD counselors may have varia-
tions) has six discussion items that your counselor should have
gone over with you prior to you signing the certificate.
1. They must tell you about other options besides the HECM
(HUD’s loan), including other living arrangements, social
services, health benefits, and financial options.
2. They must consider other loan programs and let you know
that they’re available. These may be other reverse mort-
gages, deferred payment loans, or property tax deferral.
3. They have to fully explain the monetary implications of 
getting a reverse mortgage.
4. They must disclose that reverse mortgages may affect your
taxes, eligibility for assistance under government programs,
or have an impact on your estate.
5. They must talk about whether you signed an agreement
with an estate planning service or other firm that requires,
or seems to require, that you pay a fee upon closing that
may exceed legal amounts.
6. If you did sign an agreement like this, that you understand
there are free resources available to you making that firm
unnecessary.
If you still have any questions about any of these items, this is the
time to ask — before you sign. Your signature (along with your
counselor’s) is required on the certificate. The counselor will prob-
ably ask you to sign three original (not photocopied) certificates.
One is for the counselor, one is for you to keep, and one is for your
originator. You’ll need to bring the originator’s copy with you to
your first meeting with the originator. If your originator loses it
(seriously, it happens), you can hand over the one you kept at home
for just such an occasion, or ask your counselor for a new one.
You’ll also see a note on the certificate that it’s only good for 180
days. If you plan to speak to an originator, do it fairly soon so you
don’t have to go through the counseling process all over again. 
Chapter 8: Taking the First Step: Seeing a Counselor 127

Understanding your options
When he or she has a good assessment of your finances and expec-
tations, your counselor will create computer printouts of all of
your options, based on the information you’ve given. This boils
down to a tangible summary of all your options with information
on which may work best for you. This is often called a Personal
Reverse Mortgage Analysis, and it’s a great tool to take back to your
family (if they didn’t come along) to show them exactly what your
choices are. 
The counselor can tweak the printouts to reflect any number of dif-
ferent options and show you how an endless combination of loans
will suit your needs. Hopefully, he or she will have such a good
reading on you (because you will have been so open) that the first
couple of choices will be options that you can agree on.
This is one reason why counselors prefer office sessions rather
than speaking over the phone. In the office, they can keep printing
out new choices as long as you keep changing your mind. Over the
phone they’ll have to help you agree on one to try, mail you the
printout, call to go over each line, and then do it all over again if
you want to see another option. In the office this can take minutes.
Over the phone it could be days before you reached a satisfying
loan option!
The printout will show what you can expect to receive — and 
give — with a particular option. It covers estimated loan costs,
interest rates, maximum fees, and approximate home value and
age, so what you see there should be close to what you’ll see in 
the originator’s office. 
Take these printouts home and review them after your counselor
has gone over them with you line by line. You don’t have to make 
a decision in the office, and they encourage you to call them again
if you have any follow-up questions. If you’re completely lost or
aren’t satisfied with your options, schedule another session. Most
people will only need to go once, but if you are utterly confused 
or don’t see an option that would work for you, make another
appointment. That’s what counselors are there for.
Once you and your counselor have established that a reverse
mortgage is right for you, he or she will most likely provide you
with a list of all the originators in your area. Counselors are not
allowed to favor or endorse any of them, and as tempting as it will
be to ask for a recommendation, it would be unethical for them to
give you one.
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
128

Bringing the Whole Gang
Counselors will almost always encourage you to bring people with
you to the counseling session. Some seniors are hesitant to discuss
their finances with their families. and although family, friends, or
professionals aren’t required to be at the session, their presence
can have a lot of benefits.
Including family and friends
The people closest to you can be a great help during this big finan-
cial decision. Their moral support and outside perspective can
make a huge difference in the way you perceive the whole loan
process. Here are some benefits to having your friends and family
accompany you:
 Family and friends can help you feel more at ease during
the counseling session and throughout the loan transaction.
 Family and friends can interpret confusing legal terms in a
way that a counselor may not.
 Your family and friends know you better than your coun-
selor ever could, and they may be able to see a glitch in a
particular program that you and your counselor have
missed. Maybe you donate $5,000 to your favorite charity
every year; this kind of spending will affect your bottom line
once you get a reverse mortgage, because they won’t have
factored that into your estimated monthly budget. 
 Your family and friends can advise whether you’ve been
entirely honest about your spending habits, which could
make a big difference in which payment schedule will work
for you.
 Your family can see how your financial decisions will affect
them. Family will be able to see how much of an inheritance
they can bank on and whether or not they will realistically be
able to keep your home. These days very few families feel the
need to keep their parent’s homes, since most seniors aren’t
living in the homes they raised their families in, but adult chil-
dren are sometimes reluctant to liquidate their parents’ home.
Bringing family to the counseling session allows everyone to
understand the most likely scenarios for your estate, based
on different loan options. 
Chapter 8: Taking the First Step: Seeing a Counselor 129

Using professionals
It may also be a good idea to bring along the financial or legal pro-
fessionals who oversee your accounts and/or your will. These may
be financial planners, family lawyers, elder law specialists, estate
planners, tax attorneys, or any other significant professional.
You may not be fully aware of where your money is or what your
money has been up to since you handed over your investments to
a financial planner. You may not realize what kind of tax benefits or
ramifications a reverse mortgage will have for you (sometimes it’s
a great tax saver, sometimes you’ll end up owing). You may learn
that you need to move some assets around to make this loan work
for you. Although your counselor knows the general rules and reg-
ulations related to these issues, your personal professionals proba-
bly know your financial history and goals better than a counselor
can glean in one short session.
Knowing what you’re doing with your home and your money will
also effect how they manage your finances. They may need to
change your investment portfolio drastically, or file your taxes in a
whole new way, simply because you got a reverse mortgage. 
At least two weeks in advance, let your financial professionals
know that you’ll be attending a counseling session and invite them
to come along. Provide them with some information about reverse
mortgages (you can even send them a copy of this book) so that
they have an understanding of the loan ahead of time and won’t
use up your meeting peppering the counselor with questions. Ask
them to come prepared with any financial documentation that may
help in your loan decision, like tax returns, home evaluations, or
investment records. By priming them for the session you can help
everyone get the most out of their presence. Some professionals
will charge you at their regular rate to attend your counseling ses-
sion. If you can, try to help them see that this is like a free crash
course in reverse mortgages for them. You or a family member may
be able to talk them down to coming for half price or even for free.
Use key terms like “business opportunity,” “growing market seg-
ment,” and “informational session” to get your point across. 
Knowing What to Look For
When you settle on a couple of choices for your counselor, keep
the following important points in mind:
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
130

 The counselor should be HUD-approved (see “Finding a
Counselor,” earlier in this chapter).
 The counselor must be objective and unbiased.
 The counselor must treat you with respect and keep all infor-
mation confidential.
 The counselor should not charge a fee (it is completely legal
for them to do so unless they are HUD-funded, but you can
probably find another counselor who’s free if that’s the case).
You can find out whether the counselors on your list meet these
requirements by simply giving them a call.
Exploring Other Options
Your counselor will give you many options based on your age,
home value, future plans, and monthly expenses. Whether some or
any of these will work for you can be discussed with your counselor.
Waiting it out
One of the most common reasons not to get a reverse mortgage is
age. When they made the minimum age 62, the reverse mortgage
bigwigs meant it in the truest sense of minimum. The very least
allowed. It’s a pretty standard retirement age — most people would
consider someone who’s 62 to be a senior. It doesn’t mean that the
day you turn 62 you need to run out and get a reverse mortgage. 
The older you are, the more you’ll get from any reverse mortgage
product. A big part of your loan amount is based on how much
longer the lenders think you’ll be living in your home. They will
have to pay a young person for a lot longer and handle a lot more
paperwork than they would for an older borrower. That’s why
older borrowers get better loan amounts. 
Your counselor may suggest that you wait a few more years to get
the most money out of your loan. Of course, if you have an immedi-
ate need or have foreseen the future and know that you won’t be
around in a few years, you and your counselor can discuss the
pros and cons to getting the loan early.
Thinking forward
Another option your counselor could have you consider is a forward
mortgage. Remember, a forward mortgage is just another term for
Chapter 8: Taking the First Step: Seeing a Counselor 131

a regular old traditional loan where you pay the bank instead of the
bank paying you. Why would you want to go back to paying off
another loan? Counselors sometimes suggest forward mortgages
for people who qualify for a reverse mortgage, but are on the
younger side of the spectrum, or who want to retain more control
of their income.
Home Equity Line of Credit
Many seniors who qualify for a reverse mortgage find themselves
happily married to people who don’t. The solution? Leave them
and start a new life with oodles of money, courtesy of your reverse
mortgage. Okay, if that sounds too drastic, your counselor may run
the numbers for you on a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), not
to be confused with Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM),
the reverse product (see Chapter 5). 
The HELOC is similar to a reverse mortgage in that you get to
spend the equity in your home today, but it differs in several cru-
cial ways. See Table 11-1 for a side-by-side comparison.

132

As you can see, the HELOC may be a less expensive route, but your
options are limited and your repayment is immediate. Your coun-
selor can show you how the numbers will add up for your individ-
ual circumstances.
ARMs
ARMs are adjustable rate mortgages, which means that the interest
rate changes far more frequently than it would with a traditional
forward mortgage. It also means that the loan terms are shorter.
It’s not uncommon to have a three, five, or seven year ARM. The
best part about ARM loans is that the rates are much lower . . .
often by a percentage point or two, which can add up fast. Most
ARM loans change interest rates every 6 or 12 months, but there
are some that do it every 3 months, or even once a month.
If you are old enough to qualify for a reverse mortgage but won’t
get as much money because you’re on the younger end of the spec-
trum, or if you only expect to be in your home for a few years, your
counselor will likely suggest that you refinance with an ARM. 
Because it’s a forward mortgage, you will still pay the lender (just
as you would for a regular 30-year mortgage), but your payments
will be much lower. The trouble with ARMs is that if rates go up, so
do your payments. Your counselor won’t try to predict the way
interest rates are turning. They really aren’t concerned with watch-
ing the indexes fluctuate. What they will do is help you assess the
risks involved with this option and allow you to decide for yourself
whether or not you are willing to assume the risk that your rates
will go shooting up.
Sharing your home 
Your financial situation may be such that you don’t need a huge
sum of money for any big vacation or fancy new bathroom. You
just need money for the essentials to supplement your Social
Security. Your counselor could bring up the idea of sharing a home
with a friend or relative in a similar situation. Do you have a sibling
or sewing club friend who is also in need of a little monthly help?
Invite them to live in your spare bedroom, charge them a fair rent,
and meet your monthly requirements.
In some cases, the best thing is for you to move in with an adult
child or other friend or relative. This won’t work in all families, 
but with a little compromise and a lot of love, it can be a good 
solution — maybe not ideal, but good. If you can afford it, you 
and your new roomies could get a lot out of a few sessions with a
family counselor (no relation to the reverse mortgage counselor).
Chapter 8: Taking the First Step: Seeing a Counselor 133

There you’ll have the chance to identify everyone’s needs, find out
what each person expects from this living situation, and work out
some of the kinks before you start feeling resentful that your kids
treat you like a live-in babysitter.
Checking out government loans
Your local or state government may have their own version of a
reverse mortgage available that is more in tune with your needs.
There are two species of state loans that you need to know about.
Your counselor will probably make you aware of these options if
they are appropriate to you and available in your area.
Using your equity
The most common state loans are generally called Deferred
Payment Loans (DPLs) but they may masquerade under other
names depending on your area. Essentially, they are just like any
other reverse mortgage — you will receive money based on the
equity in your home, which isn’t due until you permanently leave
your home. 
The state loans differ from the loan products featured in this book
in three significant ways. 
 The funds from DPLs can only be used for specific purposes,
and the purpose depends on the loan. They are, however,
almost always home-repair related. We’re not talking a fancy
new kitchen — these are necessary repairs or modifications,
like fixing your wiring or installing a roll-in shower. All three
loan products described in Chapters 5, 6, and 7 allow you 
to use your money for whatever you see fit, home repair or
otherwise.
 Interest charged on a DPL is usually fixed, which means that
the rate you get when you sign your loan documents is the
rate you’ll keep for the life of the loan. If you get your DPL
when rates are very low, this can be a tremendous benefit.
You may secure a 5.32 percent rate forever while others pay
8.97 a few years later. The downside is that if you lock in a
higher rate, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to refinance
and get a lower rate. The loans in the following chapters all
follow adjustable rates, which may change every month,
every six months, or annually. 
 DPL funds are only available in a lump sum; you get all of your
money in one very big check. This can be either a blessing or
a burden, depending on how you manage your money, what
you need the cash for, and what your interest rate is (since
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
134

the more you owe back at any given time, the more interest
you’re charged). Other reverse mortgages offer you a range of
choices for payment disbursement, which may or may not fit
your lifestyle better.
State loans like DPLs are sometimes harder to get, since eligibility
requirements tend to be more strict. In some areas they are limited
to those with very low income; in other areas they are dictated by
home value or the degree of your disability (if the loan is to be
used for disability modifications). 
It may sound like we’re being harsh on DPL loans. In fact, they can
be a great advantage for just the right borrower. They have a much
lower cost in the end than the loans in this book and usually don’t
charge origination fees, closing costs, mortgage insurance premi-
ums; they also have lower interest in most cases.
But we saved the best for last. In some areas, DPL loans are
dubbed forgivable loans because if you live in your home for a cer-
tain period of time (it will vary by state) you may not have to pay
back some or all of your loan. Your loan, or part of it, can be for-
given and you won’t have to repay it. Ever. It probably sounds too
good to be true, but many governments have set aside funds to aid
seniors in keeping their homes. Next time you curse your taxes,
think about the DPL. To find out if these loans are offered in your
area, ask your counselor or call your city/county housing depart-
ment. You may also find information with the area agency on aging
or state financing agency. Their phone numbers are located in your
phone book in the government pages. 
Paying the taxman
When money is tight, you have to make choices: pay your property
tax or keep your electricity running? Ok, your situation may not be
that dire, but you may have slipped up on your property tax at
some point, or it may be an obligation you suddenly can’t enter-
tain. This is a surprisingly common problem for seniors, so there’s
no need to feel ashamed if you fall into this category. For those
who find themselves indebted to their tax collector, your coun-
selor will probably suggest a Property Tax Deferral (PTD) loan.
Even good people get behind on their property tax. It won’t win
you any merit badges, but it’s not the end of the world in some
states. PTD loans will give you the money you need to pay off your
property taxes. But that’s all they do. You can’t use them for any
other purpose, period. You may have guessed from the name that
this is another deferred loan — you won’t have to pay off any of it
until you leave your home for good. 
Chapter 8: Taking the First Step: Seeing a Counselor 135

About half of the states in the United States offer PTD loans, and
each state has its own guidelines. You may find that two people
with identical ages, home values, income, and tax debt get com-
pletely different loans from state to state, or even county to
county. Two common requirements are that in most areas you
need to be at least 65, and have a low to moderate income. 
A big drawback to this loan is that it may not last as long as you
do. Whereas most reverse loans pay out as long as you live in your
home, the PTD can be capped in many programs. A major benefit
is that, like the DPL, the cost of the loan is negligible. You won’t
usually pay for any part except the principal (the actual amount
borrowed) and maybe a low closing cost.
One important note is that you can’t have a PTD loan and a reverse
mortgage at the same time. If you really only need the money to
pay off your property tax then by all means, pursue a PTD. But if
you think you’ll need additional funds, consider a reverse mort-
gage. Your counselor can help you compare the benefits of each.
You can find out if PTD loans are an option for you by contacting
the agency you pay your property tax to. If they don’t offer the
loan, ask if they offer an extension or lower-payment program.

Your Originator
In This Chapter
 Getting to know your originator
 Going through the process of originating the loan
 Checking out the processor and underwriter
 Searching for an originator
 Getting around predatory lenders
 Understanding your role in the origination process
You may have heard them called “loan officers,” “lenders,”
“originators,” or “mortgage planners,” but you may never
have known that these people are all one and the same. Despite
the abundance of different titles — making it all the more confusing
to look them up in the yellow pages — mortgage originators are
the middlemen and women who shop for the best rates and serv-
ice from lenders so you don’t have to. But let’s not oversimplify.
Originators are also the people who organize your entire loan from
start to finish and complete the necessary paperwork and various
tasks to ensure that your loan is the best loan it can be for you.
This chapter explores the details of the originator’s job, how to
find the best originator for your circumstances, and how to protect
yourself from those few nefarious “predatory” lenders.
Meeting Your Originator
This is the moment you’ve been waiting for since you opened this
book: meeting the person who can make all of your financial
dreams come true (or at least point you in the right direction). You
can choose to meet with an originator before or after meeting with
the required reverse mortgage counselor (see Chapter 8). We rec-
ommend that you meet with your counselor first for these reasons:

 If you go to your originator first, they’re just going to give you
a list of approved counselors and tell you to come back once
you’ve been through a counseling session. 
 The counselor will give you a better idea of which loan is the
right choice for you, and you can make your first originator
meeting go much more smoothly and quickly if you already
know what you want.
 Between the counselor and the information in this book, you
are going to walk into that originator’s office with confidence,
knowledge, and reasonable expectations — the originator will
be very impressed.
 You can also benefit by realizing what you can reasonably
anticipate and require from the originator.
Throughout your loan process, you may hear the terms lender and
originator used interchangeably. You’ll see servicing lenders men-
tioned as well (also called servicers). It can get a bit confusing, we
admit, so let’s break it down into two kinds of lenders: originating
lenders (we’ll call them Ollies for short) and servicing lenders (or
Sallies, just for fun).
Understanding originating lenders
The originating lender is the person that this chapter is devoted
to. Ollies can be called an originator or a lender, but it essentially
means the same thing: it’s the person who “makes” your loan. It is
not, however, the person who actually hands out the cash. The
originating lender is the person you go to once you’ve decided to
find more about how a reverse mortgage can work for you. The
originating lender is the one whose office you sit in for hours on
end, asking questions and signing papers.
Figuring out servicing lenders
On the other hand, you will never meet your servicing lender at all.
Your originating lender is required to give you all the contact infor-
mation you’d ever need in case you want to reach them, but
chances are good that Sally is a silent partner. 
You pay the servicing fees discussed in Chapters 5 through 7 to 
the — you guessed — servicing lender. For their fees, the servicing
lender agrees to:
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
138

 Send your checks (either monthly or when you request them,
depending on your loan type)
 Keep track of your loan balance and send you a statement 
regularly
 Handle the payment of your property taxes and homeowner’s
insurance straight from your account (if you want them to)
 Make sure you’re satisfying your end of the deal (still living in
the same home, maintaining the property, and paying taxes)
 Change your account information (such as how you want to
receive payments) at your whim
You may hear an originator referred to as a lender, but the ones
who write the checks are the real lenders — you’re borrowing their
money throughout the life of the loan. 
Although you won’t have much contact with theses companies, it’s
good to know whose body is attached to the hand that feeds you.
Ask your originator for an example of what your statements from
the servicer will look like, and make sure you leave there with the
servicer’s contact information.
Looking for the right stuff
Your originator is taking on a very serious role in your life: This
person can secure your financial future and guide you in making a
big life decision. Knowing what to look for before settling on an
originator is important because the right originator can make the
whole loan process much easier and stress-free. We give you a list
of tips on finding a good originator below:
 Look for an originator who is a member of the National
Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA) and HUD
approved. You should always do this, without exception. Not
only do these professionals have access to every scrap of
information, ongoing training, conventions, regulation updates,
and a network of their peers, NRMLA members must sign the
Code of Conduct as part of their application for membership.
A reverse mortgage originator doesn’t have to be a member of
NRMLA to get you a loan, but we strongly recommend that
you go with one who is. While membership isn’t a guaranty of
ethics, your chances of being taken advantage of by a senior
swindler are lower when you work with an NRMLA originator.
Chapter 9: Working on Step Two: Your Originator 139

 Look for a licensed originator. Once you’ve run down the list
of originators in your area and found the name of an NRMLA
member that looks good to you, call and ask if he or she is a
licensed originator. Originators do not need to be licensed in
all states, but it’s best if you can find one who is, regardless of
state requirements. They tend to have a higher standard of
ethics and will have undergone substantial training. Ask to 
see their certification — don’t be shy, they’ll be glad to show
it off.
When you go in to meet your originator for the first time, and all
throughout the process, keep the following points in mind:
 You need to be able to ask questions, sometimes the same
one several times, without your originator getting frustrated
or losing his patience. 
 You need someone who takes the time to explain every last
detail of the loan to you until you feel comfortable.
 You need to be treated with respect, dignity, and considera-
tion. Don’t work with anyone who condescends to you.
 If you feel you’re being pushed in a certain direction or that
the originator isn’t taking your opinion into account, find a
new originator. This person is probably more interested in
selling you a loan than helping to plan your financial future.
 Ask for a comparison chart of all the loan products available.
Every originator should have this handout ready.
 Find out how long the originator has been doing reverse mort-
gages. More experienced originators may be better prepared
for any little “snags” that come up along the way.
 Use your best judgment; only you know what’s best for you.
If your originator isn’t living up to these standards, find a new orig-
inator. Your money and future are too important to put in the
hands of someone you aren’t comfortable with. 
Originating the Loan
Originating a loan has three main parts:
 Taking the application and completing the paperwork
 Securing a loan from the lender
 Closing the loan
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
140

If the originator seems to be “passing” you along to an assistant or
processor, this is very common — don’t feel cast aside right away.
However, if you begin to feel that you’re not receiving the attention
you so greatly deserve, speak up. The originator may not even be
aware that you’re feeling put off. If, after that, you still aren’t get-
ting the personalized service you’re entitled to, it may be time to
look for another originator. 
Applying for your loan
Just as you had to apply for your forward mortgage, reverse mort-
gages require an application, albeit less exclusive. There are 15
separate documents totaling 41 pages altogether — we’re not
going to attempt to list them all here, partially because many are
self-explanatory (such as the Borrower Notification, in which you
acknowledge that you’ve seen all the necessary paperwork) but in
the following list, you can find a brief description of the more com-
plicated forms that will require you to take an active role:
 The application: You start with the Residential Loan
Application for Reverse Mortgages (form 1009). While you 
can easily provide some of the information collected here
(address, date of birth, marital status, and things of that
nature), you also need to provide your residence type (pri-
mary, secondary, or investment property), which is actually a
trick question — only primary residences, a home you live in
as your main address, are eligible for reverse mortgages. Your
originator will need documentation of your monthly income
(if any), your real estate assets (the value of your home), and
social security number, which you can provide at any time
during the application process. The application also asks for
all liens (debts) against your property, which could include
outstanding mortgages, government liens, or other financial
commitments on your home. This is not the place to list your
credit card debt; that comes later.
Your signature on this application doesn’t mean you’re
indebted to a loan . . . yet. Your signature asserts that you, the
potential borrower, certifies that the information on the appli-
cation is true and correct and that you do indeed understand
the implications of (and still want) a reverse mortgage. 
Below your signature is an optional section that describes
your ethnicity and gender, intended to educate the lender as
to who is getting reverse mortgages, and who is possibly
being discriminated against. This information is collected only
for the sake of your and future borrowers’ protection. You can
choose not to fill it out, but your originator will do it for you
after you leave, so you may as well make sure they get it right.
Chapter 9: Working on Step Two: Your Originator 141

There’s also an addendum to the application that HUD cre-
ated, which is necessary for anyone getting an HECM loan
(see Chapter 5 for more on this loan type). The supplement is
used for Mortgage Insurance Premiums and simply gets data
like your name and address (yes, again), whether or not
you’re a first-time homebuyer (obviously not) and what the
purpose of the loan is (you’ll check “refinance”). It also, oddly
enough, asks if you’ve received information about lead paint
poisoning. Can you blame them for wanting to cover their
bases?
 Tax and Insurance Disclosure: Okay, technically speaking,
anyone could figure out this form, but this disclosure requires
you to make a big decision so you should know all you can.
Essentially, it allows you to choose whether you want to pay
your property taxes and hazard insurance premiums yourself,
or let the lender withhold part of your check to do it for you. 
If you forget to pay your property taxes or insurance, your
loan may be terminated, forcing you to pay up right away. Of
course, they won’t yank your loan out from under you if
you’re late on one payment, but if you consistently miss pay-
ments, they have the right to revoke your loan. Unless your
originator advises you not to have tax and insurance paid by
the lender, it can’t hurt to take one more thing off your to-do
list. It’s vital that taxes and insurance are paid, and allowing
your lender to do it ensures that you won’t accidentally
default on them.
If you choose this route, the lenders will take out a portion of
your available loan funds either ahead of time, setting aside
the amount they estimate you’d pay if you stayed in the home
for as long as the loan was intended, or they’ll pull it out as
you go if you’ve chosen to receive a monthly payment. The
form allows you to choose to let them withhold just the
money for your taxes, just the money for your insurance,
both, or neither. 
 Reverse Mortgage Comparison (RMC): It’s the crowning
moment . . . when your originator tallies up your variables and
tells you how much they think you can borrow. The Reverse
Mortgage Comparison (RMC) is a chart that calculates how
much money you can expect to get when you sign off on your
loan. It is not (repeat, not) a guarantee. The nifty part is that it
shows you how your loan would break down if you chose an
HECM with the monthly or annual ARM (Chapter 5), or the
Home Keeper (Chapter 6). The RMC doesn’t typically include
the Jumbo Cash Account, but you can request that your origi-
nator factor it in. Although this form is based on guesses and
assumptions only, it helps your originator give you a pretty
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
142

good idea of what your money will look like when you start
your loan and helps you determine whether the expenses of a
reverse mortgage justify the loan.
 Good Faith Estimate (GFE): This is the last element of the
loan application and is the originator’s hallmark — a listing of
all your fees and seemingly random costs that you can expect
to pay either at closing or afterward, financed into your loan.
The GFE is a great planning tool and lets you see exactly how
much you’re paying to get your loan, and how it breaks down.
Once you see your GFE, you can decide whether you want to
pay your fees up-front or finance them into your loan.
Getting ready for closing
After the originator submits your file and all the forms to an under-
writing department, where everything in your file will be checked
to make sure that you received all the proper disclosures and that
the documentation about your age is included. The underwriter
reviews the appraiser’s report and checks much, much, more just
to be sure everything is as it should be. If everything is complete,
the underwriter will issue the approval for the originator to pre-
pare the loan documents for closing.
When the originator orders the loan documents to be prepared,
the final calculation on how much you will get in funds from the
reverse mortgage is determined. That calculation is based on what
the index rates are as announced by the Federal Reserve on the
Monday of the week your loan documents are prepared. 
To find the index rates, go to www.bankrate.com. You can find list-
ings of all the current index rates — just be sure you know which
one you’re looking for. Remember, the HECM is based on the one-
year U.S. Treasury securities rate, Home Keeper is based on the
one-month secondary market CD, and the Cash Account is based
on the six-month LIBOR.
When the lender approves your loan, the originator draws up all
necessary paperwork for closing. Once the loan is closed, the checks
start rolling in. This is also the time when any closing costs will be
due to the originator, unless you decide to finance them as part of
your loan. Almost everyone finances the costs into their loan, but
if you have the financial ability to pay them in cash, you may as
well (you can read more about the closing process in Chapter 11).
Most, but not all originators turn every duty after this point over
to the servicing lender. However, you should still feel free to call
your originator at any time if you have questions or problems with
Chapter 9: Working on Step Two: Your Originator 143

your loan. Even if they’re not responsible for the problem, you can
be sure they will want to help you fix it. Originators rely largely on
referrals from customers just like you — they know that if you’re
happy, you’ll tell your friends and family about it . . . and that if
you’re unhappy you’ll tell anyone who will listen. A good originator
takes your satisfaction seriously, so don’t be afraid to use them to
their full extent. That’s what they’re there for.
Going Behind the Scenes:
Processors and Underwriters
Different mortgage companies work in different ways: Some intro-
duce you to all the members of the staff, while others pretend that
all the work is done by one very talented originator. The truth is,
no one can do it on their own — even if you don’t meet these
important players, remember to thank them in your big fat check
acceptance speech. 
Giving processors credit
It’s easy to forget that someone has to actually put together your
loan documents and submit them for approval. The little elves who
manage all of this are called processors, and you may or may not
ever know they’re there. 
The processor starts by collecting all the relevant loan information
from you and verifies that all of this information is true and accu-
rate. Since they can’t chop you down and count your rings, proces-
sors need proof that you’re really the age you claim to be. In most
arenas we try to pass ourselves off as younger than we really are,
but because you get more money from a reverse mortgage as you
age, people often try to appear older than their birth date would
suggest. Don’t bother trying to pull anything over on a processor:
They know every trick in the book. Processors usually confirm
your age with a birth certificate or valid driver’s license, but they
can also use a state-issued photo I.D., a passport, a military I.D., a
permanent or temporary resident card, and a whole host of others.
Some states have rules about which cards are valid, but your
processor will let you know what they can accept.
Processors also need to establish proof of residency because reverse
mortgages are only for your primary residence. They can get proof
of residency off of that same state I.D., billing statements, govern-
ment documents, or other records, depending on how strict the
underwriter is. For more on residency rules, check out Chapter 3.
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
144

Some processors are responsible for ordering the home appraisal,
although many originators take that task upon themselves (see
Chapter 10 for more on the appraisal). They may also make sure
that you have homeowner’s insurance, are up-to-date on your
property taxes, and get any other loan requirements out of the way
before the loan leaves their desk.
Next, the processor prepares all of your loan documents and sub-
mits your whole file to the underwriter. If the underwriter comes
back with certain conditions that must be met prior to you getting
your loan, the processor will share that with you (sometimes via
the originator) and then make sure that you’ve done whatever was
necessary to satisfy the underwriter. If you’ve made arrangements
to have those conditions taken care of after the loan closes, the
processor makes a note of it and creates fresh loan documents for
you to sign.
Deciding your future: underwriters
Strangely enough, the person who approves your loan — the
underwriter — will never meet you. Although underwriters are inti-
mately involved in your loan, know everything about you, your
finances, your home, your age, and your life expectancy, they don’t
know you. Some originators have in-house underwriters (in the
same office or company) but most rely on outside help, either from
individuals or from the lender. Their main job is to make sure your
loan application and all the documents are complete and accurate.
It’s also their job to ensure that everyone receives the information
to properly structure and finalize an incomplete loan package.
Once the underwriter has approved your loan, the documents are
sent back to the processor and your loan is completed. It can take
anywhere from four to eight weeks to get an answer from the
underwriter (although in emergencies they can usually get it done
sooner) so just relax and wait. Unless you’ve lied about your age,
live in a refrigerator box under the freeway, or refuse to comply
with the appraiser’s repair requirements, you should have no prob-
lem getting approved for the loan you and your originator have
been expecting.
Finding an Originator
Finding an originator is actually the easiest part of the process. 
It’s finding a good one that can be hard. You may have already
received several mailers from reverse mortgage originators in your
area who are trying to get your business, or gotten a call from a
Chapter 9: Working on Step Two: Your Originator 145

telemarketer offering you a free assessment. How do you find a
worthy originator? There are five main sources: national associa-
tions, friends and family, community centers, the Internet, and
advertisements. Each has its pros and cons, so combining these
techniques can be the best way to ferret out the best of the best.
We describe each of these sources in the sections that follow.
Starting with national associations
When trying to find an originator check with these associations:
 National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA):
The obvious place to start is the NRMLA. A complete list 
of NRMLA members can be found at its Web site, www.
reversemortgage.org or by calling 866-264-4466.
 AARP: You can also get a list of NRMLA originators from
AARP at its Web site, www.aarp.org, or call 202-434-6042.
Although their members have signed a Code of Conduct,
NRMLA does not (and will not) endorse any particular origina-
tor (nor will AARP or HUD). They may give you a list of 20
people in your city, but they can’t tell you who has the nicest
receptionist or who gets the best reviews. Fortunately, those
originators who break the Code of Conduct and are reported
will most likely be removed from the list.
 Housing and Urban Development (HUD): Another unbiased
organization that can suggest reverse mortgage originators in
your area is your local HUD office. Its Web site (www.hud.gov)
offers information on the reverse mortgage and how to find a
HUD-approved lender.
 American Society on Aging: A local chapter of this organiza-
tion will probably have information on well-respected reverse
mortgage originators. Contact them by calling 415-974-9600.
Asking friends and family
Your originator not only depends on you for referrals, but you, too,
have a chance to be on the receiving end of that axiom of the mort-
gage business. Do you know anyone who has gotten a reverse
mortgage? Chances are good that you do, even if you weren’t aware
of it. Ask around, and we bet you’ll be surprised at who already has
one. You can also ask if your friends or family know anyone who
has one. Even if you have to talk to your sister’s neighbor’s hair-
dresser’s mother, it can be worth getting an assessment of one
originator’s work.
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
146

Once you’ve identified a few of your friends or family members
who have received reverse mortgages (and whose opinion you
trust), ask some of these important questions:
 Did you feel comfortable with her?
 Did he answer all your questions?
 Did she ever offer to come to your house instead of making
you go down to the office?
 When you call him, does he return your calls promptly?
 Was the staff friendly and helpful?
 Was the originator patient with you?
 Did she encourage your family to be a part of the transaction?
 Do you feel like he explained everything in clear, easy-to-
understand terms?
 Has she followed up with you since you got the reverse 
mortgage?
 Were you happy with the originator as a whole?
Try to get some meaty answers to these (and any other) questions:
A simple “yes” or “no” won’t do. Asking “how” or asking for exam-
ples can help get you more complete answers.
You can also ask your financial advisor or other professional to
suggest someone, but keep in mind that they may have a “you
scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours” arrangement with the origina-
tor. Often, industry professionals have a “preferred” list of people
to refer customers to, and although they want to send you to
someone who will do a great job for you, they may also be a little
biased.
Checking with community centers
If you live in an age-restricted neighborhood with a community
center, near a public library, or have a general community center in
your area, check the activity roster for presentations by reverse
mortgage originators. 
Originators often give free talks with question and answer sessions
in order to introduce themselves to prospective customers and
teach you more about their services. Ask your community center
or library if there is any such event planned, and if not, ask them to
set one up. 
Chapter 9: Working on Step Two: Your Originator 147

During the presentation, the originator will explain what a reverse
mortgage is, the basic qualifications, and how you can benefit.
Some will actively plug their own businesses, but many simply
leave business cards and pamphlets with their contact information
fanned out on a nearby table next to the complimentary punch and
cookies. If you feel a certain affinity for this person as an origina-
tor, go up and say hello afterward, or set up an appointment right
then and there. 
Community Center and library presentations are a great way to get
to know an originator and get a feel for his or her demeanor and
level of expertise. You may also feel more free to ask questions
such as “How long have you been doing reverse mortgages” if
you’re not sitting face-to-face in a private office, but rather as one
of many faces in an activity room. In the event that you don’t like
the presenter, or feel that he or she may not be the right originator
for you, at least you’ll get free punch and cookies out of it.
Surfing for originators
Not everyone is Internet savvy. Some seniors have never even sat
in front of a computer up to this point in their lives. But the Internet
is a terrific resource for finding reverse mortgage originators. If
you don’t own a computer but feel okay about operating one, you
can use those at your local library, or ask a friend; if you think a
computer mouse must be some kind of little robotic rodent, call
your grandchildren or other family computer experts and ask them
to sit down with you at their computer to get you started.
The easiest way to search for a reverse mortgage originator online
is to go to a search engine like www.google.com (a Web site that
works like a virtual Dewey decimal system of everything on the
Internet). In the box that says “Search” you’ll type in specific key
words; try “reverse mortgage” in quotes, followed by a space and
then your city. For example, if you live in Dallas, you’ll type in:
“reverse mortgage” Dallas
If that gives you too many results, try to narrow it down by 
typing in:
“reverse mortgage” originator, Dallas
You can also try:
“reverse mortgage” lender, Dallas
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
148

The search engine will bring up lists of all the Web sites out there
that have anything to do with reverse mortgages in Dallas. You
may have to wade through them to determine which ones are actu-
ally useful (this is where a friend or family member who knows
about searching online can really come in handy). 
You can also use the Internet to find out more about the origina-
tors on your list from NRMLA or AARP. If there’s a Web site listed
by their names, you can often read about the people, their busi-
nesses, and their mission statements on their sites. In cases where
a Web site isn’t listed, you can search for that person the same way
you did above. For example, if you wanted to get the scoop on
John Lucas in Van Nuys, California, you’d type in:
“John Lucas” “reverse mortgage” “Van Nuys”
Find out as much as you can about any particular originator before
going in to meet them in person — you’ll feel more comfortable
talking with someone you feel like you already know.
Paying attention to advertisements
You know all that junk mail you get every day and instantly throw
away or even shred? You know those radio commercials that you
ignore or change the station to avoid? Start paying attention. 
Originators are smart marketers. They have access to public
records that tell them the demographic information in any given
neighborhood; they know where seniors frequent; and they know
which radio stations and television shows you tune into. It can be 
a little unnerving when you think about it, but it’s just part of their
job: finding their target audience and advertising profusely.
Now that you’ve got your mind on reverse mortgages, keep your
eyes and ears out for originators advertising their services. Listen
for phrases like “retire on the house” or key words such as 
“seniors” and “home equity.” Look for ads that feature seniors
prominently. 
You can also tell a lot about the originator by the style of their
advertisement. Is it something they just threw together like a black
and white photocopy? Or a nice full-color glossy flier? Is there a
photo of the originator in the ad? Do the words they’ve used seem
overly aggressive? While you can’t always judge a book by its
cover, you can get a pretty good idea of the kind of person you’ll be
dealing with by their ad. Use clues like these to choose an origina-
tor that seems right for you.
Chapter 9: Working on Step Two: Your Originator 149

Once you’ve narrowed it down to two or three candidates, give
them each a call (don’t just drop in, since they may be busy with
other appointments). Try to get a feeling for their demeanor and
expertise. You need an originator who treats you with respect and
kindness from the very first phone call. Then, if your instincts tell
you to go ahead, make an appointment to meet and discuss your
options. 
Avoiding Predatory Lending
The reverse mortgage has been called the “antidote to predatory
lending.” Unfortunately, there are still some individuals who try to
take advantage of borrowers — especially seniors. These people
are called “predatory lenders” because they target certain groups
(most often seniors, low-income families, and minorities) and
exploit them for profit. 
Outsmarting a predatory lender
We can’t let a few bad apples spoil the whole barrel, but here are a
few key points to be aware of when shopping for a reverse mort-
gage originator:
 Don’t go through an “estate planning” service. They will
charge you fees just to find you an originator, which is some-
thing you can do for free.
 Don’t use anyone, for that matter, who offers to find you an
originator for a fee.
 Don’t pay anyone to give you information about reverse mort-
gages. Your originator and counselor will do that for free.
 Don’t sign anything that requires you to pay a fee before
you’ve closed your loan.
 Don’t sign any document that has blanks that will be filled 
in later.
 Don’t let anyone pressure you into working with them. Be
wary of people who tell you they’re your only chance at get-
ting a loan.
 Don’t get a loan without a Good Faith Estimate from your orig-
inator. This document should be a very close guess as to what
you will owe upon closing, and you don’t want any surprises.
 Don’t be afraid to ask questions if you’re suspicious of a
charge. Know what your fees should be and look carefully at
your statement.

Staying protected with RESPA
“RESPA . . .” it sounds like a fancy perfume or new kind of sports
car. Actually, RESPA stand for the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act, which is enforced by the department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD). RESPA is an enforceable law, and
violators can face warnings, fines, or even jail time for especially
heinous or repeat offences. Its main purposes are to protect home-
owners and keep everything clean and fair in the real estate world.
For the most part, RESPA has two areas that could apply to you:
 RESPA requires that originators give you estimates and disclo-
sures of all costs associated with the loan, such as their own
fees and closing costs. They also have to tell you if they are
associated in any way with anyone they have referred you to
(like a contractor).
 RESPA prohibits originators from giving you or anyone else
involved in your loan a “kickback” or other “thing of value” in
exchange for referrals.
Reverse mortgage originators are very rarely guilty of these prac-
tices, since their HUD and NRMLA approval hinges on compliance
with rules and regulations just like these. If you do come across an
originator who tries to get you to sign off on a loan without telling
you what you should expect to pay, or who offers you anything
(even something small like coffee gift cards) as a reward for telling
others about him, a red flag should go up in your mind, and you
should call NRMLA, AARP, or your counselor to find out if their
actions are legal.

Web site at www.hud.gov.
Knowing Your Role
Did you think you wouldn’t have a job, too? This is your loan and
you need to hold up your end of the proceedings as well. Don’t
worry, your part is actually quite simple.
Asking questions
From the very moment you decide on an originator, start carrying
around a little notepad and a pen. Write down every question
about reverse mortgages that pops into your head — even the tiny
ones. If you tell someone that you’re getting a reverse mortgage
Chapter 9: Working on Step Two: Your Originator 151

and they ask you a question about it that you can’t answer, write it
down. If your family has questions, have them write down their
questions, too. If you’re confused about any detail of your personal
loan at all, write it down. 
When you meet with your originator, run down the list with her. If
you still have unanswered questions, don’t be afraid to keep on
asking. Many of us will pretend to understand something even
though the concept is still just beyond our grasp because we feel
embarrassed or shy. This is one time when asking questions makes
you look smarter. Get involved in your loan and show your origina-
tor that you want to learn as much about this transaction as they
can teach you.
Following up
Here’s another place where you really get involved in the loan: If
your originator asks you to bring in some kind of documentation 
or other paperwork (like proof of residency) you need to follow 
up and do it. Your originator may make an appointment for the
appraiser who will need to come to your house for a visit before
your loan closes, and you need to remember to be home to answer
any questions they may have about your house. You also need to
take charge of your destiny and make your wants and wishes known.
Originators aren’t mind readers, so let your opinion be heard.
Getting help
If any part of the loan process starts to seem overwhelming, con-
fusing, scary, or just a little too frazzling, get help. Ask your adult
children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, friends, or professionals
(like attorneys or financial planners) for their assistance. You can
ask someone to stay with you while the appraiser is there or drive
you to the originator’s office (although your originator may be will-
ing to come to you). You can also call on your reverse mortgage
counselor to ask for additional advice. 
We all get a little frightened when faced with the idea of signing
papers with fine print, especially when it involves large sums of
money and your home. Having a support system in place helps you
get through it all with nary a hitch. Letting your friends and family
help you is also a good way to initiate them into the reverse mort-
gage process and educate them as to what their individual roles
may be later on in the loan.

Going Forward with Step
Three: Getting Appraised
In This Chapter
 Getting to know your appraiser
 Preparing for a visit from the appraiser
 Understanding how your home is appraised
You may have some idea of your home’s value . . . to yourself.
You may love your home so much that you think it must be
worth $600,000 even though other homes exactly like it are selling
for $285,000 down the street. Of course they don’t have your stun-
ning hand-painted wallpaper, which surely brings the price up a
few notches. Then there’s the tree that your kids planted when
they were small, which is worth more to you in sentimental dollars
than anyone could imagine. And your kitchen is so well cared for it
hasn’t needed to be updated since 1972; that must count for some-
thing, right?
You may or may not be surprised to find out that not everyone has
the same view of your beloved home. We’re sure it’s lovely, but it
takes a professional to determine exactly what the fair market
price would be if you were to sell it. That professional is the
appraiser, whose job is crucial to the reverse mortgage process.
One of the biggest determining factors in your reverse mortgage is
your appraisal. Although you may find it amazing that such a huge
aspect of the reverse mortgage process is based on the opinion of
a stranger, you should understand how important it is to have an
unbiased set of eyes appraising your home. In this chapter you get
to know the appraiser’s duties and see how an appraiser determines
the value of your home.

Meeting Your Appraiser
When an appraiser visits your house, the whole idea is to come up
with a market value for the home. Market value is the closest indi-
cation of what your home would sell for in a competitive market,
based on how much similar homes are selling for in your area and
what sort of condition your house is in. Essentially, if you put your
home up for sale today, the market value is an estimate of what
you could probably expect to get for it.
The role of the reverse mortgage appraisal is to help the lender,
who isn’t anywhere near your home, decide how much your home
is worth so that they can figure out how much to lend you. All of
this takes place long before you actually sign off on the loan. All
you’ll have done so far is visited the counselor and filled out the
application with your originator — you’re not locked in, and you
can still change your mind about getting the loan. 
Securing an appraiser
In Chapter 9 we show you how important it is to choose the right
originator — it takes time, effort, asking lots of questions, and find-
ing someone you really trust. But finding an appraiser is nothing
like that — it’s just the opposite. In fact, you won’t need to find an
appraiser at all. When you decide to start the application process
for a reverse mortgage, your originator contacts the appraiser for
you. The appraiser or originator then contacts you to set up the
appointment based on both of your schedules. 
Appraisers are busy folks and often only have specific windows of
time available. They need to get a feeling for your schedule, but
flexibility is important. Try to be as accommodating with your time
as possible when you make the appointment, and be sure to sched-
ule it with enough time before you plan to close your loan. You
can’t expect them to arrive the next day — appointments are usu-
ally made for three to seven days in advance. Once the appoint-
ment is set, all you have to do is be sure that you’re home. 
Technically, you aren’t required to be at the appraisal, but we highly
recommend it. You need to be around to produce permits and
repair or construction records, answer questions about the home,
and explain any oddities. This is not, however, your chance to
follow the appraiser around showing off every little detail about
your home. If the appraiser needs you, the appraiser will come 
get you.
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
154

Of course, the appraiser isn’t just some schlub off the street. Every
state requires that appraisers be licensed or certified by the Office
of Real Estate Appraisers in order to appraise homes for federally
regulated loans. Licensing and certification boards hold their mem-
bers to a code of ethics, and they are required to meet very strict
standards. Since the vast majority of reverse mortgages are regu-
lated through the Federal Housing Administration (it has the word
“federal” right in its name), you can rest assured that you’ll have a
competent evaluator. 
Most originators have a trusted collection of appraisers that they
use on a regular basis. These originators know that these profes-
sionals will give an honest and fair assessment of your home and
will be pleasant to work with. If the originators get complaints
about appraisers, the appraisers are usually off the list — after all,
originators stake their reputations on the associates they pair with
you. To be fair, however, appraisers don’t have to be your friend.
They are simply there to do an evaluation of your property. Still,
it’s better to have a nice stranger traipsing through your home and
peeking behind your oven than a grumpy one. If the appraiser has
your originator’s seal of approval, you can bet you’re in good hands.
Understanding your role
It’s the appraiser’s job to be completely impartial and objective
when he or she goes through your home. And because most
appraisers realize they’re an intrusion in your home, they make an
effort to be affable, wipe their feet on the way in, and show patience
if you want to ask questions (just don’t go overboard). Appraisers
only ask two things of you:
 Leave them alone. It’s very distracting to have someone, even
a nice and helpful someone like you, talking to them about
your new tile flooring and offering to hold one end of the
measuring tape. Let the appraiser do his or her job, and he or
she will be less inclined to rush the evaluation and can spend
more time taking note of your beautiful home.
 Be available if they need you. Appraisers will always have
questions for you: when was this kitchen redone? Have you
ever noticed this leak? When was your last exterior paint job?
Who built this patio cover? Get ready for questions like these,
but let your appraiser ask before you give him or her extra
information.
Chapter 10: Going Forward with Step Three: Getting Appraised 155

Preparing for the Visit
You know how your friends claim that they don’t mind if you clean
up before they come over? Well the appraiser does mind. You don’t
need to hire professional cleaners, but if you’ve been letting a few
chores go unattended for a while, you’ll want to take care of them.
The pride of ownership that is apparent by the tidiness of your
home will probably translate to how well your property has been
maintained. The nicer your home looks, the more impressed the
appraiser will be. Before your appraiser comes, run down this easy
spruce-up checklist to make a good impression:
 Tidy up around the house. Take a weekend to get organized.
Put away your seasonal items that aren’t in use, make some
sense of your junk room, and try to keep things neat. It’s a lot
easier for the appraiser to get a good idea of your home’s value
if they don’t have to wade through 13 years of old newspapers.
 Clean the exterior. Hire a neighbor kid to come clean your
rain gutters for a few bucks, trim up the hedges, and clear out
anything that makes your yard look like a garage sale. This is
what they call “curb appeal,” and it can make a big difference
in market price.
 Replace the broken stuff . . . but only if you can afford it.
Some people aren’t in a position to start fixing things (that’s
why they need a reverse mortgage), but if you can, it may
increase your lending limit. Think of it as an investment.
 Give your home the once-over. Try to go around your house
with the eye of an appraiser. If you can attend to a problem
right now then by all means, do it. Get your plumber nephew
to fix your running toilet, ask your daughter-in-law to help you
clear a path to the attic — you want your home to be just a
few degrees shy of the way you’d want it to look if you were
going to try to sell it.
At the same time, there are definitely things that you don’t need to
worry about. Major renovations that are for aesthetic purposes
will never reap the full value of your investment. If you spend
$50,000 to upgrade your bathroom, there’s no guarantee that your
home will be worth $50,000 more when the appraiser comes 
a-knockin’. Unless you plan to install $100 bills as your wallpaper,
an appraiser can only judge the improvements subjectively —
despite your receipts, what a brand new bathroom is really worth
is all up to perception. Since your appraisal value is based on recent
market values in your area and the safe-and-soundness of your
home, a big upgrade is quite a gamble if housing prices in your
neighborhood won’t support it. Three major renovations that they
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
156

suggest you only do if it’s for your own pleasure (and not to
increase your home value) are:
 Tear out your kitchen or bathroom just to increase your
home’s value. If you want to do it for your own enjoyment,
that’s great, but it won’t return an equal dollar amount on
your investment.
 Put in a pool or spa, unless you think you’ll get your
money’s worth strictly from your own use. Pools are nice,
but the cost and hassle aren’t worth it if your only goal is to
amp up your value.
 Build a new patio or deck, unless you love to sit outside,
since you’ll only get a fraction back of what you spend to
erect it. Anyone can build an outdoor area, and it won’t add
enough to your home value to make it worth your while.
There are some areas where, if you can afford to do it, investing in
your home now can help increase the appraised value of your
home. For instance, a house can be lovely and charming on the
outside, but inside it can be wall-to-wall avocado-colored shag car-
peting (you know who you are). If the appliances in the kitchen are
30 years old, that brings your value down, too. In the 1960s, match-
ing upholstery and wallpaper were the height of home décor; now
it just makes a house look dated. Remember, there’s a difference
between outdated and vintage.
Chapter 10: Going Forward with Step Three: Getting Appraised 157
Retro style
How do you know if the features that you’ve loved since your home was built 50
years ago are fashionable and desirable or just plain old? One easy way to see how
hip your house rates is to check out the home décor and antique magazines on your
newsstand. No one’s home really looks like those glossy pages, but you can get a
good idea of the style that’s popular today. Home decorating shows on television
can also help you assess what’s “hot” and what’s not. If you haven’t redecorated in
over 10 years, there’s a good chance your décor could use some freshening up. The
biggest point to remember is: You only need to worry about things that won’t leave
the house if you moved out. Will you be taking your furniture? Of course. Your
carpet? No way. 
At the same time, there are certain elements that are definitely desirable, and con-
sidered “vintage.” That translates roughly into “something old that we’ll pay a lot
for.” Some good things to keep as long as they are in excellent condition may be:
* An oven from the 1940s
* Original ceramic or porcelain tiles in your kitchen or bath
(continued)

Getting Your Home Evaluated
The appraiser projects the value of your home in three main ways:
 Is your property safe?
 Is your property in good condition?
 How does it compare to others in your neighborhood?
The appraiser attempts to answer those questions by investigating
the visible components of your home and property, by taking photos,
and by reviewing the home’s records. Try not to take any of the
appraisal personally; it’s not a judgment of you, just the home.
The appraiser takes note of things that the lender needs to know 
to make sure it’s not investing its money in a dud of a house. First
the appraiser measures all around the home and creates a pretty
accurate floor plan. Square footage is noted, as well as what type 
of garage, windows, foundation, flooring, appliances, and air condi-
tioning you have. The appraiser also jots down what condition
each of these elements is in and whether or not they will need to
be repaired or replaced. If your water supply comes from a well 
or other private source, the appraiser will put in an order to test
the water, and trust us, he or she will let you know if that needs
fixing, too.
The appraiser also checks your site and property condition. The
appraiser typically considers whether you get a lot of noise from
the street or live near a highway; whether there any sink holes on
your property; whether you’re near anything that may suddenly
explode, like a gas tank; and whether your home is located close

* Hardwood floors
* A unique fireplace mantel
* Elegant lighting fixtures
(continued)

enough to a high-voltage tower that if it fell over it would squish
your house.
Of course, the appraiser checks for things such as termite damage,
inaccessible roads, cracked floor supports, unventilated attics,
leaking roofs, poor plumbing and several other considerations,
none of which will automatically disqualify you from getting a
reverse mortgage — but they may lower your property value. 
Taking snapshots
One of the most effective ways for the appraiser to evaluate your
home is by taking pictures all over the place. This serves three
main purposes:
 It jogs the memory. Your appraiser may hit four or more
houses every day. That’s a lot of properties to keep straight.
Photos help the appraiser keep track of what was seen and
also helps the appraiser look in greater detail and take more
time examining a photo than he or she may have at your
home.
 It protects the appraiser, and it protects you. Call it evidence,
call it good measure — the point is, photos offer proof of the
condition of your home. If the appraiser comes back with an
estimated value for your home that you feel is incredibly low,
they can whip out their photos and show you exactly why
they made the assessment that they did. This can also work
to your advantage if they cite “severe foundation damage” but
the photos reveal only a tiny sliver of a crack. In that case,
you may be able to get a new appraisal.
 It helps the lender understand the valuation. When your
lender (the organization lending you money) sees your
appraiser’s report, it has to take the appraiser’s word that
your home is worth what the appraiser has established. The
photos of comparable properties will also show you and the
lender that the appraiser was indeed comparing your home to
homes similar to yours.
All appraisers take photos of the front and back of the home, the
sides, the view from the street, and the “street scene,” or what you
may see if you were to stand in the driveway and look around. But
here’s the weird part: They also take pictures of similar homes in
your area. This is for comparison’s sake. You may hear them refer
to this other house as a comp or comparable. Getting photos of
your neighbors’ homes helps the appraiser get a better idea of
what a house in your area should look like. Appraisal isn’t an exact
science, so it helps to have as many variables as possible.
Chapter 10: Going Forward with Step Three: Getting Appraised 159

Checking safety
One of the most important aspects of the appraisal — if not the
most important — is whether your home is safe for you to live in.
The appraiser can see what condition your home is in, and deter-
mine whether it’s livable, fixable, sellable, or just plain demolish-
able. Of course, the appraiser’s first concern is your safety. If there
are too many necessary repairs that must be completed in order to
meet FHA standards, you may not be able to get a loan.
Nearly every “yes” or “no” box that they check off on the appraisal
forms dictates how safe your house is. This is partly for resale pur-
poses (let’s be real here) but it’s mostly to ensure that the home
you’re staying in is fit for living. If your toilet doesn’t work, that’s a
problem. If your heater doesn’t work and you live in Maine, that’s 
a problem. If a broken window is letting birds into your attic, 
that’s a problem. Luckily, problems like these all have simple 
solutions. Just fix them. Not so simple problems may be more in
the sinking foundation range, where the cost to repair the issue
isn’t worth the value of the home. If the costs to make your home
safe are more than 15 percent of your home’s estimated value,
you’re probably better off moving. In fact, Fannie Mae rules (see
Chapter 6 for more on Fannie Mae loans) state that any home with
more than 15 percent repairs is ineligible for a reverse mortgage.
On a $300,000 home, that’s $45,000 worth of restoration — unless
you need a whole new roof or would have to gut your kitchen and
start over, you probably won’t need such extensive repairs.
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
160
Checking out the safety controversy
We recently read an article written by a professor of geology that stated that reverse
mortgages are dangerous to seniors because they force our nation’s “most vulner-
able residents” to live in unsafe housing. The author’s reasoning is that seniors often
live in older houses, ergo their homes are unfit for human habitation. It follows log-
ically, argues this professor, people who get reverse mortgages stay in their treas-
ured, yet dilapidated homes because they are too weak and afraid to have
necessary repairs made. 
Now, if that doesn’t offend you maybe this will: He also argues that the best thing is
for these frail seniors to move to assisted living or other senior developments and
sell their homes to younger people so that they can make the necessary improve-
ments, thereby revitalizing the community. You didn’t know you were such a hazard
to the neighborhood, did you?
This is actually a very common misconception, but a misconception nonetheless.
Not only do all reverse mortgages require a detailed and accurate appraisal, but

Keeping up with the Joneses
Your home is compared to others in your neighborhood to see how
your house stacks up. This neighbor’s house is, for obvious rea-
sons, called a comparable. Comparables are used in real estate all
the time, both for loan appraisals and purchase appraisals. The
appraiser looks at about three additional properties and does a
sales comparison analysis for each. If your property has an anomaly
on it, like a barn or a pool in a neighborhood without many pools,
they have to make sure to get a comp house with similar features.
You’ve heard the phrase “there goes the neighborhood.” You may
have even said it yourself once. The kind of house and property
your neighbors have reflects directly on the value of your home.
Whether it’s upgrades or noisy teenagers, living conditions of
those around you will impact your home’s ability to be appraised
at a fair market value. 
You probably already have a good idea of how your home com-
pares to others on your street. Is yours the only one with two sto-
ries? Does everyone have a two-car garage but you? Is your yard
particularly well landscaped? These things make a difference.
Unfortunately, they’re largely out of your control. It’s hard to keep
up with the Joneses, especially if you get caught peeking through
their windows to see how many fireplaces they have as compared
to you. Don’t stress over your appraisal — just do your best to make
the property represent your love of your home and you’ll be fine.
Chapter 10: Going Forward with Step Three: Getting Appraised 161
anything that comes back questionable must be repaired or tested and reexamined.
No ifs, ands, or buts about it. In fact, if the lender asks you to make the repairs and
you can’t afford it at the time, they’ll set aside some money from your reverse mort-
gage to make darn sure you have the funds you’ll need to make your home safe. If
that’s the case, you’ll be required to sign a repair addendum, in which you solemnly
swear to make the repairs within a certain timeframe. 
Our aim is not to sell you on reverse mortgages, but rather to give you all the facts
you need to make an informed decision for your own future. If someone tries to con-
vince you that you should move over and let the younger people take over for the
sake of your own safety, we want you to be able to educate them, too.

Sealing the Deal with 
Step Four: Closing
In This Chapter

 Following up
W
hew! It may take a lot of time, meetings, and decision-
making to get to this point, but you can get here — closing
your loan. This is a big process from the originator and other
staff’s standpoint, but for you it’s a piece of cake. Just like your last
forward mortgage, a reverse mortgage wraps up, signaling the
beginning of payments . . . except this time you’re the one getting
the checks. Unlike your last mortgage, you don’t need to dread
going to the mailbox to find your mortgage bill. Now you can run
down to meet the mail carrier at the curb — arms outstretched —
to get your money, or delight in the magic of direct deposits. But
before any of that can happen, use this chapter to check out the
things you and your originator need to finalize first.
Making Your Loan Final
Your loan process, from meeting your counselor (see Chapter 8) to
closing the deal, can take anywhere from two weeks to several
months, depending on how determined you are to get a reverse
mortgage. By the time you’re ready to talk about closing, you may
be anxious to get this whole ordeal over with — even if everything
has gone smoothly, it’s nice to have mortgages off your mind. The
loan closing will definitely be an exciting day for you, just as it was
when you bought your home. After all, this will be the day you get
yourself one step closer to financial security.

Getting an overview of closing
At closing, your originator meets with you for one last meeting to
go over your closing costs, Total Annual Loan Cost (TALC), and
any last-minute details. This is also your originator’s last chance to
impress you enough to make you refer a friend, so get the most out
of your time together. Make your originator earn the referrals —
here are some ideas how:
 Find out about other senior resources.
 Ask for the name of a good contractor for your remodel.
 See if your originator knows of any deals you can get for
future financial services.
 Use this opportunity to ask questions and settle every little
lingering concern. 
In addition to you and the originator, there will also be a few extra
people present at your closing: there will most likely be additional
staff from the originator’s office (an assistant or junior originator,
for instance), and the escrow or title company’s agent. 
Don’t be alarmed by the words “title” or “escrow.” The title com-
pany simply handles the recording of your mortgage in the county
records, and the escrow agent covers any legal documentation.
You should know by now that when you get a reverse mortgage
you keep the title on your home. Even so, like any mortgage, the
reverse mortgage is recorded as a lien against your property. This
exact same thing occurred when you took out a mortgage on your
home last time.
Your appointment may take at least an hour, but most of that time
is spent going over things you already know: which loan you chose,
how you’ll receive your payments, and what your responsibilities
are as a homeowner.
After the initial pleasantries and congratulations, you and your
originator can get down to business, which includes determining
your actual loan cost, getting your signature on lots of documents,
and (the best part) getting your payments ready. You can happily
sit back and start dreaming of all the wonderful things you can do
with your new-found money.
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
164

Finding out more about 
repair addendums
During closing, the originator wants to ensure that anything that
could hamper your loan process has been taken care of. Were you
supposed to get your plumbing fixed or other repairs completed?
Was there an unsafe tree in your yard that needed to be felled?
Make sure you’ve settled all of this before the closing. 
If you’ve made arrangements to make repairs or other changes
after your loan has been signed and sealed, one of the documents
you have to sign at closing is the repair addendum. Review this
carefully to make sure you understand the details of the agreement.
If the lender requires you to make a repair by a certain date and
you choose not to do it, your lender has the right to terminate
your loan. Don’t ignore these conditions.
Of course, anyone who owns a home knows that there are thou-
sands of little things that can go wrong. So repair addendums are
common, especially in older homes that may not have had any
improvements or updates in the past few years. Your appraiser will
note anything that needs to be repaired on the appraisal forms and
hands these recommendations over to the originator. He or she
includes all this with your application for a reverse mortgage, and
the lender reviews it to see if there are repairs that must be com-
pleted in order for the loan to be processed, or if your home
simply needs too many repairs and is ineligible for the loan.
The repair addendum simply forces you to stop putting off those
home improvements and to make your house a safer place to live.
If any of the required repairs are considered to be either “health
and safety” items or structural in nature, they may be required to
be completed prior to closing. Your originator can advise you
whether it’s likely you’ll have immediate repairs, or whether you
can expect to receive a repair addendum from the lender after you
get your appraiser’s report. 
Examples of some frequent causes for repair addendums include: 
 A leaky roof
 Termite infestation
 Poor plumbing or roots growing into your pipes
 A damaged foundation
 Unsafe structures (maybe a staircase that’s on its last breath,
or a homemade gazebo)
Chapter 11: Sealing the Deal with Step Four: Closing 165

 Mold problems (not just the stuff in your bathroom grout)
 Hazardous appliances
 Bad wiring
 Excessive brush (in wildfire areas)
Finalizing calculations
The originator can’t make the final calculations until two things
happen:
 The lender formally approves the loan.
 The originator orders the closing documents to be prepared.
Unfortunately, you don’t have any control over either of these
things. On the upside, these events usually happen fairly quickly
once the loan starts rolling along — your originator wants you to
get your money almost as much as you want to see it sitting safely
in your bank. 
The interest rate is set based on the week that your closing docu-
ments are prepared. Then the originator plugs all your information
(age, home value, and interest rate) into a program and presto —
your loan amount is finally totaled!
At closing you get your Total Annual Loan Cost (TALC), or the true
cost of the loan over time. Note that the cost of the loan is different
than the value of the loan. Cost refers to what you will pay to take
out the loan (the principal loan amount, plus interest, fees, and
other costs) while value refers only to the principal amount. The
TALC’s aim is to give you an idea of what this loan will cost you.
(See Chapter 4 for more on this topic.)
The TALC isn’t always as straightforward as it seems. No one
knows how long you’ll really stay in your house, or what will
happen to your home’s value, so even this “true” TALC is another
guess by your originator. For more information about the TALC,
see Chapter 4. You can also find out more on TALC by visiting
www.aarp.org/revmort.
Up until closing, the total amount you can expect to borrow is
really only an estimate, based on your age, home value, and inter-
est rates. Which of these factors do you think could affect your
loan amount by fluctuating in the span of a few weeks? Not your
age, because everyone knows how old you’ll be, and not your
home value, because an appraiser has already signed off on exactly
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
166

how much your home is worth. Your interest rate, however,
changes every week.
Unlike a forward mortgage, you can’t lock in a rate when you start
talking about your loan. Many forward mortgage originators use
rate locks as marketing tactics, and incentives for people to hurry,
locking their rates in right that second. Then all the borrowers have
to do is sign off on the loan within a certain timeframe. Reverse
mortgage originators don’t have that luxury. Instead, the lender and
originator use the current rate in effect at the time you make your
initial loan application to give you an estimate of the amount of funds
you may receive at closing. That rate is called the expected rate.
To get the expected rate, your originator simply takes the latest
index for your loan product and adds a margin to it (see Chapters
5, 6, and 7 for more specifics on how your reverse mortgage’s inter-
est rate specifically calculated). We give you some examples for
each loan product here: 
 If this week’s index for an HECM is 4.04, the originator would
add a margin of 1.5 to that index for a monthly adjusted loan,
for a total expected rate of 5.54 percent. 
 If this week’s index for the Home Keeper is 2.20, the origina-
tor would add a margin of 3.40 for a total of 5.60 percent.
 If this week’s index for the Jumbo Cash Account is 2.60 and
the originator adds a margin of 5.00, your total expected rate
would be 7.60 percent.
Interest rates and loan amounts are inverse proportions: the higher
the expected rate, the lower your estimated amount borrowed and
vice versa. You may have your loan amount estimated at $75,000
with a 6.72 percent expected rate, but by the time your loan is actu-
ally ready to close, rates are down to 5.03 percent, which may bring
your available loan amount up to $80,000. It can also work in the
opposite direction, which can be more than a little disappointing.
Chapter 11: Sealing the Deal with Step Four: Closing 167
Gambling on your rate
Expected rates are pretty close to the actual rate that will determine your loan
amount, but only if you act in a timely manner. Let’s say you go talk to your counselor,
get all fired up about your prospective mortgage, and see your originator the next
week. After talking about your options and figuring out an estimated loan amount,
based on the three magic factors (age, home value, and expected rate), your

Executing the loan: Your signature
Painful as the loan process can sometimes be, executing a loan
does not involve a firing squad. Execution simply refers to your sig-
nature. Warm up your wrist and bring your lucky pen, because you
have to sign and initial pages and pages of documents. Even so, the
execution process is actually very straightforward.
By the time you’re ready to close, your originator has already gone
over all of the documents with you, explaining the fine print, help-
ing you wade through all the technical jargon, and giving you
ample time to have a family member or professional look them
over, if you wish. You should find no surprises when you signing
your closing documents. 
If something looks foreign or you’ve forgotten what something
means, just ask. You need to fully understand what you’re 
autographing.
Some documents must be signed in the presence of a notary
public. Your originator should provide a notary public for you
(often it will be the escrow or title agent) to make this as hassle-
free as possible. If a document needs a notary verification, don’t
sign it by yourself — notaries are there to verify that your signa-
ture came from your hand. If the document is executed without a
notary present, your originator has to throw out that form and
start all over. This is solely for your protection: If a fraudulent
person (or even a well-meaning family member) has gotten away
with posing as you up to now, this is where that person is stopped. 
After your originator sets up a particular time and day for your
loan closing, make sure you show up on time. Besides having gath-
ered all the necessary people to close your loan at precise moment,
it causes problems for the originator if you skip your own closing
because closing documents are prepared and dated for a certain
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
168
originator gives you that total to build your dreams on. If you decide to move for-
ward with the loan within in next few weeks, there’s a good chance that the actual
amount you can borrow will be similar to the estimated total, because rates will
probably not have shifted too much in that timeframe. However, if you aren’t quite
sure about the loan, or you’ve started to feel scared that the loan is too big of a step,
every week that you put it off is another week that the rates can change. Never rush
into a loan, but try to stay realistic about your concerns as well. Your concerns that
make you wait a few months before going forward with your loan could mean you
get a lot less (or maybe a lot more) money than you had hoped.
(continued)

day. You must sign the documents on that day, or they need to be
redrawn (prepared again).
Changing Your Mind: Your 
Right of Rescission
You’ve signed the documents. You get home. You feel like you’ve
just made a terrible mistake. Now what? All reverse mortgage prod-
ucts have a three-day right of rescission, which means that within
the first three days after signing your loan, you’re allowed to
change your mind and cancel the whole thing.
The right of rescission is designed to protect you in case some-
thing changes in your household, you feel you’ve been bamboo-
zled, or you just plain aren’t comfortable with the mortgage. It
shouldn’t be taken lightly, however. You, your counselor, and your
originator put in a lot of hours choosing just the right loan for you:
This isn’t the sort of thing to throw away willy-nilly.
Knowing when to rescind
Life can change in a heartbeat — there are over 300,000 heartbeats
in three days, which leaves a lot of room for change. Unfortunately
(or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), the chances that
things will change drastically in the three days after you sign your
documents are slim — rescissions are pretty rare. But life happens,
and that’s why you get this time to call a “do over.” 
If you must rescind due to leaving your home, you may be able to
start the loan process over with a Home Keeper for Purchase (see
Chapter 7), which would enable you to move out and buy a new
home. Remember, don’t take the three-day rescission lightly. Some
situations that constitute a good reason to rescind your loan
include the following:
 Your home is damaged or altered making it in some way
unsuitable for you to live in.
 You suddenly become seriously ill and may not realistically
live long enough to make your loan worthwhile.
 Your children or grandchildren need to come live with you,
forcing you to move into a larger home.
 You unexpectedly inherit a large sum of money and choose to
hold off on the loan until you’re a bit older.
Chapter 11: Sealing the Deal with Step Four: Closing 169

 You or your spouse needs immediate care that cannot be
tended to in your home (in other words, you need to move
into assisted living).
 Your home inexplicably shoots up in value and you want to
switch to a jumbo loan (see Chapter 7).
 Your home inexplicably declines in value and you want to
switch to a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM; see
Chapter 5).
 Your family invites you to move in with them (which you’ve
secretly been hoping for all along).
 You decide you’d rather sell the house and relocate.
Essentially, you should only cancel your loan if, for whatever
reason, you could no longer live in your home, or project that you
need to leave it very soon. Again, the chances of this information
coming to you in the three days following your closing are very
slight, but the right is there, just in case.
Understanding when not to rescind
You’ve embarked on a significant financial responsibility, just when
you thought you were free and clear. Now you’re having second
thoughts. Don’t call up your originator and rescind your loan. Who
hasn’t had buyer’s remorse? It feels great to get a new outfit or fish-
ing lure or furniture, but when the euphoria of the purchase wears
off you start to wonder whether you can afford it. If nothing has
changed and you’ve been working with a competent originator and
counselor who have assessed your financial situation, then the
answer is yes, you can afford it.
Some people are chronic “returners,” taking back half of what they
buy. But this is a serious endeavor, and “taking it back” isn’t just a
matter of bringing in your receipt. Don’t exercise your three-day
right of rescission if:
 You’re just nervous. Don’t worry, this loan was tailored to you.
 Your family is uneducated about reverse mortgages and wants
you to cancel the loan.
 You giggle every time you say “Fannie.”
 You or another borrower becomes moderately ill — remember,
reverse mortgages can help pay for medical expenses.
 You find that you need day-to-day help — instead of rescinding
the loan to go into assisted living, consider hiring in-home care. 
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
170

 Someone offers you the same loan at a lower interest rate
(even if they could, who knows what the rates would be by
the time your loan closed?).
 You think you will get another reverse mortgage within the
next year.
If you start to have doubts, talk to your family, call your originator,
and contact your counselor. These individuals can help you deter-
mine whether or not your situation warrants a rescission. The
decision is ultimately up to you — no one can force you to keep
the loan within that three days — but weigh your options carefully.
And remember, you don’t get paid until the three days are up, so
you can’t buy a golf cart the same day your loan closes and then
change your mind about the loan.
Starting Off Your New Loan
The three days are over (see the section earlier in this chapter
“Changing Your Mind: Your Right of Recession,”), you’ve signed a
pile of documents — now’s your chance to sit back and enjoy your
new cash flow . . . almost. We let you know, in this section, about
some things that need to be taken care of before you officially
begin taking full advantage of your loan.
Paying off debts
When your loan was created, you probably “financed” a lot of
items with it: your closing costs, origination fees, servicing fees,
mortgage insurance premium (if you chose a HECM; see Chap-
ter 5), future repairs, your current mortgage balance (if your home
wasn’t paid off), and other outstanding debts. Some of these are
spread out throughout your loan, but others, like compensating
contractors who are working on your house and paying off your
previous mortgage balance, need to be paid right away. 
We list some items below that need to be paid before you can
begin enjoying your loan:
 The appraisal fee: The appraiser is one piece of the puzzle
that can’t wait to be paid. Although some allow the fee to be
incorporated in the closing cost financing, most want their
money, and they want it now. Although that payment (usually
about $350) is collected at the time of your loan application, it
can be returned to you at closing by having it financed with
the other closing costs.
Chapter 11: Sealing the Deal with Step Four: Closing 171

 Home repair costs: For home repairs (especially those
required by an appraiser/inspector), a lump sum from your
total loan amount is set aside to pay for these services. You’d
think they could trust you to pay for your own repairs, but too
many lenders have seen borrowers promise to have work
done and then spend all their money and claim they can’t
afford to hire workers. Other times, people just put it off until
the last possible second. By withholding a portion of your
loan, the lenders ensure that you have the funds available to
get the work done — and you also have an incentive to get the
work done because you can’t touch that earmarked money.
 Mortgage debt: Any outstanding mortgage incurred before
you ever heard of reverse mortgages will also need to be
repaid before you can start receiving your checks. All of this
will have been figured into your total available funds, so it
shouldn’t come as a surprise to you. For example, if your
available loan totals $140,000 and you still owe $20,000 on
your home, your total available funds reduce to $120,000.
Getting your first check
If you’ve given up your right of rescission (see the section
“Changing Your Mind: Your Right of Rescission,” earlier in this
chapter) and paid off any outstanding debts (see the previous sec-
tion, “Paying off your debts”.), you’re ready for your first check.
How you get it depends on how you chose to receive your pay-
ments (see Chapters 5, 6, and 7 for more on payment options for
each specific loan type). You should have already discussed the
payment method prior to the loan closing, both with your coun-
selor and your originator. Now is not the time to start changing
your mind, unless there has been a change in your financial situa-
tion since you last talked about it. If you do need to change your
payouts, just call your servicer (the phone number will be on your
monthly statements) and tell them what your needs are, or give
your originator a call. There is usually a nominal fee (around $50),
but it’s well worth it if a change will make a difference to your
financial comfort. For a refresher on payout types, see Chapters 5,
6, and 7. Some examples of changes that might require you to
change your payout options may be:
 You are receiving monthly tenured payments and suddenly
have a large unexpected expense, such as a medical proce-
dure, or car repairs. 
 You have a line of credit and find yourself spending the money
too quickly. In this case, a monthly payment (either tenured
or term) can help control your urge to splurge. 
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
172

 You chose term distributions and realize you’ll need to
receive money longer than your term allows. Switching to a
tenure payment will prolong your payouts.
Check out the following sections to see how getting your money
works with each payment option.
Requesting a line of credit
Probably the most popular choice in payments is the line of credit,
because you usually have more flexibility and can choose to take
out as much as you need when you need it. Your money can earn
interest depending on which loan you choose (the HECM earns a
certain percentage based on your mortgage’s interest rate — see
Chapter 5), making this a very cool option.
The Financial Freedom Cash Account loans require you to take out
at least $500 each time you withdraw from your line of credit (see
Chapter 7). If you have concerns about staying within certain
public assistance income levels, the Financial Freedom line of
credit may not be your best choice. An alternative would be either
the HECM or Home Keeper lines of credit (see Chapters 5 and 6,
respectively), which allow for more autonomy in withdrawals.
Getting your payments from a line of credit isn’t always as simple
as it is with a monthly payment. In fact, you don’t even have to
think about monthly payments: They just appear as if by magic 
in your checking account once a month (unless, of course, you
decide to have them mailed to you). You may have seen people
with home equity “credit cards” that automatically allow instant
access to their money — the reverse mortgage line of credit does-
n’t make it nearly that simple, and instead requires you to request
your money in writing. The silver lining is, it’s not all that difficult
to get your money out. It’s just one more thing to add to your “to
do” list.
To get your first payment (and any subsequent withdrawals), you
fill out a request form and either mail or fax it to the lender, letting
it know how much you want to withdraw (your originator then pro-
vides you with all the contact information you need). You then
have the option of getting a live check or authorizing the lender to
deposit the money in your bank account. You can also choose to
get a chunk of your money right away (after the three-day rescis-
sion period) and save the rest for future withdrawals. After that,
it’s up to you when you get another payment. You will be provided
with more request forms that you can use at any time (if you need
more, just ask) and you control the cash flow.
Chapter 11: Sealing the Deal with Step Four: Closing 173

Keep the request forms and contact information in a convenient
place so you don’t have to hunt for them every time you need
more money. One easy solution is to put up a corkboard or other
message center by your phone or in your kitchen — someplace
you’re sure to see it easily. Then tack up your lender’s phone
number, mailing address, and fax number, along with several
request forms. You can even fill out the forms in advance (just
leave the amount and date until the last minute). Then when you
need to send one out, you’re ready to go.
Depositing monthly checks
When you choose a monthly payment, your funds can be automati-
cally deposited into your bank account. If you receive social secu-
rity payments, they probably arrive in the same way: Your bank’s
routing number tells the organization (social security, lender, or
otherwise) where to send your money, which effortlessly material-
izes in your account. We all get distracted in our day-to-day life,
and getting your payments this way means going to the bank is just
one less thing to have on your mind. Electronic direct deposits are
safe, easy, and ensure that your money makes it into the bank, no
matter how busy you are. It’s also a great tool for people who are
sometimes forgetful (there’s a reason momentary memory lapses
are called “senior moments”) because all you have to remember to
do is spend your money.
Some people are still uncomfortable with the idea of electronic
direct deposits because they like to feel the crisp reality of a check
in their hands. That’s why you also have the option to have the
checks mailed to you (a “live” check), but unless you plan to stuff
them under your mattress, there’s no reason not to have them
electronically deposited. It’s safer and easier than getting live
checks, and they end up in the same place. 
The first check will come to you in the mail because it takes some
time to set up the electronic transfer. You’d think the lenders and
banks would have it all figured out in this technological age, but
some things still get tangled in red tape. From then on, your
monthly payments will continue to magically appear in your bank
account for as long as you keep the loan (or as long as the term
you selected). Check your balance each month to be sure your
payment made it on time. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate
to call the lender.
Pocketing a lump sum
Getting a lump sum, although not always the best payment option,
definitely gives you the biggest feeling of satisfaction when you
leave the closing. When’s the last time you had tens of thousands
Part III: Taking the Plunge 
174

of dollars sitting in your bank account? The lump sum is given to
you after all the forms are signed and everyone is happy with the
transaction (it has closed and been recorded in the county records).
The escrow company or title company will prepare a check for the
full amount of your loan, and you can either have your check mailed
to you (convenient and simple) or arrange to pick it up (but why
bother?).
Once you’ve received the check, it’s your responsibility to deposit
it. Take it straight to the bank and put it in whatever variety of
accounts you’ve decided on. If you don’t know what to do with that
money, and you don’t trust yourself to ration it, talk to a bank
member or financial advisor about setting up different bank
accounts to organize your funds. Your first check is your last, and
it really has to stretch.
You may also wish to have a family member you trust uncon-
ditionally dole the money out to you. This can get tricky if your
beloved nephew starts using your money to gamble or buy his
friends new clothes without your knowledge. If someone already
has durable power of attorney over your finances, this is a much
easier transaction.
Staying in Contact with 
Your Originator
Your originator is your last point of contact, but that doesn’t mean
the closing is the last time you’ll see her. Find out what other serv-
ices your originator offers now if you haven’t already. Many can
become allies in financial planning well after your closing, and
some are deeply involved in the senior community. They know of
special senior benefits and senior organizations you can take
advantage of, so don’t leave your closing without finding out all
you can about additional services your originator provides. 
If your originator holds events for past clients or knows of events
or classes for seniors in your area, be sure to sign up for your origi-
nator’s mailing list. We all despise junk mail, but the originator can
be a key source of community information. You may even ask him
to keep you abreast of any senior happenings in town. Staying in
contact with your originator after the closing can also be a benefit
when you have questions about your loan in process. You should
be on familiar terms with your originator by the time the loan is
complete, making it easier to come back with questions later. 
Chapter 11: Sealing the Deal with Step Four: Closing 175

Now that your money is flowing, take a moment and assess your
finances again (you should have created a detailed budget before
even speaking with your counselor). Look at how much money is
coming in, and how much you’re spending. Have you elevated your
lifestyle too much? Are you holding back out of fear of not having
quite enough money? If after a few months your payments aren’t
meeting your budget, talk to your originator about changing your
payment type. Maybe a sudden extra cost has come up and you
need to switch from monthly payments to a line of credit, or a 
term plan. Your originator is there to help, so if after the closing
things aren’t going as planned, call him right away to talk about
your options.

lthough much of this book is geared toward seniors who are
looking into reverse mortgages for themselves, there is a sig-
nificant population of adult children who are faced with the
prospect of helping to arrange a reverse mortgage for a parent or
other elderly loved one. Maybe you need to find out more before
you discuss the idea with your parent. Maybe your parents came
to you with the notion of reverse mortgages and you want to make
sure these loans aren’t a scam against seniors, who are so often
the targets of financial wrongdoings. Or maybe you just want to
find out what you can do to be there for your parents as they
travel down the reverse mortgage highway at full speed. If you’re
reading up on reverse mortgages for someone besides a parent,
you can mentally replace “parent” with that person’s name as you
go along. Either way, this chapter is for you. In the following pages
you can find tips to make this process as hassle-free for you and
your parents as possible and get some great resources for addi-
tional senior help. You can also find out the truth about reverse
mortgages, as we put to rest some common fears that adult chil-
dren have about reverse mortgages for their parents.
Many reverse mortgage borrowers are perfectly capable of getting
this loan on their own. Don’t assume that just because someone is
classified in our society as a “senior” they are automatically feeble
and confused. You know your parents better than anyone, so keep
in mind both their strengths and limitations before you step in to
help. If your parents can successfully secure their own reverse
mortgage without your meddling, step back and let them be.

Supporting Your Loved Ones
There may have come a time in your life when you suddenly
turned around and found that your role in life has changed. One
day you’re walking down the street, minding your own business,
and — boom! — your parents need you more than you need them.
Okay, maybe it’s a bit more gradual than that, but it can hit you
rather unexpectedly just as you’re sighing with the relief that your
own children have left the nest.
As your parents decide to go through the major financial transac-
tion of a reverse mortgage, they may need your support more than
they may have ever needed it before. In fact, this may be the first
time that you realize they need you at all. Just remember, if you
need help, ask for it. The reverse mortgage originator and coun-
selor are more than happy to talk to you one-on-one about the loan
(although they may not be able to divulge private financial infor-
mation without your parent’s consent).
Knowing when to stay out of it
The names on the deed to your parents’ house are your parents’
signatures, not yours. It can be very tempting to step in and take
over the finances for your parents — sometimes impossible to
resist because your parents are people that you care very much
about and you tell yourself that you’re only butting in for their own
good. The key words here, of course, are “butting in.” Remember
when you were a youngster and your parents would stick their
noses into everything you did? Remember how deflating it felt to
know that they didn’t think you were capable of doing something
on your own? Well, the tables have turned and your parents may
feel the same way if you step in without their solicitation.
Allowing your parents to make their own decisions at this critical
juncture in their lives not only empowers them in a world that is so
eager to make seniors out to be crazy old coots, it ensures that
they get what they want . . . not what you want. All children, adult
or otherwise, feel a sense of entitlement when it comes to their
parents. In this case, you believe, as they once believed of them-
selves for you, that you know what’s best for them. And maybe you
do. Since seniors run the gamut of 62 to 102-plus, their degrees of
comprehension and ability will vary greatly. Generally speaking, a
65-year-old is going to be much more aware and able than a 95-
year-old. Of course, there are always exceptions (that’s why we’re
speaking generally) so you have to be able to truly look at your
parents objectively (see the checklists later in this section).
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
180

We would never tell you to stay out of the reverse mortgage
process entirely unless your parents expressly wish it and are of
sound enough mind to complete a financial transaction on their
own. Instead, we encourage your participation on as grand a level
as you and your parents can tolerate. Just make sure that whatever
limits your parents set, you respect. After all, these are adults.
Your biggest role may simply be to hand them this book and say,
“Call me if you want to talk about this.”
You may also feel a twinge of guilt about suggesting a reverse mort-
gage for your parents in the first place; if the windfall will benefit
you, you won’t have to worry about them financially (or at least
not to such a great extent), nor will you be forced to inherit their
home since the majority of people sell it to pay off the loan. On the
other hand, you may feel selfish because you’re trying to convince
them not to get a reverse mortgage, since you’re afraid it will affect
your inheritance. These are both perfectly normal, common reac-
tions. And as long as you keep your parents’ needs and wishes in
the forefront of your mind and your needs and wants way in the
back, you should all come out on top. Try not to sway their deci-
sion too much, especially if your reasons are based on your own
agenda. Of course, we know you would never confuse your motives.
Have you ever heard the saying, “prescription without diagnosis 
is malpractice”? It means that giving someone a solution before
knowing what their problem is can only lead to bad results. Reverse
mortgages are a wonderful way for some seniors to live out their
lives in their homes, but it is not a panacea miracle pill. If you
haven’t yet, check out Chapter 2 and run down the list of when a
reverse mortgage isn’t the best option, as well as the pre-reverse-
mortgage checklist. You may discover that a reverse mortgage
doesn’t fit your parents as well as you thought. 
You also need to know your parents well enough to feel secure in
letting them go off and get a reverse mortgage alone. Some seniors
are just as sharp about finances as they were in their youth, and
some were never sharp with finances and can’t be expected to sud-
denly understand interest rates and falling equity. If you are look-
ing into reverse mortgages for a single parent, try to remember
back to who handled the finances as you were growing up. Was it
this parent? If not, is this one completely in the dark, or does he or
she have a pretty good grasp of his or her financial portfolio? It
may seem like we’re feeding into a stereotype, but many senior
women were never in charge of the money and have been left with-
out the tools to manage their own finances.
Take a moment to evaluate your parents by asking yourself the fol-
lowing yes-or-no questions. The more yes answers you have, the
Chapter 12: Supporting Your Parents 181

better equipped your parents are to handle a reverse mortgage
without your constant (loving) help. If you don’t know an answer,
skip it but try to find out after speaking with your parents (with
theses questions in mind), and then come back and evaluate them
again. The following checklists give you a great way to objectively
evaluate your parents:
 Financial Capability:
• Do your parents currently pay their own bills?
• Do they keep a balanced checkbook?
• Are they able to remember where their money is (for
example, savings accounts, investments, different banks,
and so on)?
• Do you feel that your parents could be trusted with a
very large sum of money?
• Are your parents able to keep track of their cash or does
it seem to “disappear?
• Are your parents savvy about senior con artists?
 Reverse Mortgage Understanding:
• Do your parents understand the basics of a reverse
mortgage?
• Was it easy to explain the rudiments of a reverse mort-
gage to them?
• Do they seem comfortable with the idea of reverse mort-
gages (not suspicious, scared, and so on)?
• Do they understand the cost of a reverse mortgage?
• Have they done a comparison of how much they need
per month versus how much they can get with a reverse
mortgage?
 Emotional and Mental Capabilities:
• Do your parents cope well with stress?
• Would you classify your parents as independent?
• Are your parents rational and free from (serious) mental
lapses?
• Are they able to live on their own today?
• Will they be able to live in their home for the next few
years (even with help)?

Discovering financial needs
There are as many reasons for getting a reverse mortgage as there
are seniors who need them. Some common motivations are:
 Daily living expenses
 A little extra cash to improve quality of life
 Medical needs, like prescriptions or hospital bills
 Renovating the home for safety or accessibility
 Remodeling for purely aesthetic reasons
 A dream vacation
 Purchasing a new home (with the Home Keeper for Purchase
loan; see Chapter 6)
 College tuition (often for a grandchild)
 A cushion to avoid draining a savings account
When you and your parents first discuss reverse mortgages, find
out what their plans are for the money and try to determine
whether or not these plans are realistic. Chapter 2 gives examples
of a daily living budget, and how practical a reverse mortgage is for
a senior’s goals. Flip back there and take a look at the sample
breakdowns of a monthly budget and a “wants” list. Then try the
exercise with your parent. It may take more than one visit to com-
plete, but it’s worth it once you and your parents can clearly see
what your parents’ wants are versus their monetary needs.
Once you find out why they need the money, brainstorm some
other options that may keep a reverse mortgage at bay for the time
being. If their needs are medical, make sure they’re receiving the
maximum benefits from Medicare, Medicaid, or other health plans.
If they need money to make ends meet, do some research to
ensure that your parents are getting the most out of social security,
Supplementary Security Income (SSI), and/or veteran benefits.
AARP is an excellent resource for all things elder, and can point
you in the right direction, depending on your parents’ individual
circumstances. You can find them online at www.aarp.org. You
may also want to enlist the help of a financial advisor who special-
izes specifically in senior needs. Your reverse mortgage originator
will no doubt have contacts in that field. If your parents’ reason for
seeking out a reverse mortgage is need-based, look to senior finan-
cial professionals to help you pad your parents’ pockets.
You may also be surprised to discover that your parents’ monetary
plans involve you. Maybe they want to help you buy a home by
Chapter 12: Supporting Your Parents 183

using their money to put a down payment on your dream house.
Maybe they want to help pay for your wedding or your child’s edu-
cation. There are also a group of seniors who strongly believe that
they need to have something to leave their family and want to put
the money away for you. This can be a treacherous area to get into.
Sure, most people would be hard-pressed to turn down the won-
derful gift of cash. But take a step back and consider what the
financial implication of this selfless act will mean for your parents
(and for you) down the road. 
Reverse mortgages are not free money. This is a loan and not only
does it have to be paid back in full when the senior dies or moves
out permanently, it has to be paid with interest, closing costs, and
additional fees as well. Interest and fees will most likely add up to
tens of thousands of dollars over the course of the loan. For exam-
ple, a $38,000 loan can accrue upwards of $20,000 extra in interest,
closing costs, and fees over eight years depending on the loan pro-
gram and interest rates. That’s pretty darn expensive. Ask yourself
if that price is worth the benefit of the loan. Do you really need
their help financially? If so, and they’re willing to give it, then con-
gratulations on your score. But if you don’t have to accept their
generous offer in order to achieve your goals, then support their
financial future by insisting that they use the money on themselves
(or look for other ways of helping you out).
On the other hand, you may find yourself in precisely the opposite
situation, whereby your parents need your help to make ends meet.
Think about the cost of a reverse mortgage for a moment and con-
sider whether you can find another way to assist your parents. Can
you spare a few hundred dollars a month? Would you consider
inviting them to live with your family? Is there anything you can do
to make their lives a little easier that would negate the need for a
reverse mortgage? Talk to your parents and your trusted financial
advisor to see if there is an alternative solution that can allow you
to partially or completely support your parents financially.
Chapter 5 details the process of paying back the loan; read up on
the conditions of repayment and make sure you understand your
part in it as well. Remember, if your parent passes away and termi-
nates the loan, you will most likely be responsible for making sure
it gets repaid. No one is going to come break your legs or repossess
your house on account of your parents’ reverse mortgage debt, but
they will expect you to get the appropriate affairs in order in a
timely manner. You and your parents need a financial plan when
the time comes. It’s not pleasant to talk about their impending
death, but you may be surprised to find that it bothers you more
than it bothers them.
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
184

Meeting emotional needs
Do you find that your parents call you more often than they used
to? Do they rely on you to sort out their day-to-day situations? It
can be hard to grasp, but you may have reached a point in the
circle of life where your parents start to count on you as their
translator for the world.
This is one of the biggest reasons that it is so important for you or
someone you and your parents trust to be present during all of the
reverse mortgage dealings. If you live out of the area, most reverse
mortgage counselors and originators will let you call in and sit
there on speakerphone while the meeting takes place (with your
parent’s permission, of course). If you can, however, try to send at
least one delegate from your family (you, your spouse, your
cousin, your own adult child) to all of the mortgage proceedings.
There will probably only be three meetings to attend:
 The counselor’s meeting: At this meeting, you find out about
the different loan options available in your parent’s state,
receive a clear printout of the estimated loan amounts and
costs associated with each option, and see which alternatives
exist that may better serve your parents. This is the first stage
in the reverse mortgage education process (aside from this
book of course), so it’s important that you get in on the
ground floor and start out with the best understanding possi-
ble of the particular loan your parents may be applying. This
is also a good chance to gauge how well your parent is retain-
ing the information they’re getting from the counselor. Forming
a relationship with the counselor on your part now will also
help you down the line of you have questions after the meet-
ing. (See Chapter 8 for more about the counselor’s meeting.)
 The originator’s meeting: By the time of this meeting, you
probably have a pretty good idea of which loan option your
parents want to pursue. The originator runs the numbers
again (rates will have changed by this point) and explains
again the finer details of what this loan will means for your
parents, specifically. If your parents decide to go ahead with
the loan at this point, an application is filled out and signed,
and the appraisal is ordered (you may or may not want to be
present for the appraisal — see Chapter 10 for more on the
appraisal process). If your parent decides to wait and think
about it, you may be in for an additional originator’s meeting.
(See Chapter 9 for more about the originator’s meeting.)
 The closing: This is the last stop on the reverse mortgage train.
At this meeting your parents sign off on all of their documents,
officially marking the beginning of the loan. Their closing costs
Chapter 12: Supporting Your Parents 185

are due at this point along with any additional originator fees
(unless they were financed as part of the loan). This is usually
the time when people realize the gravity of a new loan, and
want to back out. Your presence can make your parents feel
more secure in their decision, but, obviously, you shouldn’t
force them into anything they’re not ready for. (See Chapter
11 for more on closing.)
When you think about it, three visits really isn’t so bad, especially
since they will probably be weeks apart. Depending on how much
of a procrastinator your parents are, you may find yourself waiting
a couple of months between the counselor’s visit and the decision
to go see the originator. Unless they specifically don’t want you
there (and that’s their right) you should make every effort to be
around, even just your presence can be a reassurance. 
Of course, we don’t mean to imply even for a second that all sen-
iors are in need of hand-holding. There are plenty of independent,
vivacious seniors out there who will have no problem understand-
ing every element of the reverse mortgage process. Even so, be
aware of parents who can fully comprehend their new loan, and
those who are putting on a brave face and refusing help. Resist the
urge to smother them with help, and instead of demanding that
they let you be part of their mortgage proceedings, give them
some space and offer up your ear if they want to bounce any ideas
off you. If you truly feel that your parents are entering into a loan
without a complete understanding of the implications, by all
means step in and speak to the originator about your concerns.
For more about stepping in and taking the reins, see Chapter 14.
It’s easier than you think to be emotionally supportive of your par-
ents during the reverse mortgage process. Below we give you five
easy ways to be there for your parents as they embark on what can
be a scary transaction — try to do as many of the following as you
can (and more): 
 Talk to your parents before they decide to speak with a
reverse mortgage counselor so there aren’t any surprises in
the meeting. You don’t want to find out then that your mother
wants to use the money to get a face lift and chest, uh, expan-
sion. Talking to your parents beforehand also gives you an
opportunity to see how well your parents grasp the idea of
the reverse mortgage. Make sure you’re familiar with the dif-
ferent loan programs beforehand so you can help them weigh
their options.
 Go to the counselor session with your parent. If you can’t be
there in person then arrange for a phone teleconference. You
can help ensure that your parent is being honest with the
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
186

counselor about his financial needs, help explain difficult con-
cepts, and get an idea of where this transaction is heading. At
the same time, remember to respect your parent’s dignity as
adults. They may not be fast anymore, but they’re not toddlers. 
 Go along to the originator’s meetings. (Bet you saw that one
coming). You need to know for your own peace of mind that
this person can be trusted to advise your parents appropri-
ately, and that they are taking your parents’ individual needs
into consideration. Try not to give in to a knee-jerk reaction,
but do go with your gut feeling. Try to be present for the clos-
ing as well to look over the last-minute documents.
 Follow up with your parent after the loan closes. If they will
accept your help, go over their finances to make sure the loan
is providing enough money to meet your parent’s needs. Don’t
be the wallet police, but do also make sure that their lump
sum isn’t being spent faster than planned. This is also a good
time to talk about con artists and how to avoid being taken in
by a senior predator.
 Offer to arrange a meeting with a senior financial planner
who can help them manage their new-found funds. Your par-
ents need a plan of attack to make their money stretch, and a
professional may be able to offer up some suggestions for
investments, budgeting, and saving. We don’t have to tell you
this, but you ought to be there for that meeting, too.
Finding guidance
It may seem like a huge burden has fallen suddenly on your shoul-
ders, but you’re not alone. There are countless resources out there
that can help you with everything from finding an originator to
considering alternatives, to arranging aid for your parent. You can
take advantage of as many of these organizations as possible . . .
that’s what they’re there for. And remember, their job is to assist
you and your parents with their lifetime goals and day-to-day
living. They’ve heard it all and no question is a dumb question. If
one group can’t help you, they will almost always be able to steer
you toward the right path.
Ask your loved ones to help you out with doing the research. They
may not even realize that you need help — sometimes a few loud
sighs will do the trick, but you’ll usually have to come right out
and ask.
Checking out financial and quality-of-life assistance
Before applying for a reverse mortgage, you and your parents
should make sure that there aren’t other programs that would
Chapter 12: Supporting Your Parents 187

better meet their needs. Why pay thousands of dollars in fees and
interest when the government may give them extra money for a
lower cost (or even free!)? We give some places to start looking in
the list below:
 www.benefitscheckup.com: At this site, you and your par-
ents can fill out a confidential online questionnaire that
assesses which state and federal assistance programs your
parents are eligible for. These can range from extra monthly
income to food vouchers to health care. You can also apply
for the programs right from the Web site and get additional
information on each one. It’s definitely worth the Web visit.
 www.govbenefits.gov: Just to make sure you’ve covered all
your bases, check out this site. Although it’s the same idea as
benefitscheckup.com (see bullet above), it may produce vary-
ing results. It’s a good idea to try both systems, since one may
connect you with a program that the other one didn’t.
 Social security: Most seniors are already receiving social
security, but if you have questions about the program go to
www.ssa.gov. If your parents need to apply for their benefits,
start at www.ssa.gov/applytoretire or call 800-772-1213.
 Your parent may also be eligible for Supplemental Security
Income, which also comes from the government but is sepa-
rate from social security. This is designed for seniors with
practically nothing in their wallets and very little to their
names. To see if your parent qualifies, call the social security
office at 800-772-1213.
Finding alternatives to a reverse mortgage
In Chapters 2 and 8 we discuss some of the other loan programs
available to seniors that may be a better choice than a reverse
mortgage if their need is based on home repairs or certain taxes.
You can find more information in the aforementioned chapters, but
we’ve given you a peek at their basics in the list below:
 Deferred Payment Loan (DPL): The DPL is a state loan that
works a lot like a reverse mortgage — your parents borrow
money against their equity and pay it back upon leaving their
home permanently. The downside to this loan is that the DPL
can usually only be used to repair something dangerous or
unlivable in your parents’ home. Your state housing finance
agency can tell you whether or not these loans are available in
your area. To find your state’s housing finance agency, go to
the National Council of State Housing Agencies Web site at
www.ncsha.org/section.cfm/4/39. Remember that these
loans sometimes go by different names, but they should know
what you’re talking about once you describe the basics.
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
188

 Property tax deferral: Another state deferred loan is a prop-
erty tax deferral. If your parents owe back property taxes or
aren’t able to pay upcoming taxes, this loan may be their best
bet. One of the best features is that they often will only have
to pay back a portion of the loan, depending on your state. To
find out if this option exists in your parent’s area, call the
local agency that they send their property taxes to. They can
give you all the details on how the program works in that
state and go over qualifications.
 Traditional mortgage: Forward mortgages (traditional ver-
sions where you pay the lender instead of receiving pay-
ments) can be a good solution for some seniors. Popular
options are the Home Equity Line of Credit — which works
similarly to the reverse mortgage but with a very different
payment schedule — or refinancing with an interest-only ARM
(adjustable rate mortgage) which can lower payments in the
short term. However, because these loans require monthly
payments, they may not be the best for people who are
already struggling to make ends meet.
Seeking out reverse mortgage resources
Throughout this book we mention several ways you can find out
more about reverse mortgages and the people who provide them.
A few of the best resources are:
 National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA):
NRMLA has listings of all the reverse mortgage originators 
in every state who are members of the association. You 
won’t find recommendations or endorsements for any 
particular person or company, but it’s a great place to start.
You can also get informational packets, get an estimate of
what your parents could borrow with the reverse mortgage
calculator, and find links to other helpful sites. It’s all 
at www.reversemortgage.org.
 AARP: AARP is always an excellent source of information for
seniors, whether for reverse mortgages or any other senior
issue. Their Web site is easy to use and covers everything
from finding a job to finding adequate healthcare. For reverse
mortgage links, go to www.aarp.org/revmort. There’s a
reverse mortgage calculator, lists of approved counselors, and
much, much more. You can also be assured that they never
endorse any reverse mortgage product or lender, so you can
always get straight information.
While you’re there, check out www.aarp.org/money/
lowincomehelp/ for amazingly great tips on saving money,
senior discounts, government assistance, and more. It’s not 
Chapter 12: Supporting Your Parents 189

all reverse mortgage related, but it gives you some easy and
effective saving ideas for your parents.
 Lender’s Web site: Once you’ve decided on a loan product,
check out the lender’s Web site for more information about
the company and its loan. You can also find contact informa-
tion for future reference, just in case you need to reach them
with a concern.
 Loan product Web sites: To get specific information on a par-
ticular loan product, you can visit Chapters 5, 6, and 7 of this
book as well as the following Web sites:
• For Home Equity Conversion Mortgages, visit www.
hud.gov/buying/rvrsmort.cfm.
• For Home Keeper loans, go to www.fanniemae.com,
click on “find a mortgage” and then click on “reverse
mortgage.”
• For the Jumbo Cash Account, visit www.financial
freedom.com.
 Counselors and originators: Once you and your parents settle
on a counselor and originator, they can be flowing springs of
information and guidance. Come prepared to the meetings
with questions, and take lots of notes. Don’t be afraid to call
and ask questions afterward either. They want you to guide
your parents to make the best, most well-informed decision
they can. The originator and counselor also have lots of addi-
tional information about alternative or supplementary assis-
tance programs. Use their great wealth of knowledge — don’t
waste a single opportunity to satisfy your concerns. Besides,
if they’re getting paid, they ought to earn that fee!
Aging resources
Another outstanding Internet locale is the Administration on Aging
Web site (www.aoa.dhhs.gov). You can call them at 800-677-1116,
but we highly recommend a peek at the site. It’s not only clear and
simple to use, but it is a gold mine of information on everything
senior. It also has several language options, which is a big help if
you or your parent is more comfortable in another language. If
you’re new to caring for (or even about) an elder person, this site
has everything you need to know. 
Knowing the Name on the Deed
People tend to get a little suspicious when they hear anything
about the deed to their or their parents’ home. You may conjure up
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
190

images of a black and white movie in which a nice, hard-working
family loses the deed to the bank or to the town’s nefarious money
grubber. In fact, a reverse mortgage has nothing to do with that
kind of deed. There are three types of home deeds:
 Grant deed: This transfers property from one person or party
to another. The grant deed is the document that essentially
gives ownership to a property. In a sense it’s similar to the
title on your car. Remember in the ’50s when greasers would
race for pink slips? A grant deed is like the pink slip to your
home.
 Quit claim deed: This removes someone’s name from title or
ownership of a property. For instance, if a child’s name had
been added on title to their parents’ home, the child needs 
to sign a quit claim deed to remove his or her name so the
parents could obtain the reverse mortgage.
 Deed of trust: The deed of trust is the one that is recorded
with the county to secure a loan. This is the only one that can
affect a reverse mortgage and the only one you need to worry
about for our purposes.
A deed of trust does not transfer the property’s title. Your 
parents still own their home. The deed of trust also won’t
transfer to you, the heir, upon their death. That’s because,
again, a deed of trust doesn’t transfer anything. Its sole pur-
pose in life is to make note of your parent’s loan. If a deed of
trust climbed a mountain in Tibet to ask a great and wise Dali
Lama-type what the meaning of life was, the sage would reply,
“For you? Your purpose is just to record loans my child.”
A common misconception about reverse mortgages is that once
your parents sign the loan papers, the home belongs to the bank.
This couldn’t be further from the truth. Your parents keep the title
to their home until they choose to sell it, whenever that may be. 
This is a good place to mention that if you buy your parent’s home
from them, the reverse mortgage comes due, even if your parent is
still living in the home. To qualify for a reverse mortgage your
parent must own the home, live in the home, and maintain the
home. As we note in Chapter 2, some families choose to buy their
parent’s home and then allow the parent to continue living in it
rent free (or for a nominal fee). This solves a lot of the senior’s
problems, but unfortunately disqualifies them for a reverse mort-
gage. Your parent must be the homeowner.
If your parents qualify for a reverse mortgage, it stands to reason
that as of this moment, they own their home. Your parents’ signa-
tures on the deed of trust sustain this fact. Here’s where people
Chapter 12: Supporting Your Parents 191

start to freak out: The lender’s or servicer’s name is also on the
deed of trust. The lender or servicer’s name on the deed of trust
does not, not, not mean that the lender or servicer owns the home,
nor does it mean the lender or servicer has any rights to the home.
The lender or servicer’s name on the deed of trust simply signifies
that your parents have agreed to pay the lender or servicer back
on a loan. That’s it. The deed of trust has all the terms of the loan
embedded in the text and is signed by your parents (the borrowers),
the lender or servicer, and a notary public. Without your parents’
signatures, the deed of trust means nothing, since your parents are
the homeowners and the only ones who can set the loan in motion.
We can’t stress enough the fact that at no time can your parents’
home be taken away. This has been the biggest misconception
swirling around reverse mortgages since they resurfaced 20 years
ago, and unfortunately, that misconception is spread around more
often than the truth. You can start a new (and true) rumor: The
seniors own their homes in a reverse mortgage, not the lender.
They can’t take your parents’ home away. Pass it on.
Resting Easily
We all worry about the ones we love. That’s just part of being a
family. Reverse mortgages are all but worry-free, since they were
carefully crafted by lenders and government agencies to consider
all the little things that could go wrong and nip them in the bud
before they can sprout. There are several myths and concerns that
many adult children have for their parents when considering a
reverse mortgage. We spoke to several adult children whose par-
ents were considering reverse mortgages or who were looking into
the loans for their parents, and asked them to share their biggest
concerns. We’re going to attempt to set your mind at ease here,
with the most common fears answered in the following list:
 Your parents won’t be forced to live in an unsafe home. The
idea of your parents living in some sort of condemned struc-
ture actually couldn’t be further from the truth. Because of
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) laws, your parents’
home must be safe and sound. During the appraisal, your par-
ents find out everything that may potentially be wrong with
their home. Every reverse mortgage requires an appraisal, so
there’s no way to skip this step. What’s more, Fannie Mae
won’t even lend to people whose home needs more than 15
percent of repairs. In any reverse mortgage, all repairs have to
be made prior to the loan closing, or the lender withholds a
reasonable amount of the loan total so that your parents have
that money in reserve to make repairs after loan closing. No
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
192

lender wants to invest in an unsafe house; your parent will not
be left in a dilapidated shack. You can help by making sure
that your parents complete the mandated repairs within a
year of closing the loan.
 The bank will never take your parents’ home. Throughout
this book we repeat one of the most important facets of the
reverse mortgage: The bank/lender has no authority to take
your parents’ home away. None. Nada. Zilch. Zip. The home is
your parents’ and no one else’s. This myth stems from the fact
that many people choose to sell their homes in order to pay
back the loan when they move out (or their heirs sell it when
parents die). Lenders can demand loan payment in full if your
parents fail to hold up their end of the bargain (paying their
property taxes and keeping up home maintenance), but this
happens so rarely, it’s almost not worth mentioning. Even so,
they still can’t seize the home. Your parents are secure in
their home, which remains theirs until they want to sell.
 The money won’t run out. If your parents choose a monthly
tenured payment — one which continues at the same sum
each month for the life of the loan — their lender must con-
tinue to keep paying them indefinitely. If they hold the loan 
for 3 years, 7 years, or 20 years, your parents are entitled 
to receive payments until they move or upon their death.
However, if your parents choose a term loan, line of credit, or
a lump sum and use it all up, that will be the end of the line.
They need to consider carefully how long they plan to stay in
their home and how much money they need. You can help
with this by offering to go over their current budget and/or
bank transactions to see how their money is being spent, and
whether or not a reverse mortgage could feasibly cover their
expenses. See Chapter 2 for even more information on assess-
ing your parents’ budget as well as their needs and wants.
 They won’t have to make up the difference if their home
depreciates in value or the loan value exceeds the value of
the home. One of the greatest benefits of this loan is that your
parents never ever owe more than their home is worth. If the
loan balance comes to $180,000 at the end of a 17-year loan
and their home is only worth $150,000, $150,000 is how much
they owe. It’s a wonderful system, ensuring no out-of-pocket
expenses and no fear that they may have to sell any of their
treasured items or live in a refrigerator box under the freeway
because the loan tapped them out.
 The lenders can’t touch your inheritance. As we say in the
above bullet, your parents only owe as much as their home is
worth. That means that unless your parents spend it before it
gets to you, your liquid inheritance is safe. They may sell the
Chapter 12: Supporting Your Parents 193

home to pay off the loan, or they may choose to leave you 
the home and use other savings and investments to settle
loan costs. Either way, you won’t be left empty-handed through
any fault of the lenders. If your parents blow it all on little
porcelain figurines, well, that’s another story.
 Your parents won’t be cheated out of a fair loan value if
lending limits rise after their loan closes. In Chapters 5, 6,
and 7 we discuss the limits of each loan product — amounts
that the loans simply will not exceed, no matter the actual
value of the home. For example, in 2004, the upper limit for a
Fannie Mae loan was $333,700. In 2005 that figure changed to
$359,650. It’s likely that these limits will continue to increase
as the years go by. Seniors who have obtained a reverse mort-
gage may be able to refinance it in the future and obtain addi-
tional funds as a result of those increased lending limits.
 They will be protected if their home is destroyed. In 2004,
Florida saw devastation in the wake of hurricane after hurri-
cane. Because parts of Florida are considered a sort of Mecca
for seniors, home destruction is a very common concern.
Reverse mortgages require you to keep up homeowner’s
insurance; if the destructive force is covered under insurance,
the home will be rebuilt and your parent can continue to 
live there and receive reverse mortgage payments as per
usual. If the home was ruined by a force not covered by insur-
ance, disaster relief funds (such as those from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency) will often help to repair or
rebuild the home. If all else fails and there is no way to save
the home, lenders will consider the loan due, since the senior
is no longer living in the home. But! While there may not be a
home to sell to pay off the debt, there is property to cash in
on. In many areas, the greatest value is in the land, not the
home itself. If selling the land is not enough to pay off the
reverse mortgage, it becomes the lender’s problem, not your
parents’. Again, your parents can have no liability beyond the
value of their property. If their loan total comes to $89,000 and
what’s left of their home is only worth $5,000 then that’s all
they’d have to repay. Such circumstances are rare, but the
provisions are there just in case.
 No one will enter a mentally unfit senior into a loan. Many
adult children worry that their parents may run off and get a
reverse mortgage, when they know that their parents are
simply not capable of making such a huge financial decision,
whether from Alzheimer’s, dementia, or plain senioritis. In
almost all cases, the counselor is able to determine that your
parents don’t quite have the wherewithal to fully understand
a reverse mortgage. If your parents were somehow sly enough
to fool these highly trained professionals (or just having an

“on” day), the originator has another crack at making sure
your parent can handle the loan. They’re testing (not literally)
for understanding of reverse mortgages, as well as general
cognizance and orientation. An originator faced with a senior
who, in their opinion, can’t be held responsible for this loan
would likely ask them if they have any family or financial advi-
sors who may like to sit in on their meeting. This would
enable the originator to talk to the family and get a feeling for
how well the senior functions. It’s a basic tenet of any good
originator or counselor to know their client well enough to
assess their mental faculties.
Keep these reassurances nearby so that when a friend or family
member brings up any of these common concerns, you will be at
the ready. They can also guide you and your parents through some
fears you may have had. Chances are good that your parents have
thought of most of these potential issues as well.

Reverse Mortgage on 
Your Inheritance
In This Chapter

A
lthough most people don’t want to appear selfish about their
expected inheritance, most children want to understand how
a reverse mortgage affects their parents’ finances as well as their
own future inheritance. Of course, you don’t want to come off look-
ing like an entitled brat or materialistic prima donna when dis-
cussing your parents’ future and, eventually, their death. As a
matter of fact, it sounds utterly inappropriate. However, while we
don’t recommend you start rifling through your mother’s jewelry
box, you should have a firm grasp on your parents’ holdings,
including any debts (say, for instance, a reverse mortgage) as a
healthy, necessary, and crucial part of planning for your parents’
financial future.
Of course, many seniors aren’t ready to talk about these issues, or
will flat-out refuse to participate in any such discussions (whether
because they aren’t comfortable with the thought of their own
mortality or because they don’t think it’s any of your business). To
ease any tension surrounding the will, remember to respect your
parents’ privacy just as you would expect them to respect yours.
You can certainly suggest that they make out a will and ask that
they give some serious thought to their future finances, but ulti-

mately the reverse mortgage is your parents’ loan. Unless your par-
ents are at a point where they need considerable help with their
loan (see Chapter 14), allow them to transition into this discussion
slowly and delicately.
Remember that it isn’t the size of the inheritance that counts —
you may be surprised by what your parents have that you didn’t
even know about. Even if your inheritance consists of a toaster and
a pack of gum, you need to be prepared to take care of their
reverse mortgage debt before your parents are laid to rest. In this
chapter, we show you how to keep your inheritance and still pay
off a reverse mortgage that your parents left behind.
Repaying the Loan
There are three ways a loan can become payable: if the senior
moves out, fails to maintain the home sufficiently, or dies. Unless
you have durable power of attorney over your parents (more on
that in Chapter 14) the only time you need to worry about your
parents’ debt is upon their death. And here’s the good news: You
really have nothing to worry about. Reverse mortgages are designed
to make borrowing as easy as repaying so that anyone involved —
your parents, you, and any other family members — can rest easy.
Generally speaking, when a reverse mortgage holder dies (as in
any mortgage) the heirs are responsible for paying off the remain-
ing debt. Heirs can be anyone named in the will and aren’t exclu-
sive to family members. If you’re an heir, congratulations: You’ve
just inherited a reverse mortgage debt. How in the world are you
going to find tens of thousands — even hundreds of thousands —
of dollars to repay your parents’ loan? After all, the loan is due
ASAP, and the lender doesn’t take easy-pay installments. Don’t fret;
paying off the loan is simple, straightforward, and we guarantee
you can afford it. No matter how much you have in the bank.
The biggest point in your favor is that golden rule of reverse mort-
gages: You can never owe more than the home’s fair market value.
No matter how enormous of a loan your parents amassed, their
loan will never cost you more than the value of their home. And
don’t forget that if the loan is worth less than the home (for exam-
ple, your parent’s debt is $50,000 but their home is worth $425,000)
you keep the difference. That equity is yours (or else it belongs to
whomever it was stipulated to go to in the will).
Here are the ways in which you can pay off your parents’ reverse
mortgage (we discuss these options in more detail later in this 
section):
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
198

 Sell the home.
 Keep the home by:
• Paying the debt out of your own savings.
• Selling your house and moving right into your parents’
house.
• Taking out a new loan on your parents’ home.
Of course, you may have some other way to pay off the loan (lot-
tery, other inheritance, play the lender in a high-stakes game of
poker, and so on), but these are some of the more typical methods.
Whatever you choose just remember: plan, plan, plan. Get your
game plan in place ahead of time to save yourself added aggrava-
tion later. Do it during the loan application process so you can
involve the counselor or originator as well.
Selling the house
The most common way to pay off your parent’s home is to sell the
house because the home pays off the loan. You can never owe
more than the home is worth, so even if your parents have accu-
mulated $350,000 in loan debt, if the house sells for $235,000 that’s
all the lenders can ask of you. Of course you may actually get more
than you bargained for, too — if your parent has only accumulated
Chapter 13: Knowing the Impact on Your Inheritance 199
Keeping the estate
An “estate” in legal terms doesn’t mean the house: It means everything your par-
ents own. Their estate can include everything from cash, stocks, brokerage
accounts and IRAs to their furniture, heirloom rose bushes, and collection of teas
from around the world. Your parents own a home, so it stands to reason that they
own a few other things. No matter how much it turns out to be, anything that’s left
after you pay off the reverse mortgage and any other debts they had is your par-
ents’ estate. So, just because you may choose to sell the home doesn’t mean you’re
actually selling the entire estate — just the house.
We can’t emphasize enough that one of the most important things you can do for you
and your parents is to make sure that they have a will, which is especially crucial if
you have siblings. Even families who otherwise get along like saints find that the
gloves come out when the topic turns to inheritance. A reverse mortgage is usually
the responsibility of the adult children to take care of when a parent dies, but if your
parents leave the house to someone else, that person is responsible for repaying the
loan. You can imagine what a big help it is if everyone knows (or at least the parent
has written down) who gets what.

$59,000 in loan debt and the home sells for $375,000 you’re looking
at a hefty chunk of equity, which is part of your parents’ estate that
goes right into your pocket. We give some ideas in this section of
not only how to choose whether the house should be sold, but also,
some tips on making the most of the sale.
Deciding whether to sell the home
The thought of selling your parents’ home elicits different feelings
in every family. Consider the points below to help assess whether
you’re ready to sell your parents’ home. Not every statement begs
a “sell” or “don’t sell” conclusion, but it may put you in a more
focused frame of mind.
You may want to sell if:
 There will be equity in the home that you and your family
could put to good use. This is especially pertinent if there isn’t
much else in the estate. It’s also a good solution when there
are two or more siblings who want to keep the house, since
not everyone can live in the home at once. You may be able to
sell the house and split the equity, making everyone happy.
 The value of the home is less than the value of the loan. In
almost all cases, it just wouldn’t make financial sense to keep
a home with a depreciating value, which is often the situation
when the loan exceeds the home’s value. Besides, you won’t
have to pay the difference if the home is valued less than the
cost of the loan — the loan gets paid and no heirs will have to
pay out of pocket.
 The home is worth a lot more than the loan balance. Here’s
where equity comes into play again. If the loan is $89,000, why
keep a $675,000 home that no one in your family wants to live
in, pay taxes on, or maintain, when you could sell it and reap
the rewards of a low loan balance?
 You have no sentimental feelings toward the property. This
is especially true if your parent lives in a senior community or
recently bought a new home. If you never lived in the house
and it’s not particularly meaningful to you, there’s probably
no reason to keep it.
 No one in your family wants to move into the house.
Remember that if you keep the house, you have to do some-
thing with it. If nobody wants it, why not sell it to someone
who does? This is quite common since most adult children
are settled in their own homes and don’t need to move.
 You just don’t like the house. Enough said. You don’t like it?
Get rid of it.
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
200

You may not want sell if:
 You grew up in this home. These are the steps you had your
first kiss on, that’s the tree you used to camp under on warm
summer nights, this is the kitchen where you first learned
how to make paella with your grandmother — this is a special
house. They aren’t just walls, they’re memories. If this is how
you feel, keep the home if you can pay off the loan reasonably
(that is, don’t sell your kidneys on the black market to pay off
the loan).
 The home holds a special significance to you. Along the
same lines, this house may be meaningful, even if you never
lived there. It may be a historic home, or your parents may
have made enough renovations on it to make it truly unique. 
If you love it, don’t let it go.
 Your parents have specific wishes regarding the home.
Don’t discount your parents’ ideas about their own house. If
they want it to go to a charity and it says so in their will, don’t
sell it to someone else. Or if they wish for the house to stay in
the family, try to make it work. Of course, this is where a will
would be a handy thing to have, and another great reason to
discuss all this reverse mortgage stuff well before the loan is
even executed. You don’t want to find out that your mother’s
last wish was for you to have the home, but her second-to-last
wish was to blow all her money at the casino, leaving you to
come up with the cash on your own.
 You or another family member could live in the house. In
many families there’s a young newlywed couple who need a
starter home or an aunt who wants to be closer to the rest of
the clan, and your parents’ home is perfect for them. If this is
the case, you or whoever plans to move in needs to start plan-
ning for that now. Start saving to pay off the loan, and make
sure you (or whomever) can qualify for a loan to pay off the
rest when it comes time.
 The home has a low loan balance and is in an area with
rising home prices. Your parents may not know it, but they
could be sitting on a goldmine. We know a woman in
Pennsylvania who bought a beautiful home in 1967 for
$35,000, and didn’t know until she had her home appraised for
a reverse mortgage that the value had gone up over 25 times
its original price. Home prices were still rising when she
closed her loan, and six years later, when she moved to a
warmer climate, that was still the case. Her loan was a good-
sized $180,000, but her family knew that the home would soon
be worth over a million dollars. Her three children paid off the
Chapter 13: Knowing the Impact on Your Inheritance 201

loan as a group, and a few years later they each walked away
with over $300,000 in equity. If the home is a solid investment,
don’t sell yet.
 You can rent it out for a good price. Some areas of the coun-
try have rental prices at or above typical mortgage payments.
You may be able to take out a new loan to pay off the reverse
mortgage, and then rent the house at or above your monthly
mortgage payment, making it all but free as long as you have a
tenant.
 You can afford to pay off the debt some other way. Are you a
saver? Do you have a nest egg that you’ve been hoarding over
the years? You may be able to pay off the loan with your own
money, or with other inheritance. Consider carefully whether
it’s worth your stash to “purchase” your parents’ home. Just
because you can doesn’t mean you should.
Before anyone buys your parents’ house, they usually want to get a
more recent appraisal. Depending on the condition of the house,
you may want to invest in a re-appraisal yourself so you know what
you’re dealing with before your best buyer prospect figures out
that the roof leaks as of last autumn. This gives you a chance to get
in there and fix anything that can be fixed before trying to pawn
the home off on someone else. If you don’t live near your parents
or don’t visit as often as they would like, you may not be aware of
the state their home is in. Although the house may have been in
tip-top shape when the loan began, ten or so years of wear and
tear can do a number on a home.
Making payments for your parents before the loan is due
You can help lower that repayable amount (which increases the
potential equity you may receive) by helping your parents pay off
their loan as they go, as long as it’s allowed in their particular loan.
Broach the subject of offering help gingerly, as some parents dis-
like (or even resent) the notion that their children feel they need to
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
202
Protecting your investment
Paying off part of your parents’ loan is not only a weight off their shoulders, it will
be a weight off yours. However, you still need to protect yourself. Do you have other
siblings who expect an equal share of mom and dad’s equity? If you help pay off the
loan, make sure you get your money back when the home sells. No one likes to mix
family and money, and there’s a very good reason: It’s like mixing baking soda and
vinegar — explosive.

help them. Other seniors may think it’s a great idea and pass the
collections hat. Once you make a commitment, don’t go back on it.
You may skip a payment around the holidays when you need the
extra money, but the more you put in now, the less you have to
pony up later. You’re almost paying yourself.
If you decide to help your parents pay off the loan and they accept
your offer, we list a few ways to go about it. Neither is right or
wrong — it’s just a matter of what you and your family feel com-
fortable with. Also, keep in mind that any dollar amount helps. If
you can only help out with a few dollars a month, it may at least
cover the mounting interest. Take a look at the easy pay-as-you-go
ideas here, and then talk to your parents and other family mem-
bers to determine the best fit for your folks:
 Agree to pay a certain dollar amount each month to the
lender for as long as your parents keep borrowing. Send the
check directly to the lender or servicer (whichever is in
charge of your parents’ loan) so there’s no confusion if your
parents lose the money or can’t remember if it was ever sent
off. Ask your parents’ originator for the lender or servicer’s
contact information.
 Pay off a lump sum, not necessarily the lump sum your par-
ents borrowed (although if you have the money, knock your
socks off) but some large figure all at once. You may decide
to pay off an amount equal to that year’s interest accrual, a
few months of payments, or any random favorite dollar
amount.
 Choose an arbitrary dollar amount and work out a payment
schedule. You may get nauseated just thinking of handing
over $9,000 to help your parents pay off their reverse mortgage.
But over 15 years, that’s only $50 per month. If your parent
Chapter 13: Knowing the Impact on Your Inheritance 203
In a very nonthreatening and congenial way, get it in writing that when the house
sells, you are entitled to a return on your investment. You can ask your parents to
draw it up in the will or other legal document, and it’s best if your siblings or other
heirs are aware of the arrangement. You don’t want them all mad at you years from
now when they find out you’re getting a bigger piece of the pie.
Also remember that if your parents move out of the house for whatever reason, 
the loan becomes payable. If you’re helping your parents pay off their reverse 
mortgage as they go and you expect repayment when they sell the house to move
to Boca, be sure to work that into any documentation. On the other hand, you may
consider it a gift and simply write it off in your head as a nice thing to do for your 
parents.

lives longer, you’ve held up your end of the bargain and can
either step back or offer to keep up the payments. If they die
or move out of their home earlier than expected, you’ve still
put a dent in the loan.
 Convince other family members to pitch in and help as well.
They may do it out of the kindness of their hearts, or you may
have to explain it as an investment opportunity. Either way,
two households giving $50 a month adds up twice as quickly.
Or if you’re cash-strapped, take turns paying off little bits of
the loan. The more siblings and other contributors you have,
the bigger the impact on the loan repayment.
It doesn’t do you any good to pay off any part of the loan if your
parents spend that money all over again. Let’s take a line of credit
option for example. Your parents will have a set dollar amount to
draw from and only get charged interest on what they’ve used so
far. If they’ve borrowed $100,000 and you pay off $5,000 over time,
your parents should only owe the lender $95,000 (plus interest,
which is lower than the interest would have been in $100,000). But
if your parents respend that money, not only do they get charged
interest on the aforementioned $5,000, but they owe $100,000 all
over again. You may as well have given them the $5,000 to put in
their pockets. 
Keeping the house
A very common fear among heirs of reverse mortgage borrowers 
is that the lender can somehow swoop in and usurp your addi-
tional inheritance to pay off the loan when your parents are gone.
However, even if the loan value is larger than the home value, if
you sell the house all the lender can ever require of you is the 
selling price of the home. We can’t stress this enough: The lender
can’t come after your inheritance or any of your personal funds for
repayment. You, however, may decide that the best way to pay off
the loan is to dip into your other inheritance, if any.
You don’t have to be the heir to a dynasty to have money coming
your way. Although there are certainly seniors out there without 
a penny to spare, many others (and the numbers are increasing)
have saved up a little nest egg for retirement, emergencies, or 
perhaps to have something to leave you. Many people who lived
through the depression or remember their parents talking about
leaner times in their lives became almost chronic savers. Growing
up without the privilege of low-interest credit cards and without
the inherent need to shop online, seniors are often very good at
keeping their money safe and sound in the bank.
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
204

For those of you who have your hopes set on retaining ownership
of the house but don’t have any other inheritance money coming
in, using your own money may be your best option. If that’s the
case, you have a few options that make keeping the house possi-
ble: repaying the loan out of your own pocket, selling your own
home, or refinancing.
Repaying out of pocket
You may be able to repay the debt and keep the house if you have
enough money in the bank (or under your mattress) to repay the
lenders. Obviously this option doesn’t work for everyone — there
isn’t a huge percentage of people out there who can afford to plop
down a few “thou” willy-nilly. For those non-millionaires reading
this book, we list four situations below that usually allow you to
pay off the loan and retain the home for yourself:
 The loan balance is quite low. Your parents may have been
paying back the loan little by little as they received the money
from their reverse mortgage, or they could have simply had a
very small or very short-term loan. If your parents only held
their reverse mortgage for a year, you may only be looking at
$15,000 or so. Granted, it’s still a lot of money, but compared
to $100,000 it suddenly seems pretty manageable.
 You and your parents planned for this very occurrence and
you’ve been preparing to purchase the home for several
years. If you know your parents are getting a reverse mort-
gage and that you definitely want their home when they’ve
moved or passed away, you can start investing and saving
your money so that when the time comes, you and your
checkbook are ready.
 An additional inheritance covers the cost of the loan or
brings you very close to being able to pay it off in one fell
swoop. If it isn’t quite enough, you may have enough to sup-
plement it in your own savings or can take out a small loan to
make up the difference. This is another reason it’s a good idea
to know what’s coming to you, so you can be prepared to fork
over your monetary inheritance to pay the debt you’ve inher-
ited as well.
Paying off the loan yourself is usually something that must be
planned for and carefully orchestrated so that you feel comfortable
with the transaction. It takes all the fun out of becoming the owner
of your parents’ home when you have to sacrifice everything unex-
pectedly to keep it. You don’t want to be forced to sell the home
you live in just to keep the home your parent lived in, or at least,
not until you’re ready.
Chapter 13: Knowing the Impact on Your Inheritance 205

Selling your own home
If you know you want your parents’ home, you can sell your own
house to pay off the loan, essentially buying your parents’ home.
This is common when adult children are looking to downsize into a
more realistic house for one or two people after the kids have all
moved out and have stopped coming home quite so often. You can
sell your home, use that equity (which in many cases is more than
your parents’ home is worth) and pay off the loan. This circum-
stance is doubly good for you since it means no more mortgage
payments!
Refinancing
Another very common solution to paying off the debt is to refi-
nance, the same as you’d do with any other home. In effect, you’re
buying the house from yourself and taking out a new loan to do it.
When your parents got their reverse mortgage, they met with an
originator who showed them all of their options and laid out their
financial situation in black and white. An originator can do the
same for you: Let you know how large of a loan you qualify for,
which loan product is the best choice for you, and what your
options are within that product.
You can refinance with almost any type of loan, depending on how
much equity is in the home and how much you can afford. There
are countless loan products out there — more than we have room
to list. Since this is a book on reverse mortgages we won’t get into
the nitty-gritty details of every loan option (check out Mortgages
For Dummies for more details), but here are a few basics of the
more popular refinance loans:
 5/1 ARM: This loan keeps the same relatively low interest rate
for five years and then adjusts once per year thereafter. It can
be a good choice if you only plan to keep the home for five
years, or if we’re in a period of particularly low interest rates.
A warning: These rates can spike after your five years are up,
so keep an eye on the financial sheets.
 Interest-only: With an interest-only loan, you do just as it
says: You pay the interest only, for a certain amount of time.
These have become popular because they allow people
buying new homes to get “more house for their money” but
they carry a risk. Your payments go up quite a bit when you
start paying off the principal (the actual amount of the loan),
so you have to be prepared.
 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC): Like a reverse mort-
gage, this loan allows you to borrow against the equity in the
home; unlike a reverse mortgage, you have monthly payments
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
206

(just like any other loan). This loan can work well for people
who are disciplined with their money, but is sometimes not
the best choice if you plan to use the money for other things
in addition to paying off the reverse mortgage. Take a look at
Chapter 8 for more on the HELOC.
 15-year fixed rate: This loan is just like it sounds — you pay
the same interest rate for 15 years. This loan is a great choice
if you are more comfortable with a steady interest rate, but
don’t want a 30-year basic loan. You pay more per month with
a 15-year than a 30-year loan on the same house (simple math
can tell you that), but you can also have the house paid off
faster, which can make you very happy when you’re living in it
mortgage-free.
If you choose to keep the home by refinancing, you may be faced
with two mortgage payments at once: the one for your own home
and the new one for your parents’. Consider carefully whether that
kind of monthly check writing fits into the rest of your financial goals.
Making Sure Everyone’s 
on the Same Page
It’s never easy to sit down with a loved one and say, “So, when you
die, have you thought about what you’re leaving me?” It sounds
selfish and disrespectful to say the least. You may not be at ease
with the idea of your parent’s mortality, but chances are, they’re
just fine with it. No, they aren’t looking forward to that big bingo
hall in the sky, but it is a fact that they deal with every day.
The best way to plan for repayment is to plan ahead with everyone
involved (your parents and other heirs), and to plan way ahead —
as in, before the loan has to be repaid. This can be an uncomfort-
able topic for some, including yourself, but we give you some ideas
in this section to get everyone comfortable and agreeable to a spe-
cific repayment plan before the loan needs to be repaid.
Getting comfortable with “the talk”
If you are involved in the reverse mortgage process (and you
already know we recommend your participation highly) there
comes a time when you have to have a conversation with your par-
ents about what you should do if they die before the loan is repaid.
Below we give you some tips for opening up that dialogue before
they get a reverse mortgage:
Chapter 13: Knowing the Impact on Your Inheritance 207

 Before you even say a word, do your homework. Talk to
their counselor or originator about the rules of repayment
and prepayment. You want to know the facts before you start
giving out misinformation (however innocent), and then have
to go back and correct yourself later.
 Create a comfortable setting. If your parents are wary about
finance and need a lot of information, you may want to con-
duct this conversation with the originator or counselor pres-
ent. Or if your parents are largely independent, have it at their
home, over coffee, or at your house. Avoid talking about this
over the phone — it’s too impersonal.
 Start by asking your parents’ opinion about how they think
the loan is going to be repaid. You may be surprised to find
out that they’re already planning to repay as they go; or plan-
ning to sell and move to assisted living within a few years; or
they may have the mistaken notion that once they’re gone the
loan just goes away.
 Discuss repayment options. Depending on how much they
understand, you can either start explaining, in a non-patronizing
way, how the loan repayment works, or listen as they tell you
how they think you should pay off the loan upon their death.
 Approach the idea of selling their house gently if it is a
family treasure. When a home isn’t practical for any other
family members, it often doesn’t make sense to keep it for
memory’s sake, but your parents may be resistant to the idea.
Try to be open to their ideas if they’ve come up with scenarios
that allow you to keep the home and pay off the loan easily.
 Call in reinforcements. Your siblings, cousins, and children —
anyone who has a stake in the home — should take part in
this conversation, which takes some of the burden off you
(see “Keeping all the heirs in the loop,” later in this chapter,
for more information on making sure everyone stays involved).
 If your parent isn’t willing to discuss the matter, back off
and wait a few days before trying again. The important thing
is to get it out in the open before you’re left wondering how to
repay a loan your parents left behind.
Keeping all the heirs in the loop
Family dynamics can be tested when presented with such big deci-
sions, especially when there is more than one heir apparent (for
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
208

example, you and your siblings, your own children, or other rela-
tives). Reaching a common conclusion can be time consuming,
frustrating, and very emotional. Here are some tips for keeping the
peace as you figure out the best way to repay the loan:
 Include all heirs in every conversation. Leaving people out
makes them feel hurt that they didn’t get their say. Modern
technology makes it easy for several people to talk all at once,
even from remote locations. Don’t forget to include younger
relatives as well. Basically, if they have a stake in the home,
they need to be part of the decision.
 Make sure your parents are present. This is their home and
their money you’re talking about, and they should be there to
at least hear what your ideas are. Ask their opinion, and find
out (if you can) what kind of additional inheritance you can
expect. A sizeable amount may be the solution to keeping the
home and paying off the loan. Talking openly like this can help
your parent plan ahead as well. This is also a good time to
mention their will and whether or not it is up-to-date (includ-
ing any new grandchildren, excluding anyone who has died
since the last revision). 
 Check your ego at the door. You may be the oldest, or the
favorite, or the one with the most business sense, but your
family has a right to have their voices heard, too — even your
hippie sister and video-game-playing brother. You or someone
else in the family may want to play “moderator,” but no one
should have a dictatorship.
 Keep an open mind. Everyone comes into a meeting like this
one with some idea of how they think the loan should be
repaid. Try to stay open to their ideas and come to a compro-
mise if possible. Bring some notes (as well as this book!) on
your different options and be ready to offer up some informa-
tion that could help educate others, but be ready to hear
others’ viewpoints as well.
 Don’t give up if things aren’t going well. Deciding how to pay
off a loan, whether to keep the home, and how to dispense
with equity is stressful to say the least. If the conversation is
at a standstill, take a break. Go out for coffee, take a walk, play
a game, anything to get your mind off of reverse mortgages for
an hour. Then come back and try again. Talking about loan
repayment may not be a barrel of laughs, but working the plan
out before the time comes to implement the pay-back plan is
worth it.

Taking advantage of renters’ “insurance”
One of your options when the responsibility of the reverse mortgage falls to you is
to refinance the home with a traditional forward mortgage and rent out your par-
ents’ home. A mortgage originator can let you know what your refinance options
are, but the popular mortgages these days are interest only (where you only pay the
interest on the payment for a specified amount of time) or adjustable rate mortgages
(also called ARMs, which have a lower interest rate that changes more frequently). 
Once you’ve repaid the reverse mortgage, the house is yours to do with what you
wish. Renting out the house can be a good choice, especially if you want to keep the
home in the family but no one is ready to move into it quite yet. Whatever you charge
in rent should equal or surpass your new mortgage payment, so it’s kind of like get-
ting the house for free. There are certain tax and legal implications when you rent
out a property, so make sure you know all the facts before you take on the title of
“landlord.”

of Attorney

F
or adult children who are concerned that their parents’ mental
state may keep them from being eligible to take advantage of 
a reverse mortgage, you may not be aware that there are options
out there that can help you help your parents. Parents who have
Alzheimer’s, dementia, or other mental incapabilities may be phys-
ically able to stay in their homes, and wish to remain where they
are. In fact, many seniors with mental dysfunctions would be
unnecessarily agitated by being moved. A reverse mortgage can
help your parents enjoy life in the home they love, even if they
aren’t quite lucent.
One of the most common ways to do this is with a durable power
of attorney. When you (an adult child) get durable power of attor-
ney over your parents, you are entitled to make large-scale finan-
cial decisions on their behalf unless the written durable power 
of attorney says otherwise. This way, you can help your parent
receive the benefits of a reverse mortgage without tearing your
hair out trying to make them understand the concepts. In this
chapter, we give you tips for recognizing mental incapacity, what
your durable power of attorney allows, and how to get the help
you and your parents need.

Understanding Power of Attorney
One of the unofficial requirements for a reverse mortgage is that
borrowers must understand the basic principles of the loan and all
of the implications that go along with it. In short, the borrowers
have to know what they’re getting into. The loophole that allows
you to give your parents the comfortable life they deserve is a
durable power of attorney. By definition, a power of attorney is writ-
ten permission for someone else to act on another’s behalf. 
Almost every state in the country requires that a power of attorney
is durable, which means that it goes into effect when the papers are
signed (or on a date specified in the official paperwork) and that it
stays in effect if your parent becomes incapacitated. The only way
it is revoked is if your parents revoke it or if the paperwork specifies
a date on which the powers are revoked. Your parents can specify
what powers the durable power of attorney actually covers. 
Whenever we talk about power of attorney in this book, we use the
term durable power of attorney, since it’s not only required by most
states, but is the safest and smartest way to go. We’re also assum-
ing that you’re looking for durable power of attorney for a parent,
but the same rules apply no matter whose affairs you’re looking to
manage.
When dealing with durable power of attorney proceedings, you
may also hear the term springing power of attorney. This is actually
another kind of durable power of attorney, but with one key differ-
ence: The springing power of attorney doesn’t go into effect until
your parent is incapacitated. This can be good for seniors who
want to retain independence until their last synapse pulls in at the
station, and at the same time takes some of the pressure off you
because you have time to get used to the idea before jumping in
with both feet. But take heed; we don’t recommend a springing
power of attorney in many situations, particularly because it’s not
always clear that a senior is, in fact, unable to take care of his or
herself. Because of this, it can be difficult to find institutions that
accept the power of attorney without additional documentation,
which just means a headache for you. In addition, unless your
parent becomes suddenly or completely unquestionably incapaci-
tated, a springing power of attorney could land you in a battle with
other family members who disagree that mom or dad is unable to
care for him or herself anymore.
You can see for yourself the benefits of a durable power of attor-
ney versus a couple of alternative power of attorney forms in Table
14-1 below.

Assessing what your 
power may cover
When you hold durable power of attorney, you often have more
control of your parents’ lives than you ever thought you would (or
ever wanted). Any major decisions your parents otherwise made
on their own you are now allowed to do. If you’re getting durable
power of attorney expressly to apply for a reverse mortgage, con-
sider whether or not you want this power to be exclusive to the
loan, or across the board for all financial and real estate matters
(not to mention medical decisions). A durable power of attorney
that covers all aspects of finances gives you the power to:
 Apply for a reverse mortgage.
 Oversee and sign tax forms and returns.
 Open a bank account.
 Make donations.
 Pay yourself.
 Manage existing accounts, pensions, insurance, and health care.
Chapter 14: Getting Durable Power of Attorney 213

In many cases, you or your parent is uncomfortable with all that
power. After all, you’re pretty much taking over another person’s
life. That’s why you also have the option to do a limited durable
power of attorney, which would either specifically include or
exclude certain privileges. 
Without a limitation clause, the durable power of attorney pretty
much allows you to do whatever you like. The laws are very broad
and far-reaching in most states. Because of this, whether you
choose a general or limited durable power of attorney, be as 
specific as possible in the wording. An elder law attorney (see
“Finding an Elder Law Attorney,” later in this chapter) can guide
you through spelling out your and your parents’ wishes.
Knowing your responsibility
We would never accuse you of being selfish. After all, if you’re read-
ing this you obviously care about the well-being of your parents.
But you may be wondering what your role is in the durable power
of attorney and how your parents’ loan affects you if you are the
one who initiates and executes it.
First and foremost, you can’t be held personally responsible for
your parents’ debts, even though you are the one with durable
power of attorney, because you are signing on behalf of their
estate. When you sign anything for your parent, including the
reverse mortgage documents, you sign Chelsea Child as “an agent”
for Susie Senior or Susie Senior, as Chelsea Child, “attorney in fact.”
There are a few variations on the signature format, but the idea is
the same; as long as your reverse mortgage originator accepts the
signature, you’re good to go. This “dual” signature absolves you of
the responsibilities incurred on your parent’s name, but it does not
give you license to sign off on things for yourself all over town,
using your parent’s name . . . okay, technically it may leave you
open to that sort of debauchery, but don’t do it. You’ll land your-
self in a heapin’ helpin’ of legal trouble.
Bigger than the signatures, of course, is the knowledge that you
have a tremendous level of power over your parents. If the thought
of this makes you rub your hands together like an evil villain, you
are not the person for the job. You need to have the patience, time,
morals, basic legal understanding, and mental stamina to take
responsibility for your parents’. You may be the one who signs off
on the loan documents, manages their budget, keeps an eye on any
investments, staves off senior scam artists, doles out birthday
money, in short, everything you do for yourself times two.
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
214

If all else fails and you decide that you are really not cut out to
hold a durable power of attorney, your wingman can take your
place. Most durable power of attorneys name an agent (you) as
well as a “just in case” successor. This covers you if you want to
step out of the equation, or become incapacitated in some way
yourself, which just may happen if you let all these reverse mort-
gage transactions drive you crazy.
Determining Necessity
It can be heartbreaking to look honestly and candidly at the person
who raised you — who kissed your scraped knee, helped you with
your homework, and embarrassed you in front of your friends —
and know deep down that they are no longer able to take care of
themselves. It’s hard, it’s sad, it’s scary, and it’s easy to settle into
denial about the whole thing. Not facing the facts doesn’t help
anyone and can make things worse for a parent who needs some
extra care.
If your parent has gone to a reverse mortgage counselor who felt
that mom or dad was unable to understand the basics, or you
already know that there’s no way you could explain declining
equity to them, your durable power of attorney may be the ticket
to their financial security. By using the money from a loan, they
may be able to afford in-home care or a paid companion who can
just hang out and make sure no one leaves the stove on overnight.
Going through a behavior checklist
We all have odd moments where we realize we’ve just put the milk
in the cupboard and the cereal in the fridge. Everyone loses their
keys and discovers them someplace completely random, and
everyone has spent 45 minutes looking for their eyeglasses, only to
find them sitting conveniently on their own head. These aren’t
signs of incapacitation, that’s just life. But there are some clues
that you can’t ignore. Look at the list of common mental incapacity
traits below with an open mind; not every point is an indicator of
diminished mentality, but add a few together and you need to seek
professional guidance. 
As you go down the list, try not to make excuses like “she’s always
been that way” or “he doesn’t do it that often.” Being honest with
yourself about your parent is the best way to help them on the road
to getting a reverse mortgage. 
Review these indicators:
Chapter 14: Getting Durable Power of Attorney 215

 Poor memory that just keeps getting worse
 Asking the same questions over and over
 Initiating the same conversation over and over
 Making bad decisions that could be harmful, such as walking
five miles to the grocery store in the rain at night
 Having a sudden change in personality, good or bad
 Misplacing money
 Buying the same thing several times (before it’s needed again)
 Being unable to make a decision, or having a blasé attitude
about things
 Being often confused about place and/or time
 Being unable to plan for the future, even a day or a few hours
in advance
 Forgetting basic personal hygiene and/or not taking interest in
their own appearance
If your parent is exhibiting a few of these signs, that should be your
trigger to get help; schedule a doctor’s appointment, then if neces-
sary, take the next step and get durable power of attorney. With
the income from a reverse mortgage and you at the helm, you can
ensure a safe and comfortable life for your parent, even if they
don’t seem to realize it.
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
216
Understanding that patience is a virtue
A senior with mental incapacities (full or partial) can be trying. It’s hard enough to
come to grips with an aging parent, but when their behavior starts to send you over
the edge try to remember that they’re still your parents. Seniors with dementia or
other mental illness may not always know exactly what’s going on, but they do know
when things are going well, or something’s not quite right. They still have feelings
and emotions. They are not trying to aggravate you on purpose. When they ask two
dozen times where you got your sweater, it’s not to be annoying and it’s not to get
attention.
Most importantly, it’s not their fault. No one asks to lose their mental faculties. It can
be just as scary for them to experience as it is for you to watch. Summon all your
kindness, patience, and composure and try your hardest to listen, smile (or whatever
the appropriate expression is), and help them feel at ease. Remember not to lash
out at your parents — this only knocks down their trust in you and could ignite an
undesirable reaction from them. Just keep saying to yourself, “It’s not their fault.”

Taking the first steps
Once you’ve determined that your parents need a little (or a lot of)
help, your first move should be to get an elder law attorney and sit
down with your parents and the lawyer to discuss what level of
durable power of attorney you need. Talk to your parents ahead of
time so that they aren’t taken off guard. Many seniors are less than
receptive to the idea of you taking over their lives, but honesty
really is the best policy here. If they are extremely resistant, go
alone and get all the information you can without them present,
and then explain it all in a more secure setting (like their own living
room). It’s not ideal, but if you’re not getting anywhere with firm
yet gentle insistence and don’t want to pick them up and carry
them there, making the first visit alone is a good alternative. For
heaven’s sake, don’t tell your parents that you’re taking them to
the ice cream parlor and then pull up in the attorney’s parking lot.
It’s not just a mean trick, but it also starts to destroy trust — which
is one thing you need plenty of if you’re going to convince your
parents that you need to have durable power of attorney. 
Never explain that you’re going to “take care” of your parent or
that you “know what’s best” for them. Your parents probably won’t
take kindly to being treated like a child, and may (ironically) rebel,
just like a child would. Instead, use words like “help manage your
loan,” “give you a hand with your checkbook,” and “protect your
money.” These are much less threatening phrases that may be
received more positively. 
Afterward, contact a reverse mortgage counselor (Chapter 8 can
tell you where to find a good one) and set up an appointment to
meet. Explain on the phone that you have durable power of attor-
ney, although they will probably still want to speak to your parent
on the phone before making the appointment. If you have durable
power of attorney you must be present for the counselor meeting. 
If you look over at your parent during the meeting and they seem
to be staring out the window, try to focus their attention back to
the topic at hand. Do this three times, and if they can’t seem to pay
attention or aren’t grasping the concepts enough to take interest,
just let them be. Don’t try to oversimplify the ideas of a reverse
mortgage, because it may come off scarier than it actually is. If you
have full durable power of attorney, your parent can flip through a
magazine for the whole session and it wouldn’t make any differ-
ence. However, if your parent seems to be trying to understand the
reverse mortgage concepts, your counselor will be able to break
down the ideas into easy, mentally digestible pieces. We don’t have
to tell you that if your parents seem to understand the basics of a
Chapter 14: Getting Durable Power of Attorney 217

reverse mortgage and are ardently against it, don’t proceed. Your
counselor can also help you assess your parent’s reaction and
direct you on how to go from there.
Remember that as the durable power of attorney agent, you’ll need
to be present at all meetings so you know what’s going on at all
times. If you could send your parent alone, you probably wouldn’t
need to have durable power of attorney. 
Finding an Elder Law Attorney
Although law doesn’t require you to have an elder law attorney
prepare your durable power of attorney documents and preparing
one on your own can save some cash in the very short term, lacking
the legal knowledge to create a durable power of attorney for prop-
erty management can cost you thousands, if not more, because of
common mistakes or loopholes. A durable power of attorney needs
to be tailored to your specific circumstances in order to be the most
effective document possible. We don’t recommend that you draft
your own durable power of attorney, and we hope that you consider
carefully the potential problems with do-it-yourself forms and kits.
Most lawyers don’t specialize in serving a particular type of person.
Criminal lawyers may have a knack for people with similar hobbies,
say, knocking over liquor stores, but they don’t focus on a precise
segment of the population like an elder law attorney does. You may
be tempted to use your own lawyer to oversee the durable power
of attorney. This is common, but usually not the best choice.
Here’s why:
 General practice attorneys may buy into the myths that go
along with old age. They may patronize a perfectly aware
senior, talk loudly for no reason, or ignore them all together.
 Elder law attorneys have connections in the world of senior
citizens, from in-home assisted living providers to gerontolo-
gists (senior doctors), senior-care psychologists, government
program information, and more.
 General practice attorneys may not be familiar with all of the
subtle aspects of a durable power of attorney, especially in
relation to a reverse mortgage.
Your general family lawyer will probably be able to refer you to a
good elder law attorney, however, so don’t scratch them out of
your phone book quite yet.
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
218

Knowing what to look for
Part of what makes finding a good elder law attorney somewhat 
difficult (besides the fact that there may not be one in your area if
you live in a small town) is that there are so many fields of elder
law. Different elder law attorneys specialize in all sorts of areas:
medical claims, social security issues, estate planning, elder abuse,
age discrimination, nursing home problems, and elder fraud, just
to name a few. When you call around, be sure to explain up-front
that you’re looking for someone with experience in creating
durable power of attorney authorizations, who is also knowledge-
able about reverse mortgages.
And speaking of that first call, this is a good time to ask some pre-
liminary questions. You may be speaking with a receptionist or
assistant, but it’s okay — that person should be able to spout off
the answers without missing a beat.
Some good first questions to ask include:
 How long has the attorney practiced elder law?
 What associations is he or she a member of?
 What should I bring with me when I come in?
 What is the fee structure? Does that include the first 
consultation?
In fact, ask anything you want; just remember that the person
answering the phone probably isn’t a lawyer, so it’s best to save
detailed questions for the attorney. Once you’re in and have
explained your reason for coming, lay on the more difficult ques-
tions. Start with, “Have you ever done a durable power of attorney
for a reverse mortgage before?” Don’t be shy — if you don’t under-
stand something the first time, just keep asking until you do. You’re
on the clock, but it’s worth it to get a satisfactory answer.
Some sample questions to take with you may be:
 What are the downsides to getting durable power of attorney
in our particular situation?
 What provisions do you recommend to the written durable
power of attorney?
 Judging by our conversation, do you think there are any
better alternatives to getting durable power of attorney we
haven’t thought of?
Chapter 14: Getting Durable Power of Attorney 219

 After seeing my parent in person, do you feel that a durable
power of attorney is appropriate?
 How long does it take before the durable power of attorney
goes into effect? (This may depend on who draws up the
paperwork and the office’s turnaround time.)
 How often should we revisit the durable power of attorney
documents?
Since the answers to these questions can vary from family to
family, we can’t give you definitive answers here; that’s why it’s so
important to discuss these issues (and any others you can think
of) thoroughly with an elder law attorney.
In addition, your elder law attorney must possess the same quali-
ties that a good reverse mortgage counselor or originator has:
patience, respect for seniors, and superb communication skills.
Just like you would with an originator, you and your parents need
to feel that you can ask questions, get results within the promised
timeframe, and receive personal attention that shows they care
about you beyond your checkbook.
Elder law attorneys (like any other lawyers) usually charge by the
hour or part thereof, plus whatever expenses they incur on your
behalf (like making copies or mailing something). Fees will vary
from office to office, but can run as low as $50 an hour at very gen-
erous offices with senior finances in mind, to as high as a few hun-
dred dollars an hour. Discuss your financial situation with your
attorney right off the bat. If you can’t afford their high fees, many
elder law attorneys may very kindly lower their rates or reduce the
billable hours. After they tell you their rate and give you an esti-
mate of how much the total cost will be, level with them — tell
them how much you can spend, and ask nicely if they think they
can help you stay within your budget. Most will, but many won’t
assume you even have a budget unless you say something.
You can make the experience of creating a durable power of attor-
ney a positive one by being sure to bring all of the documents,
statements, or other items that the elder law attorney requests of
you. If your parents have already gotten their reverse mortgage,
bring all the loan documents, including the Loan Agreement, which
lays out all of the terms of repayment. You can also ask the reverse
mortgage originator you’re working with (or plan to work with) for
sample copies to take with you so the elder law attorney knows all
the details of the loan.

Finding a good elder law attorney
Beyond flipping through pages of “Call for a free estimate” ads that
make your legal issues sound like a broken-down car, there are
countless resources available to you that can help you find a highly
regarded elder law attorney in your area. Remember, you don’t have
to go with the first attorney you talk to, and you don’t have to worry
about hurting their feelings if you choose someone else. At upwards
of $250 an hour, they can use their wads of cash to dry their tears. 
Some great places to start searching include:
 National Association of Elder Law Attorneys (NAELA): It may
come as no surprise that the NAELA Web site is a great place
to start when you’re looking for an elder law attorney. Its
“Locate an Elder Law Attorney” database has listings of
NAELA members all over the country, some with information
such as law specialties and links to their own Web sites where
you can find out more about each attorney. Visit the site at
www.naela.com or call 520-881-4005.
 American Bar Association (ABA): The “Senior Lawyers
Division” of the ABA provides a directory of state and city
senior lawyer groups in the U.S. The ABA Web site also has an
option to search for lawyers by specialty. Find the ABA’s
senior groups at www.abanet.org/srlawyers/.
 Alzheimer’s Association: Not only will you find incredible and
up-to-date information about Alzheimer’s tips and recent
research on its Web site, you can also contact your local chap-
ter, which can most likely give you a referral to a competent
elder law attorney. Visit www.alz.org or call 800-272-3900.
 AARP: AARP is an excellent resource for all facets of aging,
and here you can find that AARP really shines. Log on to www.
aarp.org/money/legalissues/ to discover a “Find a Lawyer”
link, plus an option to receive 30 minutes of free legal advice
from one of AARP’s network attorneys. If your parents are
members, they can receive additional reduced-fee services.
While you’re on their site, check out the reverse mortgage links.
 Children of Aging Parents (CAPs): This non-profit organ-
ization has resources for many aspects of managing your
parent’s affairs. Its chapters are only in about 15 states, but
this organization may be able to help you contact a similar
group in your own area. Call them at 800-227-7294 for support
and suggestions.
Chapter 14: Getting Durable Power of Attorney 221

Knowing Who Gets the Check
And now the moment you’ve all been waiting for . . . the money.
Depending on which loan you and your parents have chosen and
which payment method works best in your family’s individual situ-
ation, that reverse mortgage could come in the form of tenured
monthly payments (for the life of the loan), term monthly pay-
ments (for a specific amount of time), a line of credit, a lump sum,
or any combination of these. In this section we cover where that
money goes when you have durable power of attorney as well as
who gets that check.
Lining your parents’ pockets
Although you’re the agent for the durable power of attorney and
you sign the checks in your parents’ names, the reverse mortgage
is in your parents’ names. So any funds come in your parents’
names, even if you signed as your parents’ agent. If they’re receiv-
ing mailed checks, the payments come to your parents’ house. If
they chose to have direct deposit, the funds must (no bending on
this rule) go into an account with the parent or parents’ name(s)
on it.
Having the payments from a reverse mortgage deposited electroni-
cally into your parents’ bank account is easy and a real time saver
(see Chapter 4 for more information). Your parents don’t have to
run to the bank or worry about checks getting lost in the mail.
Another advantage to electronic automatic deposits is that you
won’t have to worry about your parents accidentally throwing the
checks away with the day’s junk mail, or losing it in a stack of mis-
cellaneous papers. The money always goes directly where it
belongs: in the bank.
Your powers may not come into play for quite a while if your par-
ents are still cognizant enough to spend those reverse mortgage
payments on their own. If you’re fortunate enough to be in this sit-
uation, use this time to watch your parents’ spending carefully.
This financial voyeurism has two significant benefits:
 You can see how your parents spend their money and use the
patterns to model your spending when it comes time to take
the reigns.
 You can monitor their accounts for abnormal spending, which
may be a warning sign that things “upstairs” are getting
worse.
Part IV: Giving Advice for Adult Children 
222

Use this chance to monitor your parents’ spending habits and get a
better understanding of what they buy, how well they keep their
accounts balanced, and what their usual budget is. It can be a
tremendous help when you’re trying to manage it later on.
Spending the money that you’ve been appointed a durable power
of attorney agent for is a serious responsibility. Depending on the
state of incapacitation your parent is in, you may have to decide
what they would want done with that cash on a larger scale than
just paying bills. That’s why it’s crucial to talk about these sorts of
things before the fact and write them into the durable power of
attorney. For example, your parents may have made an annual
donation to the Sierra Club before you took over. If it’s written into
the durable power of attorney that this is to continue, you need to
carry on the tradition. Or your parents may wish to make invest-
ments with their reverse mortgage. Would you know where to put
that money? Would you feel responsible if the market tanked and
your parent’s investments were lost? If you need help managing
your parent’s money, ask a well-respected family member, friend,
or (ideally) a financial planner who is familiar with durable power
of attorney and senior finances.
Putting the money into the bank
Of course, in order to fulfill the duties set forth in the durable
power of attorney, you need access to your parents’ accounts. How
can you be expected to manage their money if you don’t have any
way to get to it? The answer is a joint account. You have probably
had a joint account in the past, either with a business partner,
spouse, child, or maybe even your own parent when you were
young. When the funds from a reverse mortgage go into a joint
account, whoever is on the account (the fewer people the better)
is able to access it just like any other bank account; you can write
checks, pay bills online, and make deposits among other things.
Depending on the type of account and the provisions made in the
durable power of attorney, you may need your parents’ signatures
on some transactions. For instance, it may be written into the
durable power of attorney that for any amount withdrawn over
$500, your parent needs to sign off on it, too. Some families elect a
third person to be named on the accounts and stipulate that for
any big purchases, both the agent (you) and the third person have
to approve it. There are endless combinations of account man-
agers that can help make sure your parents’ money is safe, sound,
and being spent on what it was intended for: them.
Chapter 14: Getting Durable Power of Attorney 223

If you see dollar signs dancing before your eyes, stop right there.
One of the ways the banks and other fiduciary organizations have
developed to protect your parents’ money is to prohibit you from
combining your bank account with theirs. This is actually a fairly
common mistake (which doesn’t make it okay). Many durable
power of attorney agents think they’re making a smart move by
blending their bank account with their parents’. Although most
banks won’t throw you in jail for a seemingly innocent offense, you
may be looking at fines or other punishments, depending on the
severity of the account misuse.
Unfortunately, there’s no foolproof way to safeguard your parents’
money against, well, you. People in the reverse mortgage industry
are always concerned about their customers’ wealth being used
prudently by the adult child who executed the loan. There are
cases of inappropriate use that certainly don’t apply to the popula-
tion at large, but it does happen. Your parents’ reverse mortgage
originator and counselor’s first priority is to their customers: your
parents. That’s why they often request a note from your parents’
physician that explains the terms of the durable power of attorney
in addition to the documents themselves.
Don’t be surprised if your parents’ originator, counselor, and even
the title company look over the durable power of attorney meticu-
lously. It’s not a judgment on you or your intentions — they all
have to be sure that the wording in the documents states that you
are, in fact, legally allowed to take out a loan on someone else’s
house. You’d want them to check that out if someone were trying
to put a lien on your house, wouldn’t you?
Whether the originator remembers to ask for it or not, you must
bring a copy of the durable power of attorney (signed and notarized)
to the originator’s office in order to apply for a reverse mortgage
using your durable power of attorney privileges. In some states, you
must also bring a doctor’s note that states that your parents are, in
fact, incompetent. Check with the originator before your first visit
to make sure you have all the forms and documents you need —
you’re busy enough without making extra trips to the originator’s
office. Once there, the originator gives a copy to the title company
for its records. If the durable power of attorney hasn’t been officially
recorded at the county recorder’s office (the same place where the
reverse mortgage is recorded), the originator does that, too.
You can save a step and do that yourself by walking into your county
recorder’s office, plunking down a notarized durable power of attor-
ney, and saying, “I’d like this recorded please.” They’ll stamp it and
file a copy, which protects you in the event that your durable
power of attorney documents are somehow lost or destroyed.

Using a Living Trust 
as an Alternative
A durable power of attorney isn’t right for everyone. Some people
just aren’t cut out to manage other people’s lives; some can barely
manage their own. It’s a huge undertaking in many cases and it
takes a lot of dedication. Now, everyone loves their parents, even if
it’s way, way deep down. But if you’re feeling like durable power of
attorney is a bit to committal for you, you have other options (we
can talk about your commitment issues later).
You may have heard about wealthy spoiled kids who have a trust
fund waiting for them when they turn 18. Granted, it happens more
often in the movies than in real life, but trusts can be a useful tool
in managing another person’s finances. For our purposes, we’re
going to focus on the living trust (also called intervivos). A living
trust is the only kind that can be helpful to you in getting a reverse
mortgage for your parents, because it’s the only one that guaran-
tees the trust was created during your parents’ lifetime, hence the
name, “living trust.”
Generally speaking, a living trust allows one person (the trustee)
to handle the property title for another person (the beneficiary).
What’s confusing about the language of living trusts is that unlike
your parents’ will, which names beneficiaries who are usually the
heirs like you or your other family members, in this instance you
are the trustee and your parent is the beneficiary. It’s a financial
doppelganger. 
What’s not confusing is the basic benefit of a living trust: Your
parent can be both the trustee and the beneficiary (which means
they have control over everything on their own) until they become
incapacitated and then you or another named trustee can step in
and take over. There’s no worry about you having too much control
while your parent is still fully mentally functional. In this way it’s
similar to a springing power of attorney, but it has one big advan-
tage: Living trusts are a respected part of the financial world. While
people are often suspicious of a springing power of attorney, a
living trust almost never cause problems. They are widely accepted
as legal and reputable. 
A living trust may be set in stone (irrevocable) or able to be changed
or even canceled (revocable). The format you and your parents
choose depends on your individual situation, but it’s good to keep
in mind that things change. You may decide after a few years that a
durable power of attorney is the best path after all, or your parent
Chapter 14: Getting Durable Power of Attorney 225

may decide that your sister is really the one who should be in
charge of the house. Talk to a professional about the benefits and
potential pitfalls of both options. 
Getting a living trust set up is fairly simple, but it’s not the kind of
thing you can do yourself, just as it’s not a good idea to set up a
durable power of attorney on your own. There’s too much legal
mumbo jumbo and too many considerations, like what effects it
will have on your parent’s other financial areas. The property in a
living trust can sometimes (but not always) have an effect on your
parents’ taxes and government aide, like Medicare. You don’t want
to go to all the trouble of setting up a living trust and getting a
reverse mortgage just to find out that it has negative implications
for your parents’ taxes. The same elder law attorney you scouted
out for the durable power of attorney can be used to help create a
living trust (see “Finding an Elder Law Attorney,” earlier in this
chapter). This is actually one of those times when your regular
attorney can help you out, as long as he or she has some back-
ground in living trusts and other aspects of estate planning. 
Part of the reason a living trust is so easy to do is because you pay
someone else to do it, and you pay them a lot. There are legal fees,
processing fees, transfer fees, attorney-needs-a-vacation fees —
you get the idea. If you haven’t already, skip back to earlier in this
chapter to the “Finding a good elder law attorney” section and
start looking for a good attorney who won’t charge you an arm and
a leg. Again, your parent’s financial planning isn’t the time to skimp
on costs, but you may have some options as far as reduced-cost
elder law attorneys.
One of the downfalls of a living trust is that even when your parent
is incapacitated and you’re managing the trust, it only gives you
power over the property. In most cases, that’s as far as you can go
with it. You can get a reverse mortgage on the property, sell it, bull-
doze it, paint it purple, whatever you want. But you have no con-
trol over the rest of the assets unless they are expressly laid out
and transferred to you in the living trust. So if you are the trustee
but forgot to mention that you will eventually need control over
the rest of the estate (bank accounts, other property, family heir-
looms, and so on) you’re out of luck. That’s why it’s so important
to have a capable attorney helping you tie up any loose ends.

Chapter 15
Top Ten What Ifs When
Considering a Reverse
Mortgage
In This Chapter
 Dispelling some myths about reverse mortgages
 Answering your most common questions
W
hether you make this the first chapter you read or one of
the last, you likely have questions that aren’t unique to
your circumstances. Reverse mortgages beg a lot of questions, and
most people need only hear the basic rules to begin a barrage of
“what ifs.” Many what ifs are answered throughout the book, and
you can find the answers as you read. Others are included here,
with information that can also be found in the preceding chapters.
No question is too silly, too basic, or too embarrassing to ask your
counselor and originator. Trust us, they’ve heard it all. If you need
to know something, the best and simplest way to find out is to ask.
Speak up and let your confusions, reservations, and concerns be
heard. Every question you ask brings you closer to a full under-
standing of your own economic situation. 
What If I Want to Move?
This is probably the most often asked question among people con-
sidering a reverse mortgage. Consider this: You’ve signed off on
your reverse mortgage and are living happily and comfortably in
your home — then one day you start to realize that this is the time
in your life when you can finally move to Curaçao and open that
banana stand you always dreamed of. Or maybe it’s becoming
clear that you need a home with fewer stairs and more accessible

appliances. Perhaps it’s simply time to move on to an assisted-
living home where you can take it easy while someone else does
the cooking and cleaning for a change. Whatever your reason, you
have the right to choose to move out of your home. There are no
rules shackling you to your house and you are free to go as you
please.
There’s just one not-so-small catch. If you decide to move out per-
manently (or are gone for over a year), even if you don’t sell the
house, your loan becomes due to the lender. That’s payment in full,
which is a pretty big check to write. You have several options for
paying back a reverse mortgage, the most common of which is sell-
ing your home. You’re moving out anyway, so it’s a natural choice
that many people make. If you don’t wish to sell or your other family
members want to keep the house, you have to come up with alter-
native ways of paying back the loan. Check out Chapter 4 for lots 
of information about planning for repayment, and what to do when
the time comes. Your adult children may like to have a look at
Chapter 13 as well, which explains what their options are if you
should pass away before the loan is repaid.
What If Only One Homeowner 
Is Eligible?
Sometimes a couple (or any combination of people living together)
hear about reverse mortgages and want to jump right in. It’s under-
standable that you would want to get your hands on that money as
quickly as possible. Technically speaking, if at least one person in
the household is eligible for a reverse mortgage, that person can
go ahead with the loan no matter who else shares the same roof.
After all, why should you live without when you can have an
instant income flowing from your lender? Actually there’s a very
good reason not to: It leaves your roomie vulnerable.
In order to qualify for a reverse mortgage, you must be at least 62
and a homeowner with some equity. A couple aged 57 and 65 who
own their own home only half qualify — that younger resident has
to be removed from the title so the elder could get the loan, which
is not a smart move. If the older person decides to press on and
get a reverse mortgage anyway, he or she is be the only one who
holds the loan, even though the younger can continue to live in 
the house (reverse mortgages don’t pass judgment on living situa-
tions). So what’s the problem? If that older person dies or moves
out of the house and can’t be contacted, the younger almost
always is responsible for paying off the loan as an heir. That’s a big
Part V: The Part of Tens 
230

debt to pay — the younger homeowner would probably have to
sell the house to pay off the loan, which isn’t always a welcome
change.
What’s more, there’s a benefit to waiting for both members of the
household to be eligible: The longer you wait, the older you get
(wait, the good part is coming); the older you get, the more money
lenders lend to you. A difference of five years can mean several
thousand dollars! If you’re in a situation where only one home-
owner qualifies and you absolutely can’t wait, try to find another
solution to your money troubles. You can find some options in
Chapter 8.
This is a good place to mention that if you are both eligible, but one
has durable power of attorney over the other (this happens often
when one spouse is mentally incapacitated and the other cares for
him or her), you can both be on the loan, as long as the one with
durable power of attorney signs the documents as “attorney in
fact” or some variation. Chapter 14 talks about durable power of
attorney, and although it focuses on adult children as durable
power of attorney, you may benefit from reading up on it, too.
What If I Need More Money?
You have a reverse mortgage, you’re balancing your checkbook,
and you’ve realized that you need more cash if you’re going to
make it. You have a couple of major options:
 You can do a refinance if the lender’s loan limits increase
during your loan. For example, in 2004 the Home Equity
Conversion Mortgage (HECM) limits were $160,176 to $290,319
depending on the county. But in 2005 they increased to
$172,632 to $312,896. That’s about a $12,000 difference, which
can make a big difference in your available funds. To take
advantage of a refinance, talk to your originator and ask to be
notified when lending limits increase.
 If you’re receiving monthly payments and you’re facing a large
expense that you can’t pay with your savings, you can change
your payment to a larger monthly payment, line of credit,
lump sum, or a combination of monthly checks and another
chunk of cash. For example, if you’re receiving $600 per
month and suddenly need $7,500 worth of repairs done to
your car, you can take out that entire amount in a lump sum,
which simply gets added to your loan balance and is
deducted from the total amount available. This can be done
by contacting the loan servicer and requesting that your loan
Chapter 15: Top Ten What Ifs 231

be “modified.” The servicer makes the calculations on your
loan to determine the amount you are receiving monthly,
which is then reduced in order to provide you the lump sum
you need. This modification costs a grand total of $20, which
will appear on the next statement you receive from your loan
servicer.
However, if you originally received a lump sum or a line of credit
and you spent it all, well, you’re out of luck. That’s why it’s crucial
to understand your monthly budget and plan accordingly. Chap-
ter 2 gives you more information about budgeting and estimating
expenses.
What If I Still Owe Money 
on My Previous Loan?
Because reverse mortgages are based on the equity you’ve
acquired in your home, the more equity you have the higher the
loan you can get. It’s an abstract concept, but the money you’re
borrowing is actually already yours: It’s a portion of the money you
would get if you were to sell your house.
You don’t necessarily have to own your home outright in order to
qualify for a reverse mortgage, but you do have to be reasonably
close. The reason is: Whatever you owe on your home needs to be
paid off by your reverse mortgage. Whatever’s left is yours to play
with. If you owe $5,000 on your home and the lenders have agreed
to let you borrow $100,000, that prior debt brings you down to
$95,000. Generally, if you owe more than 25 percent on your home,
you won’t get the full benefits of the reverse mortgage and may
want to consider another route if you can.
What If I Sell My House for 
More than the Loan Amount?
If you have a $75,000 loan and you sell your house for $389,000,
you end up with $314,000 left over! Who gets it? Why, you do of
course. It’s your house, your money, your cash bonanza. If the loan
has become due upon your death, your family (or whoever you’ve
named in your will) is entitled to the left over equity.
A lot of fear surrounds reverse mortgages that no matter what you
borrow or how much your home is worth, the lender is going to
Part V: The Part of Tens 
232

swoop in like a cartoon evildoer and take your home away when
the loan is due. Many people fear that if they sell their home for a
great price, they may lose it all by handing it over to the lenders.
It’s simply not true.
What If I Sell the House for 
Less than the Loan Amount?
You win. Well, you don’t win, but it’s a draw. 
Lenders know that life is precarious and that nothing is certain,
especially in real estate. That’s why you pay a mortgage insurance
premium (MIP) with an HECM loan, you get a lower loan limit with
Fannie Mae, and you pay higher interest with the Financial Freedom
loan — it’s all protection for just such an occasion. If you owe
$300,000 in loan and fees, but you can only sell your house for
$210,000, all you need to do is sell your house for the best price
you can, and your lender has to accept it as your loan repayment.
Never mind that in this case, you’re about $100,000 shy of the
actual total. The golden rule of reverse mortgages is: You can
never owe more than your home sells for.
This is actually the reason some people are afraid of reverse 
mortgages — the idea that you only have to pay back what your
home sells for has been convoluted into a misconception that
whatever your house sells for is what you pay back, large or small.
But, as we discuss in the preceding section, “What If I Sell My
House for More than the Loan Amount?”, if your house actually
sells for more than your loan amount, you get to pocket the equity.
Now you know the facts and can set your friends straight about
repayment. For more on this topic, go back to Chapter 7.
What If I Want to Get 
out of the Loan?
You have a few choices if you simply don’t like the structure of the
loan and no adjustments can make you happier. Because a reverse
mortgage usually comes to an end by the borrower moving out,
dying, or not maintaining the house, you only have a few options.
Faking your own death is too extreme (and illegal) so we’ll skip
that idea; moving out may not be an option if you love your home
but aren’t so fond of the loan; And we certainly want you to keep
paying your homeowner’s insurance and not live in a house that
Chapter 15: Top Ten What Ifs 233

becomes more dilapidated each year, so not maintaining your
home is also out of the question. So what else can you do?
If you’ve changed your mind within the first three business days
after signing the documents, you simply call up your originator
and say, “I’ve changed my mind.” This is called a rescission, and it
shouldn’t be taken lightly — everyone gets cold feet after a big
financial decision. Chapter 11 has some checklists for exercising
your right of rescission; read over it carefully before you change
your mind for good.
You can also end the loan by paying it off. In most cases, it doesn’t
take you too long to figure out that this isn’t the loan for you. You
can liken it to those people who go to a restaurant, eat all but two
bites of their meal and then call the waiter over to say “I didn’t like
it at all.” Because most people who change their minds have had
their loan for a relatively short period of time, it shouldn’t be too
hard to pay it back. On the other hand, if you got a lump sum,
spent it all in your first four months, and then decided you aren’t
crazy about reverse mortgages, you may have a harder time paying
it all back.
What If I Marry Someone Who 
also Has a Reverse Mortgage?
Don’t laugh. Romance among seniors is more common than most
people think. What with today’s divorce rates, people staying
single longer, and everything from cell phones to nonstick pans
causing cancer, it’s no wonder there are a lot of sexy single seniors.
If two seniors with reverse mortgages want to marry (or live
together) they have two main choices:
 One spouse can give up his or her reverse mortgage by paying
it off (if one of you is selling your home to move in with the
other this makes perfect sense). The only hazard here is that
the other’s reverse mortgage becomes due when he or she
dies, regardless of who’s still occupying the house. 
 You can each pay off your loan (an especially good idea if
you’re buying a new home together and both selling your
homes, making it possible to put a lot of money down on the
new home) and enter into a new reverse mortgage together.
What you can’t do is add one onto the other’s loan. Since each
reverse mortgage is tailor-made to a specific person, it isn’t possi-
ble to throw another resident into the mix and keep the loan as-is.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
234

What If a Couple Has a Reverse
Mortgage and Gets Divorced?
The short answer is: You each move into a groovy pad and use the
money from the sale of the home to pay off the loan in an amiable
fashion.
The long answer is a little more complicated. If one person wants
to stay in the home and the other (understandably) needs to move
out, the loan stays in effect because the rule is that the reverse
mortgage is due when the last borrower dies or moves out. Where
it gets tricky is actually not our jurisdiction, but it’s something to
think about. The money from the reverse mortgage may or may not
be eligible for alimony, and it can get pretty ugly between “he
already used up $10,000 on golf clubs” and “she spent just as much
on new furniture.” The bottom line is this: If your marriage is on
the rocks, don’t enter into a loan together. You’re just asking for
trouble. If you need something to bring you together, try an orchid.
Or therapy.
What If the Surviving Resident Is
a Domestic Partner, Not a Spouse?
As long as the domestic partner is listed as a borrower (which by
default means he or she must be listed on the title), the loan goes
on unscathed. Nowhere in the reverse mortgage rules does it say
that people with a reverse mortgage have to be married. Just make
sure that two very important things are in place:
 The loan is signed by both residents, naming both as borrow-
ers, and both are listed on the home’s title.
 Both partners’ wills clearly state that the home is to be left to
the other. This shouldn’t even be a factor since the reverse
mortgage continues if the above condition is met, but it’s better
to be safe than pressured out of the home by your partner’s
pushy niece.

Ten Resources for Securing 
a Reverse Mortgage
In This Chapter
 Discovering the best Web sites
 Finding the best booklets
 Checking out the best guidance out there
W
e all need a little extra support here and there. Embarking
on a big financial decision can be a little unsettling, or 
even scary, and we want you to have as many people at your beck
and call as possible. Whether you’re a senior who’s looking for a
reverse mortgage for yourself, or a pre-senior who’s researching
the idea for your parents (or even for your future), there are count-
less organizations and individuals out there who can set your
reverse mortgage wheels in motion.
We think we’ve given you a pretty darn good resource for reverse
mortgages here, but there are additional organizations out there
that also have great information. Sometimes you need to speak to a
live person, other times it just feels good to see what you’ve read
somewhere else as well. Whatever you need to guide you to make
the right decision about your reverse mortgage, these resources
(in alphabetical order) can help you make your dreams a reality.
AARP’s Home Made Money
Available as a download online (you print it out yourself) or in a
hard copy (a book sent to your home), this free 51-page booklet
offers a general overview of reverse mortgages. The book is heavy
on the HECM loan (see Chapter 5), but it also includes a section on
the Fannie Mae Home Keeper (see Chapter 6), although it doesn’t
say much on private loans like the one offered from Financial
Freedom (see Chapter 7). The good thing about “Home Made Money”

is that it is completely unbiased, as is the AARP’s way. That means
you never have to worry that they’re trying to sell you something
or talk you into a loan that may not be right for you.
One particularly helpful aspect is the appendix, which explains
rising debt and falling equity. This concept is often difficult to visu-
alize, especially if you’ve spent 80 percent of your life earning equity
in the home you own. Charts and simple language make this addi-
tion an especially nice tool for assisting a parent who seems a little
confused. You can order the booklet by calling AARP at 800-424-3410
or visit the Web site at www.aarp.org/revmort.
AARP’s Web Site
Take this book over to your computer right now and go to www.
aarp.org. You can find reverse mortgage information at this site,
of course, but you can also discover link after link of smart tips,
discounted professionals like lawyers and financial planners, arti-
cles full of ideas for a healthy senior lifestyle, additional resources,
and so much more. You don’t have to be an AARP member to use
the site, but you do have to be a member to take advantage of
some of the benefits. You’d be amazed at what kind of services you
can get as an AARP card-carrying member.
While you’re on the site, be sure to read the plentiful articles on
reverse mortgages. You can read about current reverse mortgage
trends (who’s getting them, where they’re most popular, and so
on), as well as any changes that may have occurred in loan limits
or interest rates since you purchased this book. You can also link
to the AARP Network counselor site and print out an application
for counseling.
Administration on Aging
The Administration on Aging is a government-organized agency
that offers one of the most comprehensive collections of informa-
tion and education for seniors out there. You can find resources for
every topic under the sun, from living arrangements to medical
issues to mental health. The site also provides special sections for
adult children and other caregivers, too, so encourage your family
to take a spin on its Web site, www.aoa.dhhs.gov. If you’re not
Web savvy and you can’t wait for your grandniece to show you
how it’s done, call them at 800-677-1116 to request information
packets or get advice on where to turn. When you call, be sure to
tell them what state you live in so they can direct you to organiza-
tions in your area.

BenefitsCheckup.org
Don’t walk away from your computer quite yet. Before you even visit
your reverse mortgage counselor, go to www.benefitscheckup.
org, sponsored by the National Council on the Aging. This confi-
dential Web site works like any other questionnaire: They ask a
series of straightforward questions and you click on “yes” or “no”
(or sometimes choose from a pull-down menu). Many questions
have a little “help” button next to them, which further explain what
they’re looking for. It takes about ten minutes to complete, which is
well worth it if it can find programs in your area that may let you
stay in your home without having to pay thousands of dollars in
loan fees and interest. Even if you’re well off and don’t mind the
loan expenses, give it a whirl. It’s fun to fill out forms!
When you get the results, print them out and take them with you to
the reverse mortgage counselor. Your counselor can discuss your
options with you more efficiently if you already have an idea of
what they are. If you are an adult child or other non-senior, you can
fill out the questionnaire for your favorite elder, but the ideal solu-
tion is to do it together and fill out the questionnaire as honestly
and completely as you can. The resulting potential savings are well
worth the time.
Counselor
The reverse mortgage counselor is your first contact in the reverse
mortgage process. You can read all about counselors in Chapter 8,
but in the meantime remember that the reverse mortgage coun-
selor’s job is to guide you through sorting out all of your options
and to let you make your own decision. The counselors won’t tell
you what to do, but they will tell you what kind of impact each
choice can have on your finances, your home, and your family in
an unbiased way. Take their information to heart — these people
know their stuff. 
Use the time with your counselor to ask, tell, ask, tell:
 Ask what options are available to you.
 Tell them what your financial goals are.
 Ask for a comparison of options that fit your circumstances.

No question is a stupid question. The counselors want to make
sure you understand what you’re getting yourself into if you decide
to go with a reverse mortgage. Counselor sessions are confidential,
relatively painless (usually only an hour or so long), and free.
There are counselors who charge a fee ($75 is an average amount)
but you can usually find another who may agree to meet with you
“on the house” . . . sorry, we couldn’t resist.
Fannie Mae
As one of the nation’s largest home loan lenders, Fannie Mae
knows mortgages, and they continue to be a leader in all types of
home loans. Fannie Mae’s version of the reverse mortgage, the
Home Keeper or Home Keeper for Purchase (see Chapter 6), are
two options that may just solve your money woes or give you that
little bit of extra cash that allows you some breathing room.
Fannie Mae has developed several pamphlets that can get comfort-
able with taking out a new loan, and even a booklet called “Money
from Home” that covers the basics of reverse mortgages. In addi-
tion, its Web site has lots of information you can use to get a
reverse mortgage, such as preferred lenders (originators) and its
own network of counselors. Fannie Mae’s site also offers fact
sheets, which spell out the basics of their loans, as well as the HUD
Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (see Chapter 5). It’s a good
quick reference to use as a page marker in this book. Go to www.
fanniemae.com and click on “find a mortgage” (on the left toward
the bottom of the page) and then “reverse mortgages.” Or call
Fannie Mae at 800-732-6643 and ask for all of its literature on
reverse mortgages.
Financial Freedom
Offering the newest of all the reverse mortgage options, Financial
Freedom’s Jumbo Cash Account plays with the big boys (see
Chapter 7). Financial Freedom recognized a need for loans that
covered homes worth more than the national average (which is
what HUD and Fannie Mae base its loans on) and created a reverse
mortgage that benefits homeowners with home values around a
million dollars or more. Its Web site is chock full of interesting 
links — but our favorite Financial Freedom benefit is the reverse
mortgage newsletters it offers free of charge. Sign up for it on the
site (www.reverse.com) or call 800-500-5150.

Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD)
If you could take everything any homeowner ever needed to know
and put it all in one place, you’d find yourself at the Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) Web site. HUD has tons of information
for seniors and a special section for reverse mortgages. The site,
www.hud.gov/buying/rvrsmort.cfm, has links to specific
reverse mortgage topics, like finding a HUD-approved counselor
(always a safe bet) and HUD-approved lenders/originators (like-
wise). You can also report crooked reverse mortgage dealings by
contacting its hotline at 800-358-6216.
National Reverse Mortgage
Lenders Association (NRMLA)
The NRMLA is just what it sounds like: a club for reverse mortgage
lenders, also known as originators. The NRMLA has some basic
free information called “Just the FAQs,” among others. You can call
to order all of its reading material at 866-264-4466, or just download
it online at www.reversemortgage.org. You can also search for an
NRMLA member in your state. Also, click on “Borrower Profiles” to
read about other seniors who received reverse mortgages and all
the zany things they did with their money. Okay, some are zany
and some are pretty sensible, but they could give you some great
ideas about how to use your money if you’re on the fence.
The NRMLA site has a great reverse mortgage calculator, too. On
the NRMLA home page, click on the calculator and get an estimate
of what you can borrow based on your age, home value, neighbor-
hood, outstanding debts, and what (if any) credit line you want.
Just click on “Calculate” to see a breakdown of what you could get
with three different loan options (two HECM and Home Keeper).
What’s really neat is that the calculator remembers you on your
computer, so the next time you visit the site, you won’t have to re-
enter all of your information. But that’s not all. When you click on
“Loan Summary” you can see exactly how it figured out your esti-
mated loan amount. This is an incredibly useful tool to help you
decide which loan you may want to pursue, and something you may
want to print out and take with you when you see your counselor.
Chapter 16: Ten Resources for Securing a Reverse Mortgage 241

Originator
At last we come to someone who doesn’t offer you free services:
the originator. You pay this person a lot to manage this transac-
tion. The fees depend on the loan and the value of your home (see
Chapters 5, 6, and 7), but you can assume you have to pay, at the
very least, $2,000. What do you get for your money? You get one 
of the best reverse mortgage resources out there. A good reverse
mortgage originator can answer every question you have with
authority, patience, and a smile.
Use your originator to the fullest. Bring a notepad full of questions,
and get ready to take some notes. As long as you’re bringing things,
have your adult children, financial advisor, and/or other friend tag
along, too. Your originator should encourage you to have your
family around.

Ten Common Mistakes
Borrowers Make 
In This Chapter
 Finding out what you shouldn’t do when getting a reverse mortgage
 Getting tips on avoiding common mistakes
 Making smart choices
T
here’s a wonderful thing about other people’s mistakes: You
get all of the lesson and none of the misfortune. Being a smart
reverse mortgage borrower is important, since you’re making a
rather large fiscal commitment that can impact your entire life, and
possibly that of your family. Reverse mortgages are designed to be
a safe choice for seniors, but there are some things that can make
them a better experience. Be proactive in your choices, and be
sure to listen to the advice and wisdom of your counselor and orig-
inator. Below you can find ten of the most common mistakes that
borrowers make when getting a reverse mortgage. Once you read
them you should have no excuse not to avoid them.
Borrowing to Pay Off Small Debts
Sometimes you need a little extra cash to get what you need. It
could be a real need, like medical bills, or a want, like a new car or
overextended credit cards. Whether you owe money for wants or
needs, this is not — repeat, not — the time to get a reverse mort-
gage. Let’s say you have a $7,000 debt to your credit card company
after a no-holds-barred holiday in the Riviera. If you take just the
interest, closing costs, originator fees, and all those little inciden-
tals and add them all up for a moderate-size loan, you could be
looking at tens of thousands of dollars, and that’s before you’ve
even paid off the principal (the actual loan amount). Now you’ve
spent two or three times as much money (or more) on the price of

your loan than you would have if you’d just paid off the original
debt. Does that sound like a smart financial decision? No way.
For smaller debts like these, you have some options. Start by talk-
ing to your bank about a small loan and see what they have to
offer. They may have a low-interest loan with no additional fees.
You can also try asking your family members for a loan; if you can
get a little here and a little there, you may be able to meet your
needs. The only time a reverse mortgage is appropriate for a
smaller loan is if it’s absolutely, positively, completely your last
resort, and you’re desperate, and you’re willing to pay big fees for
a small loan. Talk to your counselor about your options. You may
find that there are government programs that can assist you if your
debt is something like overdue property taxes or other programs.
It’s worth your hour-long appointment to find ways to avoid paying
big bucks if you don’t have to.
Draining the Loan
Reverse mortgages aren’t an exact science. Your loan amount is
based largely on an educated guess that no one has an ounce of
control over: how long you’ll stay in your home. Sure, lenders can
look at the statistics and figure out what age you may be when the
loan ends, but none of it is concrete. If you’re 83 years old and get-
ting a reverse mortgage, they may assume you’ll have the loan for
seven years and set your loan amount accordingly. If they agree to
lend you $120,000 on a line of credit, that’s just over $17,000 per
year ($120,000 divided by 7 years) — a nice healthy income.
However, two things can happen that will put a big damper on that
little nest egg:
 You may drain your money too fast, using it all up in the first
few years.
 You may live in your home longer than you expected and run
out of cash.
To avoid running out of money (whether sooner or later), budget
carefully and don’t carry large sums of money with you — we all
know how much easier it is to spend money in your wallet than
money in the bank. Unless you have a tenured monthly payment
(fixed monthly payments as long as you live in the home), you
need to keep an eye on your spending and make sure you’re not
going to be left without the money you need. If you need help, ask
a loved one to give you a hand in managing your money.

Failing to Establish a Living Trust
An intervivos, or living, trust isn’t a necessity for getting a reverse
mortgage, but it can save a lot of headaches down the road if you
and your children have one in place. Living trusts can be con-
structed so that seniors have complete control over their own
affairs, including their reverse mortgage, until the day they can’t
manage real estate and financial responsibilities on their own. In
Chapter 14 we talk about a living trust as an alternative to adult
children getting durable power of attorney. However, anyone can
benefit from having a living trust, and reverse mortgage borrowers
may find that they feel more secure in getting a loan knowing that
someone who loves them is there to take over if they should
become mentally incapacitated. 
The process of getting a living trust is fairly simple since you hire
an elder law attorney to do it for you (see Chapter 14 for more on
an elder law attorney) — anything is easy when you pay someone
else to do it! You can set the terms in whatever way you’re com-
fortable. A living trust means you’re involved in the proceedings,
so you have a say in who gets the honor of managing your real
estate if you’ve gone ’round the bend. By failing to establish a
living trust, you’re leaving yourself (and your family) open to a
whole host of potentially big problems.
Getting the Loan Too Early
Three things that get better with age are wine, reverse mortgages,
and you!
The day you’re eligible for a reverse mortgage is the day they light
62 candles on your cake. At 62, most people aren’t ready to be
called seniors; these days, 62 is the new 40. You’re ready to start
living life and loving it, whether you’re retired, working, traveling,
painting, riding your motorcycle, or whatever your passion is.
Sounds like a great time to cash in on your home equity and get a
reverse mortgage right? You’d think so, but unless you can’t wait
another day for that income, you may be better off waiting a few
years.
Generally, your potential reverse mortgage loan principal goes up
in value as you do. Although interest rates may rise in the next few
years (which affects the value of the loan) the older you are, the
more you can normally expect to get from a reverse mortgage.
Generally speaking, you should gain about $10,000 in loan value for
Chapter 17: Ten Common Mistakes Borrowers Make 245

every five years that you wait to sign those documents. To decide
whether you can afford to wait, ask yourself these four questions:
 Do I have enough money in savings to continue living comfort-
able for at least five years?
 Can I work for at least five more years to earn and save some
money in the meantime?
 Am I anticipating a large expense that I’ll need extra funds to
cover (such as a surgery, new car, remodel, and so on)?
 Can I live safely in this home for at least five more years?
If you still think you need a reverse mortgage right away, go and
talk to a reverse mortgage counselor about your options. Once you
see how low your loan amount will be, you may be singing a differ-
ent tune.
Getting the Loan Too Late
Waiting a few years to increase to total loan principal is one thing.
Waiting so long you don’t have time to enjoy it is quite another.
The idea behind reverse mortgages is to allow you to live out your
senior years in comfort, not to make you deprive yourself of com-
fort until you’re 93, just to enjoy a bigger loan for a couple of years.
You have to be able to imagine the advantages of a slightly smaller
loan with more time to live it up. 
Consider this: You’re 70 years old, still relatively mobile and adven-
turous. You want to see the Great Wall of China before it’s too late,
so you and your son hop on a plane and your dream comes true,
courtesy of your reverse mortgage funds. That’s a memory you can
always cherish. Now pretend you’re 93, have never fulfilled your
biggest wishes, and discover that although you have plenty of cash
to throw around, your doctor doesn’t want you to go more than
five miles from your front door. Unless you’re only finding out about
reverse mortgages at 93, there’s no reason to wait that long before
you sign off on your loan. Use your best judgment, and get the loan
when you believe you can appreciate the extra money the most.
Making Poor Investments
Many people believe that the smartest thing to do with the whole
of their reverse mortgage funds is to invest it. This could be in
stocks and bonds, in an off-Broadway production starring you, in
your friend’s small business selling everything for the bratwurst
Part V: The Part of Tens 
246

enthusiast, or any of thousands of other capital ventures. After all,
historically most investments return at a rate of 8 percent! That
could be a whole lotta moolah. But (this is the part where investing
stops looking like such a grand idea) time is not on your side. Stocks
may return at 8 percent, but that’s over 50 years of highs and very,
very lows. If you get caught at a low point, you’ll be left with no
money and no equity to bank on. Risky ideas are not the best option
for your money if it’s your only source of income and/or savings.
The trouble is, it’s not always easy to tell what’s a risky investment
and what’s a solid cash cultivator. Before you sink your money into
anything, get some feedback. Go to your family, your financial plan-
ner, and talk to your reverse mortgage counselor about your ideas.
Bounce the investment plan off people you trust and see what they
think.
Another not-so-risky but not-so-smart-either idea is setting your
money aside in a CD (certificate of deposit) at your bank. If you
have an HECM loan with a line of credit (see Chapter 5), chances
are good that you’re earning more on the unused money in your
loan, which you can access freely, than you are in a CD that locks
up your money for a certain period of time. Again, contact a finan-
cial planner (or at least a family accountant) and let them show
you how your investment ideas compare.
Neglecting the Home
You may recall that there are three ways for a loan to become due
in full: You move out, die, or fail to maintain your property. If you
neglect your home and let it go to “seed,” the lender can end the
loan and demand repayment. Of course, it’s rare that the lender
will come by and inspect your home, but there are a couple of red
flags that go up if you’re exhibiting certain behavior:
 You stop paying your property taxes. You’re required to con-
tinue all of your regular city or state property taxes while
receiving your reverse mortgage funds. An easy way to make
sure this happens (forgetfulness is a common trait among
reverse mortgage borrowers) is to let the lenders take care of
this for you. You have the option to have your property taxes
taken straight out of your loan and paid by the lender; use this
feature if you think paying property taxes may slip your mind.
 You stop paying your homeowner’s insurance. It’s crucial
that you keep up with your regular insurance payments. Not
only does this protect you if anything should happen to your
home or your possessions, but it also protects the lender’s
Chapter 17: Ten Common Mistakes Borrowers Make 247

investment (so you can see why they’d be sticklers about
this). Along with your property tax, you can elect to let the
lender take over your homeowner’s insurance payments. 
It’s a good way to make sure you never fall behind.
 You never follow up on your repair rider. When your home
is appraised, the appraiser may find that some areas of your
house need to be addressed before they can recommend you
as a good candidate for a reverse mortgage. It may be some-
thing relatively small like a malfunctioning water heater, or a
big project like replacing the roof over your kitchen. That
appraisal report goes off to the lender, who notes in a repair
rider that in order to receive your loan, you need to fix this
problem. If you choose to use some of your reverse mortgage
money for that purpose, you have up to one year to have it
completed by a licensed contractor. Your lender even sets
aside an estimated amount for you to dip into. If you don’t get
the problem fixed to the appraiser’s satisfaction, you may be
looking at a loan that’s due right away. Remember, always
complete those repair riders before you spend your money on
anything else.
Short-Lived Loans
You never owe anything on your loan (including fees and interest)
until the loan has ended due to your actions. Everything you’re
about to read is illustrative for conceptual purposes.
The beauty of a reverse mortgage is that the longer you have it, the
better of a value it is. Take this example: You get a $167,000 loan
paid out monthly (over an estimated eight years), and pay $7,000
in fees and interest. If you keep the loan for only one year, you’re
paying an awful lot for the privilege of having a loan — about 33
percent of your total income (around $20,000) so far. If you move
right away (or die) you’ll have spent quite a lot of money for a
comparatively minor loan. Would you do business with someone
who wanted you to give them 33 percent in fees and interest? It
just wouldn’t make good money sense.
Now imagine you keep the loan for three years. You’ll have spent
about $11,000 in fees and interest, but you’ll have received so
much more from your monthly payments. At this point, you’re only
spending about 17 percent of your cash on the loan costs. That’s
quite a difference! Fast forward to year six of the loan: You’ll have
spent a total of about $15,500 on fees and interest, but now that
number is only 12 percent of the total you’ve received. By the
eighth year, your total loan costs are only about 10 percent of your
Part V: The Part of Tens 
248

total earnings — and that paints a much better financial picture! If
you outlive the estimated life of the loan, you’ll pay even less per
year because you’re getting money much faster than the lender
can charge you. If you only need a short-term loan, consider a bank
loan or other means of cash flow instead. Selling your home may
be a good option if you plan to move soon anyway.
Taking Out More than You Need
This mistake applies mostly to people with HECM lines of credit 
(a very common choice discussed in more detail in Chapter 5).
Just to refresh, the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage offers a line
of credit as a payment option, which works like a savings account
based on the equity in your home: Whatever you don’t use earns
an additional percentage of usable funds at pretty great rates. You
have access to the money just like you would from a bank, and you
can withdraw it in any amount you like.
The mistake comes when you take excess money out of the line of
credit (more than you need) and let it sit somewhere else, such as
a regular bank account, under your mattress, in your wallet, or in
any other investment. Unless you know of some sure-fire risk-free
investment source (if you do, please share your secret with us),
none of these can work as hard for you as the accrued money you
earn on a line of credit. Taking too much money out is like throwing
away a few hundred dollars per month in interest.
Using a “Forward” Originator
Would you call a podiatrist for a toothache? Would you hire a
street sweeper to clean your carpets? Just because two people
have the same basic training doesn’t mean either can take each
other’s place as experts. The same is true for forward (traditional)
originators and reverse mortgage specialists. While forward origi-
nators are certainly capable of doing regular loans for people,
many have barely heard of reverse mortgages, and most don’t
know the first thing about all the little nuances of the different
reverse mortgage products.
If you have an originator who has helped you out in the past, they
may be able to refer you to a reverse mortgage originator. You need
an originator with experience, and the only way to ensure a quality
loan is by using a reverse mortgage originator. Find yours by search-
ing the AARP, National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, or
HUD lists (see Chapter 9 for more on these resources).

Appendix
Glossary
T
he following glossary of reverse mortgage terms can have you
speaking like the pros. We’ve included some words that are not
found in this book (we thought they were too technical or infre-
quently used) but which may come up during your own loan pro-
ceedings. Don’t be afraid to take this with you when you go to your
counselor or originator so you can keep up with any unfamiliar
terms. At the end of this section, write in any words and their defi-
nitions that come up during the loan process and aren’t covered
here (which may be terms that are used only in very specific situa-
tions, or don’t relate directly to reverse mortgages). That way you
can have all of your important terms in one convenient place.
203-b limit: From Section 203-b of the National Housing Act, this
code refers to the dollar limit that is used to determine how much
you can get from an HECM loan in your county. This is based on
the value of your home versus the average home price in your area
in relation to the rest of the country. The lowest limits are for
mostly rural counties and, in 2005, topped out at $172,632. Higher
home value areas (usually urban areas and larger counties) are set
at $312,896. These limits change every year or so to reflect current
housing prices.
Acceleration clause: Usually there are only two ways to end your
reverse mortgage — by moving out or dying. An acceleration
clause says that a loan may be declared due and payable if you fail
to maintain your home safely, pay your property taxes, or are
remiss on your homeowner’s insurance. It accelerates your loan
pay date. All major reverse mortgages include this clause to pro-
tect the lender and you.
Adjustable rate mortgage (ARM): An adjustable rate is just as it
sounds; the interest rate on your loan changes (adjusts) unlike a
traditional 30-year fixed-rate loan that you may have had in the
past. ARMs can adjust every month, every year, or every six
months, depending on your loan. ARMs are based on federal inter-
est rates, plus an additional amount added by the lender.

Appraisal: The estimate of the value of your home in a fair market.
The appraised value is, in theory, what you could sell your home
for if you were to put it up for sale today. The estimate is done by
an appraiser, who comes to your home, inspects it, and compares
it with three comparable properties.
Appreciation: The dollar amount increase in your home’s value.
Appreciation can work to your advantage in a reverse mortgage —
if your home appreciates beyond the total loan amount due, you or
your heirs will receive the difference if/when you sell your home.
Area Agency on Aging: A great resource for seniors and their fami-
lies, this nonprofit organization operates locally and nationally.
Find it online at www.aoa.dhhs.gov or call 800-677-1116.
Attorney in fact: Also called an agent, this is the person who holds
durable power of attorney over another. In a reverse mortgage, this
is usually an adult child who helps their parent secure a loan.
Cap: The limit that your ARM can go up or down during your loan.
It varies for each loan. For instance, on a Home Keeper, your inter-
est rate will never be more than 12 percent above your original rate.
Closing: The end of the application process, in which you sign the
final papers, the originator records the loan with your county, and
the loan officially begins. 
Closing costs: The total of all fees and other charges, traditionally
paid in full at closing. Since this can be quite expensive, this dollar
amount can also be financed into your loan balance.
Co-borrower: Any other person who signs the same loan with you.
The loan is due when the last remaining co-borrower moves out or
dies or when the house is no longer maintained.
Comparables: Term used by appraisers to describe similar houses
in your neighborhood that they use to help determine the value of
your home. Also called comps.
Counselor: A requirement for any reverse mortgage, counselors
lay out your options for you, give you a basis of education, and
assess your candidacy for a reverse mortgage.
Deed of trust: The deed of trust is the one that is recorded with
the county to secure your loan. This is the only one that affects a
reverse mortgage and the only one you need to think about.
Deferred payment loans (DPLs): A DPL is a type of reverse mort-
gage, usually state sponsored, that gives you a loan specifically to
Reverse Mortgages For Dummies 
252

repair or improve your home. You are limited to this use of the
money, and the loan is generally much smaller than one of the
three major reverse mortgage products.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD):
Government division that oversees the nation’s housing concerns.
Offers the HECM loan.
Depreciation: This is a loss of your home’s value, which can actu-
ally work to your advantage in a reverse mortgage. If you borrow
$100,000 and by the time you sell your home, your home is only
worth $90,000, you are only liable to repay that $90,000. The left-
over $10,000 is absorbed by the lender.
Durable power of attorney: Written permission for someone else
to act on your behalf, usually an adult child. Someone with power
of attorney can legally take out a reverse mortgage for the senior
who has been entrusted to them.
Equity: The value of your home if you were to sell it, minus any
debts you owe on it. For example, if you own a home worth
$250,000 but still owe $75,000 on it, your home equity would be
$175,000. Your reverse mortgage loan value is based partially on
your equity.
Fannie Mae: A government-sponsored company that operates pri-
vately to buy and sell mortgages. They are the primary source of
reverse mortgage funds and offer their own loan, the Home Keeper
or Home Keeper for Purchase.
Federal Housing Administration (FHA): You can think of the FHA
as the watchdogs of reverse mortgages. They are a branch of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which
offers the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM).
Financial Freedom: One of the largest private lenders, Financial
Freedom offers the Jumbo Cash Account for higher-value homes.
Financing: Rolling the costs of getting your loan (originator fees,
closing costs, and so on) into the total loan balance in order to pay
these extra costs along with your loan repayment. Many people
opt to finance their fees, which can be several thousand dollars.
Fixed rate mortgage: Most likely what you have currently, a fixed-
rate loan is usually a 30-year term with an interest rate that stays
the same for the entire life of the loan. These are falling by the way-
side in recent years, in favor of ARMs. Long-term fixed rate loans
are not an option in reverse mortgages. 
Appendix: Glossary 253

Grant deed: A document that gives ownership to a property. This
transfers property from one person or party to another.
Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM): By far the most pop-
ular reverse mortgage, the HECM is offered by HUD and is insured
through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).
Home Keeper: Fannie Mae’s reverse mortgage product, which
offers higher loan limits than HECM and no mortgage insurance
payment, but often lower loan principals.
Home Keeper for Purchase: A spin-off of the Home Keeper, this loan
is designed to use the reverse mortgage to help buy a new home.
Index: The base interest rate, which varies depending on your loan
type. This number, plus a margin, equals your reverse mortgage
interest rate.
Jumbo Cash Account: Financial Freedom’s reverse mortgage, the
Jumbo Cash Account is intended for seniors with home values
above the current Fannie Mae limits, but is best suited for those
owning homes worth $700,000 or more. The loan is a credit line
only — monthly payments are not an option.
Leftover equity: In a reverse mortgage, leftover equity refers to the
money left over from the sale of the home after your lender has
been repaid.
Lender: The company that actually funds the loan. Lenders dis-
cussed in this book include Fannie Mae and Financial Freedom,
although others do exist.
Line of credit: Also called a credit line, this loan payment option
allows you choose how much money you want to withdraw from
your loan “account” and how often. There is a minimum draw
amount of $500, which is meant to prevent someone requesting
$29.75 to pay a utility bill.
Living trust: Allows someone (usually an adult child) to handle a
property matters for you.
Loan balance: This dollar amount equals the amount you owe 
on your loan, including interest and any fees that were financed
with your loan.
London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) index: The rate at which
banks lend money to each other in London, England, used by
Financial Freedom to calculate your reverse mortgage interest rate.
Reverse Mortgages For Dummies 
254

Lump sum: One of three main payment options — you receive a
check for the total loan amount at closing and manage it as you wish,
but will receive no additional money from your reverse mortgage.
Margin: The extra percentage points an originator or lender can
add to the base interest rate (set by the government). Margins are
capped differently for each loan, but are generally between 1.5 and
5 percent. 
Mortgage insurance: Associated with HECM loans, protects you
and the lender in case your loan balance grows higher than your
home value (in which case the lender would lose money on your
loan). The payment for this insurance is called a mortgage insurance
premium (MIP) and is based on a percentage of your interest rate.
Non-recourse loan: This describes all major reverse mortgages
and states that you can never owe more than your home is worth
when your loan is repaid.
One-month secondary market CD index: The interest rate Fannie
Mae bases your rate on, as determined by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System. 
Originator: The person who actually makes your loan a reality.
Originators provide documents, help you choose the right loan,
send all of your paperwork through to the lender, and answer any
and all questions you may have along the way.
Planned unit development (PUD): One of the housing types eligi-
ble for most reverse mortgages, a PUD consists of a subdivision or
other project that shares common property (like a community
pool or clubhouse).
Principal: The amount of your loan before interest, fees, or any
other additions.
Property tax deferral (PTD): Another type of state reverse mort-
gage, PTDs help you pay your property taxes. This loan is a good
choice if your sole reason for getting a reverse mortgages is to take
care of these payments. They are very inexpensive to get, and
occasionally do not need to be repaid at all.
Proprietary reverse mortgage: Any reverse mortgage that is
owned by a private company. Of the three major reverse mortgage
products, that includes Fannie Mae’s Home Keeper and Financial
Freedom’s Jumbo Cash Account, although there are others.
Quit claim deed: This removes someone’s name from title or own-
ership of a property. For instance, if a child’s name had been added
Appendix: Glossary 255

on title to their parents’ home, the child needs to sign a quit claim
deed to remove his or her name so the parents could obtain the
reverse mortgage.
Repair addendum: If the appraiser recommends repairs, this docu-
ment spells out the specific repairs needed, the conditions of the
work done, and the timeframe.
Reverse mortgage: Any home loan that provides you with an
equity advance (either monthly, as a lump sum, or in a line of
credit) that is not payable until you move out or die (or at a spe-
cific time if you’ve chosen an uninsured loan, which is not covered
in this book).
Right of rescission: The three-day time period after your loan closes
in which you can still change your mind and revoke the loan.
Servicing: The maintenance on your loan after it closes (done by
the servicer), which usually includes sending checks, updating
information, changing your preferred payment options, providing
you with regular statements to show how your reverse mortgage
loan amount is growing, and day-to-day paperwork.
Supplemental Security Income (SSI): An income program for those
over 65, which operates in addition to social security. SSI benefits
may be affected by your reverse mortgage income.
Tenure payments: Monthly equal payments throughout the life of
the loan, which continue until you move out or die.
Term payments: Monthly equal payments that are paid for a speci-
fied amount of time.
Title: A legal document that proves ownership of a property. When
you apply for a reverse mortgage, your originator orders a title
search to make sure no one else holds any claims to your property.
Total Annual Loan Cost (TALC) rate: The estimated cost of the
loan to you, per year. This is a hypothetical projection, since you
won’t pay anything until the entire loan balance is due.
T-rate index: The U.S. Treasury Securities rate, which is used as
the index for the HECM loan.
Uninsured reverse mortgage: Unlike those discussed here, this is
a reverse mortgage that becomes due and payable on a specific
date. These are sometimes a dangerous choice, so talk to your
counselor and originator before pursuing an uninsured loan.
