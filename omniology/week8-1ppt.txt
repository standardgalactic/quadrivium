Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonad Axis

Sexual Differentiation 
Primordial germ cells in male & female generated in 
embryogenesis.  
 
Chromosomal sex determinants are XX and XY.  
 
Expression of the SRY gene on chromosome Y results in testes 
(male).  
 
Presence of testes vs ovaries determines gonadal sex. 
 
Gonads are the source of hormone which determines external 
and internal genitalia (phenotypic sex). 
 
The SRY gene is necessary for maleness but not sufficient. The  
testosterone receptor gene on the X chromosome is also 
required. 

Common Axis 
In males & females, GnRH secretion is pulsatile. 
 
Local secretion of testosterone is needed for development of ovum (female) and of sperm (male).   
 
Inhibin B decreases FSH secretion. Sex hormones regulate GnRH, LH and FSH.

Maturation of the H-P-Gonad Axis 
At puberty, adult pattern of GnRH secretion is attained. 
Male = 24 hr cycle. 
Female = 28 day cycle. 
Maturation requires kisspeptin and GRP54 activity in hypothalamic neurons secreting GnRH. 

Key Concepts 
Differentiation of germ cells as well as synthesis and secretion of 
sex hormones are common functions of the ovaries and testes. 
 
Reproduction in both males and females is controlled by pulsatile 
secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus which controls FSH and 
LH secretion from the pituitary.   
 
FSH and LH govern germ cell maturation and sex steroid hormone 
production in both males and females.  
 
Sex steroid hormones regulate FSH and LH by negative feedback 
(through kisspeptin neurons), are required for fertility and 
secondary sexual physical characteristics.
