“ I have personally been 
able to leverage many of 
the valuable insights and 
takeaways they shared 
with my team at Disney 
to structure formal 
design critique sessions, 
and it has helped to make 
our design process even 
more effective.”

at The Walt Disney Company
“ Adam and Aaron are 
creating a great dialogue 
around the importance 
of critique and how to 
do it well. I haven’t seen 
anyone else really bring 
this topic to the forefront. 
I’ll be recommending their 
book to all my clients.”

Real critique has become a lost skill among teams today. 
Critique is intended to help teams strengthen their 
designs, products, and services, rather than be used 
to assert authority or push agendas under the guise 
of “feedback.” In this practical guide, Adam Connor 
and Aaron Irizarry teach you techniques and tools for 
helping members of your team give and receive critique.
Using firsthand lessons from prominent figures in 
the design community, this book examines the good, 
the bad, and the ugly of feedback. You’ll come away 
with tips, actionable insights, and activities for making 
critique a part of your collaborative process.
Topics Include:
■
■Best practices (and anti-patterns) for giving 
and receiving critique
■
■Cultural aspects that influence your ability 
to critique constructively
■
■When, how much, and how often to use 
critique in the creative process
■
■Facilitation techniques for making critiques 
timely and more effective 
■
■Strategies for dealing with difficult people 
and challenging situations
Adam Connor, VP of Organizational Design at Mad*Pow, 
helps teams improve their own ability to create and 
collaborate effectively.
Aaron Irizarry, Director of User Experience for Nasdaq 
Product Design, provides workshops to help product teams 
improve the discussion around product design.

[ Foreword ]
Critique requires an investment.
This investment certainly comes from the person who provides the cri­
tique; he has an obligation upon accepting the request to provide you 
with an ability to act and/or react to his input. (There is a bit of beauty 
here in that you get to decide how to act and/or react to his input, and 
that can be to do nothing with it. You should, of course, be prepared to 
explain why you did nothing with it.)
Your investment (and your responsibility), however, is much, much 
greater. It is you who are obligated to set up your audience to provide 
you the critique that you want and need through a structured request. 
It is you who needs to provide people a proper context—the scope and 
goals for the critique—to set the proper expectations and to frame the 
critique that allow you to explore possible improvements.
This might sound simple enough; however, the reality is that most 
people don’t operate under any formal rules of critique. Instead, a lot 
of times designs are shared over email, through project management 
software or other design-sharing services, in chat, or through other 
rather narrow communication channels. Reactions and responses turn 
up in Reply All bullet points, fragments of disjointed and combined 
discussion threads, and even worse, piecemeal over a period of time.
Indeed, hell can be other people.
In many cases, we’re to blame.
Designers have to not only respond and react, they also have to try to 
organize and coordinate discussions, thoughts, and debates and then 
try to iterate. And then, the process is repeated again (and sometimes 
again, and again) as a new draft is sent around again, bereft of context 
or explanation of what’s been updated.

�������  |   Foreword
This is time consuming and fraught with potential mistakes and out-
of-scope requests. And, for the love of all things holy, think of the time­
lines and budgets!
Unfortunately, this really isn’t uncommon. It’s possible that you were 
just nodding your head in agreement while you were reading that, 
thinking of that one project that was such a tremendous pain at that 
one employer where the client, the boss, and everyone else were so 
impossible to work with. I get it. I’ve been there in the thick of that 
trap, and I’ve perpetuated it, too.
It doesn’t have to be any of these ways, and picking up this book is your 
first step toward ensuring that those vicious cycles stop happening 
around—or worse, because of—you. The most successful designers 
know that good, structured critique guides them through the design 
process and helps them to produce their best work. They know that 
they bear the burden of ensuring they get what they need from others 
involved in the project in order to make a design work, and they know 
that this helps make it a lot easier to sell their work to their clients.
Read this book. Read every last page of its critique-detailing goodness. 
And then apply it to your design practice. You’ll make some mistakes 
along the way; however, you’ll also find yourself improving at critique 
from your very first attempt. Before you know it, you won’t consider any 
other way to create your best work.
Adam and Aaron are two of the best designers I know, and this is largely 
due to their focus on unlocking the vault that holds all the secrets to 
good, structured critique. They’re not only great designers, they’re also 
kind and generous souls who are sharing all that they’ve learned with 
us so that we, too, can be better designers and serve our clients and our 
purpose as best as we can.
I’ve been lucky—I’ve been able to witness Aaron and Adam as they’ve 
gone through the exploration of critique. What started as a joint presen­
tation turned into a website. That then turned into workshops at some 
of the best-known conferences around the globe, which then turned 
into a detailed book proposal, which finally turned into the book you’re 
holding in your hands. I’ve learned so much along the way, and I’ve 
improved my own practices and approach to design critique along the 
way. I’ve been able to work with teams where we invested a very small 
percentage of our time in critique and in turn felt that the investment

was returned incrementally. I’ve put their practices into use in the prac­
tice of design and also in content creation, presentations, teaching, and 
more.
This critique stuff works.
This book is a lot like reliving Adam and Aaron’s journey for me, and 
it’s a reminder of all the things that I can still do better through the 
practice of proper critique. I look forward to hearing your stories about 
how critique has helped change and improve all that you do, too.

[ Preface ]
The Lost Skill of Critique
“Make it pop some more.”
“I don’t really like it… I am not sure why, but this isn’t it… I’ll know it 
when I see it.”
“What the hell is this?”
“Can you make it look like Apple?”
“You should move that text to the top of the page and make all of the 
buttons icons.”
If you have spent any time building, designing, or crafting something—
or working with those who do—you have probably heard something 
along the lines of these statements, which are often followed by 
something like, “Well, I’m just giving you some feedback.” 
Or, perhaps you were part of a program in school that included critique 
where your professor tried to “break you down” for your own good. 
Although this is not the situation in all academic settings, some schools 
and educators use critique and feedback sessions as a way to prepare 
students for the “real world,” but often they just leave students upset 
and with some bad memories.
There is a lot of ambiguity around feedback and why we share it with 
others. When feedback lacks a focus and appropriate purpose it is coun­
terproductive and can even be harmful at times. Even in social inter­
actions we see this type of feedback being used to express opinions. So 
often, when a new product is released or updated, before you know it 
the masses are providing 140 characters of opinion about what should 
have been done or created.

�������  |   Preface
The more we hear stories (and experience situations ourselves) of out-
of-context opinions, harsh phrases, and directional statements shared 
as feedback, we’ve seen that the real value and utility of feedback as part 
of design and creative processes being lost.
In short, we’ve forgotten how to critique. Because of this—and because 
of how feedback often is used—we harm not only the products and 
services we create, but our teams, organizations, and working relation­
ships, as well.
Critique is supposed to be helpful. It should be an analysis that helps 
us understand what is working and what isn’t and whether we are on 
the right track toward reaching our goals. But the critique and feed­
back we see in so many teams doesn’t do this. Instead it’s often used 
as a way for individuals to assert their own authority or push their own 
perspectives and objectives. It could be someone trying show expertise 
to others in the room by pointing out all of a design’s faults without the 
real intention to help the design get better. I have also seen individuals 
pick a design apart as a way to eliminate any competition between the 
design being reviewed and their design.
The practice of real critique has become a lost skill.
The lines have become blurred in relation to feedback, critique, and 
how we communicate while working together. So the questions arise. 
What can we do to better understand the issues that are keeping us 
from productively talking about what we are designing and ensuring 
that it meets the goals that were set for it? How can we improve the way 
in which we give and receive critique so that it is helpful?
What This Book Is About
This books sets out to answer these questions in a way that provides 
individuals, teams, and organizations with techniques, tools, and 
resources that will help them improve the quality and usefulness of the 
conversations surrounding ideas and designs within their teams and 
with their clients.
We will analyze and define critique and examine the good, the bad, 
and the ugly of both giving and receiving it. We’ll examine the cultural 
aspects that support or hinder critique. And, we will provide tips and 
insights on how to integrate critique as a part of your process.

 Preface   |  xi
Why We Wrote This Book
This book was born from many conversations that Adam and I were 
having separately with our peers on the topics of feedback and how we 
would like to see it improve in our practices and community. A mutual 
friend, Whitney Hess, gave us the idea to collaborate on this content 
together. Before long a blog post turned into a conference submission, 
which in turn grew into many talks and workshops at conferences and 
for companies across the United States.
The more we heard individuals’ stories and were asked about how 
this content could be worked into various teams and environments it 
became clear that putting together a book that could be used both as an 
examination of critique and communication as well as a reference for 
advice and tips would prove helpful.
That is the core of why we wrote this book. We have been there. We 
have heard the harsh feedback and tried to work with a lack of use­
ful comments and “suggestions.” We have felt the nervousness of pre­
senting designs to teams and clients for feedback and we have had our 
designs shredded and picked apart, leaving us feeling defeated.
We have also felt the satisfaction that comes from having produc­
tive conversations about what we are designing, feeling like you can 
do something actionable with the insights gathered. We wrote this 
book to help teams better communicate about what they are designing 
together, to improve collaboration, and establish a framework for pro­
ductive critiques.
Who Should Read This Book
Maybe you’re thinking, “That’s all well and good, but I’m not a designer 
or artist. Why should I read this book?”
To that, we’d look you dead in the eye and say something like, 
“Designers and artists don’t own critique. Critique is for anyone who 
wants to improve anything that they are building or doing. Critique 
isn’t a ‘design’ skill, it’s a life skill.”
This book has been written based on experiences that included multi­
ple roles within teams and organizations: product owners, project man­
agers, designers, developers, executives, marketing professionals, and 
more. If you are a part of a team or project working to design or create 
something, you are a part of the conversation surrounding it. This book

serves as a reference for anyone who is a part of the process and can 
help team members work to improve how they communicate and col­
laborate with one another.
Terms We Use
Though we have written this book for anyone who is a part of building 
something, we are using some general terms throughout the book for 
the sake of consistency.
We will use designer to refer to anyone who has come up with an idea or 
works on the creation of an idea in any way.
We will use the term product to refer to whatever it is that is being cre­
ated or is being proposed.
Critique and feedback are often seen as interchangeable terms, and to 
some extent they are; we will explore common misunderstandings of 
these terms and how they work together best.
How This Book Is Organized
This book will cover the various aspects of critique, its definition, and 
how we interact with one another in critique settings.
Chapter 1: Understanding Critique
In Chapter 1, we explain the various forms of feedback that are often 
seen in a critique setting, the challenges that come from specific forms 
of feedback, and the types of feedback we should look to gather. We will 
also discuss the various perceptions associated with critique.
Chapter 2: What Critique Looks Like
In the second chapter, we talk about what critique looks like and the 
importance of intent in the critique process. We also cover best prac­
tices for giving and receiving critique and tips on how to know when 
you are not giving good critique.
Chapter 3: Culture and Critique
Chapter 3 explores aspects of our individual and organizational cul­
tures that influence our ability to effectively critique. We also look at 
some of the common barriers that you can encounter when trying to 
establish a productive critique practice.

In addition, we discuss the foundational elements that teams can use to 
effectively critique any effort, such as goals, principles, and scenarios. 
Chapter 4: Making Critique a Part of Your Process
In Chapter 4, we talk through making critique a part of your process, 
and some of the challenges that come with this effort. We will cover 
things to remember when making critique a part of your process. We 
will also cover the areas where we see critique taking place (standalone 
critiques, design reviews, and collaborative activities) and their dif­
ferences. Chapter 4 also covers when, how much, and how often we 
should critique.
Chapter 5: Facilitating Critique
Facilitation plays a key role in critique. In Chapter 5, we dive into this 
skill and how to use it to keep critiques effective and on track.
We share rules that you can use to help participants understand how 
a critique session is supposed to run and what to avoid doing to help 
make the session productive.
Chapter 5 also covers how to prepare for, kick off, run, and follow up 
after a critique. It includes tips on who to include as participants, advice 
for presenting designs, and making sure everyone understands not 
only the goals of the product but the goals of the critique session.
Chapter 6: Critiquing with Difficult People 
and in Challenging Situations
It’s inevitable that as you work to improve collaboration, communica­
tion, and critique, you’ll encounter situations and individuals that pres­
ent a challenge. In Chapter 6, we examine some common challenging 
situations and strategies we can use to work through them.
We’ll also discuss what to do when people become difficult in a cri­
tique, providing tips and techniques for dealing with them and still 
salvaging the critique. If you’ve ever experienced someone giving you a 
list of changes or a design showing what they want instead of feedback, 
we explain how to respond and get back on a path to critique.
We hope that the breakout of these chapters will not only provide a solid 
understanding of critique as you read through it, but that they are bro­
ken out in such a way that they can be used as a reference when needed.

Understanding Critique
Conversations Matter
Whether you’re a developer, project manager, designer, business ana­
lyst, and so on, it’s more than likely that you’ve been in a meeting in 
which the topic of “design” has come up explicitly or otherwise. No 
matter what you’re designing—a tool, a service, a product, a brochure, 
a logo, whatever it might be—you’re going to be involved in conversa­
tions about how it works, what it can do, what it contains, how it looks, 
and more.
Collaboration and coordination are critical elements in the success of 
projects in most (if not all) modern organizations. There isn’t a sin­
gle individual who is responsible for coming up with an idea, design­
ing it, building it, selling it, and supporting it. Instead, these respon­
sibilities and the expertise that come with them are divided among 
a variety of contributors who each bring knowledge to the team. So, 
we need to work together, combining our skills and know-how. And to 
work together, we need to talk with one another. We need to discuss 
what it is we’re designing, why we’re creating it, and how it will all come 
together.
But as many of us have experienced, conversations about design can 
turn painful. At a minimum, when these discussions go wrong, they 
delay progress. They seem to go nowhere. People disagree, argue, and 
team members walk away not sure what to do next.
Although individual instances like this might not seem like a huge 
deal, it’s the culmination of discussions that go this way that really 
affects a team. Over time, delays accumulate; the resulting lack of 
momentum and repeated questioning of what to do next gives rise to a 
sense that none of the team members seem to agree, which has a tre­
mendous negative impact on people. They stop wanting to collaborate

and they begin to care less and less about the project. In some cases 
they begin to silo themselves, feeling that because they can only control 
their own output, it will be their sole focus without regard to the other 
team members and how it effects them.
In some cases, though, these conversations can become much worse. 
As people talk about what they think should or should not be a part of 
the design, it’s not uncommon for individuals to become emotional. For 
some, this can be difficult to control, which can lead to people getting 
defensive, tempers flaring, yelling, berating, and lines being crossed.
The intent of this book is to help make the conversations that happen 
as a part of projects more effective and productive with regard to their 
objectives. These discussions are always happening. Sometimes, they 
take place in a formal setting such as a meeting. Sometimes, they’re 
more informal, perhaps when we’re standing in line to pay for a cup of 
coffee. No matter where these conversations occur, we need to be able 
to discuss our work.
Unfortunately, we don’t often take time to examine these conversations 
and understand what makes them good or bad. This book looks at the 
elements of these conversations and the patterns through which they 
arise. It also describes best practices for making these conversations 
more productive to projects and toward strengthening a team’s ability 
to collaborate through incorporation of critique, an often-overlooked 
component of the design process.
The Problem with Asking for “Feedback”
Requesting feedback on a design or idea is one of the most common 
ways design discussions are initiated. Feedback is a common element 
and activity in not just our workplace cultures, but in many social cul­
tures, as well. “Feedback” is a word that’s become ingrained in our 
vocabulary. We use it all the time, à la “I’d love to get your feedback on 
something…”
During a project, a designer might just grab someone at a nearby desk 
because she wants to take a break from putting her design together 
and think about what she’s done so far. Or the feedback request might 
be part of a planned milestone or date in the project’s timeline, often 
called Design Reviews.

It’s not that either of these is a bad time to get other opinions. Rather, 
the real problems we encounter come from the word “feedback” itself, 
what it means, and how we ask for it. 
WHAT IS FEEDBACK?
The issue with feedback lies in how nonspecific it is. Feedback itself is 
nothing more than a reaction or response. Designers talk about feedback 
and feedback loops as an important element in design all the time. In 
a feedback loop, after an individual takes an action, the object or envi­
ronment on or in which that action has taken place changes (or reacts). 
The individual then interprets that change or reaction in consideration 
of what they’ll do next. (See Figure 1-1.)
FIGURE 1-1
The three stages of a feedback loop
Figure 1-2 depicts a feedback loop designed by the team at Ready For 
Zero. In it, as a user manipulates the sliders or values of the various 
fields in the form to figure out her payment plan on a credit card, the 
other values all adjust instantaneously. This allows the user to see the 
effect that adjusting a value, like her monthly payment amount, will 
have on the total amount she pays and how much she might save.

4  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
FIGURE 1-2
Example of a feedback loop in UI design from Ready For Zero
That reaction—the noticeable change in the appearance or state of the 
system—is the feedback. It is the system’s response to what the user 
has done. Feedback is a reaction that occurs as a result of the user doing 
something.
In human-to-human interactions such as the conversations we have in 
our projects, the feedback we receive might be nothing more than a gut 
reaction to whatever is being presented. And to be quite honest, even 
though we might not want to admit it, that’s often all it is.
Someone’s reaction tells us a bit about how he feels regarding what has 
happened or been designed, which can be useful in some cases, but 
also presents us with some challenges. Chapter 2 points out that a reac­
tion on its own doesn’t go far enough to be helpful in allowing us to 
improve our designs and move forward in our projects. Not only that, 
the reaction might be based upon the personal biases and preferences 
of the individual who is reacting, which might or might not align with 
a mindset representative of the audience for our product.
There is a popular saying in many design communities: “You are not 
the user.” It’s important to keep that in mind when we’re discussing 
the things we’re designing and deciding what should or shouldn’t be a 
part of them. It’s not that we only want feedback from users, but when 
collecting feedback from people in other roles we need to ensure that 
the user’s needs, goals, and contexts are kept in mind.

 1. Understanding Critique   |  5
The problem with asking for feedback is that, most times, we aren’t 
being specific enough in describing what we want feedback on and why 
we are asking for it. Sometimes, the feedback we receive might just be 
a gut reaction. Sometimes, we might get back a list of instructions or 
suggestions on what to change. Sometimes, we might get comments 
that describe how what we’ve designed doesn’t match what the critic 
would have designed. Weeding through all of that feedback to try to 
determine what’s of use to us—what will help us identify the aspects of 
our design that we should iterate upon—can be a struggle.
Central Idea
Feedback is an important part of the design process, but the term itself and 
the way we often ask for it is very broad and can produce conversations that 
aren’t useful. We can improve these conversations by understanding what 
feedback is and how we use it.
THREE KINDS OF FEEDBACK
There are three forms of feedback, all of which vary in their degree 
of usefulness to us in the design process. Understanding these three 
kinds of feedback can help us understand the conversations we have 
with our teams and improve our own ability to react to and use feed­
back to strengthen our designs.
The first two types of feedback
Figure 1-3 illustrates how reaction-based feedback tends to be emo­
tional or visceral. It happens quickly and instinctively. This type of 
feedback is often filled with passion. It’s driven by someone’s personal 
expectations, desires, and values. Essentially, it’s a gut reaction.

6  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
FIGURE 1-3
An example of reactive feedback
There is another kind of reaction-based feedback that is driven by the 
individual’s understanding of what they are expected to say, typically 
driven by a cultural understanding or what they think the presenter 
wants to hear. In this case, the reaction itself isn’t in regard to what’s 
being presented; rather, it’s in response to simply being asked for feed­
back in the first place. Examples of this kind of feedback often take the 
form of “That’s wonderful! Great work!” or “I love what you did with…”
Why it can be an issue
At best, this kind of feedback informs us about the subconscious reac­
tion the viewer has to what you’ve designed. These kinds of reactions 
are something we do want to understand when designing a product 
or service. It’s not ideal to try to sell something potential customers 
or users cringe at or grumble about the second they see it. But are the 
people from whom you’ve asked for feedback reflective of your design’s 
actual audience? Are they looking at it the same way your potential 
users would? Does this reaction divulge anything specific about any of 
the design decisions you’ve made so far or their effectiveness?

Direction
Direction-based feedback, as seen in Figure 1-4, typically begins with 
an instruction or suggestion. In many cases that’s also where it ends. 
In this form of feedback, the individual providing it is often looking for 
ways to bring the design more in line with their own expectations of 
what the solution should be. You might also have encountered exam­
ples of this kind of feedback that start with phrasing similar to, “If I 
were to do this…” or “I would have…” or “I wish…”
FIGURE 1-4
An example of directive feedback
In all of these, the individual giving the feedback is trying to communi­
cate her own vision for the design. It might be because she has her own 
detailed solution already in mind, or it might be that she feels a prob­
lem is not being adequately solved. In some cases, the individual will 
go on to describe why she is making the suggestion, which can shed a 
bit more light on her thinking and motives.

8  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Why it can be an issue
Similar to reaction-based feedback, direction-based feedback without 
any explanation indicates nothing about the effectiveness of your deci­
sions in meeting the design’s objectives. Sure, if the person giving you 
feedback is the one who will ultimately approve the design, she might 
supply you with a to-do list that you could act upon to get her approval, 
but getting that approval and creating an effective design are not nec­
essarily the same things.
For situations in which the individual also gives some explanation as 
to why she is making the suggestion, you at least begin to understand 
the impetus and perhaps the issue she’s trying to address with it. But, 
it still does not help you understand how or why the design you have is 
or is not effective at addressing that problem.
Additionally, when left unchecked, this type of feedback leads to prob­
lem solving which, although an important part of the design process, 
is counterproductive to the conversation you’re trying to have. It’s not 
that the direction itself that is being given is a bad idea, but at this point 
it’s out of place. We look further into problem solving and its impact in 
Chapter 5.
How to deal with reactive and directive feedback will be examined fur­
ther in Chapters 5 and 6. For now, what’s most important is to under­
stand what these forms lack in terms of their usefulness in helping us 
to improve our designs.
WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS CRITICAL THINKING
Critical thinking is the process of taking a statement and determining 
if it is true or false. When we’re designing something, we’re doing so to 
meet or achieve some set of objectives. When looking for feedback on 
our designs, we should be working to understand whether we believe 
that what has been designed will work to achieve those objectives. We 
should be looking for a form of analysis to take place. And that’s exactly 
what critique is.
Critique: The third form of feedback
It’s this form of feedback that is most helpful to us in understanding 
the impact of our design decisions.

Good critique is comprised of three key elements:
•	 It identifies a specific aspect of the idea or a decision in the design 
being analyzed.
•	 It relates that aspect or decision to an objective or best practice.
•	 It describes how and why the aspect or decision work to support or 
not support the objective or best practice.
FIGURE 1-5

10  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Let’s look at Figure 1-5 and examine its parts to see how they align with 
these three elements:
•	 If the objective is for users to seriously consider the impact to their bank 
balance before making a purchase… This states the objective the per­
son giving the feedback is analyzing.
•	 …placing the balance at the bottom of the screen at the same size as 
all the other numbers… This segment identifies the design choices 
made that are being analyzed.
•	 …isn’t effective because it gets lost in all of the other information. This 
part tells the designer that the critic does not believe the choices he 
made will be effective and why.
Critique isn’t about that instant reaction we might feel when seeing 
something, or about how we would change someone’s design to better 
solve an issue. Critique is a form of analysis that uses critical thinking 
to determine whether a design is expected to achieve its desired objec­
tives (and adhere to any pertinent best practices or heuristics).
Those objectives can be any number of types of things. They can be 
about utility, for example giving someone the ability to complete a task. 
They can be about metrics and measurement, as in increasing the 
number of conversions for a particular call to action. Or, they can be 
experiential, for example making someone feel excited or surprised by 
something.
Chapter 3 provides more details about the role of these objectives in 
design projects and in setting the foundation for productive conversa­
tions, but hopefully this begins to give you a sense of how critique dif­
fers from other forms of feedback.
Knowing what we want and what we’re asking for makes all the differ­
ence in how our conversations play out. It might seem like little more 
than semantics, and it’s damned difficult to give up using the word 
“feedback” when asking to talk with people about an idea or design (in 
fact, we’ll be using it over and over again in this book). But, as you’ll 
see as you read the coming chapters, what’s important is to understand 
the differences in forms of feedback and to use that understanding to 
inform how you ask people and facilitate the resulting conversations.

Central Idea
Feedback encompasses three forms: reaction, direction, and critique. 
Reaction and direction are limited in their ability to help us understand if 
the design choices we’ve made might work toward the product’s objec-
tives. Critique, a form of analysis that uses critical thinking, is feedback that 
focuses on exactly that understanding.
CRITIQUING SOLO
This book centers on critique as a form of conversation we have with 
our teams. But it’s important to note that an individual can and should 
also critique alone, analyzing his own work.
When designing something, the brain operates as a toggle, switching 
between creative thinking—where individuals are generating ideas or 
assembling parts of ideas—and analytical thinking—where they are 
determining whether what they’ve designed so far is in line with what 
they are trying to achieve. Experienced designers, artists, engineers, 
and others have learned how to be deliberate in controlling when to 
make this toggle, periodically pausing their creative work to take a step 
back and critique what they have so far.
Why Critique Is So Important
Throughout this book we’ll dive deeper into the various ways critique 
fits into the design process, but as we get started, it’s important to iden­
tify these patterns and benefits in order to keep in mind the broader 
application of the concept.
CRITIQUE BUILDS SHARED VOCABULARIES
Have you ever noticed how as people spend more and more time 
together they begin to talk like one another? They begin to use the 
same phrasing of words and names for things. This is a natural occur­
rence in social groupings—it’s part of a process called acculturation.
www.it-ebooks.info

12  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Intuitively, we seek out efficiency in communication with others. 
Communication between individuals grew out of the need of one indi­
vidual to produce action by another. It isn’t very effective if we need to 
spend all of our time getting our point across. As we build a shared 
understanding of what words and phrases mean among a group, we 
instinctively begin to use them over other words that might mean 
the same thing. By avoiding words that aren’t as easily recognized by 
the others in the group, we streamline and improve the quality of our 
conversations.
One challenge project teams face in collaboration is the variety of lan­
guage used by people in different roles. Members from IT, design, and 
business might all have different ways of referring to the same thing. 
By bringing your project team together to critique on a recurring basis, 
you provide a venue for this shared vocabulary to build up and take 
hold. As that vocabulary is being built, it’s happening across roles and 
silos, improving the ability of team members to communicate more 
efficiently with members of other roles.
CRITIQUE AS CONSENSUS FINDER
Design-by-committee and “frankensteining” (the mashing up of 
design elements, features, and so on from various ideas and sources) 
are much-hated phenomena in the design community. Both terms are 
often used to imply the misguided amalgamation of ideas into a final 
design without any attention paid to their disharmony or whether they 
really work to achieve the desired outcomes.
In environments where this takes place, the driving force is typically 
to get those involved, particularly stakeholders, all saying yes to what 
is being designed without regard to whether what is being designed is 
actually the best solution. And so, bits and pieces are added to appease 
the various influencers of the project. But here’s the thing: there isn’t 
anything wrong with combining elements from different ideas to make 
a new one. The weakness here is the reasons why the elements being 
combined are selected. Critique is what’s missing from the process. 
Selections aren’t necessarily based on the elements of an idea that are 
most effective toward a particular objective.
In these environments, critique might still be happening, but it’s typ­
ically found happening in a small corner of the project team. A few 
people, maybe the designers and developers, are doing it but the entire 
team isn’t.

What Aaron and I have found in teams that carry a culture of critique 
is that, at any time, these discussions involve members of the team 
from across departments and disciplines. It becomes a natural part of 
the way they talk with one another. It isn’t always a formal meeting 
or a specific request such as, “Could I get you to critique something 
with me?” As the project progresses and decisions are made, critique 
is just part of the conversation. Members are consistently focused on 
and discussing the elements of the design that work best to achieve its 
goals. Consensus begins to be found around which ideas are stronger 
or weaker, and the design is strengthened as a result.
Years back, on a project that involved the creation of a new insurance 
application and processing platform, I got a call from one of the devel­
opers. She had been working on building out some of the functional­
ity I had prototyped for the initial submission of an application. While 
doing so, she was stopped by a stakeholder who had an idea for a 
new piece of functionality that they were hoping could be added to 
the screens. A few minutes later, the developer had given me a call (I 
worked in another office), set up a screen-share, and she, the stake­
holder, and I were discussing the new functionality and the ideas for its 
inclusion in the design.
As we did, we referred back to the task flows and scenarios we’d cre­
ated for this particular set of functionally as well as the goals we had 
for individuals using it. In doing so, we quickly realized that the func­
tionality itself didn’t fit the objectives we were after. It would have cre­
ated an awkward branch in the task flow and more work for the user. 
We also saw, though, that the main point of this new functionality was 
to give the users (insurance agents) a view of a key piece of data that 
had been missing from our designs. When we realized that and agreed 
that being able to see that data was important to our objectives, we 
were able to generate a few ideas for adding the data value to the 
screen in an effective manner. The entire process took less than 30 
minutes, and afterward, the stakeholder, developer, and I all walked 
away, confident that we had improved the design.
—ADAM
In the preceding story, even though critique wasn’t sought out explic­
itly, it was a key part of the conversation and decision-making process. 
This is what we mean when we talk about critique being part of a great 
team’s natural language. Yes, the team might carve out specific times

and meetings for a formal critique session, but critique also finds its 
way into other conversations. The team understands that in order to 
make good decisions about what to design and how to design it, it 
needs to think critically about its options and objectives.
CRITIQUE AS ITERATION DRIVER
Critique is part and parcel of an iterative process. Chapter 3 spends 
more time looking at iteration, but it can’t be understated how closely 
these two are tied. If we’re going to look at design as an iterative pro­
cess—something that takes a creation and evolves it from idea to final 
product and further—there need to be points in our process that drive 
that evolution and indicate where changes should be made moving for­
ward (that is, the next iteration).
Many organizations use various testing and observation methods such 
as usability studies and beta releases to do this today, but depending 
on your market and audience, these approaches can take a lot of time. 
Sometimes, you just need to take a quick step back. In the early stages 
of design, my team at Mad*Pow might iterate three or four times on 
a design in a single day. All we do is ensure that after sketching and 
developing ideas for a period of time, maybe as short as 10 to 15 min­
utes or as long as a few hours, we stop and examine what we have so far 
against our objectives and best practices. Iterations don’t always have to 
be huge readjustments of the entire design. Sometimes, they might be 
much smaller and focused on a handful or even just one interaction, or 
flow or design element.
In these cases, the drivers of our iterations are the discussions our teams 
regularly go through. Most are self-induced, meaning that they’re not 
dictated by a date in someone’s project plan; rather, they can be initi­
ated by the designer or design team when they feel like it’s time to take 
a break from designing and look critically at what they have so far.
Central Idea
Because critique, when done well, focuses on analyzing design choices 
against a product’s objectives, it also provides teams with additional bene-
fits, acting as a mechanism for building shared vocabulary, finding relevant 
consensus, and driving effective iteration.

By now, we hope that you are thinking about the processes your own 
organization goes through in projects. That’s exactly what this book is 
about, but hopefully you’ve noticed that what we’re really talking about 
here is something that applies beyond the boundaries of a business or 
organization. It applies any time and to any activity or thing you want 
to improve, whether it be improving a new recipe; honing your skills in 
Ultimate Frisbee; playing the ukulele; or painting portraits of people’s 
pets with macaroni, hot-glue, and food coloring. Whatever it is, you can 
incorporate critique to help you improve upon it.
As mentioned earlier, critique is really about critical thinking. As we 
work toward doing or designing something with a set of objectives in 
mind, we always have the opportunity to stop and analyze what we’ve 
done so far to better inform how we might go forward. Critique is an 
act of reflection. It is part of the learning process. If Aaron and I might 
be so bold as to say, critique is a life skill, not a design skill.
GIVING CRITIQUE THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES
If critique is so important, why don’t people pay more attention to it? 
Why don’t teams take time to practice and talk about it?
Improving the quality of critique, or more specifically, improving a 
team’s skills at facilitating and giving critique, should become a pri­
ority. Doing so can be tremendously valuable and can result in better 
collaboration, efficiency, and designs. The first steps to doing this are 
to overcome three myths that are often part, if not all, of the cause for 
critique to be overlooked.
Myth 1: Critique is a meaningless term used to make feedback 
sound more important
This one is pretty weak, but it’s worth addressing because we’ve seen 
it come up in more than a few organizations with which we’ve worked. 
In media today, the term “critique” has become a label used to cate­
gorize anyone’s opinion on something. Media personalities, writers, 
pundits—anyone, really—can offer their perspective on a new prod­
uct, service, or policy and call it a critique. It’s come to mean nothing 
more than one person or group’s thoughts on what another person or

group has done. The aspects of critical thinking and of focusing on 
what the originating person or group’s intentions were have gone out 
the window.
But we know that that isn’t really what critique is about. Understanding 
the qualities that separate critique from other forms of feedback—and 
helping our teammates understand those qualities as well—results in 
more efficient, useful conversations.
Myth 2: We don’t need to talk about or practice how we give 
feedback
When your team engages in a postmortem or retrospective for a proj­
ect, what do you talk about? Most likely you talk about the decisions that 
were made, maybe a little about the process with regard to the kinds of 
meetings you had or when they happened. Have you ever talked about 
the language you use when talking to one another? Have you ever 
talked about how specific conversations were framed and facilitated?
When we think about our processes we tend to focus on a level higher 
than where the quality of critique is really influenced. Talking is some­
thing we take for granted, and so the details of how we do it are often 
glossed over. But there is that old cliché: the devil is in the details. Or, 
more accurately, it should be that the devil is in ignoring the details.
The ways we talk to one another, initiate conversations, ask questions, 
and so on all effect how our conversations unfold. If we really believe 
that those conversations are important to our team and project’s suc­
cess, then it stands to reason that thinking critically about them, talking 
about them, and practicing our techniques are important actions for 
improving them.
Myth 3: Critique is something only designers or other creative 
people do
Critique can sometimes be thrown into the “creative professional” silo 
as something only artists, designers, and the like do. It’s not for every­
one else.
What individuals and organizations that fall into this trap fail to real­
ize is that when a project is tasked with making something, no matter 
what it is, every single team member is a part of the design process. 
Design doesn’t just happen in the design department. It happens with

every decision about what will or won’t be part of the final product, 
whether that’s a feature, a paragraph of content, a color pallet, a user 
interface pattern—anything.
If we truly want to improve our processes and improve the way our 
team members work together, we can’t ignore the details and we can’t 
silo our critical thinking. Yes, there are roles and responsibilities that 
each team member will carry based on their expertise and knowledge, 
but critical thinking about what we’re designing is a part of every mem­
ber’s role.
Incorporating Critique and Moving Forward
The remainder of this book is about that role and the best practices and 
methods we have at our disposal for making sure it’s fulfilled. As we 
dive deeper into the details, you’ll begin to see just how pervasive cri­
tique can be, how many places it can pop up, and how many parts of 
your process it can help you to improve.
The ultimate goal for teams that are interested in improving conversa­
tions and collaboration with critique is not to add one more tool or type 
of meeting to their ever-growing toolbox. Instead, it’s to change the way 
we talk about what we’ve designed regardless of the type of meeting or 
conversation we’re in.
Critique itself is often referred to as a soft skill. Soft skills are often 
thought of as interpersonal behaviors and characteristics that influence 
how we interact and communicate with others. Whereas hard skills tend 
to be applicable to a specific task, action, or type of work, soft skills 
apply broadly across most activities and work. As we examine critique 
throughout the book, it’s important to keep in mind two key aspects: 
Critical thinking
This is the examination of what you’re designing against the objec­
tives for its creation.
Delivery
This is how you present your critical thinking to the others with 
whom you’re working.

18  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
It should also be noted that critique isn’t just about pictures. Often, 
it can be seen as a process that only applies to a wireframe or a visual 
design mockup or maybe a prototype, but in reality, critique can be 
applied to just about anything.
Any time you or your team construct something or make a decision 
about something in order to reach a specific goal or fulfill a certain 
objective, it is something that can be critiqued. For example, you’re 
team might establish a set of design principles to help guide you in 
deciding between ideas for an interface. There are best practices for 
establishing and using design principles. A good design principle 
should help you eliminate more ideas than you pursue, and it should be 
specific and avoid overly subjective and ambiguous terms like “fun.” As 
such, with best practices like these, when your team creates principles 
for your next product or project, you have an opportunity for critiquing 
your principles against them.
Central Idea
To ensure that our conversations with teammates are as useful as they can 
be, we need to think about how we apply critical thinking to the topics we 
discuss and how we share with others the insights we achieve as a result of 
that critical thinking.
Wrapping Up
Over the course of a project, team members will have countless con­
versations in which they collect or provide feedback on designs. 
Sometimes, these conversations can be unproductive, painful, or even 
toxic. Improving these conversations begins with understanding what 
critique is, how it relates to feedback, and the value it brings to our 
teams, projects, and products:
•	 Feedback has three forms: reaction, direction, and critique. 
Reaction and direction are limited on their own in helping us 
understand whether our design will work toward achieving its 
objectives.
www.it-ebooks.info

 1. Understanding Critique   |  19
•	 How we ask for and collect feedback has a significant effect on 
which forms of feedback we receive as well as its relevancy and 
usefulness in helping us to improve our designs.
•	 Critique, the third form of feedback, is analysis that uses critical 
thinking to ask whether what we’ve designed will work to achieve 
the established goals and objectives. It can, and should, be a part 
of any formal or informal discussion we have about what we’re 
designing.
•	 Beyond the benefits we get from the analysis done in critique, it 
also helps teams to do the following:
{
{ Build shared vocabularies, making communication more 
efficient.
{
{ Find consensus based on product objectives when deciding 
between multiple design options.
{
{ Inform and drive iteration on aspects of a design where they 
are most needed.
Unfortunately, critique is often overlooked for a number of reasons, but 
by recognizing its value and spending a little time understanding what 
it is and how it fits within our teams and processes, we can improve the 
quality of the conversations our team members have and make critique 
a natural part of our communication and process.

What Critique Looks Like
The Two Sides of Critique and the Importance 
of Intent
There are two sides, or roles, in any critique:
Recipient
The individual(s) receiving the critique (that is, the designer or pre­
senter of whatever is being analyzed) who will take the perspec­
tives and information raised during the critique, process it, and act 
upon it in some way.
Giver
The individual(s) giving the critique—the critics—who are being 
asked to think critically about the design and provide their thoughts 
and perspectives.
Within both of these roles there is the discrete aspect of intention: why 
are we asking for/receiving/giving feedback? Intent initiates conversa­
tion and is often what separates successful critiques and feedback dis­
cussions from problematic ones.
For the best discussions, the intent of each participant—regardless of 
whether they are receiving or giving critique—needs to be appropriate. 
If we aren’t careful, critique with the wrong or inappropriate intent on 
either side can lead to problems not only in our designs, but also in our 
ability to work with our teammates.
Receiving critique with the appropriate intent is about wanting to 
understand whether the elements of the design will work toward the 
established objectives for the product.

22  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Giving critique with the appropriate intent is about wanting to help the 
designer understand the effect that elements of the design will have on 
the product’s ability to achieve its objectives.
Both acts are done with the intention of using the information and 
perspectives raised during the critique to modify and strengthen the 
design. This is an important aspect of the discussion. Many of us 
have experienced meetings during which we’ve been asked to give 
our thoughts on something like a design, or a process, or maybe even 
a project (for example, a postmortem or retrospective). Over time, if 
these discussions repeatedly fail to produce action and changes, our 
desire to participate and provide our perspectives wanes.
Part of what makes for strong critiques is the desire to participate and 
to help. To be certain, everything said in a critique is not going to pro­
duce a discrete modification to the design. But overall, participants 
should feel that the discussion, to which they actively contributed, will 
play a role in improving the design—not just changing it, but strength­
ening its ability to produce the desired objectives.
Prior to beginning a critique, whether you’re the giver or receiver, it’s 
best to ensure that you’re going in with the right intent.
Giving Critique
Giving critique with the right intent is about wanting to contribute to 
the improvement of the design by helping the designer understand 
the relative success design elements will have in working toward the 
stated objectives. When we approach our feedback discussions with 
this mindset, we think critically about what we’re saying and why we’re 
saying it. By considering both the what and the why, we keep conversa­
tions productive.
To better understand what giving a good critique looks like, let’s first 
analyze some characteristics of bad critique. For more tips on han­
dling and working with unhelpful feedback and unwanted critique, see 
Chapter 6.
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BAD CRITIQUE
In most cases, what causes a critique to be characterized as “bad” is 
usually a set of behaviors or characteristics exhibited by those involved. 
The following subsections present a few that we have seen.

 2. What Critique Looks Like   |  23
Selfish
Bad critique can sometimes be the result of selfish intention. That’s not 
to say that it is always malicious, but it might be focused on or driven by 
the critic’s personal goals and come at the expense of the team or other 
individuals, specifically the designer of whatever is being discussed.
In extreme cases, selfish critique comes from the motivation of the 
giver to not only be heard and attract attention, but also to be recog­
nized as smarter or superior.
The most recognizable examples of this can be seen on social networks 
such as Twitter or Facebook whenever there is a change to a popular 
app, device, or other trend-worthy product. A new feature is added or 
something is changed, and people immediately begin slamming deci­
sions, labeling them ridiculous and stupid, and stating how things 
“should have been designed.”
But in most of these situations, the commenters have only a cursory 
understanding of what the designer or team was working toward and 
the constraints they were working within. How is this helpful?
When we do this (and Aaron and I are guilty of it, too), are we really 
trying to help someone improve his design? Or are we more interested 
in showing others in our community or organization how smart we are 
on a certain topic?
Selfish critique and feedback happens on project teams, as well. Maybe 
you’ve encountered it at work, are thinking of a colleague who’s done it 
to you, or maybe you’ve done it yourself.
Sometimes, this kind of feedback comes from having our own ideas 
of what we think the design should be, but not having had a chance 
to share them with the team. So, we set about to use feedback as an 
opportunity to propose our own alternative ideas for how something 
could be done. Although Aaron and I are firm believers that a great 
idea can come from anywhere, and team members in any role should 
be given an opportunity to share their ideas, doing so during a critique 
is detrimental.
As is discussed in Chapter 5, critique is not the place for exploring new 
ideas. Its purpose is to analyze the design as it has been created so far. 
Shifting a group from an analytical mindset to an explorative one is 
best done with deliberate facilitation.

24  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
It’s important here to recognize that not all selfish critique is mali­
cious. Some individuals might simply be unaware of their tone, or they 
have difficulty forming their feedback in a way that is useful. When 
presented with selfish feedback, we have an opportunity, and often a 
responsibility, to work to understand what someone is trying to tell us 
and determine if it is useful in helping to improve our design.
Untimely
Despite what you might think and what some people might even say, 
people aren’t always looking to hear feedback on their work. Unless 
someone has specifically told you that they would like your feedback, 
it’s unwise to think your conversation is a great opportunity to share 
your analysis with her. If someone is telling people about her creation, 
it might just be to get the word out or simply that she’s excited about 
the project.
For the receiver to really listen, process, and make use of critique, she 
needs to be in the proper mindset. Whether at a team member’s desk, 
in a meeting, or on social channels, when critique is uninvited, it can 
lead to defensiveness, communication breakdowns, and often paints 
the person giving the critique as a “know it all.”
Incomplete
For critique to be useful, the designer(s) need to understand not just 
the potential outcome or reaction to an element of their design, but the 
“why” behind it. We often see feedback in the form of things like, “I 
think the button is better than the link” or “Nobody is going to click 
that.” Or, even worse, “This is terrible…”
This type of feedback typically comes from the reactive form of feed­
back discussed in Chapter 1. It lacks the critical thinking that makes it 
possible for those working on the design to understand what they might 
need to change in their next iteration. For these critiques to become 
valuable, they need to be followed by an explanation as to “why” the 
giver is having that reaction or foresees a certain outcome. For example, 
“Nobody is going to click on that because the current page design leads 
the eye down the left side of the screen away from the call-to-action.”

 2. What Critique Looks Like   |  25
Good critique is actionable. When the “why” behind the feedback is 
included, the designer can fully understand the comment and take 
action. That is to say that the designer has enough of an understand­
ing of what is and isn’t working and why it isn’t working that she can 
explore alternatives or make other adjustments.
Be aware though that this is different from prescription or direction. 
Critique should not tell the designer how to act on something or spe­
cifically what changes she should make (the directive form of feed­
back). Good critique avoids problem solving because it can detract and 
distract from the analytical focus of the discussion. For more on this, 
check out the section “The Rules of Critique” in Chapter 5.
Preferential
Another common characteristic of bad critique is feedback that is jus­
tified by the giver from purely preferential thinking. We’ve all heard 
horror stories about this kind of feedback. Designs are torn apart not 
because a particular aspect isn’t working toward its objective, but 
rather because it doesn’t match exactly what the critique giver “likes.” 
For example, a website design is discarded because the color scheme 
reminds a stakeholder of a Christmas sweater his ex-wife gave him.
It might seem ridiculous, but this kind of feedback is common, though 
maybe not always so extreme. It usually feels like it’s coming out of 
nowhere and has no relevance to the work we’re doing, but sometimes, 
it really just boils down to a personal preference.
This kind of feedback is not only unhelpful—it does nothing to analyze 
a design with regard to objectives—but it can also be distracting and 
counterproductive. This is especially the case when it comes from team 
members or stakeholders who are in a position of approval. In these 
situations, the team begins, consciously or subconsciously, to prioritize 
that individual’s tastes alongside or above project and user goals, even 
if they conflict.
BEST PRACTICES FOR GIVING CRITIQUE
Whereas critique with the wrong intent (done knowingly or not) is 
harmful and can damage teams, processes, and most important the 
product, useful, productive critique has the ability to strengthen

26  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
relationships and collaboration, improve productivity, and lead to bet­
ter designs. To give the best critique possible, think about the following 
best practices when giving feedback.
Lead with questions
Get more information to base your feedback on and show an interest 
in their thinking.
Chances are, before being asked for your feedback, the presenter will 
give a brief explanation of what he has put together so far and how it 
would work. This gives you some context and understanding of the 
objectives he has and the elements of the design he has put in place to 
achieve them. But he likely hasn’t explained everything. Actually, as 
we’ll talk about later on, hopefully he hasn’t explained everything.
This is your chance to open up the dialogue. By asking questions you 
give yourself more information on which to base your analysis and 
give stronger, actionable feedback. If done in a noninterrogative way, 
it shows the designer that you’re genuinely interested in not only his 
work, but the thinking behind it, which can make discussing it and lis­
tening to feedback easier for him.
Examples of questions you might ask:
•	 Can you tell me more about what your objectives were for [specific 
aspect or element of the design]?
•	 What other options did you consider for [aspect/element]?
•	 Why did you choose this approach for [aspect/element]?
•	 Were there any influencers or constraints that affected your 
choices?
Remember though, the dual purpose of asking these questions of the 
designer:
•	 To get more information 
•	 To make the designer more comfortable talking about his thought 
process and decisions

 2. What Critique Looks Like   |  27
How you ask these questions can have a huge impact. Asking every 
question beginning with “Why…” can feel abrasive or like an attack. 
Use lighter, more inviting phrasing such as, “Tell me more about…”
Use a filter
Hold on to your initial reactions, investigate them, and discuss them in 
the proper context, as appropriate.
You’re going to have reactions. As the work is being presented to you, 
there will be things that make you think “Huh?” or “That’s cool,” or 
“I don’t get it,” or maybe something worse. Hold on to those reactions 
and remember that they don’t typically make for useful feedback. Ask 
yourself why you’re reacting in that way. Ask the presenters additional 
questions if necessary to help you understand your reaction.
After you understand your reaction and what caused it, think about 
when it makes the most sense to discuss that reaction and to what 
length. Does it relate to the objectives of the product, the audience for 
it, or any particular best practices that should be followed? Or, is it 
more about your personal preference or wishes for how you’d like to 
have seen it designed?
If your feedback is related to the product’s objectives or best practices 
and not about your personal reaction or preferences, it likely has a place 
in the conversation. Sometimes, though, you might find yourself with 
feedback that, although not a best practice or preference, is also not 
specific to a best practice or a stated objective. Maybe it’s something 
new that you think should be considered. What should you do in those 
situations?
In these cases, it might still be useful to bring your feedback into the 
conversation. These kinds of thoughts can be useful in determin­
ing additional objectives or constraints for the project that need to be 
exposed. It might be something you can discuss quickly and then con­
tinue on with the critique, or it might prove to be something sizeable 
that needs a separate, dedicated discussion so that the critique isn’t 
derailed.

28  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Don’t assume
Find out the thinking or constraints behind choices.
“To assume makes an ass out of you and me.” Most of us have proba­
bly heard that line a few times in our lives. It’s one of the favorites of 
Adam’s father and it has stuck with him.
Making assumptions can be one of the worst things to do during a 
critique. When we make assumptions we begin to form our thoughts, 
questions, and statements around them, without ever knowing whether 
they’re accurate. Before you know it, the participants of the discussion 
leave to work on their action items based on very different ideas and 
produce work that doesn’t align with that of the other participants.
When you make assumptions in a critique about what an objective or 
constraint might be, or maybe that there were no constraints and the 
designer could have done anything, you begin to offer feedback that 
could be less useful because it isn’t based on the real situation.
Avoiding assumptions is simple: ask about them.
Yup. Ask yet more questions. Put your assumption out there and ask if 
it’s accurate. If it is, continue on with your insights. If it isn’t, you might 
need to adjust your thinking a little.
For example, if your feedback is based on the assumption that the 
designer had no constraints and could have done anything, ask him 
if he faced any constraints that influenced his choices. Or perhaps ask 
him if he had wanted to take a different approach but couldn’t due to a 
constraint.
Don’t invite yourself
Get in touch and ask to talk about the design.
In the previous section, we noted untimely feedback as one of the types 
of unhelpful critique. If the recipient of the critique isn’t of a mindset 
or isn’t ready to listen to the feedback and use it, chances are she will 
ignore it or the critique could potentially cause a rift in your working 
relationship.

 2. What Critique Looks Like   |  29
If you have thoughts about someone’s design and she hasn’t explic­
itly asked for your feedback or critique, get in touch with her first and 
let her know. Politely suggest that when she’s at a point when your 
thoughts might be helpful, you’d be happy to share them. Give her the 
opportunity to prepare to listen.
Talk about strengths
Critique isn’t just about what’s not working.
We sometimes have a tendency to focus on negatives, the things that 
cause us problems, get in our way, and that we’d like to see changed. 
We often take the positive for granted. In our project meetings and 
design discussions it’s often no different. We spend the vast major­
ity of time talking about what isn’t working. But that can be harmful. 
Remember that critique is about honest analysis. It should be balanced, 
focusing on the design and its objectives, regardless of their success. 
It’s just as important to talk about what is working and why as it is to 
talk about what isn’t working.
Often when talking about the role of “positive feedback” in critique, 
we see discussions center on the importance of discussing strengths 
as a mechanism for making critical feedback easier for the receiver to 
take. There is a common structure often discussed called the “OREO” 
or “sandwich” method in which you begin by offering a positive piece 
of feedback, followed by a negative one, followed by another positive 
one. It’s a fairly common technique, and you can read more about in 
Chapter 6.
But there are other reasons for making sure that critiques include dis­
cussion on what aspects of the design are working toward objectives 
and why and how.
Part of the design process involves the deconstruction and abstraction 
of ideas and then recombining them in different ways or with ideas 
from somewhere else. It’s a common way in which we take a familiar 
concept for which there is room for improvement or added value and 
then innovate from there. When we talk about aspects of a product or 
design that are working, there is the potential for the designer to exam­
ine those areas and abstract concepts or elements from them that could 
be used to strengthen other areas of the design that might not be work­
ing as well.

30  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Additionally, with the understanding that the designer(s) will iterate 
upon his design after a critique, how bad would it be if at the next cri­
tique you noticed that an aspect of the design that seemed great pre­
viously had now been changed and wasn’t quite as effective. And this 
happened because it hadn’t been talked about, so the team didn’t see a 
reason not to change it.
Think about perspective
From whose “angle” are you analyzing the design?
In the previous section, we talked about preferential critique, or feed­
back that’s based on personal preferences rather than being tied to 
objectives for what we’re designing. When we’re analyzing a product, 
it can be easy to forget that we most likely aren’t representative of the 
product’s target audience. Even if we are a potential user, we know far 
more about it than the average user.
As you analyze a design, it’s important for you to try to balance your 
expertise against the user’s perspective. It can be difficult to achieve, 
but by simply asking yourself, “How am I looking at this?” when you 
examine an aspect of the design and comparing your perspective to 
what you think the user’s might be, you’re off to a good start. From 
there you might find that one is clearly more appropriate than the other 
(your visceral hatred of the shade of green being used probably doesn’t 
matter), or perhaps it might be best to bring both up in the discussion. 
For example:
From the user’s perspective, I think all of the steps in this flow make 
sense and are understandable and useable. But from an interaction 
design perspective I think there might be some redundancy and 
opportunities to simplify…

Surface-Intended Fidelity and Nail Your Timing
One of my favorite collaborators is a cre-
ative director and graphic designer named 
Chris Cashdollar. Before you ask, yes, that is 
his real name. Chris and I worked for several 
years together at a web design agency called 
Happy Cog, where I served as the experience 
director. I oversaw a small team of experience 
design and content folks, while Chris oversaw 
graphic designers.
Experience design and creative direction 
often overlap in skillsets, process, and pro-
clivities; in some agencies the two aren’t even 
considered separate groups, existing simply 
as “design” (or “Design,” if you’re fancy). During our time working together, 
I approached design discussions by getting at the user’s perspective via a 
solid understanding of interaction design conventions, metrics, and insights 
from research. Chris evaluated design based on a deep conceptual under-
standing of the designer’s intention as it related to choices in graphic direc-
tion. Together, we were a formidable force for great design.
Our collaborative culture was informal. One of my favorite critique sto-
ries occurred during the design of the Zappos website. In looking over a 
designed page, it felt like it was missing an experience that captured the 
delightful nature of the brand. I proposed a tool that suggested shoes based 
on ridiculous combinations of people and occasions such as “I’m a robot 
going to a nightclub.” It resonated well with the designer and eventually 
the client. That culture of openness yielded good ideas like this often, but it 
also lead to clashes and disagreements, especially when feedback was both 
unsolicited and unstructured. That doesn’t help at all. I’ll let Chris tell you 
what that feels like:
Designers get a bad rap as being introverted and sensitive. In the 
midst of an otherwise productive design critique, I’ve seen them 
become sullen and withdrawn—or worse, defensive and angry. Col-
laborative discussions about improving design easily devolve into a 
turf war with camps entrenched in their opinions on direction without 
setting proper expectations.

32  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
The right feedback at the wrong time ruins momentum and causes design-
ers to abandon good thinking. It also invokes stress and negativity into office 
relationships. Designers feel as though their shiny, new Camaro-of-a-design 
just got T-boned while waiting for the light to turn green. Their attention 
(and thus the feedback they were expecting) was elsewhere. That’s why the 
wrong emotions kick in and, unfortunately, the work suffers.
By taking the extra time to converse with a designer prior to a critique, 
you’ll have a common understanding of what is on the table for discussion. 
Are you talking about concept or art direction? How is branding applied? 
Create the appropriate boundaries for the critique so that all parties under-
stand what specific aspect of the work is under scrutiny, and whether it’s 
still developing or a follow-up on something finished.
Creating those boundaries is something Chris and I learned to encourage in 
our teams from years of working together. To prevent those misunderstand-
ings and poorly timed comments, I always ask two simple questions before 
telling anyone what I think. They might seem obvious, but by asking them I 
respect choices that have been made so far, and I open the conversation to 
reach its full potential.
Where are you in your process?
This question reveals a designer’s intended fidelity of thinking. 
Everyone’s design process is different, and in many cases they vary 
from project to project. By understanding where a designer feels like 
he is in his own journey, I can tailor the language in my feedback to 
reflect that. Is something about to go to a client? Then, it’s probably too 
late to revisit larger decisions. Is this early thinking? Then, don’t pick 
on details; look for more interesting conceptual discussion. This ques-
tion usually uncovers the designer’s rationale for key decisions very 
quickly. Knowing the intended fidelity of someone’s work goes a long 
way toward not reacting to something they may have not even consid-
ered yet.
What can I help you with the most?
Gut reactions are going to be informed by experience and expertise, 
but they aren’t going to be organized because they’re shooting out of 
your gut instincts. Asking this question helps me to organize my reac-
tions into something designed to address the designer’s immediate 
stumbling block. Whether the feedback is solicited, asking this ques-
tion gives the conversation a chance to serve a purpose. Opinions are 
easy. Help at the precise time it’s needed is difficult, but not impossible.
Hopefully these two quick and easy questions will help you frame slower, 
more difficult discussions in more meaningful ways.

 2. What Critique Looks Like   |  33
Central Idea
Giving good critique is a skill that begins with the right intentions. Help the 
recipient understand how effective the design is by making sure that you’re 
avoiding selfish, untimely, incomplete, or preferential feedback and by fol-
lowing best practices.
A SIMPLE FRAMEWORK FOR CRITIQUE
It’s helpful to have a sense of what the structure of a good critique 
sounds or looks like. As Chapter 1 instructs, critique contains three 
important details:
•	 It identifies a specific aspect of the idea or a decision in the design 
being analyzed.
•	 It relates that aspect or decision to an objective or best practice.
•	 It describes how and why the aspect or decision works to support 
or not support the objective or best practice.
To ensure that we uncover and include all of these details there is a sim­
ple framework of four questions that we can ask ourselves, or the other 
individuals participating in the critique, as shown in Figure 2-1.
FIGURE 2-1
The four questions that comprise the basic critique framework

34  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
These four questions flow together to generate feedback in the form of 
critique. By asking these questions, we collect the necessary informa­
tion with which we can think critically about the design we’re examin­
ing. Let’s take a look at these questions individually.
What is the objective of the design?
We want to understand what we’re analyzing the design against so 
that we can focus our attention on things that are pertinent to the 
conversation and the improvement and success of the design. Try 
to identify the objectives that the designer was aiming to accom­
plish through the choices she made. What are the objectives of the 
product or design that have been agreed upon by the team? 
What elements of the design are related to the objective?
Next we identify the aspects and elements of the design that we 
believe work toward or against the objective. Whether the aspect or 
element is the result of a conscious choice by the designer doesn’t 
matter. We are analyzing the effectiveness of the whole design as 
it’s presented.
Are those elements effective in achieving the objective?
Now that we are thinking about specific objectives and the aspects 
of the design related to them, it’s time to ask whether we think 
those choices will work to achieve the objective. This is the crux of 
critical thinking.
Why or why not?
Finally, we need to think about the result that we think the choice 
will actually produce. How close is it to the actual objective? Is it 
completely different? Does it work counter to the objective? Maybe 
it won’t work to achieve the objective on its own, but in conjunction 
with other elements of the design it contributes to the objective. 
Note that the first two questions can be reversed in order depending 
on how the design is being presented. These questions form the foun­
dation for the critical thinking that comprises good critique. As such, 
these questions can be asked and answered internally by individu­
als giving feedback, or they can be exposed and asked directly of the 
designer. As mentioned in the earlier section on best practices for giv­
ing critique, it’s great to lead with questions. And questions that ask 
about what choices were made and what objectives those choices were 
intended to achieve are a great way to start the conversation.

 2. What Critique Looks Like   |  35
Other questions to think about
The four framework questions help us formulate feedback that a 
designer can use to better understand the effectiveness of his choices 
when viewed against his objectives. But, what about other aspects of 
the design? What about other questions that come up? For example:
•	 What new problems, complications, or successes might arise from 
the choices being proposed?
•	 What other objectives should the designer have been considering, 
but didn’t?
Raising these kinds of questions can be important. Ignoring them 
might mean missing something that becomes problematic later in the 
project’s timeline, or it might give rise to a new objective for the team to 
discuss and agree to (or discuss and agree isn’t an objective).
With additional questions like these, however, it’s important to keep in 
mind scope—both the scope of the product and the scope of the feed­
back discussion. These questions can lead to spending too much time 
discussing things that are outside the scope of the project or product 
itself, like perhaps a known issue that the product isn’t intended to 
solve. Or, questions like these can take the focus off of the aspects of 
this design for which the presenter is looking for feedback, and instead 
use up valuable time on elements of the design that haven’t been fully 
thought out yet and are likely to change anyway.
The group, both the recipient and the givers, need to be conscious of 
this potential for scope-creep and be prepared to end or defer a discus­
sion when it begins to move out of scope.
About objectives
As we’ve mentioned and will continue to reference throughout the book, 
critique is about analyzing something against its objectives. But what 
exactly are these objectives? In Chapter 3 we’ll describe four aspects 
that we feel establish the objectives of a product: personas, scenarios, 
goals, and principles. These elements frame a product and provide an 
understanding for team members of what they’re trying to create.

36  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Additionally though, when we describe objectives, we should be consid­
ering best practices—heuristics that have been established over time 
to help us understand how best to approach or solve for a given situa­
tion. Ignoring these in a discussion would be detrimental. As you ana­
lyze someone’s work, it’s likely that, if you are well versed in a certain 
set of heuristics, you’ll identify areas of the design that are in or out 
of alignment with those best practices. These observations should be 
included in the discussion. An objective of anything we design should 
be to align with best practices where applicable.
Central Idea
Forming critique is a simple four-step process. What are the design’s objec-
tives? What are the elements of the design related to those objectives? Are 
those elements effective? Why or why not?
Receiving Critique
Listening to people comment on something you’ve created can be scary. 
It can be difficult enough to present something to a group of people, 
never mind the possibility that they then might begin to pick it apart.
While I was in film school, at the end of each year we were required to 
present our final film to an audience of classmates, instructors, family, 
and friends. At the end of my first year, I presented my work, a short 
film that debated who was the better superhero, Batman or Superman 
(the answer is Batman, of course). Following the credits, I walked to 
the front of the room, talked for a few minutes about it and waited for 
the comments.
I didn’t have to wait long.
One of the professors began to tear into it, commenting on how point­
less it was, how little depth it had, how the actors didn’t move enough 
yet were working in a medium called “movies.”
Those 12 minutes still haunt me. And for a very long time after that, 
I was terrified of showing my work—any work. On multiple occa­
sions over the years, that fear became so significant that I threw out 
everything I created. Even when I moved into the business world, the 
www.it-ebooks.info

prospect of standing there and listening to feedback terrified me. And, 
unfortunately, I’ve had numerous encounters with coworkers that have 
reaffirmed that fear.
—ADAM
Many of you might have had similar experiences, or have heard enough 
horror stories that you feel like it’s happened to you, too. All of this fear 
and trepidation can lead us to change our behaviors and expectations 
when presenting our work and asking for feedback.
Just like giving critique, receiving it in a way that is useful and produc­
tive requires the recipient(s) to have the right intentions. When receiv­
ing critique you should be in a mindset to step back from your cre­
ative thinking to examine the choices you’ve made to better understand 
how to proceed and take your design further. And you should value the 
expertise and perspectives of your teammates in doing so.
Often, though, we see individuals and teams go through the process for 
the wrong reasons, leading to issues down the road as the project pro­
gresses, both for the product and the team’s relationships.
CRITIQUE ANTI-PATTERNS
When engaging in critique, there are patterns (or behaviors) that go 
against critique best practices and can hinder the critique process. The 
sections that follow describe these patterns.
Asking for feedback without listening
Sometimes, we ask for feedback because we feel like it’s the right thing 
to do, or because we feel like we have to. Although stepping back and 
forth between creative thinking and analytical thinking is a key compo­
nent of a successful design process, it isn’t the case that we’re always in 
a position mentally or tactically to listen, consider, and utilize feedback 
to improve our designs.
If we ask for feedback or critique, we need to be ready to listen to what­
ever we receive in response. Asking for critique at a time when we don’t 
really want it or can’t do something with it leads to unproductive dis­
cussions. By not listening to our teammates, we miss valuable insights 
that can help improve our designs. The people critiquing our work are

38  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
likely to pick up on your disinterest and, as a result, will feel uninter­
ested in sharing their thoughts. Over time, they’ll be less inclined to 
participate in these kinds of conversations at all.
Remember the importance of being able to switch between creative 
and analytical thought. Getting used to making this switch between 
creative and analytical thinking may not always feel comfortable. But if 
we learn how to use it effectively, by making critiques a scheduled part 
of our process, it can go a long way to strengthening us and our team’s 
skills as designers. For more on formal critiques and the design pro­
cess, see Chapter 4.
Asking for feedback for praise or validation
Creating something can feel awesome. Whether we’re designing alone 
or as part of a team, it’s not unusual to want to be recognized for our cre­
ations. But it should not become our motivation for asking for feedback.
And yet we do it often. We share our work with statements such as 
“Hey! Check out this thing I just made! I’d love your thoughts on it,” 
when really the only thoughts we want to hear are “Way to go! Looks 
awesome!” and “Congratulations!”
So we wait for the cheers. Some come, and it feels great. But then we 
get some feedback about things that aren’t so great or things we could 
have done better, and it hurts. No matter how valid the points might 
be, we might not be in the proper mindset to hear them. Some peo­
ple will become defensive. Others might argue and try to discredit the 
feedback. Some ignore the comments. But either way, we haven’t done 
a very good job at receiving critique, even though you asked for it.

 2. What Critique Looks Like   |  39
Not asking for feedback at all
Because you’re reading this book, and you’ve made it this far in, hope­
fully you understand the value in critique and how it can help you to 
improve your designs and products. If that’s true, then you should also 
see how important it is to seek out critique.
If we don’t take the initiative to ask for critique or feedback in a way 
that helps us understand and improve upon our ideas then we’ll miss 
a huge opportunity. We can’t just assume that others will come to us 
with feedback. And we can’t assume that just because no one comes 
to us that we’ve designed the perfect solution. By bringing others in 
to help us analyze our ideas we can take advantage of their experience 
and expertise to inform our design decisions in ways we aren’t able to 
do on our own.
Central Idea
Ask for feedback, and when you do, be ready to listen and act on what you 
learn.
BEST PRACTICES FOR RECEIVING CRITIQUE
Receiving critique in a way that is productive goes beyond just asking 
for it and then sitting back to let others give you their thoughts. When 
receiving critique, keep in mind the best practices that follow.
Remember the purpose
Critique is about understanding and improvement, not judgment.

40  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
There is no such thing as a perfect solution. There is always room for 
improvement. A goal of a critique is to help identify where those oppor­
tunities are. The conversations we have during critique act as road-
signs along the evolution of our ideas and designs, helping us to under­
stand which paths might take us closer to our end goals. Critique isn’t 
about pass or fail, approval or rejection. It is a reflection used to inform 
a next step.
Listen and think before responding
Many of us have a bad habit of not really listening when someone is 
speaking to us. We hear the first few words they say, and then instead 
of listening to the remainder of what they’re saying, we begin to formu­
late a response and wait for the first opportunity to start talking.
What this means is that while the person we should be paying atten­
tion to is explaining a thought, instead of listening to and processing 
that explanation we’ve essentially ignored it. It’s not that we’ve done 
so maliciously; this is a common occurrence and most of us do it. 
Obviously though, this is counterproductive to what we’re trying to do 
in a critique.
When receiving critique it’s important that we work toward preventing 
any natural tendencies to form rebuttals and instead focus on listen­
ing to people’s entire thoughts. This doesn’t mean that as the recipient 
we must sit silently throughout the critique. Figure 2-2 shows that—
after listening to a piece of feedback—the responses we give should be 
intended to ensure that we understand what the critic is trying to tell 
us. We can ask what the critic means. We can answer his questions. We 
can provide more details about how we came to the decisions in our 
designs if it’s necessary to help the critic with his analysis.
Return to the foundation
As people share their thoughts with you, you might encounter feedback 
that seems out of place. It might seem as though the feedback has little 
to do with what you’re trying to design or the objectives you have. The 
person you’re hearing from might just be having difficulty connecting 
her thoughts, or it may be that she has begun to offer feedback that is 
based more on her own preferences or goals.

FIGURE 2-2

the recipient to seek clarification and ask questions in order to make sure they 
understand what is being said
To help you determine this, you can use previously agreed-upon objec­
tives. A product’s objectives describe the reasons for its creation, who it 
is for, and what it will do (more on this in Chapter 3). If you can’t deter­
mine for yourself how the feedback relates to the product or project’s 
objectives, try to work with the person giving the critique on relating it 
back by asking her follow-up questions related to the objectives.

42  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
If, over time, you’re able to determine a connection, you’ll better under­
stand the feedback and can use it moving forward. If not, you might 
have discovered that members of the team share different views on 
what the objectives of the product and its design are.
Having a mutually understood foundation or set of objectives is import­
ant not just to critique but also to the success of the product and the 
team. If you discover during a critique that different perspectives about 
objectives exist within the team, the best course of action is to point it 
out explicitly. You can then, depending on its severity and the people 
present, determine if the conversation should change focus to address­
ing and resolving the difference right then, or if it should be tabled for 
a separate conversation in the near future.
Participate
One of the best things a designer can do during a critique is to become 
a critic themselves. Being able to shift our mindset from thinking cre­
atively to being analytical about what we’re designing is a key design 
skill. Participating in a critique of our own work as a critic has multiple 
benefits.
First, the more we exercise intentionally switching our mindset like 
this the easier it becomes to control this mindset “toggle.” Switching 
from creative thinking to analytical will be easier, faster, and some­
thing we can do whenever we feel like it’s helpful, whether we do it by 
ourselves alone at our desks, or we grab the person sitting next to us 
for their thoughts, or we schedule a meeting to collect critique from a 
larger group.
Second, one of the common challenges people have with giving cri­
tique is a fear of hurting the designer’s feelings. By participating in the 
analysis and openly talking about the aspects of our design that could 
be improved upon, we can make others feel more comfortable partici­
pating in these discussions.
Third, by modeling the behavior and the form of critique, we demon­
strate to the other participants how to give feedback in a way that is 
helpful to us, making it easier to collect useful critique and facilitate 
the conversation.

 2. What Critique Looks Like   |  43
Central Idea
Critique isn’t about judgment. It’s about analyzing the design so that you 
can improve it. Participate in that analysis. Listen to the feedback you collect 
from others and relate it to the objectives of the product you’re designing. 
Critique, Conversation, and Questions
Good critiques—that is, critiques that are productive for the entire 
team—are the result of dialogue. The giver and receiver request and 
exchange information back and forth, and from those exchanges come 
useful, actionable insights. In a productive critique, there are often a lot 
of questions asked by both parties.
In fact, great critiques are often more about questions asked than state­
ments made. Questions being asked means that assumptions can be 
validated, eliminated, or further examined collaboratively. This means 
that the feedback being collected is based upon a mutually understood 
foundation rather than each individual’s different interpretations. It’s 
also useful for the recipient to pay attention to the questions being 
asked because they can be signs as to what elements of the design 
might be unclear or confusing to others.
This should also tell you something about how best to ask for feedback 
and which communication platforms make the most sense. It’s com­
mon for designers or teams to send their designs to other members 
of the team via email and ask for feedback. It’s also common for these 
kinds of exchanges to become problematic.
Email isn’t a great conduit for anything resembling real-time conver­
sations. It isn’t designed to work that way, but being able to quickly 
ask questions and get back responses that may assist in advancing 
your thinking, spur additional questions, or provide insights is cru­
cial. When dealing with multiple people giving feedback, these defi­
ciencies become even more pronounced, because now you need to 
manage threads, keep track of who gets what information via replies 
and reply-alls, and so on. We’ve all likely experienced situations in 
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

44  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
which feedback was originally solicited by email, and after one or two 
replies, a conference call or in-person meeting was set up because it 
just seemed easier than trying to make sense of the lists of questions 
and comments coming back.
Online feedback tools like inVision and others do their best to try to 
work around this by making it possible for people to comment on 
specific aspects of a design and keeping those threads together. This 
works better, but the non-real-time nature can still prove challenging,  
because in order to give comments, individuals must do so based on 
assumptions that they haven’t yet been able to validate or eliminate.
That isn’t to say that critique isn’t possible through these mecha­
nisms. It very much is, but, if we’re going to use tools like this, perhaps 
because we’re in a situation for which we have no other choice, we need 
to ensure that we’re doing our best to make them as conversational and 
focused as possible.
When requesting feedback through a mechanism like this, be specific 
about what you want feedback on in your request. Specify what the 
objectives for your product or design were. Allow for as many questions 
back and forth as you can. When making assumptions in order to offer 
an insight, be sure to state that assumption so that the recipient can see 
it and verify that it’s true or let you know that it isn’t.
It takes more work and can often take a bit longer, but it can be done. 
We do recommend that, when you can, it’s best to use a platform in 
which everyone can communicate in real time and look at the design 
together. With some good facilitation (see Chapter 5) you’ll find that in 
sessions like this, whether they’re in person or through a conferencing 
tool like WebEx or Google Hangouts, you’ll do much better at collecting 
useful feedback, keeping the team synchronized, and building a sense 
of collaboration.

Wrapping Up
Good critique begins with both the giver and recipient having the right 
intentions: wanting to understand whether the elements of the design 
will work towards the objectives of the product.
Following are the characteristics that make feedback unhelpful:
•	 It’s driven from personal goals.
•	 It’s untimely.
•	 It’s incomplete.
•	 It’s based on preference.
To help ensure your feedback is useful and works toward improving the 
product, you should do the following:
•	 Lead with questions. Get more information to base your feedback 
on and show an interest in their thinking.
•	 Use a filter. Hold on to your initial reactions, investigate them, and 
discuss them in the proper context, as appropriate.
•	 Don’t assume. Determine the thinking or constraints behind 
choices.
•	 Don’t invite yourself. Get in touch and ask to talk about the design.
•	 Talk about strengths. Critique isn’t just about what’s not working.
•	 Think about perspective. From whose “angle” are you analyzing 
the design?
Similarly, when asking for feedback, be sure that you aren’t do the 
following:
•	 Asking with no intention of listening
•	 Asking when you’re really just looking for validation or praise

46  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
When asking for critique, keep the following in mind:
•	 Remember the purpose. Critique is about understanding and 
improvement, not judgment.
•	 Listen and think before responding. Do you understand what the 
critics are saying and why?
•	 Return to the foundation. Use agreed-upon objectives as a tool to 
make sure feedback stays focused on objectives.
•	 Participate. Critique the work alongside everyone else.
If we understand the best practices for giving and receiving critique, we 
also notice a few things about how we collect feedback through various 
platforms. The more we’re able to facilitate real-time question-and-an­
swer sessions across the group, the better the exchange is likely to be. 
This is why in-person meetings and videoconferencing tend to be best. 
However, we can still use feedback tools and email; they just take more 
planning and careful facilitation.

Culture and Critique
Creating a Conducive Organizational Culture
An organization or team’s culture has a huge influence on how critique 
is incorporated and whether it will be effective. Even if members of a 
team understand what critique is and have a good grasp of the best 
practices for giving and receiving it, there are aspects of the culture in 
which they work that can create obstacles to communication and limit 
the usefulness and utility of critique.
People, locations, procedures, and more all shape the cultures in 
which we work. When trying to change any aspect of how people work 
together within a team, it’s important to examine the culture and envi­
ronment of that team. If you can identify the cultural and environmen­
tal aspects that enable or hinder the changes you’re trying to make, 
you have a much better chance at identifying suitable approaches and 
opportunities for making the changes you’re after.
In examining these characteristics with regard to integrating critique, 
it helps to remember that for the most part when we talk about cri­
tique we’re talking about a form of communication between two or 
more people. With that in mind, it makes sense that the characteris­
tics we’re most interested in are those that affect who is involved in the 
communication, what they’re communicating about, and when they’re 
communicating.
Organizational politics, territorialism, and influence are significant 
and common cultural aspects that influence these things, and we’ll 
get to them in a bit. But as Aaron and I have worked with teams to 
help them strengthen their communication skills, we’ve observed that 
two of the most important characteristics of team cultures that indi­
cate whether and where critique will be effective are collaboration and 
iteration.

COLLABORATION: MORE THAN JUST “WORKING TOGETHER”
Understanding a team’s beliefs and approach to collaboration helps us 
understand with whom critique is most likely to be easy or challeng­
ing. Strong facilitation skills can help steer feedback and conversations 
toward critique—this is an important skill in any organization—but if 
we want to know who our “critique champions” might be, or the people 
we might need to throw our best facilitation techniques at, we need to 
think about how people collaborate and what their attitudes are toward 
it.
Collaboration itself has a pretty basic definition. Merriam-Webster 
defines it thus: “to work with another person or group in order to 
achieve or do something.”1 But those of us who have spent some time 
collaborating with others on projects know that it isn’t quite that simple.
When we examine how people collaborate, we find that there are two 
primary mechanisms at work, coordination and consensus. Around each 
of these we sometimes see extreme versions of collaboration. Teams 
or individuals that collaborate in these extreme manners tend to pres­
ent challenges to critique, whereas those that understand the balance 
between the two do much better.
COORDINATION
Coordination is the act of aligning individual work efforts to produce 
outcomes that will eventually be assembled into or utilized in the for­
mation of an end product. In these cases, either the individuals are 
directing their own work or they might be receiving direction from 
someone else, perhaps a product owner. But that direction and the 
work done as a result of it is done without much input from or con­
sideration of what others who are working on additional aspects of the 
solution are doing.
Collaboration at this extreme can be challenging to the integration of 
critique; if this is how the team members feel they should be collaborat­
ing, it’s likely they’re uncomfortable and/or inexperienced sharing their 
perspectives on the work of others or having others share perspectives

on their own work. These teams or organizations are often separated 
into silos and have established processes and values that insulate them 
from one another.
CONSENSUS
On perhaps the other end of the spectrum, we can find collaboration 
that is contingent entirely on consensus. In these extremes, teams 
don’t do anything unless everyone (or nearly everyone) agrees that it’s 
the right thing to do.
Collaboration of this sort can be challenging for critique, because cri­
tique isn’t intended to get everyone to agree. Critique is a useful tool 
for helping to ensure that teams stay focused on what matters most in 
a project and not getting mired in personal preference. Along those 
lines, it can help show where there is partial consensus. But its purpose 
and intention isn’t to make everyone agree.
In critiques, people will disagree. Individual perspectives will produce 
different lines of thinking, and that’s OK. If a team feels it needs com­
plete consensus to move forward, a critique won’t in any way guarantee 
that.
MEETING IN THE MIDDLE
The best approaches to collaboration, and by extension those that best 
support critique, are those that understand that throughout a project, 
there is a shifting balance between the two mechanisms of coordina­
tion and consensus. Leadership—yes, that’s still important in collabo­
ration—looks to understand where consensus lies and uses that (but 
not without still considering any divergent perspectives that might be 
present) as a basis upon which to make decisions. Also, when appropri­
ate, individuals or groups are able to work in a more coordinated man­
ner to allow for improved efficiency.
In this regard, culturally, members of teams where critique fits easiest 
are those that exhibit the following:
•	 A belief that they should offer their perspectives (when appropri­
ate) on what will or will not work for the design the team is creat­
ing, even outside of their own skillset or expertise
•	 A trust that their perspectives will be taken into consideration 
by whomever is responsible for the aspect of the design being 
discussed

•	 The understanding that although their perspective will be taken 
into consideration, a different direction or decision might be made 
based on the consideration of other perspectives and relevant 
expertise and, of course, the objectives of the product
When in a situation that involves their design or an aspect of the design 
they are responsible for being critiqued, these team members will 
receive and utilize critique from others such that the preceding three 
points are supported.
Incremental Versus Iterative Processes: 
What They Mean and Why They Matter
If a team’s collaborative spirit helps us to understand how its culture 
will influence who is involved in critiques and how we critique with 
them, its approach to incremental and iterative processes helps us under­
stand their culture’s influence on what they can best critique and when.
Incremental and iterative are adjectives used to describe common 
design and development processes. As methodologies such as Agile 
and Lean have become more and more popular, use and discussion of 
these adjectives has also increased and it’s not uncommon for teams 
to misunderstand or confuse them. Both describe a sequentially based 
approach to achieving a desired end state for a product, but they employ 
different means.
INCREMENTAL DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
Incremental design and development describes a primarily additive 
approach to reaching an end state (see Figure 3-1). In an incremen­
tal approach, an ultimate solution to the given problem is identified 
and broken apart into pieces. The time needed to reach the solution’s 
end state—when all of the pieces have been created and assembled 
together—is divided into phases.
During each phase, a new piece is created and connected to the pieces 
created in the previous phases. The previously constructed pieces are 
not modified outside of what is necessary to attach the new piece(s). As 
a result, the complete creation at the end of any phase is just a collec­
tion of all the pieces built so far. Each can still be identified individually 
because they’ve changed very little since their original creation.

FIGURE 3-1
An illustration of incremental design and development if it were applied to a 
pocket knife
Examples of incremental design, like that depicted in Figure 3-1, feel 
a bit odd, because teams don’t typically release or reveal the product at 
each intermediate phase. Instead, they wait until the end when all the 
parts have been assembled.
Another, more well-known example would be to look at organizations 
working on various products within the same ecosystem. For example, 
Apple has been working toward a vision of controlling the home/per­
sonal media ecosystem. With each new product, iPod, iTunes, Apple 
TV, countless apps, watches, and so on, the company has moved incre­
mentally closer and closer toward that vision.
In an incremental process, how closely our final creation matches what 
we had originally intended depends heavily on our ability to think 
ahead as we build each piece. More important, the effectiveness of our 
final solution is dependent on how deep our understanding of the prob­
lem was when we initially conceived of it.
The rationalization of an incremental approach is that, for most cre­
ations, it is too complex and inefficient to try to build the entire solution 
at once. So, breaking things apart to design and build them in phases 
makes more sense. The common criticism of incremental approaches 
is that they require teams to make decisions about what will be created 
while there are still too many unknowns. Teams must make too many 
assumptions and base decisions on guesses as to how effective their 
solutions might be.

52  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
ITERATIVE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
Iterative design and development on the other hand recognizes that initial 
solutions are not likely to be completely effective and therefore the goal 
is to repeatedly modify a solution to gradually increase its effectiveness.
In this way, iterative approaches can be seen as a recombinatory 
approach to reaching a final product. With a purely iterative approach, 
again the timeline is divided into phases, often called iterations. A team 
begins by creating its best attempt at a solution, noting where it is mak­
ing assumptions. As a solution is created, it is then analyzed to assess 
its effectiveness, preferably through some interaction with actual users.
Assumptions are either confirmed or disproved. The team now has an 
updated, more fully formed understanding not just of the effectiveness 
of its solution but also of the problem(s) that it’s trying to solve. It then 
modifies the solution based on this new knowledge. With each itera­
tion, the solution becomes increasingly more effective.
Examples of iterative processes most resemble evolution. Over time 
unnecessary or ineffective elements of a product are removed or 
replaced with new, more fitting or effective elements. For example, con­
sider Figure 3-2, which illustrates the evolution of the telephone from 
its original design to the cell phone handsets that were around just 
before smartphones came into being. While these manifestations of 
the phone are spread out over time and not the result of a single team, 
they can be seen as iterations on a solution for the objective.

PROCESSES IN REALITY
In real life, our processes aren’t purely incremental or purely iterative. 
It would be impossible for teams to outright ignore new insights and 
understandings they gain during a project as they would in a pure 
incremental approach.
And, a pure iterative approach doesn’t allow for teams to break solu­
tions apart into the smaller manageable pieces they need to be able to 
deliver something.
An effective design and development process is both incremental and 
iterative. It allows for pieces of a solution to be prioritized and created 
at different times. Sometimes, those pieces might be identified early in 
the process but scheduled to be worked on later, as part of a roadmap. 
Or, sometimes they may come up spontaneously as part of the analysis 
during iteration.
Additionally, as an iterative approach allows for the solution to be mod­
ified with each iteration, new pieces aren’t just “bolted on.” The overall 
solution can be changed to incorporate the new pieces in a way that 
is consistent and makes sense. By combining incremental and itera­
tive approaches, we can work toward a vision while providing repeated 
opportunities to assess whether our vision is appropriate, learn about 
the effectiveness of our choices, and modify those choices and our 
vision, as necessary.
A great example of a combined iterative and incremental process is the 
creation of this very book. Aaron and I started with a vision, an out­
line, of what we wanted to create. We then began to write various chap­
ters, building out the book incrementally. At the same time, though, 
both within each chapter and with the book as a whole, we iterated. We 
revised sections and chapters and we reorganized things to fit better 
together, eliminating some sections and discovering a need for some 
that weren’t part of our original vision.
WHY IT MATTERS
So, what do iterative and incremental processes have to do with critique?
Of these two approaches to process, you might guess that iteration is 
most important to critique, and you’d be right. But just as an effective 
process will include both iteration and incrementalism, effective cri­
tiques will benefit from the same sort of hybrid approach.

54  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
For critique to take place, a process must allow for iteration. This is 
essential, and it’s why iteration is such an important aspect of organi­
zational culture. The team’s process needs to provide it time to analyze 
and rethink decisions and change what it designed in the places where 
it determines the designs won’t be effective. Iteration and critique go 
hand in hand. Critique is a linchpin for iteration. It lets us know how 
and where to iterate, keeping you on the right track to meeting the 
objectives of our products.
More than just an allowance by process, the culture of a team must be 
one that supports and promotes iteration. This means that both indi­
vidually and as a group, participants need to be comfortable with the 
idea that what they are analyzing (or what they are presenting to be 
analyzed) and what will be created as a result of their analysis is only 
temporary. It provides an opportunity for further analysis and learn­
ing, which can then be used to improve the product. Team members 
need to value continuous improvement over “right-the-first-time,” and 
they need to be working in a process and culture that accommodates 
and reinforces that value.
If critique is so tied into iteration, why does the incremental process 
matter? It matters for the same reason that it does in the design and 
development process: focus. The problems we’re trying to solve, or the 
solutions we’re trying to design are often too big to try to discuss, never 
mind produce, all at once. We need to break them apart and focus on 
individual pieces at different times. Otherwise, a critique, or any con­
versation for that matter, can fragment into so many directions that it 
loses all value.
Central Idea
The cultures that are most conducive to good critique value collabora-
tion and iteration. They understand that for teams to make good decisions 
together, critical thinking is necessary, and that to accommodate critique 
and continuous improvement, iteration must be supported.

ORGANIZATIONAL POLITICS, TERRITORIALISM, AND INFLUENCE
Examining both of the previously noted cultural aspects further, in 
particular the attitudes and behaviors of individuals related to them, 
can begin to touch upon the uglier sides of organizational culture that 
many of us know and often loathe. Politics, territorialism, and influ­
ence based upon position and organizational hierarchy can have a huge 
impact on critique and communication as a whole.
Politics and social taboos influence how we communicate with one 
another and can create barriers to critique. Team members can with­
hold valuable insights due to intimidation by other team members and 
leaders, or for fear of being labeled negatively. If team members repeat­
edly have been told “no” in the past, they might not feel as though their 
insights are valued and therefore not contribute. It is our job to work 
past these cultural barriers and help team members and clients con­
tribute in a positive way.
I once worked at a company where product design teams were com­
peting with one another, vying for resources and funding for their 
projects. This created a very political culture in which teams were not 
focusing on what was best for the company and products but were 
instead concentrating on getting recognition for themselves, even at 
the expense of others. Secrecy and combativeness were common in 
meetings and critiques.
I sat in critiques during which managers gave harsh criticisms on work 
that another manager’s team had done because it was getting more 
attention than their projects, or because that manager had said some­
thing negative that affected them in the past. This not only created 
an environment in which collaboration was sparse and communication 
was fragmented, but it discouraged team members from participating 
in critiques.
—AARON
Bringing about change in politically charged and territorial cultures 
like this can be difficult, but it can be done. Observation is our ally. 
Notice who the positive contributors are and establish relationships 
with them. Positive contributors are those team members who have 
the product’s (and its users’) best interest at heart and will be advo­
cates for better processes that lead to positive results for the product. 
We can work with them using the tools we have to establish a solid

foundation for critique and communication (see the section “Setting 
the Foundation for Critique” coming up shortly) to build toward more 
objective-focused conversations. When the focus is on the product and 
its objectives, and not on individual agendas, it becomes easier to culti­
vate a healthy environment for critique.
This is not a walk in the park. You need to work toward an established 
(and realistic) goal and be prepared to accept incremental change.
Setting the Foundation for Critique
To help ensure that we are integrating critique to the best of our abil­
ity, we need to work at building a culture in which the conversations 
surrounding design are productive. When working to change culture, 
whether it’s to make it more conducive to critique or to achieve any kind 
of shift, it’s important to know that there aren’t big, quick solutions.
Culture is pervasive. Not only is it the shared values and behaviors of 
a group, it’s also directly reinforced by the group’s actions and behav­
iors. This chicken-or-egg scenario makes culture change difficult to do 
in large waves. Instead, it’s important to identify and implement small 
changes that have lasting effect.
One such change is in the establishment of a shared foundation for 
any project. In the organizations Aaron and I have found that are most 
effective in their communication and critique, we’ve seen that all of 
them begin their projects by explicitly identifying the objectives of the 
project to a significant degree of detail. It seems completely logical, but 
you’d be surprised at how many teams we’ve encountered that when 
we’ve asked them what the objectives are of the product their design­
ing, very few people are able to answer, and those who do rarely answer 
with the same objectives.
LACK OF FOUNDATION
Conversations that happen during the design process can often go awry 
because the participants all have varying ideas, visions, and goals in 
mind. The framing of dialogues and discussions for each team mem­
ber is then different because they’re working toward a different set of 
objectives from the others.
Have you ever attended a meeting in which it seems like everyone 
has their own agenda or concept of the direction in which the prod­
uct should be going, but none of them really line up? Or perhaps in

the meeting it seemed like everyone was talking about the same thing 
and left with their to-do’s, but when you reconvened, it was clear by the 
work everyone had done that they had a very different idea of what had 
been discussed?
This environment has a huge influence on critique because all of the 
members are working toward their own individual ideas of where the 
product should go or how it should be built. If teams in these situations 
do try to critique, it’s often ineffective because the objectives each par­
ticipant is critiquing against are different.
I recall attending a meeting during which we were reviewing some 
design work, and the feedback from almost every individual on the 
team was different. One product owner thought a feature should be 
changed to make an internal team work more efficiently, an execu­
tive wanted to make changes to the feature so that there would be 
less development work, and a designer wanted to take what they were 
building in a direction that they thought was innovative. Each individ­
ual had valid points, but each point was being pursued separate of 
the other. There was no foundation set that tied all of these insights 
together, nothing to turn to as a North Star to prioritize things and 
guide the conversation and ensure that we stayed on the right path.
—AARON
Different perspectives among team members aren’t a bad thing. It’s 
why we work in teams—to harness a wider array of insights and exper­
tise. But, there needs to be some level setting, a foundation that com­
prises common goals and a shared understanding. When everyone 
is on the same page, the unique experience, vision, and goals of each 
team member can work in harmony for the good of the process and 
ultimately the product.
CREATING AN EFFECTIVE, COMMON FOUNDATION
What goes into a solid foundation? What kinds of things should teams 
work toward agreeing on before diving into the design?
There are four common and widely used tools: personas, scenarios, 
goals and principles, that when put together, create a solid foundation. 
These tools help us guide our conversations a provide points of refer­
ence to keep everyone on the same page throughout the process.

58  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
When Aaron and I talk about the objectives of a project or product, it 
is typically these 4 things that we are referring to. The objectives for a 
product are to:
•	 Reach its goals...
•	 For the given audiences (personas)...
•	 By creating a design with the right behaviors and characteristics 
(principles)...
•	 To produce the desired experience when used in the applicable con­
texts (scenarios).
The background: personas and scenarios
Personas and scenarios provide the “setting” for the analysis? How are 
we going to look at the design? Through whose eyes? With what behav­
iors or expectations? In what contexts?
Personas are user archetypes that describe an individual’s behaviors, 
goals, expectations, knowledge, and so on (see Figure 3-3). There are 
lots of opinions on the depth and details to include in personas; our 
preference is to use half-page, succinct personas that list main points 
(with elaborations as appropriate) that can be referenced at a glance as 
opposed to deeper, narrative-style personas.
A word of caution regarding personas: stay focused on what matters 
and be explicit. Many teams get carried away including details that 
don’t matter, aren’t helpful, or aren’t explicit enough. For example, is it 
really important to include that your persona has two dogs and enjoys 
spending his Saturdays in the park? What does that tell the team? Don’t 
use flowery stories or superfluous details to hint at characteristics or 
behaviors, state them explicitly.
Similarly, don’t get hung up on demographics. Demographics are often 
used as stereotypes for behaviors and characteristics. For example, 
persona Steph is a millennial; therefore, she must be great with 
technology. That’s not necessarily true. Aaron and I know quite a few 
millennials who are absolutely clueless about technology. Just as we 
know many people over the age of 60, a demographic often assumed 
to be technology-challenged, who are far better than Adam with 
computers, and his degree is in computer science.

FIGURE 3-3
An example of a persona used in a project for the creation of a new 
knowledge-sharing platform
The point is, learn the real characteristics of your audience and state 
them explicitly in your personas to help minimize any confusion or 
misunderstandings as they’re referenced throughout the project.
Scenarios are short narratives that describe the contexts in which your 
product will be used and the experience people have when using it 
(see Figure 3-4). Scenarios aren’t limited to include only what the user 
does, or what the product does. They aim to capture the full experience 
including an individual’s thought process and emotions.
Similar to personas, it’s not uncommon for teams to become caught up 
in the fun of storytelling when writing scenarios. Base your scenarios 
on real observations. Be sure that the details you include matter. When 
you include a thought, emotion, or reaction that the user might have 
while using your product, make sure it’s something meaningful that 
you intend for your design to either address or produce.

In the design community it’s common to hear or use phrases like “I/
You are not the user.” But, this can be hard for people to remember; cli­
ents and professionals with other areas of expertise—hey, sometimes

By setting up solid personas and scenarios at the beginning of your 
project (hopefully based on research) you give yourself and your team a 
starting point to help guide your critique and analysis.

Personas Help Visual Design Discussions, Too
Most people are familiar with the idea of 
using personas and scenarios for interaction 
design, but they don’t realize how effective 
these tools can be in discussing visual design. 
Several years ago, I was coaching a team 
of two interaction designers and a visual 
designer working on an enterprise software 
product. As the visual designer began transforming sketches into pixels, the 
interaction designers would look over his shoulder and ask him to change 
specific things about the color, type, or layout. When he disagreed, they 
tried to use a persona as a sort of trump card: “Trust us, we did the user 
research.” The designer felt disrespected because his peers weren’t listen-
ing and, even worse, were trying to art direct his work. At the same time, the 
two interaction designers were frustrated because they felt he was making 
design choices based on his own preferences and then getting defensive 
about them. Trust and respect were quickly eroding.
As it turns out, designers can get just as stuck on their personal opinions 
as anyone else. This is especially true if they don’t use the same evalua-
tion criteria for a design solution. Teams sometimes think evaluation criteria 
are “shared” as long as they’re written down somewhere or mentioned in 
a meeting. It’s not that easy. Evaluation criteria are not truly shared unless 
everyone both understands them and believes in them. In this anecdote, the 
visual designer had limited involvement in both the user research and the 
scenario development. This is sometimes necessary from a budget stand-
point, but his teammates could have done more to get him involved.
Shared criteria are especially difficult to develop for the emotionally expres-
sive aspects of a solution, such as the visual or physical styling of a product, 
because it simply feels so much more subjective than something like work-
flow. People also struggle when they don’t have the language for describing 
problems with the design. This is why the interaction designers fell back on 
trying to dictate solutions: they just didn’t know how else to express them-
selves. On the other side, frustrated feedback recipients are less inclined to 
tease out exactly what the real (and often valid) concern is.

62  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
The visual designer was juggling two projects and couldn’t spend much 
more time with the interaction designers, but a few simple communication 
approaches helped the team get along while making the most of everyone’s 
expertise.
Use emotional goals to drive visual style and voice
Like real humans, effective personas have not only practical goals about 
what they want to accomplish, but also goals about how they want to 
feel (in general and at particular points in their journeys). Using these 
to both guide and evaluate the visual style turned the team’s discus-
sion from personal preference to whether orange-and-lime-green or a 
casual typeface would really inspire enough confidence in the product. 
And by the way, this works for the tone of your copy, too.
Use scenarios to articulate visual hierarchy needs
The interaction designers were mostly concerned about visual hierar-
chy—what was emphasized and de-emphasized on the screen—but they 
didn’t have the right language to express themselves. The next time 
they reviewed a set of scenario storyboards with the visual designer, I 
asked them to discuss several things. Who’s the most important per-
sona for this scenario? What’s the first thing that persona should see 
or notice on the screen? What should the persona notice after that? 
Which things on the screen should the persona notice only by excep-
tion, or when more detail becomes necessary? This helped the visual 
designer get the visual hierarchy right the first time.
Keep asking: which persona, which scenario, which goal?
After the first two approaches restored enough good will, the team 
members were ready to listen to one another again. When someone 
offered a solution instead of a concern, his colleagues would ask ques-
tions like, which persona or scenario are you thinking about? When you 
say this style isn’t working, what seems contrary to which emotional 
goal? This let the team agree on the problem, so everyone felt heard 
and respected.
It’s tempting to use personas and goals like hammers to end argu-
ments, but this can backfire if the other person isn’t fully invested in 
the personas, or you haven’t fully understood their concern. Personas 
are much more effective when used as tools to clarify understanding 
and as conversational shorthand for complex needs and behaviors.

The end game: goals and principles
If personas and scenarios are the starting point, goals and principles 
are the finish line. Goals and principles describe where you’re trying to 
go with the design; they outline the future you’re trying to create and 
ways in which you want to create it. For whatever aspect of a design 
you’re critiquing, you can ask of them, “Does this help us reach our 
goal of…” or “Does this adhere to the principle of _____ that we set?” 
followed by “How?” and “Why?”
Goals are the desired, measurable outcomes that result from the prod­
uct being used. Figure 3-5 demonstrates how they help capture the dif­
ference between the current world and the future world.
FIGURE 3-5
Example goals for a new knowledge-sharing platform
The team should feel that the goals set forth are achievable and mean­
ingful and that they should correlate to a change in user behavior. It’s 
also best to avoid goals that are binary or output based. For example, a 
goal of adding a “remember me” feature to a login screen is about out­
put. It’s binary in that the team either produces it or it doesn’t. A better 
goal would be “increase authenticated visits to our site by 15 percent.”
Principles are the qualities and characteristics that the product will 
exhibit in its content, behavior, and so on as people use it and interact 
with it, as shown in Figure 3-6.

64  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Good principles should be somewhat specific. Characteristics like 
“fun” or “amusing” don’t make great design principles because they’re 
still pretty broad. Every member of a team might have a different inter­
pretation of what “fun” is.
Good principles also act as constraints and filtering mechanisms for 
detailed design ideas. By virtue of being specific, a good design prin­
ciple helps you to eliminate more design ideas than you retain from 
idea-generation activities such as brainstorms, which allows you to 
focus your efforts as you move forward.
Similar to personas and scenarios, if your team knows the goals and 
principles, if it understands and agrees to them, goals and principles 
act as a tool to keep your critiques on track. With them, you can keep 
the discussion focused on learning things that will help you iteratively 
improve your design and move closer to achieving the desired end state.
It’s important to ensure that your team understands all of the foun­
dational elements you’re addressing. This way, when comments come 
up in a critique that feel like they’re based on a personal preference, or 
something outside the foundation you’re designing for, you can refer 
back to the applicable personas/scenarios/goals/principles and scenar­
ios and ask how the comment relates to them.
If it does, great! That means that people are still critiquing from the 
foundation you set.
If not, you can move the critique along to the next comment. Or, per­
haps you need to discuss whether the comment really matters and 
should be factored into the design. It is possible to miss something 
when establishing a foundation. Moreover, new information can come 
up during the course of a project that can change the importance of 
foundational elements or even reveal new ones. But by starting your 
project with them, you have a basis for discussing whether these com­
ments indicate that something might be missing.
MAKING IT LAST: THE MINI CREATIVE BRIEF
The foundation starts your project off on the right foot, but its real 
effectiveness in changing process and culture lies in carrying it 
through into discussions throughout the project. It’s a colossal waste 
when teams spend tons of time at the beginning of a project crafting

goals, scenarios, and so on and then two months later, when they’re in 
the heat of design, no one can remember the last time anyone actually 
looked at or talked about a persona or other key foundational objective.
A great tool for keeping the foundation in front of the team throughout 
the project is a Mini Creative Brief. Maybe you haven’t experienced this, 
but almost every creative brief we have come across is the opposite of 
“brief.” As such, it’s pretty quickly discarded, because referring to it is 
painful.
We first learned of this technique from Jared Spool, the founder of User 
Interface Engineering (UIE), who in turn was introduced to it by one 
of his clients. The idea behind the Mini Creative Brief is to capture the 
most important foundational elements and objectives for the product 
on a single page or less. Using the foundational elements above, a Mini 
Creative Brief would include the following:
•	 A brief summary of the problem statement or purpose of the 
product
•	 The key users (personas) of the solution
•	 The main scenarios in which the solution will be used
•	 The business goals that have been established for the product
•	 The design principles to be followed
Keep in mind that this is a mini brief, so it is not necessary that we have 
the full documentation of these items; instead, they should be high-
level lists and summaries that convey keep points to the team.
As you are starting meetings or having discussions about designs, take 
a few minutes to review the Mini Creative Brief with the team. This 
acts as a reminder and focusing mechanism so that conversations are 
centered and everyone is on the same page. The team at UIE even goes 
so far as to have someone different read the Mini Creative Brief aloud at 
the beginning of each meeting to ensure that the information is being 
read by people from across the team, not just a project lead or designer. 
You can read more about the Mini Creative Brief on the UIE blog at

Central Idea
Keeping critiques focused on what matters for the product means having 
a mutually understood set of objectives. By working to uncover what these 
are and referencing them regularly throughout a project we not only have 
better critiques, but we begin to change the culture and dynamics of a team 
to better support critique.
PUTTING THESE TOOLS TO USE
All of these tools are your allies. Center your conversations on them 
and use them to build a foundation for stronger critiques. As you cre­
ate and gather these tools, be sure that you not only share them with 
your team, but also keep them posted and accessible in shared repos­
itories such as Dropbox or a wiki. Consider putting them up on walls 
in a shared workspace if you can; this will help increase their visibility 
to the team. There’s truth to the cliché, “Out of sight, out of mind.” So, 
make an effort to keep these things in sight and, more important, in 
conversation.
Personal Barriers to Critique
Even with a supportive culture and a good foundation in place, there 
are other obstacles that can hinder our ability to integrate critique. 
Individuals on their own have a number of factors that affect how they 
communicate with one another and whether they might have difficulty 
with critique or not.
ADDITIONAL CULTURAL INFLUENCES
Outside of organizational culture, the societal and ethnic cultures that 
an individual is a part of affect how they communicate in team set­
tings. For example, many of us are raised to abide by the principle, “If 
you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.” There 
are many people who, not wanting to hurt someone’s feelings during 
a critique session, hold back from delivering honest critique that they 
worry might upset the recipient. Or worse, they validate ideas even if 
they think it isn’t the right direction. Being honest can be difficult, but 
it’s also essential to good critique.

 3. Culture and Critique   |  67
In some cultures challenging or speaking up is seen as rude, whereas 
other cultures are more open, straightforward, and abrupt. These kinds 
of differences can lead to misunderstandings. People might sense that 
others who are more used to being straightforward are actually being 
combative. Or participants might think that people who tend to refrain 
from sharing disagreement in groups are in agreement.
Respect and trust are tantamount to good critique. We need to con­
sider these influences when preparing for critiques and, if necessary, 
communicate to those who will be participating that it is perfectly 
acceptable for them to step outside of these “norms.” We should ensure 
that everyone knows that when sharing thoughts and insights during 
the critique, it is not a reflection on the designer(s) skills or expertise; 
rather, it is part of the process of analyzing whether what we are work­
ing on is on track to reach the goals we set for it. It is safe to say that 
if someone shares thoughts that your design is not working in some 
way or another, you are probably still a good person. Critique is about 
understanding and improvement, not judgment.
It’s not only our societal mores that affect what we share; the language 
differences that are part of our cultures can cause obstacles, too.
I’ll never forget the first time I worked with a team from India. About 
a month into the project, the team came to our offices to work with us 
onsite. All of the team members were wonderful people, but after our 
meetings, I kept finding out that we weren’t as aligned as I had thought 
we were during the meetings, or that where I thought there had been 
disagreement there actually wasn’t any. It turned out that I misread 
some of their body language; what I thought meant one thing, actually 
meant something different to them.
—ADAM
Different cultures and regions sometimes use words or gestures to 
mean different things. These kinds of gaps in communication can 
become apparent in team communication and critique, so it’s import­
ant to try to identify and clarify them as soon as they’re noticed.

NEGATIVE CRITIQUE EXPERIENCES
In the same way that an individual’s societal, ethnic, and cultural influ­
ences can affect how he communicates with teams and clients in a cri­
tique setting, any past experiences with critique can also affect how 
one participates in sessions.
Putting your work out there for other people to analyze or comment 
on is intimidating enough in and of itself, but if you have had nega­
tive experiences with it in the past that sense of intimidation is height­
ened. We have all heard horror stories from designers who were taught 
to have “thick skin” by professors in college who used “critique” as an 
opportunity to break them down, which reminds me of a story that a 
designer told me recently while we were discussing critique.
I was in RISD Graphic Design. On our first project we had to design 
a form. Not a lot of setup, we had a few hours. I thought I’d make 
my form slanted up to the right—like how people actually write. We 
are all instructed to tape them on the wall. The teacher (a well-known 
designer) walks straight up to mine, tears it off the wall, throws it on 
the floor, and stomps on it, all the while saying absolutely nothing.
I was too embarrassed to say anything.
—DORELLE RABINOWITZ
Although we understand the need for having thick skin as a designer, 
this is surely not the way to teach it.
Critique should be a safe, collaborative environment, in which teams 
can discuss their designs among themselves, with clients, and with 
others within their organizations. We can help create this environment 
by setting certain rules for critiques (these are discussed at greater 
length in Chapter 5) and ensuring that everyone is aware of them.
FOSTERING THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE
Not everyone communicates in the same way—there are actually peo­
ple who are not good at communicating at all. Communication is a vital 
component to critique and when communication is off, the chances of 
having productive critiques are minimal at best.

 3. Culture and Critique   |  69
It would be silly to think that we must improve everyone’s ability to 
communicate before starting our critiques; if that were the case, we 
might never start. Teammates’ communication skills will improve as 
they grow better at critiquing, and we can help them. To begin, observe 
them, clients, and business partners to see how they communicate, and 
then see what they respond to positively and negatively. We can then 
use these insights to help structure our communication with them as 
well as use them to improve the way we facilitate our critiques.
As we continue to learn and understand how various team members 
communicate we can begin to plan how we want to use our tools for 
facilitating critique with team members who communicate in different 
ways. We may need to approach those who might be difficult or tend to 
dominate discussions in a one-on-one setting and share our ideas for 
how critique should work. Setting expectations up front is helpful in 
avoiding conflict during the critique session.
Adam and I have also found it helpful to approach those within the 
team who communicate well and share the vision for how we would 
like to see critique work. As they understand the value, they can help in 
communicating that value to the rest of the team as well as be a support 
during the critique session. Going it alone is not easy, so find advocates 
and allies.
We shared some helpful tools earlier in this chapter. Don’t hesitate to 
distribute these to your teammates before the critiques happen so that 
they can review them and ask any questions. The conversation about 
what we are critiquing should begin before the actual meeting. Share 
the rules and process that you want to establish for your critique ses­
sions (see Chapter 4 for a more in-depth explanation of the rules for 
critique) so teammates can know what to expect going in. 
By providing your teammates with a framework for how to you want 
to communicate insights and ask questions during the critique, you 
provide them the opportunity to work past communication issues and 
contribute effectively.

Central Idea
An individual’s own history, culture, and capabilities influence her ability to 
critique effectively with others and her attitudes toward it. If you truly value 
critique and collaboration, you should take measures to work with individ-
uals, identify and address communication gaps, and ensure that they feel 
safe in sharing their work and perspectives.
Practicing Critique
As we’ve described, changing aspects of culture is not a once-and-done 
endeavor. Any effective approach requires longevity and reinforcement. 
And as with any skill, the act of practice, whether intentional or not, is 
critical to improvement.
By finding as many opportunities to critique, no matter how formal or 
informal, you not only improve people’s critiquing skills, you also build 
an awareness of critique and make it a more natural component of your 
team’s conversations—effectively changing the culture.
We suggest that you start small, working with one or two others to get 
used to having dialogues about your designs. Do this as often as you 
can so that you can get comfortable in a critique setting and work up to 
larger groups from there.
One tactic to help get your team comfortable and adjusted to how cri­
tique differs from other feedback is to critique competitor’s designs; 
this is not only helpful with respect to competitive analysis, but it also 
provides a forum in which the team can practice the critique process.
I had a design director with whom I worked closely, and at the end 
of every day, we would set aside some time to talk about the work we 
did that day and to offer each other critique. This helped us become 
comfortable discussing our work with each other and, more important, 
become comfortable with someone critiquing our work. Every so often 
we would include our product manager and even developers, helping 
us to get used to multiple points of view.
In the end, it really does come down to practice, practice, practice, and 
then after that, practice some more. Some things will work, others 
won’t; the more you practice critiquing with your team, the more you

will begin to understand what will work best. Much of what we are 
sharing in the book we learned through trial and error, eventually get­
ting to what worked best. 
Central Idea
Critique is a skill. It must be practiced. Don’t expect it to be perfect the first 
time you try it. Find as many opportunities as you can to do it, and over 
time, things will get better as you go.
Critiquing with Distributed Teams and Remote 
Team Members
Telecommuting and geographically separated teams are a reality and 
becoming more and more common. Sadly, many people still view them 
as a kiss-of-death to any hope of good collaboration or communication. 
But collaboration is a mindset, not a by-product of co-location. So long 
as that mindset is present, with a few tricks and the right tools, remote 
team members can contribute to a critique just as well as the teammate 
sitting in the room with us.
Both Aaron and I work remotely. The product design team that Aaron 
works with has a mixture of co-located and distributed team mem­
bers spread out across different company and home offices. They have 
a very collaborative structure and design process with design studio 
and critique at the center. Nothing is ever as fun as being in the same 
room with someone, but when that is not an option, the quality of col­
laborative activities and critiques does not need to suffer. They have 
equally effective critique sessions with team members both in-office 
and remotely. It really comes down to having a shared understanding of 
critique’s importance in the process and the mindset to make it work.
The first challenge to overcome in remote arrangements is the lack of 
nonverbal communication that we get with the ever-popular phone or 
conference call. Hearing someone’s voice lets us know what someone is 
saying, but we miss so much of the information that comes from see­
ing the person say it. The solution to this is pretty easy: video chat. This 
technology goes a long way toward giving us the nonverbal information

72  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
we need as we collaborate. With it, we can see facial expressions, ges­
tures, posture, all the things we would pick up if you were in the same 
room with the individual.
Screen sharing makes it possible for us to focus a group’s attention on 
a single artifact or visual, something very important to collaborative 
activities. In a critique, we can share documents in a format such as 
PDF and then, using Adobe Acrobat, add comments directly on the 
pages using the commenting feature. Or we can use a program such 
as InVision with which we can share and comment as we talk through 
designs with our teams.
For instances in which we need more freeform visualizing and captur­
ing of ideas, like the kind of freedom we get from a nice clean white­
board, a fresh pack of dry erase markers, and a pile of sticky note pads, 
try using tools such as BoardThing, StormBoard, and document cam­
eras (we like iPevo’s) in conjunction with screen sharing. Document 
cameras are webcams that are built for sharing documents and live 
transcription or note-taking, similar to the overhead projectors some of 
us are familiar with from elementary school. With them, we can sketch 
and annotate in real time with teammates, or share sketches that we 
have previously worked on.
There are many other tools available for remote collaboration, and more 
being released almost daily. Because of the reality that many coworkers 
aren’t actually co-located, and the growing interest in telecommuting, 
many companies are looking to make collaborating from separate loca­
tions as much like being in the same room as possible.
More important than the tools we use, however, is our approach. For 
remote collaboration to work, the individuals involved have to want to 
make it work. They have to believe in the importance of collaboration, 
be conscious of the differences being remote poses, and address them 
together. So long as our team is dedicated to making critique and col­
laboration work in remote settings, we will find a way.

Hallway Conversations Without the Hallways
When I switched to full-time remote work, 
I knew the lack of chats in the kitchen and 
nods in the hall would leave me longing for 
human connection. So, I added a book club 
and some dinner gatherings to my life outside 
of work, and I expected things to be more or 
less under control.
What I didn’t realize, however, was how important those inadvertent inter-
actions with coworkers were to feeling comfortable both giving and receiv-
ing critique.
Suddenly, nearly all of my time with coworkers was spent in design reviews 
or status meetings. By its very nature, critique reminds us of the things we 
haven’t yet done. And so, though the “no’s” and “not yets” were helping me 
create better designs, they were also more prominent in my mind than the 
occasional reminders that I was a valued and welcome part of the team.
It had a terrible effect on my psyche. My inner critic ran rampant. “This 
can’t be the most efficient way of doing it.” “You’re not as productive as 
so-and-so.” At its worst, it declared, “They’ll figure out you swindled them 
into hiring you!” Because I had little idea of what my coworkers’ pace or 
methods were, I believed her. I couldn’t see any evidence contrary to my 
inner critic’s accusations.
My crumbling self-confidence meant that I was less and less likely to offer 
my insights to peers and that their critique felt more and more about my 
worth instead of about my designs.
Later, after I started a project where I was regularly collaborating with a 
small team, I found out that similar thoughts occurred to them during their 
remote work life. Rather than sliding into the bathrobe-wearing slovenly 
person so many conjure when they imagine remote work, we were each 
turning into paranoid workaholics. The culprit was our insufficient trust 
building outside of critique.
The discovery from our commiseration gave me the courage to consciously 
pursue connection with my team. Here are some tactics that have helped 
me:

Waste some meeting time
Spend a few minutes at the beginning or the end of a meeting having 
hallway conversations without the hallway. Pairing conversation with 
critique reminds us that we’re all on the same team.
Broadcast a little
Allow coworkers to “notice” your homemade curry lunch or your new 
paper prototyping kit through whatever shared communication your 
team has, such as Twitter, Slack, or IRC. Discovering similarities with 
coworkers builds connection.
Bond individually
Swap stories and catch up during video chat lunches. They’re even eas-
ier to schedule than in-person lunches, and one on one time strength-
ens bonds.
Perfect your remote walk-by
Asking for spontaneous critique is the most difficult to adapt to remote 
work. A quick “Got a minute?” instant message is a good place to start. 
Be sure to jump on a voice or video call when you need it.
Practicing a mix of these tactics and others enabled me to improve the trust 
we felt as a team. That trust builds the foundation required for productive 
critique.
Whatever you do, give yourself permission to experiment. Getting it right in 
the remote world will take some work, and you and your team are worth it.
Central Idea
While remote and telecommuting arrangements pose challenges to collab-
oration and critique, remember that collaboration is a mindset, not a result 
of co-location. If team members value collaboration, with tools like video 
chat and screen sharing, remote collaboration and critique sessions can be 
just as effective as they are in person.

Wrapping Up
Collaboration and iteration are key elements in organizational cultures 
where critique is successful. Cultures that best support critique are 
those that value collaboration and iteration.
Other aspects of organizational culture, such as politics and territorial­
ism, also influence a team’s ability to critique. To counter these aspects 
and work to change the culture we can set a foundation for our projects 
that consists of personas, scenarios, goals, and principles.
Collecting these foundational elements and referring to them regularly 
through a tool such as a Mini Creative Brief helps to keep conversations 
focused on what’s important.
Additional obstacles to critique can arise from each individual’s own 
experiences and culture. To address these, do the following:
•	 Set expectations up front. Let people know that they are expected 
to be honest and share their perspectives.
•	 If you need to, reaching out to those who you know will be partic­
ipating to gauge their previous critique experiences will help in 
identifying any members with whom you might need to have addi­
tional conversations in preparation for critiques.
•	 Be on the lookout for differences in understanding. Sometimes, 
it isn’t immediately obvious that they’re happening. Often, people 
think they’re talking about the same thing only to find out later 
they had completely different interpretations.
Working remotely offers some additional challenges to collaboration 
and, by extension, critique. But there are many tools available today, 
and more being released all the time that help overcome these chal­
lenges. Video chat, screen sharing, digital whiteboards, and document 
cameras go a long way to providing the capabilities we need to critique 
effectively when we can’t be in the same space.
Change doesn’t happen overnight. It will take some time to get it right, 
so set reasonable goals for yourself and your team and practice, practice, 
practice. Repetition and reinforcement are crucial to changing culture.

Making Critique a Part 
of Your Process
Creating Opportunities for Critique
Critique is an analysis tool that we use for the purposes of evolving and 
improving something. At any point during our projects—when we’re 
looking to take what we have created so far and analyze it in order to 
make it better by revising choices we might have made—we have an 
opportunity for critique.
As Aaron and I have worked with organizations to see how they are or 
aren’t using critique, we’ve found three common points in processes 
during which feedback is often collected. These points offer some 
interesting opportunities and considerations for critique.
Standalone critiques
Meetings or discussions held for the sole purposed of critiquing 
something
Collaborative activities
Events in which multiple people work together simultaneously to 
solve a specific challenge
Design reviews
A common event in organizations’ project and design processes
Things to Keep in Mind
We’ll discuss each of the above forms in more depth later in this chap­
ter, but before we do, it’s important to call out some considerations that 
you should keep in mind as any team works to incorporate critique 
into their process or improve upon the way you might already be using 
critique.

78  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
START SMALL
The number of people involved has a direct effect on how much effort 
it takes to manage a conversation, both from a facilitation standpoint as 
well as an individual participant’s ability to follow along.
When introducing critique or working on improving an organization’s 
skills with it, it’s good to keep the number of people involved to fewer 
at first, maybe just pairs. This minimizes the mental acrobatics that 
participants need to do to keep track of everyone’s feedback and gives 
them the ability to focus a bit more on the critique itself and their own 
skills within it. As people grow more comfortable, you can introduce 
increasingly larger groups.
THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK
Listening plays a huge role in critique, for both recipients and those 
giving the feedback. It’s been beaten into many of us that there is a 
difference between listening and hearing. That difference can become 
very clear in conversations, particularly discussions that include or are 
focused on feedback.
Hearing is a passive act. It’s something that we just do. And even 
though it takes no real effort for us “hear” something, it can still pro­
duce a response. At any given moment, we’re likely to be hearing a 
variety of things, some influencing our actions and some not, all with 
little to no conscious recognition of what we’re hearing actually is or 
means. We still react to what we hear, but these reactions are typically 
impulsive and automatic. Does that sound like anything we’ve already 
discussed?
Listening, on the other hand, requires focus. When we listen, we take 
in information through what we’re hearing and consciously interpret it 
to form an understanding that directs how we behave. This process is 
a deliberate one that we’re aware of as it is happening. We’re conscious 
of the questions being asked in our brain to make sense of what we’ve 
heard and we’re focusing our energy on getting to that interpretation.
Although both hearing and listening can lead to changes in action and 
both rely on some form of attention, it’s this deliberate focus and con­
scious awareness that separates listening from hearing. To make sure 
our feedback discussions stay focused on pertinent, useful feedback, 
www.it-ebooks.info

 4. Making Critique a Part of Your Process   |  79
we need to ensure that we’ve actually listened to and understood what 
has been said before we say something in response. Whether you are 
giving or receiving critique, listening plays a critical role.
THINK ABOUT WHO TO INCLUDE
When working on an organization’s critique skills, it’s important to 
give some consideration to which individuals you bring into the conver­
sations, given that each participant can either help or hinder the oth­
ers. This in no way means that we should start excluding everyone who 
might be struggling. It’s more that we need to think about how and 
why we put people together in critiques whose purpose is to maximize 
the potential for improving the skills of the group overall.
OK. With all that now out of the way, let’s talk about process. Or, more 
specifically, the ways critique can fit into it.
Central Idea
Regardless of how and when you incorporate critique, be intentional. Think 
about who should be included. Keep groups small when first introducing 
critique. And always, listen and think before you speak.
Standalone Critiques
Standalone critiques are nothing more than meetings or discussions 
with the single purpose of critiquing a creation so that it can be iter­
ated upon further. This form makes it possible for us to critique pretty 
much anything we need analysis on, at any time. Because of that flexi­
bility they often provide us with the ability to gather more targeted and 
focused feedback on specific areas of our designs than we would if we 
wait and try to incorporate feedback into other project meetings.
At a previous job, my director and I would chat at the end of every 
day to discuss the work we did, how we felt about it, and provide each 
other with feedback. On one particular project, we had a tight deadline 
and a lot of ambiguity surrounding the website we needed to design. 
Because we met at the end of each day for critique, we were able to 
talk through our design decisions and help each other measure those 
decisions against our goals. The more we met, the better we became 
at asking questions about each other’s work as well as uncovering 
www.it-ebooks.info

80  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
questions to ask the product team so we could get the information we 
felt was lost in ambiguity. After the project, we continued meeting at 
the end of each day, and once or twice a week, we included a product 
manager to help build a shared understanding.
This was very helpful to both of us because we became very comfort­
able giving and receiving feedback and it also helped us improve our 
presentation and communication skills when discussing designs. It also 
didn’t hurt that a nice cold beer often accompanied these standalone 
critiques.
—AARON
Standalone critiques are also very effective when we’re introducing cri­
tique to someone who isn’t familiar with the process or when a team is 
working to practice and improve its critique skills. Because the entire 
purpose of these meetings is to critique something, we can organize 
them so that they provide a safe, controlled place in which participants 
can share and analyze work while getting comfortable with giving and 
receiving feedback. This is especially helpful when we’re working with 
teammates who might be intimidated by receiving or giving feedback, 
possibly because they have had negative experiences with it in the past. It 
truly is awesome to watch someone come out of his shell as he improves 
his ability to communicate ideas and designs to others, receive feedback 
on his work, and use that feedback to strengthen his creations.
Continuous Critique
“Team critique” likely sets a nice visual—a lot 
of people gathered in a semicircle around a 
wall adorned with beautiful designs. Inevitably, 
someone is pointing at a particular design, while 
others hover back a bit with furrowed brows and 
questions on the tips of their tongues. It looks 
like a fun scenario to get to be a part of!
The reality that I’ve seen has been just a little bit different. I’ve frequently 
worked on distributed teams across multiple time zones and locations. The 
physicality of gathering together isn’t always feasible for a variety of reasons. 
Factor in multiple projects and timelines, other administrative and work-re-
lated tasks and meetings, and it’s easy to see that getting everyone together 
at the same time can be really challenging.

 4. Making Critique a Part of Your Process   |  81
The other reality is that I’ve witnessed design teams who really desire for cri-
tique to be ingrained into their process, and they want to hear and learn from 
their teammates. I’ve always felt that time zones shouldn’t be a debilitating 
constraint—technology, along with a little bit of flexibility from a team, can 
be useful in getting past many of the obstacles that distributed teams face.
In light of the fact that many of us can’t be in the same place to have that glo-
rious-seeming ideal critique scenario, here’s an approach I’ve worked with to 
get started with a distributed, fairly continuous critique system:
Define rules of critique
The good news is that you’ve got a great book in your possession that 
provides you with all of the information that you need to do this.
Choose critique teams
If you have a team of five people or fewer, you can lead the team in 
one-on-one critique sessions. If your team comprises six or more, you 
can share those duties with another member of your team. Consider 
rotating the role of the person leading critique sessions with some 
regularity to give everyone an opportunity. It’s great to choose teams 
where people don’t work on the same projects or products (if possible) 
and are in different physical locations.
Establish a critique operating rhythm
This can be really simple—30-minute meetings, once a week, with a 
variety of approaches that can extend that into something more broad 
to help vary the types of critique you’re receiving. Here are some exam-
ples of how a 12-week cycle might operate:
•	 One-on-one meetings: 30-minute meetings between the cri-
tique leader and other members of the team.
•	 Group critique meetings: Erica Deahl (www.ericadeahl.
com) suggested that one-on-one critique sessions could be 
improved by adding group critique sessions, as well. Try rotat-
ing weeks between one-on-one meetings and group critique 
meetings to get the benefit from both types of sessions.
•	 All design team meetings: In addition to the group critique 
meetings and the one-on-one meetings, consider a regular 
meeting with everyone across all teams. Allow team mem-
bers to sign up to receive critique, and let everyone par-
ticipate across your entire design practice. Youi could also 
expand this to include developers and/or other disciplines as 
it makes sense.

Repeat this
Your mileage may vary, of course, and you might (and I might, too!) 
find that a different approach works as you implement and gain feed-
back for your team. Use this framework as a way to kick off continuous 
critique for your team, and see where it leads.
By implementing continuous critique with the teams I’ve worked with (a rel-
atively small investment, likely less than five percent of a team’s utilization), 
I’ve seen several benefits, including:
•	 Identifies leaders and leadership in the team; everyone gets an 
opportunity to participate, lead, and offer improvements.
•	 Uncovers growth and training / learning needs; discussions 
across multiple projects and products help identify areas of 
growth needs for the team.
•	 Strengthens critique abilities across the team; it’s being put into 
practice regularly and becomes embedded in the design culture.
•	 Increases distributed team communication, interaction, and 
engagement; team members who might not normally have rea-
sons to interact get to spend time working together.
•	 Improves facilitation and presentation skills; the more we prac-
tice, the better we get at framing the scope of discussions and 
presenting our work.
•	 Improves design across the team; critique gives us opportunities 
to hear and learn from different perspectives and take action that 
makes our designs better.
FORMAL AND INFORMAL CRITIQUES
Standalone critiques themselves can take two forms: they can be for­
mal, such as a scheduled meeting with a time, place, invites, and the 
whole 9 yards, or they can be as simple as asking someone for 10 min­
utes of her time to look over what we are working on—maybe chatting 
with someone over lunch, coffee, or drinks as we share our work and 
what we are trying to accomplish, and asking for her feedback.

Both formal and informal critiques are helpful. To ensure that we get 
the most out of them we need to consider the right type of critique set­
ting for the situation.
Formal critiques provide a dedicated, predictable time, and as such, 
they typically give us an opportunity to collect a wider range of perspec­
tives because we can gather more people.
Informal critiques provide designers with a way to quickly collect feed­
back and get answers to pressing questions so that they can continue 
working on their solutions instead of waiting for a scheduled meeting.
Organizations that have done well at integrating critique use both 
approaches and have constructed an environment in which both are 
not only accepted by team members, but expected.
Pixar, the animation powerhouse, uses a formal critique process as a 
way to analyze and strengthen works in progress while building collab­
oration. The practice, called “Dailies,” is commonly used in television 
and film and is based on reviewing a previous day’s footage to deter­
mine if reshoots and adjustments are needed. Seeing the potential and 
utility of this process, though, Pixar has adapted it such that it can 
improve and iterate on work at any stage, not just captured footage.
On a daily basis, Pixar staff from a variety of roles—whether it’s writ­
ers, storyboard artists, character designers, directors, or whatever—
will convene to examine and critique a work in progress. Making cri­
tique such a routine part of Pixar’s process makes it possible for team 
members to build habits and “muscle memory” around productive 
conversations about their work. It also breaks down silos and provides 
a consistent opportunity to gain insights and perspectives about cre­
ations, allowing for continuous improvement. It’s safe to assume that 
these Dailies are a contributing factor to the great work the Pixar team 
produces.
Whichever approach you choose, it is important to remember that the 
more you participate, the stronger your critique skills will become. As 
we said in Chapter 3, practice, practice, practice!

WHEN SHOULD YOU CRITIQUE?
A question that comes up often in our presentations and workshops is, 
“When should we be critiquing?”
Any time you’re looking to take something you’ve done or created and 
improve upon it, you have an opportunity for critique. Although that’s 
true in general, when we’re talking about the practicalities and logistics 
of team collaboration and project timelines, the real answer becomes a 
bit more nuanced.
When thinking about what needs to be in place to critique an idea in a 
useful manner with respect to the idea itself, two very important con­
siderations come up:
•	 We need to be able to clearly communicate the idea to others.
•	 We need to have the time to process the feedback we receive from 
the critique and use it to iterate on our idea.
Taking these things into consideration, we can place two points related 
to these considerations on a timeline that represents the life or “baked-
ness” of a design, as illustrated in Figure 4-1.

 4. Making Critique a Part of Your Process   |  85
Early critique
The leftmost end of the timeline represents the very first spark of an 
idea. At this point, things are very abstract and our own brains are still 
trying to make sense of the connections between aspects of the ideas 
that are coagulating in our minds. Think of it as the early embryonic 
stage of a baby’s development (note I didn’t say what kind of baby). It’s 
just a lump. We still don’t really know what it might be. Maybe it will 
have two arms, maybe eight. Or maybe it will have wings, and fangs, 
and shoot laser beams from its eyes and… well, you get the idea.
The gist is that at this early stage, we still need to develop our thoughts 
around the solution a bit more. If we tried to share them with others 
so that we could get their critique, we’d likely confuse the heck out 
of them because the idea itself isn’t clear enough even to ourselves at 
this point. As soon as the first person asked us to clarify things, all we 
would be able to answer with is “I don’t know.”
To be able to critique, we first need to have enough of our own clarity 
around the idea so that we can clearly communicate it to others. This 
marks the first point that we can plot on the timeline, as depicted in 
Figure 4-2. Before it, critique is premature. It doesn’t mean that we 
must wait until we’ve figured out every single detail and can thor­
oughly answer any question asked. In fact, at this early stage, there will 
still be a lot of details left to figure out and questions whose answers 
aren’t known. That’s alright.

design”

86  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Later critique
The rightmost side of the timeline represents the fully developed, or 
“fully baked,” solution. At this point, whatever is going to be created 
has been. It’s done. It’s out in the world and it is what it is. Nothing 
more can be done to change it.
Those of us who work in digital products or services or who have any 
understanding of design philosophy recognize that this state is consid­
ered a fallacy. We can always learn from what we’ve created, iterate on 
our ideas, and release a New! Improved! Design!
Thinking in practical terms, specifically those of the design and pro­
duction processes, we know that there is a point at which we have to let 
something go and allow it to be built with whatever details specified 
at that point in time. Then, we wait for the chance to work on it again 
and take it further—the next iteration or phase, if you will. There are 
processes and methodologies such as Lean and Agile that work to min­
imize the time between and maximize the frequency of iterations. But 
that point, that “time to let it go, even if just for a bit” is always there. 
That point is the second point on the timeline (see Figure 4-3); it’s the 
point at which we need to stop iterating for whatever amount of time, 
so that something can actually be produced. Often this point coincides 
with sign-offs, approvals, and design reviews (which we’ll talk about in 
a bit).

Finding the sweet spot
The space between the two points in Figure 4-3 is where critique is 
most immediately useful. Yes, it can be argued that we can still critique 
in the time to the right of the second point (we just need to wait until 
things circle back again before we can do something with the feed­
back). But here we’re thinking about critique that is immediately use­
ful; that is to say, the designer can walk away, think about the insights 
that were shared, and right away begin to iterate on the solution.
Now, the amount of time on either side of and between these two 
points will be highly dependent on any number of factors: the scale 
of the problems you’re trying to solve, the scale of the idea itself, your 
team, your process and methods, and so on. We can’t say that the first 
point comes exactly two days after the idea begins to form and then 
there’s three weeks between when critique is useful and then another 
four days when it isn’t.
Often these points are described in terms of percentages. For exam­
ple, the best time to critique a solution is after it is 20 percent baked 
but before it’s 80 percent baked. These kinds of labels can be useful 
in helping us to think and talk about when critique is useful, but they 
still have the possibility of being taken a bit too literally for our com­
fort. Instead, we think it’s best to understand the dynamics and criteria 
we’ve described here and then use your judgment. In some cases, you’ll 
get to that 20 percent mark very fast—maybe a matter of minutes or 
even seconds. Sometimes, it can take longer.

Integrating Design Critique into the Lean Validation 
Cycle
Within the cyclical, rapid pace of Agile proj-
ects, designs (and designers) can often 
become lost in the race to continue “feed-
ing the Agile beast.” This makes thoughtful 
reflection on the design even more difficult to 
achieve. Perhaps not surprisingly, it is exactly 
in these iterative environments that critique is 
most needed. In a recent engagement, we were helping an enterprise client 
conceive and then launch a new digital subscription business. In the con-
ceptual stages of the project, designs were rough—often produced on noth-
ing more than Sharpies and A4 paper—in an effort to bring alignment and 
team cohesion to the new product vision. Critique was rare; most conver-
sations focused on workflow, customer needs, and integration into existing 
client and customer workflows.
With continued experimentation and testing, the team gained more cer-
tainty about the product’s direction. With increased certainty comes 
increased fidelity. Our designer (the only one on the team at the time) was 
tasked with daily refinements of the interaction design as well as an ever-im-
proving visual design. Week-long iterations, filled with continuous customer 
feedback and cadenced client reviews, allowed little time for design reflec-
tion of critique. Making things more challenging was the small size of our 
team: just four people made up of a product manager, two developers, and 
the designer. Our build/measure/learn cycle was the main source of design 
input.
Although the product features and workflow were improving on a weekly 
basis, there was a strong sense from the team that the design was stagnat-
ing. With engineers writing and refining features, the product manager liais-
ing with client and customers, and the client scrambling to provide content 
on a timely basis, the challenge became pausing long enough for insightful 
design reflection to take place. In addition, we had the incremental challenge 
of integrating this new product into a suite of services and offerings of a cli-
ent brand that had been around for decades. The design couldn’t fall short.

Twelve weeks into this cycle the team realized that without meaningful 
design conversation, the product’s success would be limited to early adopt-
ers and brand loyalists, not the broader new audience the client was seek-
ing. With constant urging from the designer at first and the broader team 
second, the client finally agreed to add a designer. With the addition of 
this new team member, design responsibilities were now split between two 
people, making conversation possible at a tactical level between the two 
practitioners. In addition, this gave both designers the time they needed to 
be more thoughtful in their work and to seek out feedback both internally 
and from the client.
One of the first things to fall by the wayside in Lean validation work is design 
critique. This is natural because the refinement of the design is not essen-
tial if the product ideas are wrong. However, when product ideas, customer 
needs, and solution approaches gain traction, it’s important to remember 
that great design differentiates products and focus needs to be shifted to 
this work. Adequately integrating critique into a Lean or Agile environment 
requires a few things:
Ensure that designers aren’t limited in their ability to seek out critique
Tasking one designer with interaction design, visual design, con-
tent, research, and frontend coding limits that person’s ability to seek 
out and incorporate meaningful feedback into their design work. It’s 
important to add designers on to the team to help distribute workload, 
provide practitioner-level critique, and ensure design details aren’t 
being missed.
Set expectations about when and how frequently critiques will occur
There is a tough balance to maintain between clients who love seeing 
(and can easily react to) design work and the need to validate early 
product ideas. Set client expectations that design critique meetings 
will begin at some point during the project and will become increas-
ingly frequent as features mature and customer feedback increases.
Keep discussions broad at first
Design critique sessions early in the Lean validation process can some-
times prove too tactical yet need to be brought back in as soon as 
product ideas reach a threshold of market validation. Keep critique ses-
sions focused starting initially with a style guide–level critique target-
ing product-wide elements and then digging into tactical critiques that 
look at unique elements and implementations across the product suite.

Agile processes are iterative. Design processes are also iterative. Their 
natural integration is not only inevitable, it’s tailor-made. Just as code is 
reviewed regularly in these processes, design critique must also become 
commonplace. The techniques shared provide a framework for starting the 
Agile critique initiative. As with any process, the recommendations are just 
that, starting points. Pay attention to the unique needs of your organization 
and adjust these frameworks to reflect your industry and culture’s unique 
needs.
HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU CRITIQUE?
Early on in our exploration into critique, Aaron and I were asked by 
an audience member at one of our talks if there is such a thing as “too 
much critique.”
I (Adam), in a bit of zealotry and over-enthusiasm replied, “No. Not at 
all!” And then I went on and on about how critique was the best thing 
to ever happen to modern civilization. Well, not really… but you get the 
picture.
We wish we could find that audience member and apologize.
Having had much more time to work with different teams and organi­
zations as well as listen to the experiences of many, many people, we 
agree that yes, there is absolutely such a thing as too much critique. 
As with timing though, there isn’t a specific number or formula that 
indicates exactly how much is too much. Instead, it’s an innate sense 
or sensitivity that a team or individuals develop over time as their skills 
and comfort with critique improve. It’s the sense that critiques are no 
longer helping or contributing to the momentum of the solution or the 
project; instead, they are possibly inhibiting it.
There might be too much critique when the team begins to sense that 
the amount of advancement between critiques is so small that it makes 
it feel as though progress has stalled. Or, perhaps when critiques are 
just talking in circles and the changes being made as a result of the 
insights collected in those discussions aren’t doing anything to advance 
the design, it might be the case that there is too much critique or it is 
happening too often.

 4. Making Critique a Part of Your Process   |  91
Or relatedly, if members of the team feel that critique—more specifi­
cally formal critiques—are being required so frequently that they can’t 
push the design forward enough between them, there might be too 
much critique.
Additionally, if critiques begin to be seen or used by team members as 
a validation mechanism because there isn’t enough confidence in their 
ideas either by the team or the designer themselves, there might be too 
much critique.
Answering the question of how often to critique is too nebulous to 
take on. Your needs will be different depending on the individuals and 
team. Given the scale of what you’re looking for feedback on, some­
times you’ll want critique very frequently, sometimes not so much. 
With practice, you’ll know when the time is appropriate.
The key is honing that sense of when it’s right and when it’s too much, 
and that only comes with practice. Be flexible. As you try incorporat­
ing critique at various points and times and frequencies, think about 
whether it feels like too much or too little. Talk with other members of 
the team and get their perspectives. Adjust your timing and try some 
more.
WHAT SHOULD YOU CRITIQUE?
Another common question that Aaron and I hear is, “What should 
we be critiquing? Sketches? Wireframes? Visual Design Comps? 
Prototypes?”
The answer is, yes, all those and more.
Anything you want to improve can be critiqued. The documents listed 
above (sketches, wireframes, and so on) are all representations of a solu­
tion. The form of documentation doesn’t matter. If you’re looking to 
iterate and improve the solution, critique it. Going further, it isn’t just 
the design we create for our project that we can critique. We can cri­
tique any and all of the artifacts we create: personas, scenarios, journey 
maps, whatever. We can critique the tools, methodologies, processes, 
and so on that we use. We can critique it all. We really can… Critique. 
All. The. Things.
But what changes when you go from critiquing a wireframe to a visual 
design mockup? Or how about design principles? What’s different 
when you’re critiquing those?

92  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
No matter what you’re critiquing, the framework stays the same. What 
are the objectives? What elements or aspects of the product relate to 
those objectives? Are those aspects or elements effective? Why or why 
not?
What changes when critiquing different artifacts or design elements 
are the objectives against which you’re analyzing. The objectives for 
the product will carry through in critiques of any and all aspects of 
the design, but some will be more pertinent at times, depending on 
what you’re analyzing. For example, the color pallet you choose might 
or might not be relevant to a goal of increasing authenticated visits to 
your website or reducing calls to the support desk.
Different aspects of the design can also have their own unique objec­
tives. Often, we see these in the form of principles and best practices. A 
team might establish principles that are specific to interaction design 
or some specific to visual design. Each of these, in turn, has its own 
best practices that should be considered.
This extends beyond the design to anything else you might critique, 
too. For example, if a team is working on establishing design princi­
ples, what it comes up with could (and should) be critiqued against best 
practices for creating design principles.
So, regardless of what’s being critiqued, the structure of the conversa­
tion doesn’t really change. What does change is that against which the 
object being critiqued is being analyzed.
Central Idea
Standalone critiques, whether they’re formal meetings or casual discus-
sions, are a great way to incorporate critique because of the flexibility they 
offer around when and how teams can use them.
Collaborative Activities
As design practices mature within individuals and organizations, 
collaborative activities are playing a larger role in the process. Often 
referred to as workshops or working sessions, these activities pull 
together multiple people to work on solving a problem simultaneously 
and collectively.

 4. Making Critique a Part of Your Process   |  93
Because of their usefulness as both an iteration driver and as a consen­
sus builder (see Chapter 1), critique can be a powerful activity to incor­
porate into collaborative activities.
ENTER THE BRAINSTORM
One of the most common “activities” in a workshop is the brainstorm. 
The idea behind brainstorms is that, as a group, people can come 
up with more potential solutions to a challenge than if they worked 
individually.
Although it’s a nice idea, we can’t say that we’ve often seen it work out 
that way. Instead, what we commonly see in brainstorms, following a 
presentation of the challenge to be solved, is a period of silence. Then, 
one person proposes an idea. Other participants then begin to analyze 
the idea and discuss why it might or might not work, while the remain­
der of the team is trying to come up with their own ideas. Then, some­
one else proposes a second idea. That idea might be completely new, 
but it’s more than likely that it’s a variation on the previous idea. The 
discussion picks up again, now analyzing both presented ideas, and 
this pattern repeats one or two more times. It’s rare that we’ve seen 
brainstorms executed this way produce more than a handful of unique 
ideas.
The problems with brainstorms as they’re commonly executed are 
many.
Brainstorms lack focus
In many of the brainstorms we’ve observed the challenge to be solved 
has not been adequately defined or broken apart to allow people to come 
up with ideas. Often it can feel like someone on the team encountered a 
problem, determined she couldn’t or shouldn’t solve it on her own, and 
so dropped everything to call everyone together in the hopes that mag­
ically after a few hours they’d have a solution.
Brainstorms lack structure and facilitation
Coordinating the mental processes of a group of individuals isn’t easy, 
but it’s essential to productive collaborative activities. When everyone 
is working in different directions, it can be impossible to resolve ques­
tions and find agreements.

94  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Brainstorms devolve quickly into design-by-committee
Often, because of the limited ideas, lack of structure, and pressure to 
have a solution at the end of the session, brainstorms often shift to a 
goal of getting everyone in a room to say yes to a solution without much 
regard as to whether it’s the right solution.
Now, this doesn’t mean that brainstorms are bad and should be 
avoided. Harnessing the power of a group and the fact that you have 
many minds working on a challenge in order to find as many solutions 
as possible is a worthy and righteous goal. A good idea can come from 
anywhere and the best way to find great ideas is to have lots of ideas.
However, we need to put some thought into how we go about planning 
and running brainstorms. Let’s take a look at a very simple framework 
that can instantly improve the quantity and quality of ideas your team 
conceives.
BUILDING BETTER BRAINSTORMS
Let’s think about the objectives of the average brainstorm. Of course, 
the primary objective is to come up with lots of ideas—as many as pos­
sible. But more often than not, we also have the objective of figuring 
out which one of the ideas the team should pursue. And if we’re doing 
things right that idea should be the one the team feels most works 
toward the goals we’re trying to achieve.
With those objectives in mind, let’s take them one by one.
Generate as many ideas as possible
Why is it that brainstorms often struggle to generate more than a hand­
ful of ideas? The answer is simple, and it’s a phrase we’ve used quite 
a few times already, though not in reference to an obstacle: critical 
thinking.
Critical thinking is the nemesis of creative or generative thinking. 
With critical thinking we’re trying to determine if an idea will or won’t 
do what we want it to. The problem with most brainstorms is that we’re 
not doing anything to prevent participants from thinking critically. So, 
not only are some participants spending their time and energy think­
ing about the ideas that have been presented—meaning they aren’t 
coming up with more ideas—but other participants who might be com­
ing up with ideas aren’t sharing them because as they’re coming up 
with them, they’re analyzing them prematurely. Thus the group that’s

 4. Making Critique a Part of Your Process   |  95
formulating new ideas determines that they aren’t worth mentioning 
and keeps those ideas to themselves. This is exactly what we don’t want 
to happen!
Additionally challenging to coming up with lots of ideas in a brain­
storm is the way in which participants are pushed to interact and dis­
cuss things almost immediately after being presented with the chal­
lenge to be solved. This means that before an individual is even able 
to form his own perspective on the challenge and possible solutions, 
he’s forced to listen to, make sense of, and discuss the perspectives of 
others. It’s pretty hard to come up with ideas when all that’s going on.
To generate lots of ideas, we need to utilize activities that minimize or 
remove the opportunity for critical thinking and give individual par­
ticipants an opportunity to form their own perspective. These kinds of 
activities are called divergent thinking activities. These are activities that 
push participants to consider lots of possibilities without consideration 
of their validity. How do they remove or minimize critical thinking? 
Well, sometimes it’s just a matter of a good facilitator watching out for 
it, but more often than not, these activities involve some kind of time 
limit and a challenge. For example: sketch six to eight ideas for this 
interface in five minutes.
OK. On to our second objective.
Determine which idea to pursue
This one isn’t so difficult. As we mentioned, most brainstorms do 
already do this, just badly. If we began our brainstorm with divergent 
thinking activities, the activities we want to do here are convergent 
thinking activities. These are activities that push participants to com­
pare, contrast, consolidate, and eliminate ideas. This is where partic­
ipants come together to discuss ideas and collaboratively determine 
what to do with them. At the end of this process, by virtue of consoli­
dating and eliminating ideas, we’re left with far fewer solutions than 
we started with.
Which leads us to the final objective.
Ensure that the idea(s) you’re left with are the strongest ones
Consolidating similar ideas only goes so far in shrinking our pool of 
possible solutions. Elimination, or more specifically, deciding which 
ideas not to pursue, is really the key to figuring out what we’re going

96  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
to pursue. Some ideas will be easy to eliminate; they might be cost or 
time prohibitive, or maybe they involve acquiring the magical horn of 
the last purple unicorn from the far-away land of Trilandia. But what 
about the rest?
Voting is a common mechanism used to determine which ideas should 
stay in the fight. Participants vote on the idea or ideas they think are 
strongest. But it’s more than likely that the criteria each participant 
is using for making that decision varies and might or might not have 
much to do with the goals of the project.
Enter critique
By incorporating critique as a precursor to voting or a voting-like activ­
ity, we prime the pump, so to speak. We get participants thinking about 
the ideas that have been presented through the lens of the agreed-upon 
objectives for the product. By way of conversation, we’ve likely already 
begun to see where consensus lies with regard to which ideas are stron­
gest relative to the objectives, even before the vote takes place.
Taken all together, these considerations give us a very simple frame­
work for our brainstorms, which you can see in Figure 4-5:
1.	 Divide your time into two main phases.
2.	 In the first phase, utilize divergent thinking activities with which 
you can generate a large number of possible solutions without con­
cern about their validity or quality.
3.	In the second phase, plan for convergent activities that push partic­
ipants to examine the proposed ideas, looking for ways to catego­
rize, consolidate, and eliminate ideas.
4.	 Incorporate critique as part of the second phase to ensure that 
ideas are being kept or eliminated based on their strengths with 
respect to the product’s objectives.
Central Idea
Critique provides a powerful mechanism to help teams make choices that 
are focused on product objectives during collaborative activities such as 
brainstorms.

AN EXAMPLE: DESIGN STUDIO
Adam and I are big fans of the Design Studio methodology. Design 
Studio is a perfect example of the framework we just mentioned in 
action. The technique itself is based upon architecture, industrial 
design, and some art schools where “studio” is the core component 
of the curriculum. Studio classes follow a basic iterative structure in 
which students are presented with a challenge, asked to generate a 
number of possible solutions, and then present those solutions to the 
instructor and class for critique. Based on that critique, the students 
then go back and refine a subset of their ideas, to be presented and cri­
tiqued again. This pattern repeats until an end solution is determined 
and continually refined.

The methodology was adapted to digital design practices and popular­
ized by Todd Zaki Warfel in many presentations; it is noted in his book, 
Prototyping: A Practitioner’s Guide (Rosenfeld Media, 2009).
Although there are many variations on the methodology, there are a 
few core criteria that remain consistent:
•	 The order of activities within one phase, called a charrette, of a stu­
dio is always sketch > present > critique.
•	 There are at least two charrettes. Three is a more commonly used 
number.
•	 The first charrette is always individuals sketching their own ideas 
for the given challenge. 
Adam and I have been using Design Studio with our teams and clients 
for years now and have had a lot success using it to get teams to collabo­
ratively work to define interfaces for apps, websites, and other products. 
What follows is the setup we’ve developed and refined over the years.
We use a three-charrette model. Each charrette has a set time that 
allows for sketching concepts, presenting them to other participants, 
and receiving critique. Participants are broken up into teams of no 
more than six individuals. If there are not six participants to a team 
that is OK. Ideally, three to six participants works well for the exer­
cises. Teams are constructed so that to the degree possible they are 
cross-functional; that is, we don’t have one team comprised completely 
of designers and one entirely of developers. A facilitator (or two) helps 
keep time for the exercises, ensures the meeting stays on track, and 
remains available for questions.
Preparation
Participants should be equipped with the problem statement for the 
product they’ll be designing. They should also be given the product’s 
business goals, scenarios, personas, and any other previously agreed-
upon artifacts that will provide the context needed for their designs. It 
is very helpful to the participants if they aren’t seeing these items for 
the first time, so we work to get them distributed before the session.
It’s also important to have the right tools ready. You can find almost all 
of these tools at an office supply store and they are relatively inexpen­
sive. Here’s what we typically use (see also Figure 4-6):

FIGURE 4-6
Common supplies used in a Design Studio activity
•	 A timer for time-boxing each charrette. Time-boxing is nothing 
more than putting a limit on the amount of time for an activity.
•	 Paper for sketching. We use two kinds, 6-ups and 1-ups. Don’t get 
put off by the names; it’s just grid paper. 6-ups are pages broken 
down into six small grids, and 1-ups are one large grid. Really, any 
paper will do, but we use these because the smaller spaces on 6-ups 
used in early charrettes restrict participants from including too 
much detail.
•	 Black markers for sketching. We don’t let participants use pencil—
having the ability to erase can slow people down. Also, because 
markers draw thicker lines, they prevent people from getting too 
detailed.

100  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
•	 Red and green pens for the critique sessions. During critique, you 
can use green pens to mark the elements of a design that are con­
sidered particularly strong, or those that could be strong with more 
work. Use the red pens to mark elements that are considered inef­
fective or provide little value toward the product’s objectives.
•	 Painters tape to post sketches to the wall during critiques. Posting 
to the wall requires the designer to stand with his team. At times, 
we’ve noticed that in presentations designers will hold up their 
sketches and stand behind them as if they’re some sort of barrier 
between themselves and the rest of the team. Taping things up to 
the wall eliminates this.
The activity
The format of charrettes is as follows (see also Figure 4-7):
Charrette 1
Participants are given eight minutes to sketch as many concepts as 
they can come up with using the 6-up paper.
The goal of this round is for the participants to generate as many 
ideas as possible without over thinking things. Often, we’ll chal­
lenge participants to see if they can come up with at least five ideas.
When the time is up, participants post their sketches on the wall, 
present their ideas to their teammates (three minutes), and receive 
critique on them (four to five minutes).
Charrette 2
Participants take the feedback they heard during their critiques 
as well as the ideas and feedback that they heard their teammates 
present and receive and revisit their sketches. The participants now 
have eight minutes to iterate on their previous sketches and come 
up with a singular concept, again using 6-up paper. This allows 
individuals to form their own conclusions based on the strongest 
ideas that came up during the critiques as well as go a bit deeper 
into details.
When the eight minutes are up, the team tapes their sketches to 
the wall and again presents their concepts and receives critique. 
Just like in the first round, the participants get three minutes to 
present their sketches and receive critique from their team for four 
to five minutes.

Charrette 3
Participants are given 20 minutes to work collaboratively within 
their teams to come up with a singular design concept based on 
the critique they received in the last two rounds. By doing this, the 
teams work together to get a better understanding of how groups 
compromise and where consensus has been achieved.
When the time is up, teams present their concepts to the other 
teams to receive critique. The teams each have three minutes to 
present their ideas and seven minutes to receive critique from the 
other teams.
FIGURE 4-7
An overview of the 3 charrette model for a Design Studio activity
The aftermath
With the studio just about complete, we now have multiple concepts 
that are based on the ideas, critique, and compromise of each team. We 
next have participants talk about any common themes or patterns that 
emerged, making sure to document and share any open questions or 
assumptions that need to be validated.

102  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
It’s important to note that for most situations, we do not recommend 
using a studio to generate a single ultimate solution. In many cases, 
it’s unlikely that all of the considerations that need to be taken into 
account to determine a single solution can be addressed in the time 
constraints of a studio activity. Instead, as we use it, following the stu­
dio, the design team takes the ideas from the final charrette and works 
to create a single solution taking into account further analysis, critique, 
and other considerations and dependencies.
WHEN NOT TO USE DESIGN STUDIO
Design Studio is a great technique for quick collaboration, helping a 
team find consensus, and begin to see the direction that their design 
will take. But like any tool, it isn’t the best fit for every situation. 
Depending on your circumstances your project may not yet be in a 
position to utilize Design Studio or there may be circumstances that 
require you to rethink aspects of Design Studio or pursue a different 
approach all together. For example:
The problem hasn’t been framed adequately
If the problem hasn’t been adequately framed, there isn’t enough con­
text and definition to guide the team in generating ideas. Participants 
are left to generate ideas based on their individual understanding of the 
problem that is being solved. And they may struggle to generate any 
ideas because the lack of framing leaves the problem too nebulous with 
too many potential solutions to explore. 
The problem has been framed, but there 
is no agreement on the framing
In some cases, we find that a portion of the team, perhaps the design­
ers or researchers, has worked to frame the problem, but that framing 
hasn’t yet been shared, understood and agreed upon by the team. This 
can often derail a Design Studio because, rather than generate ideas, 
the group will instead become mired in discussion and debate about 
what the framing should be. This is of course, an important discussion 
to be had, but if this discussion starts when you’re trying to kick off a 
Design Studio, it means that the group isn’t ready and you should have 
had this conversation earlier.

 4. Making Critique a Part of Your Process   |  103
Alternatively, if you are able to get participants into the sketching phase 
of a studio without agreed upon framing, participants will generate 
ideas based on their own opinion of what the problem is, rather than 
a shared framing. This causes complications during the critiques and 
iterations in a studio because people are analyzing and judging the 
value of ideas on different sets of criteria.
A concept already exists from which the team can’t or won’t stray
Design Studio pushes participants to consider as many possibilities 
as they can come up with. This means that the ideas that emerge at 
the end of a studio may look very different than an existing design or 
product that the team already has. In order for Design Studios to be 
effective, the participants (and leadership) need to be OK with that. If 
the team has been instructed to make minimal changes to an existing 
design, then chances are they’ll struggle throughout a studio activity 
and with determining what to do with the ideas that arise from it.
The team is not open to using Design Studio
Design Studios require active participation. Everyone involved will be 
sketching, presenting and sharing their ideas. As such, participants 
need to approach the activity with attitudes that support it. 
Some people just won’t have an attitude that fits. Some will hate the 
idea of having to share their ideas. Some will hate the pressure of being 
asked to come up with solutions. Some just won’t want to participate at 
all. In these situations it’s worth it to at least try to get people involved, 
but if they repeatedly resist, it is not worth forcing the issue.
Overly complicated remote situations
Design Studio is best executed in person; for this activity, there is noth­
ing like collaborating and working together face to face. With that said, 
remote Design Studio can work (we both do them regularly with our 
teams) as long as expectations are clear from the beginning, teams are 
equipped with tools like document cameras, and a solid Internet con­
nection is available. Things get difficult when participants experience 
connection issues, or when a participant is working from an environ­
ment with lots of background activity and distractions.

104  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Another instance in which you might want to consider alternative tech­
niques, is when you have unbalanced remote distribution of your par­
ticipants. For example, if all but one person is located in one place, so 
everyone is working face to face except for the sole remote participant, it 
can become a bit difficult to work, particularly with respect to the group 
components of a studio. Or, if all your designers are in one location and 
your developers in another, it can be difficult because you don’t want 
your teams to be constructed entirely of people within the same role. 
The key is to think through how you’ll form your teams and how the 
people on those teams will interact and contribute. If you can figure out 
something that will work, you can probably pull off a remote studio. 
One common fall back for situations like this is to, regardless of who 
happens to be in the same location, have everyone participate virtually.
Conducting Design Reviews
Whereas standalone critiques and collaborative activities are great and 
recommended ways to incorporate critique into the design process, 
design reviews are a bit different.
Design reviews are a common type of meeting that we find in proj­
ects in most organizations. Sometimes they have different names. 
To clarify what we’re referring to, these meetings share the following 
characteristics:
•	 They are generally meetings held toward the end of the design 
phase.
•	 They include a goal of collecting approval from someone on the 
design thus far so that efforts can shift to some new focus—the 
design of a different set of functionality, a shift in process to devel­
opment, and so on.
•	 If approval is not captured, these meetings focus on identifying 
the changes that need to be made to obtain approval in the future.
Regardless of what they’re called, these meetings can be seen as a form 
of “gate,” something that the design and team needs to pass through in 
order to proceed to something else.
Because a design—and changes to it—is being discussed in these ses­
sions, they are often where teams we’ve worked with expect critique 
to be happening. However, even though feedback is a part of design 
www.it-ebooks.info

 4. Making Critique a Part of Your Process   |  105
reviews, they are not the same as critiques. The goals and logistics of 
these sessions in many cases make design reviews challenging for 
critique.
THE CHALLENGES DESIGN REVIEWS POSE TO CRITIQUE
Their intended outcome is approval
As previously mentioned, these sessions are typically held for the pur­
pose of getting an approval or sign-off of some kind, an agreement that 
it’s OK to shift the focus of work onto something else.
Even though their main activity is discussion of the design, the objec­
tive of these discussions is very different from those of a critique. 
Critiques are held with the intention of iterating on the design. It is 
understood and expected by all those involved that the design will be 
worked on further. The critique discussion is a tool used to inform 
where and how it might be iterated upon.
Specific changes are given as feedback
Because of this difference in objectives, in instances where approval 
isn’t received in design reviews, the feedback collected is often in the 
form of a list of what needs to change or be improved in the design. The 
thinking here is along the lines of, “It isn’t ready yet, but if you do these 
things and show it to us again, we’ll give you the OK.”
As we’ve shared in earlier chapters, though, critique isn’t about prob­
lem solving and specifying solutions. This is directive feedback and it 
is problematic to critique for a number of reasons.
Too many people and people with the wrong intentions 
are involved
The majority of the people we find in these meetings are there to 
ensure that their own list of interests and requirements are present in 
the final design, not necessarily comparing the design to its objectives 
to determine what might or might not be effective. When this is the 
setting, motives are skewed and goals are much different than in a nor­
mal critique session.
Additionally, because design reviews are usually to get approval, the 
group in the meeting is often too large to have productive conversa­
tions. Adam was once involved in a design review with more than 70

people in attendance, most by phone. How is it possible to have a pro­
ductive, coherent conversation with that many people all trying to make 
sure their voice is heard?
Design review timing is determined by the project’s timeline
The timing of design reviews is usually determined by a project’s time­
line and often held toward the end of a design phase or release cycle. 
Not only does this timing impede a team’s ability to collect and make 
use of critique because there isn’t enough time following the review to 
fully utilize it, but it is completely disjointed from when a team might 
actually need critique.
We should be able to conduct critiques whenever it’s useful for design­
ers to understand the impact or effect of the choices they’ve made so far 
in order to iterate further on their creations. This typically means that 
effective critiques can begin fairly early in the design process and are 
held numerous times throughout.
ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES OF DESIGN REVIEWS
None of this is to say that design reviews aren’t a necessity. For some 
organizations, the need to gather everyone and collect approvals or sign-
off is going to be essential. And, even though the intention behind cri­
tique differs from design reviews, the utility of the techniques we share 
in this book is to make feedback more useful in informing design deci­
sions. If you’ve found these meetings and the feedback collected from 
them to be challenging, using techniques for gathering and facilitating 
critique can go a long way to making them better.
Specifically, to address the challenges design reviews present, we rec­
ommend the following to help prepare and get the most out of them.
Take control of the review
This doesn’t mean that you need to hijack the meeting, per se, but try 
to get into as much of a lead role as possible. If you can be the one to 
set up and organize the meeting, do it. If you can be the one to lead and 
facilitate the meeting, do it. This way you have an opportunity to work 
toward steering discussions so that they focus on comparing the design 
to its objectives, not just whether it has approval. This will give you the 
opportunity to measure the feedback against the goals and the intended 
outcomes, and in so doing, help in getting actionable feedback.

 4. Making Critique a Part of Your Process   |  107
Recap the objectives
To the degree you’re able to, remind people of the agreed upon objec­
tives for the design. If you’re leading or facilitating the meeting, review 
these at the beginning of the session. If not, when you have a chance 
to speak try to bring them up. By reminding the team of the objectives 
for the project, you can inform their thinking so that it stays closer to 
the intent of critique.
Use the techniques we suggest for dealing with difficult people
In Chapter 6, we cover techniques for handling situations that involve 
people behaving in a difficult manner during a critique. It’s inevitable 
that you’ll encounter them. In many situations, the behaviors exhibited 
by participants in a design review are very similar to those situations. 
Techniques such as direct inquiry and laddering as well as strong facil­
itation skills go a long way toward getting better, more useful feedback 
out of design reviews.
Do not rely on design reviews for critique
We should not rely on design reviews as the only form of critique. If we 
are regularly critiquing before and leading up to a design review, the 
review can serve its purpose. It can act as a focused forum for approval 
of designs. Additionally, the team will have established a shared under­
standing about the goals and progress of the designs leading to a more 
focused review with fewer personal agendas.
Central Idea
Design reviews present challenges to the core intention of critique: con-
tinuous improvement. But, because the techniques used in critique work 
to make feedback more useful in the design process, they can be used to 
improve feedback gathered during design reviews.

108  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Wrapping Up
Critique’s primary utility is as an iteration driver. There are many, 
many opportunities for it to occur within our practice. Whenever we 
are looking to improve or iterate on an idea or process, or almost any­
thing, we have an opportunity for critique.
There are three points within the design process that present opportu­
nities for incorporating critique.
•	 Standalone critiques (both formal and informal or ad hoc): These 
are meetings or discussions with the solitary purpose of critiquing 
a creation so that it can be iterated upon further.
•	 Collaborative activities: Activities that bring team members 
together to work on idea generation and selection. Including cri­
tique in these activities helps teams identify where there is consen­
sus around ideas with the most value to the product’s objectives.
•	 Design reviews: Meetings that include some intention to collect 
sign-off or approval on a design. Although we recommend that 
these be handled separate from critiques, as feedback is collected 
during reviews, we can use many of the tools and techniques for 
critique to make the feedback collected as useful as possible.
No matter how you incorporate critique it’s important to remember the 
following:
•	 Start small. The more people involved in a conversation, the more 
difficult it is to manage. When introducing or practicing critique, 
start with small groups or just pairs and build from there.
•	 Think before you speak. Listening is paramount. How can you 
offer good feedback or act on the feedback you’ve received if you 
don’t accurately understand what you’re being told?
•	 Choose participants carefully. Critique is not for everyone. Some 
people struggle more than others. To the degree you can, think 
about how you put people together to best improve their skills and 
comfort level.

Facilitating Critique
We’ve described what goes into critique, the aspects of organizational 
culture that support it, and how critique fits within the design process. 
What about the conversations themselves? How can we make critique 
discussions go smoothly?
Facilitation is often seen as a tool for getting meetings or projects that 
have gotten out of hand back on track. But in reality, it has a much 
wider application.
Facilitation is the conscious, balanced management of conversations 
toward a conclusion. It begins with an understanding of the objectives 
and purpose of a discussion. It then works to ensure that those objec­
tives are met through measures that ask appropriate questions, ensure 
shared understanding, and allow participants to provide their perspec­
tives to the group. It’s a valuable skill that helps guide our conversations.
Because the best critiques are a dialogue, we can view facilitation as a 
vital component of the critique process. Without it, our critiques can 
become unruly, with participants analyzing different aspects of the 
design against their own criteria. Even though some of this analysis 
can turn out to be relevant and useful, a significant portion of it will 
not. And the inconsistent and sporadic nature of its delivery, due to the 
lack of structure, can make it difficult to follow and discern what is use­
ful and what isn’t, which ultimately impacts the decisions we make in 
our designs.
Through facilitation, we can provide structures with which people can 
share their individual thoughts. We can help ensure that participants 
maintain focus on the objectives of the design and keep in scope with 
regard to which aspects of the design are being discussed at any point 
in the conversation.

Chapter 2 discusses a basic framework or flow for critique, which you 
can see in Figure 5-1. This structure provides us with the flow we want 
to produce in our conversations using various facilitation methods as 
applicable.
FIGURE 5-1
The four questions that comprise the basic critique framework
Now, let’s talk about some of the rules, techniques, and other things to 
keep in mind as we work to focus our feedback discussions and make them 
more effective. Although what we’ll cover in this chapter is written from 
the perspective of facilitating formal critiques, namely meetings set up 
specifically for critique, or for which critique is a significant item on 
the agenda, much of it also applies to casual, informal discussions, as 
well. Facilitation isn’t always a formal role. Sometimes it’s just a matter 
of the questions you choose to ask and how you choose to ask them.”
Central Idea
Facilitation is an invaluable skill when it comes to gathering useful critique. 
Strong facilitation keeps critique conversations focused and productive.

 5. Facilitating Critique   |  111
Understanding the Rules of Critique
There are four key rules that we need to keep in mind. Paying attention 
to these rules will help to ensure that our discussion remains focused, 
efficient, and effective. It’s the facilitator’s job to make certain these 
rules are adhered to, but it’s a good idea to share them with the team.
Especially in formal critiques, we want to confirm that all participants 
know about and understand these rules. Don’t hesitate to review them 
quickly at the beginning of the discussion or post them in the room 
where the critique is being conducted.
EVERYONE IS EQUAL
Organizational hierarchy has an uncanny ability to make people feel 
like their perspectives and opinions carry more or less weight than 
others. Although it’s true that an organization might make decisions 
based on what its leaders think as opposed to other employees, it isn’t 
inherently true that their opinions are more accurate just because 
they’re executives.
It is important in a critique that we remember this and that everyone’s 
observations and perspectives are listened to equally. More attention 
should not be paid to those of a higher position just because of that 
position. You may be familiar with the acronym HiPPO (Highest Paid 
Person’s Opinion); it’s a killer when it comes to effective critique.
Moreover, the contributors themselves should feel like, and see oth­
ers as, equal contributors. They should recognize that their feedback 
is just as valued as that of everyone else, regardless of their job title. 
Useful insights can come from anyone and, if participants are sensing 
an inequality, they might be hesitant to share their feedback. Or, they 
might decide to just go along with the feedback expressed by someone 
else instead of voicing their own perspectives. When this happens, we 
can miss out on valuable information.
Think about your team or the people you’ll be pulling together for the 
critique and see if you can, from past experience, sense how much of 
an issue this will be. Consider talking to the group about this rule and 
others beforehand. We’ve even had success in some situations talking 
directly with the team members and executives whose opinions are 
being catered to about the issue and gotten their help in addressing the 
issue. Remember, it isn’t the case that everyone in this position wants 
www.it-ebooks.info

112  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
this kind of behavior. Many of the executives we’ve worked with have 
recognized the negative effect it can have on a team and their work and 
have taken steps to address it.
During a session, if you notice that people are being quiet because of a 
“superior’s” participation, ask for feedback directly from those people. 
Or, if someone is throwing their weight around with their opinions, 
consider talking to them about it, perhaps after the meeting to avoid it 
happening again in the future. To address the inequality seen in cri­
tiques he’s run, Adam has even called breaks during which he’s raised 
concerns to the organization leaders in attendance.
If we begin with a level playing field, when it comes time to make deci­
sions on how to iterate and develop our designs, we can ensure that 
we are able to hear perspectives from across the team. And later, as we 
review the feedback collected, we can take into consideration an indi­
vidual’s expertise and experience, and not focus solely on her position 
in the hierarchy.
Eliminating the influence of organizational hierarchy can be a tough 
rule to implement depending on the culture of a team or organization. 
But for critique to be successful, it is a key element. Remember that cri­
tique is not direction. Even though it’s true that in many organizations 
a director, executive, or other leader’s decisions will take priority over 
the thoughts of others, we want to keep that separate, and hopefully 
after a critique. Part of what we want to reveal in the critique is a variety 
of perspectives from different areas of expertise so that any decisions 
made later are as well informed as they can be.
EVERYONE IS A CRITIC
Everyone in the critique session should participate. Some individuals 
might be intimidated or won’t feel like they have anything of value to 
contribute because they aren’t a designer. Or, they might just not feel 
comfortable saying things that they fear will make the designer feel 
bad. But as we mentioned in the previous rule, great insights can come 
from anyone, and we can miss out on helpful information when people 
do not participate in critiques.
Ensuring that everyone participates also helps prevent situations in 
which an individual might not say much during the critique but ends 
up expressing any concerns he had after the fact, when it is often too 
late to act on those concerns.

AVOID PROBLEM SOLVING
This can be the hardest of all the rules. Avoiding problem solving can 
be tough. We do it instinctively. It is a natural inclination for many 
of us to come up with solutions as soon as we perceive a problem or 
inefficiency.
To understand why this is problematic in critique, we need to remem­
ber that the human brain does not consciously think both analytically 
(taking in and comparing information) and creatively (generating pos­
sible solutions by combining ideas [otherwise known as problem solv­
ing]) simultaneously. This process of multitasking instead forces our 
brain to divide resources between the two processes and then actively 
switch between them.
In earlier chapters we described the toggle our brains make between 
creative and analytical thinking while we’re working. It happens so fre­
quently that we often aren’t even aware it’s happening. It can take a lot 
of practice and skill to keep our brains from bouncing back and forth, 
and to remain focused on just one process.
When an individual in a critique begins proposing a new solution or a 
change, it means that she’s switched mindsets. Her brain has toggled 
from analytical thinking to creative thinking.
Now think about this toggle happening independently within every 
participant in a critique. You can begin to see why it’s problematic. 
When new ideas start being proposed, you have some folks in the cri­
tique who are in a creative mental process, some in an analytical one 
(still analyzing the original design), some analyzing the new idea, and 
some in a third process: comprehension (trying to just understand the 
new idea).
More than likely, some people’s brains are jumping from one process 
to another. A big challenge in facilitating any discussion, not just cri­
tiques, is keeping everyone focused on the same objective. In the case 
of a critique, that objective is analysis of the design being presented. 
When problem solving begins to happen, the coordination becomes 
lost and everyone heads in different mental directions.

On top of that, problem solving can derail the session by not allowing 
session goals to be met due to the focus switching to solving a specific 
issue seen in the design rather than analyzing the aspects for which we 
were looking to collect insights. If we have five items to review and cri­
tique in the meeting and we veer off to problem solving while looking 
at item number two, the chances are that we’ll never make it to item 
number three, never mind five.
But it’s too damned difficult to not solve problems.
The tendency to generate ideas for solutions can be instinctual and 
unconscious. You’ve probably seen this yourself in one form or another. 
It’s not uncommon during a usability test, or in any environment really, 
to hear someone encountering an issue say something like, “they really 
should…” or “it would be better if they…” before ever articulating the 
problem he’s trying to solve.
If that’s the case, how can we expect to prevent a room full of people 
from doing it when we ask them to analyze our designs?
Well, we can’t.
What’s important here is to understand why the problem solving is hap­
pening and the impact it can have on the remainder of the discussion.
If someone has jumped to a solution without describing the issue in 
the design that she’s trying to solve, ask questions that work toward 
identifying what that issue is and how it relates to the objectives of the 
design.
If someone is spending a lot of time trying to describe his new solu­
tion to you, and you understand the issue or insight he’s trying to raise, 
work toward getting him to hold onto that idea for a future discussion 
that will be focused on exploration so that you can continue with the 
analysis as planned, as depicted in Figure 5-2.
Here’s another possibility: if everyone gets really hung up on a spe­
cific issue with the design and can’t avoid trying to solve it, or perhaps 
the impact of how it might be solved is so huge that it brings further 
critique of the current into question, try pausing or postponing the 
remainder of the critique and switch right then to exploring solutions.
What is paramount is to keep everyone in the same mental process.

DON’T RUSH TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THE CHANGES TO BE MADE
The output of a critique is not a list of specific changes for the designer 
to go back and make. Instead, the desired output is a set of new obser­
vations and understandings about the design and whether it is meeting 
the objectives set for it. This goes back to the previous rule. If a list of 
changes is coming out of a critique session, problem solving is taking 
the place of analysis.
After a critique should come a period of exploration, using the new 
insights to frame challenges and generate possible solutions. For some 
of the insights uncovered during a critique, the changes to be made will 
be small and obvious, but for many there is the potential for numerous 
solutions to be thought of and we should give ourselves time to do this. 
If we rush to make all of the decisions on changes to be made while 
we’re still trying to analyze things in our critique, it’s likely that we’ll

miss opportunities for stronger ideas or make premature decisions that 
cause more problems down the road. This is another rule that might 
raise some eyebrows when sharing it with your team.
Waiting to make decisions affords the designer time to digest all of 
the feedback she received during the session. She can examine it in 
light of the goals, principles, scenarios, and personas of the project. 
The designer can then follow up with individuals or the entire group 
about specific points of feedback and continue the discussion, idea gen­
eration, and exploration.
The “I Like…” or “I Don’t Like…” Rule
Often, when we talk about the rules of critique we are asked about 
the rule of thumb on avoiding the use of the phrases “I like…” or “I 
don’t like….” The thinking behind this rule is that critique itself isn’t 
about what the individual likes or dislikes; that likely is not relevant to 
whether the design is meeting its objectives.
Although this is true, in our experience telling people that they can’t 
use these phrases hampers the flow of a critique discussion. These two 
phrases are such a natural part of how many of us speak that it is inevi­
table that people will use them. If they’ve been informed that they can’t 
use them and do inadvertently, they apologize, become flustered, and 
try to regroup, sometimes losing clarity around the point they were try­
ing to make and causing some awkwardness in the exchange.
When someone states that he likes or doesn’t like something in a cri­
tique, what’s important is to then facilitate the conversation to under­
stand whether his reasons are pertinent to the objectives of the design.
Central Idea
Having rules for critique helps to set expectations for others as to how the 
critique session should work. It also helps participants by providing guide-
lines and boundaries to the framework for sharing their insights and having 
productive conversations. The rules should be shared with others before the 
session; in fact, it’s a good idea to post them in the meeting room.

Preparing for and Kicking Off a Critique
Getting a critique off on the right foot is important. Faulty starts can 
derail the discussion, causing confusion and a need to spend all our 
time getting everyone on the same page. Presenting quickly, reviewing 
the rules of critique, and focusing participants on specific aspects of 
the design are a few critical components of a good start.
WHO SHOULD WE INCLUDE?
Who participates in a critique is important and can affect the outcome 
of the session. We should look beyond just the design team for poten­
tial attendees. Consider other members of the project team as well, for 
example developers, marketing professionals, business analysts, prod­
uct managers, subject matter experts (SMEs), project managers, and 
even executive stakeholders.
Even though there will be times when we’ll want a smaller, more 
focused session with just the design team or people from a specific 
role, it’s important to remember that anyone, regardless of role, can cri­
tique. By including a diverse group people from our team, we will open 
up the possibility for alternate viewpoints and ways of thinking analyti­
cally. Additionally, by including a range of disciplines as our attendees, 
we help build collaboration across the project team.
Additional consideration for who we’ll include should be based on 
expertise related to the aspects of the design on which we wish to focus 
the critique. For example, if we are building a customer service applica­
tion, it will be beneficial to invite someone from the customer support 
team to provide her insights, because she is close to the customer, and 
more than likely will be using the tool we are creating. SMEs do not 
need to have design background or knowledge; most of the time they 
will understand the need we’re designing for, which makes their input 
very valuable.
As for the number of people to include, remember that critique is a 
conversation. Think about the maximum number of attendees who can 
carry on a single conversation without it splintering off into side dis­
cussions. In our experience, that’s about six people. That doesn’t mean 
that if we’re in a position where we’re required to have more people in 
attendance that we can’t critique. It’s just likely to take a bit more active 
facilitation, or perhaps the session will need to be broken into smaller 
groups.

118  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
ENSURE THAT THE TEAM KNOWS THE CRITIQUE SESSION 
FORMAT AND THE PLANS FOR FACILITATING IT
The people we invite to the session—whether they are designers or 
from another discipline—will have varying backgrounds and experi­
ences with feedback and critique. Some might not be familiar with cri­
tique at all. Thus, it is important to set some expectations.
Particularly in formal critiques, but sometimes in informal ones as 
well, it is a good idea to begin by talking with participants about the 
type of discussion we’re looking to have and any details about how we 
plan to facilitate the conversation. The less familiar a group is with 
critique, the more important this can become. We need to set expecta­
tions with regard to the kind of feedback we’re interested in and why. 
Sharing the parts of the design you plan to focus on as well as critique 
rules is useful as well. The more the team understands about how the 
session is expected to go, the more they can come prepared to partici­
pate in a productive manner.
AVOID “TA-DA” MOMENTS
As designers, it is common for us to take the information we gather 
during research and analysis to our desks and work like a mad scientist 
on our creations. When the time is right we emerge with grand plans to 
show our awesome design to the team. We unveil our creation: “Ta-da! 
Look what I’ve made.” And then we wait for the applause…
Crickets
The response we get is often not what we’d hoped for. Most, if not all 
of the people we’re revealing our designs to are just seeing the designs 
for the first time and can only really have a gut reaction to what they 
are seeing. This is reactive feedback, and as we’ve described, it is rarely 
useful when it comes to helping us iterate and improve on our designs.
Critical thought takes a little bit of time. People need to think through 
a process or elements of a design, determine the effects they believe 
they’ll have, and then compare those effects to the desired objectives. 
When we wait until the critique to show our work and expect imme­
diate feedback, we put our team in a position to give us responses that 
they have not had the time to think through.

If possible, we suggest getting the designs that are going to be critiqued 
out to those participating in the meeting before the critique takes 
place. This gives participants the time to review the designs and think 
through their feedback and questions. Sending the designs out a cou­
ple of days in advance is often enough.
Now, we know what some of you are thinking: “No way! If I send out 
the designs ahead of time I will get a ton of feedback via email. People 
will be focusing on the wrong things, or I will just get a list of changes 
from people.”
This is completely understandable. Or, perhaps no one will bother to 
look at what we’ve sent and so sending things out ahead of time feels 
wasteful. The truth of the matter is that no matter which route we 
choose, there will always be people who do their own thing. Still, we 
need to do what we can to avoid creating situations where reactions are 
all we can collect. By avoiding the “Ta-da!” moment approach we help 
our teams and clients to provide us with the feedback and insights that 
are needed to improve our designs.
To minimize participants getting stuck on an aspect of the design that 
might be irrelevant to that on which you plan to focus your critique dis­
cussion, limit what you send to only the relevant aspects of the design 
you plan to discuss. If you want to focus on one particular flow, don’t 
send wireframes or storyboards for the entire product. Also, preface the 
designs with a few clear notes on what the critique will focus on and 
what you expect from participants. Figure 5-3 shows an example of an 
email Adam recently used on one of his projects.
Note that we aren’t asking participants to come to the meeting with 
their feedback ready. Rather, we want to get them to begin thinking 
about the design and any questions they might have. What we’re trying 
to do is jump-start the critical thinking process prior to the beginning 
of the conversation itself.
Yes, there are some people who will respond to your email with feed­
back. To be transparent with you, Adam did in response to the email 
in Figure 5-3.

FIGURE 5-3
An example of a sample critique session notification email
What we do in situations like this is reply to any feedback we might 
receive letting the sender know that we’ve noted it and that we’ll plan to 
address it in the critique session. When the time for the critique session 
comes, we revisit the feedback we received from that individual. We ask 
if the feedback is still relevant now that more about the design has been 
discussed. As a result, the individual(s) who provided feedback either 
understands why decisions were made and rescinds her feedback, or 
the feedback is discussed further to gain more understanding.
By acknowledging the individual’s feedback and then addressing it in 
the critique, we are letting her know that we are not dismissing this 
feedback, but we’re also working on facilitating productive conversa­
tions. Although situations like this might not be ideal, they do provide 
the opportunity to improve facilitation and communication skills.
For situations in which you don’t have the opportunity to send things 
out ahead of time, or perhaps you did and no one bothered to look at 
what you sent, simply pace the conversation a bit slower initially. Give 
people a chance to think critically. To do this, focus on smaller, more 
discrete aspects of the design at first and collect critique on those. Ask

specific questions about a design element with respect to a particular 
goal or principle. Your objective here is to not overwhelm participants 
by dumping a lot of information on them all at once.
DESCRIBE THE PRODUCT’S OBJECTIVES
Whether you’re sending out emails in preparation for the critique 
session or standing in front of the room presenting your work to the 
group, be sure to remind the team of the goals, principles, scenarios, 
and personas that apply to the aspects of the designs being reviewed. 
This will help provide the correct context for the participants to analyze 
the designs. 
You don’t need to go into great detail about how the product will meet 
those objectives, but it is important to keep these goals in the forefront 
of the team’s mind so that they can focus and frame their feedback 
accurately. If you’re using a tool such as a mini brief (see Chapter 3 for 
more on this), this can be as simple as doing a quick read-through of 
the pertinent elements at the very beginning of the meeting.
PRESENT YOUR WORK QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY
When presenting work for feedback it is a common urge to overexplain 
things to ensure that those critiquing really understand the design, 
the choices that were made, and the reasons why they were made. But 
this approach can often slow things down and eat up the time in the 
meeting.
We need to present efficiently. This doesn’t mean that we have to rush 
through the presentation, but rather keep an efficient, steady pace. We 
should walk the team through the specific aspect of the design that we 
want to discuss and not worry about explaining our rationale for every 
decision; just give enough of an explanation so that the team gets an 
understanding of how the design is intended to work. If at some point 
we feel as though we went too quickly, we can make mention of it and 
ask if there are any questions or anything that we can clear up.
From there, more details about the effectiveness of decisions with 
regard to the project’s objective, or the thinking behind decisions can 
come out as participants ask questions.

122  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
It is natural to want to dive into all the details of our design so that 
everyone understands what we are trying to accomplish, but it’s more 
effective to let additional details, such as the rationale behind our deci­
sions, come about as participants ask questions.
Allowing for questions to be asked is a critical part of an effective pre­
sentation. When we try to explain every detail up front, it’s as if we’re 
trying to avoid the potential for questions. We bombard participants 
with so much that they can become overwhelmed.
Another consideration for presenting efficiently is to focus your pre­
sentation on what isn’t obvious or can’t be seen easily (see Figure 5-4). 
Focus on talking about the aspects of the design that the participants 
can’t see. Participants likely don’t need to be made aware of the fact that 
the navigation is at the top of a web page followed by the header. A way 
we commonly do this is to present the design from the perspective of 
a user.
If we give a focused walkthrough and then prompt for questions—
sometimes by starting to ask questions ourselves—we give partici­
pants the opportunity to tell us when they’re ready for, or need, addi­
tional information to aid in their understanding and analysis. They get 
what they need when they need it. By allowing the details to come for­
ward through the questions and conversation that happens during the 
critique, the details about the design and decisions we made are more 
closely tied to participant’s insights and questions.
BE CAREFUL WHEN TALKING ABOUT CONSTRAINTS
While designing, teams will run into no shortage of constraints. These 
might stem from the workings of legacy systems, infrastructure lim­
itations, deadlines, budgets, or a variety of other business or technical 
decisions. While initially presenting part of a design, it’s not uncom­
mon to want to include mention of the constraints we faced, especially 
if the constraint was particularly frustrating and forced us to make a 
decision that we feel is less than ideal. In these situations, however, 
some participants will often interpret the constraints we discuss as 
excuses or possibly even that we’re casting blame. As a result, they can 
have a negative impact on the tone and energy of the discussion.

124  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
In these situations it’s often better to let discussion of the constraint 
arise through questions. Wait for someone to ask about why choices 
were made and, if relevant, explain the constraint(s), choosing your 
words thoughtfully so that it doesn’t sound as though you’re blaming 
the constraint for a decision you wish was otherwise. Be as matter-of-
fact about it as possible, and, if needed, set up additional time later to 
further discuss the constraint and its impact.
In some cases, it can also be useful to wait to discuss constraints after 
the critique is over and insights are being reviewed. Follow up with 
the person who provided the insight, discuss the constraint with them, 
and, if needed, bring in someone who can provide more information 
about the constraint and how you might be able to work around it.
There is one instance for which including a constraint in your presen­
tation is appropriate: if you’ve discussed the constraint in a previous 
discussion with the group and are presenting your solution to it. In 
this case, the team is already aware of the constraint, and so how you 
addressed it is part of the context they need to help understand your 
presentation. Again though, be careful with wording and be as matter-
of-fact as possible.
Central Idea
Proper preparation for a critique session can make a world of difference 
when it comes to getting the insights that will help improve what you are 
working on. Ensure that participants know what is being critiqued, how the 
sessions will be run, and what the goals of the session are.

The Facade of Authority
It’s easy to assume that when you take on 
the role of a facilitator during any form of col-
laborative session, you earn a certain level of 
authority over the participants in the room. 
Sadly, this isn’t the case. In fact, the author-
ity you hold as a facilitator is only as strong as 
your personality and overall social presence. 
The true owners of the room are the participants of the session. If you hap-
pen to be dealing with a group of strong personalities or folks who are used 
to being the voice of authority in a room, your ability to effectively facilitate 
the group is going to be a fun little challenge.
I ran into this issue—my false authority as a facilitator was called out and it 
resulted in losing any resemblance of control or flow—during a series of col-
laborative workshops I was running. 
The workshop that suffered the most was the design studio, which was sup-
posed to result in a strong vision for the future that the client needed to help 
sell the need for a new platform and design for one of their internal applica-
tions. The worst part about it was that I was to blame.
As the group was beginning to settle in and I was about to review the pur-
pose of a design studio and what would be expected of the participants, I 
asked if everyone would put away their laptops. No sooner had I asked for 
this small favor, than one of the more outspoken personalities responded 
with “Good luck with that!” After the laughter died down, I responded with 
a wisecrack of my own explaining how he had just shattered any sense of 
authority I had over the other participants. The result of this little joke was 
that all the participants became aware how little authority I really had, and 
they all refused to put away their laptops.
One of the biggest benefits of a design studio is the idea sharing and the 
various rounds of critique that occurs between the design iterations. Now, 
with their attention split between the activity and their laptops, the rounds 
of critique that followed were shallow. By the end of the session, there was 
little to no group consensus on the direction of the new solution or what 
kind of priority needed to be assigned to the various features.

126  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
I learned a very important lesson that day not only about how to facilitate 
a design studio and critique, but about facilitation as a whole. The trick is 
in becoming a group leader rather than an authority figure that is directing 
people to do things that might be outside of their comfort zone.
Several tools are necessary to make this happen, however:
An outline and agenda
The most important tools, these set the tone of an activity and estab-
lish a defined set of rules for the session. These are documents that can 
be shared prior, and become something that helps to establish a social 
contract between you, the facilitator, and the group of participants.
A timetable
This written-out breakdown of activities, discussion points, and breaks 
can be part of your written agenda or a standalone document. The 
timetable is something that is reviewed with the group at the start of 
a session, and it allows time to be the authority in the room, which you 
the facilitator are simply enforcing.
The more external artifacts that you can use as sources of authority, the eas-
ier it is for you to manage the flow of the conversation and maintain control 
over personalities that would normally overpower other participants and 
create an unproductive environment for collaboration, sharing, and critique.
Tools and Techniques for Effective Facilitation
It’s important to have a tool set and planned strategies for dealing with 
various situations that might arise during a critique.
DEFINING THE CRITIQUE SCOPE AND GOALS
We need to determine scope and goals for the products we are creating 
in order to help us to stay on track and focus on our outcomes during 
the course of the project. Similarly, a successful critique should also 
have defined goals and scope to guide the team focused on collecting 
the relevant and desired insights of each session.
The scope of a critique is an identification of the components of the 
design that the team will be analyzing and the objectives against which 
they’ll be analyzed.

 5. Facilitating Critique   |  127
For example, one session might focus on critiquing the visual styles of 
a design against a particular set of design principles, whereas another 
session might be focused on critiquing a specific sequence of screens 
and interactions against the relevant scenario and goals.
Setting the discussion parameters helps participants to know what 
to expect and to stay on track during the conversation and gives you 
a direction to steer back to when people begin discussions that are 
beyond the scope of the session.
For situations in which participants do begin to veer beyond the set 
parameters, we can now make note and plan for additional discus­
sions while still getting the session at hand back on track to collect the 
insights we need at that point in time.
With the scope of a critique session set, identifying the goals can be 
fairly straightforward:
1.	 Identifying what is working in the designs with respect to the iden­
tified scope
2.	 Identifying anything that isn’t working in the designs with respect 
to the identified scope
3.	Gathering insights on any specific questions the designer may 
have
4.	 Identifying any concerns, open questions, and assumptions
Another way to identify goals and scope is to do reverse planning. In 
this approach, we begin by identifying what actions you want to be able 
to take after the conversation. From that identification, we can think 
about what questions we need answered in the critique in order to take 
those actions. And finally, understanding the questions we need to dis­
cuss and answer gives us an indication of the aspects of the design we 
need to present and focus our discussion on.
For example, imagine we’re designing a new application for filing an 
auto insurance claim. Part of the design includes a new change in the 
filing process in which the customer can digitally submit photos of 
damage to get an appraisal in minutes. Imagine that we also know that 
a usability study is planned in the next few weeks that will focus on 
observing how people react and are able to use this new process.

This would imply that, going into our usability study, we want to ensure 
that our prototype is the best reflection of what the process and the 
experience using it would be.
So, given that we have some time to iterate between now and the usabil­
ity study, then a logical scope would be to focus on the scenarios that 
would utilize this new claims process. Potential goals for this critique 
might be:
•	 Identifying the aspects of the design that do not support the 
desired experience.
•	 Identifying the aspects of the design that are most effective in 
producing the desired experience so that they can perhaps be 
expanded upon.
•	 Identifying the aspects of the design where there are the most 
questions or disagreement amongst the team, so that the usability 
study can take them into consideration and perhaps incorporate 
them into the study’s plan
IMPLEMENTING ACTIVE LISTENING
Hearing is easy; listening is difficult. It sounds cliché, but it’s true. We 
all interpret things in different ways. We all have a multitude of things 
going through our minds at any one time. And, we all have brains that 
are often more focused on getting our own perspective out than listen­
ing to and understanding that of someone else. 
With a diverse group of participants (or even a group of only design­
ers) this challenge becomes compounded. Vocabulary and understand­
ing of terminology is going to vary among participants. We can’t take 
everything communicated to us in a critique at face value and assume 
that everyone has the same understanding of what a piece of feedback 
means. We need to ensure that the designer as well as the rest of the 
team have a shared understanding of the insights being raised.
Active listening is when we reply to the feedback we’re given by repeat­
ing it back as we’ve understood it. The person who originally gave the 
feedback can then confirm whether our understanding matches the 
point he was trying to communicate. Here is an example:

 5. Facilitating Critique   |  129
Product Owner: I have a concern about the placement of the news 
feed on the screen; it is very prominent, but I don’t think our customers 
actually use it that much.
Designer: OK. If I understand you correctly you are concerned that this 
news feed, because it might not be used much, is attracting too much 
attention and can be distracting users from other more important ele­
ments? Am I correct in my understanding?
Product Owner: Yes, we should explore a different treatment so that 
we can give higher priority to something the customer uses more.
By responding to feedback in this manner we are able to validate 
whether our understanding is accurate.
After we have established that we have an understanding, we can dis­
cuss more details about the point being raised. For example, after the 
preceding exchange, the designer could ask about what in the current 
treatment of the newsfeed gives it significant prominence. Is it the 
placement, the type size, or some other aspect?
For those times when our understanding is inaccurate, we can then 
ask questions that dig into the feedback for further clarity. For exam­
ple, in the previous exchange, if the product owner responded that the 
designer’s understanding was inaccurate, the designer might respond 
with something like:
Can you help me understand a bit more about your concern about the 
news feed’s prominence?
or:
OK. Let’s look at this a little more. What might happen if we left it as 
prominent as it is?
By asking questions we can get more information to help us refine and 
adjust our understanding of the concern being raised. A particularly 
effective technique we’ve seen is illustrated in the second question. 
These kinds of questions prompt the participant to further describe 
the effect on the user, or the behaviors or actions that are undesirable, 
which we can then relate to the objectives of the product.

ADDING SIMPLE STRUCTURES: ROUND ROBIN AND QUOTAS
Sometimes, a group—particularly one that’s new to critique—has 
trouble getting a conversation started. The group has difficulty letting 
the critique flow as naturally as a casual conversation would. People 
sit around looking at one another awkwardly, not sure what to do. In 
these cases, sometimes adding a very simple structure can give people 
a predicable format that lets them know what’s expected.
One example of these simple structures is the Round Robin. When 
using Round Robin, the person facilitating the critique goes around 
the room in a specific, repeatable order, calling on and collecting feed­
back from participants. This eliminates waiting to see who speaks 
first. It also reinforces that everyone should participate and gives par­
ticipants some predictability as to when they’ll get the chance to share 
their feedback.
Round Robin doesn’t need to be used for the entire duration of the dis­
cussion. In fact, we recommend you do not use it for the entire session. 
It can be a great way to get things started, but after the conversation 
is going, Round Robin doesn’t exactly fit a natural flow, and forcing it 
unnaturally can hinder the critique.
We’ve also seen it used at the very end of a critique as a way to give 
everyone a chance to share anything they might not have gotten to 
during the critique.
Another structure to consider using is Quotas. With Quotas, the facil­
itator lets the team know that an objective of the critique is to collect a 
certain number of things that are working well and things that aren’t 
(often two that aren’t and one that is) from each participant. For exam­
ple, each participant should share two aspects of the design that they 
feel are strong, and one that isn’t. The formula of the quota can vary, 
and we definitely suggest trying different combinations of quotas to see 
what works most effectively.
With these types of structures, however, it’s important to recognize 
that some groups can find them annoying because they seem too basic 
or, as we’ve heard on some occasions, “too grade-school.”
So, think about your group before electing to use either of these tech­
niques. Are there attitudes or past interactions that indicate your par­
ticipants might have these kinds of interactions? Often we recommend 
waiting until a team clearly has difficulty getting a critique session

started before bringing these structures up as a possible solution. With 
Round Robin, the facilitator doesn’t even need to mention that she will 
be using the format to the attendees; she can keep that to herself as a 
structure for facilitating the critique.
When the conversation gets going, the facilitator can ease off of these 
structures and just let the critique happen naturally.
USING DIRECT INQUIRY
Sometimes, there might be a participant in a critique whose expertise 
is particularly relevant to the aspects of the design you’re critiquing or 
the objectives for which you’re designing. It’s not uncommon for indi­
viduals in an organization to become the sole knowledge keeper for 
a particular business process or system. In these cases, it’s perfectly 
acceptable to ask that individual directly for his thoughts.
Years ago, I was on a project to redesign a customer service platform 
for a large organization. The company had a particular audience subset 
that had very specific needs and distinct processes from the others for 
a variety of complicated legal and compliance reasons. Because this 
audience was smaller, the service team that handled their issues was 
also small, and one individual who handled all of their training was con­
sidered to be the company expert.
Although it was important that the design take into account all audi­
ences and that I collect feedback from perspectives across the team, it 
was clear that there was still a knowledge gap. Even with the personas 
and scenarios taken from our research, no one on the team understood 
this small group of service reps and client the way our company expert 
did. And because this group was small, it was easy for conversations 
to leave them out.
That meant that I, as a facilitator, needed to pay extra attention to 
ensuring that that didn’t happen. In addition to focusing critique dis­
cussions on the relevant scenarios and personas, I would also pose 
questions directly to our expert, giving him a chance to share his per­
spective. This helped us to balance our conversations and precluded 
our missing key considerations for the design.

132  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
By asking questions of people directly, we can be certain that we take 
advantage of the opportunities we have to gather perspectives that are 
particularly relevant to the information we want to capture in a cri­
tique. This also means that it’s a good idea for the individual facilitat­
ing a critique to have an understanding of a participant’s particular 
expertise so that he can be aware when a relevant question comes up 
and ensure that those individuals get a chance to share their thoughts.
PUTTING ON THE THINKING HATS (LENS-BASED ANALYSIS)
Similar to setting the scope of the critique, using Thinking Hats helps 
participants to frame their feedback in a certain context, making it a 
bit easier to maintain productive discussion and provide actionable 
feedback.
The Six Thinking Hats is a facilitation technique created by Edward de 
Bono, M.D., and described in the book he authored of the same name. 
The six hats method uses colored hats to represent different ways of 
analyzing a problem space or design. Throughout the session the team 
will switch hats to change perspective. Following is a description of 
each hat:
White hat
The white hat takes the focus and puts it on facts alone for analysis, 
with no speculation.
Yellow hat
The yellow hat represents looking at the positive, focusing on what 
is working.
Black hat
The black hat focuses on concerns, difficulties, or why something 
might not work. Black-hat thinking is often seen when someone 
plays the role of devil’s advocate.
Red hat
The red hat focuses on feelings that participants have in response 
to what they are analyzing. Hunches, fears, emotional responses, 
and personal likes and dislikes all make up red-hat thinking.

 5. Facilitating Critique   |  133
Green hat
The green hat focuses on creativity and generating new concepts 
and understandings.
Blue hat
The blue hat identifies the individual who is managing the discus­
sion, determining its focus, goals, and so on. It is the one hat that 
is not shared by the group.
The Six Thinking Hats is a lens-based analysis technique. When using 
the Six Thinking Hats, team members all wear the same color hat at 
the same time; this keeps everyone analyzing the designs through the 
same “lens,” keeping the conversation focused.
While de Bono’s version established six specific hats, teams can also 
come up with their own lenses to fit their context. For example, if work­
ing with multiple personas, teams might use each persona as a lens, 
analyzing the design for a particular scenario in the context of one per­
sona’s needs, expectations, and behaviors before moving on to another.
TAKING NOTES
Taking notes is a must for any formal critique, and it isn’t a bad idea for 
informal ones, either. It’s not uncommon for discussions to go so deep 
or so broad that people forget everything that was said. And when that 
forgotten feedback is something that could be valuable to iterating on a 
design, our efforts to facilitate great critiques lose some of their value.
Notes are the simplest way to ensure that everything is captured. They 
provide documentation of the points and ideas raised during the dis­
cussion, and the designer and team can review them later as needed.
We recommend that in a critique, one individual be designated as the 
note taker and that she records notes publicly. It’s not unusual for peo­
ple to take their own notes in meetings and then share them later, but 
our experiences have shown that this approach can be problematic. 
Each person’s notes are their own interpretation of what is being dis­
cussed. Trying to merge notes from a group of people can be confusing 
and time consuming.

134  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
By having one individual take notes publicly—in a manner where 
everyone in the discussion can see what is being captured—we can 
avoid these challenges. This way the team members can look at exactly 
what is being written and question or clarify it if it does not match their 
understanding. There are a number of ways we can do this. It can be 
as simple as writing on an easel pad, or if presenting digitally, adding 
annotations or comments to screenshots in a tool such as Acrobat or 
InVision.
It’s also useful to take note of how people participate. These notes 
aren’t taken publicly as those just mentioned—that would be pretty 
awkward—but they are important. By watching how people participate 
during the session, we can see what facilitation techniques worked, 
and what didn’t. We can see who is interested and participates and 
who is not interested. Then, we can use this information to determine 
how best to gather feedback from the team and who to invite to future 
critiques.
USING THIRD-PARTY FACILITATORS
Using a third-party facilitator—someone from outside the team or proj­
ect—to run a critique can be helpful when a team is just beginning to 
implement regular critiques as a part of the design process. A third-
party facilitator does not provide feedback on the design as a partic­
ipant would. His role is purely to guide the conversation and keep it 
within scope by making sure people are able to ask questions and share 
their perspectives, while ensuring that those perspectives are under­
stood by all participants. Because they control the flow of the conversa­
tion, the designer is better able to capture notes, present designs, clar­
ify points, and respond to questions.
However, this shift in control can sometimes create challenges, too. 
The designer on the project will be responsible for acting on the 
insights collected, and is therefore best at understanding where clari­
fication and further discussion is needed or where and how focus may 
need to shift during the conversation to be most effective. A facilitator, 
particularly one not familiar with the design decisions made or the 
everyday workings of the project, might not be able to pick up on when 
something that is useful has been shared, or how to guide reactive or 
directive feedback to a place of being useful.

 5. Facilitating Critique   |  135
This can create a lot of back and forth between the designer and the 
facilitator during the session. As a team becomes more comfortable 
with the critique process, it’s advisable that they take on the facilitation 
responsibilities themselves.
HAVING THE DESIGNER PRESENT
It’s not uncommon to encounter situations in which feedback is being 
collected and delivered when the designer isn’t present. This often 
happens if the designs have been emailed around or a team member 
solicits feedback from other team members without the designer being 
involved. You’ve probably encountered this: designs are presented, 
maybe in a meeting or in an email, and the team is asked to follow up 
in a few days with their feedback. When that feedback begins coming 
in, there is some trouble deciphering it, and lengthy, difficult-to-follow 
email chains begin passing around the group. Sometimes, these can 
go on for days. Or, maybe a new meeting is scheduled to review all of 
the feedback, basically making all of the back and forth emails a waste 
anyway.
Whenever possible, critiques should include the designer and should 
be done via real-time conversation. If the designer is not present, other 
team members are forced to make assumptions about why the designer 
chose a certain line of thinking and made certain decisions. And using 
tools such as email inhibits a team’s ability for clear dialogue.
“If the designer were here I could ask her questions, but she isn’t, so I 
just have to guess at what she was trying to accomplish.”
“I think my critique is right but I have no way to know, because the 
designer isn’t here to tell me what her goals were or the problems she’s 
trying to solve.”
When critique sessions are held and the designer isn’t present, it puts 
both the person giving critique and the person receiving critique at 
a disadvantage. All the insights shared are based on assumptions, 
which is a shaky foundation upon which to base our iterations and 
improvement.

136  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Nevertheless, it’s important to recognize that there will be situations 
in which having the designer present won’t be possible. When provid­
ing feedback under these circumstances it is best to note in your feed­
back the assumption that is being made so that the designer can first 
identify whether it matches with her actual objectives. This means that 
there might be some wasted feedback, but that is one of the trade-offs 
when conducting critiques in this manner.
Central Idea
To keep a critique on track and effective, we need to be able to react and 
respond to situations as they arise. Familiarize yourself with a variety of 
techniques and the situation they best fit so that you’re prepared to handle 
whatever comes up.
Collecting Critique and Doing Something with It
Getting people talking about a design is great, but it doesn’t mean 
much if what’s discussed isn’t used to improve the design. After the 
discussion is finished, we need to have a plan for what we’ll do with 
what has been collected.
Following up a critique is crucial to keeping things moving forward. 
Critique is an active, living dialogue that lasts the lifespan of a product. 
Here are some tips on how to follow up in a way that keeps the conver­
sation moving in a productive manner:
SHARE THE NOTES AND THE DESIGN THAT WAS ANALYZED 
(IF YOU HADN’T ALREADY)
Remember that notes should be taken publicly so that everyone can 
see what’s being captured during the critique. It would be odd for the 
designer to take those away and keep them for himself.
Those notes can be of use to the entire team as they work on their 
respective parts of the project. They’re also useful in future conversa­
tions as a way to refer back and refresh people’s memories about what 
was discussed.

 5. Facilitating Critique   |  137
DOCUMENT ANY OPEN QUESTIONS AND 
PLANS TO GET THEM ANSWERED
Using the notes from the session, pull out and create a separate list of 
any open questions or assumptions that need to be looked into further.
For example, if you’re working on an application for handling insurance 
claims, you might find that during critique you identify an assumption 
such as, “We’re assuming that business rules require that we have all of 
the requested information from a customer before a claim is filed and 
begins to be processed.”
Calling out assumptions like this is important. You might not have 
someone in the conversation who can immediately verify whether the 
assumption is true. Sometimes, an unknown like this will be so signif­
icant that it’s best to wait and get clarification before making a decision 
on changes related to it.
However, that’s not where things end. After the critique, it’s import­
ant that the team follows up on these assumptions and questions. Take 
the time to list them, share them with the team, and, if applicable, 
assign any responsibilities to team members for following up on spe­
cific items.
This is something that you can share via email or in something like 
Basecamp, where everyone involved can refer to them. This is help­
ful for keeping communication going and verifying that nothing slips 
through the cracks.
REVIEW THE FINDINGS
As the designer or part of the design team, the next step is to look over 
what was discussed to determine how it will be used or acted upon. 
People will have their own approaches to exactly how they do this, but 
here is Adam’s:
1.	 Go through and fix any minor “quick hits,” that is, typos, copy-
paste errors, and small alignment issues.
2.	 Create a to-do list by reorganizing the notes and framing insights 
as actions. For example, a note such as, “The news feed is too 
prominent, because…” would be changed to, “Explore options for 
decreasing the prominence of the newsfeed….”

138  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
3.	Go through the to-do list and try to organize it in some sort of loose 
priority. To be quite honest, there is no formula for this; it changes 
a little with every project depending on the team, culture, timeline, 
and so on. Here are the kinds of things I consider:
{
{ Relevancy of the feedback to the product’s objectives. The more 
of the product’s scenarios, personas, goals, and principles that 
the feedback is applicable to, the higher its priority.
{
{ Immediacy of the feedback. Based on the timeline and proj­
ect plan, if there are certain aspects of the product that need 
to be addressed sooner than others, perhaps because they’re 
planned to be developed or released sooner, those receive 
higher priority.
{
{ Amount of agreement. Thinking about the participants, I con­
sider how many people shared the same perspective. Typically, 
the more people who agree on something, the higher priority 
that something receives.
{
{ Source of the feedback. I also consider who the feedback came 
from and that individual’s knowledge and expertise. If it’s par­
ticularly relevant to the feedback, perhaps because they’re a 
subject matter expert, that can shift the priority.
(As Adam says, this is completely unscientific.)
4.	 Go through and, using the priority, determine which items won’t 
be addressed. Remember that just because something is said in a 
critique does not mean that something will change in the design 
as a result of it. For those items that won’t be addressed, I note why, 
because I need to be ready to answer why it wasn’t changed when 
it comes up in future discussions.
I now have a to-do list that I can use with the team to iterate on the 
design.
FOLLOW UP WITH THE TEAM
After the critique is over, send an email to the participants thanking 
them for their involvement, laying out next steps, and specifying when 
the next session will be held and what will be covered in that session. 
If some of this information is still to be determined, it is OK to send 
updates when it is confirmed.

 5. Facilitating Critique   |  139
Also, let people know that you’ll be following up with them to explore 
specific feedback and ideas further or to answer open questions. Set up 
times for additional conversations or collaborative activities.
These follow-ons are also effective in working through individual feed­
back that might be too vague or too complex. Whereas in a critique ses­
sion there isn’t time to unpack every detail of the feedback and explore 
solutions, following up with individuals provides the opportunity to 
dig deeper.
The key in all of this is to keep the momentum going.
Central Idea
Critique is a living process that continues through the life of a product. 
Follow up after sessions with next steps, insights gathered during the ses-
sion, and outstanding questions to keep momentum moving forward and 
the process alive.
Wrapping Up
Facilitation is critical to the success of a critique. We must have a plan 
for what we want to discuss and understand as well as tools and struc­
ture that help us keep conversations moving in the right direction.
Some basic rules help us set up a critique and keep it focused and 
useful:
•	 Everyone is equal
•	 Everyone participates
•	 Avoid problem solving
•	 Don’t rush to make decisions
Rules set the foundation, but how do we get ready for and start a cri­
tique discussion? If we aren’t prepared and don‘t help our teammates 
and clients to be prepared, we are setting them up to provide us reac­
tionary feedback. Making sure everyone understands what the focus of 
the critique is and has the materials needed is crucial:
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

140  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
•	 Choose who is best to include. Good insights can come from 
anywhere, not just the design team, so think about inviting a 
cross-functional group.
•	 Let people know how the session will be run. Let people know how 
you plan to run the session and collect their feedback.
•	 Avoid “Ta-da!” moments. Showing people a design and expecting 
them to be able to immediately give you useful, actionable feed­
back doesn’t work.
•	 Describe objectives. People need to know what the design is trying 
to accomplish. Remind everyone so that participants are all on the 
same page.
•	 Present quickly and efficiently. Don’t become bogged down explain­
ing every detail of the design.
•	 Be careful when talking about constraints. Including them as part 
of your initial presentation can seem like you’re making excuses. 
Let the issue of constraints come up through questions.
With the critique off and running, we need tools to help us facilitate the 
conversation as it develops:
•	 Critique scope and goals. Set the context and boundaries for the 
conversation. If the discussion begins to fall outside of your limits, 
by having these explicitly set, you can steer the conversation back 
within them.
•	 Active listening. Repeating back an insight or observation as you’ve 
understood it so that someone can confirm if your understanding 
matches the intent of that person.
•	 Simple structures. Formats such as Round Robin or Quotas can 
ease some apprehension and give people a predictable structure 
within which to work.

 5. Facilitating Critique   |  141
•	 Direct inquiry. Asking questions of people directly ensures that 
you take advantage of their expertise and experience with a topic.
•	 Thinking hats/lenses. Focus the conversation on a single aspect or 
angle at one time.
•	 Notes. Take notes publicly so that participants can verify that what 
is being captured matches what they’re trying to say.
•	 Facilitators. Use a third party to manage the flow of the conversa­
tion. Although this can be helpful at first, as a team gains experi­
ence, it’s better that it take on this role.
Nothing kills a great critique like poor follow-through. Be sure to use 
the insights you gather effectively and keep the momentum going.
•	 Share the notes and any open questions or assumptions that came 
up during the discussion.
•	 Review the findings and determine how to act on them.
•	 Follow up with people for further discussions or to explore ideas 
as you iterate.
There are a lot of tools and techniques in this chapter; some might 
work for you and some might not. The key is to get started, use the tools 
you think will work, critique how things went, make adjustments, and 
then try again.

Critiquing with Difficult People 
and Challenging Situations
We work in diverse settings; our teams are made up of people with 
different skillsets, backgrounds, experience levels, and approaches to 
building products. Diversity is an important aspect in creative collabo­
ration. These differences between teammates means that we can draw 
inspiration from a wider array of possibilities; we have more material 
with which to build connections, increasing our chances of finding 
new, innovative solutions to the challenges we’re trying to solve.
Yet, bringing people together in this way also means we need to be 
aware of and prepared for the challenges that are bound to arise. Take 
a group of individuals, put them together, and give them problems 
to solve, constraints, and deadlines, and it becomes inevitable that 
we will run into situations in which communication becomes a bit 
rough. Team members will disagree or people will misunderstand one 
another while discussing their ideas and designs, sometimes making 
things uncomfortable and slowing down the task to which you’ve been 
assigned.
This is perfectly normal. In no way does the presence of these chal­
lenges mean that we should cease collaborating. The fact of the matter 
is that regardless of how much effort we put into setting up conver­
sations and critiques the right way, there will be situations for which 
things simply don’t go according to plan. Occasionally, there will be 
people who don’t participate in a productive manner for any number 
of reasons.
When these situations arise, the key is to identify where or when it is 
happening, identify the source, and work to understand what the indi­
vidual(s) is trying to communicate.

144  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Chapter 5 looks at some key techniques and best practices for facilitat­
ing these discussions, whether they are with our teams or with clients, 
and discusses focusing feedback on critique in order to produce anal­
ysis that’s useful to moving a design forward. But the question still 
looms, “What do I do when others don’t follow these suggestions or 
best practices?”
We might ask for critique and instead receive a list of requested changes. 
Or, we might get back a description or drawing of the solution that 
someone else thinks we should have come up with. We might get com­
ments like, “This is horrible” or “Great work!” that leave us with very 
little understanding as to whether our designs might actually meet our 
objectives. And, we can expect that at some point in our careers as sure 
as the sky is blue we will encounter someone with whom it is just plain 
difficult to converse.
It should be noted that not every person providing less-than-useful feed­
back is doing so with underhanded, world-domination driven motives. 
Some individuals are trying to be helpful but are going about it the 
wrong way. For most situations, we’ve found that although our initial 
reaction to these situations might be negative or defensive, it’s import­
ant to recognize that the feedback we receive from others might be 
founded in something that’s worthwhile to understand. Even though 
we can’t stop unclear or negative criticisms, we can change our per­
spective and try to find something of value in them.
Central Idea
There are going to be times when conversations and situations become 
challenging for a variety of reasons. Be prepared for them and don’t lose 
heart. Understanding the situation you’re in is the first step to forming a 
plan to work through these challenges.
Dealing with Difficult People
Certainly, we’d all prefer not to work with “difficult people,” but they 
can’t always be avoided. Some might be difficult because they’re quiet 
and difficult to extract information from. Some can be difficult because 
it’s not easy for them to communicate the points they’re trying to get

across. Others might be difficult because they have attitudes, inten­
tions, or motivations that don’t align with the principles of good cri­
tique or collaboration.
Whatever the reason, having tactics for working with and getting use­
ful feedback from people like this is important.
SETTING THE RIGHT EXPECTATIONS
Sometimes, difficulties arise when people have different expectations 
about what they’re being asked to do or how to do it. Addressing this 
is pretty straightforward. As is discussed in Chapter 5, making sure 
participants are aware of the format of the critique and how you plan to 
facilitate it is important in and of itself. It becomes even more import­
ant for situations in which we think some participants might present 
challenges.
It might seem a bit like overkill, but prefacing critiques like this can 
be truly helpful when participants or exchanges become challenging. 
Specifying the rules, structure, and focus for the critique at the outset 
can act as a preventative measure by encouraging people to pay more 
attention to how they participate and contribute to the critique.
Additionally, by communicating the rules of critique and specifying 
what we plan to focus our conversation on (see Chapter 5) ahead of 
time or at the beginning of the meeting, we have something to refer 
back to if during the course of the critique someone begins straying 
outside the rules or focus. As a facilitator, this strengthens our ability 
to address challenges as they arise and, by extension, keep critiques a 
safe, comfortable environment for our teams to discuss their designs 
and perspectives.
Along these lines, as we’ve mentioned before, posting the rules for cri­
tique in the meeting invite and the meeting room itself so that team 
members can become familiar with them and refer to them easily is 
very helpful, as is posting or documenting the specific goals and focus 
of the conversation.
AVOIDING PERSONAL PREFERENCES AND MOTIVATIONS
As discussed in Chapter 3, many project teams and organizations that 
have trouble collecting useful feedback suffer from not having a com­
mon foundation, a set of decisions that frame and form the objectives 
of the product.

146  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Having an agreed upon and mutually understood set of goals, princi­
ples, personas, and scenarios not only provides for more useful and rel­
evant critique, it also serves as a great tool for refocusing conversations 
on the product and away from criticism that is rooted in personal pref­
erence or misaligned motivations.
Depending on the details of the critique we receive, we can ask the indi­
vidual to frame it in relation to a goal, scenario, principle, or persona. 
For example, consider the following dialogue:
Critic: There are too many things to click on this screen! I think we 
should move some to other screens. It’s too confusing.
Designer: OK. Can you tell me a little more about your concern? Is 
there a particular persona or scenario that this is likely to be problem­
atic for?
Critic: Any of them. There’s just too much… I dunno, maybe the service 
rep. If I was a service rep on a call with a customer I wouldn’t be able to 
find what I need to click on with all of these options.
Designer: Great. Let’s think more about that. We know that when a call 
comes in, CSRs are trying to handle the customer’s request as quickly 
as they can. And part of the issue in the current scenario is that the 
options they need are buried within too many different screens.
Critic: Yes, but there’s just so much going on here. I’m concerned they 
won’t know where to click.
Designer: OK, so it sounds like you want to make sure that the options 
are well organized so that CSRs can find them as quickly as possible. 
Is that accurate?
In this example, by pulling in the foundational elements of the CSR 
persona and information from a scenario involving their use of the 
screen being discussed, we’re able to take what might start off seem­
ing like personal opinion and bring it to a concern that we can fur­
ther discuss in the critique and, if relevant, work to address in the next 
iteration.
This also highlights the importance of knowing about our product’s 
users and their needs, behaviors, and so on. Having solid, relevant 
research that we can reference is a great way to make sure your cri­
tiques stay grounded.

Central Idea
Addressing difficulties that come up during the course of a conversation 
entails being able to identify issues and having tools to address them. 
Setting up conversations with shared references such as rules, objectives, 
focus, and so on provides a foundation for us to use throughout the critique.
PREVENTING SURPRISES FROM QUIET PARTICIPANTS
Why can quiet people be difficult? Because sometimes they’re a ticking 
time bomb.
OK, maybe that’s a bit alarmist, but we’ve seen quiet people be prob­
lematic on more than one occasion. Sometimes, these individuals have 
something valuable to share, but for any number of reasons they don’t 
share it during the session or even with you at all. There are times 
when this silence is a result of someone feeling overwhelmed by the 
process and subject matter. Other times it mght be because they are 
afraid to provide information that might be considered “wrong.”
Instead, they share it with someone else, perhaps another teammate or 
a manager, and then the comment travels person to person until finally 
making its way back to you, days or even weeks later when you might 
no longer be able to act upon it.
When collecting feedback in a meeting, look for people who are not say­
ing much. Take steps to ensure that they have opportunities to share 
their thoughts by asking them for feedback, directly if necessary, and 
try to make them feel more comfortable. It can be useful to frame the 
feedback request as something relevant to their specific expertise or 
skillset.
Be cautious, though: you don’t want to overwhelm people by continu­
ously putting pressure on them to contribute. If you get the sense that 
an individual just hasn’t found something useful to say, leave it at that. 
It could be that they’re just quiet or shy, and your best approach could 
be to try to talk with the person one on one after the session.

USING LADDERING TO EXPAND ON FEEDBACK
Ever hung out with a child around the age of 3 to 6? If so, then you 
know what it’s like to be asked the question “Why?” over and over 
again. Children often do this when trying to get adults to explain chal­
lenging concepts to them.
The repeated asking of the question “Why?” can be used to help an 
individual to gradually get more specific or provide more details about 
a subject. Laddering, a technique commonly used in design research, 
uses the repeated asking of “Why?” in various forms to understand 
the cause or rationale behind a statement made by an interview par­
ticipant. Specifically, with each answer the individual provides, we 
respond with a form of the question “Why?” as a way to get him to pro­
vide more information until we reach a logical stopping point. A simi­
lar method, called the “5 Whys,” is often used in projects to determine 
the root cause of a problem to be solved.
This same basic technique can be applied in design discussions when 
we want to understand more about the feedback someone is giving and 
why they’re giving it. This is especially helpful when someone provides 
feedback that we sense may be related to her personal preference. By 
asking her “Why?” progressively, we’re likely to get one of two potential 
results:
•	 As we continue to ask questions about the feedback she has shared, 
we will uncover details about what she is trying to communicate in 
a way that ties back to the objectives of the product. Or…
•	 We may lead her to realize that her feedback is based more on her 
personal preference and motivations rather than the objectives of 
the product and therefore it should be left alone and the conversa­
tion can move on.
For example:
Stakeholder: I think we should use less blue in the design. 
Designer: What is it about the design that is leading you to think that?
Stakeholder: It’s too much. If I squint my eyes, blue is the dominant 
color.

 6. Critiquing with Difficult People and Challenging Situations   |  149
Designer: Why is it important that blue not be the dominant color in 
the design?
Stakeholder: We’re trying to stand out from our competitors, and 
almost all of their sites are some shade of blue.
The way you ask “Why?” is very important to the success of this tech­
nique. In some situations the simple question of “Why?” can be seen as 
interpreted as aggressive or accusatory, and that sense can become sig­
nificantly stronger with repetition. So it’s recommended that you work 
toward wording your why’s in a way that is more akin to an invite for 
the individual to continue sharing. 
ATTEMPTING DIFFERENT DYNAMICS: ONE-ON-ONE 
CONVERSATION
People’s behaviors and attitudes in a conversation can change depend­
ing on the size of the group conversing as well as the people who make 
up the group. Sometimes, it’s these factors that are the cause for some­
one to be difficult to work with in a feedback discussion.
People can become uncomfortable or intimidated by large groups or a 
subject matter (design) with which they are not very familiar, so they 
withdraw. Others might try to dominate a conversation. Some peo­
ple will have strong or combative personalities and become disruptive 
during critiques. As you work with your teams and clients, observe 
how they communicate and interact with others and make note of any 
concerns so that you are aware of them before you get into a meeting 
or critique with them.
Adam and I have found that in cases for which you know or suspect 
someone might have these kinds of challenges—they might have diffi­
culty speaking up in groups, or they can be intimidating to a fair num­
ber of team members, preventing them from speaking up—reaching 
out to these individuals in advance to analyze the work with them alone 
and collect their feedback can prevent tough situations during the 
group critique.

150  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
First, by talking with them prior to the meeting, we will have already 
discussed the designs, which for individuals who have a tendency to 
intimidate others can lead them to not be as vocal during the meet­
ing. This is because they have already provided insights, which can 
preclude opportunities for them to be difficult or disruptive during a 
session. Alternatively, if they do become challenging in the critique, we 
can refer back to the feedback and any agreements from your prior con­
versation with them and keep them accountable to those commitments.
We have also found that talking to these types of participants in 
advance can often make them feel that they have received your atten­
tion and have been heard. As a result, they sometimes feel that they can 
then forego attending the group critique, which can be helpful if their 
presence might have hindered other participants from giving useful 
feedback.
Central Idea
To deal with issues that can come up in a critique, you need to know what 
kinds of questions to ask as well as knowing when to ask them, even if that 
means doing it as part of a separate discussion.
Coping with Challenging Situations
Difficult people can show up at any time in any environment. We’ve 
already talked about some strategies for working with them, but hope­
fully, as you read the previous sections and thought about your own 
experiences, you’ve realized that in many cases, it isn’t the person 
themselves that is inherently difficult, it’s the situation or the way in 
which certain individuals deliver their feedback.
Here are some common situations that we’ve observed in the organi­
zations we’ve worked with and some techniques for working through 
them.

CRITIQUING THE WORK OF SOMEONE AVERSE TO CRITICISM
Sometimes, the difficult situation lies not in receiving feedback, but 
giving it. As we know and have discussed, receiving feedback can be 
hard to do without taking it personally. Some people will take it better 
than others.
If we know that the individual whose work we need to analyze has trou­
ble with receiving critique because they tend to get defensive or feel 
defeated, how do we go about making it easier for her? We don’t want 
to hold back our comments. We need to be truthful. But we also need 
to show tact to keep the momentum and collaborative spirit of the team 
going.
Chapter 2 shares advice for giving critique, but here are some more 
thoughts when the person you’re giving that critique to is particularly 
sensitive to feedback.
Get them talking
Engage them. Get them talking about the design, about the objec­
tives of the product and the elements or aspects of the design that are 
intended to achieve those objectives. For some people, receiving feed­
back can cause them to freeze up or go silent. Get them talking and 
thinking critically about the work with you. Ask questions. Keep it 
casual and conversational.
As they talk more, most people tend to relax. As you ask questions and 
they work to describe the design and provide more details, they’ll likely 
begin to analyze the design and participate in the critique not just as 
a recipient, but as a critic as well, which tends to make them more 
receptive. 
Talk about the work, not the person
With people who are particularly sensitive to feedback, it’s even more 
important to ensure that the conversation you have and the language 
you use center on the design and not the designer (see Figure 6-1).

 6. Critiquing with Difficult People and Challenging Situations   |  153
This can be tricky. In critiques we want to make sure that the discus­
sion includes the thoughts and reasoning people used when making 
design decisions. However, the more our questions seem to be about 
the designer, the more individuals who are sensitive to feedback can 
feel like the feedback is about them and not the design.
Emphasize that the critique is about iteration
When you’re sensitive to feedback, it can be easy to forget that critique 
is about iteration and that the reason for critiquing work is because you 
plan to continue working on a design and use the insights taken from 
the critique to make it stronger.
Remind the recipient of this if you can during the feedback. Let him 
know that you’re curious to see what he comes back with in the next 
iteration. If you’ve critiqued this work with him in the past, talk about 
how things have improved over the past iterations.
The sandwich method
The sandwich method is an often-talked-about method for delivering 
negative feedback in management circles. In it, you begin by present­
ing a piece of positive feedback, followed by the negative feedback you 
have, followed by another piece of positive feedback.
The idea is that by starting off positive you give the recipient a sense 
of success and support, so that when he receives the negative feedback 
you’re about to follow up with, he doesn’t feel as bad about it and his 
emotions don’t fall as far. Then, another piece of positive feedback lifts 
his emotions again and, because there was more positive than negative, 
he feels like he’s leaving with the scales tipped in a positive direction.
For as much anecdotal support as there is for the sandwich method, 
there is also a lot of criticism and skepticism as well as research that 
it doesn’t work, mostly because of how it’s often carried out. In many 
cases, the positive comments are superficial and or vague (Figure 6-2). 
They might be about a quality that has very little to do with what’s 
being discussed, or about no strength at all really.
Most people can see right through these kinds of comments and they 
do little to help the situation. The initial praise or positive comment 
does little more than signal that something bad is coming. Additionally, 
because cognitively we expend more energy and attention processing

154  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
negative situations than positive ones, initial positive comments are 
forgotten as soon as negative comments are brought in. And for some, 
the whole method can feel manipulative.
FIGURE 6-2
An example of a bad feedback sandwich
We strongly believe that balancing conversation around strengths and 
weaknesses of a design is important in a critique. And we agree that 
starting off on a positive note can be helpful in setting tone.
Most important though, is that the positive comments be about real 
strengths in the design (Figure 6-3); they should be aspects that we 
have thought about critically and feel are effective and important to the 
objectives of the project, not just things we came up with at the spur of 
the moment to make a weakness we want to point out easier to handle.
Don’t worry about the “sandwich”. Be honest with the recipient. Balance 
the conversation. Think critically about and discuss the elements of the 
design that work for and against objectives. And don’t manipulate or 
make up insights and feedback just to try and make things easier.

RECEIVING UNSOLICITED FEEDBACK
If feedback only ever happened when we ask for it, would it ever hap­
pen at all? The truth is feedback happens all the time whether we ask 
for it or not. Sometimes, it’s conscious feedback, someone deliberately 
responding to something we’ve done by making comments or sugges­
tions or asking questions. Sometimes it’s subconscious. We might cre­
ate or do something and notice a subtle change in someone’s demeanor 
or behavior, or maybe a facial expression.

156  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Feedback is a regularly occurring and natural part of our interactions 
with others. Whether we’re solo creators or part of a team creating 
something, if we set a goal of wanting to improve our creations, we 
need to understand that feedback is constantly happening outside the 
situations in which we’ve requested it. It’s up to us to recognize when 
feedback is occurring, work to understand what that feedback is telling 
us, and determine if it is useful in our work and whether we should pay 
attention to it.
Step 1: Be ready
Understanding that feedback occurs so frequently and naturally, it’s 
best that we be proactive in thinking about how we want to handle it. 
Before sharing your work, even if you have no plans to ask for it, think 
about how you want to handle feedback. Spending a little time think­
ing about how you’ll respond to compliments, questions, and critique 
can go a long way, not only toward making those exchanges much more 
useful to you as you iterate on your work, but also to helping you learn 
how to separate yourself from your work.
Separating yourself from your work can be difficult. You’ve put time 
and energy into what everyone else is now going to analyze with a crit­
ical eye. It’s intimidating. One thing that has helped Adam and me to 
create this separation is remembering that critique is a tool that can 
help us produce better work. The focus of the critique is the product, 
not the person who created the work. If there is feedback that some­
thing missed the mark, it is OK, and the chances are pretty good that 
I am still an upstanding person. Critique is not about judgment, it is 
about refinement.
Step 2: Hold on to your reaction
When unsolicited feedback to something you’ve created or presented 
occurs—it might be verbal (someone saying or writing something) or 
physical (a physical gesture via body language or facial expression)—
the first thing to do is to hold back your initial reaction. It’s inevitable 
that we’ll have a reaction, and the more passionate or pronounced the 
feedback is to which we’re reacting, the stronger our reaction is likely 
to be.

WWW.EBOOK777.COM

 6. Critiquing with Difficult People and Challenging Situations   |  157
What we need to do is give ourselves time to process the feedback and 
decide what we want to do with it. Do we want to learn more about why 
someone feels the way they do about the design? Would knowing it be 
useful to us in improving the design? Are we in a position where we 
could use that information?
Keep in mind that this applies for both positive and negative feedback. 
Even though feedback is positive, it might not be helpful. Someone say­
ing, “I like this” might make us feel good, but the question remains, 
what does he like? People will often offer positive feedback because 
they don’t want to hurt someone’s feelings, not necessarily because 
they think the work is heading in the right direction. With all feedback, 
the best approach is to thank the individual for his feedback, be sure 
that you understand what he is communicating, review his feedback 
in light of what your known objectives are, and then follow up with 
questions.
Step 3: Consider the source and intent
What kind of feedback is it? Is it reaction, direction, or critique? Is it 
constructive or destructive? (We’ll talk a bit more specifically about 
working with reactive and directive feedback in the next two sections.) 
If we can get a read on what type of feedback we’re starting with, we can 
get a better sense of how to dig deeper to get something of value from 
it. The key question to ask though is “Why?” Asking “Why?” engages 
the critic and prompts her to explain and even rationalize her state­
ments. Even feedback that might seem initially destructive can have 
some legitimate analysis behind it.
This doesn’t mean that you should always engage with someone who 
is tearing your work apart. You should think about the source itself. If 
this is someone with a history of being a problem and you can ignore 
her comments, you probably should. But it might be someone who has 
something worthwhile to tell you and is just having some difficulty 
moving past that initial reactionary phase of feedback. Asking “Why?” 
often helps us see if this is the case.

158  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
You should also consider the view from which her feedback is coming. 
Is she speaking as a representative of the audience for whom you’ve cre­
ated the design? Does she have expertise in a particular aspect touched 
upon by your creation? Or maybe she’s just insightful? Again, the ques­
tion “Why?” can help us determine the lens being used to derive the 
feedback we’re receiving, making it possible for us to determine if we 
should pay attention to it in our next iteration or not.
Step 4: Listen, understand, and use it
If you’ve determined that the feedback might have something of use to 
it, you’re next job is to listen. Pay attention. Be sure you really under­
stand what you’re being told. Use active listening and question for clar­
ity by repeating back what you’ve heard but worded differently.
And finally, just as with any solicited critique, you can factor these new 
insights into your next iteration—assuming that you’ve determined 
they’re applicable.
DEALING WITH REACTIVE FEEDBACK
Well… it’s better than peanut butter and salami!
No kidding, Adam actually witnessed that feedback in a meeting. After 
an awkward WTF moment in everyone’s heads as they looked around 
the room at each other and wondered what a comment like that could 
possibly mean, the team learned that it definitely wasn’t positive. It 
roughly translated to, “It’s not the most heinous thing I’ve ever seen, 
but it’s close.”
This kind of feedback is bound to happen at some point in time. It 
might not be as extreme as a noxious combination of sandwich fillings. 
You might just get a “meh” or maybe something on the positive side 
like, “I love it!”
Remember that reactionary feedback comes from the more impulsive 
of our mental processes. It can be positive or negative, and it can come 
from one of a few different causes, as described in Chapter 1.
In general, though, this type of feedback is the result of an individual 
expressing a gut reaction to what they are seeing. They haven’t taken 
the time to think critically, moving past that initial reaction to examine 
it and uncover the cause for it.

WWW.EBOOK777.COM

 6. Critiquing with Difficult People and Challenging Situations   |  159
And, as we’ve described, this kind of feedback isn’t very useful to us as 
we work toward iterating and improving our creation. It doesn’t tell us 
what aspects of our creation will or will not work to achieve our objec­
tives. Therefore, it doesn’t help us identify which aspects of our cre­
ation should be changed, explored further, or expanded upon.
There is, of course, the possibility that the critic is just being difficult or 
their personality makes it challenging to work with them. In this case, 
it is natural to want to tell someone to kick rocks. Although this can 
bring some temporary gratification, it usually only complicates matters 
in the end. It’s natural to grow defensive when criticism is coming our 
way; we must resist that urge and focus on the best solution.
As with unsolicited feedback, sometimes people aren’t being trolls and 
might actually have valuable insights. Look to find the balance between 
not feeding the trolls and not becoming defensive, and collecting infor­
mation that might be useful as you iterate on your design.
The only way to get someone to move past the reactionary phase of 
feedback is to ask questions that push him to examine not only his reac­
tion, but also the creation you’re asking them to analyze. Remember, at 
this point he’s really only just reacted. His slower, more analytical cog­
nitive processes that facilitate critical thinking haven’t taken over yet. 
By asking questions, we can help ensure that they do. By asking ques­
tions, we can work toward exposing and understanding what it is that 
led the individual to give his reaction. As we converse and try to gather 
insights, we can then begin to determine if the individual is trying to 
be helpful and maybe just going about it the wrong way or if he is troll­
ing or voicing an opinion with no real desire to help.
It’s also important as you move through this process to pay attention 
to how you word your questions. It’s important to try to word things in 
such a way that they aren’t misconstrued as defensive and adversarial. 
Instead, you’re looking to invite the individual to provide you with more 
of his thinking.
Step 1: Get more specific
The first question to ask is pretty straightforward: 
Can you tell me a bit more about what aspects of the design aren’t 
working?
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
160  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Of course you’ll reword this depending on the specific reaction you’ve 
received. The key point is to try to get her to be more specific. Get her 
to focus on specific aspects or elements of the creation to which she is 
reacting. This way, you can better focus the rest of the conversation by 
discussing those aspects specifically, or perhaps the part of the design 
that you’re interested in gathering feedback on is different from what 
she’s reacting to, and so you can now try to steer her toward only paying 
attention to that part of the design.
Step 2: Talk about the “whys” and “hows”
Presuming that you’re digging deeper into the critic’s reaction (as 
opposed to discovering that she’s reacting to something irrelevant to 
what we’re trying to collect feedback on and refocusing the conversa­
tion) the next step is to understand the following:
•	 Why is/are the aspect(s) she is reacting to terrible?
•	 How does that relate to the objectives of the design itself?
This is where having a solid foundation really matters. If the team has 
already agreed upon things such as personas, goals, principles, and 
scenarios, you can ask people to relate their feedback to those founda­
tional elements.
By uncovering this information, you can begin to get to the core of 
what the individual’s problem with the design might be. Adam and I 
have found that, oftentimes, using this approach you, together with the 
critic, will be able uncover whether the feedback being given is perti­
nent or a matter of the critic’s personal preference or motivations. By 
doing so, you help the critic understand the process of critical thinking 
so that in the future she’s better able to give critique.
It isn’t easy to discern what someone’s motivations are. How she 
responds to the questions will help in understanding if she really is try­
ing to help and just having a hard time communicating, or if she has 
other motivations.
One way to work through these difficulties is to reinforce and remind 
her that you are on the same team and working together. Use phrases 
such as, “I need your help to better understand” or “We really want 
to make sure this product meets its goals, and your help is crucial in 
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

 6. Critiquing with Difficult People and Challenging Situations   |  161
accomplishing that.” By doing this we can move away from a me-ver­
sus-you situation and put the focus on working together as a team to 
resolve differences and focus on the needs of the products.
Most, but not all, individuals will be cooperative in these situations and 
in those few cases of individuals who aren’t, it is best to move on. If 
someone is nonresponsive to your attempts to reach out for clarification 
or he does not get any less difficult as the conversation progresses, this 
is probably a sign that you will not be able to make much progress with 
this person, and it will not be worth the time following up with him. In 
these cases, it is OK to thank the person for his insights and move on, 
focusing on collecting helpful insights on another topic or from others. 
Take note of how this person interacted so that you know what to expect 
from him in the future. In some cases, it might mean that you go about 
collecting his feedback in another way. In others, in which the individ­
ual is not a part of the project, it may mean that you exclude him from 
future critiques.
In the end, we should strive to see if we can get any information that 
can be used to improve the design by using some of the tips and tech­
niques for facilitating critique we talk about in Chapter 5, even if we 
don’t fully agree with an individual’s overall assessment. Although it is 
not ideal when an individual’s intent is not coming from a position of 
trying to be helpful, we can make the best of the situation by objectively 
analyzing the feedback he is providing, looking for anything useful.
Remember, this applies to positive feedback as well
When talking about feedback and criticism, it’s easy to fixate on the 
negative. When we think about problems with getting feedback, that’s 
where our minds instinctively go: to all the times when someone has 
berated us and told us our work is awful. Or, if it hasn’t happened yet, 
we are consumed by the anticipation that it will one day, and what will 
we do then.
Nonetheless, we need to remember that reactionary feedback can be 
positive, too, even neutral. In these cases, even though our own reac­
tions to the feedback we’re receiving might not be so negative—it 
feels great when someone exclaims, “I love it” about something you’ve 
made—the feedback itself is still unhelpful in providing us with infor­
mation to use in iterating on and improving our creation.

162  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Thus, we still need to do our due diligence to ask questions and push 
people to think critically about our design and their reaction. What do 
they love about it? Why? How does it apply to our goals, personas, sce­
narios, and principles?
DEALING WITH DIRECTIVE FEEDBACK
Many of us have been in situations in which instead of getting what we’d 
consider to be useful feedback on our designs, we get a list of changes 
to make to it or suggestions on how we might improve it. Often, this list 
doesn’t include a clear indication of why the changes should be made. 
Beyond that, some of the changes might be things that are detrimental 
to the design and things we’d advise against.
The most challenging, and possibly most frustrating, of these kinds of 
situations is when we don’t receive actionable critique; instead, we get 
a sketch or mockup for a new design that the person we’ve asked for 
feedback has put together on her own.
We sit and stare at the screen with a million thoughts and questions 
running through our heads and often a building sense of frustration 
and insult.
How dare they!!! What do I do now?!?
Step 1: Calm down and let your reaction pass
Step back and force yourself to remember that most people are not dia­
bolical, intentionally hurtful people. You’re having a reaction right now, 
an impulse. You aren’t thinking critically just yet. Remember that most 
people are just trying to do the best job they can, and the chances are 
that this individual is not trying to insult you.
Creating her own design is not necessarily an evil act. In fact, in most of 
the situations I’ve encountered this scenario or observed other design­
ers come up against it, it’s merely due to the individual finding it dif­
ficult to articulate everything she wanted to say about the design and 
thinking it would be easier if she tried to show you.
Hmm… “Show me. Don’t tell me.” Who does that sound like?
Correct me if I’m wrong, but hasn’t the design community en masse 
used that as a kind of mantra to describe the inefficiencies we often 
encounter when trying to verbally describe things?

Similarly, getting a list of changes back as feedback might just mean 
that the individual has jumped to identifying solutions to the chal­
lenges she perceives rather than articulating those challenges back to 
you as feedback.
Of course, there is the possibility that the thinking behind the changes 
the individual is proposing might be personally motivated. The next 
steps in this process will work toward helping you identify if that is 
the case. Even if it is, it can be worth working to understand what this 
person is telling you, because you never know where a valuable insight 
might come from.
Step 2: Take note
Although she most likely isn’t trying to play the role of your archneme­
sis, this does give you some insight into what your engagement might 
be like if you continue to work with this individual, and in many cases, 
you’ll have to.
It isn’t a bad thing. Good collaboration is rarely a natural occurrence. 
It takes deliberate action and consideration from the people involved. 
Getting a sense for how people share their thoughts and ideas can help 
you tailor how you work with them and increase the efficiency of your 
communications and idea-sharing back and forth.
Moreover, in the off chance that you’re working with Satan himself, 
this might be one of your first signs…
Step 3: Critique the directive feedback
On your own, compare the contents and elements of the person’s work 
or recommended changes and ask yourself the following:
•	 How does his design differ from yours? What specific changes is 
he proposing?
•	 Why might he be proposing these changes? What is he trying to 
achieve? What problems is he trying to solve and how is he trying 
to solve them?
•	 Did you try to solve for those same problems in your design? How? 
How does your solution differ from his?
•	 If you didn’t try to solve for some of those same objectives, why 
not? Was it a deliberate omission on your part? An oversight?

164  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
•	 Looking at his proposed changes, what aspects of the design and 
its elements might he be indicating are of primary importance to 
him?
Make notes as you ask yourself these questions. But again, keep the 
notes to yourself. By doing this, you give yourself some time to step 
back and think objectively about what the individual might be trying 
to tell you.
Step 4: Critique together
Set up some time with the person who has sent you directive feedback 
to discuss the designs or list of changes. Thank her for her feedback 
and let her know that in order to refine the design you’d like to discuss 
some questions with her regarding the thinking behind the choices he 
made.
In your discussion ask about the differences you noticed between your 
design and her proposed changes and ask why he made or is recom­
mending the change. Again, what problems is he trying to solve? What 
was it about your design that she doesn’t think is sufficient to solve that 
same problem? If the solutions she’s designed are problematic in some 
way to the design or product—perhaps because they go against best 
practices or research—ask her about it.
Also, ask specifically about the things she isn’t recommending be 
changed or similarities between her design and yours. Why are they 
there? Did she keep them for the same reasons you made them?
Now, because you’re going to be trying to facilitate this discussion as 
a critique, you want to make use of any tools you have that will help. 
Earlier in the project, did you establish agreed-upon personas and sce­
narios? How about goals and design principles? (Are you all sick of us 
mentioning these yet?)
If you did, have them at the ready. These are the perfect foundation 
for your discussion. Instead of just comparing the two designs to each 
other, or your design with the critic’s list of changes, you can compare 
them in regard to all of the things that the team had previously agreed 
were important to the success of the product.
This helps remove some of the my-idea-versus-your-idea atmosphere 
that might be present and helps focus the conversation on what the 
right decisions are for the success of the product.

 6. Critiquing with Difficult People and Challenging Situations   |  165
If you don’t have these tools, this might be your opportunity to begin 
to generate some. As you discuss why he made decisions and learn 
about the aspects of the solution that are most important to him and 
his vision, you can talk about how this compares with the findings of 
any research that’s been done, and possibly, on-the-fly generate some 
principles and goals that you can use to help focus discussions as the 
project moves forward.
Now, maybe your project does have goals and principles defined, but as 
you’re going through the critique you’re finding that they really aren’t 
helping. This can be a sign that the goals and principles you set are 
too broad. Remember, when asking whether design options adhere to 
a principle, more often the answer should be “no.” If your principles 
and goals are too broad, this can be your chance to refine them through 
your discussion.
Goals should be connected to something measurable. If during the 
conversation you find in trying to critique against a particular goal that 
you have no way to meaningfully measure something to determine if 
the goal has been achieved or not, you might need to refine your goal.
In the course of your conversation, your goal is to essentially construct 
a critique of your original proposed design using your critic’s design or 
changes as a discussion tool. You should be able to learn which design 
decisions you made that don’t quite work well enough to meet desired 
objectives and aspects that are important to the product and the client 
as well as how they aren’t working. You also should have an under­
standing of the design decisions that are working.
Beyond that, if the individual you’re working with is a teammate, stake­
holder, or client, you should also be looking to come away with a bet­
ter understanding of her vision and thoughts on how specific design 
challenges might be solved. Using that knowledge, you can incorpo­
rate elements of her solutions into a revised design where they work 
and fit best without compromising the integrity of the creation just so 
that people have something to point to and say, “I came up with that.” 
Remember, a good idea can come from anywhere.
Step 5: Move forward together
Armed with a better understanding of your original proposed design 
you should now be able to iterate upon it in a way that strengthens its 
alignment with your research, design principles, and so on.

166  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Of course, you have the option of ending your discussion by sitting 
down at your desk, making your revisions, and sending your updated 
design back out for feedback. But think about it for a second, and make 
sure that ending the discussion is the right thing to do at this time.
In most of the situations we’ve seen where this comes up, particularly 
when collecting feedback from teammates, stakeholders, or clients (as 
opposed to outside individuals), this approach is repeatedly problem­
atic because it’s exactly what caused the issue in the first place. The 
designer or team came up with their proposal and sent it over in an 
email with a few sparse instructions on how the client, stakeholder, 
and others should send back their thoughts.
You’ve got some opportunities here.
One possibility is for you to set up some time with the individual(s) and 
explore some of the changes together. Work together to generate multi­
ple possibilities for a change and then refine them collaboratively. This 
gives you more insight into their thinking and gives you more opportu­
nities to help them understand the design process.
Another thing to think about is how you’ll collect feedback throughout 
the rest of the project. Not everything can be done together in real time. 
There will be times when you need to put something together and then 
get other people’s thoughts in order to make changes. We’ve always 
found it’s best to collect feedback in person (physically or remotely), 
because then we’re able to structure and facilitate the conversation 
around critique.
For the situations in which someone proposes a change, we’re imme­
diately able to ask her why and get a better understanding of what it is 
she’s trying to do. Yes, there are times when schedules are tight and 
we can’t talk about everything we need to on our call, but by beginning 
the discussion in this way, we find that the remaining feedback that is 
sent by email is often much more useful than if all we’d done to initi­
ate things was send her an email with our design and a request for her 
feedback.
If the individual is a member of your project, moving forward, consider 
reaching out to her a little earlier in the process. Share design concepts 
with her and, if appropriate, ensure that she is invited to team critiques. 
Be transparent with your design process and what you are trying to 
accomplish with your designs. Keep an open dialogue with the person.

Hopefully this will help the individual feel more comfortable commu­
nicating about designs with you and lead to more productive conver­
sations and less bulleted lists or designs in response to your designs.
Central Idea
When situations become challenging, try to steer the conversation back to 
the main concerns. Engage the person or participants with whom you are 
working by keeping the conversation centered on the product.
Wrapping Up
Any time that we are collaborating with others, there are bound to be 
communication miscues, conflict, and frustration. This is the nature 
of working with people.
We are all different with differing personalities, character traits, and 
ideas as to how things should work. We should expect that there will be 
some level of communication gaps and even conflict, but by no means 
does this mean that we should enter working relationships looking to 
be combative.
Instead, we should be aware of the possible causes for these challenges 
and arm ourselves with tactics, a bit of extra patience, and a resolve to 
keep things focused on the project and its objectives, even if they begin 
to feel personal.
In this chapter, we covered different situations that you might encoun­
ter. Here are some of the key takeaways:
•	 Not all feedback is wanted, relevant, or actionable. This is to be 
expected and we should do our best to salvage what we can from 
it, if possible.
•	 When giving feedback to someone who has difficulty receiving it, 
be considerate, focus your language on the work (not the person) 
and the iterative aspect of critique, be honest, and balance the con­
versation around strengths and weakness.
•	 Facilitating reactive or directive feedback relies heavily on a 
methodical asking of the question “Why?”
www.it-ebooks.info

168  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
•	 Ensuring that everyone involved in a group critique has an under­
standing of what useful feedback (critique) is and what the focus 
of the conversation should be on can go a long way toward keeping 
conversations efficient as well as providing tools to refocus them 
when they go astray.
•	 If someone has responded to proposed designs by sending her own 
versions of the design, take a step back and look at what she sent, 
analyze the differences between the proposed design and hers, and 
then follow up to discuss it with her. 
•	 Use preestablished artifacts such as goals, personas, scenarios, 
and principles to center conversations.
•	 If you know someone is going to be difficult or tends to be difficult 
in meetings, communicate with that person ahead of time.
Communication is at the core of critique. When things start to go awry, 
the best way to get things back on track is to refocus the conversations 
on the objectives. Putting the focus back on the product can get to the 
intent of unwanted critique or situations in which someone is being 
difficult.

Summary: Critique Is at the 
Core of Great Collaboration
We have covered many concepts discussing how to critique and improve 
the conversations surrounding design. Some of the content might have 
resonated with you, whereas other parts might seem interesting but a 
bit difficult to make use of with your teams. This is OK. Although there 
are a lot of similarities in how we work with companies, teams, and cli­
ents, there is no rubber-stamp solution to improving design conversa­
tions that will work for everyone.
Critique is not just for designers. It is not owned by design; it’s for 
anyone looking to improve whatever it is that they are developing. 
Though we mention design and designers a lot throughout the book, 
the thoughts and concepts shared in this book are equally of value to 
product owners, project managers, developers, and basically anyone 
who is working with others to create something.
Moving Beyond Feedback
Feedback is an important part of the design process; it is crucial that we 
move past the general understanding that many of us have of feedback, 
and build a shared understanding with our teams of what it means to 
the design process and how it should be used. When we begin doing 
this with our teams, we will begin to improve our conversations sur­
rounding designs, which in turn leads to better collaboration.
Feedback has three main forms: direction, reaction, and critique. 
Direction and reaction do not help us better understand the effective­
ness of aspects and elements of the design. Critique is a form of feed­
back by which we analyze a design against the objectives we have for it 
through critical thinking.

WWW.EBOOK777.COM

170  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Having a more detailed understanding of feedback and how critique 
can benefit our teams has the ability to impact so many facets of our 
design process. As we embrace the use of critique, we begin to build a 
shared vocabulary around the products we are designing, making com­
munication, collaboration, and consensus more attainable. Iteration on 
our products also becomes more effective as these other areas improve.
Understanding feedback is only the beginning; we also need to know 
how to apply feedback in conversations with those with whom we’re 
working. Observe the people, personalities, and structures of the teams 
and clients you work with to uncover what you can do to help improve 
your critiques and design conversations in the contexts in which you 
work.
As we work to understand how to best approach feedback with our 
teams, it is important that intent be the foundational component of cri­
tique. Intent can be self-focused, based on ulterior motives or personal 
agendas, or it can be product-focused, where the choices we make are 
based on what is best for the product.
Adopting Critique
These two forms of intent affect both the giving and receiving of feed­
back, and if intent is wrong on either side it can really throw a wrench 
into the works. If we can keep the focus on the product, we have a 
much better chance at collaborating better. One way we can do this is 
by using the framework and best practices we shared in Chapter 2.
By asking the questions in the framework, we are using critical think­
ing to understand how to give helpful feedback to others. Leading with 
questions helps not only show interest in someone else’s process, but it 
also helps to instigate a dialogue, which is really what critique is.
UNDERSTANDING THE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE
Understanding the culture you work in is a big part of improving cri­
tique and collaboration. Look at the culture in which you are working 
and note the areas where you think the culture will support efforts for 
improved communication and collaboration. Look also to the areas that 
are going to need some work. It is important to set realistic expecta­
tions about what you want to change for the better. Going in with guns 
blazing and no intent on being flexible probably won’t get you very far.

But, if you go in with the intent to educate those you work with and are 
willing to find a common ground, you will begin to set the foundation 
for more productive conversations.
INTEGRATING CRITIQUE WITH YOUR PROCESS
Making critique a part of your process can have challenges and might 
not work as expected on your first try, but don’t give up; continue to 
practice exchanging feedback and talking about your designs with your 
teams. Adam and I suggest using this book as a reference as you nav­
igate the waters of discussing designs and solutions with others. As 
mentioned in previous chapters, the more you critique the more you 
will become comfortable with talking about your work with others and 
receiving feedback on it. It can be intimidating when you first start out. 
Trust me, we have shared in that feeling and still do at times. Don’t be 
held back by believing you must be an expert right from the outset. It is 
a living process and as you do it more, you have the chance to improve 
how you (and your team) critique, see what works for you, what doesn’t, 
and make adjustments.
Start small, observe those you work with and see who among them 
would be open to talking about critique, and invite them to a casual 
conversation. Choose a simple setting such as lunch or coffee to open 
up the discussion and see if you can set a regular time to meet, or if they 
are open to something more spontaneous as the opportunities arise. 
The more you do this, the more comfortable you will become talking 
about your designs with others. You will also become more comfortable 
with the process of critique and using the techniques we have shared in 
this book. The more you get used to talking about your designs in the 
context of critique, invite others to participate, and educate them about 
the value of critique, collaboration, and improved communication.
FACILITATING CRITIQUE
As you work on your critique skills, it is also crucial that you make sure 
to practice facilitating critique. Facilitation is a big part of the critique 
process, serving as a guide, keeping things on track, and making it eas­
ier to gather and record feedback. Try different approaches, whether it 
is using a round-robin technique to ensure that everyone contributes, 
or quotas that help participants frame their feedback in a more under­
standable way for everyone.

172  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
Preparing for the sessions, and getting materials out to the team ahead 
of time also goes a long way; it helps set the expectations for team 
members and helps them to come prepared. Follow-up emails and 
conversations are great tools for maintaining the momentum with the 
team after a session. Facilitation provides the structure and framework 
needed to improve communication and collaboration.
Coping with Difficult Situations
The more you critique, the more likely it is that you will eventually 
encounter different situations that can be frustrating, whether it is 
difficult people or lack of facilitation in meetings. Remember, it’s not 
about judgment; it’s about improvement based on analysis. If there 
are questions or concerns about your work, don’t worry; it is a part of 
the process, and the chances are that you are still an awesome human 
being. The more we keep this in mind and focus on what will help us 
to improve the product when receiving feedback, the easier these diffi­
cult situations will be to work through. Collaboration isn’t always easy, 
but by improving how you handle feedback and communicate with oth­
ers, you can better work through these frustrating situations and still 
derive value from them.
Conversations and the people with whom we engage in them can be 
complicated. When we understand this going into them, we can pre­
pare ourselves with the tools and techniques to make the discussions 
less difficult and derive more value from them.
Keep in mind that how people respond to critique can have a lot to do 
with their personal experiences, lack of experience with it, and cul­
tural upbringing. As you work with others, listen, observe, and try to 
understand where they are coming from and what is influencing how 
they interact in these settings. As you begin to understand the various 
influencers, reach out to individuals, explain the purpose and value of 
critique, and help them feel more comfortable with the process.

We are providing you with a cheat sheet (http://www.discussingdesign.
com/downloads/Critique_CheatSheet.pdf) to have handy that sum­
marizes many of the helpful points in this book at a glance. In the 
cheat sheet we outline important things to remember about giving and 
receiving feedback, tips and techniques for facilitating critique, dealing 
with difficult situations, and making critique a part of your process. 
Besides using this cheat sheet for your own reference, you might want 
to share it with your team as a tool to use in preparation for and during 
your critique sessions. The more you do to help your team understand 
critique and help team members understand how to participate in a 
productive way, the sooner you will begin to see improvements in your 
design conversations.
Dive In
All you need to do is begin, dive in, and have a conversation with some­
one on your team or with a peer. Try to use the techniques in this 
book, see how they help shape your conversations, and see how others 
respond to them. Share, educate, and continue to push for better feed­
back, even if it is just a little bit at a time. Critique is at the core of great 
collaboration, and great collaboration brings teams together to create 
great products. Go forth, create, critique, and collaborate.

The 10 Bad Habits That Hurt Critique
Introduction
Adam and I often are asked for tips on what can be done to avoid cri­
tique sessions becoming a train wreck. This book has covered a lot of 
tips and techniques for making your critiques more productive; we 
would like to pull out a few things to keep in mind when going into a 
critique. These are things that you can work on by yourself or with your 
team. As we have mentioned, critique takes repetition, practicing the 
positive things we can do as well as training to avoid the bad habits that 
can put hurdles in the way of good communication and positive cri­
tiques. We have identified 10 common bad habits that negatively affect 
our critiques; we will give a brief definition of each so that you can have 
them as a handy reference
REACTING
Reactions in and of themselves are not bad; we all have them. In the 
context of critique, when we mention reacting as a bad habit we are 
talking about a response that has not been thought through to what 
we are seeing or hearing when someone presents a design. When we 
verbalize or act on our initial reactions without taking time to better 
understand what we are responding to and why we are having the reac­
tion we are, we put ourselves in a position to provide information that 
isn’t helpful to the presenter.
Instead of just reacting with the first thought that comes to mind (it 
doesn’t matter whether it is accurate), hold on to that thought and think 
about some questions that will help you understand what you are see­
ing and hearing better.
What are the objectives of the design? What elements relate to those 
objectives? Are they successful? Why or why not? These are all ques­
tions to think through either on your own or with the person sharing 
www.it-ebooks.info

176  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
her work. You can use the answers that you receive to compare against 
your initial reaction, and then you will find yourself in a place to offer 
informed, helpful feedback, or to keep your initial reaction to yourself.
BEING SELFISH
Giving critique isn’t about telling someone what we would have cre­
ated or manipulating situations to get our own way. And it’s not about 
demonstrating to the group how smart we might be or how great our 
ideas are. Giving critique isn’t about us at all.
But we often see individuals doing exactly these things. Offering feed­
back not on what has been designed, but instead commenting on what 
they think should have been done. This does little to help designers 
understand whether their designs will or won’t be effective, and it does 
even less to keep a team collaborating smoothly.
GETTING DEFENSIVE
It can be very common to become defensive or protective over our 
work. Our work is our passion; our blood, sweat, and tears, laid out for 
oth¬ers to just pick apart, or at least it feels that way. By focusing on 
defending our work or worrying about what we think others will think 
of us if there are imperfections in our designs (which there always will 
be), we take the focus off the product and place it squarely on us. This 
is a self-focused approach to critique and to design.
Critique is not about personal judgment; it is about analysis and 
improvement. The success of the product we are building should be 
the main focus; this means we need to keep the focus on the product by 
being willing to look at our work objectively with our teams. Analyzing 
what is working and what isn’t will help our team know what it needs 
to do to ensure that the product meets its goals.
Getting defensive over our work only puts hurdles in the way of com¬­
munication and collaboration. Explain your work, do not defend it. In 
a productive critique environment, our work is not under attack, it is 
being analyzed collectively so that the team and product can benefit 
from the insights provided.
Defending our designs can be a hard habit to get out of, but if we 
com¬mit to reminding ourselves that we are working together as 
a team to analyze and improve them, it makes it easier explain our 
design deci¬sions and gather feedback.

STARTING FROM DISPARATE FOUNDATIONS
Everyone comes into critique with their own sets of expertise, experi­
ence, and skills. This diversity in perspectives can be helpful as they 
can help provide us with diverse insights. We run into trouble when 
the core foundation underneath these expectations and ideas of what 
the product should accomplish are not aligned across team members 
and clients.
If we do not start from a common foundation of what objectives the 
product should be working toward, each individual might try to steer 
the product according to his or her own priorities. It would be like an 
Olympic rowing team trying to win a race while everyone in the boat is 
trying to row in their own direction. It’s safe to say that their chances 
of success are limited.
For teams to have productive conversations and critiques, there needs 
to be a set of agreements that underpins their unique expertise and 
perspectives, a common understanding of the core goals to unite the 
team and center the conversations surrounding design.
When agreed upon by the team, items such as product goals, personas, 
scenarios, and principles are useful in setting a solid foundation for 
collaborative activities and critiques because they provide information 
about a desired future state and the guiderails a solution should work 
within to reach it.
LACKING FOCUS
If critiques lack focus, things can go off the rails quickly and make it dif­
ficult for the team to understand and gather useful insights. Critique, 
and more important, the participants in a critique, need structure to 
help keep the conversations focused and to help them understand the 
type of feedback they should be giving and how they should be shar­
ing it.
By identifying the specifics that we want feedback on and making sure 
that the team understands them, we can avoid everyone just firing away 
feedback for any part of the design in any order they want.
Send out the plan for what you hope to accomplish during the critique 
and explain the structure that will allow the session to meet those 
goals. Share the work to be critiqued ahead of time as well as the type 
of feedback you are looking for so participants can come prepared.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

178  |   DISCUSSING DESIGN
If necessary, use basic facilitation techniques such as going around the 
room in a round-robin fashion to help keep things moving. Another 
useful technique is to use different lenses (ways and angles to look at 
things) to help draw out specific perspectives and insights.
FOCUSING ON WHAT ISN’T WORKING
So much of the time when thinking of critique, it can be easy to fall into 
the trap of only identifying what isn’t working. This line of thinking 
does not capture the entire purpose of critique. Yes, we need to identify 
what isn’t working so that we can improve upon it, but we also need to 
identify what is working to continue to pursue those solutions. If we see 
that a certain solution is working, we can possibly find use for it later in 
the project or on other projects because we know that it already works.
It is also important to find strengths in a design or solution so that 
there is balance in the critique; a good way to do this is by providing a 
structure for participants to use when giving feedback. An example of 
this would be asking each participant to identify two things they think 
are working in the solution and two things that cause concern.
LACK OF DISCUSSION
Critique is a dialog, an exploration and analysis of the solutions we are 
proposing for a certain set of problems. Critique is not a list of revisions 
to be carried out like a short-order cook.
To truly find out if a design or solution is on the right path, it is crucial 
for teams to talk about why something might or might not be working. 
If critique is a dialogue, this means that those giving and receiving cri­
tique need to be able to measure solutions against goals, share insights, 
and ask questions to ensure understanding. You can’t achieve this type 
of dialog by a to-do list sent in an email or over chat. We need to dis­
cuss our designs.
AVOIDING PARTICIPATION
If we want to open up the dialogue during a critique and help ensure 
that we are getting productive participation from others, we should 
make sure that we are critiquing our work alongside them.

When we step around to the other side of the table (figuratively speak­
ing) and start critiquing with the rest of the team, we begin to break 
down the me-versus-you mentality that can often happen during a cri­
tique and make everyone more comfortable with the conversation.
We have seen that actively critiquing our own work with the rest of the 
team can help them feel more comfortable with providing feedback; 
they are less worried about offending because you are critiquing with 
them.
PROBLEM SOLVING
Critique is a form of analysis. When we are participating in a critique, 
we are analyzing our solutions based on what we collectively under­
stand the goals of the product to be. When we switch from analysis to 
problem solving, we are switching from one type of brain function to 
another.
Doing so, especially when a group of people is involved, can cause 
disruption to the discussion. Some individuals are still analyzing the 
original design, some are trying to understand or analyze then new 
ideas being discussed, and others may be trying to formulate their own 
solutions.
By keeping our critiques focused on analyzing the design at hand, we 
facilitate a better, more complete discussion. After wich we can work to 
explore potential solutions to address any weaknesses or opportunities 
raised during the critique.
CONFUSING CRITIQUE WITH REVIEW
Many of us have spent time in design reviews, and they are often con­
sidered the same as critique. Reviews are not critique. Design reviews 
are often scheduled to get some sort of approval to move forward or go 
live. Most of the attendees in a design review (and there are usually far 
too many for productive conversations) are there to ensure that the part 
of the design they own gains approval and moves into the final product, 
and most of the decisions and approvals are tied to deadlines. This type 
of environment is not conducive to productive critiques.
Do not rely on design reviews for critique. You should critique leading 
up to the design review so that there are no surprises and so that your 
design reviews go smoothly.
