GASTROINTESTINAL  
SYSTEM – DIGESTION & 
ABSORPTION 
Learning Objectives 
1. Explain the mechanisms of digestion and 
absorption and identify where they occur in 
the gastrointestinal tract.   
 
2. Explain the absorption of water and identify 
where this occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. 
  
3. Explain the underlying mechanisms for 
diarrhea and its causes.   

CONTROL OF DIGESTION  

PANCREAS EXOCRINE CELL  
Cholecystokinin (CCK) increases secretion of zymogens 
(inactive enzymes) from exocrine cells.  
Secretin increases secretion  
of HCO3- from duct cells 

ABSORPTION OF  
NUTRIENTS & WATER 

ABSORPTION  FAT 

LARGE INTESTINE  
CONCENTRATES WASTE 
~ 2L of non-digested material is delivered to the colon. 
Normally ~ 0.2-0.5L of waste (feces) is excreted per day.  
Diarrhea causes net loss of water & HCO3
- . 
 
Note: absence of  
transporters for  
nutrients. 

WATER ABSORPTION  
IN FASTED STATE 
“Standing water gradient” moves water into the body from the intestine. 

DISORDERS OF THE 
GASTROINTESTINAL  
TRACT  
 
Delayed emptying: 
nausea, vomiting, bloating, heartburn 
 
 
Rapid emptying: 
weakness, dizziness, sweating, & diarrhea 

SECRETORY DIARRHEA  
- caused by an infection (e.g., cholera vibrio).  
- concentration of Na+ and Cl- in the feces equals  
 
290-300 mOsM (isotonic to the body). 
  
OSMOTIC  DIARRHEA  
- caused by presence of osmotically active particles or  
 
poorly absorbed solute (such as Epsom salts)  
 
delivered to the colon.  
- sum of the Na+ and Cl- concentrations in the feces is 
 
 less than 250 mOsM. 
ELECTROLYTES & DIARRHEA  

GENERAL CONCEPTS 
 
1. Gastric emptying into the duodenum occurs slowly   
to allow for neutralization of the acidic chyme.  
2. Hormonal pathways coordinate the secretion of  
bicarbonate, digestive enzymes, and insulin from the  
pancreas and bile from the gall bladder.   
3. Digestion of complex food to small molecules occurs  
within the lumen of the small intestine. 
4. The small intestine is the major site for the absorption  
of nutrients, solutes, and water. 
5. The luminal content of the small and large intestine  
is isotonic at all times!
