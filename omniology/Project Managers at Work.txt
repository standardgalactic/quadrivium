Acknowledgments
Most great projects require a team of people. This book was no exception.
Thank you to each and every interviewee profiled in this book. Your gener-
osity in sharing your time, insights, and career experiences made this book 
possible.
My thanks to several authors and interview experts who have inspired and 
informed my approach. Jessica Livingston (author of Founders at Work (Apress, 
2008) and Josh Steimle (author of Chief Marketing Officers at Work Apress, 
2016) paved the way for me to understanding the opportunity at Apress. Robin 
Speziale, (author of Market Masters: Interviews with Canada’s Top Investors (ECW 
Press, 2016) provided helpful advice and suggestions. I have been inspired and 
informed by Andrew Warner’s interviews on the Mixergy podcast. Timothy 
Ferriss, author of Tools of Titans (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2016), directly 
inspired several of the questions I asked in this book. Reading his book The 4 
Hour Workweek (Harmony, 2009) in 2014 inspired me to create my website, 
ProjectManagementHacks.com.
Thank you to Gary Vaynerchuk and his team for their many inspirational 
­videos. In particular, the YouTube videos “Overnight Success” and “Hard Work 
& Patience” inspired me to overcome the obstacles and surprises I faced in 
this project.
At Apress, I would like to thank the excellent team of editors, designers, and 
professionals who developed this book. Robert Hutchinson worked with me 
in 2016 to design the book. Rita Fernando and Susan McDermott have been 
excellent editors in guiding me through the publishing process.
Thank you to my editors at IDG and ProjectManagement.com. Cameron 
McGaughy, my editor at ProjectManagement.com, has encouraged me to 
cover a wide range of topics in project management. Edward Murray, Amy 
Bennett and Jason Snyder at IDG have worked with me to publish a variety 
of articles on business technology, the Internet of Things, and other exciting 
developments for CIO.com, CSO, and other IDG publications. Thank you for 
your support.
Thank you to my managers and colleagues at the Bank of Montreal. Richard 
Livesley, Kathy Irvin, Yousif Jaurji, and Ali Soheil have been highly supportive 
in my efforts to learn more about project management and grow my career.

Thank you to my parents, Joan and Fred Harpham. As I grew up, I had a 
­constant hunger for books and learning. They were wonderfully supportive 
in my education through books, taking me to the library, international travel, 
and beyond. Your love and support has been highly important over the years.
This book is dedicated to my wife, Dr. Carolyn Harris. Her success as an author, 
historian, and lecturer continue to inspire me. Her constant love, encourage-
ment and support during this project made a tremendous difference.

Introduction
“You’ve been living in Project World for so long you’ve probably forgotten 
that for a long time, projects didn’t matter so much… Think about Apple, 
Google, director James Cameron’s team, Ideo, Pixar, and Electronic Arts. 
These are project-centric organizations. Each one of these organizations 
consists of groups of committed people who ship projects. No projects, no 
organization.”
—Poke the Box by Seth Godin
Project management matters more than ever before. Once the province  
of large companies and governments, project work has spread across the 
economy and our lives. Consider this: in 2013, the Project Management 
Institute estimated more than 15 million project jobs would be created  
by 2020. Even better, the Institute has found that project managers are  
consistently highly paid. According to Project Management Salary Survey 
(ninth edition, published in 2015), the median salary for project managers in 
the United States is over $100,000. That just leaves one problem: How will 
organizations meet the demand for the next generation of project managers?
Some organizations have developed career paths and training programs. 
Other organizations have a less structured approach. You may simply need 
to develop a few project skills so that you can finally achieve some of your 
personal goals. Or you may be seeking to acquire the skills needed to build 
skyscrapers, networks and submarines! Whatever your situation, you may find 
the existing project management literature too technical to suit your needs.
Even though project management is a relatively young profession, there are 
plenty of resources available. You can find project templates. You can find 
standards. These are all helpful. Yet, you may be left wondering how to trans-
late those ideas and methods into your career. You may be considering ques-
tions like this:
• 
How do I get ahead in the field?
• 
How do I get promoted?
• 
How do project managers stay organized and productive?
• 
What books should I read to become more effective?
• 
How do I become a better leader?

Introduction
xiv
These are some of the questions that I explored by interviewing some of 
the world’s most successful project managers. I wanted to know how people 
found their way into the profession. Even further, I was curious to understand 
how projects unfold across a variety of industries and experience levels. In 
presenting this book to you, I hope you will be both inspired by the inter-
viewee’s examples, and find ideas, techniques, and recommendations to grow 
your career.
Throughout the interviews in Project Managers at Work, you will find  
several recurring themes. Project stories, leadership, lifelong learning, career 
development, and productivity are the key themes that you will discover in 
this book. A combination of hard won experience, professional discipline 
and the passion to never stop learning drives these project managers to  
the top.
1. From Stories to Lessons Learned: Reflecting to Improve 
Performance
The “lessons learned” concept is important to project management success. 
By reviewing how the project unfolded, you can find ways to improve your 
performance on future projects. In the interviews, I asked professionals about 
what they have learned from their challenges and triumphs at work. You will 
also find out about how these leaders have put these lessons to work by 
changing their organizations.
To make the most of your lessons learned, integrate those insights in your 
ongoing processes. For example, change a checklist, document template, or 
other process to include your insights.
2. The Many Paths to Leadership: Choose the Right Path for You
The traditional project manager faces a unique leadership challenge. She 
has to deliver the project through the project team. However, many or all 
people on the project team report to other managers. Leading successfully 
in this context requires paying close attention to relationship development,  
networking, and influence. It’s also important to note that there is no single 
road to leadership success. Leadership is more about skills, attitude, and vision 
than personality. If you’re interested in moving to senior levels of responsibil-
ity, demonstrating your leadership ability is absolutely essential.
To develop yourself as a leader, look for opportunities around you. Consider 
pursuing a leadership role through a professional association or a charitable 
organization. You will build your skills and make the world a better place in 
the process.

3. Lifelong Learning: Grow Your Knowledge with Books, Experiences,  
Mentors, and Beyond
Graduation day is no longer the end of the learning journey. Like accoun-
tants and lawyers, project managers are committed to ongoing professional 
development. In fact, some project management certifications, such as the 
Project Management Professional (PMP), have a formal requirement for ongo-
ing professional development. If you have an employer who understands the 
value of learning and development, make the most of that support to learn 
and grow. Remember that learning can come in multiple formats and styles. 
You can learn from books, mentors, reflecting on your experiences (especially 
mistakes), and other areas.
For an excellent introduction to business and rapid skill development,  
I ­recommend the following books by Josh Kaufman: The Personal MBA:  
Master the Art of Business (Portfolio, 2010) and The First 20 Hours: How to Learn 
Anything . . . Fast! (Portfolio, 2013).
4. Career Development: Practical Ways to Get Ahead
In most organizations, you do not start as a project manager as your first job. 
Generally, you first develop your skills in a specific discipline, such as software 
development, engineering, finance, sales, or consulting. If you’re determined to 
transition into project management, pay attention to the strategies used by 
the professionals profiled in this book. Networking, asking your manager for 
opportunities, and developing yourself as a leader are all time-tested strate-
gies to grow your career.
If you are unfamiliar with networking, study this skill and put it into action. 
First, read Never Eat Alone, Expanded and Updated: And Other Secrets to Success, 
One Relationship at a Time by Keith Ferrazzi and Tahl Raz. Second, reconnect 
with current and former coworkers, managers, and classmates. Third, start to 
reach out to new people who are in the careers and jobs that interest you to 
find out about their experiences.
5. Improve Your Productivity
With the right productivity system, you can achieve your priorities and head 
home at a reasonable hour. Your productivity approach needs to include both 
the tactical matters such as managing your calendar and strategic matters 
such as setting meaningful goals. Several of the professionals profiled in this 
book also highlight specific techniques, like time blocking and restricting your-
self to a 40-hour workweek. Experiment with their techniques to improve 
your productivity and get more valuable activities done.

Introduction
xvi
Once you finish reading this book, I would ask you to take two actions:
• 
Choose at least one idea from the book to apply to your 
life and career.
• 
If you find the book valuable, please write a short review 
sharing your thoughts on Amazon.com. It’s one of the 
best ways to spread the message.
Warm regards,

Michael 
Lubrano
Senior Program Manager, Google
Michael Lubrano started at Google in 2011 as a program manager in NetOps. 
He eventually moved to Search Features/Experience, working on user-facing features 
that impact billions of people around the globe. Lubrano graduated from Excelsior 
College with a degree in liberal arts, with philosophy and ethics concentrations. Prior 
to joining Google, he worked with the US government (NASA, the Department of 
Defense, and the Department of State) and in the private sector, including overseas 
postings, primarily in the Middle East.
Lubrano started the program management fireside chats and annual summit at 
Google. He manages projects in search and teaches leadership and related topics 
at Google for program managers.
Bruce Harpham: How did you first get involved in project management?
Michael Lubrano: I started off as a software engineer at a company that 
was a contractor for NASA. About a month into my role, the division man-
ager decided to leave and start his own company. When that news came up, 
the question came up: “Who is going to take over this organization?” While 
my project was going well, I saw the impact of a lack of leadership. Since S&K 
Technologies was a small company, it was easy for me to call up the president. 
I proposed to him that I take over running the office and all the projects.

In my view, I considered myself a mediocre software developer compared to 
my colleagues. I was surrounded by people who were ten times better than 
me at software development. For me to get ahead in my career, I realized that 
I would have to do something different—an activity that I was exceptional at. 
I was excellent at building relationships, moving projects along, and providing 
technical judgment. In contrast, I was only “OK” at writing the code itself. That 
was a transition point for my career development.
Harpham: What were you working on in terms of projects and products at 
this organization?
Lubrano: I was working with NASA’s manned spaceflight program. For 
example, we worked on Project Green Book. This tracked all the data and 
measurements relating to the space shuttle landing process. This included 
everything from tire pressure as the shuttle hits the runway to how many 
heat-absorbing tiles were lost in flight. All this data goes into the Green Book 
system. We created a digital version of the resource so that users could add, 
retrieve, and use data easily every time the shuttle landed.
We also worked on a MER  [mission evaluation room] project. I contributed 
to the system that tracked two different types of issues. First, it tracked anom-
alies and “funnies.” Anomalies would be something like a nut and bolt that just 
flew by one of the astronauts in space. Now we have to track those items. The 
MER system had to figure out where that bolt came from, how it happened, 
and related data. In contrast, a “funny” is something like: “We ran out of paper.” 
A relatively minor problem that needs to be tracked. NASA tracks absolutely 
everything. As a result, there are a huge number of databases at the organiza-
tion to manage all of this data.
Harpham: How did you come to be working with NASA?
Lubrano: Here’s how I got the job at the contractor supporting NASA. 
Previous to that role, I was a programmer at a small privately owned company 
in Springfield, Missouri that manufactured alarm panels.
I always felt that I was a good teacher and communicator. At this time, there 
were ColdFusion discussion forums where programmers discussed technical 
issues, asked questions, and got answers from other people. I often went on 
the forum to answer questions and help people solve programming challenges. 
It turns out the director of the company that ended up hiring me was posting 
questions on this discussion forum! I was consistently the person who was 
answering his questions. Then, one day, he reached out to me via the forum 
with a message: “Hi, I work with NASA. You seem to know technology. We’d 
like to talk to you!” That’s how that job came about.
Harpham: Giving back to the software development community translated 
into a major career opportunity for you.
Lubrano: Yes, it did.

Project Managers at Work

Harpham: From your work with NASA, what’s a project that you’re particu-
larly proud of working on?
Lubrano: I was proud of the work we did after the Space Shuttle Columbia 
explosion in 2003. The Green Book project was important to that investiga-
tion because it meant there was better information to understand how the 
shuttle operated.
There was a major effort to investigate and understand what happened. The 
challenge with government projects is that they’re slow and tend to be com-
plicated. Government requirements also tend to change frequently, so you 
never really have a sense of what you are meant to deliver at the start of the 
project. As a result, it’s difficult to make either the waterfall or agile models 
work. There is constant change that you simply have to deal with all the time.
I remember having to work with our teams and tell them, “We don’t have a 
product manager in this context. Therefore, we have to function in different 
roles.” It’s another example of the classic cartoon about building a swing on a 
tree. There’s one panel called “What the Engineer Delivered,” another on “What 
the Manager Wanted,” and yet another on “What the Customer Wanted.” The 
punchline is that each panel of the cartoon shows a very different result. Getting 
clarity on what we were asked to deliver was a constant struggle.
Harpham: What is a project management principle that you learned the  
hard way?
Lubrano: Thinking back on projects I worked on with NASA and the 
Department of Defense, a principle comes to mind: not making a decision is 
a decision.
There have been times where I did not have a bias to action. I suffered as a 
result. That created problems within the project and it hurt team morale. I’ve 
always said that it’s better to make a bad decision than no decision.
I remember working on a project at the Shaw Group, a construction company 
that builds chemical plants and other facilities. We were not getting approval 
to install Internet connections in China. I could not get a decision from the 
Chinese government or our company, despite escalating the matter to higher 
levels. The project floundered as a result. I kept trying to “do the right thing” 
by getting our company approvals and going back and forth with the Chinese 
government. Instead, I wish I would have made a decision on my own.
Even today, I see technical program managers have a similar problem. They 
often lack a sense of ownership for the problem. They think they need to ask 
permission. I have a personal motto: proceed until apprehended. This is a prin-
ciple that I tell every single person on my team. It’s a principle that I preach to 
everyone in the field. You are here to make decisions or facilitate the process 
to get a decision made. If you are not getting decisions made, you’re not doing 
your job on projects and programs.

When I worked at the Shaw Group, I wasn’t owning the problem. It was 
another epiphany moment. I said to myself, “I’m never going to let this happen 
again.”
Harpham: I think part of the problem is that project management method-
ology puts a strong emphasis on planning, monitoring, and controlling. It may 
encourage the view: “Oh, I should just monitor this problem. Once it turns 
red, I will act on it.”
Lubrano: Yes, that’s exactly right. I have a lot of maxims that I’ve developed 
over time to guide my approach. Proceed until apprehended and taking own-
ership of the problem early is a much better approach.
I also advocate the “T” model for approaching your career development. 
Program managers need two competencies. First, the breadth across the 
domain they’re working in, such as software engineering and construction. By 
breadth, I have to know what a bulldozer is and have a high-level understand-
ing for how software development works. I don’t necessarily need to know 
how to write software code, however. Breadth is the top part of the T.
The vertical part of the T is depth. I often tell my team members about the 
importance of depth in their product area, such as search engineering or 
Google Suggest. You don’t need to know how to write the search engine 
code. That said, you should know how the search and ranking model works. 
You should know the architecture. You should know exactly how the data 
flows through the system—step by step. Program managers generally decide 
to operate at a high level of detail. They miss the depth.
When you don’t have the T model, you run into several problems. You lose 
credibility on the team because they realize that you don’t know what you’re 
talking about. And they don’t leverage you. Second, you cannot proactively 
identify issues if you lack depth.
Harpham: Can the vertical depth be applied to other domains, such as pro-
curement or vendor management?
Lubrano: Let’s take the vendor management case. The horizontal aspect 
of your expertise is that broad area, “vendor management.” However, the 
depth area could be something like handling call center vendors. In that case, 
the person would understand how to transition, implement, and manage call-
center vendors. Generally, program managers sit at the high level of “vendor 
management” and avoid developing depth.
Harpham: When you see it done well, how do people develop this depth? 
Does it come from direct work experience as a technical person? Or some 
other method?
Lubrano: Knowing how to learn and learning quickly is vital. One of the best 
aspects of working for Google is that I work with the smartest people in the world.  

Project Managers at Work

That’s also the greatest challenge in working at Google. By any measure, 
Google staff members are the best learners that I have ever seen. People here 
pick up information, synthesize it, and put it into action quickly.
One of my program managers joined the team and immediately studied Google 
Suggest in depth. Google Suggest is a feature on the Google search engine 
where you type a few letters in and you see a list of suggested searches. Shortly 
after joining the team, she had to learn the entire Google Suggest system in 
order to solve a number of highly complex problems. Beyond learning the 
technology, she also had to meet all the people—the team leads, engineers, 
and others—who work on this product. She had to learn all of this and start 
coming up with solutions within a month. She started out as a relatively junior 
program manager and had to cover all of that.
Harpham: How did you transition from organizations where you’re launching 
satellites into space [and serving institutional customers] to Google, which has 
a different emphasis? How did you teach yourself and get up to speed when 
you joined Google?
Lubrano: Google provides a “ramp” period. There’s a running joke that it 
takes six months to a year before you are able to do anything here. There 
are so many systems to learn! A brand-new person coming into Google will 
just take a while to learn the “Google way.” If you switch to another part of 
Google later, the “ramp up” period is easier to manage.
I started in network operations at Google and had networking experience 
to build on. However, I didn’t understand the Google approach to projects 
and programs. It took me about a year to learn and get my feet wet working 
on smaller projects. Google’s management facilitates this process. There’s an 
understanding that it takes time to get up to speed.
Harpham: Let’s turn to your perspective as a manager. How do you support 
new people to grow and develop?
Lubrano: It depends on the situation. Every human is different, after all. I have 
regular one-on-one meetings with everyone on my team. Some of my past 
managers had this idea that coaching, mentoring, and one-on-ones would be 
done the way the manager wanted it to be done. That view is based on the 
premise that you have limited capacity as a manager. The way you “scale up” 
yourself as a manager when you have a large team is you impose a standard 
process: “This is the way that I coach people, period.”
That same-size-fits-all approach to people may scale, but it is not effective. 
I take an individual approach to coaching based on personality, their role, and 
level of authority. It’s one of the few practices I’ve seen here that doesn’t 
scale. I tend to avoid giving directive orders when somebody comes to me 
with a problem. I typically avoid diving into the details of the problem. Instead, 
I ask them some questions, like: “You’re struggling to get the product manager 

Chapter 1 | Michael Lubrano, Senior Program Manager, Google

to agree to the change. Why?” And then I follow up with: “Well, the proposed 
change pushes out the product manager’s schedule by a month.” I coach 
them individually. In some cases, the person may struggle putting themselves 
in another person’s shoes, so I role-play to help with that point. Another 
person may struggle with saying no.
Harpham: Efficiency is important but it doesn’t apply to everything, espe-
cially when it comes to working with people.
Lubrano: People do not scale well. Processes and technology scale well. 
Imagine if you’re depressed or have psychological difficulties, you may consult 
a counselor for advice. The counselor has training and a process, but they 
customize their approach to that individual.
Harpham: What is your view on relationship development and associated 
skills?
Lubrano: If you’re not an expert at relationship development, you should not 
be a program manager. That’s what we do. We are network brokers. We’re 
master communicators—the glue who connects everyone together. If you 
cannot build relationships and credibility quickly, you’re going to have a prob-
lem and have no business being a program manager.
Harpham: What do you mean by “developing credibility quickly”?
Lubrano: There are two books that radically changed my thinking on 
how to interact with people. First, Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking 
When Stakes Are High by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, 
and Al Switzler [McGraw-Hill Education, 2011]. This book is mandatory 
reading for everybody on my team. This book changes the way you speak 
to people, especially in difficult or controversial settings in the workplace. 
It talks about how we think and how emotions impact our thinking.
The second book is Getting More: How You Can Negotiate to Succeed in Work 
and Life by Stuart Diamond [Crown Business, 2010] on negotiation. By devel-
oping empathy and putting yourself in other people’s shoes, you build trust. 
When other people see that you’re solving their problem rather than creat-
ing new problems, it makes a big impact. Instead of solving tactical problems, 
you start to solve strategic problems. That’s when people start to say, “This 
person is valuable.”
Sadly, many program managers have the reputation of adding complexity in 
many companies. We have this horrible reputation of adding process and 
­slowing down work. Yes, we need process and reports so that other people 
understand what we’re doing. However, people on the project team are more 
likely to do that work if I’ve built trust with them and they trust me. For example, 
an engineer may ask for some additional developers to make a ­product launch.

As a program manager, I can go out and negotiate with another team to get 
that support. When your team sees your contribution, it builds credibility  
and trust.
Harpham: What are some other ways that you build relationships?
Lubrano: At Google, there’s free food for employees. A brilliant consequence 
of that benefit is that many people eat together each day. When you eat with 
people, you get to know them. I know every person on my team: when they 
go on vacation, we’re Facebook friends and so forth. The mentality that a 
manager needs to build walls doesn’t work. The more that you open up, the 
more that people tend to open up to you.
Harpham: How do you connect with people who have a “closed off” style 
or who don’t like to open up?
Lubrano: Crucial Conversations comes into play here. I learned how to 
engage by saying, “I feel like you’re struggling to make this decision. I think that 
you’re upset. Is that true or am I misreading it?” Whether it’s over politeness 
or fear, there’s this impression that we cannot talk about emotions or how 
we’re feeling in the workplace. When you open that can of worms and you 
get it into the open, it changes everything. The other person tends to open up. 
They may say, “Yes, I’m upset. I feel like you’re stepping on my toes.”
You may have to confront some harsh truths in the process. Someone you 
work with on a project may not feel you provide value or that you’re trust-
worthy. If someone is closed off to you, find someone they like and trust to 
get advice and seek to understand the problem.
Harpham: It’s important to know both direct and indirect approaches to 
building relationships are crucial skills to have.
Lubrano: Overall, it’s a question of showing empathy. Take this example: 
I get the feeling that a person is putting up roadblocks everywhere I go. 
Then I ask myself, “How does my project impact him?” It turns out that my 
project measures his team’s performance and he doesn’t like that. He may 
feel that I’m a threat to his status or career. This is the thought pattern that 
you need to think through: What is the other person’s motivation? What are 
that person’s feelings? 
Program managers just don’t do this thinking when it comes to empathy. By 
putting your idea into the open with the other person, many people will open 
to you. That said, there will be a small number of people who will not respond. 
For those people, you may need to take an indirect approach. Ask other 
people in that department for their input and insight on the person you’re 
struggling with. You may not get a direct answer, but eventually you will see a 
pattern in what other people tell you.

Harpham: I understand that you’ve given a presentation on the eight traits 
of a great technical program manager [TPM]. What are those traits?
Lubrano: Here are the eight traits that I’ve identified for great technical 
program managers:
	1.	 They partner with everyone.
Leaders are masters at building relationships, even 
with seemingly difficult people. This is not optional. 
You must be able to do this in order to succeed.
	2.	 They proceed until apprehended.
Program managers take calculated risks. A common 
refrain is to ask for forgiveness rather than permis-
sion. Leaders know when to make decisions with lim-
ited information and when to wait for more details. 
They’re not limited by analysis paralysis. Movement in 
the wrong direction is always better than staying put. 
To use a combat analogy: in a firefight, you don’t stay 
in one place—you keep moving.
	3.	 Program managers are visible.
Technical leads tell me “I have no idea what my pro-
gram manager does.” That’s bad. In every project and 
program, you have to be seen. Leaders have proximity 
to their team. Unfortunately, I see too many project 
professionals locked in their office all day working on 
spreadsheets or other documents instead of engaging 
with people.
	4.	 Leaders conquer their fears.
Leaders act “as if” to achieve their goals. You act as if 
you have confidence. It’s like you’re hacking your mind 
to become effective. Building relationships doesn’t 
come naturally to everyone. However, you can 
develop those skills over time. For example, start by 
asking a few questions in meetings. I sometimes like to 
use a self-effacing question to understand something: 
“I have a dumb TPM question. How does this applica-
tion really work?” In my experience, there’s usually at 
least one other person in the room who would like to 
ask the same question, but they’re too scared to do it.
Impostor syndrome is especially strong at Google. I’m not 
talking about embellishment or overstating your skills.  
You should not have a fear around engaging people, yet 
this fear exists.

	5.	 They never give up.
Think about US Navy SEAL training. Hell Week is part 
of the training program. It’s an extreme test of endur-
ance with minimal sleep. Nobody really understands 
what separates those people who make and those 
who don’t. On some level, it comes down to never 
giving up.
It’s the battle of mind. We accept defeat way too 
soon or don’t give our full strength. Refusing to give 
up means that you keep working. You may have to try 
a different strategy to solve a problem.
	6.	 They have depth.
Recall the T model. The top part of the T is decision-
making, planning, and the skills that program managers 
are known for. The vertical part of the T is the depth. 
Leaders are voracious learners. Consider Elon Musk: 
he built his first company in the technology industry 
and now he’s in the space industry with SpaceX. If you 
talk to him about space, he understands it. He may 
not be a physicist, but he knows the field because he’s 
consumed so much information over time.
It is possible to change industries and succeed. 
However, you have to work twice as hard to learn the 
fundamentals and earn credibility with the team.
	7.	 They understand people.
Understanding motivation is crucial to being a leader. 
I can walk into a room and determine who’s bored, 
who’s angry, and who’s engaged within ten seconds. 
We should be masters at “meta”: the body language 
and related behaviors that go beyond verbal commu-
nication. We have to be amazing observers and put 
that understanding into action.
Consider the different motivations of my daughters 
at one point in time. My older daughter wanted more 
freedom, so we agreed she could stay out an hour 
later if she took care of her responsibilities. My other 
daughter had a different concern. She wanted money 
and we took that into account.

Chapter 1 | Michael Lubrano, Senior Program Manager, Google

	8.	 Program management leaders have vision.
All leaders are dreamers in some way. I remember 
when I started coding in the 1990s. I knew I would 
stay in this industry when I would dream in code. 
Leaders cast a vision in a way that everyone can 
understand. It may come naturally to some people. 
Everyone can learn this. By the usual measures, Elon 
Musk is not charismatic if you listen to him speak. 
But he has a tremendous vision—to put people on 
Mars—and he executes on it, which draws passionate, 
capable people to him.
I’m also inspired by Major Richard Winters. He was the 
leader in Band of Brothers. He has all of those ­qualities. 
When I read Band of Brothers, I was struck by the fact 
he was an amazing leader. I encourage people to read 
Band of Brothers by Stephen E. Ambrose [Simon & 
Schuster, 2001], as well.
Harpham: Any other rules that you swear by?
Lubrano: There’s one other rule I use on my team. I call it the “twenty-
percent rule.” Only twenty percent of our time should be paying “the program 
management tax.” That means meeting notes, schedule management, building 
a report for distribution, and so forth. That should only be twenty percent of 
your workweek. The remaining eighty percent of the time, you will unblock 
people, solve strategic problems, accelerate velocity, and similar activities. Our 
role is not to be report writers, not to create schedules or act as a coordina-
tor. I hate that word “coordination,” because that’s not what we do. We man-
age projects and programs.
Every problem will be solved differently depending on your level. Let’s say 
there are a large number of bug reports coming in. The junior engineer may 
say, “I will act as the triage point, personally.” That’s a tactical solution. In con-
trast, a senior program manager may suggest setting up a rotation with differ-
ent people handling the bug reports on different days. An even more senior 
person will take this approach: “I’m going to pull myself out of the rotation 
and I’m going to build metrics and dashboards so that anybody can use this 
model.” That approach means anyone can take over the model and tools, and 
the solution can scale up. All three approaches solve the problem, but they 
use different methods. By limiting traditional program management activities 
to twenty percent of your time, you have the capacity to address systematic 
problems.

Project Managers at Work
11
Harpham: What are the differences between those approaches to problem 
solving?
Lubrano: The solutions vary in terms of scalability, the impact of the solution, 
and the solution's elegance.
Harpham: Would you recommend delegating out tasks if you see the 
­“program management tax” activities exceeding the twenty percent of your 
time?
Lubrano: Yes, because those problem-solving activities are more valuable. 
When people come to me and ask for a program manager, I ask them why. 
Sometimes I get this response: “Well, we need all the ‘program management 
tax’ activities.” With that response, I will assign a program manager to the 
requesting group for a few weeks as a test.
At that point, I ask a few questions to the technical lead: How many reports 
have you read? How many meeting minutes have you read? The usual answer 
to both points is zero. In that scenario, I realize that they really want an admin-
istrator, not a program manager. It’s a mistake to view program managers as 
senior-level admins—people to take notes, track a schedule, and so forth.
Harpham: What does your productivity toolbox look like in terms of tools 
and practices?
Lubrano: Every program manager has to send out reports or send status 
updates. To be productive, I think about everything as a problem that I need 
to understand. Consider a report that I have to produce on one project: that 
report is probably not going to work on another project. I started with the 
question: “Who is my audience for these reports?” In my case, the audiences 
are executives, technical leads, the project team, and other project stakehold-
ers. All of those groups have different communication needs.
I developed a model that solves all of those needs. The model showed the 
project broken up into major “tracks.” Each track had specific goals [not mile-
stones]. Next to each goal, we had milestones, which were expected to be 
completed that quarter. Last was a status. The only thing TPMs had to fill in 
was the status for the week. And we had a simple red-yellow-green model 
for the track. We developed agreed-on definitions of what red-yellow-green 
meant across the project. It was a very simple report that many different 
groups could follow.
Finally, I wrote a story and included an executive TL;DR [too long; did not 
read—a very brief summary], which was no more than three sentences at the 
top of the document. Every audience was served with one document and each 
audience knew which parts addressed their needs.

Chapter 1 | Michael Lubrano, Senior Program Manager, Google
12
The result? People read the report! When it didn’t come out on time, which 
sometimes happened, people asked me where it was. When has anybody ever 
asked you about a status report? It usually never happens. I look for solutions 
that completely solve a problem. Building something special for each request 
does not scale.
I also use a time boxing strategy to organize my time. I will not exceed my 
time box. If I say that I’m only on a project ten percent of my week, I will not 
go over that. Being religious about time boxing is the only way you can survive.
Focus on a single area is another way to enhance productivity. If you are 
working on five unrelated projects, you will likely be ineffective because you 
cannot develop meaningful depth. I give everyone on my team one domain 
to focus on: one person has core search, one person has Google search on 
Android, and so forth. It’s also important to make the project size appropri-
ate. You don’t give a large number of tiny projects to a program manager. 
For small projects, it is better to assign those projects to people who are 
interested in project work and would like to explore it [e.g., folks who are 
interested in becoming program managers]. That’s a good way to build a 
pipeline of talent for the future.
Harpham: Looking ahead of the next few years, which opportunities and 
trends are you most excited about in your work? Whether that is technology 
or something else.
Lubrano: I think about robots and artificial intelligence. In some circles, there 
is a fear that robots will take over the world. There will be industries that will 
suffer disruption and change through this trend. Program management is likely 
here to stay for the foreseeable future. As long as people are doing challeng-
ing work, there will be a cadre of people at organizing and accelerating that 
work. In the future, there will be greater levels of complexity to manage as 
software and technology continue to take on simple tasks. The automation of 
the human workforce will have far-reaching consequences—and that extends 
to program management.

Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
David Woerner: During my studies at the University of Colorado, I worked 
with NASA as a student. After I graduated, I joined NASA JPL, and I have 
worked through a variety of roles ever since then.
I had good mentors and excellent opportunities at the organization. In the 
late 1980s to early 1990s, flight projects at JPL exploded in number. As a 
result, there was increased demand for project management skills to get those 
projects completed. Overall, it’s been a combination of deliberate strategy on 
my part to find interesting projects and a bit of luck in opportunities coming 
through.
Harpham: What was the NASA project you worked on while at the 
University of Colorado?
Woerner: While I was an undergraduate, the University of Colorado built 
and flew a spacecraft called the Solar Mesophere Explorer [SME] in the 1980s. 
The university hired fifteen undergraduates from the engineering college to 
work on this project, and I was one of them. That project opened the door 
for me because I met people from JPL and NASA.
It was a great opportunity because we were introduced to computer 
systems much more advanced than what was available at the university. I 
was in computer science class with people who had to use an old mainframe 
computer while I had the opportunity to work on a modern “cut and paste” 
computer. At that time, “cut and paste” capabilities were unheard of on 
campus. In fact, one of my classes involved using punch cards! This was a major 
contrast in the technology we had available.
We would call ground stations around the world for the project, such 
as Ascension Island in the Atlantic or one in Australia. We set up the 
communications between NASA, the satellite, and the various ground stations. 
It was a part time project for us, about twenty hours per week. The University 
paid us a decent salary and managed to keep the project and our studies going.
Once we all graduated, JPL hired all but one of the fifteen students. We 
effectively had a two year head start on everyone fresh out of school who 
was applying for work at JPL. It was a very exciting moment for me to join JPL. 
When I came to JPL for the job interview, I had a camera around my neck.  
I was so thrilled to be there, interviewing for a job I would die to have. It turns 
out that I was a natural fit for this organization.
Harpham: How long was that first satellite in operation for?
Woerner: It was in operation long after I graduated from the University of 
Colorado [CU]. It was virtually free for NASA to fly because students and 
professors did most of the work on it. They kept it running for a long time.
The Laboratory of Atmospheric and Space Physics [LASP] was the first 
university lab in the United States to build and fly their own spacecraft.  

Project Managers at Work

SME was a simple spacecraft relative to many of the spacecraft that the US 
was flying at the time. We could measure nitrogen and nitrous oxide in the 
atmosphere with it. We could see the factories running up and down the 
country because of their nitrous emissions. We could actually pin point 
specific factories based on their pollution. It was a novel experience. It was a 
successful project.
Harpham: What was your role in the Mars Pathfinder mission, which landed 
on Mars in 1997?
Woerner: I started working on this project right after my work on the 
Magellan mission, which was launched to study Venus in 1989.
At that time, Dan Goldin became the administrator of NASA. His motto was 
“faster, better, cheaper.” It was a revolution for NASA. We had a reputation 
for building big missions, such as the Apollo missions to the Moon, the space 
shuttle, and so forth. He wanted us to focus on small satellites to see what 
we could do.
JPL set up a concurrent engineering laboratory where they put fifty to one 
hundred junior engineers like me in a room. We were supported by a few 
“gray beards” [highly experienced engineers] to make sure that we didn’t 
screw up too much. We had the mission to create the Mars Pathfinder. My 
assignment was chief engineer on the avionics system for the lander. That 
included designing the electronics for the cruise phase, the entry and descent 
phase, and the ground operations phase. It was an exciting two and a half years!
I had never had that much responsibility in my life. It was a lot of fun, and 
I enjoyed working with some really bright people.
Harpham: How did you get involved in the project?
Woerner: At the time, I had a mentor who I was close with. When the 
opportunity came up, he put my name forward, and I was picked. I was happy 
to accept the assignment. When you have a mentor like Joe Savino, it makes a 
big difference. He was listening to people in various parts of the organization 
to find opportunities for people that he knew. He actually pushed me out of 
the division he led because he felt that I had broader interests that could be 
explored in other divisions. That experience forced me to grow and that was 
for the better. I had greater responsibilities such as leading teams, for risk 
management, and for more.
Harpham: Pathfinder was a step up in responsibility for you. From a project 
perspective, what did you find most challenging?
Woerner: Risk management was a major challenge. I like to compare 
Mars Pathfinder [launched in 1996] and the Mars Science Laboratory [MSL] 
[launched in 2011]. On Mars Pathfinder, NASA gave us $125 million to build 
and fly that spacecraft, which is a ridiculously small amount of money in that 
context. The leadership put a bunch of energetic young people in the room 
to work on this and we went at it. We managed to pull it off.

Chapter 2 | David Woerner, Chief Engineer, NASA

Working on the Mars Pathfinder mission meant working ten to twelve hours 
per day, six days a week. At the same time, it was fun. We had white boards 
on the walls that displayed our progress on hardware, software, and other 
aspects of the mission. It looked like a crazy factory as we worked on the 
mission.
From an engineering perspective, we had to do “seat of the pants” engineering. 
That means operating without two or three engineers to back you up in case 
you made a calculation error or something of that nature. You had to get it 
right all on your own. That alone raised the risk dramatically.
Turning to MSL, it was a nuclear mission. The MSL included a nuclear power 
source, which was a challenge to manage. We had the resources to double 
check our calculations.
Harpham: Were you also working with a fixed launch date in addition to a 
fixed budget?
Woerner: Yes, we had a fixed launch date to meet. I’m working in an 
organization that prides itself on getting everything right when it comes to 
these missions. We do occasionally fail but the culture at JPL emphasizes 
getting everything right. The tools and processes developed to prevent failure 
can get in your way when you’re trying to do something fast and cheap.
This was the conceptual problem with the “faster, better, cheaper” model. 
That concept was in tension with the anti-failure processes and tools that 
had developed at NASA. It caused some friction for us. Management put a 
wall around us so that those historical tools and processes would not get in 
our way.
Harpham: Once you had finished your work and you saw the mission launch 
into space, what surprised you at that point about the rest of the mission?
Woerner: Tony Spear, the project manager for the mission, fired me after 
the launch. [Laughs] I knew when it launched that the mission wasn’t going to 
succeed. I couldn’t believe that we actually pulled the launch off on time. Until 
about a week before the mission hit the Martian atmosphere, I was convinced 
it wasn’t going to work.
I had seen the telemetry come in during the cruise from Earth to Mars. I had 
seen the reports and data on all the subsystems operate correctly. It was 
great to see it actually work as expected for the most part.
When it hit Mars, the lander bounced multiple times against the surface with 
airbags. While it went through this bouncing and landing process, we lost 
communications because the antenna was oriented poorly and our receiver 
could not lock on. At one point, it was out of lock for about a minute—we 
were stunned. Fortunately, it came back. After that point, it worked flawlessly.

Project Managers at Work
19
Harpham: It was a surprise that the mission went as well as it did? 
Woerner: It’s a mental stress test in a way. You’ve just created this mission. 
You know it was done on the cheap. You know it was done on a short schedule. 
Further, you know it was the first time you’ve had this level of responsibility 
on a mission.
Harpham: How does the Pathfinder mission compare to the MSL mission?
Woerner: Mars Pathfinder was completed in about two and a half years. MSL 
was conceived in 2003 and got a green light for a 2009 launch. Ultimately, it 
turned into a seven-year development process because we discovered problems 
when we hit the five-year mark. We discovered two of the subsystems were 
having serious design problems. We had to cancel the launch and postpone 
it two years.
My role in the MSL mission was managing and engineering the nuclear power 
system and the launch vehicle. It was about $400 million for those items—
about $200 million for the nuclear power system and about the same for the 
launch vehicle. For my work, the stakeholders included NASA Headquarters, 
the Kennedy Space Center and their contractors, and the US Department of 
Energy and their contractors. US regulations require the US Department of 
Energy to oversee the manufacture of nuclear power systems. Fortunately, we 
could tell them how we wanted it made for our purposes. I was instrumental 
in the design and integrating the nuclear generator into the spacecraft.
On the launch vehicle side, I had a similar challenge. You have to get the 
nuclear power system through the side wall of the rocket. We required a 
pair of special doors in the rocket fairing: one to insert the nuclear generator 
and bolt it to the spacecraft, the other to charge the cooling system on the 
spacecraft. This whole installation process was done about a week before 
the launch. To get ready to do that operation required more than eighteen 
months of preparation.
The preparation involved many stakeholders. We had reviews with community 
leaders in Florida, and others. Florida’s leaders were important because they 
had to be prepared in the event of a launch accident involving nuclear materials. 
We also had to work with the US Air Force, the FBI, and others concerned 
with national security issues. We had to upgrade the launch complex because 
there had never been a nuclear launch at the site. That meant new security 
systems, increased redundancy for electrical systems, and much more.
For example, the nuclear power system generates 2,000 watts of heat. When 
put inside the MSL spacecraft, the generator would act like a heater in a 
Thermos bottle. If we lost power to the air conditioning system cooling the 
spacecraft, everything would start to heat up. That’s a major problem because 
the spacecraft’s pressure tank and fuel tank are close by—they could overheat, 
burst, and start a fire. The air conditioning system required three separate 
power systems to minimize the risk of power failure.

Harpham: Let’s turn to the stakeholder management issues. Had you worked 
with these stakeholders before, such as the Florida authorities, the US Air 
Force, and others?
Woerner: It was new for me and new for many of them as well. It turns out 
that NASA flies one of these nuclear-powered missions about once a decade. 
Therefore, people come and go through their careers at these organizations. 
You might have some experience with a few of the stakeholders but many of 
the people were new to the process.
Over time, you learn where everybody’s sensitivities are and what their needs 
are. Once you learn those points, you address them to the best of your ability.
Since we were working on a nuclear system, there were hard safety 
requirements to learn to live with. We could not just walk into a building 
that has the nuclear generator. We could not allow people near it. We had to 
adopt a hyper-safety attitude. While I had experience with space flight before 
this time, I had not worked on nuclear matters or with the Department of 
Energy. After seven to eight years working with the Department of Energy, 
I loved them. Once I saw them in operation, I was impressed by how detail 
oriented they were. I still sometimes wonder about other countries with 
nuclear capabilities and whether they are as diligent in handling nuclear 
materials.
Harpham: How did you handle schedule challenges on these projects?
Woerner: The schedule options for launches are forced by the physics of the 
problem. To maximize launch vehicle performance, there are only a few times 
each decade when you would choose to launch to Mars—those occur about 
every twenty-three months. The orbits of Mars and Earth dictate when it is 
best to launch. If you were to launch at a different time, it would take more 
energy. JPL had a mission scheduled for a 2016 launch to Mars but it had to 
be rescheduled due to problems. It’s a problem we face all the time. An actual 
launch period is typically about three to four weeks long for an interplanetary 
mission, so there is not much flexibility when you run into problems close to 
the launch period.
For the MSL mission, everybody was taking orders and trying to get their 
work done. The project was burning through its reserves attempting to solve 
problems. We relied on the engineers to come forward and confess their 
difficulties. We had to assess the value of fixing each specific problem. Everyone 
kept going and we kept trying to put your best foot forward. Eventually, we 
could mathematically prove that we were not going to make the launch date.
NASA had always known we were not playing an easy game. For instance, 
changing requirements made it difficult to get work done. Dollars, schedule, 
and people all get tight as you approach the launch date. The conversation got

21
kind of ugly at that point even though we had put in “pressure relief valves” 
earlier in the process.
When we were setting up our budget, people wrote two sets of requirements. 
One set of requirements was for the case when everything went well. The 
backup requirements were there to give us schedule relief or budget relief 
when the original plan did not work out. Backup requirements might eliminate 
a scientific instrument from the mission or slip the launch as examples. It 
would not be pretty to make a change. Making changes like those has the 
potential to harm the institution’s reputation and its likelihood to do future 
missions. However, sometimes you get forced into those situations.
The engineers couldn’t manage to solve problems on two of the subsystems 
on MSL. This came to a head about eight months before liftoff.
Harpham: I understand that you’ve continued to be involved in nuclear space 
power systems following that mission. What’s your current focus in that area?
Woerner: Right now, I’m the chief engineer for the Nuclear Space Power 
Office at JPL. I’m also the RTG [Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator] 
integration manager for NASA. NASA has a program for radioisotope power 
systems—they serve as my sponsor. One task I have is to enhance the design 
of the type of power system flown on the MSL rover. That generator design 
was started in 2003 and it was ready to go by 2008. As a result, we have a few 
of those generators in storage on Earth. One of them is promised to a 2020 
mission to Mars. The others are unassigned right now. The development cycle 
for these systems is about ten years from start to finish. That means it takes ten 
years to develop a nuclear power system for a five-year mission, you have to 
start the nuclear power system before any specific space mission is approved.
We have been working on ways to improve the design and productivity of 
the nuclear power system, which was first designed with MSL in mind. We’re 
currently transferring those designs to industry for further development. The 
enhanced design will produce about twenty-five percent more power at the 
beginning of its service life. At the end of its service life, power production will 
be fifty percent higher than the current model. It’s a significant power boost 
for long lived missions of ten years or more. These generators are typically 
designed to run for about seventeen years.
In addition, I’m running a study to develop concepts for the next generation 
of generators. These will replace or supplement the current system that 
we’re building enhancements for. These will be long lead projects and require 
extensive coordination across multiple government agencies and laboratories.
Harpham: This long lead time has an impact on requirements. You might 
know what some of the missions will require but other missions haven’t been 
developed. Yet, you have to imagine what is required and act accordingly.

Chapter 2 | David Woerner, Chief Engineer, NASA
22
Woerner: You have to guess what the scientists and others will require 
because they haven’t conceived of the possibilities yet. You take your best 
shot at it based on past experience and what they can tell you today. It’s an 
interesting challenge.
Harpham: How does it work with the industry partners to get the equipment 
built?
Woerner: The enhancements we’re building for the RTG were developed 
at JPL over the last twenty years by a few of our scientists. When the MSL 
landed on Mars, we had high confidence that we could start to transfer this 
technology to industry. We are going to do the upgrade for about $30 million 
compared to the cost of producing a novel generator for about $200 million. 
By starting the development process early, we lower the risk of later problems.
Harpham: How does the interaction between NASA and industry unfold?
Woerner: The generator is a structure made up of subcomponents. My 
purview is to make sure all of the components hang together successfully. 
The technologists and the industrial partners have weekly meetings, and 
I participate in those to provide my input. We also have gate reviews 
because this is a technology transfer—we are aware of the potential to 
delude ourselves on the project. These gates reduce the likelihood that 
we’re fooling ourselves on our progress. On this project, we have three gate 
reviews spread over several years.
Harpham: How do these gate reviews work?
Woerner: Before the gate reviews, we write down criteria that we have 
to pass successfully at the next review. For example, the system has to 
generate X amount of power. The system has to be able to survive the launch 
environment. We get agreement with our customer on the success criteria 
for a gate review. The engineers have to stand up and prove that they have 
met those criteria. We also bring in outside consultants and the Department 
of Energy for advice on designing these gate reviews.
Harpham: You mentioned that self-delusion is a major challenge on these 
projects. How do you approach that challenge?
Woerner: Third parties, such as consultants and the Department of Energy, 
are helpful in addressing self-delusion. We go looking for people who are 
good at seeing our blind spots and exposing them to us. On the other hand, 
it’s a small community and we know most of the players already.
Recall the earlier example of the slipped schedule with the MSL launch? 
Everyone was working hard and trying to look good for NASA. At some 
point, we realized we were in trouble and realized we had to add two years 
to the mission before launch. Tests and gate reviews can reduce the chance 
of getting hit by delusions.

Harpham: If you compare the project management processes you’re using 
today versus the 1990s, where do you see the greatest improvement?
Woerner: Risk comes to mind first. When we did Mars Pathfinder, risk 
was not really an area of focus. We did have one person on Pathfinder who 
worked on risk, and we did have a short list of risks that were transformed 
into requests for funds.
In contrast, we had a meticulous approach to risk on MSL. Every subsystem and 
every engineer had baskets of risk. They understood where all the problems 
could arise. Further, they understood the probability of a risk occurring and 
the cost if they did arise. At the project level, that information would be put 
together, and we could see how project risk evolved over time.
In this business, risk is hugely important. It’s not practiced uniformly across 
NASA though. JPL has its own rules on how to approach risk. The risk 
approach used on MSL was transformative for me: how to manage money 
and the burndown of money to address risk. We were given some reserves, 
but how would we know if we had enough reserves? Risk analysis helped on 
that point.
Harpham: How do you segment risks and treat them differently? In the 
financial industry, some risks are well understood and can be managed with 
insurance or other methods. In contrast, other risk types are harder to 
forecast and mitigate. How do you approach these risks?
Woerner: Almost all risks are not the sole property of the person who 
thought them up. They start out that way, but then they get expert review 
and the relevant parties are identified. The question becomes: can you budget 
some amount of money to mitigate a risk and if it becomes a problem and 
what is the likelihood of that happening? The less you know about the risk and 
its probability, I think you have to budget more money against it.
Risks are then graded into categories. At JPL, we use five categories for risk 
that consider the likelihood and consequences of the risk event occurring. 
A project might say, “Category 5 risks would consume one-fourth of the 
project budget.” So if I had found something that risky on the project, I would 
probably change the spacecraft or mission design significantly to mitigate the 
risk. In contrast, a risk category 1 event might cost a work month of effort 
to address.
MSL cost over $2 billion, so a twenty-five percent budget impact is very 
significant. That scale made it painful for managers to ignore risk.
Harpham: What is your approach to mentoring others in the organization?
Woerner: My experience has changed from when I first started at JPL. I now 
view a new hire as someone who has no experience. In contrast, someone 
who might be acceptable for a technical job might have seven to eight years 

Chapter 2 | David Woerner, Chief Engineer, NASA
24
of experience. A good person for a challenging job will often have over ten 
years of experience.
The brand-new person—two years or less of experience—is somebody you 
give mathematical and technical problems to and review their work with 
them. You encourage them to keep a notebook, learn the JPL basics relating 
to performance expectations, and doing engineering. There are also some 
classes for new hires to help them get up to speed. That’s my approach to 
mentoring someone at that level.
If we’re talking about someone with seven to ten years of work experience 
at JPL, that’s the kind of person I love to get onto a complex project like a 
nuclear power system. I start throwing graduate level work at them—they get 
juicy problems to chew on, challenges that will keep them up at night. With 
the right kinds of problems, they will work long hours and have a good time 
doing the work.
I’ve seen two kinds of problems people can work on. There are problems that 
suck—these cause people to walk away from their job and look elsewhere for 
a new opportunity. On the other hand, there are juicy problems, and people 
will love you for assigning those.
Last year, I worked with an exceptionally bright person who had graduated 
from Cal State Fullerton. He was just head and shoulders above everyone else 
around him. He knew how to put together and deliver presentations about 
his engineering work, and he did great engineering.
Other people are harder to bring out of their shell. In that way, you have to 
use unique approaches. I have one person working for me who is quiet and 
doesn’t ask many questions. In this case, I am taking a proactive approach 
to engage him. I gave him a journal article and asked him to discuss it with 
me within a week. That process encouraged him to open up, dive into the 
technical approach in the article, tell me what he learned, and then I could find 
out what he should learn next.
Harpham: What defines a juicy problem where you’re happy to be up late 
working on it?
Woerner: A juicy problem looks like this: “Don’t tell me what this electrical 
circuit does. Tell me how it will fail, and why it fails. Even better, tell me the 
math and physics behind how this component will fail. What are the other 
functions that could be done with this component that nobody else has come 
up with yet?” That’s an example of a juicy problem. Send them on a voyage of 
discovery. Find the wonderment in a challenge.

Project Managers at Work

The idea is to encourage people to think broadly about a problem. If I gave 
somebody an equation to solve, they could probably do it in a flash. However, 
that doesn’t advance our understanding. Instead, I want to know where the 
inflection points are in the equation, what happens if I invert two of the 
parameters, or what does this equation mean for the hardware we’re using?
In a way, solving a particular problem is only part of the goal. The real goal 
is to change how a person thinks about the world around them. If you hire 
an engineer, and you only have them build flight computers, that person 
will be good at those computers. Instead, I would have them build a flight 
computer in the context of all the scientific instruments on a mission and the 
environmental forces on the computer, and identify design changes to make 
the computer more resilient against failure, and other factors. Explore and 
envision a rich multi-dimensional world, not a one-dimensional world.
Harpham: For the reader who is interested in changing their career path 
from engineering into project management, how would you suggest they 
pursue that move?
Woerner: Let’s start with the assumption that you have opportunities to do 
projects. That may not always be the case, however.
A person’s home organization has to promote them relentlessly. A new person 
coming into projects tends to start at a disadvantage compared to more 
experienced project managers. If you want to get into project management, 
you’ve got to have the skills or the capability to be successful. Nobody wants to 
give a multi-million-dollar mission to an engineer without project experience. 
You’ve got to build up to that level slowly. That’s the JPL approach: give people 
smaller projects to grow on.
To reach the project management level, you need more than skills with 
schedules, finances, risk management, and all those management bins labeled 
with buzzwords. People skills are essential for success. A person needs to 
have managed four or five people in a semi-stressful context. Projects are 
stressful, so a person needs to be ready for that. From there, career growth 
will be about adding responsibilities to your job. The more complex the job, 
the more a person will be seen as a leader.
Harpham: If a person has managed a team but has not struggled with stressful 
conditions, then perhaps they are not ready to lead a project.
Woerner: I agree with that.
Harpham: In terms of managing your daily work, what productivity methods 
and strategies do you use?
Woerner: There are parts of project management that I find boring—day to 
day financial management is boring to me—though planning the budget for the 
year is interesting. Some boring work goes along with any job. The question 

Chapter 2 | David Woerner, Chief Engineer, NASA
26
I face is—what are the interesting problems and questions I can develop to 
explore?
I keep myself excited by focusing on strategic activities that have broad impact. 
I look for difficult questions to work on from an engineering or scientific 
perspective. I also keep my fingers on technical work to a degree. That 
prompts me to come up with good questions and assignments for my teams 
to work on.
Harpham: Thoughtful delegation is a key part of the strategy. For example, 
problem A would be great for Jane but not problem C.
Woerner: Exactly right.
Harpham: Which books and other resources have been valuable in your 
outlook and changing how you think about your work?
Woerner: I earned an MBA degree about five years after starting at JPL.  
A few aspects of those studies were very helpful. I studied with Warren 
Bennis, a noted author on leadership. I read his books chronologically, 
so I could see how his thinking on leadership evolved over time. When 
he first started writing, the books looked at what was a leader and how 
they did their job. Eventually, his later books, such as On Becoming a Leader  
[Basic Books, 2009] gave me insight into working with people.
I find it helpful to attend conferences and lead those events to learn about the 
latest research. I’ve organized an IEEE Aerospace Conference, where I invited 
leading researchers from around their world to make presentations—similar 
to a TED talk, but focused on a technical audience with interests in science, 
aerospace, and engineering topics.
I found Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman [Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 
2011] to be helpful in thinking about consciousness and our thinking processes. 
On the same topic, I’ve read NeuroLogic: The Brain’s Hidden Rationale Behind 
Our Irrational Behavior by Eliezer Sternberg [Vintage, reprint edition, 2016]. 
I’m interested in brain science and what that tells us about behavior. I’m also 
interested in the field of behavioral economics—Dan Ariely has some great 
books in that field. I look for people who are on the cutting edge doing solid 
work that will teach us new insights.
Harpham: Over the next three to five years, what are some of the science 
and technology opportunities that interest you?
Woerner: I’ve worked on seven or eight deep-space missions that have been 
highly successful. I have also worked on three technology projects, one of 
which was a major failure. Making my current technology into a success is 
my focus—we’ll know one way or another in a few years. I’d like to see 
this technology put into production and fly on a spacecraft. There are other 
pressures in my organization. However, I would like to get this project shipped 
out the door.

Chapter Summary
• 
Recommended books include On Becoming a Leader by 
Warren Bennis, Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman, 
Neurologic by Eliezer Sternberg, and Dan Ariely’s books.
• 
Grow your career with mentors. Navigating a large 
organization and identifying good career opportunities is 
easier with a mentor. Seek a mentor who can support 
your growth.
•

identify risks when you are deeply involved in a project’s 
work. To address this situation, consider NASA’s 
approach of bringing in outside experts to provide risk 
advice.
• 
Create multiple sets of requirements: With a backup set 
of requirements, you can respond more quickly to major 
changes such as missing a launch window.
• 
Use gate reviews. Define certain performance or success 
criteria that the project has to meet at predefined stages 
before the project can advance further.
• 
Develop people by giving them challenging problems.

Agile Coach, Salesforce
Tamsen Mitchell is an agile coach at Salesforce, with over 17 years of experience 
in the software industry. She facilitated agile transformations in three companies 
and coached multiple teams on agile software development. Mitchell’s background 
in architecture laid a foundation in traditional project management. After deciding 
that designing buildings that actually obeyed the laws of gravity was not for her, she 
thought that virtual buildings would be much more fun. This led to a producer role 
in the video games industry, first at The 3DO Company, and then at Shaba Games 
(later Activision Blizzard).
Mitchell has always been around strong and creative storytelling environments, 
where thinking outside the box was nurtured. Her next industry jump landed 
her as a project manager at Pixar Animation Studios, working with the research 
and development team and the stereographic (3D) department. Mitchell later 
moved to LinkedIn to become a technical program manager. This was where 
her interest in coaching grew. She currently specializes in crafting learning and 
development programs that maximize the retention and engagement of the 
participants at Salesforce.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in the world of project 
management?
Tamsen Mitchell: I have had a winding career path. I studied architecture at the 
Mackintosh School of Architecture, University of Glasgow. I originally thought I 
would move into the architecture profession. I found that I enjoyed the creative 
and theoretical challenges of architecture work. During my ­studies, I had a one 
year placement at a firm to learn more about how ­architecture is ­practiced.

I decided to come to San Francisco for that experience. It was an opportunity 
to combine travel and professional experience.
In San Francisco, I was essentially working as an architecture intern at several 
architectural studios. The harsh reality of work as a professional architect 
was quite a shock to me! After that experience, I decided that I wanted to 
move into a different field. While in San Francisco, I met fellow British expats 
who happened to be involved in the video game industry—many of them 
were engineers and other technical professionals. Learning about the video 
game industry was exciting. It occurred to me that I could use my architec-
tural knowledge in games—to design buildings and other structures—without 
­having to worry about building codes. That idea would later lead to work in a 
variety of roles in the video game industry.
Following graduation, the contacts I had made in San Francisco helped me find 
my first job in the video game industry. I found that the planning and project 
management skills I developed through my architecture studies came in very 
helpful. Within a year of working in the video game industry, I moved into my 
first project management role. That first role involved project management 
at the portfolio level—managing release dates and activities across multiple 
projects.
Harpham: What was one of the most complex video game projects you 
worked on?
Mitchell: I got started in that industry in the 1990s when it was dominated 
by console systems like PlayStation and Nintendo.
From a project perspective, this meant multi-year projects to produce a game 
and then shipping the game on a CD or cartridge. In contrast, today’s games 
are delivered as a download or as a “software as a service” model. In those 
earlier projects, there was no easy way to publish a patch or update to the 
product.
There are two sides of the video game industry. There’s the publisher side—
and the developer side. The publisher has a focus on sales, marketing, and dis-
tribution. The developer side has a focus on creating the code and content of 
the game itself. I was working as a producer on these games on the publisher 
side at The 3DO Company. At one point, I was managing about fifteen or so 
different product lines, such as High Heat Baseball, the Army Men series, and 
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix, from a portfolio management perspective.
Harpham: What other project roles did you encounter in the video game 
industry?
Mitchell: A few years later, I moved into a different type of project manage-
ment in the video game industry. I moved to the developer side of the industry. 
I was hired as the company’s sole project manager at Shaba Games, a small 
developer, which was later purchased by Activision Blizzard, a large publisher.

When I started at that developer, there were around forty people working 
there. In addition to engineers, there were artists, animators, designers, and 
other professions. Eventually, the company grew up to 150 people at its peak 
in the late 2000s.
I managed the development of Tony Hawk’s Thug 2 Remix for the launch of 
the Sony PlayStation Portable. This was a “port” project—i.e., the game had 
already been made by a different company, and we were converting it to run 
on a different piece of hardware. The team was small—maybe twenty people. 
It launched in 2005. It was a technically challenging project: the game was to 
run on an unknown piece of hardware with limited information of the techni-
cal specs and a brand-new format [i.e. the UMD mini disks]. We could never 
run the code to test it on actual hardware from the actual media until after it 
was released. On top of that, the original game had to be highly optimized to 
run on the reduced hardware spec.
During this time, I also got involved in video game projects with new types of 
challenges. For example, I worked on a Spider-Man video game. It’s a major 
intellectual property and you have to work effectively with Marvel [owner of 
Spider-Man] on it. There are also actors involved and intellectual property law 
considerations to think through.
Harpham: On these projects working with Marvel and other franchises, 
what did your role look like?
Mitchell: I was managing the engineers and artists to execute the ­project.  
I would also work with other people at Activision, our parent company, as they 
focused on marketing, and working with third parties and related ­activities. 
It was my role to move the project forward and ensure that constraints  
[e.g., Marvel’s restrictions on their intellectual property] are followed.
Harpham: I’d like to make sure that I’m clear on structure of the industry.  
Can you define the difference between a developer organization and a publisher?
Mitchell: The developer organization makes the game. They write the code, 
create the art, the story, the game play, and so forth. The publisher, in this 
case, is similar to a book publisher in some ways. The publisher will manage 
copyright considerations and other similar activities outside the project. For 
example, the developer may say, “We’d love to use a certain song in our game.” 
The publisher would then manage the request and explore whether or not it 
was feasible to purchase rights to use that music in the game, given our budget 
and the license considerations.

Chapter 3 | Tamsen Mitchell, Agile Coach, Salesforce
32
Harpham: Would the developer and publisher be different divisions of the 
same company or totally distinct entities?
Mitchell: It depends—they may be units of the same company or separate. 
The people who are passionate about making games generally go to work at a 
developer. In contrast, the publisher side is more about the business of making 
and selling games.
Harpham: You have worked in several different industries: architecture, 
video games, and software services. How did you approach changing indus-
tries in your career?
Mitchell: Aside from my studies, I wasn’t in architecture that long, so it was 
relatively easy to make a switch. In the mid 2000s, I started to get interested in 
the agile methodology for managing projects. The principles and the mindset 
is the same when it comes to using agile in different industries. I treated my 
changes to different industries with this view: I understand planning, prioriti-
zation, and related skills. Then I would ask, “How do these skills apply in this 
other industry?”
Once I moved to a new industry, I started to ask a few questions. For example, 
what is the technology stack [e.g., is it LAMP—Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP] 
in use here? Who is the customer and what do they want? I had to become 
very good at learning the different technologies and customer needs in each 
place. From the 2000s onward, I had one stable skill set—agile and project 
management—that I could use in each new role. Around that stable core, I 
would then learn new technologies and related industry knowledge to suc-
ceed in each industry.
After working in the movie industry, I joined LinkedIn. There were interesting 
challenges in that move because of the scale of users and technology involved 
in running LinkedIn. It was also a new experience to work on a web-based 
product, which is quite different from games distributed on CDs or consoles.
Harpham: What other questions did you consider when you moved to a 
new industry?
Mitchell: It was helpful to consider the organization’s history and understand 
what mistakes and problems they suffered in the past. That history tends to 
inform risk management—certain risks tend to be better understood due to 
an organization’s history.
I also found that the teams and units I joined often did not have a formal 
project management process or role in place. At this point, I’ve also learned 
whether or not a given company is going to be a good fit for me: Are they 
interested in improving and using better project management practices?

Harpham: What have you learned about company culture through your 
experiences?
Mitchell: When it comes to technology companies, I’ve noticed certain pat-
terns. Some companies are technology led, design led, or product led. For 
example, Google is known for strongly emphasizing technology: engineers and 
technologists have significant influence and authority. In contrast, design and 
designers have a much greater role at Apple. You can also have customers that 
are focused on the product or a problem.
LinkedIn was heavily technology focused, with a major emphasis on the product. 
This culture is probably influenced by the fact that many senior LinkedIn tech-
nology people came from Google. I’ve found that some companies that have a 
technology or engineering focus don’t always appreciate the value of project man-
agement. To illustrate with an extreme example, an engineer at such a company 
might say, “I’m an engineer. I call the shots here.” That attitude may diminish the 
role and contribution of the project or program manager.
Harpham: What was your response to this environment where the value of 
project management is not recognized?
Mitchell: In short, you have to prove the value of project management. 
I believe that seventy percent of this job is relationship building and treating  
people like people [rather than treating them like robots]. When you’re  
working with software engineers all day, relationship and people skills may 
not be at the top of their list. You start by showing the engineers that your 
contribution makes their life easier and more effective.
At LinkedIn, my approach was to build strategic relationships with the engi-
neering leadership and the product leadership. My goal was to understand 
their concerns: What do they want to fix? I take a baby steps approach: let’s 
fix the problem you’re facing right now. For example, you have trouble with 
release planning. Let’s figure it out and improve that process. By improving 
release planning, it helped that group to become more reliable and predictable 
in their work.
Harpham: What was valuable about helping the department to become 
more predictable?
Mitchell: By predictable, I mean that they could make an estimate for work 
and then achieve that estimate. If the group said a given project would take a 
month to complete, we would generally complete it in a month. That predict-
ability increased the group’s standing in the eyes of senior management. The 
strong relationship that I developed with this group made it possible to give 
them support and direction to improve.

In other cases, I’ve seen project managers treated almost like “bean counters.” 
For example, engineers might say, “Oh that project manager is constantly 
referring to their Gantt chart. They’re annoying me by asking for progress 
updates.” It’s better to start the relationship with a focus on the person’s 
needs [e.g., to improve estimation accuracy and delivery] rather than starting 
the conversation with technical project management questions and comments.
Harpham: If you were starting a new relationship with someone important 
in your work, how exactly would you develop that relationship?
Mitchell: It may sound a little corny at first. Start with this simple principle: 
being able to listen closely to a person when they answer questions. I like to 
ask questions, like “What has gone wrong in the past?” or “What have you 
tried before to solve this problem?” In a way, this approach is almost Coaching 
101. Asking non-judgmental, open-ended questions makes a big difference. In 
terms of attitude, it’s important to show true curiosity to that person’s posi-
tion and problems.
When I started at Pixar and LinkedIn, here was my approach: I would say, “Hey, 
let’s grab lunch and chat.” I wanted to understand what was happening in the 
business. My first step would focus on the team or the organization’s leaders 
and managers. I would seek to find out what they care about, what they value, 
and what their goals and vision are for the group or teams. I want to find out 
where I can help. More specifically, I wanted to understand the stakeholder’s 
situation. What do they see as problems or challenges? I’m seeking to develop 
a “relationship map” of the department to see how people relate to each 
other and understand the history of those relationships.
Harpham: Were the people you met generally open to your relationship 
development approach?
Mitchell: It depends on the person I’m reaching out to. Some people are 
interested in engaging with you, and some are not. You have to take their 
predisposition into account as you work at getting to know people. If you 
approach someone and they don’t want to engage, I back off and direct my 
efforts to other people who are open to connecting. I find that when people 
have pain points in their work, there is often a willingness to discuss those 
points, so that can be a good opening.
In fact, I find that few people are asked about the problems and pains they’re 
experiencing. It tends to go unnoticed and that leads to a resentment building 
up.
Harpham: How does coaching fit into the picture?
Mitchell: When I was working at LinkedIn, I was responsible for the delivery 
of various products, including the identity team, which oversees your LinkedIn 
profile. In that work, I coached people on ways to work better together and 
make their lives easier. Over time, I became interested in coaching people,

compared to the traditional nuts and bolts of project management. I realized 
that coaching was interesting to me, and so I decided to make that my focus.
I wanted to embody the servant leadership model. I view my role as “I’m here 
to help you” rather than “I’m judging whether we messed up as a team.”
Consider this analogy: agile coaches are like vampires in that you have to be 
invited in. Unless you’re invited in, you’re not going to have much of an impact. 
Your advice is not going to be wanted. If you are invited in, there’s a desire for 
help, because the team is in trouble or perhaps they’re curious about learning 
how to do better.
This analogy also helps me to prioritize my time. If I’m not getting a good 
reception in one area, I can step back and look at other places where I can 
make a contribution. You have to remember that you can’t fix everything!
Harpham: Can you share an example of a department “hitting rock bottom” 
and inviting you in to assist them?
Mitchell: The technology organization at Salesforce is massive and there are 
less than twenty agile coaches here. Therefore, we had to choose carefully 
where it makes sense to use our time.
In some cases, the department may reach out to me directly to ask for sup-
port. In other cases, the relationships I’ve built with leaders and other peo-
ple in the organization bring situations to light. I might hear something like 
“There’s pain in this team. They’re in trouble. Could you help them?”
I sometimes also see problems come up on our internal bulletin board. If 
people post messages like “How on Earth do we do X?” or “We can’t do 
Y!”—those are triggers that I may be able to help that group as an agile coach.
Harpham: Let’s say that you’re brought in to help a new department tomor-
row. How do you start your agile coaching process with them?
Mitchell: I start by defining coaching. I define coaching as a balance of 
teaching, facilitating, mentoring, and actual coaching based on agile and 
lean principles. Next, we create a coaching agreement to define our work 
together. That agreement will cover questions like “What do you expect 
from me?” and “What do I expect from you?” It’s like setting up a set 
of working agreements. That agreement also covers feedback and the 
form that feedback takes. The agreement also covers “How do we know 
if we’re succeeding in our work together?” The group and I both define 
the agreement.
Harpham: Is there an educational or training component to the engagement, 
where you’re teaching agile methods and techniques?
Mitchell: Yes, in some cases. Overall, the agreement is about coming up with 
the rules of agreement for the coaching process.

Chapter 3 | Tamsen Mitchell, Agile Coach, Salesforce
36
Harpham: What happens next in an agile coaching engagement?
Mitchell: I like to start with an agile retrospective. That exercise helps people 
to open up about their pain points: what’s going wrong and what the “bright 
spots” [activities and processes that are functioning well] are in their work. Partly, 
I’m looking for extremes: What are the greatest pains the group is suffering? 
Likewise, what are the group’s greatest strengths that can be built upon?
There’s an element of mentorship in this work. In some cases, I draw on spe-
cific examples of successful practices that I’ve used in my own experience. 
However, I generally limit how many suggestions I provide because I want the 
group to engage in the process and develop their own solutions.
The coaching agreement usually has principles like “I promise to give you honest 
feedback in a constructive manner.” If that is stated up front and agreed to, that 
principle sets the tone for the work. With that in place, I may identify certain 
dysfunctional habits. For example, I may observe a discussion in a retrospective 
and point out, “Is that type of comment in line with providing honest feedback in 
a constructive manner?” That’s when you can have a breakthrough in the group 
recognizing their habits.
Harpham: What kinds of systematic dysfunctional patterns have you seen 
occur repeatedly in your work?
Mitchell: Teams or individuals will rush to fix a problem before they have 
properly analyzed the problem. Put another way: they’re jumping to solutions 
as opposed to figuring out the problem. That’s a key dysfunction that I often 
see.
I also see people not honoring commitments in their work. I also see people 
not understanding the meaning of an estimation versus a guarantee. I also see 
misalignments between a product person and the team members doing the 
work. There’s also a whole category of interpersonal problems: single points 
of failure, back stabbing, and hero worship, for example.
In terms of solutions, I see many groups attempt to solve a human dynamics 
problem by using a process solution. People don’t like talking about soft skills 
and human dynamics problems at work, even though that may be the most 
effective path to a solution. As an agile coach, I sometimes serve as a mirror 
and show them: “This is what is going on in your department. Do you recog-
nize this?”
Harpham: Can you walk me through an example where you helped a group 
solve dysfunctional practices?
Mitchell: Recently, I had an informal coaching conversation with someone 
I met earlier during a Scrum Master Foundation workshop I delivered. He 
mentioned that he had been given the assignment of “making his team more 
predictable and better at estimating.” At first glance, that’s a fairly common 

Project Managers at Work
37
assignment. I started to explore the issue by asking questions like “What has 
the team tried?” “What’s going wrong?” and “What actions might you have 
done differently?”
It turns out that the team never broke down work into smaller pieces. 
Therefore, there was a lot of guessing in terms of coming up with estimates 
for how long work would take to finish. As a result, it’s no surprise that these 
poorly developed estimates tended to have accuracy problems.
I explained a few ideas to get the person moving in the right direction. 
However, I made it clear that I would not be providing a comprehensive solu-
tion: he had to engage in the process as well. I also asked him to complete a 
few steps on his own and then come back to me to discuss it in a few days.
Harpham: You’re pointing out the critical value in taking the time to properly 
identify and define the problem before moving on to a solution. What is your 
overall approach to problems and the problem-solving process?
Mitchell: I generally start with the premise that the “obvious” solution to the 
problem may not be correct. I may have some instinct for the problem and the 
solution, but I keep that in check for a period of time. I allow myself the time 
and space to look around and explore other aspects of the environment. For 
example, is there a cultural problem? What about conflict within the organi-
zational hierarchy?
I recently heard from a department where they claimed to have commu-
nication problems. Their solution? Hold more meetings. It turned out that 
the team was spread out over a variety of time zones around the world. 
Therefore, any given meeting time would frustrate at least one team member 
who had to come in early or stay late to attend the call. The group never 
directly spoke about how this difficulty affected them. In this case, it was an 
organizational problem instead of a being a communication problem.
Harpham: You encourage people to slow down in their problem-solving 
process. Let’s put solution A to the side for the next hour and explore the 
problem more deeply.
Mitchell: At a basic level, there are objective ways to identify and fix a prob-
lem. There are also subjective ways to approach the problem.
Harpham: What’s the difference between an objective and subjective 
approach?
Mitchell: Process-driven approaches would be an example of the objective 
approach. That is the approach often favored by engineers. The objective approach 
may be encouraged by a manager who phrases their need for improvement 
by saying, “This department needs to increase its agile velocity,”—i.e., focus on 
improving a metric.

Chapter 3 | Tamsen Mitchell, Agile Coach, Salesforce
38
The subjective approach may define the problem by saying, “We need to focus 
on how we resolve problems on our team.” Or, “What are our shared values 
for working together?” I often find that engineers and most businesses are 
less interested in that kind of conversation. However, those “touchy feely” 
conversations are often the best way to solve a problem.
Harpham: Based on your observation of seeing other agile coaches in action, 
what mistakes do you see novices make?
Mitchell: It’s easy to feel like you have to fix everything. It’s not your job as an 
agile coach to create the solution and implement it for someone else. That’s 
not teaching them to fish. You’re not there to provide the answers. You’re 
there to facilitate the learning process.
There’s also a tension to manage in this role. On the one hand, you’re gener-
ally recognized as the agile expert in the room. On the other hand, you don’t 
want to lapse into arrogance and order people around. As a coach, it’s impor-
tant to have the mindset that there’s always more to learn and discover. That 
perspective keeps you improving personally and keeps you from falling into 
the arrogance trap.
Harpham: Speaking of learning, what are some of the books and resources 
that have been most valuable to you professionally?
Mitchell: I took a great course called Training From the BACK of the Room! 
by Sharon L. Bowman. It covers how to construct and present information as 
a trainer or teacher. The approach is based on cognitive science ideas related 
to how people learn and use information. Fundamentally, it teaches how to 
create and deliver content so that people will remember it.
Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders, by L. David 
Marquet [Portfolio, 2013] is a great book. It’s a great exploration on leadership 
and how to empower your team. I’ve read that book a few times. One of the 
insights I’ve taken from the book: start by establishing trust. The problem is 
not with the people.
I’ve also taken several excellent courses with the Agile Coaching Institute. 
Lyssa Adkins, author of Coaching Agile Teams [Addison-Wesley Professional, 
2010], is one of the people behind the course. I found their Integral Agile 
Wizardry course quite helpful. A number of my questions and techniques 
have come directly from my studies with the Institute. They opened my eyes 
on how to properly coach.
I also quite liked Scaling Up Excellence: Getting to More Without Settling for Less 
by Hayagreeva Rao and Robert I. Sutton [Crown Business, 2014]. They’re 
experts from Stanford. I learned from their insight that “the bad” is stronger 
than “the good” in many organizations. Therefore, bad problems have signifi-
cant impact and need to be nipped in the bud.

Harpham: What habits and systems go into your personal productivity 
strategy?
Mitchell: Multi-tasking hurts my productivity, so I make a point to avoid that 
behavior. I like to have time to think deeply and process what’s happening. 
I sometimes wonder if I have that process correct: how I know if I’ve done 
enough reflecting and that it’s time to move to execution.
When I become particularly overwhelmed with distractions, I like to use the 
Pomodoro Technique [i.e., set a timer for twenty-five minutes to work with-
out interruption on a task, and then take a short break and continue the 
process]. When I use the technique, I tell people that I am using it and not to 
interrupt me during that time. It’s a great technique to help me focus. In fact, 
we’ve made it into a bit of a game at the office. Some of my co-workers have 
bought me some silly hats to wear. It’s a good way to signal “do not talk to me 
while I have the hat on.” This approach helps me to get into a flow state where 
I’m exceptionally productive.
My productivity approach also covers how I manage technology. I have two 
smartphones: one is my work phone and one is my personal phone. When 
I get home at night, I plug in my work phone for charging and turn it off. 
I do not touch that phone until I leave for work the next day. If I didn’t do 
that, I would constantly be checking my email.
From a self-management standpoint, I’m ruthless with how much work in 
progress I have at any given time. I hate not being involved in an activity, espe-
cially if it might impact me. However, I’ve gradually realized that I have to set 
limits on my work and let other people do their work. I tell myself, “There 
are other people who are perfectly capable of doing this work. I don’t have 
to be involved in each and every project.” This practice helps me to keep my 
perfectionist streak under control.
Harpham: Do you find project management practices helpful in other areas 
of life?
Mitchell: I just planned my wedding using the Trello application! It worked 
out well. It was helpful to have everything documented so that we could both 
work on the project and balance the load. After all, a wedding is a project that 
involves a lot of people.

Isabelle Tremblay began working at the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) in 1998 
as a research and development engineer in robotics. She received a bachelor’s degree 
in mechanical engineering and a master’s degree in aerospace engineering from the 
École Polytechnique de Montréal. She is also a graduate of the International Space 
University (ISU), where she completed the Space Studies Program. In 2001, Tremblay 
joined the CSA’s systems engineering group, where she worked as senior engineer 
and technical manager in the context of international and complex space explora-
tion projects, namely, the Canadian contributions to the NASA’s Phoenix Mars lander 
mission, which operated on Mars in 2008, and the James Webb Space Telescope, 
which will be launched in 2018. More recently, she was manager of the projects/
program portfolio and headed the CSA’s Corporate Investment Management Office, 
where she led the development and implementation of the new Canadian Space 
Agency project governance and monitoring framework and other initiatives, with 
the objective of improving the CSA’s organizational project management capacity. 
She was recently appointed as the Director, Astronauts, Life Sciences and Space 
Medicine.

Tremblay is currently on the board of directors for the PMI-Montreal, a chapter of 
the Project Management Institute. Over the years, she has been involved in numer-
ous initiatives for popularizing and promoting science and technology among young 
people and the general public.
Bruce Harpham: How did you first become interested in the space field?
Isabelle Tremblay: It was a lifelong dream for me. As a child, I was fasci-
nated by space exploration. I read books about it all the time. At the time of 
the Voyager 1 launch in 1977 [the first human spacecraft to leave the solar 
system], I was five years old. That mission certainly inspired me about the 
possibilities of space. I knew from an early age that I had to be involved in the 
space field.
Harpham: The Voyager mission in particular stands out as an inspiration?
Tremblay: In addition to Voyager, there were a few other sources of 
­inspiration. Before I learned how to read, I received a book on space [a French 
translation of Moon, Sun, and Stars (New True Book) by John Bryan Lewellen]. 
I still keep the book in my office. One section explains the phases of the Moon. 
It looked fascinating and I wanted to understand what it was. I was highly 
motivated to learn to read so that I could read that book!
If I had to think of a single moment that made the difference, it was meeting 
an astronaut as a child. My father is an electrical engineer and he took me 
to his office one day, in the 1980s, because they had a special guest visiting. It 
was an astronaut, if I remember correctly. He talked about his training and 
experiences with the space program. It was an exciting experience yet also 
intimidating. I was the only child in the room. I was so impressed with him that 
I could barely say anything beyond hello.
My father was also a major source of inspiration. I was fascinated by science 
and technology, in general, and he took the time to answer my questions and 
encourage me.
Harpham: What are some of your personal “rules of thumb” that you’ve 
developed to manage projects?
Tremblay: It’s important to have the courage to make hard decisions on 
projects as soon as possible. When there is a persistent issue or some other 
problem, it’s tough to make adjustments to a project’s scope. When you work 
on science missions as I do, our clients are scientists who depend on our 
­projects to carry out their research. Personally, one of my career motivations 
to work in the space field is that I wanted to enable scientists to explore 
space. Therefore, my team and I are highly motivated to give as much perfor-
mance as we can on the projects and technologies we create.
Of course, our ability to deliver these capabilities is constrained by cost and 
schedule. For example, we may have a mass problem with a spacecraft ­system. 

Project Managers at Work
43
In simple terms, the spacecraft may be too heavy with too many different 
instruments. On the Phoenix mission, we had to reduce the mass of our 
instruments. It was very difficult to make the choice to remove [or descope] 
components and capabilities, because it was still quite early in the project. 
Usually in the preliminary design stage, given the low level of definition, it’s 
recommended to retain some margin to make sure that your instruments will 
fit within the mass, volume, and power requirements that have been allocated. 
Unfortunately, that margin was reduced due to other changes on the project. 
In this example, “descoping” meant reducing the scientific capabilities of the 
system to fit within the requirements. That meant disappointing scientists and 
researchers to a degree.
If you delay difficult decisions on your project, including where you have to 
compromise on requirements from a stakeholder, that will likely make the 
project more difficult for you, since usually the more you wait, the more con-
strained the decision space or alternatives become. Unfortunately, you don’t 
have full and complete information when you make these difficult decisions. 
For example, you have no idea if your allocation on the spacecraft will be 
increased again in the future. You cannot count on the unknown or be overly 
optimistic about future conditions to avoid the discipline of making hard 
­decisions. You have to accept some uncertainty and risk.
Harpham: That’s a great principle to guide your approach to project  
decisions. Do you have guiding principles in relating to other people on the 
project?
Tremblay: It’s important to compose diverse teams, as well as seek out and 
listen to people who have different opinions and views than yours. They spot 
problems and opportunities that you may not be aware of. You may not be 
able to achieve a perfect consensus on the project. In those cases, you and the 
team have to accept that the solution is not perfect, accept the residual risk, 
and move on.
Harpham: Let’s look at project decision making given uncertainty. How do 
you approach those situations, especially when you know you have to make a 
decision to move ahead?
Tremblay: The key is to be transparent in communication: share all the 
information you have—and respect all opinions—to cultivate trust within the 
team. It’s human nature to be uncomfortable with uncertainty. It’s much easier 
to make decisions when you have all of the facts, but that’s not always possible. 
When you share information, and have a reputation for transparency, it’s much 
easier to accept uncertainty.
On the James Webb Space Telescope project, we faced a situation where an 
instrument had to be completely redesigned. As we were struggling through 
these issues, new technology became available that helped us to achieve our 
scientific objectives in a different way. These changes required completely

44
thinking through the project and revising the specifications for the instru-
ment. We also maintained flexibility in the definition and design process so 
that further refinements could be made efficiently to meet a very constrained 
schedule.
Harpham: Let’s look at the James Webb Space Telescope in more depth. 
Overall, what was the objective of the telescope project and what was your 
role on it?
Tremblay: The James Webb Space Telescope is the successor to the Hubble 
Space Telescope. It will observe the universe in a different spectrum than 
Hubble and will be seven times more powerful. Hubble can see the near 
infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. James Webb will see near-infrared and 
mid-infrared light. That capability is interesting because it will be able to see 
through dust clouds surrounding objects to better observe their structure 
and understand how they form. The telescope will able to see much further 
into space, see the very first stars and galaxies, and provide greater detail. 
With this telescope, we’ll also be able to “travel back in time,” and see the 
universe as it was after the first 100 million years following the Big Bang.
The scientific objective of the telescope is to help us to better understand 
the origins of the universe: how the first stars formed, how the first galaxies 
formed, and so forth. We also want to look at exoplanets—planets beyond 
our solar system. One of the Canadian instruments on the telescope, called 
NIRISS—the Near Infra-Red Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, will provide 
capability to directly observe exoplanets and study their composition. We can 
also look at the question of whether life could exist on those planets.
Harpham: This telescope sounds like it will be a major leap forward.
Tremblay: Definitely! It’s interesting if we compare it to Hubble. Originally, 
Hubble was designed to last for about five years. It ended up lasting much 
longer. [Hubble was launched in 1990 and it has been in service for over 20 
years.] With the James Webb telescope, we will be able to gather much more 
information about the universe and explore new questions. The planned 
launch date for the telescope is 2018.
Harpham: What was your role on the James Webb Space Telescope?
Tremblay: I worked on the Canadian contribution to the telescope as the 
lead systems engineer [i.e., technical manager] for the Canadian Space Agency. 
The CSA invested $37 million in the Canadian contribution to the Phoenix 
mission (the Meteorological station). The number of people directly involved 
in the project varied though project phases, from about 10 to 40.
We worked on two instruments: the FGS [Fine Guidance Sensor] and the 
NIRISS [Near-InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph]. The Fine Guidance 
Sensor looks at a given area of the sky, compares that data to a catalog, 
identifies star patterns or constellations, choses a guiding star, and provides

­telescope positioning information with an accuracy of a millionth of a degree. 
If the observatory is kept stable and focused, then we are able to obtain excel-
lent images for research. Without stability, you will get blurred images.
Harpham: Looking back on your work on this project, what was surprising 
about the telescope?
Tremblay: Prior to working on the telescope, I worked on the Phoenix mis-
sion, which was also an international mission bringing together scientists from 
all over the world. When I joined the James Webb Space Telescope project, 
the project had reached the detailed engineering phase. This was different 
from Phoenix, where I was involved from the beginning to the end [i.e., from 
feasibility studies to operations].
The James Webb Space Telescope project was distinctive due to the size of the 
team working on it. It was an order of magnitude larger than previous projects 
I had worked on. For example, we had large workshops during which we held 
science, technical, and project management meetings with a large number of 
stakeholders. At one of the workshops, there were well over two hundred 
participants. When I inquired about the size of the project team, I was told 
that the workshop attendance represented about ten percent of the team 
members. This means that a few thousands of people—from space agen-
cies, universities, and industry—were working on the project. In addition, this 
project required working remotely with people based in different locations 
around the world, mainly in the United States, Europe, and Canada.
Harpham: Let’s look at the stakeholder management aspect of the project. 
How do you approach engaging and leading such a large number of stakeholders?
Tremblay: It’s a challenge. However, we have a few advantages that make the 
whole process easier. We work with a group of people who are passionate 
and highly engaged in the project—scientists, engineers, and others who are 
enjoying their dream jobs. I also found that holding regular face-to-face meet-
ings makes a major difference to build trusting and lasting relationships.
Conducting meetings and conference calls is a challenging area in some 
cases. I find that tightly focused and specialized meetings tend to be the most 
­productive. When you have a broader subject to cover in a meeting, and it is 
necessary to involve a more diverse group of participants, that breadth means 
the meeting tends to be somewhat less efficient for the participants, timewise.
Harpham: Do you face challenges in terms of holding conference calls with 
people from different time zones around the world?
Tremblay: For the most part, the projects I contributed to involved working 
mainly with American team members. Therefore, the time zones were only a 
few hours apart at the most.

Harpham: Let’s turn to the Phoenix mission. What was your contribution 
to this Mars project?
Tremblay: The Phoenix mission was proposed in the context of the NASA 
Scout Mission Program, an initiative where a competitive process was con-
ducted to select relatively low-cost science missions, with a budget of around 
400 million US dollars, complementing major billion-dollar Mars missions. 
These smaller missions were led by a principal investigator. That scientist 
would assemble a team to design and perform the mission. A Canadian com-
pany—MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.—was part of the team led 
by Peter Smith, the principal investigator who submitted a proposal to NASA. 
This proposal for the Phoenix Mars lander won the competition! Once the 
competition was awarded, the Canadian Space Agency became involved and 
sponsored the Canadian contribution. Although I followed the competition 
very closely, I really became involved when the CSA entered the project.
Harpham: What was the scientific objective of the Phoenix mission?
Tremblay: In brief, the mission was to look at the habitability of Mars. 
Scientists wanted to know whether Mars could have once supported life. To 
answer that question, we look for signs or traces of life as we know it. We 
know what life looks like on Earth and use that knowledge to guide our search 
for life elsewhere. For example, we look for sources of energy that life could 
use and byproducts of life, like methane.
NASA’s motto at the time was “follow the water.” They were looking for 
water in the solar system as a clue to finding life. The mission went to the 
northern part of Mars, in an area called Vastitas Borealis, at about seventy 
degrees of latitude, which is very close to the North Pole. We were looking 
for water ice in that area that had been detected before by the Mars Odyssey 
orbiter.
The Canadian contribution to Phoenix was a meteorological station. It looked 
at the atmosphere to measure clouds’ dust content, diurnal and seasonal 
cycles, and related phenomena. Phoenix landed on Mars in May 2008 and it 
ended up lasting several months, until November 2008. Originally, Phoenix 
was planned to run for three months. Since the mission was very successful, 
it was extended over five months. Eventually, with the Martian fall coming,  
and the sun lower on the horizon, the Phoenix’s solar panels could not collect 
enough energy to continue operations, and one day we lost communication 
with the lander.
Harpham: What happened after you lost communication with Phoenix?
Tremblay: Most probes to Mars had landed near the equator. Phoenix 
landed in the far northern part of the planet. In that area, part of the north 
polar ice cap, the temperatures go very low during the winter [below –100°C] 
and a thick layer of dry [carbon dioxide] ice accumulates on the ground.

The Phoenix lander wasn’t designed to survive the Martian winter. Scientists 
expected that the lander would become completely covered with ice in the 
winter season. Later on, images taken from Mars orbit showed that Phoenix 
was badly damaged by the winter.
Overall, Phoenix was a highly successful mission. It landed safely on Mars, 
operated longer than planned, and all mission objectives were met.
Harpham: What was your approach to risk management on this project?
Tremblay: Risk management is an important aspect of any space mission. 
We used several methods to assess risk on the project and set aside sufficient 
reserves to manage the risk. We think a lot about what could go wrong, and 
compromise a mission to develop our risk management plan. Throughout 
the project, we reassess risk continuously based on changes to requirements, 
issues that occur, and other factors.
Harpham: How do you approach managing unknown risks? Risk manage-
ment often uses historical events and loss events for analysis, but that approach 
does not address new and unprecedented risks.
Tremblay: We have to keep reserves for the unknown. Fortunately, we have 
great information from previous space missions that guide our planning and 
risk management. No single team will have a comprehensive knowledge of 
possible risks. Multi-agency missions have the benefit of a wider understand-
ing. The Canadian Space Agency’s risk management approach is also well 
informed by our partnership with NASA.
We have comprehensive project reviews at each phase of the project that 
include a risk discussion. Those reviews are supported by experts from out-
side the project who challenge every aspect of the project. We’re never com-
pletely successful in predicting the unknown, but we’re getting better each 
time. It’s critical to have the right people in the room on the project review 
meetings. In addition to experts, we have lessons learned databases to inform 
our approach.
In addition, we have some technical methods to explore and reduce risk and 
the unknown. We use simulations to verify if the systems we design will meet 
the required performance. For example, we develop structural and thermal 
software models and simulations to verify if a proposed design can survive the 
launch vibrations and extreme temperatures to which it will be exposed in 
space. Over the course of the project, we also build a series of prototypes of 
increasing fidelity, and subject them to various tests. We test these models in 
a simulated space environment. A good principle is to “test as you fly”: make 
your testing conditions as close to the actual mission as possible. In space 
projects, there is no margin for error. Once a spacecraft is launched, we can-
not generally fix it, aside from implementing some relatively minor software 
workarounds remotely.

Harpham: This gives me a sense of some of the risk management strategies 
and techniques you use. For example, bring in outside experts to provide new 
perspectives on risk at project reviews. Invite the internal team to challenge 
each other on risk. Finally, continuously identify new risk areas as the project 
unfolds rather than limiting that activity to the start of the project.
Tremblay: We always have to monitor risks, update our risk database, reas-
sess likelihood and impact, and reconsider mitigation measures.
When issues arise, we link them back to risks that were anticipated. Or we 
take note of it where it was an “unknown unknown.” We continuously eval-
uate if we have enough resources to deliver the project given known and 
potential issues or risks.
Harpham: One of your past assignments at the Canadian Space Agency was 
leading the Corporate Investment Management Office. What was the pur-
pose of the project, and what was achieved?
Tremblay: My role was to improve the organization’s project management 
capacity. When I started in that role in April 2014, we were in the ­process 
of developing a new project management framework—the investment 
­governance and monitoring framework. It’s based on leading best practices 
and the Canadian government’s requirements for projects to achieve value for 
money, demonstrate sound stewardship of funds, and ensure ­accountability and 
­delivery of project outcomes within time and cost constraints. The fact that 
the US government recently adopted new legislation on project ­management 
is of particular interest, since it is a natural and important partner for Canada. 
In Canada, policies and requirements for the management of projects are 
established by the Treasury Board Secretariat. They are similar to US legisla-
tion and requirements.
In addition, standards from the Treasury Board Secretariat, a part of the 
Canadian government, require assessing the risk and complexity of projects 
and an organization’s capability to carry them out. Here’s how it works: you 
start by assessing the project management capacity of an organization. Then, 
you evaluate the risk and complexity of a project. If the result of this evalua-
tion exceeds the assessed capacity of the organization, then you need to seek 
Treasury Board approval to undertake the project.
When I arrived, the CSA was developing a framework to implement the 
Government of Canada’s project management policy requirements. We 
developed a stage-gate model for projects. In addition, I was involved with 
developing new monitoring and reporting tools for the agency’s projects.
Harpham: Would you need to call the Minister for approval at a certain 
level?
Tremblay: We don’t directly call the Minister. For anything major that goes 
to the Treasury Board, the Minister is informed and involved in the decision 

Project Managers at Work
49
that the CSA will undertake those projects. Every project has to be strategi-
cally aligned and have a business case to justify it. During my assignment at 
the Corporate Investment Management Office, I also had the opportunity to 
observe the executive committee in action as they reviewed investment pro-
posals and made decisions about which projects to approve.
Harpham: What aspect of this project management governance change has 
been most beneficial to the organization?
Tremblay: The new governance committee has a challenge function. It 
challenges all requests for new investments and monitors the progress of 
approved projects. Essentially, project teams benefit from the broad experi-
ence and diverse expertise of senior executives composing our governance 
committee. They provide valuable inputs and raise important questions about 
the projects we’re considering. The stage-gate process has also been benefi-
cial. Before undertaking each stage or phase of a project, you must pass a gate 
and obtain a decision from the organization’s leadership to move forward with 
the next phase. The governance committee challenges the proposed project 
plan [I.e. scope, cost, schedule, and risks] to ensure that the project team can 
deliver as expected, per the plan, with confidence.
At the same time, the governance or challenge function is perceived as a 
constraint. It introduces more steps to undertake and review projects. There 
is also a challenge to present the right level of detail to the leadership, which 
is required to enable informed decision-making by our senior executives. 
However, this healthy challenge function is essential, in particular in the gov-
ernment context, where we are spending public funds.
Harpham: What is the approach to communicating with the executives on 
this governing body? Engineers and scientists may be interested in all of the 
technical details, while executives may prefer a high-level summary highlighting 
key decision factors.
Tremblay: Absolutely. We have a series of dashboard reports that summarize 
our projects and projects’ performance for the leadership. These reports have 
standardized metrics or indicators designed to inform senior executives about 
project scope, cost, schedule, risks, and issues. If there’s a desire to add more 
information to reports, we question whether adding more detail is helpful. The 
key questions become: Why are we reporting this information? How is it help-
ful to our executives to make a decision? Is it helpful for an executive to know 
that “project X passed a test readiness review”? What does that mean? Is it an 
important achievement, and why? What is the significance of that point?
There are also reporting requirements that go beyond our agency. For 
­example, we have to inform other government departments, and their senior 
executives, up to the Deputy Minister’s level, on our activities. How do we 
report the right information to those audiences with the right level of detail? 
That’s all part of this new project management framework.

Harpham: What does your personal productivity system look like in terms 
of habits, goal setting, and organization?
Tremblay: In a leadership role, my priority is the team and the organization. 
It is to create and maintain the conditions that will contribute to our suc-
cess. The other important aspect is to clearly and concisely articulate and 
communicate our purpose—the vision, mandate, and measurable objectives 
for the team. This facilitates cohesion, communication, and efficiency. Keeping 
the momentum is also key—by creating short term-wins and incrementally 
delivering on commitments.
Harpham: What books have you found most valuable for your professional 
growth?
Tremblay: Books on leadership mainly. Leadership can be expressed at all 
levels of an organization. Two books stand out: Simon Sinek, Start with Why: 
How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action [Portfolio, 2009] and Leaders 
Eat Last [Portfolio, 2014]. I also like reading on how to foster a growth mindset 
in individuals and organizations.
Harpham: Let’s turn to the future. What’s on the horizon for space science 
and exploration for the next several years?
Tremblay: We live in exciting times for space exploration. Efforts to com-
mercialize activities in low Earth orbit will intensify over the next few years. 
The commercial sector is getting more active in space, and that brings faster 
progress. In the next ten years, I think we’ll see space tourism develop and 
more humans than ever before will go into space. As low Earth orbit becomes 
commercialized, humans will travel further in the solar system. We will be able 
to explore the solar system, including the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Human 
space exploration is more than an adventure—it’s the expression of our pro-
pensity to explore the unknown. It is deeply rooted in and intrinsically stems 
from our survival instinct. It may seem far-fetched, but going into space, and 
extending human presence beyond Earth, is the future of humanity.
The Canadian Space Agency will be involved in these projects and missions 
in the future as well. In 2017, there’s an astronaut recruitment campaign cur-
rently underway in Canada. That’s a good sign! One of our astronauts, David 
Saint-Jacques, will also be the third Canadian to participate in a long-duration 
mission on the International Space Station. We’re also preparing for the next 
big step in exploration, and the future of human spaceflight in deep space, 
pushing the limits of our capabilities and inspiring the next generation of 
Canadians to pursue science and technology.

Andy Kaufman, PMP, is an international speaker, author, and executive coach, 
and president of the Institute for Leadership Excellence & Development Inc. He 
works with organizations around the world, helping them improve their ability to 
deliver projects and lead teams. He also teaches project management at Loyola 
University’s Quinlan School of Business in Chicago. Kaufman is the author of three 
books: Navigating the Winds of Change (Zurich Press, 2003), How to Organize Your 
Inbox & Get Rid of E-Mail Clutter (Zurich Press, 2007), and Shining the Light on The 
Secret (Zurich Press, 2007).
Prior to starting the Institute for Leadership Excellence & Development Inc., Kaufman 
was vice president of US Systems at ACNielsen. He started his career as a software 
developer at Brokerage Systems Inc. He earned a bachelor’s of science degree in 
business data processing from Northern Michigan University.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
Andy Kaufman: As with a lot of project managers I work with, I didn’t set 
out to become a project manager. After graduating from college, I started as 
a software developer. Inevitably, software development projects came up but 
we didn’t think of them as formal projects. We thought of it as “we have a 
release date and we’ve got to find a way to do it.” My bosses at the time were 
not called “project managers.”

When I was promoted to my first management role, I was managing people 
who used to be my peers. There were a lot of challenges with that. I made 
all kinds of mistakes. Over time, I realized there can be joy in organizing a 
group of people to accomplish something. At the time, I wasn’t reading the 
PMBOK Guide or following stage gate methodologies. I was clueless about 
best practices. However, taking a group of people and working with them is 
really rewarding! In fact, I found that more rewarding than delivering a piece 
of work by myself!
What I love about project management is that we don’t just talk about stuff. 
We have the opportunity to deliver. That is fun! It doesn’t generally take us 
years to deliver either. We get to deliver on a regular basis. I’m the kind of 
guy that gets a rush from checking off a to-do. There is a set of to-dos when  
I complete a project, so it brings a great sense of accomplishment.
Harpham: People who are achievement oriented and like to ship work out 
the door tend to like projects. I also find there’s a strong tension between 
task-oriented project managers and people-oriented project managers.
Kaufman: I think there’s room for both task- and people-oriented approaches 
in projects given the sheer variety of industries and organizations.
Harpham: Can you share an example of an early project you worked on 
when you were “green” as a project manager?
Kaufman: In my first job, I was hired as a programmer. I soon moved into 
another role—manager of product development at Baxter. The cool thing 
about that job: we were writing software that IBM put their name on. We 
could go to a store and see our product on the shelf. There’s something cool 
about being in the business of creating things and seeing how it helps other 
people.
In this role, IBM had big expectations for the product, which was automation 
software for physician offices. There were deadlines, performance reviews, 
and political issues in dealing with Baxter and IBM. It was eye-opening. It made 
me realize how stupid I was when I got out of college.
Harpham: What do you mean by “stupid”?
Kaufman: In college, I learned how to develop flow charts, and about 
­programming languages and theory. I don’t feel like college prepared me for 
the people side of work, organizational politics, influencing skills, and other 
workplace realities. Of course, we have to be good technically—write good 
code and understand requirements, for example. Unfortunately, I did a ­horrible 
job with the first performance reviews I did as a manager. I gave construc-
tive feedback on issues where I also struggled, so there was some challenge 
around my credibility to give feedback.

I faced the question: what does it mean to lead? Fundamentally, I learned that 
leading doesn’t mean “bossing people around.” Early on, I had a mental model 
about what it meant to be a boss or a leader. My job is to inspire and motivate, 
not to point out mistakes, act bossy, or pretend that I know everything. That 
job helped me understand that I’m there to serve and help the team. I learned 
the value of tapping into mentors as well. There were a few people who were 
fifteen or twenty years ahead of me and I learned a lot from them.
Harpham: What did you learn from these mentors?
Kaufman: I learned that if you really listen to more experienced people—
whether they are five or twenty years more experienced—there are valuable 
lessons to learn. There are technical lessons, people management lessons, and 
more.
From Rick, I learned about his approach to structuring programming code in 
a certain way so that it would be easy to maintain and adjust in the future.
From Bob, one of my bosses, I learned about different approaches to docu-
mentation. There was a request for documentation for some of the modules 
in the product. I was young and ambitious, so I volunteered to do it. Bob said, 
“No, I know exactly what they need.” He must have printed off three or four 
boxes worth of documentation. When I pointed out, “They’re never going to 
read that much documentation,” he simply replied, “That’s exactly right!”
He understood the difference between what was being asked for and what 
was really needed. I had a lot of fun during that time and made a lot of mis-
takes in learning how to lead the team. Even today, I’m thankful for those early 
days where I first moved into a management role and developed to the skills 
to manage people successfully.
Harpham: What did you learn about office politics at this stage? Some people  
dismiss this concept with the thinking that “I should just be able to execute 
my tasks and that should be it.” On the other side, nobody wants to become a 
master manipulator like Frank Underwood from House of Cards where you’re 
pushing people into the subway tunnel.
Kaufman: Here’s a lesson I learned about office politics early on. There’s 
a natural tension between those who promise things and those who had to 
deliver on the promises. In almost every industry, there’s that tension between 
the project people who have to deliver and the sales or business development 
group who sell the work.
The dirty little secret of business is relationships. If a project manager has 
strong rapport with people across the organization, it makes a huge differ-
ence. At Baxter, I knew a marketing person who was definitely a “climber.”  
I always felt like I couldn’t quite trust her. I’ll call her “Julie.” It became apparent 
that if I got to know Julie better outside of work discussions on requirements, 
due dates, and the like—that Julie became nicer in meetings!

Chapter 5 | Andy Kaufman, President, Institute for Leadership Excellence & 
Development Inc.
56
Julie was not warm and fuzzy at all. Yet, you could get her talking about her 
interests and then we could connect. I realized that building relationships and 
bridges across organizational boundaries makes a big difference.
Over the years, I’ve come to realize that “office politics” really comes down 
to relationships. I’ve realized that people are driven by different things and we 
can use that information to work better with them. When you can help other 
people achieve their goals, then you can work with them on their level.
Let’s think of politics as “the way things get done in organizations.” Get out of 
your office or cubicle and build relationships! I learned a lot from interviewing 
Herminia Ibarra about her book Act Like a Leader, Think Like a Leader [Harvard 
Business Review Press, 2015]. When it comes to networking and building 
relationships, people tend to build connections with people similar to them. 
If you’re a business analyst, you probably hang out with the other business 
analysts. Building relationships more broadly is part of the job even though it 
requires more effort to go beyond your immediate department.
Harpham: If you’re highly task oriented, you could add a task to your to-do 
list, like: Go for morning coffee and invite someone I haven’t talked to this 
week.
Kaufman: At one of my workshops, I suggest putting together a list of people 
and start connecting with them. Make it simple: once a month, invite someone 
from that list to lunch or coffee. Otherwise, you will tend to hang around 
people who are just like you, day in and day out.
Harpham:  You’ve built on your early experiences with mentorship by 
expanding into teaching workshops in the corporate world and courses 
at Loyola University Chicago’s Quinlan School of Business. What have you 
learned from that teaching experience?
Kaufman: Teaching has helped me to understand project management more 
deeply. I coach other people to become better project managers. That means 
I have to stay sharp on project methods and ideas. As a result, I’ve developed 
the habit to keep learning and constantly think of ways to communicate these 
ideas so that the other person really gets it. I owe a huge debt to all of my 
teachers because I didn’t appreciate all the effort that goes into teaching well.
At Loyola’s business school, I teach a project management course as part of 
a healthcare MBA program. It’s a room filled with doctors, administrators 
and other smart people. They generally don’t think of themselves as project 
managers. I love the experience of seeing students understand the practicality 
of project management principles to their profession. My favorite compliment 
is hearing from students after the course that they’re using the ideas and 
­concepts in their work.
Recently, I was teaching a course at a financial services organization and ran 
into someone over the lunch break. She had taken one of my courses a few 
years prior and she told me, “I took your course a few years ago and got 

Project Managers at Work
57
promoted!” I made the point to her: you got promoted because you put 
the learning into action. When someone embraces the learning, and achieves 
great results—well, it doesn’t get any better than that.
I’ve taught project management to the United Nations, large companies, and 
small companies. The problems are all very similar in those organizations. 
Learning to apply best practices does yield results and better value. Project 
managers also have a unique opportunity to build credibility because we make 
promises to deliver and then we either live up to that or we don’t. Delivering 
projects successfully means bigger challenges, opportunities, and projects.  
I love that about our profession.
Harpham: What was it like to teach project management at the United 
Nations?
Kaufman: My favorite part of working with the UN is the cultural challenge. 
Though I have taught workshops on every continent except Antarctica, I’ve 
spent most of my corporate career delivering projects in North America. 
I appreciate that there are differences within different parts of the United 
States—the East Coast, the Midwest, and the West Coast. At the UN, how-
ever, there are far greater cultural differences and capabilities. The people  
I work with at the UN bring excellent skills to the table including fluency in 
multiple languages.
In North America, we might talk about software projects or a process change. 
In contrast, UN project managers are organizing a new government after a 
national crisis. Or providing services to refugees in the aftermath of a natural 
disaster. The stakes are huge. Regardless of the situation, understanding what 
you’re trying to deliver and putting a reasonable plan to deliver given your 
constraints are the name of the game. It’s the same blocking and tackling in 
projects whether you’re doing an intervention to help refugees or build soft-
ware. In the UN, the projects aim to have an impact that will last for genera-
tions rather than boosting quarterly earnings at a corporation. That’s inspiring 
for me—to know that I’m helping people to deliver success.
Harpham: Today you run your own project management consulting and 
training company. How did you get started? Where did the first few clients 
come from?
Kaufman: Even to this day, I’m still a software developer at heart. I like to 
break problems down and have an organized approach to thinking problems 
through. That thinking carried me through several promotions up to the vice 
president level. With each of those steps, you look at the next step in the path 
and then you ask yourself: “Do I really want to do that?” As a vice president of 
systems, I truthfully don’t think I was awesome at the role and I didn’t enjoy it 
as much as other roles. Careerwise, I asked myself: “What am I good at? What 
do I enjoy? And what can I make money at?” You need all three of those points 
to build a successful career in my view.

I started speaking at conferences and was surprised when one actually paid! 
It wasn’t enough to build a viable business but it allowed me to interact with 
people who did speaking and training full time, such as Karl Weigers, a pro-
lific author and speaker in the software development arena some years back. 
When I learned that you could actually build a career in speaking and training, 
I asked them how they did it and how they found customers. This was prepa-
ration and research I did long before I left my full-time job.
I’m reminded of an insight from Adam Grant’s book, Originals [Viking, 2016]. 
There’s a perception that people who start a business take massive risks. He 
provides compelling evidence that many entrepreneurs start their business 
“on the side.” I started my business on the side by speaking at conferences 
while I still had my job. I found my voice, figured out what I like to speak on, 
and determined what people value.
In 2001, I participated in a two-day coaching session with Joe Miraglia,  
former senior vice president of HR at Motorola—that covered life purpose 
and planning. At the end of it, he told me, “I think you can run your own  
business. Based on what you’ve done in the past and your temperament, you 
can do it. However, you need twelve months of living expenses in cash in the 
bank before you go into it full time.” At that time, I had about six months of 
liquid cash, so I was feeling down because it would take a lot longer to further 
build up my savings.
At the same time, I was having the “what do you want to do when you grow 
up” conversation with my boss at ACNielsen. I told him about my vision. It 
turns out that I was able to receive a six-month severance package because 
they were going through a downsizing process. I thought I had shot myself in 
the foot by suggesting that I leave the company. It turned out to be great tim-
ing: the company had to downsize but they had not had a voluntary separation 
program. It turned out to be a win-win: they didn’t have an ugly process of 
letting people go and I received what I wanted for my purposes.
I drive by the offices of ACNielsen from time to time. I say “thank you” to 
myself because that process helped me to launch my company as I pass by.
I launched the company on a full time basis in August 2001, shortly before the 
9/11 attacks. I did what I knew to win business: I went to my network and 
made sales. I did a lot of subcontracting for training companies at that time 
who provided project management.
During that first year of business, there were good months and some months 
where I made nothing. It took about thirteen months to really get the business 
going, so I’m grateful for the advice to have twelve months’ worth of savings in 
the bank. It’s the same advice I’d give to anyone starting a business or search-
ing for a job after a lay off. Hopefully, it wouldn’t actually take that long but that 
planning assumption gives you peace of mind.

It took a while to get used to variable income each month. But I love what  
I get to do on a daily basis. I don’t think I could do what I’m doing in a traditional 
job.
Harpham: How long did you run the business “on the side”?
Kaufman: I started the business on the side in 1994 and went full time on 
the business in 2001.
It all started at ACNielsen when I was running a project using some innova-
tive technology from Microsoft. In February 1994, I got a call from someone 
at Microsoft who said, “We have a TechEd conference coming up. Would you 
come and present a short case study during one of the keynotes?” At that 
time, if I had to present in front of ten people, I was a wreck and couldn’t sleep 
the night before. This would be in front of 7,500 people!
However, I said yes to the invitation even though I was nervous about it. I had 
two weeks to prepare the presentation and worked with a coach to help me 
develop my skills. It was the scariest five minutes of my professional life up 
to that time. The presentation went well enough that they invited me to give 
an hour long version of the presentation at another conference. I had a very 
supportive boss who reasoned, “Your conference presentations earn good 
press for our company and help us with hiring new people.” The conference 
organizers often paid for travel expenses so there wasn’t a burden for the 
company. I also had a supportive spouse in making the transition to a full-time 
business.
Harpham: So this wasn’t a case of tinkering for a few weeks and then quit-
ting your job?
Kaufman: It was years in the making in my case. You don’t have to take mas-
sive risks to start a business. It’s just like risk management on a project. You 
identify the risks and come up with mitigation plans. In retrospect, I wish that 
I had made the leap two or three years earlier.
The bottom line for me: I didn’t want to be eighty years old someday and 
regret not starting my own business. Another point was that I had just turned 
forty. John G. Miller, author of QBQ! [TarcherPerigee, 2004], was a mentor 
for me at the time. His view at the time was that you’re not ready to start a 
­company until you’re forty. There are plenty of examples to the contrary—
however, his comment resonated with me. The fundamental idea is that you 
want to understand yourself, have learned enough, and have developed enough 
supportive relationships in order to start a business.
In my podcasting work, Cornelius Fichtner has been incredibly generous to 
me with his insights and suggestions. I’ve been surrounded by people who 
have been generous with ideas and support, if I was willing to ask. That’s a 
good lesson for all of us.

Harpham: In your podcast, The People and Projects Podcast, you bring great 
positive energy and enthusiasm to each episode. It really shines through your 
work. Does that energy and drive come naturally?
Kaufman: Some people think that I’m an extrovert because of the podcast. 
That’s not true at all. Depending on the assessment, I usually come out as an 
introvert or borderline extrovert. That said, I really love this work and I’m 
guessing it’s this passion for the profession that comes through as energy. 
You don’t have to be a raving extrovert to run a successful kick off meeting. 
It really helps if you like the project! If you can find meaning in your project 
work, your enthusiasm will become infectious.
Harpham: How have you gone about developing your leadership skills as an 
introvert?
Kaufman: There’s a spectrum or scale between highly extroverted and highly 
introverted. In the middle of that range, you have people called “ambiverts” 
that have both qualities.
When I teach this concept, I ask my students where they think the best sales 
professionals rank on that scale of highly introverted to highly extroverted. 
They usually assume sales professionals are highly extroverted and the best 
actuaries are highly introverted. Interestingly, there’s some compelling research 
suggesting ambiverts rule the world! They have a mixture of both tendencies. 
The challenge with highly extroverted people is that they struggle to shut up 
while highly introverted people don’t speak up enough. So there is a down-
side to both tendencies.
This research gave me comfort to be myself and “ramp it up” when I need to 
deliver. In an interview or delivering a training program, I know I need to bring 
energy to deliver a quality educational experience.
However, I learned that introverts need to have time and space to recharge. 
That’s one of the great insights I picked up from Susan Cain’s book Quiet 
[Crown, 2012]. Over the next few days, I’m going to deliver day long train-
ing sessions to a group of people. Over the lunch break, I go off by myself 
to recharge—I don’t talk to a single person. I tell the people in the class up 
front, “I would love to have lunch with you but I need to go off by myself to 
recharge.” When you position it like that, people understand it. Giving myself 
space and time to recharge makes all the difference.
When I used to be quiet in meetings, I learned a “hack”: early in the meeting, 
speak up. The longer I stay quiet in the meeting, the more likely I will stay 
quiet all the way to the end. Even if it’s just asking a question, it’s a way to 
engage. That’s a way to manage my natural inclination to sit back and be quiet.
At the other end of the spectrum, extroverts need to learn ways to improve 
their listening skills. There are times when listening more and speaking less 
makes a critical difference in effectively connecting with other people. If they 
do that, they will be more effective.

Project Managers at Work
61
Harpham: It’s like training for a marathon. Your training run doesn’t go all 
day. You go hard at it for an hour and then you do other things for the rest 
of the day.
Kaufman: You don’t have to pretend to be an Olympic runner. You’re ramp-
ing it up to do what is necessary to achieve the goal.
Harpham: What advice would you give to the reader who has been on a 
project team and they’re interested in moving to the project manager role? 
How can they make that transition from their current role to a project 
­manager role?
Kaufman: I see the “accidental project manager” situation happen a lot 
where people are pulled into a project role. When people make a strategic 
career move into projects, they start spending time with people doing the 
work. They ask questions like, “What do you like about your job? How did 
you get to this job? What do you not like about the work?” Learning about 
the work and networking goes a long way. A lot of people have heard that 
suggestion before. The real point is “Are you strategically setting out to learn 
from other people? Are you putting these ideas into practice?”
I believe in the maxim “You don’t get it if you don’t ask.” Many people don’t 
ask for help or for opportunities. If you spend enough time with project man-
agers, you will learn whether you’re interested in the work or if it is right for 
you. After all, the work isn’t easy, there’s pressure and significant challenges. 
Through these conversations, you will find out if the career is right for you. 
You may also get invited to join one of their projects.
The standard advice is to volunteer for opportunities but it’s a tough idea to 
implement. You probably already have a full set of responsibilities and taking 
on more responsibilities feel unreasonable. Yet, it is a path that some people 
use successful to grow their career. Asking to take on a set of tasks and deliv-
ering that work builds your career credibility.
I honestly think that project management is a life skill. It’s far from a title. Just 
like time management, conflict management influencing skills are basic skill 
sets that need to be exercised to be a professional. Project management is like 
that. We all have work to deliver so it makes sense to use project manage-
ment skills to be successful, no matter your job title.
As you network more, realize that there will be a time in the future where you 
see a job posting and go for it. I would encourage readers to think, “Wow, this 
is a great rewarding way to make a living.”
Harpham: What are some of your personal productivity habits and methods 
that underpin your success?
Kaufman: As mentioned before, the single biggest lesson I’ve learned is that 
everything in business comes down to relationships. I’m just amazed that one 
stakeholder has the ability to create a lot of pain if there is a poor relationship. 

Chapter 5 | Andy Kaufman, President, Institute for Leadership Excellence &

I make an effort to learn more about people I work with because then I can 
customize my approach.
Generally, I like to be the one asking the questions and become curious about 
people. I even do this when I’m on a cruise or vacation. I like to ask people 
where they’re from, what they love about their job, and so forth. That skill 
set—having genuine curiosity about stakeholders—is critical to managing our 
projects. Some stakeholders may be obstacles at first glance but if we’re curi-
ous about them, we can discover what concerns they have. Likewise, if you 
have a teammate who is always making negative comments, it could be that 
they are the canary in the coal mine—they’re detecting problems that we 
need to be aware of.
In the last five years, I’ve learned the importance of testing your assumptions.
Harpham: What do you mean by testing assumptions?
Kaufman: People sometimes tell you, “Don’t assume!”. But in projects, that’s 
terrible advice. We always have assumptions. The question isn’t whether we 
have assumptions—rather, the question is to ask what those assumptions 
are based on. Do we have historical data? Have we checked those assump-
tions with other people? Do we update those assumptions as we get new 
information?
In my business, the traditional assumption is that you need to bring a person 
to your location to deliver training or consulting. Well, remote presentation 
technology keeps getting better and better, so I’m experimenting with those 
methods. That’s how I question my business model. Project management 
teaches you to question your assumptions and seek to come up with answers 
based on that. It’s a life skill to question, revise, and act because we have to act 
in conditions of uncertainty.
Recently, I’ve developed the habit of asking myself a few questions at the start 
of each day to guide my thinking. I learned this from interviewing Jim Kouzes 
about his book Learning Leadership [Wiley, 2016]. Jim suggests you start your 
day like this: “Who I am, what I do, and how I do it matters. What difference 
do I want to make today?” I think about who I’m going to meet with and how 
I can help them.
I also use productivity tools like to-do lists, mind mapping tools, and Getting 
Things Done author David Allen’s recommendation to put ideas on paper. Why 
try to remember it all when we have great tools to capture and manage 
information?
Harpham: Are there specific productivity tools that make a difference?
Kaufman: Evernote stands out. When I read a book, I put my notes in 
Evernote. When I’m with a client and have an idea to share, I can easily look 
up the idea from Evernote with a quick search. I also have a paper journal 

Project Managers at Work
63
for those cases where digital note taking isn’t practical. I also use Todoist for 
keeping track of tasks. I’m amazed at how fast I forget stuff, so it’s important 
to write it down in a format that I can search.
Harpham: What’s your perspective on lessons learned? Sometimes, I see 
these written in a vague way, such as “Mistakes were made.” That may be true, 
but it’s not very helpful. What important lesson have you learned in your 
career?
Kaufman: There are a number of them that come to mind. I remember 
reading the comment “if you have an unrealistic schedule, it’s your fault as the 
project manager” in Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep book’s section on time 
management. The PMBOK Guide may not put it that way but it is aligned with 
the PMI worldview. As project managers, we are responsible for this project.
If we’re given an unrealistic schedule, it’s our responsibility to point that out 
and negotiate so that we can be successful. Taking responsibility is near and 
dear to my heart right now because it seems like we have a whiny culture. If 
you listen to talk radio, news, or conversations at the workplace, we just com-
plain and point the finger. That often translates into doing nothing. If you take 
responsibility for a situation, even if it was not entirely of your own making, 
then you can make progress.
If you don’t like where you’re at in your career, do something about it. Don’t 
whine about it. You can get better! Life is short, so make the most of the time 
you have. Ask yourself: “What can I do given the current circumstances?" I’m 
far from perfect yet this principle has served me well in business and with my 
projects. It’s too easy to blame the stakeholder.
Harpham: I see the responsibility principle at play in meetings when ­someone 
says, “I will take on solving X.” People give you credit for moving the ball down 
the field. It will sometimes trigger people to get involved and support you.
Kaufman: Right. Take the view: I’m responsible to come up with a plan to 
move forward.
Harpham: Looking out over the next five years or so, what trends do you 
see impacting the practice of project management?
Kaufman: The biggest one is virtualization of teams. Concerns about work/
life balance and environmental concerns will mean greater support for remote 
work and work-from-home arrangements. Availability of talent is another rea-
son for remote work as more people retire from the workforce. Companies 
will increasingly need to tap into talent beyond their local area. Improving 
Internet bandwidth and other technologies also encourage this trend.
In my business, I want to get even better at presenting through ­collaboration 
tools like WebEx, Microsoft Lync, or other tools. Project managers at ­companies 
should ask, “How can I learn to run meetings through these technologies so it 

Chapter 5 | Andy Kaufman, President, Institute for Leadership Excellence & 
Development Inc.
64
is just as good as managing people down the hall?” Leading virtual teams just 
as effectively as local teams will become a superpower for project managers.
Harpham: Any closing thoughts on project management that we haven’t 
covered?
Kaufman: I’m intrigued by the challenge of using Scrum and similar approaches 
in new ways. For example, my son is in college right now and he has a heavy 
course load. I’ve taught him to use Scrum to manage his homework. He told 
me, “Dad, I’m two weeks ahead on the homework!” Thinking about ways to 
use project management methods and skills beyond the traditional project 
context is an interesting frontier to explore.
Ask yourself what trends are happening that you can take advantage of. 
There’s a wealth of learning resources such as books, e-learning tools and so 
on while you’re at your company. Podcasts are a great example—they are a 
great way to learn while you drive or do other activities. Years ago, Zig Ziglar 
used the phrase “automobile university” to encourage people to listen to 
audio ­programs while they drive. That approach is still effective today.

Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
Owen Gadeken: It was through the US military that I became involved 
in projects. It wasn’t my plan at all though. In college, I was studying to be a 
scientist. Unfortunately, I took out student loans during my studies. At the 
same time, the draft for the Vietnam War was in place and I had a low a draft 
number! So, I was looking around for options in the early 1970s.
I realized that if I joined the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps [ROTC] that  
I would have a choice where I served and that I would be an officer. I received 
an ROTC scholarship for the rest of my undergraduate education. The disci-
pline of the military aligned with the discipline and organization I knew from 
science and mathematics. After graduating, I was assigned to an Air Force 
research lab in Florida.
With my chemistry background, I worked on warheads and related materials. 
The lab was located at the far end of the airfield just in case anything hap-
pened. As it turns out, a few years after I left that base, there was an explosion 
in the lab! Thankfully that didn’t happen while I was there.
The military then changed its priorities away from the basic sciences area 
that was my focus. Instead, the government decided to send this “hands on” 
research and development work to industry. After working in the research lab 
for a year, I became an R&D project manager.
Later, there was a switch in emphasis to precision-guided weapons that used 
smaller warheads. This meant cancelling the entire project area I was working. 
As a result, I was transferred to the future planning section—we looked at all 
the equipment and weapons we had in the Air Force inventory and what was 
on the drawing board. I found that work fascinating. I ended up on one of the 
larger projects through that work.
Through these assignments, my career moved from science to project man-
agement. It was partly a result of my interests but also the priorities of the 
Air Force.
Harpham: What was that transition like from a professional identity as a 
scientist to this new role?
Gadeken: I thought it was going to be very difficult. It turned out differently. 
Back in the 1970s, there were few courses available in project management. 
After I was in the field for about eight years, I got to attend the project man-
agement course at the Defense Systems Management College [DSMC]. The 
organization was set up by David Packard, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, 
when he became the Deputy Secretary of Defense in the 1970s.
He observed that the military was pulling people from active military service 
and putting them into project management without much training. It didn’t 
make a lot of sense to pull people in that way.

Project Managers at Work
67
As I started my study of project management at DSMC, I gained a much broader 
perspective. I learned how projects were funded, how they were managed 
and the typical issues and complexities that occur. I thought to myself, “This 
is really fascinating!” I realized that I would enjoy teaching project managers 
even more.
At the ten-year point in my career, I made the switch from practicing project 
management to developing project managers.
Harpham: How did that switch come about?
Gadeken: From ROTC, I had a service commitment to serve four years 
in the military. After the Vietnam War ended, there was big reduction in all 
the military services. The colonel I was working for at the time said to me, 
“Look, you have a good background but promotion opportunities are going to 
shrink because there are cutbacks. I advise you to get out and pursue a civilian 
career.” I took his advice.
One of things I learned is that if you’re working with people you trust, ask 
them for advice, and listen to what they have to say. It was excellent advice 
for me. I watched some of my friends get stuck in dead-end positions in the 
military where they couldn’t get promoted due to the cutbacks.
At this point, I transitioned to a civilian career working for the Air Force. Later, 
I moved to a teaching role at DSMC, which eventually grew to become the 
Defense Acquisition University.
Harpham: For a civilian reader who is unfamiliar with the military context, 
what are some of the unique challenges involved in military projects?
Gadeken: It’s a very large system. The U.S. Department of Defense spends 
a significant amount of taxpayers’ dollars on projects and related activities. 
That includes maintaining bases, training, developing equipment, and managing 
highly complex projects. At the same time, we’re in a dynamic environment 
where there are threats to U.S. national security from major powers and ter-
rorists. To respond to that environment, we develop plans to respond and 
regularly revise those plans in light of new information.
Finally, our whole budget process is governed by the U.S. Congress. The 
Congress is made up of representatives from across the country. That body 
has a lot of competing demands on it for how federal dollars are spent. In 
many cases, demands in Congress are dynamic and change based on the politi-
cal situation. For example, which party is in power and which people are 
on certain committees has a tremendous impact on the military budget. If a 
certain district has a military base or defense supplier in that area, that factor 
impacts Congressional actions and projects relating to defense spending.
The funding for our projects is on a roller coaster. It goes up and down. That 
makes it much more difficult for project managers to lay out and execute a 
project plan.

Chapter 6 | Owen C. Gadeken, Professor, Defense Acquisition University
68
Harpham: When it comes to mega projects like a stealth bomber or an 
­aircraft carrier, these projects take a long time to build and put into the field. 
At the same, there is a roller coaster effect. Do you have to hit the pause 
­button on these projects?
Gadeken: Sometimes the pause button is hit by other stakeholders. One 
pause button is a decision from Congress to cut the funding for your ­project. 
There have been a number of instances where the project is going along 
­successfully. Then Congress makes a decision to change the funding, so you’re 
stuck on hold.
In other situations, you’re trying to do something very ambitious. It could be 
you’re developing new technology or pushing the limits of the system. You 
begin to test the system and you have a few failures. In that case, you have a 
problem because you will not meet your schedule or plan when you hit unex-
pected developments. When you push the frontier of technology, systems, 
and processes to do something innovative, it is challenging to meet a schedule.
When you’re in a large organization like the Department of Defense, we have 
a lot of organizations that affect project management as stakeholders. They 
are outside of the formal control of the project managers. So, project manag-
ers have to constantly cultivate a consensus to keep their projects moving 
forward. We have separate organizations that do budgets and contract sup-
port. Today, we’re not in the business of building anything directly—we’re in 
the business of contracting for systems.
There’s a real challenge to build a consensus and influence people because 
there are so many different groups.
Harpham: Is there conflict or tension between the traditional military ver-
sus civilian project managers?
Gadeken: When I first started in project management, the traditional 
approach to selecting project managers was to pick an experienced opera-
tional person, such as an ace pilot or a ship captain. Then the leadership 
would say, “Hey, you’re a great pilot. You’re now a project manager for the 
next airplane.” Unfortunately, the project manager job is completely differ-
ent from the pilot job. As a result, many people struggled with these new 
assignments.
We have a lot of people that have great technical background and experience. 
The fact that you are a super engineer doesn’t necessarily mean you will be a 
super project manager. Project management is more than engineering. Project 
management is working with a cross-functional team and outside stakehold-
ers. That super engineer may have a penchant for wanting to have everything 
be cut and dried while project managers live in a much more chaotic environ-
ment. Not everyone makes that transition well.

Project Managers at Work
69
Harpham: They are used to saying, “Here are the specs, let’s start building.”
Gadeken: Right. Or if you’re a military commander, “Here’s pork chop hill. 
Follow me! We’re going to take that hill!” Unfortunately, that approach doesn’t 
work when the stakeholders don’t work for you. Instead of ordering people 
to do work, you have to influence them. That requires a different set of people 
skills.
In the project management field, there isn’t a straightforward hierarchical 
structure. There are people from across the country on the project—con-
tractors, units in the Pentagon, and so forth. They’re all stakeholders and you 
do not have direct power over them. First of all, you have to know who those 
stakeholders are. Second, you have to make contact, get to know them, figure 
out what their interests are, and then build consensus.
Harpham: I imagine that even if you are based in Washington, DC, you will 
still have to collaborate with people in bases and organizations across the 
country.
Gadeken: Certainly. In fact, there are a large number of stakeholders across 
the world. We may award a contract to a company in the United States. 
However, that company may have vendors and suppliers from across the 
world. Pulling all of that together is a challenge. There’s also a security issue. 
How reliable is that electronic component we got from some country in the 
Pacific Rim? How are we going to verify that the component is not a counter-
feit and that it has high reliability?
Harpham: As an educator, how do you approach teaching and developing 
these relationship development skills in your students?
Gadeken: When I started at DAU, we literally taught project management. 
We taught every discipline and we put different subject matter experts in 
front of the class for lectures. We figured that the more knowledge we could 
pump into someone, the better project manager they would be.
Over time, we realized that is a flawed concept for two reasons. First, there 
are far more efficient ways of transmitting technical knowledge that don’t 
require people to be sitting in a classroom. That led us to a blended learn-
ing approach—basic knowledge is covered through online learning pro-
grams, which must be completed before you attend the advanced program in 
residence.
Second, project management knowledge doesn’t guarantee success. They have 
to be able to perform in this environment where you’re dealing with people. 
As you move up through our training program, there is a growing emphasis on 
people skills: building a team, leading a team, being able to negotiate, and deal 
with conflict. Those skills are just as important as all the knowledge you have. 
If you can’t apply your knowledge in a changing environment with different 
stakeholders, you will not be successful.

Chapter 6 | Owen C. Gadeken, Professor, Defense Acquisition University
70
Harpham: What is your approach to teaching conflict management skills?
Gadeken: We like to use assessments. We use the Myers-Briggs personality 
type indicator along with an instrument to assess emotional intelligence. We 
do 360-degree feedback where new students are rated by their boss, peers, 
and direct reports. They will get a composite picture of how they look as a 
manager and leader to the people they work with. With that information, they 
will understand their strengths and weaknesses and decide where to improve.
In my early days on the faculty, I convinced my organization to do a study on 
the characteristics of top performing project managers in our business. We 
needed to find out what successful project managers are doing and then use 
that information as a basis for our future training. While the military changes 
in some ways—new departments, new names, and so forth—I would argue 
that the fundamental military project management culture has not changed 
and therefore the study still has merit.
We had a group of project managers from each service—Army, Navy, Air 
Force. They were hand-picked for the study and we interviewed them in 
depth. We asked them to go through some of the difficult situations they 
faced. We then dissected what they were doing as the project manager. We 
divided the sample into highly capable project managers and top performers. 
Almost all the difference between the two groups came down to the soft 
skills.
Soft skills such as relationship development and political awareness  
[i.e., understanding peoples’ interests] came up as key points. Everyone thought 
we would get different findings, such as engineering or financial knowledge, but 
that did not come up in this research. It was fascinating to see that soft skills 
made a tremendous difference.
Harpham: What does political awareness mean for project managers? What 
would I notice about someone who has high political awareness?
Gadeken: I think you would notice that they pay attention to how deci-
sions are made in organizations. They pay attention to who seems to be the 
thought leader in each functional area—the people that carry the most sway 
when a decision needs to be made or those who are sought out for advice. 
All organizations have a formal power structure that you can look at—the 
classic organization chart. It shows job titles—who is at the director level and 
so forth. That’s only part of the picture.
However, organizations all have an informal structure. That includes who 
speaks to who? Who has known each other for years? Who knows how to get 
an activity approved quickly when you are racing against a deadline and have 
to cut corners? When you have political awareness, you have the ability to get 
work done with the least amount of effort and the least amount of resistance.

Project Managers at Work
71
This is a learned skill. People can learn this skill if they realize it’s important 
and see that you can get results. For example, if you notice that the command-
er’s executive assistant influences whether or not you can get an appointment 
to speak with that person. With that knowledge, you can work on connecting 
with the executive assistant. The assistant may also give informal advice to 
the commander. Therefore, if you can convince the assistant, there’s a higher 
likelihood they will share that view with the decision maker.
However, I have seen a challenge. If you bring in people with a military engi-
neering background, that type of person tends not to have political awareness. 
People select that career path because they like the technical challenge or 
they like the fact that there is always a right answer. Those people tend to be 
the most difficult to train to be politically sensitive.
At the start of our programs, we have to convince students that soft skills 
are important. If we do that, we can start the process. If we went directly to 
case studies, some students will say, “Hmm, I don’t see why these soft skills 
are important.”
Harpham: If we take the classical engineer who says “Give me the spec sheet 
and we’ll get it done. Why can’t I just get going? The general already signed off 
on this.” How do you broaden their perspective?
Gadeken: When I first came here, we mainly offered traditional lecture style 
teaching. Thankfully, we have moved to a different model that has some lec-
ture instruction mixed in with other approaches. Today, our methods empha-
size case studies and team exercises with hands-on work.
With a case study, we are reading about a real project from the Department 
of Defense. It’s not a case of simply doing a calculation and coming up with the 
right answer. The political issues are mixed in with the technical design issues. 
Funding and pressures from Capitol Hill are part of the picture as well. In the 
real world, all of those issues are in force.
We then ask students, “How would you handle that?” We use a dilemma 
approach—we take the project up to a specific problem on the project. We 
then say, “OK, project managers, what would you do here?”
Harpham: What would be examples of these dilemma points that threaten 
project success in these case studies?
Gadeken: You’re working on a big system project that will take several years 
like a ship or a tracked vehicle. During the course of development, you dis-
cover that the threat has changed. Our adversaries now have different systems 
or weapons—they now have more advanced systems. That means what we’re 
building will no longer work. So, what do you do? Can you modify the system 
you are building? Do you start all over and build something completely new?
Another example: you’re moving along on a project and you’re doing a good job. 
Then, suddenly Congress decides to set your budget to zero for a year or two.  

Chapter 6 | Owen C. Gadeken, Professor, Defense Acquisition University
72
In other words, you’re not going to get any more money. Now, we have some 
overhead funds that allow us to keep the government project team going. But 
if we have people out in industry building something for us, they can’t keep 
their project team going without additional funding—they’re likely to shut 
down the project. Then a year or two later, Congress allocates further budget 
and your industry project team isn’t there anymore. And now you have to 
start over with the project to a degree. So, the dilemma would be how to 
restart the project effectively? These are all real scenarios that have happened 
on Defense projects.
Harpham: How does the classroom discussion unfold on these case studies?
Gadeken: We hope for out of the box ideas in the discussion. Even our 
senior decision makers are looking for people who will be innovative in their 
approach to solving problems.
Unfortunately, the cultural history of the Defense Department has an impact. 
The culture tends to look for certainty. It’s a challenge to take someone who 
has marched along in a somewhat predictable career path and teach the old 
dog new tricks. Some people adapt to it better than others.
Harpham: How did you develop this approach to teaching project 
management?
Gadeken: We looked around for best practices. For example, we went to the 
Harvard Business School and the [Ivey] business school at Western University 
in Canada where they have long-standing experience in using case studies. 
Our cases, for the most part, are real government projects. Lately, we have 
started to ask students to create their own case studies at the end of their 
program based on their experience. Some of those cases are included in 
future sessions of the course. That means we also have fresh material and 
examples in the course.
Harpham: How do you think about lessons learned and using them to 
improve performance?
Gadeken: That’s a pet peeve of mine. For the entire time I’ve been here, we’ve 
had a periodic desire to try to catalog lessons learned by looking at failed or 
problematic projects. We then try to derive what went wrong on a given project.
A few observations on the lessons learned process. For some reason, it seems 
like the project management community has never been that interested in 
looking at this material. More significant to me, lessons learned need to be 
understood in the in the context of that project.
When you think there is a lesson learned on one project—“I always want 
to use this type of contract or technical approach”—that may be exactly the 
wrong thing to do on another project because the circumstances are quite 
different. You have to be careful with what you think of as a lesson learned.

There are so many varieties of projects and circumstances that it is difficult to 
develop general rules.
Harpham: There’s a significant challenge in deriving meaningful general prin-
ciples from lessons learned.
Gadeken: There are principles but it is fairly difficult to generalize across all 
projects. We have an amazing diversity of projects here. I have people in my 
class who are working on a new submarine, a new unmanned ground vehicle, 
clothing for soldiers, and a new satellite. We have people in the Army medical 
command who are working on new drugs to combat diseases.
Harpham: Turning to project management methodology. How do you nego-
tiate the fact that the statute book may say “do X” or the regulation says “do 
Y” but the big contractor wants to do it a different way? How do you recon-
cile these differences?
Gadeken: That’s a dilemma. Due to the large bureaucracy in the Defense 
Department, if you were to actually follow every one of the guidelines, rules 
and regulations, we might never put anything in the field for war fighters. In 
some cases, the war fighters not only need new systems but sometimes they 
need something put into the field rapidly.
Here’s what we tell our project managers. Let’s get to the heart of the mat-
ter—what is the true need? Then look for people that you can work with in 
these other organizations who can tell you about the flexibility in the policies 
and procedures. Then you can put in a request to waive certain requirements 
to get the project done.
We have two systems for project management in fact. The traditional disci-
plined process includes the full set of milestone reviews, detailed plans and so 
forth. We also have a rapid acquisition group who can go out, buy something, 
make some quick modifications, and send it out.
Remember Daniel Kahneman’s book, Thinking, Fast and Slow [Farrar, Straus and 
Giroux, 2011], where he describes System 1 and System 2 thinking processes? 
One system is fast but prone to errors. The other thinking process is slower, 
takes energy, and produces fewer errors. Our project approaches are similar 
to this model.
Our traditional approach employs critical thinking and the full set of pro-
cesses. However, there are also times where there is an urgent need and we 
have to move quickly and accept the risks associated with that approach.
Harpham: Is there a tension between these contrasting approaches to 
projects?
Gadeken: Some of our operational organizations would say, “Wow, we got 
that piece of equipment into the field fast. I want to migrate more of my 
­projects to this rapid capability process.”

Chapter 6 | Owen C. Gadeken, Professor, Defense Acquisition University
74
However, there are downsides to the rapid process. If I buy something from 
a vendor quickly, what’s the reliability of that system? What’s my long-term 
maintenance and support plan for the equipment? We address all of those 
points using the traditional approach. When we go fast, we skip those steps. 
That means you will have trade-offs in terms of maintenance, reliability, cost, 
and risks.
Harpham: I can imagine if you’re the requestor all you say is that “I requested 
this item and two weeks later, it’s here. Why can’t I do that all the time?”
Gadeken: It’s hard to do complex projects that fast unless you’re willing to 
embrace a higher likelihood of waste and problems regarding sustaining that 
equipment over time. There’s also public scrutiny of our projects when we 
have test failures and other issues with our projects. There’s a desire to avoid 
that criticism by using a robust process—the trade-off is that it takes longer 
to execute.
Harpham: There’s a tension between the short term and the long term. The 
idea is “we can ship this to you fast but don’t be surprised if it breaks down 
next year.”
Gadeken: The trade-off is exactly that. You asked for this equipment urgently 
and we got it there fast. However, you will lose the long-term benefits to a 
large degree when a rapid process is used.
Harpham: I gather that the DAU organization periodically accepts students 
from outside the US military, such as those from other federal agencies. How 
does that work?
Gadeken: We have a small budget to accommodate people from outside of 
the Defense Department. Our courses are very popular! One audience we 
appeal to is the defense industry. We would like to have more defense indus-
try students in our courses because we have a lot of work going on with them.
The industry perspective adds to the approach. In our current class of fifty-
six students, we have two students from major defense contractors. We also 
offer seats to other government agencies, such as NASA and the Department 
of Energy. We like the diversity in our classes. Within the defense world, we 
have diversity from civilian and military people.
Harpham: What do students from outside the defense world bring to the 
class in terms of project wisdom or questions?
Gadeken: There are some underlying project management principles that 
apply to all organizations. The value we get from non-defense students is that 
they have often tried approaches that we have not tried. It’s a fresh set of ideas 
and examples. They may suggest different solutions when we look at a case 
study that nobody in the Defense world would suggest.

Harpham: Mandatory training in organizations can be a tough sell. Do you 
have the challenge of students saying, “I just want to go build submarines, but 
my commanding officer made me come here. Let’s get this over with.” How 
do you engage students coming into the program?
Gadeken: We have had difficulties like that when we started the program. 
The Navy didn’t want to send people to the program because they wanted to 
put their people on projects immediately. Over time, we won them over by 
showing how we added value to their people when they take our training first.
Unlike other organizations, the project management career path in our orga-
nization is written into federal legislation. That means that people must come 
to our class—we don’t have a demand problem when it comes to training! 
However, I’m concerned about having students with the right attitude—that 
they’re here to learn how to be a successful project manager versus someone 
who is just looking for a diploma at the end.
I engage students by saying, “Here’s what we can do together.” Next, students 
go through a variety of assessment processes. We’re not giving grades like A, 
B, or C but we are assessing people. Students go through an exercise and they 
get feedback that may convince them that they are not fully proficient in the 
project management field. Honest assessment goes a long way as a motiva-
tional tool.
Harpham: Would you say this willingness to change and self-awareness is 
part of your leadership philosophy?
Gadeken: Definitely. You need someone who is humble and candid enough to 
recognize their own shortcomings. Even high-potential people rising through 
the ranks realize that they need to embrace continuous learning. They need 
to keep learning to be effective and to benefit the people they are leading.
We’ve started to change our philosophy from training project managers to 
creating project leaders. Just the phrase “project manager” suggests that 
you’re a glorified technical manager. If you don’t have that leadership dimen-
sion, you’re missing important skills to be successful in this field.
Harpham: What is your approach to personal productivity and organization?
Gadeken: This type of job can be very demanding. Project management is 
also highly dynamic and full of change. A challenge for me is that it has been 
many years since I rolled up my sleeves and worked on a technical project 
after I switched my career into training and development.
Therefore, I have to work to keep up in the field. When I moved into civilian 
life, I stayed in the Air Force reserves for a time. When I put my uniform on, 
I’d go to work on a base and work on Air Force projects.

Chapter 6 | Owen C. Gadeken, Professor, Defense Acquisition University
76
When I retired from the reserves, that option was no longer available to me. 
My field is now project management/leadership education. I feel that I must 
keep current therefore I go to as much training and as many professional 
conferences as I can.
Our requirement is that I do forty hours of professional development per 
year. I usually far exceed that requirement. I go to professional associations, 
seminars and push myself to keep learning. Given that I’m training high-poten-
tial people, I tell myself that I have to be the most highly trained person in the 
room to keep up with the students.
Harpham: It sounds like lifelong learning is both a key strategy and a passion 
for you.
Gadeken: That’s why I like my role. I’m helping to train our future proj-
ect managers and I’m benefiting from that work. I’m learning as much as my 
students.
Harpham: What are some of the books that had a significant impact on your 
thinking and work?
Gadeken: At a recent conference I attended, I heard Simon Sinek speak. He 
has some great books like Start with Why [Portfolio, 2011] and Leaders Eat Last 
[Portfolio, 2014]. I enjoyed hearing him speak. His books are great.
I’ve always liked Good to Great by Jim Collins [HarperBusiness, 2001]. I really 
like his concept of a Level 5 leader. We have a mythology about leadership 
that claims that leaders are always charismatic and that you’re excellent at 
public speaking. Those are nice to have but they’re not required attributes.
My focus right now is studying leadership because our organization has many 
subject matter experts on other aspects of project management. I need to 
understand and keep learning about leadership. I believe that a lot of leader-
ship can be learned from studying good leaders in a variety of contexts: busi-
ness, military, and even sports and politics.
I’ve always been a student of history and that interest translates to leadership. 
For example, I study the American Civil War and the leaders involved in that 
conflict. How did they handle their opponent if they were outnumbered or 
outmaneuvered? I’ve actually written an article about project management 
lessons from the Battle of Gettysburg. I have a class exercise that was directly 
inspired by the Civil War.
I like to read biographies of leaders and see what leadership insights I can 
glean from those.
Harpham: I see where you’re coming from. I’ve benefited from studying Ron 
Chernow’s biographies of John D. Rockefeller and George Washington.

Gadeken: Once upon a time, I thought Abraham Lincoln was lucky and that 
he had outstanding people working for him. When you study the details, you 
find out his reality was quite different. It just looks like that on the surface 
because Lincoln was so good at leading different people. Lincoln’s leadership 
achievements are explained in excellent detail in Doris Goodwin’s Team of 
Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln [Simon & Schuster, 2005]. He actu-
ally put his rivals in his Cabinet and they became his advisors. At the end, it 
looks smooth but it was not like that while it was happening.
Harpham: Lincoln’s example shows the value of leaders surrounding them-
selves with strong people who voice different opinions.
Gadeken: In fact, you need different perspectives around you. You want 
people who will tell the truth, even when it’s painful to hear.
Harpham: Any closing thoughts on project management that we haven’t 
covered?
Gadeken: If I look at what I’m doing now, I never could have predicted my 
career path. I was lucky enough to have my career evolve rather than plan 
it out. If I planned it out, I would likely be in a research lab and potentially, 
I wouldn’t be as happy. I’m glad how things worked out. I made incremental 
decisions to guide my career according to my intuition.
At one point, a senior person in the Pentagon asked me to come and work for 
him. In the traditional career path, that would have been a wonderful opportu-
nity—to become a senior executive in the Pentagon. At the time, I took a few 
days to think about it. I realized that the opportunity didn’t meet my definition 
of success even though that’s what the system encouraged.
My definition of success was to be where I could influence people to become 
better leaders. That’s exactly what I’m doing in my current role. Following my 
own definition of success has been important.

Shobha 
Subramonian
Principal Project Manager, SAS
Shobha Subramonian is a principal project manager at SAS in Cary, North 
Carolina. She is currently the R&D program lead for the SAS Customer Intelligence 
360 program, which develops and builds Software-as-a-Service [SaaS] products. She 
started her career as a developer at the Dow Chemical Co. in 1993. Later, she joined 
Accenture and continued as a software developer in SAP applications. She obtained 
the PMP certification in 2006. Afterward, she progressed through project manage-
ment roles at three different companies, working on and leading various software 
development projects. Prior to her current role at SAS, she led a project to install 
Workday to replace the organization’s existing HR and payroll systems.
Subramonian holds a master’s degree in computer science from Central Michigan 
University. She is married with two adult children and lives with her husband in Cary, 
North Carolina.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
Shobha Subramonian: Several years ago, I was working at a Big Six consult-
ing firm. In that organization, I worked as an application specialist—a combina-
tion of a software analyst and a business analyst role—working on SAP supply 
chain systems. I expressed an interest in leadership to my managers. I wanted 
to lead the work of the team.

We had project managers in the company who led large projects. There was 
a smaller project that came up that presented an opportunity. There were 
no project managers at the company available to lead some of the smaller 
projects. Management asked me if I would like to lead the effort. I was happy 
to get involved.
I was working on the project’s tasks and leading it. It was a small team of about 
six people. It gave me the opportunity to create a plan, work the plan, and so 
forth. I covered planning, requirements, design, implementation, and execution 
of the project. It was a good introduction to project management.
This was in the days when project management was not fully recognized as 
a distinct role in the way it is today. Sometimes managers led the projects. 
Sometimes lead developers led the projects. This presented a perfect oppor-
tunity for me. I discovered that I was good at project management and that  
I enjoyed this kind of work.
Harpham: What was the objective of the project?
Subramonian: To implement enhancements to an in-house customer  
complaints ­management system. For this project, we ­gathered requirements 
from our internal users. We had to convert those requirements into a design, 
test the features, and implement the enhancements.
Harpham: You had this desire to take on leadership responsibility. Did the 
project satisfy what you were looking for?
Subramonian: Yes, it did. On the project, I learned that I had to take the 
­different personalities on the project into account. That was a new ­challenge 
for me. I had to account for different strengths and weaknesses on the ­project 
team and put that insight into action. I had learned some leadership and 
project methods from observing and working with other project managers. 
However, I learned that there was much more involved to make a project 
­successful than organization.
Beyond organizational skills, it is vital to bring a team together and understand 
the talents of the different people. It was a very good experience. There was 
a little bit of a balancing act because I wasn’t really a leader in a traditional 
sense—I did not formally have that role. I had to be careful not to step on 
anyone’s toes.
Harpham: What methods did you use to inspire the team to work together 
effectively?
Subramonian: Today, I use the agile methodology, which has practices such as 
daily Scrum meetings, planning meetings, etc. that automatically and regularly 
bring the team together and helps the team build closer working relationships.

Project Managers at Work
81
In earlier days, with waterfall project management, these kinds of team 
­interactions were not inherent with the project methodology. I think it is 
important to bring the team together to build these connections. We had an 
open office layout, we had lunch together, and we interacted outside of the 
project itself. That helps to build relationships with the people you’re working 
with. Having those connections makes the project more successful and easier 
to manage. Take the time to get to know each person and have conversations 
with them about their life outside of work, such as their families or hobbies. 
Connecting on a personal level makes you more approachable. As people get 
to know each other better, they definitely work better together.
Harpham: Currently, you’re involved in research and development projects. 
You’re creating something new and exciting. Walk me through what’s it like to 
do R&D projects in your current role.
Subramonian: It presents an interesting set of challenges compared to ear-
lier projects I worked on. In the past, I had a framework to go by. In contrast, 
I’m developing the project and framework to run it at the same time in R&D.
There are no standards or guidelines to use because the product we’re devel-
oping is so new. The environment and the platform are also new. We have to 
define the rules and the standards. It’s exciting and challenging. It can also be 
pretty daunting at times. When you get the project done, it becomes a model 
for others in the company to follow.
There are a lot of smart people in R&D, which makes a big difference as we try 
to navigate this new ground. However, there’s a lot of trial and error to make 
it work. Once we get it to work, it’s a very satisfying experience.
Harpham: What is a recently completed R&D project you’ve worked on?
Subramonian: We recently created a cloud-based, multi-tenant digital 
­marketing product called SAS Customer Intelligence 360. This is something 
new for our company. We’re also using a continuous release process for 
this product. Up until now, our product releases have been developed over 
months or years and then we roll out a new version. With this new product, 
we have customers using the product and we roll out new software versions 
to them each month.
This is drastically different from projects that we’ve done before. We had to 
think of a model that would fit the different stages of the development cycle 
and still meet a monthly delivery schedule. Our team had to delve into how to 
deploy this on the cloud, and configure different tenants as per the customer 
requirements. We drew expertise from people we hired who had worked on 
similar technologies at other companies. Self-education was a key factor with 
this project. Our team members went to workshops and training sessions, and 
worked with AWS [Amazon Web Services] consultants to figure out how to 
use these services.

Chapter 7 | Shobha Subramonian, Principal Project Manager, SAS
82
Our first release of the software, which was an early adopter release  
[pre-production or trial software] in June 2015, was very challenging. Getting 
into the cadence of a monthly release was the next step—that took a while to 
perfect. I developed a process model where development, testing and related 
activities are now on a rhythm where we can release monthly.
Harpham: What exactly does this marketing product do for the customer?
Subramonian: It’s a digital marketing product based on customer ­intelligence. 
The product user [such as a retail store] would use it to gather data from 
their customers on the Web. Based on this data, the user decides what to 
market to their customers. The product runs analytics on shopping behavior 
and other customer activities. Based on that analysis, the marketer is able to 
come up with campaigns to market more effectively to its customers.
Harpham: How did you move to the monthly project cadence? Did it mean 
compressing activities or doing them differently?
Subramonian: We had to take on a completely new mindset. I had to man-
age the scope differently—adopt a much smaller scope. Our previous projects 
had a scope appropriate for a one-year duration. With a monthly release, a 
smaller scope was needed. A key question became “What can we do within 
the month?” For example, adding the ability to create mobile in-app messages 
to send to mobile app users, or enhancing email messages by adding images 
or backgrounds. It’s a very small slice of what you would normally do on a 
project.
Today, we have a shippable product every month. Previously, we might have 
completed development activities in our monthly sprints. Theoretically, we 
were planning to have a shippable product at the end of each sprint. But in 
practice, that was not the case, since much more is required to have a ship-
pable product than to just complete development. However, today we are 
actually releasing the product each month. Learning this new approach to 
scope management was key. It took a while to develop this approach. Cutting 
scope down enough in order to be able to deliver monthly was something 
we learned how to do. The first few efforts to adapt to the monthly cycle 
were so ambitious that we went two or three months between releases. We 
planned features that were too large to complete in one sprint. We learned 
to break these features into smaller components and to get better at manag-
ing the scope.
We also had to learn about the cloud technology and how to push out new 
upgrades. Our team worked closely with customers to make sure the ­software 
was meeting their requirements. When it didn’t meet their requirements, we 
took in that feedback to make changes.

Harpham: How do you measure success in this environment? For example, 
how do you know if the July release was better than the March release or 
vice versa?
Subramonian: Success for us is primarily customer satisfaction. We roll 
out our software and customers are using the early version. Our measure of 
success is: “Does the product meet customer expectations?” Also, we look at 
how many defects are found in the product. The initial challenge was to actu-
ally be able to deliver the product on a monthly release schedule.
The next challenge is to make our software fulfill customer expectations in 
every respect. That includes delivering new functionality with high quality and 
reducing defects. At this point, we’re still early in the game. Every release 
is better than the previous one in terms of meeting the release date and 
responding to customer questions quickly.
Harpham: Let’s explore customer satisfaction. In large organizations, project 
managers are sometimes several steps removed from the end customer. That 
distance makes it difficult to understand the end customer. What are some of 
your methods to understand the end customer?
Subramonian: In our organization, we have a close tie with the operations 
team and the technical support team, and the product management team. We 
work closely with those teams, which helps us to understand customer feed-
back even if we are not in direct conversation with customers on a daily basis.
From time to time, R&D managers and directors go out and visit the ­customer 
in person. They engage with them in workshops and seek out their feedback. 
That is all brought back and shared with the project team in great detail. That 
helps us decide our focus for the next several releases.
Harpham: Earlier, you mentioned the importance of professional develop-
ment in doing R&D products. Could you share some examples of professional 
development activities that have made a big difference to your career?
Subramonian: I have attended various information sessions about the prod-
uct. I also went to workshops on cloud products to understand how they are 
managed and developed. That was beneficial for me to understand how cloud-
based software works. Other people in the team had more in depth training 
on the technology, processes, and tools.
The more informed you are about the product, the better it is for the project 
manager. It makes you into a more effective project manager. It’s true that we 
can apply our project management methods regardless of the software. That 
said, it’s more effective when you know the product and the technology. It 
means you are able to speak the same language as the team.

Chapter 7 | Shobha Subramonian, Principal Project Manager, SAS
84
Harpham: How have you decided how much technical depth and knowledge 
to acquire as a project manager?
Subramonian: I started my career as a developer and worked in SAP soft-
ware for several years before going into project management. I worked on 
projects related to sales and distribution, quality management, finance, materi-
als management, etc. As I worked on different projects, I tried to gain a good 
understanding of the functional aspects of the software I was building.
The fact that I have a development background definitely helps me. The fact 
that I’m not fully conversant with the latest technology may present some 
challenges. However, you have a technical lead and developers on the project 
who have that expertise. They’re happy to share information so that you can 
understand the big picture. If you have a good relationship with your technical 
team members, it’s easy to have a conversation to gain that understanding.
I also think it’s valuable to take training sessions to get an overview of the 
product. I aim to attend training sessions put on for developers from time to 
time.
Harpham: What are some lessons and insights you’ve learned from mentors 
over your career?
Subramonian: Sometimes I think a project is on track and going well. Then, 
there’s a sudden surprise problem that I didn’t anticipate. Communication is 
the most important activity in project management. It’s key to reach all of the 
people who could influence your project and take it in a different direction 
or derail it.
Thinking back to my earlier projects, I remember getting close to the end 
on one of them and then something came up. Someone on the customer 
side raised an objection on a particular change. At first glance, the objection 
seemed trivial. I never would have thought that this would derail the project 
but it did! You cannot overlook or discount even small risks or small stake-
holders without consequences.
I learned to put my finger on those situations. For example, keeping more peo-
ple “in the know” and making sure they are fully backing the project. People 
don’t like surprises! If somebody reaches out to you and says, “Hey, I didn’t 
know this project was happening,” you need to manage that.
Harpham: Let’s look at the stakeholder management aspect further. Can 
you share more about the situation where a stakeholder raised a red flag and 
caused challenges for the project?
Subramonian: I remember working on a project for the SAP quality manage-
ment system. The client had a few people involved on the project who defined 
the requirements, and we worked through the design, testing, and implemen-
tation. There was one requirement where we noted an exception—that we 

Project Managers at Work
85
would not be able to deliver a feature because it had high cost and low value. 
This exception had buy-in from most people on the client side including the 
supply chain specialist who was the primary client, and the project sponsor.
However, there was one person—a material flow specialist, from whom we 
didn’t get buy in for the exception. She didn’t say much early in the project. 
As the project kept going, I made the assumption that the issue had been 
addressed and closed. That was not the case. It became evident during signoff 
that what we thought was a small issue was unacceptable to the client. We 
had to stop the project and put in an enhancement.
Just because the client didn’t say, “Hey stop, I don’t agree,” is not enough—it’s 
necessary for us to proactively get their explicit agreement. We needed to 
go back and do the due diligence on the issue. We didn’t hear from them and 
assumed everything was fine. That was not the case.
Harpham: That could be a project management principle: “Avoid assuming 
stakeholder silence means there are no problems or risks on the project.”
Subramonian: In our minds, we thought it was a trivial issue, so we didn’t pay 
much attention to it. Obviously, this person had a different view. It’s important 
to get that explicit approval from all of the stakeholders. If the stakeholder 
has the ability to throw a wrench in the project, they need to be considered.
Harpham: What was your perspective on the stakeholder in this case?
Subramonian: I think the stakeholder had the view: “I haven’t been asked for 
my OK. But my lack of comment doesn’t mean I approve of the project.” They 
had an expectation that the requirement would be done.
Harpham: That illustrates how a disconnect with a stakeholder can become 
more pronounced over time. Let’s now turn to your approach to productivity. 
What does your personal productivity system and habits look like? A medical 
doctor who smokes would likely raise questions. Likewise, a disorganized proj-
ect manager may raise questions about their ability to organize and execute.
Subramonian: I use project plans and processes quite extensively. However, 
I aim to keep it simple for my teams—I believe very strongly in keeping orga-
nization simple and easy to manage.
I use the organizational tools available at work and the methodologies I have 
learned over time. Microsoft Project, Outlook, calendars, SharePoint, and JIRA 
[a product that provides issue tracking and project management functions] 
are some of the tools I use for communication, scheduling, planning, and track-
ing work with my teams.
In terms of books, The Magic of Thinking Big by David J. Schwartz [Touchstone, 
2015] had a big impact on me. One of the ideas that was really instilled in my 
mind from this book is that you can achieve things with the power of belief. 
That is, if you believe very strongly that you can do something then your mind

finds the ways for you to do it. This has been reinforced with me through 
my own experiences over the years, and it has enabled me to make signifi-
cant strides and changes successfully at key points in my career. I’ve also read  
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey [Simon & Schuster, 2013],  
which had a similar influence. It highlights how we shape our lives [either 
­consciously or unconsciously] by our choices—and the importance of being 
proactive.
Harpham: What role have mentors played in your career growth?
Subramonian: I have sought out mentorship by reaching out to ­successful 
people. A company that I previously worked at had a formal mentorship 
­program that I found helpful. Each employee was assigned a mentor with 
whom they would meet about once a quarter. This provided an avenue for 
employees to discuss all kinds of topics and issues with the mentor, some of 
which they may not want to discuss with their manager. In other companies,  
I looked for people who were good to learn from. Some people are more 
open to mentoring than others, so it takes a while to find the right people.
It’s also important to recognize that mentoring can be a very satisfying 
­experience for both people. It’s helpful to find people who are experienced in 
the company and who can train you on what works and what doesn’t in the 
­company. The culture of every company is different and that’s something you 
can learn from a mentor. Techniques that work in one company and setting 
may not transfer over to a new company.
From time to time, there are announcements and requests for people to join 
corporate projects or initiatives outside their usual sphere of responsibility. 
I like to sign up for some of these opportunities because it enables me to 
expand my connections and knowledge beyond my regular work. There are 
new perspectives and experiences to learn from these groups. It puts you in 
the position to handle different types of situations.
Last year, I was involved in a quality initiative with a team of people where we 
looked at various tools and reports to measure and track quality in R&D proj-
ects. We eventually added some of them to the project management toolkit. 
In a previous job while working as a software specialist, I got an opportunity 
to be involved in a communications project to support the rollout of a new 
HR system for the company. It was enlightening for me to see the detailed 
planning and organization that went into crafting the various communications 
to the different levels of management and employees of the company. This 
offered insights and understanding of subtle differences in messaging and also 
helped me to enhance my own communication skills.
Harpham: What is your approach to mentoring other people?
Subramonian: My approach is influenced by the fact I have benefited from 
mentors and learning from others. I look for opportunities to teach classes 

Project Managers at Work
87
from time to time. For example, if you learn a software tool before other 
people in the company, you have the opportunity to teach that tool to other 
people to help them become effective.
Harpham: In that case, you’re benefiting from being an early adopter?
Subramonian: Exactly. I’ve done this in a few different instances. For exam-
ple, I had prior experience with the JIRA tool from previous roles. Therefore, 
I could guide people in my current department on how to use it effectively. 
The more everyone knows about the processes and tools we use, the more 
productive they will become. I created a presentation on using JIRA and then 
shared it with other project managers in the company. I’m always open to 
teaching. Teaching helps me to connect with other people and it is always well 
worth the effort.
Harpham: For the reader who is interested in project management but cur-
rently works in a different field, how would you suggest they make a career 
move into project management?
Subramonian: Look for opportunities to lead a small group. If you do that, 
it will be a great experience. It will also help you discover whether you like 
leading people. I had the vision that I would like to lead a project. The first 
opportunity I had to lead confirmed my interest in leading. It was good to get 
that confirmation.
On the other hand, there have been people who have gone into project man-
agement and left the field. It might not be their cup of tea. It might be different 
from what they expect. You have to be “the glue” on the project bringing 
everyone together and make it work with different personalities. You also 
have to keep the project on track and meet deadlines.
Are you comfortable working toward deadlines and making the entire team 
work toward a deadline? These are key points to ask yourself when you look 
at a project management career. Are you happy to plan the work and organize 
the team? You may become the go-to person for people on the team who 
have a question. I enjoy doing all of that.
In contrast, if you enjoy being technical or taking direct control over the work, 
you may want a different role. The project manager often has to look to other 
people, such as the project sponsor, to make key decisions. You might not 
have as much power as a project manager as you might imagine.
Harpham: A tolerance for pressure and stress from deadlines and the 
­uncertainty of leading in the project environment comes with the job.
Subramonian: Absolutely, those are important qualities for success in 
­project management.

Harpham: Looking out over the next few years, what are some important 
trends that you see on the horizon in terms of technology or other trends?
Subramonian: The move to cloud-based technologies is likely to become 
more important. Rapid technological change requires us to be adaptable.  
I think it’s important to be open to change and keep up with changing needs. 
At one time, developing a product could take eighteen months. Now, you are 
developing a product for a set of customers and delivering it in a month.
I’m excited to work on our current product because it is new. I expect more 
projects to be like this in the future—coming up with new products using 
cutting-edge technology. I look forward to that.

Kristen Fleming
Vice President of Integrated Production, 
VaynerMedia
Kristen Fleming is vice president of integrated production at VaynerMedia, a 
­digital agency headquartered in New York City. She oversees and manages a team 
of ­integrated producers, whose work includes complex digital builds, event produc-
tion, video production, photo production, and emerging technology (i.e., virtual reality, 
Amazon bots, etc.). Fleming also supports VaynerMedia’s domestic and global sat-
ellite offices by leading trainings, implementing structures, and finding the right local 
market hires. Before leading integrated production, she helped build VaynerMedia’s 
project management team. In four years, Fleming grew the team from one person 
to 55 people. She led development of current training programs, project manage-
ment tools, and internal structures. She also performs improv around NYC and 
brings the art form’s “Yes, and…” mentality to all her work. Prior to VaynerMedia, 
Fleming was at another social media start-up, Big Fuel. She graduated from the 
College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
Kristen Fleming: I fell into project management. In college, I studied theater 
and English. After graduating from college, I moved to New York to pursue 
acting. After several years, I decided the acting lifestyle wasn’t for me anymore 
and decided to change direction. During this time, I was working as an intern 
at a public relations agency. Through an improv group I was in, a friend at a 
start-up social media agency noticed that I was highly organized and looking

for a career opportunity. She introduced me to people at the agency and I 
started there as a project coordinator.
In true start-up fashion, there was rapid change and surprises. A senior proj-
ect manager resigned within a month of me joining the company. As a result, 
I was assigned the responsibility of managing that person’s projects. It was a 
crash-course introduction to project management. I found that I was naturally 
good at project management and enjoyed doing it. I was also excited about 
social media—especially the dynamic and changing nature of the field.
Harpham: What was involved in this “crash course” experience with project 
management at the agency?
Fleming: It was a crazy experience. I had about two weeks’ notice that the 
person was going to leave and I had to take over. For example, I had to rapidly 
learn about all the tools and technology she was using on her projects. I was 
learning the basics of project management through the experience of working 
on a variety of projects—projects that ranged from producing social media 
content to more complex work [e.g., developing a global social architecture 
for a major electronics brand on Facebook]. I quickly learned what I could 
control and what my limitations were. By listening to the right team members 
and trusting their expertise, I gained a large breadth of project experience in 
a relatively short period of time.
Harpham: What was it like to rapidly transition from a project coordinator 
role to a project manager role?
Fleming: The biggest shift was moving from a reactive mindset to a proac-
tive leadership mindset. I took a step back from being in the weeds of project 
details and looking at the big picture. Specifically, I focused on the end goal of 
the project and led the project team to focus on that goal. It was a trial and 
error experience to learn the ropes quickly.
Harpham: What is a project management lesson that you’ve learned the 
hard way.
Fleming: The hardest lesson to learn is becoming less attached to the ­project 
plan. Instead, I’ve learned the value of providing flexibility for the project’s 
team. That may take the form of negotiating internal deadlines, pulling in a 
­different person to work on a task, or solving content production issues. 
Having the confidence to adjust the plan has been important.
I’ve struggled as a project manager in situations where I have been too rigid 
on the schedule. At the end of day, rigidly adhering to the plan for the plan’s 
sake doesn’t lead to success.
Harpham: What does flexibility from the plan look like in your context?
Fleming: Flexibility means being smart with the resources that you have. In 
addition, it’s important to give thought to the next important milestone on 

Project Managers at Work

the project and balance that against the project’s end goal. Let’s say you have 
two deliverables scheduled to run sequentially [e.g., complete A, then do B]. 
However, those deliverables may need to run in parallel given what the client 
is asking for.
Harpham: The principle is put the plan and tasks in service of the end goal. 
The details on how we get there is helpful, but it’s not carved in stone.
Fleming: It’s a producer mindset. The focus is on the work—always asking, 
“How do we get the work done in the best way possible?” Adopting that 
perspective has contributed to my success rather than focusing on myself or 
things outside of my control.
Harpham: What do you mean by the producer mindset?
Fleming: Project management can be highly task-focused—moving from A to B 
and checking off tasks. The best project managers are not just strong at the 
technical work [e.g., schedules and tasks]. In my field, great project managers 
understand the creative vision, the overall strategy, and the production capa-
bilities of different media. The ability to connect big picture issues, industry 
knowledge, and technical project management make up a star project manager.
Harpham: What is a project that you’re proud of achieving at VaynerMedia? 
What was the project’s objective and what was achieved?
Fleming: I’m proud of quite a few projects. One of my first big projects that 
I led was for Hasbro’s Monopoly game. In 2012 and 2013, we led a social 
media marketing project for Monopoly. It was the perfect combination of 
content, nostalgia, and new technology for that time.
Specifically, the campaign involved eliminating one of the game tokens and com-
ing up with a new one. We came up with the idea of producing a Facebook 
app where users could visit, see video content about the game tokens, vote 
on the one they wanted to “save” and vote on which game token they wanted 
to bring in. It was also VaynerMedia’s first Facebook app.
The campaign gathered tremendous buzz and attention. Conan O’Brien 
even made his own token—though not the most appropriate…. Fans also 
­developed grassroots campaigns to try to save certain game tokens from 
elimination. There was a hardware store that created a social content series 
to save the wheelbarrow game token. It was incredible to see the reaction 
and high engagement. Further, the app supported eight different languages, so 
there was global usage. The project’s success in terms of earned media and 
engagement was awesome for me to see.
From a stakeholder management standpoint, there were many points to 
­consider. I led collaboration with both internal and other creative agencies 
working on different aspects of the campaign.

VaynerMedia
92
Harpham: Was the earned media a project goal or a happy accident?
Fleming: I knew that we were going to get a lot of earned media from it 
because it’s an iconic board game. However, I was pleasantly surprised at just 
how much attention we got for it. It was exciting to see how many people 
were talking about it.
Harpham: Did everyone on the project team get a copy of the game?
Fleming: Yes! Everyone on the project team received a copy of Monopoly.  
I wanted to save the wheelbarrow game token and he made it through!
Harpham: The project reminds me of a reality TV show where the audience 
votes people off the show. Was that the concept?
Fleming: We used the concept of a “Monopoly jail” for the app. All the game 
tokens were stuck in jail and users had to break them out. Each token had 
animated videos showing how they would break out of jail. It was a lot of fun!
Harpham: Let’s turn to interaction with partner agencies and their role on 
different projects. Other agencies don’t report to you and yet you have to lead 
them. How do you manage that interaction?
Fleming: VaynerMedia is known for being a people first company. That means 
we treat all employees well and that spirit extends beyond the company. It is 
expected that I work to build strong professional relationships with all the 
partner agencies or vendors involved. Specifically, I aim to get to know each 
individual person at the agencies at a personal level. When you take a “people 
first” approach to the work, people tend to rally behind you and the work. 
Quality ultimately benefits.
Harpham: So you’ve managed to fight against the “resource 1 will do task X, 
resource 2 will do task Y” mentality that’s sometimes encouraged by project 
management software?
Fleming: There’s a lot of collaboration on projects. It’s far better to work 
with the team at an individual level rather than viewing them as anonymous 
resources.
Harpham: What does “people first” philosophy look like in your daily work?
Fleming: It starts with putting attention on the individual person. For exam-
ple, I look for subtleties in personality and preferences. I might have a creative 
professional on the project who knows how to prioritize and doesn’t want to 
be micro-managed. Alternately, you might have a person who cannot priori-
tize to save his or her life. In that case, the person needs constant attention to 
be successful. A high level of EQ [emotional intelligence] for the team you’re 
working with is important.
The ability to observe and adjust as a project manager also comes in helpful 
here. If I approach someone in one way and I observe that it doesn’t go well, 

Project Managers at Work
93
I’ll take a different approach next time. I tailor my approach depending on who 
I’m talking to.
Harpham: Experimentation is a big part of your approach to relating well to 
other people?
Fleming: Definitely.
Harpham: It sounds like the project manager has to be the person that takes 
the lead in being flexible in their communication style rather than demanding 
everyone saying, “Do it my way!”
Fleming: I have an idea on how we can get the project done. At the same 
time, I have experts in creative design, technical development, and other fields. 
Given that reality, I want to get their input so we can be successful. I don’t 
want to be a dictator on the project—that hurts the work and the team.
Harpham: What is your approach to leadership?
Fleming: My starting point is that I listen to everyone involved on the proj-
ect. Next, I try to understand where each person is coming from. As I have 
moved up at VaynerMedia, my success comes from listening and helping the 
people I work with. I also start from a place of trust. I think people in this 
industry have a tendency to overdramatize problems or get overly sensitive 
about disagreements. I take the view that we’re working toward the end goal 
of helping the client and let’s keep that in mind with regards to whatever our 
disagreements may be concerning process or methods. If you know what 
you’re doing, you need to trust your teammates to get their work done and 
trust their ideas.
Harpham: Listening is sometimes underappreciated as a skill. Let’s say you’re 
in a meeting with two other people: Jane is listening well to you and Robin 
is not. What are some of the differences that you observe in their behavior?
Fleming: My style is usually to defuse a situation with a joke or with humor. 
If someone is not listening to me, I’ll probably call attention to it in a joking 
way. If the lack of listening continues, I will ask about it directly: if you have 
somewhere else to be, please head out and we’ll catch up with you later. My 
assumption is always that a person’s behavior is not a personal insult to me. 
They probably have eight other concerns going through their mind. By taking 
that approach, people don’t feel attacked. Empathy is a tremendously impor-
tant part of effective listening and successful project management.
It’s unlikely that Robin would walk into the meeting thinking, “I’m going to 
show Kristen how much I disagree with her. I’m just not going to listen to her 
today.” Robin probably has a million other concerns on her plate right now. I’ll 
make a bid to get her to pay attention. But if that doesn’t work out, I’ll encour-
age her to step out of the meeting so she can attend to her other concerns.

Chapter 8 | Kristen Fleming, Vice President of Integrated Production, 
VaynerMedia
94
Harpham: It sounds both direct and polite—asking someone to leave a 
meeting if they are preoccupied with other matters.
Fleming: You want to be as respectful as possible especially when you’re 
responsible for creating the timeline, milestones and getting people to do the 
work. If you someone loses respect for you, it will make your job much more 
difficult.
Harpham: What is your approach to leading people from different ­disciplines? 
Many project managers started their careers as engineers or developers, and 
feel comfortable with those professionals. However, they may struggle to 
relate to and lead other professionals.
Fleming: It’s all in the approach you take. I’m not going to claim to be an 
expert in coding, for example. That said, I know the levels of effort and time 
required for certain kinds of coding tasks from experience. Even if it’s not 
my field of expertise, it’s important to understand enough to ask the right 
­questions. Listening skills also come into the picture again here. In some cases, 
I play a translation role between different teams, such as a technical specialist 
and the client account team. I ask good questions, repeat back what I hear to 
confirm that I have understood the information, and explain to the rest of the 
team why a given technical issue matters.
Harpham: What’s your approach to starting a new project in the first few 
days?
Fleming: I like to starting with auditing the brief—a summary document—
that describes what the project is all about. Next, I bring the key stakeholders 
together for a meeting to discuss the brief, answer questions, and clarify any 
ambiguous points in the brief. After that, I build out a project timeline and 
review that document with the stakeholders. Finally, I schedule the project 
kick off meeting.
In the kick off meeting, I cover a number of points. I start with roles and 
responsibilities—who will be performing certain kinds of work. I also cover 
the project schedule in the meeting.
Harpham: In some meetings, I see people ask, “Does anyone have ques-
tions?” And then wait a few seconds for a response and keep moving. In those 
cases, there could be questions or issues that people are not raising. How do 
you proactively engage people at this stage?
Fleming: I directly ask individual people in the meeting and ask for their 
feedback or agreement. Recently, I was in a project review meeting discussing 
scripts for a video. The director was in the meeting, however, he didn’t appear 
to be engaged. He may have been preoccupied about other video projects. 
Someone else asked the director if he had any questions and he said no.  
I wanted to err on the side of caution.

Project Managers at Work
95
In this case, I asked the director, “I want to triple check with you about these 
scripts and projects while we have you in the room. We want to make the 
best use of our time once we all arrive on the set for filming.” Specifically,  
I asked him whether there were any aspects of the project that might lead 
to unanticipated costs that had not been planned for. With those prompts, 
the director refocused and commented in greater depth about the project. In 
fact, he raised a concern relating to one part of the script. We then had the 
opportunity to work through that particular issue.
A good project manager needs to be listening to everyone and be able to react 
quickly. Some people may not be listening to the same degree or notice what 
is not being said [e.g., the director appeared to be too quiet or disengaged]. 
I knew going into this type of meeting that there was a high likelihood that 
we would have some production issues to address. As a result, I guided the 
conversation to make sure he engaged with the project and thought through 
the production.
Harpham: The prompting questions—What about X? What about Y?—play 
a role in helping the person to engage in the process?
Fleming: Yes exactly. Those kinds of specific prompts often bring better 
results than an open-ended question, like: “Can you think of anything that 
might cause a problem?” A vague question often leads to a vague answer.
Harpham: What inspires confidence in you when you see another project 
manager in action?
Fleming: Adaptability to changing circumstances comes to mind. I like to see 
somebody who is confident and capable at using project processes and pro-
cedures and knows when to put those aside to move ahead on a project. 
Social media—the focus of our company—moves fast. We are building mas-
sive amounts of content in short periods of time. Therefore, there’s a risk for 
errors if project managers do not steer their ship. If a project encounters prob-
lems, good project managers will jump in to develop a solution with their team.
Harpham: How does prior experience working at agencies have an impact 
on project manager success in your context?
Fleming: Prior agency experience is critical. Prior experience is especially 
important in certain areas, such as photo and video production. The project 
manager may not personally know how to do each step of the production 
process, but they will know the steps of the process and the teams you need 
to interface with to get things done.
Harpham: Have you seen project managers join the organization without 
agency experience and how did that go?
Fleming: We move so fast that you need to have a good baseline of 
­knowledge before you join the organization as a project manager.

Chapter 8 | Kristen Fleming, Vice President of Integrated Production, 
VaynerMedia
96
Harpham: How do you mentor and guide new hires to the organization 
given that VaynerMedia has been growing rapidly?
Fleming: We have an in-depth onboarding process. Everyone who joins 
the team is assigned a project manager “buddy.” That person is going to be 
with you for the next three weeks. In addition to company level onboarding 
­activities, we have a specific onboarding process for project managers. New 
hires are walked through all the templates we use, the processes we use, 
an overview of operations, and shadow other staff. There are also applied 
exercises where a new hire is asked to build a schedule or budget and we 
review it with them. It’s almost like taking a class in our agency’s project 
management methodology for three weeks. I like to strike a balance between 
providing the support and giving people enough rope to figure some aspects 
out on their own.
Harpham: How did this onboarding process come about?
Fleming: At one point, a large number of people joined the department.  
I discussed the situation with my manager and we agreed to build out a formal 
training process. We created a living Google Docs document with details on 
our processes and capabilities. As our processes change [as is the nature of 
social media], our document is updated in real time.
Harpham: Rapid growth may bring challenges for project governance. How 
do you strike the balance between the need for speed and the need for 
governance?
Fleming: Confidence in the project processes and tools is helpful. A top 
project manager knows what processes or steps that they can safely skip in 
order to meet deadlines. However, it’s also important to recognize when too 
many corners are being cut and detect when a project is going off the rails. 
It’s a constant negotiation process to balance that out. Project managers are 
highly valued here because they bring that holistic project perspective.
Harpham: There’s significant discretion then on how and when to apply the 
project processes?
Fleming: Yes. There’s a conversation around those decisions to think through 
the implications. If we reduce the number of project review meetings or put 
two activities in parallel, it’s on the project manager to propose the solution 
and discuss it with the right stakeholders. Once we agree on the adjustment, 
it’s up to the project manager to move it forward.
Harpham: Are there project auditors or similar review processes? Would 
project managers be questioned on why they decided to skip a certain step 
after the fact?
Fleming: If the decision works out at the end of the day and the client 
is happy, that’s our top concern. After each project, we go through a post 
mortem meeting to discuss how the project went. Specifically, that means 

Project Managers at Work
97
collecting feedback from everyone on the team. I then compile that feedback 
and look for patterns. I’m looking for practices we want to keep and areas for 
change. For larger projects, the post mortem process has been highly valuable. 
It gives everyone an opportunity to be heard. In addition, this process rein-
forces the organization's values—namely, a commitment to constant improve-
ment and optimization.
Harpham: What are some of the insights you’ve gained from these post 
mortem meetings?
Fleming: Following a large video project for a soda brand, we had a post mor-
tem meeting to discuss it. As the project was unfolding, we thought the right 
solution was to assign additional staff to work on the project. Unfortunately, 
that approach couldn’t have been further from the truth.
What we needed was a small, very senior team to execute and make decisions 
without going through other people. That was a huge learning curve for us. 
In actuality, the large number of people on the project made decision-making 
and communication less effective.
This project also lacked a RACI [Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, 
Informed] process. There were numerous people spread across multiple 
­functional areas, such as the account team, creative, project management, and 
the studio. We did not define who was responsible, who was accountable, and 
so forth, for each deliverable. In particular, the lack of clear roles and respon-
sibilities between our creative team and the studio caused difficulties.
Harpham: It’s interesting how the fundamentals—like using a RACI 
­thoroughly—keep resurfacing. This suggests that we don’t need new 
approaches as much as need to use existing methods more thoroughly. Why 
do you think the RACI concept was omitted from the project?
Fleming: There were several factors at play. A big piece of it is that we still 
operate like a start-up. And because of that, we prioritize flexibility and speed 
with less rigid processes. The trade-off is less focus on basic processes like 
using a RACI. Ironically, it’s those basic processes that make an even greater 
impact when you’re moving fast on a high-stakes project.
Harpham: I think of the analogy of road rules and signs on a highway. If you’re 
going to drive 100 miles per hour on the German autobahn, it’s important that 
everyone is using the same processes [e.g., traffic rules and regulation]. In that 
sense, process and structure enable you to drive quickly and safely.
Harpham: For the reader who is currently not in project management and 
who wants to move into the project field, what advice would you give them?
Fleming: It takes a lot of initiative on the individual to take on additional 
work that goes beyond one’s regular responsibilities. Look for people you 
admire and who do good work in your organization and seek out their advice.

This goes beyond asking to meet with someone once. Ideally, this involves 
shadowing them, asking to take on some of their minor tasks, and observing 
how they do certain tasks like building a statement of work.
It’s a tough field to break into if you lack direct experience. So it makes sense 
to start small. In addition, I recommend adopting the following attitude: “Look, 
I don’t know how to do this and I want to learn it. Can you teach me?” Put 
yourself in situations where you’re not going to be the leader in the room. 
You’re likely going to be uncomfortable as you learn the new field.
Harpham: It’s an important mindset to adopt if you want to thrive in the 
field—a willingness to learn and be uncomfortable in different situations.
Fleming: Definitely.
Harpham: What books have shaped your professional thinking and growth?
Fleming: I’m drawn to books about successful women in various fields. For 
example, I enjoyed reading Tina Fey’s memoir, Bossypants [Little, Brown, 2011]. 
Other books by women comedians—like Mindy Kaling and Amy Poehler—
have inspired me. I’m impressed by their drive to succeed and their excep-
tional ability to connect with people through their work. Their humor and 
humility give me ideas and approaches on how to relate to people.
Harpham: What productivity habits and methods do you use to stay orga-
nized and clear?
Fleming: My email inbox operates like my to-do list. We use Gmail and it has 
great capabilities to filter and tag messages. For example, if a message comes 
in with an action item for me, I will label it as a task as well as which client 
or project it relates to. I usually have no more than ten unread emails at any 
time. If I have more than that, it’s a sign that I’m having an unusually hectic day.
From a time management perspective, I aim to be realistic and fair to myself 
regarding what I can achieve in a given day. I look for an hour here and there 
through the workday to sit uninterrupted and get tasks done. If someone 
attempts to book a meeting with me during that time, I decline the invitation 
and explain why. If I don’t do that, I could easily have no work time for myself 
all day. I know that I can’t be effective if I’m in back-to-back meetings all day.  
I find that people generally understand when I push back against some requests 
citing my need to get other work done.
Harpham: Looking ahead over the next several years, which trends and 
opportunities interest you professionally?
Fleming: Working with new technologies is one of the most exciting aspects 
of my work. For example, we’re getting into virtual reality and bots for Amazon 
and Facebook. Taking my project management skills and applying it to com-
pletely new technology is interesting. “I know how to build websites and apps. 
How do I translate that experience to building bots?” Those are the questions 
I’m looking forward to exploring.

Hassan Osman
PMO Manager, Cisco
Hassan Osman is a PMO manager at Cisco Systems (Osman’s views are his 
own and do not represent those of Cisco), where he is responsible for leading and 
managing a team of project and program managers on delivering projects to Cisco’s 
global clients. Prior to his PMO role, he was a senior program manager, where he 
was responsible for scoping, negotiating, planning, and executing multi-million-dollar 
projects for customers.
Before joining Cisco, Osman was a management consultant at Ernst & Young, 
where he analyzed troubled programs at Fortune 100 companies, and recom-
mended strategic plans to improve their alignment with project objectives.
Osman is the Amazon bestselling author of two books: Influencing Virtual Teams 
[2014] and Don’t Reply All [2015]. He holds PMP, CSM, and ITIL certifications, and 
is a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University and Harvard University. He regularly 
blogs about project management and virtual teams at TheCouchManager.com.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
Hassan Osman: I’ve been involved in various projects for many years. 
Thinking back to my graduate studies at Carnegie Mellon, there was a summer 
project where I served as the project manager. I led a team of six graduate 
students at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon. I learned 
all the project management basics on this project—putting together Gantt 
charts, understanding scope, defining goals, and so forth. My early roles were 
in the information security field, and my success in those roles heavily involved 
project management.

Harpham: What was the objective of the project you built during your grad-
uate studies?
Osman: The project was called SQUARE—Systems Quality Requirements 
Engineering Methodology. The Software Engineering Institute sponsored the 
project to improve software security. The objective was to build security 
directly into the development process as opposed to viewing it as an after-
thought. Our customer on the project was an asset management company 
that wanted to add security orientated software development processes into 
their organization. The project also led to several professional publications, 
including one at the IEEE.
My graduate studies focused on information security policy and management, 
which helped me understand how to defend companies from hackers. The 
focus of my studies was more on the management practices and policies, 
rather than the technical aspects, to address continuous security threats. The 
challenge was that security is a very dynamic field, and one defensive tactic 
may be successful for a time until attackers found a way around it.
Harpham: What is a project management practice that you learned the hard 
way from a failure or a challenge?
Osman: While I was at Ernst & Young [now called EY], I started in the 
information security consulting group and later moved into project manage-
ment consulting. My work focused on independent program reviews [IPRs]. 
My assignment was to analyze multi-year, multi-million-dollar projects and 
­programs to find out why they were failing, and devising solutions to get them 
back on track.
On these large efforts, I found a common thread behind many of the ­failures: the 
lack of an integrated project management schedule. This problem ­manifested 
itself as a lack of situational awareness of metrics, including an understanding 
of how much work was complete, how many milestones were remaining, and 
how resources were assigned.
I’ve worked with a lot of Fortune 100 companies in my career. You would 
imagine that they would follow top-notch practices regarding how they run 
their projects and programs. However, that’s not the case. My lesson learned 
from these experiences is that it is worth the time and effort to flesh out a 
detailed integrated schedule when you are working on a complex project.
Harpham: Why do you think that major organizations are failing to follow 
these best practices?
Osman: It depends on the situation. In some cases, the people involved lack 
the skills required to execute these best practices. There’s an idea that a high-
level project schedule shown in PowerPoint is enough to get the job done. 
That approach can work on small projects or projects with low complexity.

Project managers often struggle with how to act in the face of uncertainty. 
Many in the field view uncertainty and information in a binary way: either I 
have full information or I have nothing. In fact, information about a project lies 
on a spectrum, where you have varying degrees of information certainty along 
it. A smart way to plan and revise the plan in the face of incomplete informa-
tion is by doing what’s called “rolling wave planning.” The idea is to continually 
revise and update the plan and schedule as you acquire additional information.
Harpham: This misconception is that one creates the schedule at the begin-
ning of the project as opposed to an ongoing effort.
Osman: Exactly right.
Harpham: It sounds like the problem is not a lack of good ideas, method-
ology, or process. It appears that these good ideas are simply not used in 
execution.
Osman: A lot of times, people blame the methodology or process for their 
difficulties. In fact, they should look at the lack of adherence to the project 
process or methodology instead.
Harpham: What is your approach to managing conflict and upset stakehold-
ers on projects?
Osman: In one of my previous roles, there was a major conflict caused by a 
vague statement of work. Unfortunately, vague SOWs [statements of work] 
are not exactly rare. When you set the scope, you believe your mission is to 
deliver requirement A, but the customer reads it as A+B. It’s a contentious 
situation because you want to balance not losing the customer with not losing 
money on the project.
I’ve been in situations where you’re sitting across the table from the customer 
saying, “Here’s what I understood. But you’re telling me something different.” 
In those cases, your negotiation skills come to play because you need to work 
through the situation. The best way to approach those situations is to be as 
honest as you can. Ultimately, you have to remember that you’re dealing with 
other people—they probably have the same sort of fears and similar goals as 
you do. The customer usually understands that disagreements are based on 
business realities, such as the project’s profitability, and that you’re not “out to 
get them” on a personal level. I find that I’m able to connect with the other 
person in a disagreement when we both share our situation and the pressures 
that we’re facing. That transparency tends to encourage the other side to 
work with you instead of against you.
Keep in mind that you’re ultimately dealing with another person, rather than 
a contract. It’s a powerful paradigm shift to apply to any negotiation situation.

Chapter 9 | Hassan Osman, PMO Manager, Cisco

Harpham: What is the most complex project you’ve led and what did you 
learn from that experience?
Osman: I led a $45 million two-year collaboration program at Cisco. I served 
as the senior program manager on this effort and we delivered this program 
to a Fortune 100 company in the pharmaceutical industry. I led a dedicated 
team of fifteen engineers and five project managers [with other staff on a 
part-time basis] to deliver an audio-video communication solution that would 
be used by 80,000 users across the world. My assignment was A to Z deliv-
ery: initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, closing, and handing it off to 
Day 2 operations. The project was complex because we had to integrate 
multiple communication technologies—audio services, WebEx, telepresence, 
and network services. In addition, we had to deliver this program on a global 
scale—the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, China, Japan, and 
other countries. It was one of the most challenging projects I’ve led so far.
Even though we had some issues with the program, I’m pleased to say that the 
customer was happy with the results. That’s what ultimately matters.
Harpham: What was most challenging for you on this project from a leader-
ship standpoint?
Osman: We had people who were used to working in silos and had to bring 
them together to work on the project. In this context, I define working in silos 
as individuals being isolated in their roles and not interacting with a larger 
team to think through dependencies that might affect what they’re doing. For 
example, an engineer working on a document to draft requirements without 
collaborating with other engineers on different technologies—that could be 
a dependency. It was challenging because I needed to change the mindset and 
behavior of the team members, and that’s not always easy when they’re used 
to working in a certain way.
As a senior program manager, my role was to make sure that the various 
project work streams were communicating frequently and effectively. Further, 
each project team needs to understand how their work supports and impacts 
other project teams. Everyone was under a lot of stress to deliver on the 
project, so it’s natural to focus on your own work and goals.
Harpham: In that context, it’s understandable that people will want to focus 
their effort on what they can directly control as opposed to the program 
­during stressful work periods.
Osman: That’s a common problem. Many program managers face this 
­challenge. You are partly fighting against human nature. It’s easy to focus on 
what you can control.
Harpham: That’s part of the value of program management. You can point 
out: “If you take that approach, Jane will fail. If Jane fails, the entire ­program is 
at risk.”

Project Managers at Work

Osman: Absolutely. The key is to foster a “one team” mentality across mul-
tiple projects. We either hang on together or we hang next to each other.
Harpham: In your consulting work and your current assignment, you have 
the opportunity to see many project managers in action. What are you seeing 
regarding recurring blind spots for project managers?
Osman: First, the failure to identify the right stakeholders for the project at 
the beginning. Over and over, people may get into the project execution phase 
before they realize that there was a person with a huge stake in the project 
and they were not involved. In some cases, it could be that a senior leader at 
another division is working on something that requires a project to be put 
on hold.
For example, we once started a wireless technology implementation project. 
Several months into the project, right in the middle of installing access points 
in one of the buildings, we were told that we should pull them all out because 
an executive in another division had already approved a major renovation 
project for that building. Had that executive been involved from the get-go, we 
would have delayed the entire project until after the renovation was complete.
When I studied for the PMP certification, stakeholder management had just 
acquired greater recognition in the PMBOK Guide. Specifically, I noticed the 
emphasis on properly identifying stakeholders in the initiation phase. It’s impor-
tant to identify and engage all stakeholders, whether they are a ­supporter of 
the project or not. PMI’s increased recognition for stakeholder management 
is helping to address the situation, which many project managers struggle to 
effectively work with stakeholders.
The second blind spot is scope creep. The challenging aspect is that scope 
creep occurs gradually. They call it “creep” for a reason. You may not notice 
the problem until it is too late. There’s a tension between striving for cus-
tomer satisfaction and maintaining your commitment to schedule and scope. 
If the scope keeps getting adjusted, you’re unlikely to hit your deadlines.
Harpham: Regarding the blind spot with stakeholder management, how 
do you navigate political considerations to engage effectively in a large 
organization?
Osman: There are two ways to identify and work with stakeholders in a large 
organization.
First, start off with a top-down strategy. Whenever possible, you want to 
engage the leaders of a group. Leaders tend to be well connected internally 
and have a broad perspective. They can help think through how the project 
will impact the company. I like to start with a simple email where I introduce 
myself, explain the project objective in one sentence, and ask whether the 
project will impact their work. The email ends with the request: “Who do 
I need to work with on your team to make sure we are aligned for success?”

Chapter 9 | Hassan Osman, PMO Manager, Cisco
106
If you’re based in an organization with thousands of people, you cannot reach 
every single person or department. For example, if you are running a technol-
ogy project, focus your efforts on senior technology leaders like chief infor-
mation officers [CIOs]. This approach works though there is an art to doing 
it well.
The second strategy is “inside out.” Start with your list of core stakehold-
ers and ask each one for suggestions regarding who will be impacted by the 
­project. For example, I like to ask if they know of any initiatives currently 
in progress that may affect the project. If so, who should I connect with to 
discuss that concern? It’s a bit of grunt work to get this done admittedly. 
However, the onus is on the project manager to think through these issues 
and reach out, over and over again, to stakeholders to make sure all the right 
people are involved.
Ultimately, the project sponsor will need to make a decision on how much to 
engage certain stakeholders. Before the sponsor gets involved on stakeholder 
issues, the project manager needs to do their due diligence to identify the 
stakeholders.
Harpham: You may start by identifying ten stakeholders on the project and 
then seek their assistance in identifying additional stakeholders and their 
­significance to the project.
Osman: That’s right.
Harpham: Let’s explore your current assignment at a Cisco project manage-
ment office [PMO]. There are different types of PMOs—some set standards, 
others provide training, and others directly run projects. How do you deter-
mine if you’re being successful in the PMO context?
Osman: The PMO plays several functions: developing processes and directly 
leading projects. The organization also plays a role in financial management: 
understanding revenues and expenses on the projects that we run. I think of 
my PMO as a “hands on” PMO. We actually deliver the projects through our 
project, program, and portfolio managers. I demonstrate that we’re success-
ful in several ways. The success and skill development of our people is an 
important measure. Standard project management metrics are also part of 
our measures: budget, schedules, and profitability.
Harpham: Regarding the people development aspect—what does that look 
like? Is there a career path to grow professionals from the project manager 
role to the program manager role?
Osman: We use a “three E’s” perspective: education, experience, and expo-
sure. For education, that means ensuring that people get project manage-
ment training, leadership training, and certifications. For exposure, this means 
observing [i.e., “shadowing”] and assisting on progressively larger projects 
over time. Finally, experience matters in order to build skills and confidence.

Project Managers at Work
107
The book The Start-up of You, by Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha [Crown 
Business, 2012], has been a helpful resource in my thinking in this area. The 
authors point out that the value and depth of work experience varies con-
siderably. For one person, twenty years of experience means “one year of 
experience repeated twenty times.” For another person, their twenty years of 
experience may have covered a variety of tasks and increasing responsibility.
My philosophy as a PMO leader is to focus on growing people with new 
experiences and challenges. You don’t want to simply repeat what you did last 
year. Instead, I think you ought to build on past experience as a foundation to 
reach new heights.
Harpham: The combination of development activities is helpful. In certain 
areas, a seminar may be the right way to develop. In other cases, the person 
may need to be challenged with a new responsibility.
Osman: That’s right. You want to coordinate all of these activities together 
with a professional development plan. Take into account where you are today 
versus where you want to go. Then you can use the three E’s—education, 
exposure, and experience—to move toward your career goal.
Harpham: What are your thoughts on the agile project management 
methodology?
Osman: In its purest form, I think of agile as a product development meth-
odology. I’m not involved in developing new software or products in my PMO 
management role. However, I see value in using agile concepts in our process. 
I like the idea of developing a process, experimenting with it, and using the 
“fail fast” concept. If it doesn’t work out, we learn from the process and can 
adjust accordingly.
Harpham: It’s helpful to keep agile’s origins in software product develop-
ment. It may be difficult to apply it in some contexts. For example, if someone 
makes a mistake on software code, it can be corrected with relative ease. If a 
mistake is made with the foundation of a skyscraper, it’s much more difficult to 
adjust that error. Perhaps agile will evolve further to adapt to other contexts 
in the future.
Osman: Absolutely.
Harpham: You’ve created an online course on managing virtual teams. Why 
did you create the course and what is your approach to the topic?
Osman: I saw a need in the marketplace for better understanding of how 
to manage virtual teams. Over the past twenty years, we’ve seen a steady 
increase in virtual team activity across the world. There’s a different skill 
set required to manage a virtual team effectively compared to a traditional  
co-located team. When you’re in the same physical space, you can read body 
language and better understand mannerisms. Keep in mind that we’re a social 

Chapter 9 | Hassan Osman, PMO Manager, Cisco
108
species—we work best when we’re face to face with others. However, that 
working arrangement is being disrupted with the rise of virtual teams.
In my current role at Cisco, I work from home ninety-five percent of the time. 
I lead a team that is spread across the east coast of the United States and 
other global locations. In the past, I’ve led teams across nearly every time zone 
in the United States, as well as various international locations. Those experi-
ences have equipped me with a new skill set.
Trust is the biggest challenge involved in managing virtual teams. For example, 
how can I trust that people are getting their work done? In the course I teach, 
I break trust down into a simple formula. Trust equals reliability plus likability. 
That means you can increase trust by increasing reliability, likeability, or both. 
It’s also important to view trust on a spectrum—it’s not an on/off switch 
[trust vs. no trust].
To increase reliability, there are several methods. At the beginning of any proj-
ect, you want to verify the skills of the project team members. Make sure that 
they are qualified to do the job at hand. Leading by example is another strat-
egy that I cover in my course. As the project manager, you need to be explicit 
at what you want, especially in a virtual team environment where you lose a 
lot of facial and body language signals.
Increasing likeability is another method to pursue. There are a lot of studies 
that show that people who like you end up trusting you more. There’s a ten-
dency to be more transactional—exclusively focusing on business activities—
in a virtual team environment because there’s no watercooler chitchat. To 
counter that tendency, I recommend making time for team building exercises 
and allocating a few minutes on conference calls for social matters. Finally, 
look for an opportunity to have at least one in-person meeting to build inti-
macy and cohesion for the team.
Harpham: Viewing trust as a spectrum is helpful. That perspective means 
that we can gradually improve trust levels over time. Anything else you would 
like to add on virtual teams?
Osman: Managing offshore teams is a subset of managing virtual teams. To 
succeed, it’s important to look for nuances and look for cultural factors that 
may shape how people interact with you. In some cultures, there’s a view that 
saying no is rude, so you have to manage around that.
The best way to address this is to use a softer message and approach than 
a direct no. For example, stating disapproval by starting with: “I see it differ-
ently…” and then explaining your point and asking, “What are your thoughts 
about that?” or “Would that work for you?” to have them agree to your “no” 
through consensus. Some cultures have to “save face,” - a direct no would be 
too harsh for them to digest.

Project Managers at Work
109
As the project manager, you have to adapt your communication style to suit 
the team.
Harpham: The perspective on saying no or raising objections is interesting. 
Project managers sometimes ask their teams to challenge them or present 
new ideas. However, if the project team comes from a culture that highly 
­values authority or deference to leaders, that request may fall flat.
Osman: Absolutely. In other cases, developing a consensus is a challenge.  
I have seen a case where challenging someone older than you is considered 
rude. For the project manager, it’s important to understand these nuances.  
If you are unaware of these issues, it’s easy to significantly add time to the 
­decision making process and slow down the project.
Harpham: Building on the communication theme, let’s turn to your book 
Don’t Reply All on email best practices. What are some of your effective email 
practices?
Osman: I was looking to solve a specific problem with the book: we’re all 
struggling with a high volume of email. In many cases, email is the default 
mode of communication given that people have different schedules and may 
be working in different locations. Ultimately, improving the quality of email 
communication is my main concern.
Over the years, many people have stopped reading emails in depth. Instead, 
they have developed the habit of quickly scanning their emails. I know some 
people who simply delete emails that are more than a few paragraphs long on 
the assumption that those urgent matters will result in a call or a follow up. 
Writing an extremely long email puts the onus on the reader to interpret and 
understand what you’re saying.
Let’s start with the “reply all” email feature. This is one feature that you should 
use with care. You want to avoid sending irrelevant messages. Many people 
use this feature in a casual way, which adds to email overwhelm.
If you’re assigning a task in an email, I recommend using the “three W’s”: who, 
what, and when. Every task should have all of those in order to be understood. 
If you’re sending out an email to your team, an action should be addressed to 
a specific individual [the “who”]. The “what” is an explicit description of what 
you want to happen. Finally, the “when” should be a specific time and date—
the deadline. You can write an action item in a single bullet point as long as 
you address the three W’s of who, what, and when.
Another problem is to write an email to your entire team by stating some-
thing like: “Hey team, I need X.” The problem with that approach is that you’re 
not assigning a clear owner for the task. In that case, the bystander effect kicks 
in—where each individual tends to assume that someone else will step in to 
handle the issue, and therefore, nothing happens.

Chapter 9 | Hassan Osman, PMO Manager, Cisco
110
Finally, having a clear “what” is important. If you write that you want a short 
report on a topic, you need to be clear. Short might mean half a page or five 
pages, depending on who reads the email. The message needs to be direct and 
clearly describe what you want.
Regarding email length, I recommend writing emails that are five sentences 
or less. When an email gets too long, the recipient would likely get confused 
because they would be unclear about whether the sender wants them to do 
something or just be informed about general information. If an email is strictly 
meant to inform someone, I recommend writing FYI [for your information] at 
the beginning of the email to clarify that point. The five-sentence rule is a heu-
ristic rather than an absolute guideline. I also like to write a short ­summary at 
the beginning of the message. The approach is based on a common Internet 
abbreviation: TL;DR [too long; didn’t read].
In cases where you have a lot to communicate in an email, I recommend break-
ing the message into two parts. The first part is labeled “quick ­summary”, 
which is five sentences or less. The second part is labeled “details”, which 
adds all the details and supporting facts you consider relevant. For example, if 
you expect the reader to take an action or deliver something, put that request 
into the quick summary section and tell them that the supporting details are 
below.
Harpham: What are some of the books that have been significant to your 
professional growth?
Osman: I’m a voracious reader of non-fiction books. I’ll mention The 4-Hour 
Workweek by Tim Ferriss [Harmony, 2007]. The book points out how to use 
the 80/20 principle in your work. You have to be effective first [choose the 
right, high-value tasks to work on] before you become efficient [optimizing 
your approach]. That’s a lesson that has been powerful to apply.
Harpham: What does your personal productivity system look like?
Osman: My approach has been influenced by David Allen’s excellent book 
Getting Things Done [Viking, 2001]. I’m a big believer in the fact that if you don’t 
write down tasks or other important data, they will disappear. If I’m in a meet-
ing with someone and the other person doesn’t write down tasks, that’s a red 
flag to me. I’ll become concerned that the task will be forgotten. In our world, 
there’s no way to keep up with all the information coming your way unless you 
use a system of some kind. In some cases, I may write up a meeting summary 
email to make clear what I expect to happen.
Harpham: What emerging trends and opportunities in business and technol-
ogy over the next three to five years have your interest?
Osman: I believe that work arrangements will continue to move to a virtual 
context. I think virtual work adoption will increase dramatically. Technologically, 
the tools and infrastructure that support virtual work are becoming better 

Project Managers at Work
111
and more widely available. Economically, virtual work arrangements are an 
attractive way for companies to reduce expenses, such as office rental and 
upkeep. Virtual work also means you have access to talent from across the 
world as opposed to your local area. This trend means professionals will need 
to develop their communication skills to higher levels, including developing 
better skills with phone and email communication. Likewise, delivering a pre-
sentation through an online tool like Cisco’s WebEx will rise in importance.
Virtual work is also a way to address growing demands for work/life balance. 
For instance, I am unlikely to accept a traditional job at a different organiza-
tion because of the excellent flexibility I have with my present role. Virtual and 
work from home arrangements are also an excellent way to reduce commut-
ing and pollution. It’s a win-win for everyone.

Recommended books include The 4-Hour Workweek by 
Tim Ferriss and Getting Things Done by David Allen.
• 
A common failure point in large projects and programs: 
the lack of an integrated project schedule that brings 
together all work and activities.
• 
Process and methodology: Inconsistent use of a project 
management methodology or process is a significant 
threat to project success.
• 
Two strategies to identify critical stakeholders: The top-
down strategy involves engaging executives or other 
leaders to determine how or whether the project will 
impact their organization. The inside-out strategy is to 
ask your project team and well-informed stakeholders to 
assist you.
• 
Strategies to improve results with virtual teams: Look for 
ways to gradually develop trust, reliability, and likability. 
For example, resist the tendency to act in a purely trans-
actional manner when interacting with virtual teams.

Bruce Harpham: How did you first get exposed to the world of project 
management?
Ilana Sprongl: By accident! In the late 1980s and the early 1990s, proj-
ect management wasn’t yet a career path. Project management offices were 
starting to become more common. I found myself running small projects to 
improve business processes. It was the dawn of Microsoft Office and I helped 
small businesses build out their processes and use this technology. I worked 
with yoga studios and other small companies. It was a step-by-step process: 
defining what you will do, making sure that your stakeholders carry out the 
program, and more.
My first formal project management experience was at a dot-com company in 
the late 1990s. The company had a major client who wanted to leave because 
they didn’t understand how work was being delivered and the timing. I put in 
place a project management process for that client using a waterfall process. 
Subsequently, that process was rolled out across the company.
Harpham: What was the nature of the dot-com company?
Sprongl: It was a software-as-a-service company serving the ecommerce 
industry. The company has since gone out of business. They built websites for 
a number of companies selling gifts, flowers, and clothing. This was the first 
time that I thought about project management as a profession and what it 
meant for a company to use it. I also learned the kind of support that project 
managers need to be successful.
Harpham: Client frustration was a driving force for project management in 
that company?
Sprongl: They wanted to know what they were going to get and when.
Harpham: At what point did you move into the banking industry?
Sprongl: I joined TD in 2010. I joined the online channel to help build the 
PMO for that area.
Harpham: Was this PMO in existence before?
Sprongl: The whole group was new. At the time, TD had a central EPMO 
[Enterprise Project Management Office] for the whole company. They had 
some basic guidance for project managers to use. We built out a much more 
detailed methodology that was geared toward activities in the online world.
In a standard PM process, you think about going through stage gates, gathering 
requirements, and so on. That process doesn’t consider the reality of a web 
property: the need to have mockups, wireframes, and related specifications 
that go beyond a standard piece of software.
Harpham: What was the process to standardize project work? Sometimes 
these efforts to standardize are perceived as administrative overhead.  
Or these efforts can be seen as creating consistent results.

Sprongl: It was a bit of both. Some people really loved it—especially in 
areas where that had not been included in processes before. Areas that were 
impacted by the changes, such as phone channel, were included earlier in the 
process to ensure that their teams had the right tools to support the changes. 
They were happy to be included and consulted. On the other hand, those 
who had to run the checklist and do all the steps were not always happy. To 
­manage the transition, a change management perspective is helpful. What’s in 
it for everybody involved?
Consider the project manager’s perspective. In the old world, the project 
manager kept track of activities using whatever process they came up with. 
If they missed consulting or working with somebody, the attitude was: “We’ll 
catch it later.”
That approach was contrasted with a new world to get that all done up front. 
As a result, it feels like it takes longer to make progress in the beginning. To 
address that concern, we point out the benefits—that subsequent parts of the 
project run better and you have the right people in the room from the begin-
ning. That means fewer delays, rework, and stress later in the process.
When we rolled out that methodology and subsequent methodology changes, 
I found that it was better to engage the teams as you build the methodology. 
When you do that, it is easier for people to understand the benefits and you 
tend to achieve buy-in more easily.
Harpham: What would that engagement look like? Is the conversation: 
“We’re changing the project methodology. What are your suggestions?”
Sprongl: Generally speaking, I find that you’re more successful if you bring a 
proposal and request feedback rather than presenting a blank piece of paper. 
For example, here’s a new process—a new set of templates or gating pro-
cedures. And then you say, “Here’s what we’re planning on doing. What do 
you think about it? How will this work for you? Is there anything here that 
wouldn’t work for you? Why?”
I suggest avoiding handing out a blank piece of paper and asking people to 
design what they want. That approach tends to lead to chaos. It’s better to 
provide a straw man for everyone to poke at. “Here’s the model or template 
we’re thinking about. How do you feel about that? Do you think we’re missing 
anything? Is there a step that we need to add?”
When you’re going through a process redesign for project management, a lot 
of things in the old process are just there from tradition. The meaning and the 
reason behind old processes have long been forgotten. Using the Five Whys 
technique from requirements management is helpful here. Ask people why 
they want a given step or activity added. In many cases, the real reason is often 
not relevant in the current circumstances.

Harpham: What’s an example of a process that was based on tradition that 
was later revealed not to be necessary?
Sprongl: We had one step in a process where everyone staunchly informed 
us that you can’t buy hardware before a business case is approved. Well, 
that wasn’t actually the case. The actual approval was that someone had to 
approve the spending and any ongoing costs associated with it. Since ongoing 
spend was typically approved through a business case, people assumed that a 
business case process was required.
This assumption was preventing people from buying hardware in time to actu-
ally start development. Hardware can have a three- to six-month–lead time, 
depending on what you need to build on. If you have to wait until the whole 
project cost is detailed down to twenty percent accuracy to make those hard-
ware purchases, you’re easily going to extend your project timeline by a year.
If you can get that hardware approval earlier, you have better options. You 
simply need to think about the implications: Can we repurpose the hardware 
for something else if the project doesn’t go through? If we can’t repurpose it, 
what’s the cost to carry it versus the cost to delay the work?
Harpham: What kinds of hardware or equipment do you mean?
Sprongl: My background is almost entirely software development, so it’s usu-
ally something like special servers or something like that. Most organizations, 
especially large ones, have larger lead times because they don’t purchase one 
computer—they purchase five hundred at a time.
Harpham: It sounds like this was a major roadblock.
Sprongl: Right. Everybody said, “Oh, it’s policy.” But that was not the case. 
There was a complete side step of the real policy and what the policy was 
designed to achieve.
Harpham: Was there a suggestion that added to the methodology in a posi-
tive way?
Sprongl: The Five Whys concept typically occurs in requirements, business 
analyst training, or requirements management. We took that Five Whys idea 
and sprinkled it throughout governance and recommendations. The idea is 
to get to the root cause or issue by asking “Why?” five times in a row to dig 
deeper into a process or way of thinking.
When I think about reasons for project failure, scope shift is often an issue. 
People want to spend their budgets before they lose them. I’ve seen that 
in every organization that I’ve been part of. Unfortunately, that means that 
people start spending without a well-formed plan.

Often, you see cases where the project will start and people think they under-
stand the problem they have. In fact, people jump too quickly to a solution. 
For instance, they might say, “I need a database to get this information.” Well, 
the minute that you say, “I need a database,” then you’re jumping to a solution. 
The better question to ask is: “What information do you need for your goal?”
Harpham: Can you share an example of people jumping to a solution stage 
too quickly?
Sprongl: The database example I mentioned previously is common. People 
are looking for a particular piece of data, so the assumption is: “We need a 
database.” However, the data is often already in some system, so you just 
need a way to get it out. I have seen many cases where someone asks for a 
database—and that request needs to be questioned. You might not need to 
build or configure a database. Maybe what you need exists somewhere else in 
an existing system.
Harpham: Building a database would be overbuilding in that case.
Sprongl: Yes, that’s right.
Harpham: How would you approach the request differently?
Sprongl: There are different ways to think about software development proj-
ects. How modular do you want to be? How much do you want to be reusable 
versus throw away with the next version? Do you want to engage a consultant 
to build something custom? Is there existing software that you can use? Often 
when people come up with a project idea, they have software in mind.
Harpham: The idea of “I have a shiny new tool that I want to use” way of 
coming up with project ideas.
Sprongl: The requirements they put together for the requirements of the 
project are sometimes based on the shiny new tool rather than what they 
actually need. Unfortunately, that approach often leads to customization of the 
shiny new tool, which is harder to maintain and use.
A guiding principle we use is: Be clear on what you want, not just what you 
think you need. It is a concept we use in sponsor onboarding training.
Harpham: Let’s explore sponsor training. Executives are usually great in 
their field of work, but perhaps they are new to the project sponsor role. 
They want to drive the project to success, but it’s new territory at the same 
time. How do you guide an executive on sponsoring a project well?
Sprongl: At TD, we actually have sponsor onboarding. It’s a key part of what 
we do for sponsors of our major projects. I believe passionately in doing that. 
Sponsors definitely have responsibilities on their projects that they need to 
understand. They have to bring the project vision and they are the voice of 
the customer. They also bring the business value perspective: Is there value in 
building this software or project?

Chapter 10 | Ilana Sprongl, AVP, Enterprise Project Management Office, 
TD Bank Group
118
If they cannot articulate the value and vision, then we have a problem. We 
might deliver the project, but it might not be what anybody needs. It’s impor-
tant to have that conversation up front before resources are used.
Once the project vision and value is clear, the sponsor’s role expands to sup-
port. Ultimately, the sponsor is the champion of the project. If you have a 
sponsor who can’t be bothered to attend project steering committee meet-
ings or encourage project participants to do their best, then we have a prob-
lem. The sponsor also helps navigate competing priorities. Another leader 
may have different priorities and want to allocate their resources to their pet 
project. The sponsor plays a role in addressing priorities and organizational 
issues. The onus is on the sponsor to make people understand their own 
work and the benefits of the project.
Harpham: What kind of feedback do you get from people who have gone 
through this onboarding process?
Sprongl: Generally, we get very positive feedback. A lot of what I hear is 
people saying, “This is all common sense, but I never really stopped to think 
about it.” After all, we’re talking about bright, intelligent people. You don’t get 
to be an executive sponsor anywhere without being a bright person. However, 
you’re so busy with your daily job responsibilities that you don’t have much 
opportunity to think about a project and your role on it.
When an executive becomes a project sponsor, they still have all their other 
work responsibilities. Projects get added on top of everything else they have 
to do. Executives usually have very competent teams working with them and 
so we tend to assume that things will get done. In projects, the question 
becomes how well the work is done and how it will be adopted, especially 
since you may have to interact with people who are outside of your regular 
team.
Until you sit down with the executive and walk them through the project 
process, they may not fully understand it. It’s the difference between them 
saying, “Yes, that makes sense” to actively understanding what they need to 
do. When we go through the onboarding session, there’s a practical emphasis: 
“You need to support the project and this is what that means. Here’s what 
it means to run a project steering committee. You get input from peers and 
experts, but it is still your decision.”
Other points to cover include the importance of “lessons learned” and obser-
vations throughout the project rather than leaving it to the end of the project. 
For example: “What did we learn during the initiation phase? Did we engage 
all of our stakeholders effectively?” Then take that learning and apply it to next 
phase of the project.

Project Managers at Work
119
Harpham: Lessons learned can be powerful if they are done well. How do 
you ensure that lessons learned exercises create value?
Sprongl: It’s complicated. The natural inclination is to point fingers, even in 
a well-run lessons learned session. To address that inclination, we point out 
that it is a team exercise and to use “we” language in the meeting. Looking at a 
process or decision and asking how we can do better next time. That’s better 
than saying, “You didn’t talk to the stakeholders enough!” The principle is to 
encourage collaborative behavior.
Historically, I have seen teams conduct lessons learned sessions and extract 
some good nuggets of insight. Unfortunately, those insights tend to sit with 
that team. They don’t get propagated beyond four or five people. It’s impor-
tant to leverage these lessons across the enterprise.
They are critical to learn from and use to update training. I’ve found that 
everybody likes to share “lessons learned” insights, but they don’t go very far 
unless you update training, job aids, and other resources. Otherwise, there’s 
no reminder to put that insight into action.
Our sponsor onboarding process includes the lessons learned from past 
sponsors. That’s an example of connecting lessons learned back to your pro-
cesses. If you don’t do that, the lessons learned insight doesn’t add much value.
Harpham: I like the idea of using lessons learned to adjust and improve pro-
cesses. Can you share an example of how a process was improved through 
lessons learned?
Sprongl: We built the sponsor onboarding process initially because we real-
ized that sponsors needed better training in how to be effective. Our meth-
odology is under continuous improvement. It’s not static. We’re always getting 
feedback. If you see a pain point occurring over and over again in every large 
project, then there’s probably some enterprise-wide problem or issue to 
address.
Harpham: How have you developed a project management career path at 
TD Bank Group? 
Sprongl: TD has always invested in its employees and employee develop-
ment. As the EPMO, we’re interested in the health and well-being of our proj-
ect managers. We want people to be happy with their career at the company.
Fifteen or twenty years ago, few people selected project management as a 
career. Today, there are college and university programs in the field. Many 
people in the field right now did not start their career with that background.
Most of the project managers I know came up through consulting or business 
analysis that fell into managing things. Project management itself grew up a 
little strangely. That’s one reason why the project management career path 

Chapter 10 | Ilana Sprongl, AVP, Enterprise Project Management Office, 
TD Bank Group
120
is not well defined. The traditional career path in the field was that you get 
to “senior project manager” level and eventually leave the organization to do 
independent consulting.
The career path that we have developed includes senior-level roles. People 
can continue in project management at our organization and become execu-
tives. When you’re running the largest projects and programs in the bank, 
you need to be an executive. It’s a cross-enterprise effort that needs a person 
with the authority to lead multi-million-dollar projects and programs. We 
have vice presidents who are managing large programs at the bank. That is a 
relatively new concept. Relatively few executives have their focus on delivering 
a program.
Harpham: Was that career option available five or six years ago?
Sprongl: Five or six years ago, it didn’t really exist in my experience. A small 
number of few senior project professionals came in on a contract basis, did 
their work, and left. When those people leave, the organization loses all of 
that knowledge and experience. There was a knowledge drain impact. At the 
same time, the organization needed another person to run a large program 
and there was nobody on the bench internally to do that.
Developing a project management career path is good for the organization—
to retain and grow talent. For the employees, we also considered the question: 
“What if they want to do something other than project and program manage-
ment?” In that case, another option is portfolio management versus the other 
path—executive program management. Both of those options go up to the 
executive level.
Harpham: Does the growth of the project management career path translate 
into growth in the absolute number of project managers at the organization?
Sprongl: We certainly have more executive-level project professionals than 
we did a few years ago. I would estimate that TD has somewhere close to one 
thousand project managers across the organization including business and 
technology project roles.
Harpham: The 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath had a major impact on 
the banking industry. Regulatory agencies make more demands. Governments 
passed new laws to regulate the industry. How has that change translated into 
the selection and nature of projects in your world?
Sprongl: The portfolio of projects we do has shifted. Across the news, you 
see regular announcements of new changes in regulations. Any time there is 
a regulatory change in Canada or the United States, TD has to respond to 
that change. Typically, that means we have a new project to respond to those 
requirements. The number of regulatory compliance projects has increased 
along with spending on such budgets.

Project Managers at Work
121
Harpham: Has this environment also impacted other projects, such as proj-
ects to develop a new app?
Sprongl: I don’t think so. Compliance is always engaged in projects at 
some point on all of our projects. Even back in the ecommerce company 
that I worked at, there were regulations to consider, such as PCI compliance. 
We had to address those requirements. Otherwise, you get fined or suffer 
other consequences. In terms of regular projects, compliance, legal, and other 
functions are just as involved now as they were before the crisis.
Harpham: Does regulation change impact the speed of the organization?
Sprongl: We need to make sure that we address regulatory changes as 
required. But it is a balancing act. If we move too fast, we could be burned. 
That is, have significant extra work to do after we launch something new—
to deal with the regulatory impact. It comes down to the question of your 
risk tolerance. Are you willing to take the risk and potentially damage your 
brand? Or do you wait, see what happens, and then act as a late adopter? It’s 
a strategic decision for the business to make. There’s a reason they call it “the 
bleeding edge of technology.” They say “bleeding” for a reason. Sometimes you 
can get cut.
Harpham: When it comes to the largest projects—the projects with the 
potential to impact the entire company—how do you assign the right people 
to lead these projects?
Sprongl: It’s complicated. I don’t think there’s any cut-and-dried assessment 
to say, “Fill in this questionnaire and we’ll know if you’re ready to lead.” It’s 
a combination of experience—“Do you have the right experience in that 
area?”—and other factors like executive presence. In large projects, you are 
going to interact with executives—the CEO or other leaders. Are you ready 
to do that activity?
You could have the best project manager in the world—someone who does 
well with their team, but then can’t speak to a leader. In that case, that person 
would be ineffective in leading that kind of project. However, those gaps can 
be addressed with a strong communications team. It goes beyond the individ-
ual leading the project. You also have to give thought to the support structure 
involved in the program.
Harpham: The star performer is only part of the equation. It’s also important 
to look at the supports they can draw on.
Sprongl: If we took a really large program, like a train system or a giant soft-
ware suite, the program manager is going to be responsible for understanding 
the dependencies. They need to know the budget, the key people on the team, 
and the stakeholders. That said, the program manager isn’t going to know 
every single detail of the program and the projects. You might have a testing 
specialist who makes sure that the system works end to end, for example. 

Chapter 10 | Ilana Sprongl, AVP, Enterprise Project Management Office, 
TD Bank Group
122
The program manager would rely on their team for support. The program 
manager’s role includes digging into problems and solving those issues.
A combative, non-friendly project manager is probably not the person you 
want sitting on top of a megaproject. On the other hand, they don’t have to 
be the expert at everything. Other people on the team need to be there for 
support and expertise.
Harpham: What are some of your personal productivity and organizational 
habits and methods?
Sprongl: The most useful technique is using a task manager. I use Microsoft 
Outlook. Everything I need to do in terms of my personal work tasks goes 
into that. If the task has a due date, I get reminders to prompt me to start 
working on it. It’s the little things that you can lose track of. The big things 
tend to be front and center, so you don’t tend to forget those.
The other point is to be honest with yourself about what you’re going to 
accomplish in any given day. People make promises to themselves, like: “If I can 
get through these five tasks, then I can do something else.” Those five tasks 
might not be realistic to achieve. If it’s going to be really hard to get through 
those tasks, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment.
For example, you might say to yourself, “If I get these five tasks done, I’ll go for 
a coffee after work.” Well, you got four tasks done. So you’re exhausted and 
you go for the coffee anyway. We’ve all done that. You need to be realistic 
about what you can achieve.
In sales, they have a saying: Under promise and then over deliver. Set realistic 
goals for yourself. Set goals that you can achieve in your work.
Harpham: I’ve heard the suggestion to only book yourself up to the sixty to 
eighty percent level. If you go to one hundred percent booked and something 
changes, the stress level goes through the roof.
Sprongl: That’s exactly right. The general rule of thumb is that nobody works 
more than eighty percent of the day on actual work. There’s coffee, conversa-
tions, and so forth. Even if you work through lunch, you’re still probably only 
about eighty percent productive. People forget this principle when they set 
expectations for productivity for themselves and others.
The better approach is: “I will get these three tasks done today and I’ll do 
more if things happen to go smoothly.” Make realistic commitments that you 
can keep. Don’t overcommit yourself in the hopes that you’ll make up for the 
time later. It’s a commitment to yourself, not to other people.
At the end of the day, you go home with yourself, not your boss. If you keep 
disappointing yourself, that’s not good for morale. Lower morale leads to 
lower productivity and other problems.

Project Managers at Work
123
Harpham: I think some people are drawn to project management because 
they have an achievement orientation: I can check off that I completed this 
task or project. There’s a potential shadow side to that tendency if you push 
it too far.
For the reader who is in another line of work, perhaps they’re a software 
developer, and they’re intrigued by project management. What is the entry 
point to get started in project management?
Sprongl: In today’s world, it would greatly depend on their background. If you 
were a software developer, you might transition to a technology team lead 
role. After that, you might look into moving into project management.
For a student still in school, I would say to take some project management 
courses. After you graduate, look for a junior project manager or project 
coordinator role. It depends on your situation. Project management isn’t a 
trade and there’s no set apprenticeship.
Taking courses is never a bad idea. In fact, I have no PM letters after my name. 
I started my career before project management certifications were widely 
recognized. However, today is different—earning those certifications shows 
your interest in the career. It’s a way of saying, “Yes, I’m serious about proj-
ect management.” You can earn an entry-level certification, like the CAPM 
[Certified Associate in Project Management] from the Project Management 
Institute, to get started.
I recently did some volunteer work with an organization where I trained 
them on project management. In that context, their projects included organiz-
ing events. I liken project management to baking a cake for an event. What’s 
the scope? I’m making food for a potluck. What kind of dessert? A chocolate 
cake. Here’s the ingredients, here’s the timing, and all the other factors. Baking 
a cake is a mini project.
When you start thinking about your life in those terms, you start to see 
projects everywhere. Once you see those activities as projects, you can use 
project management methods to achieve better results. You likely have some 
experience from your life that can be seen as a project.
Harpham: What are some insights that you’ve learned from mentors over 
the years? 
Sprongl: I had a manager tell me early in my career, “Control is an illusion.” 
When you think about being a project manager, it’s all about control. So, it was 
interesting to keep that concept in mind. You can suggest and you can plan, 
but you’re not really controlling anything. It made me take a hard look at what 
I was doing. That observation impacted my entire management style.
We’ve all seen the dictator project manager. I was probably one of those 
earlier in my career. My manager at that time basically told me to quit that 

Chapter 10 | Ilana Sprongl, AVP, Enterprise Project Management Office, 
TD Bank Group
124
approach. If you want people to do things, you have to be nice to them. If 
people don’t want to do something, it doesn’t matter if you have it in your 
plan. They have to want to do it.
There’s some research circulating around that suggests that people quit their 
manager, not their company. In my experience, that’s true. If you’re a com-
mand-and-control project manager, people are not going to want to work 
with you. You need to remember that projects are a team effort.
Harpham: Looking ahead over the next four to five years, what do you see 
as trends that are impacting project management in your context?
Sprongl: I think the definition of a project is going to shift. We still have 
megaprojects going on. However, if we look at the research, big projects rarely 
achieve their goals. Given that, how do we achieve our goals with small, nimble 
projects? Agile plays into that trend. Small, fast projects are likely to become 
more important.
Harpham: Any final words of wisdom for readers?
Sprongl: Your team is the project, not just you. It’s all about the team working 
together to get something done.
Chapter Summary
• 
Revisit policies, processes, and traditions for value. What 
“business as usual” traditions and processes does your 
company have? Are these still adding value, or are they 
merely slowing down your projects? Use the Five Whys 
technique on your policies.
• 
Develop a career path for project managers. Sprongl has 
played a role in developing TD Bank’s career path for 
project managers. It’s an excellent strategy if you want to 
attract top talent for the long term.
• 
Executive sponsor training: Executives are busy and 
focused on their “day job.” If you want them to succeed in 
sponsoring projects, consider adapting TD Bank’s spon-
sorship onboarding process.
• 
Personal productivity: Be honest and fair with yourself on 
how much you can reasonably accomplish each day.
• 
Avoid starting with solutions. When you see a request 
for a specific solution (e.g., “Build a database for me.”), 
challenge whether that is the best solution. There may be

Jason Fried
President, Basecamp
Jason Fried is the co-founder and president of Basecamp, a Chicago-based 
company that builds web-based productivity tools that, in their words, “Do less 
than the competition—intentionally.” The company also developed and open 
sourced the Ruby on Rails programming framework.
Fried earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Arizona. He is also 
a columnist at Inc. magazine.
Bruce Harpham: How did you first get started in running projects?
Jason Fried: Initially, we ran a web design firm. Clients hired us to perform 
website development. Primarily, it was companies that already had websites, 
so the work was mainly redesign projects. At first, I was an independent 
freelancer, and eventually, I started to hire other people. Ultimately, we built 
the Basecamp application because we needed a better way to manage the 
projects that we were producing for clients.
Harpham: Were you dependent on email and similar tools to manage 
projects in the early days of your company?
Fried: We used email and in-person meetings to get most of our project 
work done. That’s still the way most people run projects. It’s an okay way 
to run for a time. At a certain point, you need a system and consistency to 
ensure results.

Here’s how I like to think about it: everyone knows their own mess, but when 
you work with other people, you have to get to know their messes too. That’s 
where everything gets difficult. That’s why I recommend the value of a shared, 
consistent system for the project team. That way, you don’t have go around to 
everyone on the team asking for information.
Harpham: What did the pain and disorganization look like in your experience? 
Does it mean missing client deadlines?
Fried: There were a few different problems that I faced: missed deadlines, 
things you forget to do, and tasks slipping through the cracks. It could even 
be where somebody asked you to do something and then you wrote it down 
somewhere that wasn’t reliable and easy to find, like a Post-it Note. Or you 
wrote down the task and you forgot to tell somebody else what they had to do.
There’s also the impact on the client: how the project experience feels for the 
client. Does the client think you’re organized? Does the client feel confident in 
your ability to deliver on what you say? It’s not only the fact of how organized 
you are, it’s also a question of how you are perceived by others. Simply put, do 
you have your sh*t together? Do clients believe you?
Following conversations effectively is another challenge. With email, 
conversations happen in fragments. People reply and there’s a fragment of the 
conversation. Most email apps—almost all of them—speak in replies. It’s very 
hard to get the full story about anything unless you go through a significant 
amount of quotes from past messages, use different colors, and so forth. 
It’s very difficult to understand and have that information “on the record” 
where everyone on the team can see it. Everybody manages their email a bit 
differently. Someone may have deleted a reply. Someone may have replied, but 
not to everyone.
It’s important to have one version of the truth when you’re running projects. 
Email is not going to work for that. Email lives in different places so it is not a 
shared truth. A shared, single version of the truth that everybody has access 
to is important. That means there are no questions about who said what 
when. Nobody can say, “Oh, I never saw that” or “That was never sent to me,” 
because you have a record that covers all of that in one place.
It’s not just about dropping the ball. It’s about having things on the record when 
you might need to refer to something or to prove something was discussed.
Harpham: I’ve seen projects where there is fear that an auditor will find some 
unfilled corporate requirement. People create the meeting agenda and check 
off that Bob attended. Then, everybody is asked to agree with the minutes of 
the meeting.
Fried: That’s a good process to use for some companies. You’re getting 
approvals and related points on the record. It’s important to have a shared 
resource that covers this information.

Email is not a shared record. It’s a distributed record. Fundamentally, distributed 
records are different: you don’t ever know if they are in sync. Chat has the 
same problem: it’s a fragmented record where many conversations may be 
happening at once. It’s difficult to refer back and understand what’s going on.
Harpham: How do you mange projects where the project team members 
are in different locations?
Fried: The answer is that you do nothing in person - everything happens in 
the system. That doesn’t mean you will not have occasional conversations. 
Rather, anything that is important needs to be put in the system. In that way, 
everyone has access to the same information. If three out of four people are 
in one place, that fourth person may feel left out and unable to contribute.
Our company is widely distributed. We have fifty people in the company right 
now. Thirty-five of them live in different cities around the world. The company 
grew up that way so it is part of how we operate. Every product discussion, 
every important discussion, and every tiny piece of work that needs to be 
documented all happens in Basecamp. That way, we all have a shared truth for 
our work.
When you do work in person, you have to go back and document it later. 
You’re writing down a different version of what happened because you’re 
translating a memory of what happened. That’s why it it’s important to have 
those interactions directly in the system.
This approach can be frustrating for some people who are used to being in 
meetings and operating in person. You have to think about the long-term 
benefits. Projects are often fluid—people come in and others leave. If you only 
discuss projects in person, getting somebody new up to speed is very difficult 
to do. The new person is unable to understand the conversations and what 
has been done. By having everything documented, the new person will be able 
to get up to speed much more quickly on the project.
Harpham: You’ve advocated remote work arrangements in your writing.  
As a manager, what is your approach to making remote work effective?
Fried: My view is that there is no difference between remote and local. Even 
people working in the local office work the same way as people who work in 
different places. They do it through the system—Basecamp in our case. Then, 
it’s not about remote versus local. It’s about how you work with people in 
your organization.

Chapter 11 | Jason Fried, President, Basecamp
128
I understand the traditional argument about valuing in-person work. The 
argument doesn’t stand up for me, because just being in a place doesn’t mean 
anything. Sitting at a desk doesn’t mean you’re working, it just means you’re 
sitting at a desk. Typing on a keyboard doesn’t mean you’re doing work, it just 
means you’re typing. The only way to evaluate whether someone is working 
is by looking at their actual work. The best way to look at their work is to 
look at what they produce and track their contributions. That means looking 
at what is assigned to the person, checking that tasks are getting done on time 
and which conversations they’re participating in through the system.
I have been very careful to avoid creating two cultures: one for people who 
work in the same location as me and another for remote people. You don’t 
want to treat remote people differently. You should treat people the same 
way, regardless of where they work.
If you’re local, there’s more chance to have informal conversations and that 
does tend to generate some local bias. However, that bias should not impact 
how you evaluate someone. That should be based on their work. Of course, 
this approach assumes you’re doing knowledge or information work. If you’re 
talking about retail sales or a restaurant, that’s a different situation entirely.
Regarding the local bias, it’s something to reflect on regularly. Earlier today, 
I had lunch with a few people who are in the same office as me. I can’t do that 
with people who work in different cities. It’s very important for the manager 
to avoid favoring people simply because they happen to be in the same location 
as you. That requires self-awareness.
Harpham: In reading your book Rework [Crown Business, 2010], you have 
some interesting perspectives on estimates. What is your approach to creating 
project estimates?
Fried: First of all, humans are generally terrible at making estimates.
It’s important to state realistic expectations up front. When we did projects 
for clients, my view was to fix money and time. Therefore, scope became the 
variable factor. We would always hit the budget and schedule because we had 
flexibility regarding scope.
I would ask clients, “What do you want to do?” On hearing their request,  
I would often respond with, “I don’t think we can do all of that in the time we 
have. However, I think we can do the following…”
If you want more scope, we can increase the time and money. We kept money 
and time fixed. Without that, there’s no end. Without an end, it’s difficult to 
make decisions. Of course, the project could end when you run out of money. 
However, that’s a problem because the project is in limbo and the client is 
probably unhappy with the “result.” My feeling is that you should always have 
something that is finished. If we get to the end and we don’t deliver what we 
promised, that’s on us as the project manager.

Harpham: Your observation is an interesting contrast to what I see on some 
enterprise projects. The scenario could be a $5 million enterprise project 
and the sponsor wonders to herself, “Well, I spent the money, we’re eighteen 
months into the project, and I don’t have any improvement to my systems. 
However, the project manager is still telling me that the project is on track but 
I don’t have an end product.”
Fried: It’s basically impossible to anticipate every variable that will come up 
over a two-year period. That’s why almost every long-term project exceeds 
the budget and schedule. Estimating a project over a two-year period is 
unrealistic. We would never take on projects like that as a general rule. If we 
did take on such a long-term project, I would never say, “This will be done by 
this date.”
I would look out a few months and make a schedule estimate at that range. 
That tends to work much better. The secret is to make short-term estimates 
on your projects. Finish that amount of work and then make an estimate for 
the next chunk of work.
At our company, we only plan work out in six-week increments. We know 
there is a whole lot more than six weeks’ worth of work to be done but we 
only plan for six weeks. Even with that restriction, we get it wrong sometimes 
and have to adjust scope. If you’re trying to plan out a project with a two-year 
schedule and achieve something complicated, like an ERP [enterprise resource 
planning] implementation, it’s just not going to work.
Many in the industry cheat or lie when it comes to promising these big projects. 
The consulting firms know it’s impossible to deliver a complex technology 
project on time, on budget, and on scope. Unfortunately, the client doesn’t 
know that. The client thinks that they’re hiring a large consulting firm and that 
the consultants know what they’re doing.
I should also add that I haven’t run large multi-year projects. But I have heard 
horror story after horror story about these projects. I have intentionally 
focused on short-term projects because that’s the only way I can be responsible 
to an estimate.
Harpham: Interesting to hear about the six-week planning rule. It almost 
seems that the further one plans into the future, the higher the “fantasy 
quotient” on the plan.
Fried: Exactly right. The further you attempt to plan into the future, it gets 
much more difficult to be accurate. It is pure fantasy to plan out years into the 
future. People aren’t able to plan out what they will be doing in their own life 
in two years, so why would that approach work on a project?

Chapter 11 | Jason Fried, President, Basecamp
130
Returning to the example of the multi-million-dollar ERP project, they may 
get it done. However, it’s not done well. For instance, they may achieve their 
schedule but sacrifice quality. The system may be implemented but you may 
have to redo it to get the functionality you truly want.
In almost every case, shorter timelines on projects are the better way to go. 
In that way, you get into the routine of delivering smaller amounts of scope 
with reliability. You can then repeat that process until you complete the whole 
effort.
Harpham: What is your approach to designing “quick wins” on projects?
Fried: Let’s take the client perspective. Recently, I was the client for a house 
construction project.
My architect and the contractor were the firms that I hired to do the project. 
As a client, it’s very enlightening. I realized that you want to see progress on 
the project as a client.
Showing any progress is great. For example, I was excited to get an update 
from the project team. The contractor’s update simply provided new pictures 
of the project—even when it was nothing more than a hole in the ground for 
the foundation. Technically, that wasn’t a milestone on the project that the 
client needs to know about. However, that’s absolutely what the client wants 
to see—evidence of progress. By designing for small wins, it’s easy to show 
progress to the client on a regular basis as you progress through the project. 
Delivering quick wins builds confidence, trust, and momentum between the 
project manager and the client.
If you write a check to a design firm for $20,000 and you don’t see anything 
for a while, you’re naturally going to be suspicious. You have no right to be 
suspicious but you will probably have that feeling anyway.
However, if you receive updates from the design firm, such as, “Here’s some 
early ideas for the logo and this is where we stand in the design process,” 
that makes a big impact. Show the client that you are doing work and making 
progress on the project. I know a lot of design firms are afraid of showing work 
that is unfinished, because they’re worried about creating a bad impression. 
However, you can easily address that possibility by explaining it to client: “This 
is a preliminary concept for the project. We are still developing multiple ideas 
and we wanted to share an example of what we are doing.”
In contrast, if the designer disappears into the proverbial cave to do their 
work and doesn’t communicate for a month, the client will start to freak out. 
In this case, the client has no idea if progress is being made. The client doesn’t 
know if the designer has encountered problems or anything else about the 
status of the project.

Project Managers at Work
131
It’s about the process, sharing the work as you go, and writing frequent 
updates. Clients should get updates once per week if not multiple times per 
week. Share pictures of the hole in the ground or the equivalent for your 
work. I remember feeling wonderful that I could see progress on the house. 
Silence is bad on projects.
Harpham: There’s an unspoken assumption with some project managers 
to stay quiet until they accomplish something large, such as completing a 
milestone. Yet, silence increases anxiety for the client or project sponsor.
Fried: Silence makes the client’s concern worse and worse. Once distrust 
builds up, it is very hard to recover from that. Show your work and explain 
what you’re doing to the client.
Harpham: The key is to show progress and provide updates even if progress 
made seems small?
Fried: Exactly. Project managers feel the need to deliver awesome results and 
that is the ultimate aim. Everybody understands that there’s a process and 
many steps to go through. Bring the client to the cutting room floor so that 
they can see the process.
Harpham: In your book Rework, you write “Meetings are toxic.” Can you 
elaborate on your perspective? For many project managers, meetings are 
an indispensable tool. How do you minimize meetings but still achieve the 
progress and connection you need to keep moving forward?
Fried: Allow me to be self-serving, but Basecamp is the answer for me. The 
problem with meetings is that they’re live events. In most cases, a meeting is a 
discussion about a topic and you generally don’t need to have a live meeting 
in order to have a discussion. In some cases, it is helpful to pull a bunch of 
people into a room. But most of the time, it is better for people to write up 
what they’re thinking and add their thoughts over the course of a day rather 
than putting me on the spot in a meeting room. The added benefit is that you 
have everyone’s thoughts on the record.
People think about a meeting as an hour of time. It’s not. If you have six people 
in a room, it’s a six-hour meeting. You pulled away six people to talk about 
something that could have been written up and discussed asynchronously 
in most cases. We use meetings as a last resort if there is no other way to 
address the issue. Meetings are also difficult to organize when you have people 
in different time zones or if people are out of the office on a given day. When 
you write up the topic and allow people to respond on their schedule, you 
have the benefit of getting their input.
I know that some people may object to this approach. They may say that it is 
slower to discuss the topic over a day. In a minority of cases, the answer is yes. 
Most of time, it is incredibly inefficient to pull a bunch of people into a room 
to discuss something that doesn’t need to be discussed right now.

Chapter 11 | Jason Fried, President, Basecamp
132
Harpham: If I’m a project manager and I adopt this practice, I could go from 
twenty meetings per month to four meetings. Is that reasonable?
Fried: Yes. Cutting down the number of meetings you have by twenty-five 
percent or fifty percent would be great. The people who are doing the work, 
they need the time to get the work done. As a rule, I don’t want my people to 
work more than forty hours per week. That’s enough. Forty hours is enough.
If every person has about forty hours of work time to get their own work 
done, that’s enough. It’s not enough if the company claws back twelve hours 
per week in the form of meetings and other activities.
I think of meetings as “company time” that takes away from an individual’s 
ability to get their work done. If you put ten hours of meetings on somebody’s 
schedule, they may well have to spend fifty hours at the office to get everything 
done. That’s how you end up with people working longer hours. They are 
unable to perform well because they’re tired and burned out.
A big-picture perspective is needed when it comes to meetings. On the short-
term perspective, you may well think that it would be easy to organize a 
meeting to discuss a topic. If that is your approach on every topic and situation, 
you’re taking time away from the true work people have to do.
Use meetings occasionally. Assume that most topics and issues can be covered 
over time. If everything needs to be discussed ASAP in a meeting, you have a 
deeper problem: your time management or expectations have problems.
Harpham: The forty-hour workweek is a key premise then. If you’re routinely 
working more than forty hours, you may have a management problem.
Fried: Yes. If we take the forty-hour per week rule seriously, then you have 
to ask yourself what activities are you taking on? Are meetings adding value 
or taking it away?
In a lot of companies, meetings are a primary way to take away time from other 
activities. If you start with the principle of “My people work non-stop—whatever  
it takes to satisfy clients,” you will face consequences. You’re likely to be sloppy 
with your time and other people’s time. I think of time and attention as an 
extremely limited resource.
It’s interesting—companies typically have CFOs and they’re careful on how 
they use their money. People have to create budgets and fight for money. 
Yet, they waste people’s time like it’s free. That’s one of the broken ideas 
in modern business: the notion that time and attention are not treated as 
precious resources.
Harpham: Let’s turn to the origin of the Basecamp product. What’s the 
origin of Basecamp and how was it different from other project management 
applications on the market?

Project Managers at Work
133
Fried: Basecamp is best suited for small companies. It is best for companies 
who think about project management as a communication problem. Basecamp 
is about communication, sharing thoughts, and getting feedback—rather than 
producing Gantt charts. Most people who use Basecamp are not project 
managers. They’re people who need to run a project. It might be a designer 
or a business owner running projects and they decide that they need to get 
organized. Basecamp isn’t a good fit for Boeing, where you’re building an 
airplane or a satellite. If you’re doing client services projects, it is a great tool 
for that context.
Harpham: What drives customers to use Basecamp?
Fried: Most of our customers come to Basecamp with some kind of 
homegrown system. Typically, that’s a reliance on email, meetings, chat and so 
on. They’re coming to Basecamp from a loose system, which works well up to 
a point. Typically, they come to Basecamp once they get to a certain number 
of employees—often once they hit five or six employees.
If you have two or three employees, a lot of companies manage to operate 
with an informal approach. Yelling across the office works at that level. As you 
get larger, you need a systematic approach.
Our customers generally don’t switch to Basecamp from Microsoft Project 
or a similarly complex system. Usually, they have some kind of improvised 
approach. Once you have a few plates spinning and a half dozen people at the 
organization, you start to realize that improvised systems don’t work anymore, 
because the owner or manager doesn’t know what’s happening. Even worse, 
the manager becomes a bottleneck on productivity because staff can’t get fast 
and easy answers on what to do next.
I hear customers say, “I need a system to organize my work” rather than “I 
need a project management tool.” People are frustrated with disorganization! 
Some simple structure goes a long way toward addressing these frustrations. 
Adopting a single place to understand what people are working on. A way to 
make announcements, a way to ask questions, and so forth. They’re looking for 
a way to work. Basecamp is good for your organization if you have five to ten 
employees with no particular system in place. It doesn’t tend to be a good fit 
if your company is over one hundred people who are trying to switch from an 
established project methodology to Basecamp.
Harpham: For readers who may not be familiar with Basecamp, can you give 
an idea of the product’s scale?
Fried: We have two million companies with Basecamp accounts today. Inside 
those companies, there are dozens or hundreds of people who use Basecamp. 
We don’t charge by the “seat.” We allow an unlimited number of users per 
company to use the product for a fixed price.

Chapter 11 | Jason Fried, President, Basecamp
134
Harpham: What is your leadership approach?
Fried: I recently read a wonderful book called Turn the Ship Around! A True 
Story of Turning Followers into Leaders by L. David Marquet [Portfolio, 2013].
The author is a former US Navy captain who commanded a nuclear submarine. 
The Navy assigned him to turn around the worst-performing submarine 
around in the Navy. Improvement was objectively measured in several ways, 
including the number of sailors who want to sail on the submarine again, down 
time, and repairs needed and other factors.
Traditionally, the military is focused on orders—giving orders and following 
orders. That’s how a lot of companies operate. That’s how we used to work 
in fact.
After reading this book, I changed my perspective on leadership. He changed 
the way people worked on the submarine. He realized that if he gave orders 
to everyone all time, then only one mind on the ship was truly working hard—
his mind. Therefore, he was also the bottleneck because everyone had to 
come to him to get orders. Instead, he changed the perspective: I will no 
longer give orders except for a small number of cases, such as firing a weapon 
that could kill. Instead of coming to me for permission, I want you to come to 
me with intent.
Instead of asking, “May I turn the ship thirty degrees starboard?,” the sailors 
changed their approach to say, “Captain, I intend to turn the ship thirty degrees 
starboard.” If the Captain agrees, you have to follow through and you’re taking 
the responsibility to carry out that action. In this case, you brought the idea 
to the company and you have the intent to do it. These approaches are very 
different—asking permission versus working with intent.
I don’t ever give permission to do anything in our company any more. If you 
ask me for permission, the answer is no. Instead, you come to me with intent 
for what you plan to do. Then, I will cheer you on or ask you a few questions 
about it. The questions may help you to realize what you planned was not a 
good idea or an idea that needed to be refined. I don’t want people to ask 
permission because that puts responsibility on me rather the individual.
Harpham: What do you keep as “reserve power” to yourself?
Fried: My emphasis is on the company vision and experimental ideas that 
an employee may not feel comfortable to explore. Recently, we launched 
a change to our pricing structure. I wanted to make a change to pricing 
because I felt the pricing approach we had was too complicated. Once a year 
or so, I will say, “Here’s a big initiative I want the company to do.” How that 
gets done is partially up to me and partially up to other people.
Harpham: What is your approach to personal productivity and running  
your day?

Project Managers at Work
135
Fried: The best tool I have is the word no.
The only way to be productive is to have fewer tasks to do. I seek to avoid 
overburdening people with too many tasks, because I realize that approach 
doesn’t work. I set the example that I work on one activity at a time. I push 
back hard against people who like to multitask and switch between activities. 
I don’t use to-do lists, so I limit myself to one or two activities at a time. That 
approach forces me to focus. Over the past eight weeks, we’ve been working 
on the new rollout. That’s all I have been focused on. There are thirty to 
forty other projects going on in the company, but I don’t follow them in detail 
because my focus is on the rollout.
Once upon a time, I had the view that everyone should know everything that’s 
going on in the company. However, I found that a weekly check-in is enough. 
Each Monday morning, everybody writes a short report on what they plan to 
work on in the coming week. That’s enough information from management to 
understand the company.
Harpham: What are some of the important trends in technological or 
economic change that have your attention?
Fried: I want to help companies become calmer. There’s a real anxiety piling 
up inside many companies. I hear about it constantly.
There’s a sense that every task is ASAP and notifications are constantly going 
off. This is a toxic trend that we’re pushing hard against with Basecamp. I want 
to be able to promise our customers that if they use Basecamp, their company 
will be a calmer, saner place. What are ways we can reduce notifications? For 
example, there is a new Basecamp feature called “Work can wait.” It allows 
each person to set their own work schedule on any given day. Outside of 
those set work times, Basecamp will not send any notifications, emails, or 
other messages. All of that will be held until the next workday.

• 
Client perceptions: As you manage the project, ask yourself 
how you come across to the client. Does the client think 
you’re organized? Does the client have confidence in you? 
What can you do to show progress (e.g. sharing pictures 
showing progress on a construction project)?

• 
Support remote work. Fried’s company has successfully 
used remote work arrangements for years. The right 
tools are only one part of the story. It’s also important for 
managers to avoid “face-time bias” (i.e. showing favoritism 
to local staff over remote staff) in people management.
• 
The six-week planning rule: Fried recommends keeping 
detailed planning to a six-week horizon, and then use that 
experience to deliver the next part of the project.

Tom Atkins
President, Tramore Group
Tom Atkins, CMC, PMP, ICD.D, is president of Tramore Group. He is an expe-
rienced executive and senior program manager. He advises public and private 
sector organizations on strategy, operations, and improving the effectiveness of 
enterprise-wide project management. He is past chair of the Board of Directors 
for the Rouge Valley Health System. Tom has completed executive programs at 
the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management and UCLA’s Anderson 
School of Management.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management prior to 
establishing Tramore Group?
Tom Atkins: I’ve worked on many projects in different organizations. In 1994, 
I started TWA Consulting Services. In 1995, I acted as the lead consultant 
on the operational due diligence related to forming Symcor Services Inc. 
[Note: Symcor is an outsourced financial services company based in Canada 
that provides various services to Canadian banks, such as check processing, 
statement production, and related activities. Symcor is owned by the Bank of 
Montreal, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto Dominion Bank]. The scope 
of that project also included developing the vendor strategy and providing 
strategic advice related to establishing Symcor.
Harpham: How did you come to work on large projects, such as advising on 
the formation of Symcor?
Atkins: In brief, I was engaged by the Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank of Canada, 
and Toronto Dominion Bank to lead the operational due diligence to set up 
Symcor.

Harpham: So you received the call out of the blue one day to lead this 
project?
Atkins: The Symcor project opportunity resulted from a previous job I held. 
In the early 1990s, I was vice president and general manager for the Financial 
Line of Business at Unisys Corporation in Canada. During my time with 
Unisys, I dealt with the CIOs at various financial institutions. I led reviews of 
the cheque-processing operations and image processing viability at two of the 
Big Five banks among many other projects.
Harpham: It sounds like you have developed great depth in working with 
Canada’s leading banks. How did you develop that expertise?
Atkins: In 1977, I was national accounts manager to the Big Five chartered 
banks [Royal Bank of Canada, TD Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, 
and CIBC] for Xerox Canada Inc. In the course of that role and later roles, 
I learned about the industry in depth.
Harpham: What happened to TWA Consulting Services?
Atkins: In 2000, the company was sold to Sierra Systems Group [SSG:TSE]. 
After that sale, I ran Sierra’s business in Southern Ontario, including the 
GTA. Much of the work we did in that company involved delivering large and 
complex programs, such as Sarbanes-Oxley compliance for CIBC and Bell 
Canada. We also implemented new financial and human resources systems at 
the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. Most of the programs 
and projects we worked on at this time focused on large organizations in 
Southern Ontario and the Greater Toronto Area.
Harpham: Why did you decide to sell your consulting firm to Sierra?
Atkins: In 2000, we received several offers for the company and we decided 
to accept one of those offers.
Harpham: How did you come to form Tramore Group, a consulting 
organization focusing on program and project management?
Atkins: In late 2006, a little over a year after I left Sierra Systems, I decided 
to form a new business. I considered different areas we might work in. Many 
large organizations were not particularly good at delivering large, complex 
projects and programs. As a result, I saw a need to provide consulting relating 
to effective delivery of projects and programs.
Harpham: In the first year of the company, was the focus on the financial 
sector?
Atkins: No, the focus was on large corporations and public sector 
organizations. That includes banks but it was not limited to banks and financial 
institutions.

Project Managers at Work

Harpham: When Tramore Group comes in to assist with large projects and 
programs experiencing difficulties, what does that look like to you?
Atkins: It starts with a large organization allocating a budget in the order 
of $5 million to $100 million or more to undertake a program. Then, the 
organization would often spend the budget and not end up delivering on 
the scope. Once we receive a call for help, our first step is to assess the 
situation and understand what has caused the initiative[s] to derail. For 
that, we typically assemble a team of senior consultants with experience in 
program and project management and work with key subject matter experts. 
The result of the assessment is then presented to a senior executive team at 
the client empowered to make decisions and recover the initiative[s].
Harpham: Why do you think such project and program failures continue to 
happen?
Atkins: In large organizations, we often see an expense control mentality. 
That approach works very well in many cases, like regular business operations. 
However, that approach doesn’t tend to work well when delivering a large 
program. The default approach is line item management. For example, a senior 
leader might make decisions on who to appoint to lead these programs 
based on the cost of the individual, rather than on the basis of the individual’s 
capability and experience.
From a cost perspective, appointing a current employee to lead a program 
or project is less expensive than bringing in an independent contractor or a 
consulting firm. As a result of the expense control mentality, you end up with 
people that lack experience in doing the work. The lack of experience often 
extends to the project sponsor.
As a consequence, variances on projects tend to be misunderstood. Variances 
may not be measured at all or only detected when they are very large. When 
cost over runs occurs, it is rarely attributed to poor estimation and planning. 
Instead, there’s a view that cost over-runs are just a normal part of the process.
Harpham: It sounds like part of the problem lies in failing to appreciate the 
difference between normal operations and project/program work.
Atkins: They are very different activities. Executives at large companies 
are exceptionally well trained at running the day-to-day operations of their 
business. They tend to be concerned about client satisfaction, employee 
satisfaction, achieving service levels and responding to market pressures. They 
tend not to be focused on the need to rigidly manage the initiative’s schedule, 
rigorously police the budget, and relentlessly contain the scope.
Harpham: Can you elaborate further on “relentlessly contain the scope?” 
What does it look like when that is done well?

Chapter 12 | Tom Atkins, President, Tramore Group
140
Atkins: It starts with having a business case that defines the initiative’s 
objectives, including its financial feasibility. Second, you have to have a change 
control process that is embraced by management or whoever plays the 
project sponsor role. Those managers must insist that no additional budget 
or scope is approved without going through the process. This process defines 
the impact of the proposed change on scope, schedule, and budget. It should 
also identify how benefits vary as a result of the proposed change.
Sometimes, the discipline breaks down. Management may say, “Listen, we need 
this change. Just add it.” In that case, there’s often no true understanding of the 
impact of that decision on cost or schedule.
Harpham: There’s a perception that a small change doesn’t warrant a 
process-based review?
Atkins: Or it could be a change that is viewed as important to do. In other 
situations, the change may appear simple on the surface. However, a proper 
impact analysis may show a material impact to cost or schedule. That analysis 
generally involves elaborating the work required to fully implement the 
proposed change. Without a proper process, often we see the cross impacts 
are not identified when the change is proposed, which results in significant 
variances identified in late stages, such as the testing phase.
Harpham: Regarding implementation of this discipline, do you see cases 
where the project manager may not feel confident about challenging a manager 
or executive when that leader fails to follow the process?
Atkins: That’s one of many causes. Sometimes, you may have people who 
look at the project as “ticking off” completed tasks. They don’t really know 
how to think about the project as a whole. They may not recognize a change 
as an addition to the scope. Or they might not understand how estimates 
are constructed. For example, an activity may require X work effort and it 
turns out that 2X is required to get it done. Some people may simply assign 
additional resources to complete that activity without thinking through the 
impact to the overall budget or the additional complexities that a 2X estimate 
may imply.
Sophisticated organizations understand their internal costs for day-to-day 
operations. However, many large companies don’t recognize that their internal 
employees are a resource that costs money. Or they don’t recognize all of 
their employees in that manner.
Harpham: What do you mean that companies do not recognize their 
employees as a cost?

Project Managers at Work
141
Atkins: Consider the case of a large company with full time technology 
professionals on staff. That developer’s work on the project, such as 
developing software, is likely to be reported correctly. I see a gap in most 
the other project activities performed by employees that provide daily advice 
and input on the project design for instance. These other activities are not 
understood or recorded as part of the project cost. As a result, there is not a 
true understanding of the project’s total costs to the organization.
Harpham: Would this mean that the project’s costs are often significantly 
understated?
Atkins: Project costs are complex to understand, so consider all that goes 
into it. Consider the cost of taking the appropriate time to create estimates. 
Consider a program with a $100 million budget. It would not be uncommon for 
the project to spend $25 to $30 million to complete the detailed requirements 
and design, understand how the benefits are going to be achieved, to socialize 
the initiative internally and all of the other activities required for a successful 
delivery. This diligence will result in a reliable estimate that is plus or minus 
ten percent or so. If you take a high-level approach to estimating, you wind up 
with estimates that are plus or minus fifty to one hundred percent or more.
Imagine this process as a funnel. At the top of the funnel, we can call the top 
stage “ideation.” In that stage, you might hear something like, “We would like 
to introduce this new business function and apply it to 1,500 locations.” At 
this point, the high-level estimate might project that it will cost $50,000 per 
location. Given those estimates, the project makes sense in terms of costs and 
benefits.
The next step down the funnel adds greater detail and precision. Activities at 
this stage may include high-level requirements, design, a project charter, and 
services and products from vendors. With this additional work, the revised 
estimate may be three hundred percent higher than the prior estimate. After 
completing this additional work, the project manager may discuss the idea 
with P&L owners, business owners, and other decision makers. The decision 
maker’s response is often “We’d like you to investigate this further. Here is 
some seed money to take this to the next level. Go out, talk to some vendors, 
and get a better understanding on the program’s cost.”
If you issue RFPs [request for proposals], you will have additional information 
on prices and costs. Prices offered in an RFP are often different from negotiated 
pricing. Even though this is the case, you will have a better idea on the likely 
costs relating to vendors.

Chapter 12 | Tom Atkins, President, Tramore Group
142
At the same time, you will probably realize that you need additional support 
to integrate the program into your existing systems and processes. That work 
may require purchasing additional professional services. As the projected cost 
increases, the need for project and program management controls tends to 
come up. The program manager role then has to coordinate the contributions 
of technology groups, the business groups, corporate support areas, and so 
forth. All of those groups need to participate in order to build a successful 
program. As this work progresses, your estimate is likely in the plus or minus 
fifty to seventy-five percent range.
Later, you drive down to detailed requirements. At this stage of the process, 
you may realize that you have to build three or four solutions for a given 
function to work. You didn’t think about that fact until you started on the 
detailed requirements. As the details are developed, the cost tends to increase. 
However, the accuracy of the estimate improves. With these requirements 
in hand, you can start to think through how you will fulfill them. If you 
need development or testing, you may look at doing that activity internally, 
outsourcing it overseas or to another company. Your estimate is now in the 
plus or minus thirty percent range.
Subsequent steps of the planning look at people. For example, how much 
executive oversight is required for this program? What governance model will 
we use? Which vendors will we use and what will they cost? With continued 
work to develop these points, you may be able to get an estimate with a ten 
percent accuracy level.
To review: at the ideation stage, the estimate may be accurate to within three 
hundred percent. The next level of detail may yield an estimate accurate to 
within fifty to seventy-five percent. With detailed requirements, you may check 
to a thirty percent accuracy level. Once you select the team, hire vendors, hire 
professional services staff, and so forth, you can get to a ten percent accuracy 
level.
Harpham: Do you see a corresponding increase in the benefits side as you 
develop and better understand the cost structure of the program?
Atkins: The benefits we’re pursuing are reasonably well understood at the 
beginning of the process. The manner in which the benefits are harvested 
is better understood as you go through the planning work. Further, you will 
better understand what exactly drives the benefits. Finally, you also develop 
the method to measure the benefits as they occur.
You may generally understand the benefits you’re seeking at the beginning. 
However, you may not know what exactly will trigger those benefits until 
later. In addition, with an experienced project management team and proper 
planning process in place, the team is enabled to identify alternatives to harvest 
benefits earlier than originally thought.

Project Managers at Work
143
Harpham: Have you seen cases where the return on investment breaks down 
[i.e., costs exceeds benefits] as the planning and estimating work continues?
Atkins: Yes. This tends to happen because the costs turn out to be much 
higher. The estimated benefits don’t tend to change. For instance, we thought 
we could harvest ten dollars’ worth of benefits by spending five dollars. That’s 
a good business case. However, as we elaborate the project and develop a 
good picture on the costs. At that point, the project may take longer than 
initially assumed and have ten dollars in costs for ten dollars in benefits. That’s 
much less attractive.
Harpham: How do you approach project scenarios where the benefits 
become too costly to obtain or the return on investment is unattractive?
Atkins: There are various strategies to consider. One option is to reduce the 
scope of the program to reduce the cost while seeking the same benefits. This 
exercise can justify the cost of the program.
Harpham: Do you see organizations regularly going back to measure 
whether or not the project achieved the business case in terms of ROI or 
benefits?
Atkins: The best practice is to measure the benefits periodically while the 
program is underway. That’s important because there is a need to confirm 
that the benefits you’re chasing are still attainable at an acceptable cost. If 
the costs climb higher to attain certain benefits, then you need to have a 
discussion about whether it makes sense to continue to spend money. That 
conversation does not happen often enough.
When that conversation does happen, we rarely see programs cancelled. 
However, the program may be changed significantly and go through a re-planning 
exercise. A new approach may be needed to optimize the business case.
Harpham: You mentioned that these conversations about costs and benefits 
during the program don’t happen often enough. Why is that?
Atkins: I often see project teams focused on delivering the project with a 
heads down mentality. There is often an assumption that the project’s benefits 
will still be there. It’s incumbent on the business leader to think through the 
business needs and whether it still makes sense to continue with the project. 
Remember, it is the party receiving the benefits that has the best understanding 
of whether those benefits can still be harvested.
Harpham: What kinds of changes could prompt this type of reassessment?

Chapter 12 | Tom Atkins, President, Tramore Group
144
Atkins: Here is one type of change I see happen at large organizations. Let’s 
say the program has a budget of ten dollars per year for four years. In year 
one, the business may say, “We need to cut that budget to eight dollars this 
year because we have a challenge to meet.” In response, we will say, “Sure, we 
can do that. However, two dollars’ worth of scope will need to be moved 
into next year.” As a result, the project’s budget is stretched out over a longer 
time period. If you do that kind of change multiple times, the project may 
be completed a year later than originally planned. That means losing on the 
benefits for a year because the project completion was pushed out a year, 
plus potentially adding extra costs for keeping resources engaged longer. That 
change also means your original benefits, the time you anticipated receiving 
those benefits, and costs need to be reviewed to see if the investment is still 
attractive.
Harpham: What is your approach to guiding someone through the 
consequences of a trade-off decision in that scenario?
Atkins: As an outside consultant, our approach would be to suggest that this 
reassessment ought to be done. It is up to the client to decide if they want to 
apply the effort required to analyze the impact on the business case and the 
benefits by stretching out the investment. We have had clients that say, “No, 
we’re comfortable with the decision. Please move ahead.” And others that say, 
“We’d like to better understand the implications of this decision. Please advise 
us accordingly.”
Harpham: What do you see as the differences between a successful project 
manager and a successful program manager?
Atkins: At the project level, it’s very important to understand all of the 
stakeholders and what their success criteria are. Further, you want to 
understand what the stakeholders need to contribute to the project and 
what they expect from the project. It’s an exercise in tracking the schedule, 
the scope, and the budget at a reasonable level of detail. Governance and 
communication processes need to be developed such that the stakeholders 
effectively contribute to the project, understand the direction the project is 
going and if the project is on track to meet its objectives. Managing changes 
through a proper change process is another key responsibility. The project 
manager will help the stakeholders to understand the implications of their 
change decisions. Risk and issue management need to be understood, including 
the probability that risks will occur.
At the program level, you face similar types of challenges—but they’re on 
steroids. You may have ten or twelve projects running underneath you with 
project managers doing the work I just described. Most complex programs 
have work streams that report to the program manager and other work 
streams that work across the program [e.g., end-to-end testing, organizational 
change management, and communication].

Project Managers at Work
145
As a program manager, you have two different activities to run. Most of the 
time as a program manager, you will have a program delivery office supporting 
you. That delivery office will be led by a senior project manager: that person 
functions as your second in command. The program delivery office manages 
activities, such as change logs, the master schedule, the overall budget, and 
communications. Your job as the program manager is to spend eighty percent 
of your time with the rest of the organization and only twenty percent of 
your time with the program team. In contrast, the project manager has the 
opposite ratio: eighty percent of time spent working with the project team 
and twenty percent spent with the rest of the organization.
Complexity is a key reason for the differing points of emphasis between 
program and project managers. When you are delivering a program in a large 
company, there are usually multiple business units and corporate support 
areas [e.g., compliance, risk management, procurement, etc.], functional units 
[technology and operations], and so forth. As a program manager, it is your 
responsibility to engage with leaders in other units two or three months in 
advance of when you need them to do something for the program [e.g., assign 
a person from your group to support this part of the program].
Your job as a program manager also extends to risk. For example, thinking 
through the assumptions that may have led to a risk occurring. If a risk occurs, 
the cause may be due to an individual who is not getting the job done right. 
In fact, the problem could be due to the individual’s working style rather than 
the substance of their contribution. Clashing work styles hurt productivity. 
In that case, you may want to make recommendations to adjust the team.
The program manager’s job is fundamentally strategic in nature. They need 
to think about what the program needs next month, two months out, three 
months out, and more. Once that thinking is done, the program manager 
needs to arrange the appropriate resources and communicate to support 
that work. The day-to-day execution of project activities belongs to the 
project manager[s]. All the projects under the program are controlled and 
coordinated by the program delivery office.
Harpham: You raise a good distinction in terms of focus: mainly, external 
focus for program managers versus internal focus for project managers. The 
other distinction I noted concerned the time scale: many project managers 
focus on the week as a fundamental unit, while program managers are typically 
working on a longer time scale.
Atkins: Successful program managers are always looking one to two quarters 
out. This longer-term time horizon may not fit well with the agile approach in 
the program context. In such cases, there may be some “agile” accelerators 
that can work in waterfall programs, like co-location and daily stand-up 
meetings. However, I find that large transformational programs tend to need a 
greater emphasis on planning than is typical in an agile project.

Chapter 12 | Tom Atkins, President, Tramore Group
146
Harpham: What does planning look like in these programs?
Atkins: Detailed activities might be planned out over a time horizon of ten 
days. Over the next several quarters, there would be reasonably detailed high-
level plans. Next, there would be a high-level roadmap describing the next two 
to three years for the program. Some very large, complex programs—such as 
the cheque-imaging programs we’ve seen in large Canadian banks—don’t lend 
themselves to agile. To understand the undertaking, you have to develop a plan 
with a reasonable amount of detail all the way to the end before you start 
building solutions. In this specific example, the plan will enable the program 
team to sequence the delivery in a way that best meets the initiative’s strategic 
objectives and enables the organization to potentially harvest benefits sooner. 
In that specific example, keep in mind that there’s not much change in how 
customers write or use a cheque.
Harpham: Certainly, cheques [“checks” in US English] are a very well 
established financial product.
Atkins: Correct.
Harpham: Let’s explore agile further. There’s a view in some areas of the 
field that agile might be a magic bullet that will solve project problems. What 
aspects of agile are ineffective or inappropriate in large programs?
Atkins: Determining what aspects of agile work in large programs is something 
we’re learning right now. Some of our teams are using agile enablers, such 
as co-location and daily stand-ups. In our company, we trained our entire 
workforce in agile and have pursued certified Scrum Master training. We’re 
seeking to understand the skills and techniques and how others might be 
using [or claiming to use them].
What we have found from our experience is that the core principles behind 
the Agile Manifesto should always be present in any good project management 
practice. Good project managers apply most of the principles, if not all, daily. 
In addition, it is part of our approach to project management to focus on the 
delivery of the initiative. Our teams try to minimize any additional disruption 
to the organization that may compromise the ability to deliver successfully. 
Changing methodologies, especially mid-stream as some organizations have 
been doing, tend to introduce an extra level of complexity and risk to the 
delivery.
Harpham: How do you present agile methods to upper management?

Project Managers at Work
147
Atkins: The sale to upper management largely comes from consulting 
organizations that do not have a good understanding of agile methods and are 
not experts in project management. Unfortunately, the pitch to use agile often 
amounts to “use agile because it’s better, cheaper, and faster.” After all, who 
doesn’t want to execute projects and programs better, faster, and cheaper? In 
that sales pitch, the focus is on successful results and the point that a great 
amount of discipline and new process is required is lost. By “discipline” I mean 
for instance knowing how to effectively manage risks and issues informally 
versus formally as in traditional project management practice.
In more extreme cases, for agile to work effectively, an organization may need 
to restructure entire teams before the new methodology starts to work. 
Take, for instance, DevOps from agile. DevOps suggests that development 
[Dev] and infrastructure [Ops] teams should be broken from their silos and 
morphed into mixed discipline teams, so that code can be developed and 
delivered to production faster. In DevOps, this new mixed development team 
will end up reporting to an individual, which goes against some of the existing 
audit and/or security controls. As a result, audit and security needs to be 
revised so satisfactory checks and balances are in place. All this work ends up 
increasing the complexity of an initiative, causing a great amount of disruption, 
and/or in worst cases, paralyzing the organization, which will compromise the 
organization’s ability to deliver successfully.
In reality, agile comes down to a different way to approach and manage the 
project work, which may or may not be suitable to all corporate cultures or 
project initiatives. Most of the work required to successfully manage an initiative 
using waterfall does not go away and cannot be ignored simply because agile is 
in place. The work will still exist and will be completed formally [planning] or 
informally [risks and issues management], and the informality of key processes 
is where the biggest challenge lies in organizations that opt for agile.
Harpham: Can you elaborate on the impact and significance of legacy 
systems to projects?
Atkins: Legacy systems tend to be large and complicated. They tend to 
require a lot of coding, a lot of testing and crystal clarity on your plans if 
you plan to modify or replace them. Projects involving legacy systems lend 
themselves more to a waterfall methodology at this point. That means going 
through the process of requirements, design, building, testing, and so forth.
We are seeing programs executing in a hybrid fashion. Some work streams 
operating in an agile-like manner with other work streams in the same program 
operate in a traditional waterfall methodology. Early indicators suggest this 
way of working has the potential to deliver a program at a lower cost and 
shorter duration than using traditional waterfall in all work streams. But there 
is little evidence yet to prove this conclusively.

Chapter 12 | Tom Atkins, President, Tramore Group
148
Harpham: What have been some of your lessons learned in working on 
projects and programs?
Atkins: Here’s one mistake I see often: using business analysts who lack the 
appropriate capabilities to lead an exercise in developing requirements. If you 
start with bad requirements, you’re going to have a lot of rework later. In fact, 
there may be so much rework that it sinks the business case.
I remember having a conversation on a large program with the chief operating 
officer of a large financial institution. I said to him, “You have two business 
systems analysts [BSAs] working on this program in the role of a business 
analyst. However, BSAs at your company are conditioned to receive a request 
for a function from the business and look into how it can be developed using 
the existing technology platforms.” In this program, the business unit was 
replacing the “heart” of the business with a new system. It was a situation 
where you start with a blank piece of paper and ask, “How can we do this in 
the most efficient manner? If we could do this program any way we wanted, 
what would we do?” The BSAs didn’t have the necessary freethinking and 
approach to get this work done.
Harpham: How did the situation with the large program play out?
Atkins: I walked the executive through the costs. At first, the COO was 
only thinking about the cost of the BSAs. He pointed out that it only cost 
two months wages of the BSAs to see if they could get the job done and he 
wanted to give them a chance to succeed. However, the COO missed the fact 
that there is an impact to the program regarding delays and rework. The run 
rate resource costs for this project were over $200,000 each month. When I 
laid the costs out in detail, I asked, “Are these the costs that you want to pay 
to use these BSAs in this situation?” His decision was to add new business 
analysts within two days who were better suited to the work. This is the value 
of looking through the right lens with the right data at hand. This COO was 
a very competent executive and evidence-based decision maker. The decision 
was easy with the right data.
Harpham: What activities, questions, and actions characterize a highly 
effective business analyst who is leading requirements development?
Atkins: It starts with making sure that the requirements sessions are properly 
attended—that all appropriate groups and departments are represented. 
Their job is to facilitate the meeting, to extract the requirements from the 
attendees using good process and to document those requirements. Typically, 
you have two or more sessions to define each functional requirement. In the 
second session, you would play back the requirements that you documented 
and ask, “Did we get it right?” Once you receive confirmation on that function, 
you move on to the next function.

Project Managers at Work
149
It’s also important to guide people through an effective process in developing 
requirements. You need to understand how the functions are supposed to 
work and be comfortable in challenging participants to look at the problem 
through different lenses to identify the most effective alternative.
Harpham: A key part of success in requirements is: “Did we invite the 
right people to participate and did we make sure that they showed up and 
participated?”
Atkins: Correct.
Harpham: Let’s shift focus to the consulting world. What is your approach 
to managing your team of consultants at Tramore Group?
Atkins: We start with hiring people that are senior enough that they are 
largely self-managing. We have a rigorous hiring process. It is much more 
rigorous than what I’ve seen anywhere else.
Harpham: Do you see contrasts between hiring at client organizations 
versus your hiring approach in hiring project management talent?
Atkins: Most organizations have hiring managers who don’t know anything 
about project management. For example, the project manager reports to a 
business manager who doesn’t know project management. As a result, the 
business manager “hires in their own image” and gets the wrong person.
Our process is simple. It starts with a proper intake process. We interview 
potential hires almost daily. The interview process has several steps, including 
peer interviews with our working practitioners. If they clear that stage of 
the process, the next step is an interview with one of our senior program 
managers. After that interview, we conduct reference checks, criminal 
background checks and identity checks before we make the decision on 
whether to offer employment.
Harpham: Part of the “secret sauce” is paying above average attention to 
talent.
Atkins: Correct. 
Harpham: How have client needs and demands to the firm changed over 
the past five years?
Atkins: Some of the time we’re brought in, the program is already underway 
and not performing well.
Proactive engagement tends to happen related to large, strategically important 
programs that have executive attention. In those cases, the executive 
understands the value of outside assistance to implementing the program.

Chapter 12 | Tom Atkins, President, Tramore Group
150
Over the years, the success of our consultants in recovering troubled initiatives 
has led to a growing number of engagements where we have consultants 
leading initiatives from early stages, such as “ideation.”
Harpham: In some cases, you’re being called in when there’s a fire?
Atkins: I am not sure if it is “a fire,” but a little less than half of our engagements 
are remediating existing projects.
Harpham: Turning to the senior people in your firm, what strategies do you 
see them use for managing themselves and staying productive?
Atkins: It starts with proper training and coaching. For the team and the 
team leader, we have huddles where senior people who are not involved in 
that engagement sit with the team every few weeks. This provides an outside 
perspective on their work.
Harpham: At an individual level, what do their productivity strategies and 
methods look like?
Atkins: Constant communication is a recurring pattern within the consulting 
team, with the client and so forth. The details and nature of that communication 
work adjusts depending on the nature of the project and the organization 
we’re working for.
Harpham: Looking ahead over the next three to five years, what are some 
trends that may impact the programs you’re involved with?
Atkins: The pace of transformation and change is greater now than ever 
before. The pace of change is increasing quarter to quarter and year to year. 
The need for companies to change and transform is becoming a critical 
aspect of competitive advantage. We’re already having senior executives at 
various organizations asking us for direction on ways to increase the pace of 
transformation while making sure to get it done right.
The biggest single change will be between those organizations that invest 
in transformation and those who are concerned with managing their costs. 
I would guess that those companies that are focused on managing costs at 
the line-item level will fall behind in terms of their competitive position. The 
chasm between these two approaches—the transformation focus and the 
cost management focus—will widen very quickly. This is not to say that cost 
management is not important. It is. There will be a greater focus, however, on 
seeing project and program leaders as value-added advisors—as important 
as strategy consultants and subject matter experts.

during his career with Xerox and other companies. That 
knowledge and experience supported later opportunities.
• 
The expense control mentality: This tendency, suitable 
for regular business operations, tends not to work well in 
programs and on projects.
• 
Project management discipline: Omitting the change 
control process may buy some speed in the short term, 
but it may come at the cost of a negative impact to the 
schedule, scope, and budget.
• 
Steps to develop a program: Estimating the work and 
budget required for a $100 million–program requires 
extensive work. Expect to spend significant resources 
upfront to define the requirements, design, and related 
activities.
• 
The differences between successful project managers 
and program managers: There is a significant difference 
in complexity between these roles. The project manager 
will tend to focus 80% of her time on the project team 
and 20% on the rest of the organization; the emphasis is 
reversed for the program manager who spends 80% of 
his time on the broad stakeholder group and 20% with 
the project team. The project manager is focused on 
the days and weeks ahead while the program manager 
focuses on a longer time horizon such as months and 
quarters.
• 
Choose your business analysts carefully. Choosing 
ineffective or inexperienced analysts to do requirements 
development can cause in significant re-work resulting in 
cost over runs and schedule delays.

Cornelius 
Fichtner
President, OSP International LLC
As president and founder of OSP International LLC, Cornelius Fichtner, PMP 
defines the strategic direction of the company and works with project management 
trainers and coaches to design and develop new products. Fichtner came to proj-
ect management by accident. He started out as a software developer but quickly 
realized that he preferred talking to people to writing code. He moved into what 
was then called “organizational planning” and became certified in the field. It took 
him about three to four years to make the switch and completely leave software 
development—all the while leading increasingly complex and important projects.
Fichtner has been working as a project manager in his native Switzerland, in 
Germany, and in the United States since 1990. He received his Project Management 
Professional (PMP) credential in April 2004. He has led projects for a management 
consulting company, a national retailer, an Internet startup company, and one of 
the oldest financial service providers in the United States. Fichtner also holds the 
Certified Scrum Master (CSM) credential.
Bruce Harpham: What was your first exposure to working on projects?
Cornelius Fichtner: The first project I worked on was at a paper mill in 
Switzerland. I was based in the IT department. I had just come out of school, 
finished a commercial apprenticeship, and started my first job as a software 
developer.

At one point, my boss said, “Hey why don’t you go over to Mr. Smith and 
help him with something small.” Well, I was done with the “something small” 
eighteen months later.
Mr. Smith wanted a program that would calculate the production cost of every 
single type of paper produced by the paper mill.
Harpham: This sounds like creating a management accounting system from 
scratch.
Fichtner: It wasn’t quite that elaborate. The application was meant to 
answer questions like: “How much does it cost to produce an A4 paper at 
this weight?” and many variations on that theme. There were many types of 
paper to be analyzed through this program. I didn’t really know that I was 
doing project management.
As I progressed through my career as a developer, I realized that I was 
basically talking to machines all day. That wasn’t enough for me. Reflecting 
on my experiences traveling abroad for a year, I found that I really enjoyed 
interacting with and meeting new people. Therefore, I decided I needed a new 
job and became a management consultant.
At the time, the work was called “organizational planning.” In reality, I was  
doing project management. More and more, I learned about projects, 
developing project management offices [PMOs] and related efforts. Later on, 
I was involved in a PMO for a supermarket company in Switzerland. The CEO 
was a big supporter of project management because he realized many people 
were involved in projects and did not really know what they were doing.  
The mission was to teach everybody to succeed on their projects, no matter 
how small.
Together with an external consultant, we developed a one-page project 
management methodology. Everything fit onto one page! Based on that 
document, we taught hundreds of people to manage projects. We taught them 
to use this structured approach to plan, execute, and implement their work 
more quickly.
Harpham: What was that process to train people on project management?
Fichtner: I was also involved in teaching people how to use various computer 
software programs. For example, I taught people how to use Harvard 
Graphics—something like a cross between Microsoft Paint and Adobe 
Photoshop—before I got involved in teaching project management.

My approach in teaching project management then was to say:
“Here are the tools that will help you get your work 
done.”
“Here are ways to communicate with upper 
management.”
“Here are ways to schedule your work effectively.”
It was more about giving them tools than teaching project management per se.
Harpham: Simplicity and first principles guided your approach to teaching 
project management?
Fichtner: Yes, that’s right. I continued to use the simplicity concept in other 
organizations.
Years later, I was working in a project management position at a financial 
services company. In that case, the company’s headquarters required us to 
implement a project management methodology across our division. Just for 
kicks, I printed the project management templates that they asked us to use. 
It filled an entire binder! I’m not kidding! Every single project was required to 
fill in these forms.
Harpham: In the project world, some people have the assumption that the 
templates will save us. What did you do when you saw this binder of material?
Fichtner: I knew what I had to do. I went to my boss and said, “Our projects 
are an average of three to six weeks in duration. There’s no way we can do 
these templates. I will develop a methodology for us that is one page long. 
I will take everything from the binder and I will condense it down to one page. 
And in order to help us gain approval from headquarters on this, I will provide 
explanations on our local, internal processes that cover all the templates that 
I’m cutting out.”
In the end, it was a one page document with a few variations to cover different 
types of projects. The longest document was two and a half pages. My vision 
was: “I have to cut this down to one page. Our developers, our business 
analysts, our project managers—they will not fill in these templates. No way.”
We then worked with the bank’s auditors on our new process. We had a list 
of every single template that was required. We explained in detail how we are 
capturing each requirement in other systems and do not need to duplicate the 
information on the template.
Harpham: What was that conversation like with the auditors?
Fichtner: It was no problem because we came prepared. We told them, 
“Look, here is the situation. This is the size of the project. This is the overhead 
that the binder full of forms will create for us.” They agreed with the proposal.

Chapter 13 | Cornelius Fichtner, President, OSP International LLC
156
Harpham: Having worked at a bank, that sounds like a fast approval.
Fichtner: In the short term, it was a successful response to the overwhelming 
process that headquarters requested. Ultimately, I decided to leave the 
organization because they had an overzealous approach to audits. I heard that 
people would lose their jobs over misspellings or other minor problems.
Harpham: Deeper problems were at play then?
Fichtner: Yes, that’s right.
Harpham: What other industries and organizations did you work at next?
Fichtner: After the paper mill, I had a sabbatical. I came back and worked 
for a vacation tour operator in IT. Then, I went to the management consulting 
firm for about four to five years. At the consulting firm, I really learned project 
management without knowing it. That was also the first time that I downloaded 
and read A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge [PMBOK Guide]. 
It was probably version one or two.
Harpham: What was it like to learn about the PMBOK Guide for the first 
time?
Fichtner: Fantastic! I immediately recognized the value of the PMBOK Guide 
as a way to structure projects.
Harpham: What was next for your career?
Fichtner: I went to a web startup company—we made websites for various 
clients. I led website development projects for a few years.
Harpham: It seems like you’ve made a number of industry changes smoothly. 
What was it like to switch from paper mill to financial services, and so forth?
Fichtner: Throughout the various industries, I was in the IT department in 
each case. I wasn’t making paper in the paper mill. I wasn’t advising clients 
on vacation choices. I had a steady focus on IT activities in these various 
industries. Initially, I joined the management consulting firm because they 
wanted a software developer with growth potential.
From that point on, I moved into a consultant and project manager roles. I 
wasn’t focused on the industry—I was looking for an interesting job. From my 
perspective, I never really changed industries. I was always IT focused.
Harpham: Would that mean a focus on web technologies? Or would this be 
database development?
Fichtner: As the years went by, it became more and more web-focused 
work.
Harpham: You found a common thread that you could take through several 
different organizations?

Project Managers at Work
157
Fichtner: Yes. It didn’t matter that I was previously at a paper mill. I knew 
how to build good websites and that was all that mattered.
Harpham: At some point, you moved to the United States. How did that 
come about?
Fichtner: Simple. I married a US citizen. My wife is from California. We got 
married in Arizona and then lived in Switzerland for ten years. We enjoyed it 
very much and then decided it was time for a change. We looked at England, 
Australia, and other places. In the end, it was a fairly simple process to visit the 
US Embassy in Berne and get my green card because we had been married 
for so long.
Harpham: Let’s move to the chapter of your career when you start your own 
company. I believe you had some PMP exam training through a professional 
association.
Fichtner: After we came to the United States, I was with the web development 
company. I decided shortly after arriving in the US that I wanted to leave the 
company. Oddly enough, the company moved me from Switzerland to the 
United States and they laid me off after having me in the US for six weeks.
I realized I had enough savings to keep us going for about a year. I asked myself: 
“What do I need to do to become competitive?” I decided to obtain the 
Project Management Professional [PMP] certification and I joined the Project 
Management Institute [PMI]. I also became heavily involved with PMI. By the 
way, I found my job at the bank through my PMI connections.
Through PMI, I started organizing continuing education seminars for my local 
PMI chapter. After receiving my PMP certification, the PMI chapter asked me if 
I would like to get involved in the chapter’s PMP training group. Two or three 
times per year, I would teach part of the PMP exam course run by the chapter.
Harpham: Did you have a certain area of focus that you taught?
Fichtner: No. I would teach any of the knowledge areas with the exception 
of earned value. That was the only one that proved a challenge. I had never 
used earned value in my work. It was a question of knowing what you’re good 
at, so I focused on other topics.
Harpham: When did you get involved in podcasts?
Fichtner: My wife gave me an iPod in 2004. Suddenly, things started to come 
together. I had always enjoyed teaching. A few years earlier, I had thought 
about looking for a teaching job or one in training. Around the same time, I 
had become PMP certified and I was teaching PMP preparation. I also started 
to listen to podcasts—news, science, comedy, you name it.

Chapter 13 | Cornelius Fichtner, President, OSP International LLC
158
I realized there is a lack of project management information in podcasting.  
I launched The Project Management Podcast in 2005. Training, project manage-
ment and podcasting all started to come together. By mid 2006, I had The PM 
PrepCast, an audio series that would help you prepare for the PMP exam.
Harpham: Did you have your trademark sign-off, “Until next time,” at that time?
Fichtner: Absolutely. That started with the first episode of The Project 
Management Podcast.
Harpham: How did the first paid product come up?
Fichtner: My podcast listeners actually asked me to create products. I created 
the first paid product after running the podcast for about a year. I sold it for 
$29 and then raised the price to $49 and beyond. Also, I got very negative 
feedback from other trainers who stated that I was devaluing the PMP exam.
Harpham: What did you tell them?
Fichtner: I told them, “Do you remember the Industrial Revolution and the 
weaving loom? I am your weaving loom and I’m not going away.”
Harpham: Yet I still see project management training courses in the $1,000 
price range and higher.
Fichtner: Yes, those are still there. Interestingly, I receive feedback from my 
students that say they learned more and passed their PMP exam from my 
course compared to a traditional in-person course. This kind of feedback 
from students makes a big difference. I share these student emails with the 
team to encourage and inspire them.
Harpham: At what point did you bring other staff into the company?
Fichtner: At some point, I realized that I could no longer support our 
customers and do the rest of the work. I knew that I needed a customer 
support representative. It happened within a year of launching our PMP 
training product.
Harpham: For a period of time, you ran the company on a part-time basis?
Fichtner: For the first year or so, everything was run part-time while I was 
working a full-time job at a financial institution. After about a year, I made the 
transition to self-employment.
Harpham: As you have watched project management methodology and 
PMBOK Guide evolve over the years, how do you keep up with it? And do 
these new editions add value?
Fichtner: The PMBOK Guide will never be perfect because it is only a guide 
to what everybody does. Project management evolves—we’ve seen that with 
the rise of agile. The PMBOK Guide will never be done or finished. People come 
up with new ideas and new needs.

Project Managers at Work
159
The ever-evolving art of project management is documented in each new 
edition of the PMBOK Guide.
Harpham: So the world shifts and we adjust with it?
Fichtner: Yes, the PMBOK Guide documents what we are doing in the 
profession and our changing insights. It’s not that the PMBOK Guide tells you 
how to do project management. If you are new to the profession, the PMBOK 
Guide will give you a wonderful overview and understanding of what we 
generally do in projects. In order to deeply understand projects, you have to 
lead projects, make mistakes, and learn from them.
Harpham: Speaking of mistakes, project management has a concept called 
“lessons learned.” Unfortunately, lessons learned are sometimes written or 
discussed in vague or unhelpful ways, such as “mistakes were made” or “the 
project failed due to software problems.”
What’s a mistake you made on a project where you took that lesson learned 
away and applied it afterwards?
Fichtner: It’s more a case of death by a thousand cuts in my case. There’s a 
saying, “How do you recognize a good project manager? It’s the woman or the 
man over there with all the knives stuck in their back.” They’ve failed so many 
times and lived to tell the tale.
Little things that went wrong, rather than huge mistakes, stand out to me. For 
example, poor word choice in a status report that upset someone. I learned 
to choose better words to avoid that. There are many examples like that. 
Thankfully, I did not have an experience like, “Oh no, the bridge crashed! 
We’re in big trouble!”
Harpham: What is your approach to coordinating virtual teams? I understand 
that your staff and contractors are in different locations and countries. How 
do you bring the team together in that case?
Fichtner: We are fully virtual. Everybody works from home. Our staff are 
all over the world—Canada, USA, South America, Israel, the UK, and the 
Philippines.
In the last few years, we have used an agile approach on our projects. We 
have a daily stand-up meeting. IT services and other groups that perform 
operations also use this practice even if they are not running projects. One 
person on each of these calls becomes the responsible team leader to make 
sure that tasks are being completed.
On the project side, we simply bring everybody together daily. We have clear 
agile artifacts: road maps, release plans, the definition of done. Even though 
we have multiple projects underway at the same time, it’s interesting to bring 
together people on different projects. There’s usually some shared insight or 
learning from people commenting on different projects.

Chapter 13 | Cornelius Fichtner, President, OSP International LLC
160
Harpham: With this virtual company, how have you developed your 
leadership philosophy?
Fichtner: I’m still thinking about it. I’ve always been a servant leader. I have 
always tried to serve my customer when I was running projects in a customer 
facing role. Now, I simply see myself as serving the employees and contractors 
on our team.
I read the book The Strategic Project Leader by Jack Ferraro [Auerbach 
Publications, 2014]. It was great. Everything he talks about and writes about 
there aligns with my thinking on leadership. I developed a service-based 
approach to leadership and projects. It’s about helping you to become 
successful—that’s always been my mantra.
Harpham: Getting Things Done by David Allen [Viking, 2001] helped me get 
started with productivity and running projects. It’s one of the few business 
books I’ve read more than once. It has great techniques, like the “two minute 
rule” and “the weekly review.” What are your productivity habits and methods?
Fichtner: I’ve experimented with various productivity systems and approaches 
over the years. Frankly, I’ve found that a pen and pad of paper works best 
for me. The act of writing a to-do list and then cross out completed items is 
satisfying.
Harpham: In 2016, I still see environments where there are project “war 
rooms” where there are sheets of paper on the wall showing project status, 
stakeholder information, software development, and other activities. There’s 
still something valuable about seeing information laid out in paper. Likewise, 
authors Robert Greene and Ryan Holiday both use notecards in their research.
Fichtner: That makes sense.
Harpham: Which resources have made a difference to your thinking and 
your career?
Fichtner: I run a web-based business. Everything that I have learned and done 
for my business has been through digital media. I run a podcast so listening to 
and studying podcasts has been extremely helpful. I can listen to podcasts and 
get business training while I go for a walk.
The number-one podcast that helped me with my Internet business is Internet 
Business Mastery. It explained how web-based businesses work, how to accept 
payments and everything else. Jeremy Frandsen and Jason Van Orden, the hosts 
of the podcast, focus on mindset and understanding yourself. They explore 
questions like, “What do you really want to get out of this business?” and 
“Are you looking for freedom from the nine to five? Or something else?” 
Going through that thought process was good in starting and running my 
business.

I also listen to a few podcasts purely to stay informed on Internet marketing. 
One is called Internet Marketing Insider. The other was Internet Marketing 
Podcast,—that one is no longer being produced, however. Those helped me to 
develop marketing in the Internet world.
The other business podcast that I regularly listen to is HBR Idea Cast. HBR 
[Harvard Business Review] brings on high-level people to discuss important 
business questions, such as “How do you find the right talent for your company?” 
I also listen to TED Talks. I find them to be interesting and applicable because 
they help me to take a broader perspective on my business.
Outside of the above podcasts, there are dozens of other ones that I listen to. 
I like Show Runner on how to run podcasts. Quirks and Quarks from the CBC 
about astronomy and science. There are many others. I listen to an enormous 
array of podcasts on different topics.
Harpham: In addition to the great material, I also find that TED Talks are a 
great resource for public speaking.
Fichtner: I fashioned my presentation at the 2015 PMI Congress in terms of 
my slide design—one picture and a few words—based on the TED Talks style. 
TED Talks are certainly a world class speaking school.
Harpham: For reader who is in another profession who wants to switch 
into project management, what are some first steps to explore a move to 
project management?
Fichtner: Humans have an innate ability to manage projects. Tell a seven-
year-old that he or she is going to have a birthday party and that they have to 
set it up. Without much help, they will start working on it in a haphazard but 
relatively planned way.
By the time you are in your early twenties, you already have a good understand-
ing of project management. If you want to transition to a project management 
job, apply project management to what you’re doing right now. Everything 
you’re currently doing will improve from using project management methods 
and processes.
If your boss gives you a new task, think about it from an initiation perspective. 
Write a small project charter—it could be one page or half a page. Take 
project management best practices and apply it to your tasks even if you are 
doing operations. Learn what makes you more successful and build on that.
Harpham: Looking ahead over the next five years, what trends on the 
horizon will impact the profession and how people practice it?
Fichtner: I’m reminded of the old saying: “What is the stock market going to 
do? It will fluctuate.” It’s very much the same with our profession.

Chapter 13 | Cornelius Fichtner, President, OSP International LLC
162
Ten years ago, nobody would have thought agile would become this popular. 
It’s very difficult to predict the future.
If I had to take a few guesses, here’s what comes to mind: Agile may decline 
somewhat in popularity in the coming years because it has been on the rise 
for several years. Something else may come along and replace it. Agile will be 
integrated with traditional project management. I’m not saying that agile is 
going away, but it will fluctuate in how it is applied.
Benefits management is a hot topic right now. If you look back fifteen years ago, 
people were talking about benefits management and asking similar questions 
then. Now, it’s coming back as an area of focus.
The PMI Talent Triangle has implications for project manager training. The 
Talent Triangle suggests that project managers need skills in three broad 
areas: technical project management, strategic and business management, and 
leadership. This model will shape the courses and training materials we use.
At the same time, there’s a danger. Dr. David Hillson, the risk doctor, pointed 
out to me if PMI wants project managers to take on leadership and strategy, 
who’s going to lead the project and do the work? There may be a risk that 
we’re pulling project managers away from the actual work and pushing them 
into other areas.
There is also a demographic issue: project managers are getting older. Every 
PMI chapter I know asks the question: “How do we engage the younger 
generation in the profession?”

Brennan Dunn
Founder, Double Your Freelancing
Brennan Dunn is the founder of Double Your Freelancing, which helps teach 
freelancers and consultants how to earn more money and work with better clients. 
He’s the creator of Double Your Freelancing Rate, Double Your Freelancing Academy, 
and a number of other courses for consultants. His free pricing course, Charge What 
You’re Worth, has helped thousands of freelancers and consultants. Dunn previously 
founded a project management software company called Planscope and a web 
design agency.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
Brennan Dunn: I started my career working at web design agencies. At a 
certain point, I transitioned my career into freelance web development. At 
this point, I became both the project manager and the specialist [“the doer”] 
delivering the work to the client. About a year into my freelancer career, 
I faced a turning point: scale up the business or start turning away clients. 
Eventually, I built up an agency with eleven employees. At that stage, project 
management became more complex and interesting to manage.
There were multiple concurrent client projects to manage. At the same time, 
we had to carry out sales and marketing activities so that we would have 
projects to work on in the future. In order to sell future projects and plan 
accordingly, I needed to understand approximately when our current projects 
would be completed. Understanding the projects became more difficult as I 
moved into a management role, as opposed to being in the weeds of delivering 
to clients. At this scale, I started to learn much more about how to manage 
projects effectively.

Chapter 14 | Brennan Dunn, Founder, Double Your Freelancing

Harpham: So the transition from individual freelancer to managing an agency 
was a turning point in your project management journey?
Dunn: My overall responsibility was to make our clients happy. I also had to give 
thought to scheduling considerations and client expectations. For example, if I 
committed to a client that we would kick off a new project on December 1st, 
then I had to make sure that the team was available to work on the project 
by that date. In terms of client management, making sure we received timely 
feedback as we worked through the project became an important concern. 
When it was just me and the client, it was relatively simple to get feedback and 
keep moving. In larger projects, that becomes more difficult.
After I exited the agency, I decided to create a project management software 
application called Planscope. I was unhappy with the agency’s internal processes 
to manage projects.
Harpham: There are quite a few project management software applications 
on the market. What was special about Planscope?
Dunn: At the agency, we had a billable hours business model. Tracking work 
hours for each professional and producing invoices was difficult. In many cases, 
the client would get an invoice and have questions about it: “How did the 
work output correlate to the hours billed?”
A key priority for Planscope was to ensure that each time-sheet entry related 
to a project task. For example, let’s say you build an application for a client 
that has a billing feature. With Planscope, you could see the billable hours 
associated with creating that billing feature.
In addition, we kept running into a battle between scope and budget 
remaining. Our projects typically took three to six months to create. Clients 
would request changes or new features once they started to work with a 
prototype. We were happy to add additional scope. However, there was often 
a conflict between adding new scope and having no change to the budget. In 
that scenario, you may end up not getting to the finish line.
To address this challenge, we built a simple reporting system that reported 
project progress versus budget remaining. This reporting mechanism would 
serve as the canary in the coal mine to show the relationship between 
progress on the project and remaining budget. With that insight, we can 
ask what steps we should take to address the situation before the project 
encounters serious trouble.
Harpham: How were change requests addressed in this environment?
Dunn: Our projects typically looked like a customized social media website—
like a Facebook clone for cat enthusiasts. Some clients would have an idea, 
raise funding for it, and then come to us to build the project. Initially, they 
would ask for one product at the beginning of the project. Then a month 
or two into the project, they would start to play with the product and start 
asking for new features or functionality.

Project Managers at Work
165
We practiced an agile development process that had minimal upfront 
estimation and planning. Therefore, we were happy to look at changes as 
they came in. However, clients struggled with decisions on whether to apply 
their budget to their original idea or move budget resources to develop new 
feature ideas. We were doing our job as consultants to educate clients on the 
trade-off decisions they were considering during the project. However, I felt 
that a project management tool would clarify this process even further.
Harpham: Did Planscope provide improvements for client communication?
Dunn: Other features included sending out a daily status update email to 
the client. This update would tell the clients which tasks were worked on 
in a given day, a list of items to be reviewed by the client, and so forth. Prior 
to using Planscope, my agency had to do this kind of reporting by manually 
writing an email.
Harpham: For these large projects where the client had a big idea like a 
Facebook clone, defining scope is challenging. You’ve developed a road-
mapping process to address this situation. What goes into that process?
Dunn: Many agencies do some type of road-mapping process at the early 
stage of a project. Another way of defining road mapping is paid discovery: 
clients pay for assistance in developing their general ideas into a more specific 
concept. It’s a short, small, consulting engagement with the goal of you and the 
client on the same wavelength about the project.
I kept encountering the issue where we struggled to sufficiently understand 
the client and their ideas early on. In particular, it was painful to reassign 
someone from a revenue-generating project and have them sit through a series 
of meetings with a prospective client. From a business standpoint, it wasn’t in 
our interest to operate in that way—putting a lot of staff time into unpaid 
activities, like meeting clients to gather information and prepare proposals.  
I wanted to transform this time into a revenue-generating activity and use it 
to generate something valuable for the client at the same time.
Rather than looking at this activity as the client paying for a project estimate, 
I took a different approach. I would say to the client, “You have an assumption 
regarding a business problem that needs to be solved. You have an idea on 
how that can be solved. Day in and day out, we build solutions that solve 
problems just like this. I propose that we sit with you to define the best way 
to get to the end goal that you have in mind.”
Many new freelancers think their job is to be reactionary: whatever comes 
their way from the client, they should agree and build it. Over time, I’ve 
developed a different attitude. I’ll say to clients, “I’ve been down this path of 
action with other clients and I don’t think that is best way to go for these 
reasons… Here is what I suggest instead.”

Last week, I consulted with a client in the Midwest related to marketing 
automation processes. With a non-disclosure agreement in place, I went 
about learning as much as I could about the business. The questions I covered 
includes: How do they make money today? Who are their customers? What is 
the average lifetime value of a customer? How does the client currently upsell 
or cross-sell? How do they get past customers to come back and buy again?
Many of my clients do not have all of these data points on hand when I first 
ask. In the road-mapping session, we’re achieving several aims. We’re defining 
what the project is going to look like. Further, we want to determine how we 
can use the project as an investment in improving the business.
Rather than saying, “Hire me to code an application for x hours,” the 
conversation changes to “How can we make this project into an investment 
for the business?” That happens when the consultant deeply understands 
the business prior to making any recommendations. After the road-mapping 
session, the client receives a deliverable – a detailed report that defines next 
steps. This report could be brought to another person for implementation, if 
they wish.
For my own business, the price of the road-mapping session roughly 
corresponds to the estimated price of the full project. For a $60,000 project, 
the road-mapping session might be $2,000. When I was running the agency 
and routinely delivering projects in the $250,000 to $500,000 level, the road-
mapping project was typically priced around $5,000.
In addition to the value contained in the road-mapping session and the 
deliverable itself, there are other benefits for client. They have the opportunity 
to work with the consultant for a relatively short period of time and learn 
whether they can work effectively with you. For the consultant, the road-
mapping session often shortens the sales process. If a client is thinking about 
spending $50,000, $100,000, or more with you, and you’re an unknown to 
them, they will tend to take a lot of time to make a decision on a project like 
that. In contrast, if the client has a positive experience on a short project, 
they tend to move faster to the larger project. It’s tough for a client to go 
from spending $0 with you and move to $500,000. For the kinds of clients we 
work with, a $5,000 road-mapping system is effectively an “impulse purchase,” 
especially given the value we deliver.
Here’s an analogy. If you want to go from New York to Los Angeles, you 
wouldn’t simply get in your car and drive west. You need to have a plan and 
know which roads you will take. At the same time, you may adjust your 
approach as you travel, but do you need a plan to get started on the journey.
Harpham: How do you work with clients to determine the ultimate goal 
of the project? For instance, the client may request, “Please build a social 
network website.” How do you determine the underlying goal?

Dunn: It’s important to assess the client. You don’t want to end up with a 
portfolio of projects that didn’t go anywhere, even if you made money on 
each one. You want successful projects that you can point to and use as 
case studies in your marketing. I’ve had clients with a business track record 
move into a completely new and unfamiliar area—like launching an Internet 
business. In those cases, they may have “TechCrunch expectations,” where 
they imagine starting an Internet business is somehow easy.
Helping the client to prioritize their ideas is one way to discover their goal.  
I remember one client who wanted a website with complex community 
features like private messages, moderators, and permissions. However, the 
website had not yet been built and there was no community of users. In the 
road-mapping session, I showed them why these social media style features didn’t 
add much value at this stage of the business. I’ve seen first-hand how difficult 
it can be to build certain types of Internet companies, such as two-sided 
marketplaces that bring together buyers and sellers. Ultimately, the biggest 
risk for the client is a bad goal, like putting all their hope into getting acquired 
by Facebook rather struggling with non-functional software.
However, if they wanted to pursue the “get acquired” goal, then the project 
needs to adjust. A functioning app is not enough. The project also needs to 
include a product that will attract attention from investors. In fact, I’ve helped 
some clients put together pitch decks in order to seek funds from investors. 
After a few rounds of funding and continual improvement to the product, the 
end goal of getting acquired becomes more feasible.
Harpham: Did you think of your business as a technical company or in a 
different way?
Dunn: I didn’t see the agency as an “app development company.” Clients 
typically don’t say, “I want to spend $500,000 to get an app.” Instead, they want 
to pursue a goal like building a new line of business around the app. The more 
we are able to learn what they ultimately want to achieve in the business—the 
end goals, then I can come in with better ideas to help them connect the dots.
The client’s end goal for the project drives the metrics we care about. If 
they’re seeking to get acquired, the important metrics may be how many new 
users are signing up and how much time do they spend on the site? If we’re 
building the project to become a profitable business, then we look at different 
metrics, like conversion rates, customer lifetime value, and so forth.
Our job is to use our technical expertise and skills to define a way for the 
client to achieve their end goal as soon as possible. If the client simply says,  
“I want an app and you’re an app development company—let’s do this project,” 
that is not the kind of project I want to work on.

Harpham: In your work training and consulting with freelancers through 
Double Your Freelancing, what are recurring mistakes you see in how they 
run projects?
Dunn: The biggest misconception consultants and freelancers have concerns 
what they will spend their time doing. For example, a web developer moving 
from a corporate job to an independent consulting career may assume that 
she will get to spend all of her time creating websites—exactly what she loves 
to do all day. In fact, there are many other functions you have to perform. 
You have to do project management tasks, such as managing the client’s 
expectations and change requests, as well as sales and marketing.
I typically see people struggle to define and manage client expectations 
effectively. Many independent consultants may sell a project, but they 
don’t have a defined onboarding process that sets out the next steps. An 
onboarding procedure defines for the client how the project will be done, 
how communication will work, and what is required in terms of feedback. 
If these points are omitted, the client starts to get concerned and may start 
micro-managing the consultant like an errant employee. That’s bad news for 
the consultant because it means unstructured interaction from the client 
and less autonomy in how you do the work. There’s nothing worse than the 
client who expects you to deliver, but then disappears and is unavailable for 
feedback or updates. When the client disappears like that, it’s easy to build 
something that doesn’t meet their needs. That can lead to costly disputes over 
the project.
Most project failures don’t relate to technology or product malfunctions. 
Instead, poor communication causes failure over and over again.
Harpham: What does your onboarding process look like?
Dunn: Day one, I start with the road-mapping session: a small, self-contained 
project to define the problems and goals. This could take three hours or 
longer, depending on the situation. Next, I produce the road-mapping report 
that details the business case for the project and the relevant data points, and 
outlines next steps. Functionally, the road-mapping report doubles as a project 
proposal. When the client accepts the proposal for a larger proposal, I set up 
the foundation for the project.
My current practice is to use Laura Elizabeth’s Client Portal template to act 
as a central repository of project information. It’s a simple web template that 
defines several points for the client. It explains how project communication 
will work. It provides information on my availability for the project. It also 
includes links to the project file in Trello—my project management application, 
the staging website for the project materials, and all the assets involved in 
the project. I make one of those for every client I work with. Creating and 
delivering this resource to the client is a key part of the onboarding procedure.

Project Managers at Work
169
I also define how communications and meetings will work. Rather than ad 
hoc meetings, I schedule a recurring weekly meeting with the client. At that 
meeting, we cover any and all questions related to the project. I also have a 
procedure that defines what to do for urgent requests. Further, I explain how 
I will provide project updates to the client. I don’t let the client assume how 
the project will work. If I make assumptions about their involvement in the 
project, it’s a recipe for disaster.
Harpham: Do you get resistance from clients regarding the onboarding 
process? 
Dunn: I make it clear how I operate. If the client wants a 24/7 “coder for 
hire”—that’s not me. Early in the process, I explain how I work. The process 
of setting expectations starts at the very beginning when I receive an inquiry 
from a potential client. By marketing myself as a consultant and operating 
accordingly, most clients respect my process. They understand that I am 
focused on their business goals and there’s a process to manage the details of 
communication and interaction.
Harpham: The idea is to reduce back-and-forth communication by having a 
single repository for project information for the client?
Dunn: With this approach, it’s a simple reference for clients to use. It’s better 
than resending emails or anything like that.
Harpham: Using templates and standard processes over and over again gives 
you added mental capacity to add value in other ways.
Dunn: Consultants face the challenge of being perceived as high risk by 
the client. That doesn’t mean we’re high risk in terms of failing to create 
working software or whatever you’re building. Instead, the perceived risk is 
that the consultant flakes out, fails to communicate, or otherwise fails to act 
professionally.
If I receive a project inquiry from a potential client, I don’t immediately move 
to schedule a call with them. I send each prospect an intake questionnaire 
first. Only after completing that document will you receive a link to book 
an appointment on my online calendar. After your calendar appointment is 
confirmed, you will receive a PDF file that details the agenda for the meeting.
Instead of the consultant coming to the meeting like a job interview, I set 
the terms for the discussion. It’s a structured twenty-minute discussion. It’s 
well-structured because the agenda and the intake questionnaire have been 
completed ahead of time. If you don’t provide this kind of structure, many 
clients will default to treating the process like a job interview.

Chapter 14 | Brennan Dunn, Founder, Double Your Freelancing
170
The secondary value of using this process is to create confidence with the 
client. This process signals that you’ve done projects before and that you 
are taking a systematic approach. Some consultants and project managers 
struggle with this because they may not think they have “the right” to impose 
a structure. At the end of the day, the client wants to feel like they’re in the 
hands of a professional who is guiding the process.
Harpham: Perceived risk for the client or project sponsor matters. If you 
drive the process according to a clear playbook, it puts the client at ease.
Dunn: Exactly.
Harpham: How did you come to develop these processes and structures?
Dunn: You may have seen websites like Clients From Hell, where freelancers 
moan and complain about clients. For example, reports of a client making an 
absurd request or otherwise treating the freelancer poorly. In many cases, 
much of the fault lies with the consultant. Failing to set expectations, use a 
process, and communicate effectively causes tremendous problems.
Regarding the onboarding procedure, I developed it while I was running my 
agency. There was a clear business need for me to develop a procedure. Here’s 
the problem I encountered. We would sell a project and then assign different 
people to work on it. I noticed that the end result of the project would be 
significantly different because each person had a different approach. I had to 
standardize the process so that projects would be delivered in a consistent 
way. Otherwise, the agency is little more than a loose collection of smart 
people who are not held together with common processes and methods.
Harpham: Did you draw on other resources or people to develop these 
processes?
Dunn: My lawyer was a key source of inspiration in fact. Organizationally, 
a law firm and a web design agency are similar in that both sell professional 
services to clients. He gave some helpful advice regarding the onboarding 
procedure for new clients.
Harpham: What is your approach to effective delegation on a project?
Dunn: At first, our invoices to clients had details like: “Andrew worked ten 
hours on your project this week.” We moved away from the resource-for-hire 
model. Instead of selling hours like that, we adopted a weekly billing process 
[e.g., invoice x dollars for a week of work effort]. That meant that the client 
received the full-time attention of a senior developer, part of a junior developer, 
quality assurance, and project management for a set fee. That approach gave 
me greater flexibility with staff assignments on projects. Internally, I would 
then look at ways to assign tasks that fit with each individual’s expertise and 
experience.

Harpham: Let’s turn to the closing process you use on projects. How do you 
close out the project?
Dunn: There are several aspects to closing. On a weekly basis, I review the 
work delivered in the current week and plan ahead for next week. On a 
monthly basis, I run a retrospective meeting. During that meeting, the focus 
isn’t on the technical content of the project.
Instead, the meeting agenda has three columns for us to address: happy, neutral, 
and sad. Each person on the project—whether on my side or on the client 
side—can add items to each of the three columns. For example, they might 
add a comment about liking the weekly meetings under the happy column. Or 
write a comment about the staging website in the sad column. If someone else 
agrees with one of these comments, they can “+1” to the comment to give it 
more weight.
At the end of the meeting, we analyze the neutral and sad columns for 
improvement opportunities. The idea is to address these issues and prevent 
them from becoming a recurring problem in the future.
At the very end of the project, I hold an offboarding meeting. You don’t want 
to simply hand over the keys to the software or product and say, “Have fun!” 
Instead, we work through post-project issues with the client. For example, do 
they need support or training in hiring a new person to maintain the system? 
During the sales process, I highlight the offboarding phase as part of the value 
we’re delivering. We’re not going to deliver a website or an application and then 
disappear as soon as we turn it on. The offboarding process also sometimes 
functions as a sales opportunity. For example, the client may realize that they 
need additional assistance with user engagement or maintenance.
Finally, I schedule follow-up actions on my calendar. This is a process that I 
learned from my real estate agent who sold me my house. She called me two 
weeks after we moved in to see if everything was going smoothly. A month 
after that, she called again to ask about our feelings with the neighborhood. 
A year later, she called again to congratulate us on our one-year anniversary 
of moving into the house. I adapted this process for our clients. It was a great 
way to make sure that clients feel supported and to generate testimonials and 
case studies to use in our marketing.
My real estate agent knows that people often sell their house after a few years, 
and that people ask their friends for suggestions. By staying in touch, you are 
more likely to be recommended and receive a referral.
Harpham: I’m impressed by your observation and willingness to adapt 
strategies from other professions. Some people do not have that open 
perspective.

Chapter 14 | Brennan Dunn, Founder, Double Your Freelancing
172
Dunn: Whatever your discipline or profession, there are underlying processes. 
So much of success in the field comes down to learning and mastering sales, 
marketing, fulfillment, and customer service. You can learn those skills from 
other people in different professions. You don’t have to restrict yourself to 
learning from peers in your discipline.
Harpham: This follow-up sequence and offboarding is a way to prevent the 
scenario where the project ships and the project team immediately disappears.
Dunn: In that scenario, people feel left in the cold and unsure on what to 
do next. We don’t want dead, offline websites in our portfolio. We want 
successful projects and clients. I realized that when we deliver the project, 
that’s the beginning of the journey for the client. We want to help them to 
succeed in the long term, and that means giving thought to their situation 
beyond the project itself.
Harpham: What does your personal productivity strategy look like?
Dunn: I have a simple stack of software tools. I use Trello for much of my task 
management—business and personal items alike. If I happen to get a new idea 
while I’m on the go, I open the Notes app on my phone to write it down and 
then transfer it into Trello later.
Every Sunday evening, I plan out the coming week. Specifically, I review the 
tasks in Trello and then put those tasks onto my calendar. Everything of 
importance goes on the calendar: exercise time, client projects, working on a 
new product, and so forth. My reliance on the calendar means that I conserve 
my daily allotment of willpower. If you look at your to-do list every time you 
finish a task, and then deliberate on what to do next, that process erodes your 
decision-making ability. In contrast, if you stay focused on the calendar, which 
you planned earlier in the week, it makes the whole process much easier.
Harpham: Any other productivity or task management techniques to share?
Dunn: Years ago, I sometimes had struggles in this area. I solved these issues 
in part by keeping a weekly task list in paper. If I had to rewrite a task multiple 
days in a row because I wasn’t getting it down, it forced me to confront the 
situation. Was that task actually important? If not, perhaps I should simply 
delete it.
Harpham: That rewriting process forces you to reflect on what tasks you 
have on your plate and what is adding value.
Dunn: Exactly. If I postpone a task ten days in a row, the repeated postponement 
tells me that the task may not be valuable.
Harpham: Looking ahead to the future, what are some technology opportunities 
that interest you?

Dunn: For my current work focus with clients, marketing automation is a 
top focus. I’m going a step beyond that to work on personalization and 
segmentation work in marketing. One of my clients has enterprise clients, small 
business clients, and freelancer clients. If a prospect comes across a blog post 
on the client’s website discussing the enterprise service and then clicks over to 
the marketing page, the product information will be tailored to the enterprise 
audience. Likewise, a user that reads a blog post aimed at the freelancer 
audience will be served the freelancer information on the product page.
On my own website, I have this type of customization in place, depending on 
someone’s discipline. If someone reads about freelancing as a web designer, 
the product pages will reflect that fact. If you do work in creating websites, 
web apps, and related areas, this is an important area that will become more 
valuable over time.
Regarding software to use to run a consulting business, task management 
services are popular right now. For the clients I work with right now, they 
don’t want that level of detail. I’ve seen some tools, like ClientFlow, that are 
attempting to solve this problem. Over time, I think we will see more Software-
as-a-Service tools that assist with onboarding and optimize for client success. 
There’s a tension in these products between giving the detailed view needed 
for the project team to execute and presenting a client-friendly overview of 
the project.
Many people are obsessed with finding the latest and greatest project 
management software tool. However, I think people need to step back and 
think, “What’s a better way to manage clients?” Forecasting analytics is another 
interesting area for the future. Prior to exiting Planscope, I did some work on 
this front. The idea is to track your project progress and better understand 
your clients—how long they take to make decisions. Understand the accuracy 
of your estimates, and so forth. For web design agencies, improved forecasting 
and planning based on project data will be valuable.
Harpham: Which books have been valuable in shaping your thinking?
Dunn: A few books come to mind in different areas.
Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great by Esther Derby and Diana 
Larsen [Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2006]. This book gave a great introduction to 
retrospective meetings and it helped tremendously. I used this process within 
the project and with clients. It helps bring the team together and come up 
with concrete tasks to improve the organization.
Selling the Invisible: A Field Guide to Modern Marketing by Harry Beckwith [Texere 
Publishing, 2001] is another excellent book. If you’re selling professional services 
or some other intangible, this is a helpful book.

Chapter 14 | Brennan Dunn, Founder, Double Your Freelancing
174
The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably by Thomas 
Nagle and John Hogan [Routledge, 2010]. Though it is aimed at marketing 
executives in large companies, I found it quite helpful. It is a great overview 
of different pricing methods, such as cost-based pricing, how buyers perceive 
value, and related issues. It’s not for everyone and it’s not written for a 
consulting audience. I got a lot out of this book that helped me to improve 
my business.
Finally, I think there’s a lot of value in reading Plato’s Dialogues. They show how 
to learn about somebody’s beliefs and ideas through a questioning process. 
My background from college is in the classics. I’ve learned a lot from that field.
Chapter Summary
• 
Recommended books include Agile Retrospectives by Esther 
Derby and Diana Larsen, Selling the Invisible by Harry 
Beckwith, The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing by Thomas 
Nagle and John Hogan, and Plato’s Dialogues.
• 
The origin of Dunn’s project management app, Planscope: 
Dunn was inspired to create the Planscope app after 
struggling to find effective tools and methods to run 
projects at his agency.
• 
The proactive consultant mindset: In his work with 
many freelancers and consultants, Dunn has noticed that 
top performers proactively define their relationships 
with clients in terms of communication structure and 
frequency and overall expectations. You can’t assume 
that your client knows the right way to work with you.
• 
Adapt lessons from other professions: Dunn has adopted 
best practices from lawyers and real estate professionals to 
improve his productivity. Look beyond your discipline for 
new strategies and tactics to improve your performance.
• 
The road-mapping strategy. Not sure how to approach a 
vaguely worded client request? Consider Dunn’s process 
to use a road-mapping service to define the goal before 
getting involved in the project’s details.

Director of APM Practice, General Electric
Tracy Ford is the director of the APM Practice of GE Digital’s Global Services 
organization. She manages a global team of engineers that deliver GE’s APM and 
SmartSignal products to customers. Based outside of Chicago, Illinois, her team 
supports customers all over the world with all types of equipment. They are on 
track to triple the number of assets connected year after year. A 25-plus-year GE 
veteran, Ford has worked at various GE companies, including GE Renewables and 
GE Energy. She holds a master’s degree in computer information systems manage-
ment from Union College in Schenectady, New York.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
Tracy Ford: I’ve been with General Electric for twenty-five years. I started in 
GE’s Software Technology program that was based out of our Global Research 
program for new college graduates. I got started by analyzing data packets 
flowing through networks and the traditional, waterfall project management 
methods. Later on, I earned a master’s degree from Union College and took 
on new assignments within GE: system analyst roles, project manager roles, 
financial transaction quality roles, product manager roles, and product quality 
roles.
My current assignment is the Asset Performance Management [APM] practice 
leader in the Chicago area. I work with a global team of over thirty GE 
employees and forty-plus contractors. I have a team in Brazil, a team in the 
Middle East, and other locations. My focus is on the project management and 
implementation of the APM product, a leading offering for GE Digital. I often 
face the challenge of delivering the promises made by the sales team. I have to

be a top-notch project manager to deliver on those requirements. In fact, I’ve 
recently hired a number of project managers to the team to supplement the 
team’s existing engineering strength.
However, you can’t walk in from the street and start working as a project 
manager here. In my view, you need training from an organization like the 
Project Management Institute [PMI] and a lot of PM experience to be 
successful. My day-to-day work involves overseeing sixty-five projects around 
the world and ensuring that we’re meeting the customer’s requirements.
Harpham: What were some of the first projects you worked on?
Ford: I started working on projects as I went through the company’s 
software technology program. I learned about the project life cycle in terms 
of the waterfall model. It was helpful to break projects into discrete parts—
requirements gathering and the subsequent steps. I remember liking the process 
because it was very prescriptive. On the other hand, there’s a problem with 
that approach. The waterfall approach can be quite time-consuming to work 
through. By the time you get to implementation, the customer requirements 
have changed or the technology is obsolete.
In 2001, I started to work on large IT projects at GE as an IT project manager. 
In those projects, much of the programming was done by contractors. At the 
same time, there were tough demands from internal customers to deliver 
the project. In my experience, GE internal customers can be the toughest 
customers because they expect a lot from their GE peers. About a year after 
starting that role, I pursued PMI training. I found PMI’s model helpful especially 
in terms of risk management, understanding the critical path process and 
getting clear on roles and responsibilities. Learning the PMI approach to 
projects gave me a great structure to work on. I had originally worked on IT 
because it is logical work. I like the clarity and the ability to follow a checklist. 
Project management has much of that structure and logic.
Harpham: What was the objective of these early projects?
Ford: One early project was called the “EP configurator.” [The energy products 
configurator was a tool for customers to configure the type of GE product 
needed to solve their energy needs.] This system helped GE end customers 
enter specifications and figure out what type of GE power turbine they should 
get. In essence, this tool was to help the customer understand what type of 
turbine they would need. This system would also provide information to GE’s 
proposals team, which would work on the request with the customer.
I have also worked on full-scale ERP implementation projects. As the acting 
manager for the sourcing group at the GE Global Research Center, I worked 
on an ERP implementation project from the business side.

Looking back, one of the projects I’m most proud of is an ERP implementation 
for an online parts ordering system for GE Renewables. That project was 
extremely challenging. The project had high visibility. This system was directly 
used by the end customer and internal GE groups. It involved making hard 
decisions to meet the deadline. For example, I had to say no to certain 
requirements in order to meet the schedule. The question became “What can 
you get done in the time frame we have?”
I started my career using the waterfall approach to project management. 
Today, I’m a proponent of the agile methodology. If you take a long time to 
implement technology, it’s going to be obsolete by the time you finish. The 
potential for instant feedback in agile is highly attractive.
On my current projects, it’s important to get our customers set up on our 
website as soon as possible. That way, they can see our systems and capabilities 
even if the system had not been fully deployed and configured. At least, they 
can see and touch the system to start to understand it. That way, they can 
give us feedback. The last thing I want to do is spend three to six months 
implementing a project in isolation and have the end customer say, “Oh, this 
system doesn’t do what I wanted it to do.” Obtaining feedback early and often 
from the customer is important.
Harpham: ERP projects are interesting because they can have high impact 
and deliver value to senior management. On the other hand, these projects 
can burn huge amounts of money if they flounder and take years to be fully 
implemented. What has your ERP project experience been like?
Ford: Interestingly, we’re in the middle of another ERP implementation right 
now. Oh, my goodness. At this point, I’m on the business side rather than 
running the project. It’s almost a case where I know too much to be a normal 
stakeholder on the project. We’re moving from SAP to Oracle at the moment.
Turning to the ERP implementation I led, there were a lot of moving parts. 
I negotiated with the project sponsor on expectations. He wanted it to 
be the Big Bang and he wanted every capability in it. In other words, 100% 
functionality and features on Day 1 rather than a gradual release. His view was 
that we’re only going to receive ERP project funds once, so we’ve got to build 
as much as we can. He wanted to delay the end date of the project in order 
to build more scope. I went against that view.
Instead, I argued that it’s more important to launch a simpler system sooner 
rather than delaying and launching a more complete system. An earlier launch 
will give us critical feedback from users on what to do next. Once you get the 
ERP system live, you can transition to a quarterly process to release updates 
and changes. My view was to launch the system with the critical features and 
add more during the quarterly releases. We were trying to do things with 
Oracle iStore that it wasn’t meant to do out of the box. We definitely pushed 
the capability of iStore to the limit.

For example, we were trying to make Oracle eBusiness Suite into a point-and-
click purchasing experience that Amazon provides. When a customer comes 
to make an order, we wanted it be a pretty good user experience. ERP systems 
have a lot of great modular functionality. However, they don’t necessarily come 
with an attractive front-end user interface. We had to strike a balance between 
making modifications to the code and maintaining compatibility with future 
releases of the ERP product. If you make numerous modifications to the ERP and 
the vendor releases a new version, your modifications may stop working and you 
may need to re-do all of the customization work to restore that functionality.
Fortunately, this re-work problem is likely to decline in significance in the 
future. The rise of micro services in the digital world means minimal upkeep 
to maintain compatibility with future services.
I sought feedback from small and large end customers. I wanted the system to 
increase GE’s parts business and make it easy for customers to find the parts 
they needed. Making sure that we understood the persona of the different 
people who would use the service was important. For example, a person in a 
purchasing group would likely make purchases on a regular basis and want to 
just search by part numbers. In contrast, an asset manager may have occasional 
orders only and won’t have the part numbers. To this day, aspects of the 
system are still being used.
Looking back, I did see some areas where there were struggles. I didn’t think 
through and close all of the holes for pictures of products. The lesson: it’s easy 
to get focused on the promise of a shiny new tool and we forget that there 
needs to be a process to update and maintain the system after the project 
team walks away.
Harpham: It’s the classic struggle where the project team hands a product 
off to the operations team to run.
Ford: Exactly. “Who is responsible to maintain this system?” is a key question.
Harpham: What is a project management practice that you learned the hard 
way from a mistake or challenge?
Ford: Delivering projects in large organizations has been difficult in some 
ways. In one project, I was based at GE headquarters in New York State. 
The project had a global impact on GE offices around the world. Therefore,  
I needed GE stakeholders in Europe to participate and buy into the project. In 
practice, I struggled to engage them effectively.
I remember saying, “Hey, we need the European office to test this!” or do 
some other task. Everything on the project was done through conference 
calls: there was little travel for the project due to concerns around expense 
control. In this case, traveling to the European offices would have made a 
positive difference for the project outcome and engagement. We never 
truly got the European team on board with the project. I tried to cajole and 
convince the European team with calls and emails.

Project Managers at Work

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to meet with them face to face. The lack of 
contact made it difficult to communicate the project mission and vision 
effectively. I think they perceived this project as just another project that GE 
headquarters was shoving down their throats. When I faced problems like 
lack of engagement, I would escalate the matter to the Europe management 
team. While the escalation would get the immediate task completed, I got the 
sense that it was done begrudgingly.
My lesson from this experience: push for face-to-face meetings with 
stakeholders whenever possible despite the expense. It’s critical to meet in 
person because you can pick up details that do not come through in other 
ways [e.g., they’re saying yes with words, but signaling no with body language]. 
Even more important, these meetings give you the opportunity to understand 
what’s blocking them from supporting and participating in the project. In a 
face-to-face meeting, I think other teams are more likely to open up about 
their concerns or tell us about risks that might cause the project to fail. For 
example, the team may be short staffed due to a maternity leave and they’re 
upset about the possibility about being asked to take on additional project 
tasks. You are not likely to get this information on a conference call but you 
are likely to get it while networking after face-to-face meetings.
From a timing perspective, you want to gain that understanding and personal 
connection early in the project. In our case, the engagement issues were 
discovered very late in the project, during user acceptance testing, when it is 
hard to adjust the project to meet their specific needs.
Today, I have a rule for my project managers: have at least one face-to-face 
meeting with the customer. This may seem obvious, but we are a digital 
company that is creating cloud based projects, so we could actually complete 
them without ever going to the customer’s site! The project manager and 
lead engineer could visit. That could be at the project kick-off or at the design 
review stage. It’s vital to build the relationship with the customer through that 
process. You will also understand who will own the results of the project at 
the end.
Harpham: What were some of the warning signals you noticed that tipped 
you off that the stakeholder was disengaged?
Ford: I noticed a lack of response or delayed response in answering emails. 
There were test cases that they were supposed to go through: they didn’t get 
them done. Every “ask” had to be escalated. There was so much going on the 
project that I didn’t stop to ask about this situation. I kept thinking, “OK, I’ll 
just continue escalating to get these tasks done.”
I also noticed disengagement in meetings and conference calls. For example, 
I would invite three people from Europe to a call. However, only one person—
or none!—would actually show up. Getting customer data for testing was also 
difficult. Every step in the process could be seen as an early warning or an 
indicator that there was a deeper problem of disengagement.

Chapter 15 | Tracy Ford, Director of APM Practice, General Electric

Finally, a contributing problem was the lack of a single point person to represent 
the European group on the project. If you give a task to multiple people—
even if the task is “attend this project conference call”—everyone assumes 
somebody else will do it. I use the saying, “If it’s everyone’s responsibility, it’s 
nobody’s responsibility.” You need somebody who is “on the hook” to get the 
work done or provide an answer.
Harpham: If a task is assigned to “the technical team,” then it is unclear who 
I contact when there is a problem or if I have a question.
Ford: Yes, that’s right.
Harpham: Let’s turn to mentorship. What is your experience with 
mentorship in your career?
Ford: There are some people in GE that I look to as mentors and I reach 
out to them for advice. At this stage, I’m looking for a sponsor to support my 
goals rather than a mentor. In my view, a sponsor is someone who takes direct 
action to support and advance my goals. In contrast, a mentor tends to play 
the role of a sounding board and helps you to develop ideas. I’ve been in the 
GE Digital unit for under two years and I’m still looking around for who might 
be a good fit as a sponsor.
I have also acted as a mentor to some of the junior people I’ve worked with, 
such as the interns who have worked in the department. While I’m naturally 
drawn to mentoring others, I have a large team of direct reports to manage, so 
it is difficult to make time for this activity. With each role I’ve had, I’ve picked 
up different tactics and strategies from different people I’ve worked with.
From a people perspective, I do wonder about our growth rate. This business 
is growing fast. There are constantly new projects to work on. With our 
extreme growth we are hiring a lot of people and there is limited time for 
onboarding activities. Are we all getting enough time to be mentored or serve 
as a mentor to others? It is definitely a delicate balance between strategic 
growth and mentoring team members!
Harpham: What are some of the insights you’ve learned from mentors over 
the years?
Ford: I recall the following concept: “What would you do if this was your 
money [or your business]?” At one point, I was working on a project where 
we were looking at project software in depth to see how it could improve our 
work. The manager at the time went around the room and asked everyone 
the following question: “What would you do if this was your business?” It’s an 
important point because it shows he wasn’t looking for a yes-man response. 
He wanted to hear what everyone thought about the issue. When he asked 
that point-blank question, most of the team reconsidered the project and 
decided not to do it.

I’ve also learned about the people aspect of business transformation. In 2008, 
I was working on a project to implement a new configuration management 
system for GE’s wind turbines. In order to do that, we had to put barcodes on 
about one hundred components on each wind turbine. That was a challenge 
because it meant asking manufacturing facilities to take on additional work. 
My mindset shifted when a manager said to me, “Tracy, you need to think 
about how you’re going to bring them flowers.” The meaning? From the other 
person’s perspective, how does the planned change benefit them? In this case, 
the benefit for manufacturing staff was reducing defects in the manufacturing 
process. We also made their daily work easier—giving them a scanner rather 
than recording data in a paper booklet. I had to visit the manufacturing facility 
and get to know their process in depth. With that understanding, I could go 
into depth on how I could make life easier for them. The part barcoding and 
scanning project was fully implemented. The manufacturing staff supported 
the successful project implementation.
Harpham: Empathy and thinking through what’s in it for the other person 
is an important point. After all, when you are deep in the project, the value of 
the project will be clear to you and you may assume everyone appreciates the 
project in the same way.
Ford: Yes, that’s right. About seven years ago, I joined Toastmasters because 
communication skills were not my focus when I started my career as an 
engineer. Reading your audience, anticipating their questions, and responding 
smoothly are some of the benefits I gained from working with Toastmasters. 
Your speaking and listening skills have a major impact on your success or 
failure.
Harpham: What has been your approach to learning from your experiences? 
Ford: I generally ask two questions about projects and other activities I work 
on: “What went well?” and “What could I do better next time?” I think you 
can learn to do better from each and every project you work on. In my current 
role, I focus on implementing our projects quickly and find ways to improve 
quality at the same time. We have to be a learning organization in order to 
deliver all of these improvements. I’ve also started running “Breakfast and 
Learn” sessions to accommodate the schedules of our global team members.
In the Breakfast and Learn sessions, we cover details related to how to do 
the APM implementation and automation tools, proper documentation for 
project managers, Predix basics, etc. It’s a combination of project management 
methodologies and Predix/APM technical details.
We’re also looking for ways to improve our knowledge management processes. 
That’s where you get even greater value out of lessons learned efforts. For 
example, I look at our lessons learned and seek to translate that into an 
improvement. Is it a training issue? Or a missing step in a process? There are 
also cases where I simply consider something to be an anomaly that is unlikely 
to happen again.

Chapter 15 | Tracy Ford, Director of APM Practice, General Electric
182
Harpham: You’ve recently hired several project managers for your team. 
What are some of the traits, skills, and other qualities that you look for when 
hiring project managers?
Ford: I want somebody who has an engineering background or a relevant 
industry background. For example, a lot of our projects are in the oil and 
gas industry and in the power industry. Therefore, I want somebody who 
has dealt with projects in those industries. I also expect new hires come in 
with a certification or formal training in project management. That knowledge 
is an important foundation, because then we can immediately get down to 
discussing concepts like the critical path or Gantt charts.
I’m also interested to know how they handle difficult customers or solving 
difficult problems that come up on projects. Alternately, how they would 
approach communicating bad news on a project, such as showing that it will 
be late. I like to ask about those issues to find out what language they use to 
communicate when faced with those issues. I’ve actually had interviewees say, 
“Well, I had a dumb customer on this project who just didn’t get it.” That kind 
of language is offensive! Oh, my goodness! This is not a person I would want 
on my team if they are going to treat people like that.
Project management can be the hardest job in the world. You have to be able 
to improvise solutions. There are no cookie-cutter projects. I got my team 
T-shirts that say: “Implementation Engineer: Because ‘Badass Miracle Worker’ 
Is Not An Official Job Title.” You’ve got to be like MacGyver to get our 
projects completed. When you are connecting many different types of assets 
from many different industries in a wide variety of technology environments, 
it takes a certain “art” to make it all work. There is no one-size-fits-all for 
solutions, but GE Digital gives us the tools and technology to get the job done.
I’m also interested in understanding a candidate’s methodology and methods. 
How do they like to start a project? That gives me an idea about their approach 
to a project and their experience.
Harpham: If a new project arrives on your desk, how do you start the 
project work?
Ford: We use a checklist to get the key information for the project. For 
example, I get in touch with the inquiry to order [i.e., sales] team to ask 
about the proposal, and what the customer expects, and review related 
documentation. I also ask about the customer’s history with GE and their 
expectations. For example, I may be asked to lead a project kick-off meeting 
next week, which causes a scramble to make it happen.
The next steps will involve getting in touch with other stakeholders within 
GE. I may call in the managed service team to get them on board [if we will 
be managing the assets after they are live and collecting data]. I’ll often get in 
touch with the analytics team as well. It’s important to get all of the teams 
aware of the coming project and what is expected.

Recently, I have led the process to use a formal project charter on all of the 
projects we do. It is a great way to get everyone on the same page [literally] 
by boiling a very large proposal document into a simple one- to two-page 
document with scope, assumptions, roles, responsibilities, and high-level 
schedule.
In the first few days I have a project, the goal is to have the process unfold like 
the baton pass in a relay race between the sales team and the project team.  
I start with a standard project plan in Microsoft Project for each project. 
Based on feedback from the sales team, we add and remove items from it.
Harpham: What are some of your productivity habits and methods that you 
use to stay organized and focused?
Ford: Well, my husband and I both work and we have three children at 
home. Pursuing balance is a never-ending task. I start by getting up early in the 
morning. I grew up on a farm, so that gave me the habit to get up early—5am 
every day, even the weekends— and work hard. The habit of getting up early 
and planning my day out before everyone else gets up makes a big difference.
I use Microsoft OneNote to organize my tasks and information. I’m working 
hard to get away from using paper to track information. I may write a few 
quick notes while I’m on the phone, but then I will write up a quick summary 
in OneNote after. With seventy people—a mix of GE staff and contractors—
on my team and sixty-five projects, I can’t keep that all in my head. That way, 
I can easily respond to questions from my manager about projects I run. The 
team has been growing fast. In 2015, we had about a dozen people.
For project management activities, Microsoft Project is my tool of choice. For 
example, I had a request last Saturday to produce a project plan for a project 
in the Middle East. In that case, I went through the process of creating the 
project plan myself. After all, it would be cruel and unusual punishment to ask 
one of my project managers to work on a Saturday. By knowing MS Project 
well, I can also review project plans and discover potential problems. For 
example, not including appropriate dependencies in your project plans can 
impact your ability to see the critical paths on projects.
Harpham: What books have made a positive impact on your career?
Ford: I really like the book 10-10-10: A Life-Transforming Idea, by Suzy Welch 
[Scribner, 2009], for making decisions about priorities. As a mother of three 
with a very demanding work schedule, you need to make priority decisions 
constantly. I can’t attend all seven meetings that might be on my calendar for 
the same time period. The book poses these questions to decide on priorities: 
Is this going to make a difference ten minutes from now, ten months from now, 
or ten years from now? It’s a great process to decide between two options 
or appointments. For example, I may decide to miss a child’s sports game 
[of which there are many each year], but ensure that I attend their concert 
because there’s only one of those each year.

Earlier today, I happened to re-read part of The One Minute Manager by 
Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson [William Morrow, 2003]. It’s a great 
book and I am re-reading it to refresh my memory on the practices.
Harpham: How has your approach to leadership developed over time?
Ford: Early in my career, I had a task-oriented approach: getting the project 
done and asking what the next task is. I didn’t give much attention to 
networking, relationships, and making sure everyone is on board. Today, I’ve 
realized that relationships make a tremendous impact. Without the relationships, 
the work becomes much harder. I’m focusing on getting out to customers, 
co-workers, and team members each quarter to make sure that the relationships 
remain strong with those important people in my role.
Harpham: Looking three to five years into the future, what are some 
opportunities and trends that are interesting to your work?
Ford: The digital transformation is top of mind for me. I have been focused on 
the tactical and engineering aspect of this transformation. I need to get more 
engaged with the adoption for the customer and the outcomes we’re creating. 
My part of GE Digital used to be a separate company called SmartSignal 
[predictive analytics software]. SmartSignal was acquired by GE in 2011 and 
has a great product. The next step is to put the business transformation 
in place through automated quick deployment of the solution. That’s what 
generates real business improvement. We want to shift from running a project 
and sending out alert notices to customers, to delivering real value for the 
customers.
I’m also interested in increasing collaboration with consulting organizations 
and partners, to help GE Digital grow faster. These partnerships will improve 
the value we deliver to our customers faster.

• 
Toastmasters: Ford found Toastmasters to be an excellent 
organization to develop her communication skills.
• 
The Job Interview Question: Ford often asks prospective 
new hires how they would handle a difficult customer 
situation. Candidates who refer to the customer with 
insulting or abusive language prompt red flags!

Annette Lyjak
Senior IT Manager - Technology Project 
Management Office, OMERS
Annette Lyjak began her professional career with American Express. From 
1999 to 2017, she worked on financial systems as a Business Systems Analyst in 
project, program, and risk management. She has spent over 15 years in a variety 
of roles, specializing in the technical delivery of credit card systems and services 
to American Express clients around the world. In 2017, Lyjak moved to OMERS 
(Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System) Administration Corporation as 
Senior IT Manager for the Technology Project Management Office. Lyjak has been 
PMP certified through the Project Management Institute since 2008. She gradu-
ated from York University (in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) in 1998 with an Honours 
Bachelor of Arts in cultural and critical studies. She recently passed the Certified 
Information Security Manager exam through ISACA.
Lyjak is looks for opportunities to improve the overall quality in project delivery. She 
has been highly effective in the areas of new product development and operational 
risk. Another passion is progressing the careers and experiences of women in 
technology and business, where she has served as an active leader in organizational 
programs.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
Annette Lyjak: I always had a knack for project management, even before I 
learned the term for it. Shortly after graduating from university, where I studied 
the cultural and critical studies program in fine arts, I went on a two-month 
trip through Europe with a friend. I planned the entire trip—the schedule and 
16

                          Office, OMERS

all the details. I had a natural tendency to plan activities, which has served me 
well. In total, we went through eleven countries in two months. Some of the 
countries we visited were England, France, Italy, Czech Republic, and Poland. 
My focus in my studies was art and architecture, so I was really excited to see 
all the buildings and art I had studied up close and personal.
I started my career working at Toronto Dominion Bank [TD Bank] as a 
student. Later, I was a full-time employee in the insurance department, where 
I worked on implementing a new insurance system. The project brought me 
on as a new user to test the system. It was my first experience working on a 
technology project and seeing what was involved with that kind of work.
Shortly afterwards, I landed at American Express in a business systems analyst 
job in the technology division. I was planning on doing my MBA in fine arts. 
However, I caught the travel bug from backpacking through Europe—and 
American Express promised a lot of travel. So I chose to obtain my “MBA” 
from American Express “university,” where I have been afforded with the 
opportunity to learn through doing projects, creating solutions, creating 
brand-new departments and methodologies, while getting to see this amazing 
world we live in.
Harpham: When you were first exposed to projects in the stakeholder role, 
what was the nature of the project?
Lyjak: In the TD Bank context, I was going through user acceptance testing as 
one of the end users. We were working on a mainframe computer application 
that did processing related to lending and mortgage insurance premiums.  
I had a number of test cases to work through as a user. Most of the time, 
I was working on insurance administration related to mortgage insurance and 
related insurance products.
Harpham: What was your focus when you joined American Express?
Lyjak: The company introduced a brand-new financial platform. I was the 
business systems analyst for this platform. I got to learn the SDLC [systems 
development life cycle] framework, the different systems at the company, and 
how to implement a new system from beginning to end. I learned how to discover 
requirements and translate those into test cases. I actually wasn’t fond of writing 
test cases and that’s one of the reasons I moved to project management. In a 
way, I was operating in an agile manner about twenty years ago.
At that time, my approach to agile meant that small project teams were 
assigned. Everyone pitched in to help each other to get work done—including 
writing requirements, developing test cases and plans, and setting up the 
environment. However, I left the coding to the coders. They’re the experts. 
We worked very closely together with them implementing changes and me 
trying to break their code. I ended up moving toward a traditional or waterfall 
project management approach to cope with the increasing complexity I faced 
on the projects.

Project Managers at Work
189
Harpham: That’s an interesting transition. I typically hear of organizations 
starting from a traditional waterfall approach and then moving to agile later 
on. Can you explain that situation further?
Lyjak: Back then, the developers, the project manager, and the analysts 
supported the software project implementation and the ongoing support. We 
didn’t hand it over to somebody else to maintain. Production support was 
integrated with our unit.
Harpham: The general enthusiasm for agile needs to be nuanced depending 
on the industry. In the financial services industry, risk management is a 
paramount concern. You can’t tell a bank customer that their bank account is 
offline for a day because a system update failed. If an email service goes down 
for a day, it would be frustrating, but not to the same degree.
Lyjak: Absolutely, risk is a top consideration in the financial industry. It guides 
much of our approach on projects.
Harpham: What was challenging about test cases and related activities that 
prompted you to change your focus?
Lyjak: Playing to your strengths was a popular concept at that time in the 
business world. Books like Now, Discover Your Strengths by Marcus Buckingham 
and Donald Clifton [Gallup Press, 2001], promoted this viewpoint. I thought 
about my strengths in the professional world. While I considered myself 
effective at test cases and related activities, I didn’t love it. In contrast, I felt I 
was a natural leader. I liked to organize people to achieve a goal, so I decided 
to explore that strength by transitioning to project management.
An opportunity came up during this time to serve as a relationship manager 
for the Canadian division of American Express. The role involved managing 
projects end to end from a funding standpoint. I was accountable for all projects 
within a given portfolio/business line and ensuring that all these projects were 
delivered in a timely manner with quality results. In a way, I skipped a level. 
I went from a lead analyst role to a program management role. My leader at 
the time took a risk in promoting me to the role. He realized that I was a 
people person and had leadership potential. My business analyst background 
meant that I knew how to come up with requirements and then my leadership 
ability would support me through subsequent steps of the process.
My relationship manager role involved end-to-end project delivery, working 
with technology teams and translating everyone’s needs into requirements. 
For smaller projects, I served in the project manager role myself. For example, 
smaller projects would include updating web copy and limited functions were 
required to install partner gateways. That was how I gained much of my project 
management experience. At this point, I thought it would be helpful to pursue 
the PMP certification.

Harpham: Let’s say there are ten projects on the list at different levels of 
complexity. You would assign eight of them to other project managers in 
the organization. You would then manage the two remaining smaller projects 
yourself?
Lyjak: Yes, that’s right.
Harpham: In this program management role, did you play a role in influencing 
or deciding which projects would get funded? It’s common for organizations 
to have more project requests than they have funding.
Lyjak: I had monthly meetings with the executive stakeholders to review their 
portfolio of projects. On an annual basis, I participated in the project selection 
process. There might be fifty project proposals on table to be reviewed. All 
of these required high-level estimates from the technical teams so that we 
could make good decisions about them. Using a cost and benefit analysis, we 
generally chose the projects with the greatest positive impact.
Harpham: In executing these projects, how often did the initial cost and 
benefit estimates turn out to be inaccurate at the end of the project?
Lyjak: Fortunately, that didn’t happen. You can detect if a project is going 
off the rails early in terms of costs and benefits. That’s why running smaller 
versions of the project concept as a pilot is a common approach to mitigate 
the risk of failure. If the project is in danger of blowing past its budget, it may 
be shut down.
Harpham: Scrapping a project is interesting because it appears to be 
somewhat rare. Many people are afflicted by the sunk cost fallacy in making 
project decisions, including deciding whether or not to continue the project. 
Have you seen many projects cancelled?
Lyjak: I have seen a few projects get cancelled. They usually don’t get to the 
stage where you have spent an exorbitant amount of money. From a technical 
standpoint, you may discover that the project will be very difficult to deploy. 
In that case, it may not be worth pursuing. In other cases, a project may be 
cancelled if other priorities with a higher value come up.
Harpham: What are some of your personal lessons learned in project 
management that you learned the hard way?
Lyjak: There’s so many! When I became involved in projects in the operational 
risk area, a wise executive told me, “You can never under communicate.” It’s 
true! I found that when I do not provide timely updates with meaningful 
information, I have run into problems. In those cases, other people may 
escalate to your manager because something isn’t getting done. Poorly written 
updates frustrate stakeholders.

Project Managers at Work
191
When a project goes quiet, that worries me. It’s a sign that something is 
wrong. They may be in over their heads. When I see situations like that, I 
dive in to find out what’s happening and help the project team improve their 
communication.
Harpham: What goes into an effective project status update?
Lyjak: Status updates need to be calibrated to the importance of the project. 
With a low-risk project, there’s more flexibility on how status updates are 
done. Such updates tend to have less detail because there’s no benefit to 
creating detail if the project is small or low risk.
For a high-profile project, I have different expectations for the status update 
process. For example, I want to see details on risk tracking, milestones, and 
further details. If the project concerns an urgent fix to a production system—
something that impacts how our credit cards work for the customer, we may 
have daily status updates to the stakeholders. In addition, the status update 
may be delivered as a live conference call as opposed to an email.
Status updates need to be customized depending on the type of project you’re 
running. You take several factors into account when you decide on the depth 
and frequency of status reporting, including project budget, complexity, and 
customer impact.
Harpham: The recurring cadence is an important part of the process. For 
example, let’s say you had a relatively quiet week where you made incremental 
progress on various tasks but nothing was delivered. You don’t want to go 
silent for a week.
Lyjak: Right, you never want to go “dark” on a project.
Harpham: If project communication to stakeholders stops, panic and 
uncertainty may increase.
Lyjak: It’s easy to get into a bad habit of not communicating. One week 
without project communication may be fine. However, that process may 
easily continue. If the project continues to be silent, you may start to receive 
inquiries that could have been prevented.
Harpham: Let’s turn to the product implementation projects you’ve worked 
on at American Express. You worked on implementing pre-paid mall cards. 
Can you give us an overview of the product and your role?
Lyjak: This product is a gift card. For example, you would buy a $50 American 
Express prepaid card and give it as a present. The recipient can then use it 
to make a purchase. When I was implementing the product several years ago, 
it was a rapid expansion across the United States. The product has grown 
rapidly over the years and now is available in several countries.

For a year, I took on a cross-training assignment with the new cards 
development department. It was an easy transition for me to succeed in this 
department because I had extensive project management expertise to draw 
on. At the same time, there was plenty to learn regarding how new products 
are brought to market. For example, I worked with public affairs, translation, 
and legal as stakeholders in this project. It was also interesting to work with 
companies and stakeholders outside of the company, like banks and retailers. 
In most technology projects, the focus is on internal stakeholders. I crafted 
and created product overviews, which tapped into my creative literary side.
Harpham: How did you adjust to working on a project that has a direct 
impact on the end customer?
Lyjak: I started by researching the product and how it worked. If a customer 
bought this product, how would they use it? I approached the challenge by 
reading up on it and asking questions from people with past experience on 
similar products and projects.
Harpham: What did you find most challenging personally on this project, 
given that it was different from your past projects?
Lyjak: It was a different world for me. I had to learn about the different 
dependencies and connections between systems and people that were 
involved. The work was an end-to-end process—from product concept, 
technology required, marketing material, legal, sales, customer support, and 
so forth. For example, I worked on the copy involved on the product. I also 
interacted with the art department, which created the look and feel of the 
product. The product was customized in appearance based on the co-branded 
relationships we had arranged with various retailers. It was fun to work on 
that because it was tangible. You could see the card and hold it in your hands.
Harpham: What do you mean that this was a cross-training assignment?
Lyjak: On a previous project, I worked on the Travelers Cheques product. 
Through the work, I got to know the VP of that group. He encouraged me 
to work with his organization. We worked out an arrangement to “loan” me 
from my home department and go work in this other department. It was 
a win because gave me an added opportunity to see how the business and 
product development operates. Prior to this role, I was entirely focused on 
the technology group at American Express.
Harpham: I’ve heard this kind of arrangement described as a “secondment”—
being loaned temporarily to another department.
Lyjak: Yes, that’s a way to describe it.
Harpham: It sounds like your connection with an executive played an 
essential role in landing this opportunity. What was the relationship?

Project Managers at Work
193
Lyjak: The person was a key project sponsor and I had only worked with him 
for a short time. During that time, we developed a good working relationship. 
He liked my work and how I resourced my team to ensure that their skills sets 
matched to the project goals.
Harpham: This suggests the importance of always delivering to a high 
standard on projects. If you make a good impression on someone, there are 
benefits to your career that go beyond the project.
Lyjak: You never know what opportunities will be available to you. That’s why 
you need to put your best foot forward.
Harpham: Turning to risk management, this concept has a dual meaning in 
your environment. There’s project risk on the one hand, and risk in the financial 
industry sense on the other hand. What’s your approach to risk management?
Lyjak: I have seen an evolution in how people think and interact with risk. 
Years ago, people would just shut down when they heard the word “risk.” 
There was little understanding that risk can also be seen as an opportunity. 
I learned two important principles about risk. First, that each individual risk 
needs to be assigned to an owner. Second, risk is also an incentive to encourage 
us to find creative solutions.
Harpham: What is an example of a creative solution that you developed in 
response to a risk?
Lyjak: There are different ways risk can impact a project. For example, risk 
may impact the project schedule, the budget, and scope. These risks can be 
independent or appear in combination. Identifying the risk is only the first step 
in the process. The second step is to look for a mitigating control or strategy 
that addresses it. For example, you may decide to crash the schedule or add 
more resources to the project in order to achieve the goal.
When you raise a risk to management, you should have a solution in mind. If 
cost is a concern—that is a common issue—then I will work with the project 
team to explore ways in which we can reduce costs by leveraging activities, 
like piggybacking on an active test environment—looking to other technology 
solutions that still meet the basic needs without all the bells and whistles. I find 
that leaders appreciate individuals who help get things done effectively and 
efficiently. I recommend trying to anticipate the needs of your stakeholders, 
verify those needs, gain agreement, prioritize them, and plan accordingly.
Harpham: Waving a yellow flag on the project to proclaim, “We have a 
problem,” and leaving it at that, doesn’t lead to a good result.
Lyjak: It doesn’t work well. A lot of people look at risk management as a way 
to push accountability to somebody else. If you truly want to transfer risk, pay 
an insurance company for the privilege. As a project manager and a decent 
human being, you can’t simply raise an issue and throw it over the wall.

Chapter 16 | Annette Lyjak, Senior IT Manager - Technology Project Management  
                          Office, OMERS
194
Harpham: The point you make about insurance companies is a good one. 
When you buy insurance, you are making the risk their problem. On the other 
hand, you don’t get that benefit for free. In the project context, some think 
that it is enough to identify a risk as opposed to developing a solution.
Lyjak: It helps to think about other options. For example, if you need another 
department to act on a risk or dependency and they are not acting on it—
maybe they are too busy to take a call with you, then ask yourself, “Is there 
other work we can do to move the project ahead while we wait?”
Harpham: Project management tends to foster a linear thought process—
complete A, then B, and move on to C. It’s a powerful way to move a project 
forward. In other situations, a lateral thinking approach is needed to solve risk 
issues. What’s your approach to developing and using creative approaches?
Lyjak: It starts with talking with a variety of people. That gives you new data 
and perspectives on the problem. It’s also important to look for schedule 
flexibility: Could we do a future task today to maintain progress while 
something else is delayed?
Flexibility is encouraged by practices such as the daily scrum meeting from 
agile. I don’t think there’s a secret sauce to having creative solutions. It comes 
down to being well informed on the project and well connected with different 
people on the project. I stay informed about the project by having regular 
status updates—usually a weekly status to get a cursory perspective—and 
will be involved at project-level status when required. I tend to deep-dive on 
projects when they are risky. Risk can be based on the total cost of the project, 
experience of the project team, and conversely, our stakeholders, scope, and 
the time required to implement.
Harpham: It is also a question of looking for proactive opportunities to do 
some other work. You wouldn’t want a project team to sit idle for a week 
because of a delay by somebody else.
Lyjak: Yes, that’s right.
Harpham: Risk management has recently become an area of focus for 
you. When you see other project managers in action, what are some of the 
common risk mistakes that you see?
Lyjak: The most common issue is failing to escalate a risk for action in a timely 
manner. I think that people are often afraid to point out a risk because they 
think this will make them look bad. I take a different perspective. It’s positive 
and valuable to bring a risk into the open. Otherwise, it will be much more 
difficult to succeed. There are sometimes weaknesses in risk management 
during the planning phase.

A lot of assumptions can be made during the definition phase. Sometimes these 
assumptions are not accounted for, which can lead to issues. This is especially 
true for assuming another team is going to do the work because they have 
always done the work before. This is an assumption. You need to verify with 
the team that they will take on this activity for your project. Otherwise, you 
could be surprised that the team has recently been reorganized and that 
activity/function is no longer supported or hasn’t been transferred to a new 
team to support. The earlier you identify a threat to the project and bring 
that to your leader, the better. The next step is to work with your leader to 
develop a resolution to the risk. Your leaders and stakeholders need to be 
briefed on the project’s risks if you are going to be successful.
Harpham: There’s a “shoot the messenger” anxiety for people bringing risks 
to light?
Lyjak: That’s right.
Harpham: If a peer were to ask for your advice on how to bring up and 
manage a risk issue, what would you suggest?
Lyjak: I would suggest starting by gathering the facts so that we understand 
the risk. Which people are involved internally and beyond on this risk? Only 
once we understand the scope and nature of the risk can we start to look at 
partnering to develop a solution.
Harpham: The risk may initially be presented as a vague intuition. However, 
you cannot escalate a risk based on that feeling alone. Further investigation 
is required to define the risk before you present to an executive or another 
person.
Lyjak: That’s right. Someone I work with recently brought me a risk item where 
a regulatory obligation needed to be met with limited time. Sometimes we 
cannot control when a new regulation is issued. There was some information 
but not all the homework was done on it in terms of the requirements and 
complexity of the solution. I asked them to do further research on the risk 
before we did anything further on it. If I was going to take the issue to a 
senior leader to escalate, I knew I needed to be well prepared in order to do 
that. Alternately, of course, I’d love to avoid escalating the issue and solve it 
directly by coming up with different options. However, some risks are beyond 
our control, so you really need to leverage your leaders’ and their leaders’ 
support.
Harpham: How has your approach to leadership developed?
Lyjak: It starts with going beyond administration in terms of how I think 
about my responsibilities. I bring strong technical experience and credibility to 
my role as a leader regarding working on systems and implementing systems. 
I’ve always appreciated a leader that has my back. That means a leader that 
gives you freedom in your decision making, and based on your performance 
trusts your decision-makings skills to back you up.

Chapter 16 | Annette Lyjak, Senior IT Manager - Technology Project Management  
                          Office, OMERS
196
This leadership approach is something that I try to do for my team. I think 
people appreciate a leader who will go to bat for them and protect them to 
a degree.
As a leader, I also give thought to the career development of people working 
for me. If I know somebody is interested in taking their career in a different 
direction, I look for those opportunities for them to grow.
A colleague came to me when I was helping to develop a new technology 
risk organization. I shared with her what we were trying to accomplish with 
this new organization and she seemed really interested. I was still working 
on what the organization would like, so it was early days. I worked out an 
arrangement with her leader to loan her out to me. I eventually hired her for 
a permanent role. And after a couple of years in the role, she was promoted. 
She couldn’t have come at a better time. She helped me get the department 
off the ground and she excelled in her new role. We both took risks on each 
other and it paid off. It’s also important for me to be accessible to my team 
as a leader, including having one-on-one meetings on a regular basis.
Harpham: What are some of the insights that you’ve learned from mentors?
Lyjak: The “you can never under-communicate” principle was an important 
lesson. Using that principle won me respect from my peers and leaders over 
time. It’s about putting forward an appropriate, short, timely, and meaningful 
message for your audience.
Harpham: What does your personal productivity system look like?
Lyjak: In terms of tools, I use Microsoft PowerPoint constantly. Business 
stakeholders like to be briefed through such presentations. It’s helpful to 
present diagrams and other visuals to explain the technical projects that I’m 
leading. Sending a Microsoft Project plan file to an executive, in contrast, is 
probably not going to be received well. I use that for my own work and 
organization instead. For day-to-day work, SharePoint is a great product to 
coordinate and share files within the team.
Microsoft Excel is the unsung hero of professional work. Excel is simply great! 
I recommend project managers and others use Excel to manage data and stay 
organized. It’s also a great tool for organizing and analyzing financial data.
Conference calls and virtual meeting software are helpful to work through 
issues on projects. I like to use more conference calls, stand-up meetings, and 
similar approaches on high-risk projects to ensure everything keeps moving 
along well.
Harpham: What books have been influential for your career?
Lyjak: Several years ago, I took a development course from a management 
consulting company called Above & Beyond. Tracey Levison—one of the 
course leaders—recommended the book The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron 

Project Managers at Work
197
[J.P. Tarcher/Putnam, 2002]. My undergrad is fine arts, cultural, and critical 
studies. On the surface, that subject matter appears to be very different than 
what my career entails.
The book really helped me to further influence my spiritual path to higher 
creativity. Creativity is fluid and it’s up to you how you tap into your creative 
spirit in your day-to-day life. I may not create the next Guernica by Picasso 
or Fallingwater by Frank Lloyd Wright—who I did my undergraduate thesis 
on. My livelihood is in deploying technology solutions. There are so many 
opportunities for me to be creative in the architecture of a solution, the 
strategy in which I choose to deploy a project, how I communicate and 
present information, etc. If you are struggling with your work and finding it 
mundane, I highly recommend The Artist’s Way to help you tap into your 
creative potential and make the most of your situation—and/or find your path.
Harpham: Which technologies and business trends have your attention and 
interest over the next few years?
Lyjak: Big data analytics is top of mind for me right now. The potential to 
generate new and better insights through data has been helpful in my current 
work in operational risk. There’s been a lot of hype and promotion about big 
data, however, I think this technology will mature and offer greater value over 
time. Related to big data is the need to capture and manage data effectively. 
Otherwise, there is no material for the analysis. In my work, I have used big 
data to identify potential risk areas.

Bob Tarne
Engagement Manager, IBM
Bob Tarne, PMP, CSM, PMI-ACP, is an engagement manager for the IBM Systems 
Group, where he specializes in leading business process improvement initiatives 
following lean/agile project management techniques. Prior to joining IBM, he was 
a managing consultant at PM Solutions, where he was responsible for improving 
clients’ project management practices. He has also worked as a project manager 
for Sprint and Owens-Illinois.
Tarne’s career began in the US Navy, where he served as a cryptologist for seven 
years. He is an IBM-certified executive project manager and agile thought leader, a 
PMI Certified Agile Practitioner (PMI-ACP), a PMP-certified project manager, and a 
Certified ScrumMaster (CSM).
Tarne holds a BS in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois and an MS 
in business from Johns Hopkins University’s Carey Business School. He has been an 
active PMI volunteer since 2000, which includes roles as the chair of the PMI IT & 
Telecom Specific Interest Group and a founding member of the Agile Community of 
Practice.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
Bob Tarne: My first career out of college was in the US Navy. Initially, I was 
in operational roles in the intelligence field. As an example, I lead a team of 
analysts that monitored communications from around the world as part of a 
24/7 operations watch center. Since my undergraduate field was in engineering, 
I had the opportunity to go into a group that did engineering-focused work. 
I worked with the National Security Agency in a group that put electronics

on spy planes. My department worked closely with a number of government 
contractors that performed the work while we provided oversight. Once a 
system was completed, we also monitored how it performed in the field. 
I started picking up the techniques of project management while in this role.
At the same time, I was going to graduate school at Johns Hopkins University, 
working on a master’s degree in business. I took a few project management 
courses during my studies for that degree. In fact, one of my instructors liked 
my final project so much that she kept it as a sample for future classes on 
how to do the assignment. I thought that was a sign that perhaps project 
management was meant for me.
Harpham: What was this prize-winning assignment?
Tarne: It was a common assignment for a project management course. I had 
to come up with a hypothetical project plan to execute a project. I remember 
that I couldn’t do anything directly related to my work because it was classified. 
My hypothetical project was a deployment of cable television to a rural area 
using wireless technology.
Harpham: How did you navigate the transition from the US Navy to the 
civilian world?
Tarne: My graduate school experience helped in the transition—it was a 
practical program where I was working on projects with other people in 
various industries. I also worked with a recruiter who specialized in placing 
military officers into civilian roles. I had good advice and support on how to 
make the transition effectively. My first civilian role was a project manager 
in the IT department of a manufacturing company. I was responsible for all 
software projects supporting the sales and marketing department. One of 
my big projects was an in-house sales-force automation application. This was 
before the days of cloud computing and applications, such as SalesForce.com.
Harpham: Why did you decide to exit the US Navy and move on to other 
activities?
Tarne: I was at a point in my Navy career where I was at a field station in the 
United States. In order to follow the ideal career path, my next position would 
be on a ship. That would mean long periods of time away from home. My wife 
and I had just had our second child. It seemed like a good time to transition 
and jump into the civilian world.
Harpham: What is a project management lesson you learned the hard way?
Tarne: I had a project a few years ago that comes to mind. I was using an 
agile methodology, but one of the executive sponsors was not that big on 
agile. They hadn’t seen success with agile and they didn’t know if it would 
work. In practice, this meant they acted as a micro-manager on the project. 
I was in the position where I was being told what to do, how to run the 

Project Managers at Work
201
project and do things that were against the principles of agile. I recall one of 
the daily stand-up meetings. Typically, a stand-up meeting lasts fifteen minutes. 
In this case, a senior manager came in and asked detailed questions of every 
team member. The meeting lasted an hour. All the details had been captured 
in our agile project management tool, but this manager still asked for verbal 
updates and used up a lot of valuable time. As another example, management 
required people to work sixty hours per week on the project rather than at a 
sustainable pace that agile principles recommend. Over half the people on the 
project left the company during or soon after the project ended.
Harpham: What was driving the requirement for the long hours?
Tarne: The project was getting behind schedule. There was more work to 
do than what the team could get done. The customer had a firm deadline for 
the project. That translated into long hours. Bottom line, I wasn’t firm enough 
in my commitment to agile project management methodology. I should have 
told them that extra hours or adding more people to the project wouldn’t 
solve the problem of too much scope. I ought to have told the client that we 
need to do less scope or that we need more time. Putting more people on the 
project was not going to solve the problem.
I didn’t stand up to the client. Lo and behold, the project got into trouble 
and ended up being late anyway. In hindsight, if the project was going to be 
behind schedule in any case, I should have stood up and said that we can do 
this better.
Harpham: There’s a mental model at play with the sponsor: “If I add X 
number of people to this project, that will solve the problem.”
Tarne: Yes, that was the mindset in this case. If I believe in the methodology, 
I need to convince my management that using the methodology is the right 
way to go.
Harpham: In this case, adopting “the customer is always right” attitude 
would not have been helpful.
Tarne: In the end, the customer didn’t get what they wanted from the project. 
There’s a difference between the customer being right about their end goal 
and being right on the best way to achieve the goal.
Harpham: If we look at the Project Management Institute literature, achieving 
customer satisfaction is a high priority. However, we need to recognize that 
the project manager is bringing certain expertise and professional judgment 
to the table. That may involve pushing back on the customer from time to 
time.
Tarne: That’s a fair point.
Harpham: What stands out to you as a challenging project that you’ve led 
during your time at IBM?

Chapter 17 | Bob Tarne, Engagement Manager, IBM
202
Tarne: I’ve done a number of projects that been quite interesting in their 
own way. It’s important to choose the right people for the project and avoid 
the problem of having too many cooks in the kitchen. Studies have shown the 
ideal team size is less than ten people. On one of my projects, we started with 
a good-sized team, but as the customer asked for more features we added 
people rather than extending the timeline. In addition, I like when project 
teams agree to focus and avoid working until ten p.m. every day.
Last year, I was leading a project to bring the Business Process Management 
technology to a customer in the financial industry. In addition to running the 
project, I got to teach the customer our approach and methodology. It was 
fulfilling to do that coaching and mentoring work.
Harpham: What does coaching and mentoring look like for you?
Tarne: In agile, coaching is a best practice. The first step is basic training 
on agile. Usually, I start off by sitting down with the project manager on the 
customer side. I educate them on the steps and process, such as defining what 
a retrospective is and how to run a retrospective session. I will get to the 
point where I put them in the position to run the activity while I sit in the 
background. Then, I give them feedback on how they did. I point out what they 
did well, suggest what they could differently and points to reflect on. One of 
the biggest challenges I see when an experienced project manager first starts 
to practice agile is the need to think they still have to control everything. In 
agile, if you picked the right people for your team, you need to give them the 
freedom to figure out how to solve the problem and only step in when they 
run into a roadblock.
Harpham: What would the relationship be between you and the customer 
project manager?
Tarne: Usually, they are on a peer level. I generally come in with the IBM team 
to work on a project. There is a customer team that we work with in order to 
deliver the project. The customer team has a project manager and that person 
is a peer. We’re jointly responsible for delivering the project.
Harpham: Interesting that you mentioned joint responsibility. I find that 
when a task is assigned to two people, it is ambiguous who is expected to do 
what. How do you manage that?
Tarne: At the beginning of the project, I sit down with my peer project 
manager and make sure we have clear expectations for who is responsible 
for what. That tends to be prevent the “oh, I thought you were doing this” 
situation.
Harpham: Do you find that people tend to engage well with that process?

Project Managers at Work
203
Tarne: Sometimes there is some resistance to the process. Sometimes that 
resistance is due to the fact that they don’t know what their responsibilities 
will be. The stakeholder may have more on their plate than they expected to 
have. If a person is truly overloaded, then it becomes a discussion with the 
person’s manager to understand what changes can be made.
Harpham: When it comes to new technologies, I sometimes find that 
developers may ask if the project manager is technically credible. How do 
you bring new technology to the table where there may be few or no subject 
matter experts on the client side?
Tarne: At the beginning of the project, it’s common that the client does 
not have the expertise. I bring my team into the effort because we bring the 
expertise and deep knowledge of the technology we are working with. In 
many of our engagements, knowledge transfer and training is a big part of 
our work to help the client understand the technology. In some cases, the 
client will bring in people who want to gain specialized experience with the 
technology being introduced.
In other cases, I have come to the end of the project and the client has not 
prepared to take over ongoing responsibility for the project. In those cases, 
the customer had to issue a change request to keep us around longer while 
they found an internal person to get up to speed.
Harpham: Perhaps they get used to having you around and forget that you 
will eventually leave and work on a different client.
Tarne: Sometimes these transition issues are overlooked or the client has 
difficulty finding someone to take it in. It’s not good but it does happen from 
time to time.
Harpham: Let’s turn to your volunteer contributions. How did you first get 
started and what keeps you interested in project management volunteering?
Tarne: I went to my first Project Management Institute conference in 1999. 
One of my co-workers was working on earning the Project Management 
Professional [PMP] certification. That got me thinking that PMI would be a 
good organization to join. I was excited by the conference and returned the 
next year. At the conference in 2000, I went to a session organized by the IT 
& Telecom interest group. At the time, I was working in telecommunications 
at Sprint. I was running a team that was responsible for quality assurance for 
our billing system. I picked up their newsletter, spoke with some people at the 
meeting, and went home. Later on, I reviewed the newsletter and noticed that 
the special interest group had a vacant position on their board. I looked into 
it and joined the board a few weeks later!

Chapter 17 | Bob Tarne, Engagement Manager, IBM
204
At the same time, PMI was starting up its volunteer education programs. I was 
in the first class of what they now call the leadership master class. This one-
year leadership program helps people to become better volunteer leaders. 
Eventually, I became the chairman of the PMI IT & Telecom Special Interest 
Group. I became heavily involved in the annual conference, running events and 
doing outreach to others in the industry. It was to fun to meet people from 
around the world. At a certain point, PMI changed its structure and there 
was no longer volunteer leadership positions related to these special interest 
groups. After that point, involvement became less interesting to me.
At this stage, I’m between volunteer engagements and thinking about what I 
might do next as a volunteer.
Harpham: How did you manage this extensive volunteer commitment in the 
project management community along with everything else in life?
Tarne: The Board had regular conference calls a few times per month and two 
face-to-face meetings per year. Generally, we had our meetings in Las Vegas 
because it is a cheap place to hold meetings. The group would usually arrive on 
a Friday and depart on Sunday. It took away from my free time to participate. 
This involvement was over and above my day-to-day responsibilities with IBM.
That said, I’ve always worked in organizations that have appreciated and 
supported involvement in professional organizations. To some degree, 
professional volunteering has supported my career development. I can think 
of one specific job that I got directly through the networking that I did with 
PMI.
Harpham: How did that opportunity come through your PMI networking?
Tarne: I was in the Leadership Master Class with a group of about fifteen 
other project managers who were also PMI volunteers. During the year, we 
met in person three times over weekends to cover leadership training and 
discussions. I got to know my classmates quite well during this program.
One of my classmates worked for PM Solutions. At the same time, Sprint 
was going through some business difficulties and laying off staff due to the 
telecommunications bust in the early 2000s. My classmate got me in the door 
with PM Solutions, put in a good word for me with the executive team, and I 
had a job interview with the organization. PM Solutions hired me!
Harpham: It sounds like this opportunity was a happy surprise rather than 
a strategy.
Tarne: I didn’t have a specific goal in mind when I started volunteering with 
the organization. At the same time, I knew getting involved with a professional 
organization wasn’t going to hurt and that it would grow my professional 
network.

Harpham: What did you do at PM Solutions?
Tarne: It’s a consulting firm focused on project management. When I joined, 
they had about one hundred employees, some involved in consulting and others 
were staff augmentation project managers. They also did project management 
training. My focus was in the project management consulting—helping clients 
improve their project management processes. I worked with PM Solutions for 
five years before joining IBM in 2008.
Harpham: During your time with PM Solutions, what are some of the 
patterns you would see over and over again on projects?
Tarne: Usually, organizations would recognize that they needed a more formal 
project management approach. One company in particular had some high-
profile project failures. My typical engagement with PM Solutions was to help 
clients create project management methodologies for their needs. We had an 
“off the shelf” methodology based on the PMBOK Guide and we would sell 
that consulting service to the client with customization to meet their needs. 
Customizing the methodology to suit their needs was a key aspect to these 
engagements.
Harpham: What was driving clients to ask for formal project management 
consulting?
Tarne: In one case, their need was driven by some project failures, such as 
blowing the budget, which woke them up to the fact that they needed to 
change. In another case, the focus was on time to market—make sure that you 
get everything done quickly so that you can get new products into the market.
Harpham: After you provide this consulting service to the client, did you 
ever hear from the client six months or a year later to see how the change 
played out?
Tarne: With one large project, I helped them with the methodology. In 
addition, we helped them with a governance model to manage the project 
management environment. We set up a global project management office for 
them. Prior to this point, they had regional project management oversight, but 
no consistency from region to region. I worked with them after all of this was 
rolled out. One of the other services offered by PM Solutions was a project 
management maturity assessment.
With these assessments, we would analyze and grade how well the organization 
did projects. This involved reviewing their project artifacts such as schedules 
or work breakdown structures and seeing how effective they were. We would 
also look at project charters and other aspects of the project process. In 
the case of this large project, we did an initial assessment as the project was 
starting to give us a baseline. A year later, we did another assessment on 
different regions of the organization. It was an ongoing multi-year project to 
provide assessments and give them feedback on their process.

Harpham: Who was the client?
Tarne: The client was a global business software company. Specifically, we 
worked with the unit that ran implementation projects for end customers.
Harpham: You are active in presenting at project management events and 
conferences. How did you get into that?
Tarne: While I was involved in the IT & Telecom group, I decided to present 
on our topics as a way to promote the interest group and attract others 
to join the group. The first presentation I did was called “Ten Barriers to 
Communications.” Both PM Solutions and IBM look favorably on speaking at 
conferences.
The conference experience that stands out to me the most was getting invited 
to present at an event in the Middle East. I presented on different approaches 
to agile, project leadership and Six Sigma. I was one of four US experts invited 
to present. We went to Cairo, Egypt, for four days to deliver a conference. We 
ended up doing the conference over several years [2008–2010]. It was a lot of 
fun to do. It was fun to be featured speaker at the event.
Harpham: Did you engage with the country’s leadership on project 
management?
Tarne: On our first trip, we had a meeting with His Excellency Dr. Ahmed M. 
Darwish, Minister of State for Administrative Development. The government 
was interested in fostering Egyptian project management expertise through 
education. It was the first time I’ve been in a meeting where I had to address 
someone as “Your Excellency.” That was quite the experience.
Harpham: You presented on communication failure at one of your 
presentations. What are some of the communication failures that you see 
most often in the project management field?
Tarne: I have seen cases where people leave a meeting with a different 
understanding of what was discussed—and there are no meeting minutes.  
In other cases, I see unclear status reports—or the failure to provide one at all.  
Overly complex status reports are a problem in some cases. I take pride in 
being able to write an effective status report. An effective status report should 
note accomplishments, highlight risks and issues, and call out dependencies 
that we are relying on the customer to deliver. If you need something from 
your customer to move ahead, you need to tell them. Make it clear what you 
need and when you need it.
Harpham: What else have you seen go wrong with project management 
reports?

Project Managers at Work
207
Tarne: The “watermelon report” is a classic example. Everything looks green 
[i.e., the project is going well] on the surface yet it is red [i.e., the project 
is in serious trouble] on the inside. In that case, the report writer is overly 
optimistic, dishonest, or incompetent in communicating the project’s status. 
I think that approach is driven by the idea that you can fix the problem soon, 
so there’s no need to communicate about it.
Harpham: How do you detect these “watermelon project reports”?
Tarne: I can’t always detect that there’s a problem from reading just the 
report. If I’m close to the project and you see what’s going on, that helps. For 
instance, I may hear a side conversation about certain activities being late and 
yet that information doesn’t make it to the report. That gives you a signal that 
something isn’t quite right. Another sign is if the team seems to be under a lot 
of pressure but there’s nothing in the report to indicate why.
Agile emphasizes short iterations in part to prevent project problems from 
festering and becoming overwhelming. If you have not completed a piece of 
work in two weeks, you know you’re behind. That’s better than going a month 
or two before you bring it up on a status report.
Harpham: Is that specific technique—the two-week sprint—something that 
opens the door to introducing the agile methodology?
Tarne: Demonstrating how agile works is a strong way to show the value of 
agile. I recently came off a short project—the development window was just 
six weeks. We did two-week iterations and provided a demo to the customer 
at the end of each of those two-week units. If you manage it properly, you can 
get work done quickly.
The daily stand-up meeting is another technique that helps to improve results 
for the project. The key points to cover in a stand-up meeting focuses on three 
questions: What did you accomplish since the last meeting? What do you have 
planned for today? Is anything blocking you from moving ahead? It should not 
be a meeting to discuss issues. Just identify the issues and who needs to be 
involved in resolving them. It is a mini-planning meeting for the day.
It’s a way for the team to hold each other responsible for the work they’re 
going to get done. You never go more than a day without knowing that 
somebody has a challenge or a block. That means you can get involved and 
help the team more often as the project manager.
Harpham: From your experience, the daily meeting tempo has a significant 
impact?
Tarne: Yes, it makes a difference.

Chapter 17 | Bob Tarne, Engagement Manager, IBM
208
Harpham: How did you first get exposed to the agile approach?
Tarne: As a PMI volunteer, I was part of an outreach program to connect 
with other organizations such as the Scrum Alliance. At first, PMI was resistant 
to the idea of agile. Eventually, we helped to bridge the gap and see the value 
of agile to running projects. Eventually, PMI allowed us to launch an agile 
community of practice and they introduced the Agile Certified Practitioner 
[ACP] certification to promote these methods. I was also part of the team 
that launched the agile community of practice for PMI. I also helped by writing 
some of the ACP certification exam questions. When it came time to update 
the ACP exam, I was part of the team that reviewed the content after the 
questions were written.
Harpham: Based on your input, did you see changes to the agile certification?
Tarne: They didn’t change too much. The focus was on updating the content 
and the bibliography related to the certification.
Harpham: Let’s turn to listening skills and the role it plays. Public speaking 
skills tend to get a lot of attention. In contrast, listening gets less attention. 
What does effective listening look like in your experience?
Tarne: Watching body language is helpful. Are people engaging with the 
speaker? During the daily stand-up meeting, everyone actually stands in a 
circle. That means everyone is facing each other. That means that everyone is 
engaged with the process. Ideally, the meeting is quick—about fifteen minutes 
long. If somebody is not paying attention and misses something, it is clear that 
they’re not engaged.
Harpham: The quick nature of the meeting could also be a selling point. You 
could say, “If we all focus during this meeting, we’ll be done in fifteen minutes.”
Tarne: Yes, that’s a benefit.
Harpham: What is your approach to leadership and how has it evolved 
through your career?
Tarne: The Navy tends to be a command and control environment—it needs 
to be in order to achieve its mission. Through the PMI leadership program, 
I’ve learned a lot about leadership and that includes understanding how I lead.
I advocate the servant leadership approach where the leader serves the team, 
so that the team can be successful. If we’re doing a software project with a lot 
of smart people ready to work but something is stopping them, it is my role as 
the leader to clear the impediment. I advocate the self-directing team concept.
The situational leadership model is also helpful to keep in mind. Teams go 
through a number of stages starting with the forming stage. When the team is 
forming, the leader needs to be more direct to get started. Later on, the leader 
can take a step back and the leader’s role changes to emphasize delegating, 
coaching, or support.

If I’m working with a team that is unfamiliar with agile, I tend to be more 
directive to show them how work is done. If it is a more senior team that has 
been around the block a few times, I will step back a bit and see how they do 
things. In the case of the senior team, I may occasionally comment, “Did you 
think about trying this approach?”
Harpham: Have there been any books that have made a significant impact 
on your thinking?
Tarne: Stephen Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People [Simon & 
Schuster, 2013] has stood the test of time. I have gone back and re-read it 
several times over the years. He has a good model for how to go from defining 
your vision and then translate that vision to your daily activities.
Harpham: What opportunities and technologies have captured your 
interest? What do you see when you look ahead over the next several years?
Tarne: I recently helped a team that gave a presentation on cognitive 
computing, so that’s an interesting trend that I’m following. In addition, 
understanding the why behind your project will become as important as being 
able to technically deliver the project. I’ve started using some of the principles 
of Design Thinking to help in this area. For me, Design Thinking is making 
sure you have the right problem before you start working on the solution.  
I also see a general trend to deliver projects faster. There’s an expectation that 
companies will deliver improvements and innovation quickly.
Harpham: For the reader who is looking to break into project management 
from another field, such as software development or engineering, what do you 
suggest they do to get started in projects?
Tarne: My volunteer history has been a major contributor to how I have 
developed my career. Volunteering with the PMI organization is a great 
move. You can also volunteer with other organizations where you have an 
opportunity to work as a project manager, even if it is outside of your normal 
field of professional work.
My wife is a talented project manager, even though she doesn’t see herself 
that way. She’s got good skills for organizing and keeping track of the details 
of large-scale activities. For example, she ran the high school band trip a few 
years ago, which involved a lot of coordination to move over one hundred 
students to the right place for a five-day trip.
You can also apply the volunteering approach within the organization you 
work for. You might volunteer to do something that goes beyond your 
usual responsibilities. Look for a way to demonstrate that you have project 
management skills.

Chapter Summary
• 
Recommended books include The 7 Habits of Highly Effective 
People by Stephen Covey.
• 
Career transitions: Seek outside resources (e.g., MBA 
programs and specialized recruiters) to support your 
career moves.
• 
Courage: As the project manager, you have a key role to 
stand up for the project’s success and your approach (e.g., 
agile). Tarne’s experience shows that traditional solutions, 
such as assigning more people to a project, does not 
always help.
• 
Professional development and volunteering: Tarne grew  
his career as a volunteer leader at the Project Management 
Institute and as a speaker. This activity also led to new 
relationships and career opportunities.
• 
Communication failure on projects: Examine your project 
documents, such as weekly status reports, and ask 
yourself if these documents provide clear and transparent 
information to the reader.

Ray Grainger
CEO, Mavenlink
Ray Grainger is the co-founder and CEO of Mavenlink, where he is leading the 
mission to reinvent the way businesses do work. He has dedicated his career to 
helping clients succeed, and brings over 25 years of experience in software and 
high-technology consulting to Mavenlink. Grainger began his career at Accenture, 
where he spent 17 years honing his expertise in professional services management 
as global managing partner. During his time at Accenture, he also invested in several 
technology companies through Accenture Technology Ventures, including enterprise 
knowledge management vendor InQuira. He later became Executive Vice President 
of Professional Services and Strategic Alliances at InQuira (acquired by Oracle in 
2011), where he met his Mavenlink co-founders, Roger Neel and Sean Crafts.
In his spare time, Grainger is a true adventurer. He is an avid diver and a world traveler. 
He served on two expeditions to Antarctica with the National Science Foundation 
(for which he earned the congressional Antarctica Service Medal). He holds a BS in 
engineering, with distinction, from Harvey Mudd College, where he is also a trustee.
Bruce Harpham: What career lessons did you learn from starting your career 
at Accenture?
Ray Grainger: Starting my career with Accenture had several benefits. It’s a 
good mentoring organization. You learn a lot from your immediate supervisors 
who are close to you in age and therefore have recent experience with your 
type of work. You learn supervisory skills, managing people, communication, 
and related foundational skills to be a good manager in the context of client 
services. Asking good questions, managing tasks, and getting clarification are 
some of the other skills you learn over the first four to six years at the firm. It 
takes about that much time to become a project manager in the organization.

Harpham: What kinds of projects were you involved in with Accenture?
Grainger: My early projects were technology related—applying technology 
in large companies. In my case, it was in the aerospace and defense industry. In 
the late 1980s, the industry was going through the first wave of MRP [material 
requirements planning] implementations, the predecessor to ERP [enterprise 
resource planning]. This technology supported a broad range of planning and 
execution in manufacturing in the aerospace and defense industries.
Harpham: Would this be Lockheed Martin, Boeing, or Airbus? Those kinds 
of companies?
Grainger: Yes, exactly. Northrop Grumman Corporation was my big first 
client when I joined Accenture out of college. I was working on large-scale, 
complex manufacturing, planning, and execution systems.
Harpham: Was that your first exposure to the aerospace industry?
Grainger: Yes, it was the first time I had worked in that industry. I had worked 
on large-scale projects prior to joining to Accenture. I had worked with the 
National Science Foundation in Antarctica earlier. Each season, there was a 
portfolio of projects. It’s a whole different experience down there. In that 
environment, you have significant resource constraints and you are working 
with people from around the world. I learned how to operate in large-scale 
projects and I found that work interesting. I had to collaborate with new 
people I’ve just met and work together to get a project delivered.
Harpham: What was it like to get work done in this extreme environment? 
What did you work on?
Grainger: I worked on many projects while I was there—some took several 
years and others were short term. The longer-term projects were a challenge 
because you had to take hiatus for part of the year. It was dark and you 
couldn’t get anything done.
One notable project was to build an emergency camp at the South Pole. Each 
year, there is a winter group that keeps the South Pole station operational and 
does some winter-related science work and experiments. If the main station 
goes up in flames, they need a backup place to live for the rest of the winter.
The team and I built an emergency camp that needed to support about seventy 
people for the winter period—about four months—without any support from 
the rest of the world. We needed to figure out what types of facilities were 
needed. Logistically, it was very interesting. We prefabricated much of the 
project deliverables at another location, dissembled it, put everything on giant 
sleds and then on a C31 airplane. We had to get it done on time—there’s no 
flexibility on schedule in that world.

213
It was also interesting to work with a variety of disciplines like carpenters, 
plumbers, and so forth. None of them had ever worked together and they had 
to come together quickly. There was no room for failure. Everybody knows 
that we had to succeed—there is no other choice. The deadline is fixed and 
there is no way to get more resources. It forces you to be resourceful and 
get along well with others.
The people you have on the team are also fixed—you can’t bring in someone 
new! You’re not only working together, you’re also living together. You’re in 
the same environment with the team twenty-four hours a day. I encountered 
real differences between people but I had to find a way to work through that.
I went through this experience between graduating from high school 
and starting my college studies. I learned how to do projects through this 
experience. My life has been made up of projects ever since then.
Harpham: It’s clear that you have succeeded in different environments. First, 
it was Antarctica. Then you moved into management consulting. Today, you’re 
running a project management software company. How do you navigate the 
transition from consulting to the software field?
Grainger: As you move through different career stages, you gain different 
skills and ideas that you put into your career “knap sack.” Looking at the first 
consulting projects I did at Accenture, I took several skills away from that. I 
learned about project metrics—tracking time, the importance of accurate 
tracking, and estimation methods. Those insights were independent of the 
specific industry I was working on.
As you move up in your career, domain expertise becomes very important. In 
the aerospace and defense industries, that may mean learning the manufacturing 
process and how it will be impacted by technology projects. After six or 
seven years in that aerospace and defense, I moved to another industry. That 
transition was partially driven by a substantial decline in US defense spending 
in the early 1990s.
We applied the insights we learned from aerospace and applied it to the 
high-tech industry generally. For example, I can apply the same framework 
to manufacturing network routers for Cisco. It also applies to building and 
managing the lifecycle of software products. I migrated from big industrial 
manufacturing to fast-paced high-tech manufacturing. That was a transition for 
me from a domain perspective.
That said, I always had expertise in technology deployment. I knew a lot about 
software from that work. As I moved into the high-tech field, I acquired clients 
in the software industry. That included clients like BAE Systems. You can apply 
similar processes—product management and design—to a different field. You 
can always find analogs between your experience in the past and the current 
domain you’re working in.

Chapter 18 | Ray Grainger, CEO, Mavenlink
214
Over nearly twenty years, I was exposed to software companies on various 
consulting assignments. Those experiences informed my approach when I 
decided to run my own software company.
Harpham: As you described your industry transition, I’m reminded of the 
concept of the “peace dividend.” The idea that defense spending could be 
reduced after the Cold War and those funds could be put into tax cuts or 
other spending. In your case, it was a dividend of knowledge that you could 
apply to other industries.
Grainger: Yes, I was able to transfer those ideas and processes elsewhere. 
The aerospace and defense industries have excellent processes to ensure 
quality and reliability. The industry also has a high need for project control 
and accounting—funding was always well understood in that world. All of 
those skills were transferable to my current work—building software for the 
services industry.
Harpham: Let’s turn to the origins of Mavenlink. How do you come to start 
the company? What was the first year of Mavenlink like?
Grainger: It was a white-knuckle experience for that first year!
Prior to starting Mavenlink, I invested in an enterprise knowledge management 
company called InQuira, through Accenture Technology Ventures. I joined that 
company as the Executive Vice President of Professional Services and Strategic 
Alliances, with the idea that I would later start my own software company.
When we decided to start Mavenlink, it was the fall of 2008. I persuaded my 
co-founders, Roger Neel and Sean Crafts, to join me and we were excited. 
I sold some of my Accenture stock in order to fund the business with seed 
capital. Roger left InQuira shortly after I left the company. He got married, left 
on his honeymoon, and then came back to work on the company. Two weeks 
later, October 2008 arrived and everything started to crater.
Fortunately, the timing went well in one respect. We had set up our seed 
capital earlier in the year before the stock market took a dive. We had sold 
while asset prices were high and had a lot of cash on hand. We dodged the 
bullet from that perspective—had we sold assets later in the year, there would 
have far less to work with in getting the company underway. In the broader 
environment, venture capital was drying up fast.
In January 2009, we started to develop the product. At the same time, the 
financial crisis and recession were underway. We took our seed capital and 
spread it across multiple bank accounts so that no single account was over the 
FDIC limit for deposit insurance. There were worries we could lose money if 
a bank happened to go under. It was a wacky experience! On the other hand, 
certain expenses became much more affordable. We could take flights within 
California for about $29 each way on Virgin America and get a hotel room for 
$59 a night. We were able to stretch our capital a long way.

Project Managers at Work
215
You have to remember that we didn’t know how long the recession was going 
to last. Some thought it might become a depression. We were committed 
to building the company and going for it. We made sure to handle money 
carefully throughout, however.
By July 2009, I remember talking to my co-founders and saying, “Well, the 
world didn’t end. It looks like the recovery is starting. Let’s keep building our 
business.” The first year was tough!
Harpham: When did the first paying customers come in?
Grainger: We had the first paying customers in January 2010. During 2009, 
we were building the product. We had to define the breadth and boundaries 
of the product. How many business processes were important to cover? We 
went through a lot of product iterations based on feedback from the market 
during the first year.
Harpham: What was the product development process?
Grainger: We knew we wanted to target creative and professional services—
notably marketing agencies, IT services firms, management consultants, and 
professional service providers—basically companies that perform services for 
a fee to clients. We felt that the existing software for this market was not 
good enough. We first pushed the product to everyone in those industries we 
knew through our network.
Initially, we pushed out the product on a free basis. People at Accenture would 
use it to run their projects. In total, we had one thousand people try the 
product out. This was all people from my network and other people involved 
in the company at the time.
Consultants were frank in providing their feedback, which was helpful. They 
didn’t say vague positive comments. They would tell us, “This sucks!” Or, “If 
you don’t make this, my clients will never use the product with me.” This 
feedback made a difference in improving the product during the trial period.
In some cases, we would bring people into the design stage and tell them, 
“Here’s what this feature would look like. Is this what you had in mind?” Then 
we would get back comments like, “Yes, that’s what we asked for but it’s not 
what we really need.” That meant more changes to fine-tune the product and 
trying to make it better with each iteration.
Harpham: When you got on the phone with these early users, what were 
they telling you?

Chapter 18 | Ray Grainger, CEO, Mavenlink
216
Grainger: We would hear comments in this general theme: “We love the 
concept but the product seems raw.” I remember being hurt by those kinds of 
comments. Digging deeper on those comments, they meant that “the product 
has to do so much more to be valuable to us.” I was surprised to hear that 
people wanted more depth in order to use the product. I had thought this 
is SaaS [software as a service] product and that fewer features would be a 
good fit. However, there was demand for more features. The expectations for 
project management software are high—higher than I would have thought.
Harpham: There are a lot of project management software offerings on the 
market. Who is the ideal user for Mavenlink?
Grainger: I came from the professional services industry and that informed 
my approach. What I found is that there are good tools for the professional 
project manager, such as Microsoft Project. However, I noticed that many 
projects were run by people who were not full time project managers. Yet, 
those people had to manage multiple stakeholders, including client participants 
and subcontractors. The project software addressed the needs of the project 
manager, but everyone else was using email and other tools.
I envisioned a multi-stakeholder application to manage the business of 
professional services companies. There were some existing tools that 
addressed scheduling, time capture, or accounting. There was nothing that 
brought it all together in the way we envisioned.
Harpham: What is the interplay between improving results with software 
such as Mavenlink and the people side of projects? Some people assume that 
their project problems will go away if only they had the right software.
Grainger: If the business has clarity on one or two overarching goals with 
adopting a tool like Mavenlink, that makes a tremendous impact. For example, 
if a company has the goal to make all of their projects more profitable with 
a motivated CFO, that helps. Without that clarity, people sometimes struggle 
with the change, because adopting Mavenlink processes can be quite different 
from what they’re using today.
That’s true for any project. You need to be able to answer, “Why does this 
project matter to the business?” With that motivation, you can engage people 
to work on the project. It doesn’t work well to provide the software and say, 
“OK, get started!” The underlying behavior needs to adjust as well. All of the 
stakeholders need to be engaged.
Harpham: Let’s explore change management further. There have been many 
horror stories in technology projects where the project team builds something 
great and hands it off to the business only to find that nobody uses it. What 
have been some of your lessons learned in doing change management well?

Project Managers at Work
217
Grainger: At the start of the project, you need to understand the magnitude 
of the change. Some changes are large and some are not. What are we changing 
to? How big of a change is it? Risk is another factor to consider. You may have 
a small change that impacts a critical business process—that will need to be 
managed closely. In contrast, you may have a big change underway where there 
will be limited negative impact if it goes poorly.
You have to spend to the time to understand the stakeholders on the project 
to get change done well. After that, understand the project’s change details 
and what does it impact. Does it impact everyone in the company globally or 
does it have a local impact?
Duration also needs to be considered. If you are doing a multi-year technology 
project, there is a high likelihood that you will get fatigue for the project at 
some time. It could be fatigue on the project team itself or the business. 
During a project of this length, the business itself may change substantially due 
to an acquisition or divestiture.
Harpham: What have been some of your project management lessons 
learned over the years?
Grainger: In working with clients, I understand the pressures involved. Some 
of the projects involve large amounts of money. Some of them are “bet the 
business” projects. In order to achieve success in those settings, you have to 
understand the client’s expectations.
What are their expectations of the project?
What are their expectations on how you interact with them?
How frank do they want you be?
What is their communication style?
If there is an issue, how do you want they want that addressed? Do they want 
to be personally told? Or handle it through a steering committee?
Addressing these questions help you to get off on the right foot. On these 
large projects, trust needs to be developed quickly and maintained during the 
project. It’s often effective to seek to build a personal connection that goes 
beyond the project.
It’s important to lay this foundation before you hit the first speed bump on 
the project, because problems will occur no matter what. You just don’t know 
when it will happen. When you have a strong relationship, you will be able 
to get through the problems better. If you successfully work through the 
problems, trust is enhanced further.
Building trust and managing expectations are essential project management 
activities. It takes a while to get really good with trust and expectations.

Chapter 18 | Ray Grainger, CEO, Mavenlink
218
Harpham: Expectations are interesting to manage. My definition of fast and 
your definition of fast may be very different. Can you share a story where your 
client had significantly different expectations and how do you manage that?
Grainger: Client perceptions of speed were often different than my view. 
They thought something could be done much faster than my experience said 
was possible. They might think the project would take three months while 
I consider it more like six months. That’s double the time and probably double 
the cost as well.
The confidence builder for me in addressing these conversations came from 
early in my career. I was wrestling with how to deal with this challenge. I didn’t 
want to just capitulate to the demand, because that would cause other 
problems. A client partner told me once, “You have done twenty technology 
implementation projects by the time you’re a client partner. In contrast, your 
client will have done maybe two in their entire career. You will have so much 
more experience than the client. You will have examples to draw on. The 
client knows their business better than you, but you understand this type of 
project far better than the client.”
Nearly every time, the client would come in with a time estimate that sharply 
disagreed with my view of what was possible. That meant a conversation 
with the client to challenge their assumptions. Of course, you don’t want to 
challenge them in a condescending way. Simply refer to past examples of similar 
projects and point out what was involved in them. Steer the conversation 
toward risk. Explore the magnitude of the changes being considered and the 
assumptions in play.
I would often make comments like, “Moving a project like this fast doesn’t give 
people the opportunity to make the change effectively.” Ultimately, that could 
translate into the project taking longer to complete.
Harpham: How did you have conversations about project trade-offs?
Grainger: I had one big client where we were doing a technology 
implementation for their customer support organization. The customer 
support unit had thousands of employees so this project would have a 
significant impact in terms of people. The company was selling expensive 
technology projects around the world that were complex to configure and 
maintain.
The client needed the support center to be operational in three months. 
My experience said it would take six months, but they said they needed it in 
three months because they were committed to supporting a new product. So 
I looked into the trade-off implications. I reviewed the scope and looked at 
what could be done. I proposed to move the training and change management 
activities to after the technology implementation. That’s usually not a good 
idea to do. In this project, the schedule was set and there was no flexibility.

I explained that we could offer a post-implementation change management 
service for $600,000. The client signed up within thirty minutes of the 
discussion. They knew it was necessary for long-term success. Ironically, if 
they had done the project differently, that service probably would have cost 
one-third as much. However, they were committed to meeting their schedule. 
The date was the date.
Harpham: The question is not “Will we do change management?”—but 
rather when and for how much?
Grainger: If you skip change management, you’re likely to fail. As the 
project manager, you have to assess and understand the organization’s risk 
tolerance for disruption. In this case, they were willing to tolerate stress 
and disruption to meet their date. In practical terms, that meant managers 
at the client had to tell their people: “We’re going to go live with this on 
this date. You’re not going to get training on it until a later time. I’m going 
to ask you to be adaptable and understanding to the situation.”
Harpham: What goes into your personal productivity practice?
Grainger: Start with the fundamentals. If the project manager arrives late 
and disorganized, it creates a bad impression. So personal productivity impacts 
how you are perceived as well as how effective you are.
Taking a systematic approach is one method I have practiced to boost 
productivity. Back at Accenture, some of our technology implementation 
projects, such as implementing a SAP product had certain common points. 
Everyone had clarity on the goal and how projects like this are run. When you 
start the project with clarity on the goal and the process, it creates a good 
impression. Look for plans, templates, and processes that can be reused.
Harpham: How do you recommend project managers succeed in a matrix 
environment?
Grainger: Some matrix organizations handle this well. At Accenture, the 
project manager would provide comments on your performance directly to 
the line manager. That would give you the chance to shine based on your 
project contributions. In that environment, your project manager determines 
the difference of your career through the feedback they provide.
Harpham: What other insights have you learned about project best practices 
that we haven’t covered?
Grainger: I think it’s important to give people flexibility and find ways to 
minimize the stress of business travel. Both of those factors have influenced 
the creation and design of Mavenlink’s products.
Providing clarity on what you want people to do is incredibly important. 
Your priorities may change and you need to let the team know that. It’s 
understandable to change your mind. When you do, make sure that decision 
is clear to the team.

Chapter 18 | Ray Grainger, CEO, Mavenlink
220
You have to deeply understand the stakeholders. I’m surprised at the number 
of project managers that lack that understanding. If this is missed, the project 
may be shut down or you may be removed as the project manager. Creating 
a stakeholder map where you take note of who holds power and how 
communication needs to flow is part of the picture. It goes beyond creating a 
document. For important stakeholders, a personal touch goes a long way. In a 
way, you almost have to act like an account manager even if you are exclusively 
dealing with internal stakeholders. You may need to meet with people on the 
project individually to understand their needs and win their support.
I recall cases where the CIO is at odds with the business leader. There are 
cases where the CIO and the business leader have a different agenda and 
a different career objective. The CIO may see me as a vehicle to achieve a 
certain career objective. In contrast, the business leader is focused on the 
business outcome of the project. At the ground level, these observations 
translate into actions like helping the CIO prepare for a critical presentation 
and taking the business leader out for some fun at the ball game. Treating both 
of them in the same way would have been ineffective.
Chapter Summary
• 
Lessons learned from consulting: Grainger developed 
subject matter experience in technology implementations 
in a variety of industries. These experiences laid a foundation 
for future success.
• 
Team work in extreme conditions: Grainger’s experience 
includes working on projects at the South Pole. If you had 
to find a way to work effectively with people in a closed 
environment, how would you do it?
• 
Starting Mavenlink: Developing a project management 
and collaboration software tool like Mavenlink was full 
of surprises and required adjustments to better meet the 
needs of users.
• 
Change management: This “last mile” effort makes a major 
difference in a project’s long-term success. Without it, 
your stakeholders and users are likely to experience 
greater stress.
• 
Understanding the needs of key stakeholders: Find out 
what your most important stakeholders are interested 
in (e.g., exposure for career growth, personal growth, or 
some other goal) and look for ways to meet those needs 
with the project.

Seth J. Gillespie
Senior Project Manager, Apple
Dr. Seth J. Gillespie is currently a senior project manager at Apple. Gillespie has 
experience in information technology and management within a variety of industries, 
including hardware and software engineering, pharmaceuticals and biotech, motion 
picture films, natural and renewable energy generation, and management consulting.
Gillespie earned a PhD in organization and management, specializing in information 
technology management; an MBA, with an emphasis in technology management; 
and a BS in molecular biology, with a minor in economics. In addition, he holds 
PMP (Project Management Professional), PMI-ACP (Agile Certified Practitioner), CSM 
(Certified ScrumMaster), ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), and 
CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) credentials.
In his free time, Gillespie enjoys traveling and assisting in social justice causes 
benefiting under-served groups worldwide.
Bruce Harpham: How did you first get involved in project management?
Seth Gillespie: I started my career as an IT systems engineer after finishing 
college. My first job out of college was a small biotech company called Agouron 
Pharmaceuticals, which developed and manufactured unique protein molecules 
that play a role in treating serious diseases like cancer, as well as novel and life-
saving antiretroviral drugs impacting millions worldwide. I wanted to get my 
foot in the door and learn about the biotech industry. I had some consulting 
experience in IT work previously, so this role was a good fit. I worked at that 
company for about four years as a systems engineer primarily involved in data 
center design, networks, and computer build-out and maintenance. In addition, 
19

I gained great experience building networked labs at several field sites for 
science and office staff, which sometimes required donning a hazmat suit!
It was during this first job out of college that I realized I did not need to be 
stuck in a profession that my degree in science would lead to. I was really 
empowered in the realization that I enjoyed working in IT—and the rest is 
history. Working at Agouron was interesting and fascinating for me, especially 
since the company was small [i.e., under 500 employees] when I started. As it 
turns out, Agouron was acquired by Pfizer, a global pharmaceutical company 
in the Fortune 500. I had the opportunity to work on the integration required 
to merge the two companies’ back-end systems together, with a focus on data 
center services.
Around this time, I received a recruiting call from a biotech company in the 
San Francisco Bay Area. I credit the cold call to my volunteer and industry 
talks, which gave visibility to my work and accomplishments outside of my 
company. Even though I grew up and went to college in the San Diego area, I 
hadn’t spent much time in San Francisco. It turns out that the company was 
actually right across the Bay from San Francisco and in the same city as Pixar 
headquarters. The hiring manager at the company told me, “We like your 
technical background at Agouron and what you did with the Pfizer merger. 
We’d like you to interview for a project manager position in our IT group. We 
think it would be a great fit for you.”
When I heard this, I thought to myself, “Well, I’ve never had the project 
manager title. Does it make sense for me to take a flight to interview for this 
job—even if they are paying for it?”
Harpham: At this point, you were wrestling with the career change to move 
into a project manager role. How did you think about it and make a decision?
Gillespie: I was nervous about it because I didn’t think that I was qualified. 
On the other hand, I had experience with IT hardware and software deploy-
ments, data center management, and procurement in my previous roles. I had 
worked with project managers through my career, and I understood their 
value to the organization. In a way, I always looked up to them. In the first few 
years of my career, I was in an individual contributor role.
In moving to project management, I was able to have a greater impact than 
what I could achieve as an individual. Moving to project management was a 
major breakthrough for my career.
Harpham: Given your concerns, how did the job interview unfold?
Gillespie: The hiring manager told me that my technical background and 
accomplishments were great. They wanted me to build on my experience 
and take it to the next level at Chiron, a mid-sized biotech firm in the San 
Francisco Bay Area. They asked me to fly up to their location, spend the day 
with them, and put my hat in the ring. I really needed that push from the 

Project Managers at Work
223
company, because I didn’t feel that I was qualified at first. I interviewed with 
the team and learned about their projects. They were pleased with me and I 
accepted the role. That’s when I officially became a project manager.
Harpham: The transition to this role involved building on your prior 
accomplishments in technology?
Gillespie: It wasn’t as if I came to that role directly from college with a 
degree in molecular biology and started working as an IT project manager. My 
undergraduate degree was in science and that led me to the opportunity at 
the first biotech company. While there, I excelled in IT work for several years. 
Eventually, I was recognized for my IT work and then hired into the project 
manager role. It was a great role and included international travel! I worked 
with Chiron for about four years, before my next pivot.
Interestingly, I did not have a PMP certification or an MBA degree when I 
started the project manager role. Therefore, I chose to pursue both a PMP 
and an MBA degree on my own. I felt that I needed more knowledge to 
continue growing my skills, especially now that I had greater responsibility for 
projects of increasing complexity and cost. I enrolled in UC Berkeley’s project 
management certificate program. Completing that program started me down 
the path of lifelong learning. I kept learning and studying in various advanced 
programs in the years ahead, including Stanford University. I also sought out 
other professional programs, including Toastmasters for professional speaking, 
which I recommend to this day.
It was a seminal move for my career. For about six months, I was a bit 
uncomfortable. I didn’t know if I would make it or if I would be a good fit for the 
role. Fortunately, my manager, who had himself earned a PhD, saw my potential, 
in addition to the great work I had done through past accomplishments, and 
believed in me enough to enable me to succeed as a project manager, which 
I did.
While at Chiron, I had the opportunity to travel extensively within the United 
States, Germany, and Italy on various business trips to lead data center 
expansion projects. During this time, my expertise in biotech matters, such 
as the FDA’s [Federal Drug Administration] IT record keeping and software 
development requirements, helped me to add value to the business.
Looking back, I realized early in my career as a systems administrator that 
there was a limit on what I could contribute to the organization as an 
individual contributor. There are only so many hours in the day after all. As 
a project manager, I could work those same hours and make a much greater 
impact by leading the project team. But it’s not for the faint of heart. It’s hard 
work and sometimes long hours, but it is well worth it. I felt a greater sense 
of accomplishment along with recognition from that work.

Chapter 19 | Seth J. Gillespie, Senior Project Manager, Apple

Harpham: What is your approach to project management?
Gillespie: I believe that project management is both an art and a science. 
The science side includes the best practices described in the PMBOK Guide 
and related training resources. For example, how to set up a project schedule, 
how to set up a project charter and a Gantt chart, and how to use project 
management software. All of that is only half the story of project management.
The art side of project management is interpersonal skills. For example, 
empathy comes to play a major role. I had to develop these interpersonal 
skills to a much higher level to be effective. It was very different from my 
science background and my analytical side. To be successful, you have to 
master empathy and interpersonal skills, as well the science-side skills, such as 
scheduling and cost accounting.
Often, you will find yourself asking a person to do something that is challenging 
or unrealistic for them to do. For example, to deploy a large project impacting 
millions—with many unknowns or with a high level of complexity or 
uncertainty—in a very short amount of time.
As a project manager, I’m there for my team. I’m not there to throw anyone 
under the bus. If I am doing my job right, I’m there to shield them, to defend 
them, and to empower them, so that they can get the impossible done. In 
addition, my role is to remove blocks that are standing in their way to become 
successful. At the end of the day, even if it is a stressful or drawn-out project, 
I want my future team members to see my name as the PM and be excited to 
work with me—not because it will be easy all the time, or that I will know all 
the secrets, but because together we will do great things.
Some project managers may emphasize one aspect more than others. 
A people-oriented project manager may be deeply connected with the 
team, but lose sight of the analytical or science side, such as the schedule 
and documentation. I feel that you need to have the analytical and the 
interpersonal aspects [or the “art and science”] to be successful in this field.
Harpham: What does it mean to remove blocks that are impacting the team? 
Can you share an example of what that looks like?
Gillespie: My analytical side will break down blocks into two categories. 
The first category—it’s either an ability problem or it is a motivation 
problem. If there is an ability problem, that means there is a tool, a process, 
a procedure that the individual cannot manage on their own. Ability 
problems can be solved by providing the technology, training or additional 
help required to do the task. If we’re working on a software development 
project, an ability problem could be solved by pairing the person with 
somebody else who has the skills, so that they can learn what is required, 
or by giving them mentorship or other technical help.

Project Managers at Work
225
A motivation problem means that the team member has the ability and 
expertise to do the work, however, they don’t understand where they fit within 
the schedule. The person may object that the schedule is unrealistic. Or, you 
may get no specific feedback at all. That’s more common in my experience. 
You just don’t hear back from the person, so you have to guess about whether 
the activity is being worked on.
When there’s a motivation problem, it may not be any fault of the individual. In 
fact, they may be very senior in their role. To address the motivation problem 
as the project manager, I help explain the significance of their contributions 
and how what they do impacts others downstream in the project.
The project team member may not realize that if they complete the task by 
Friday at five p.m., this will not allow the offshore team to complete critical 
work downstream. They may not realize how their contributions [or lack 
thereof] impact other people working on the project. By showing how their 
work—big or small—fits into the big picture, they better understand how 
their contribution to the project and to other people matter. That’s how their 
deliverable came to have its deadline. It’s not just a made-up deadline. Typically, 
the motivation problem is solved by giving the person greater context and 
encouraging them to see how their contribution fits into the overall schedule.
Harpham: In a large company, you may need some input or an approval from 
another department to move forward on the project. In a bank, you may need 
to engage and obtain approval from information security and internal audits 
to move ahead on a project. Thus, the block on the project could be some 
other department failing to pay attention. How do you address that challenge?
Gillespie: I would diagnose that situation as a motivation problem. In my 
view, the project manager should own the communication—in terms of both 
the formal communication plan and the stakeholders. The project manager 
is responsible for making those tough calls: “Look, we need sign off on the 
risk management plan by next Wednesday. If we don’t get it by then, we are in 
danger of missing our deadlines in Q2.” Typically, the project manager has the 
unique insight and understanding of the downstream activities to be able to 
make that call and push through that kind of barrier.
Mindset is important here. It’s not a question of blame or making another 
group look bad. It’s just a question of stating the facts and the consequences 
of inaction. The communication needs to bring visibility to the task.
Let’s say you foresee an issue. You can proactively prepare for it with an email. 
Write a note that says: “A sign-off is coming. You will get the materials on 
[this date]. Here’s the high-level goal we’re working on with the project.” In 
the case where you get no feedback from the stakeholder and you’re worried 
about the deadline, then a phone call is a good move. A short call to the leader 
or an ally with influence can help. Ask if they are on schedule to complete 
the activity by the deadline and ask if they need any clarification or additional 

Chapter 19 | Seth J. Gillespie, Senior Project Manager, Apple
226
information to move ahead. This kind of iteration not only helps as a gentle 
reminder, but also makes the communication more interactive than one-way, 
which is always good in my experience.
If the other person is at the same office location, I like to visit them in person. 
For some stakeholders, if you are out of sight, you are out of mind. Make 
yourself known. I don’t consider following up diligently to be “bugging” the 
person. I don’t apologize for it either. I’m there to ensure the project’s success 
for the organization. I’ve never been told I’m too persistent, because I do it 
with tact and empathy.
I’ve found time and time again that varying the communication approach is 
valuable. Some people prefer a phone call. Others like email. Some like text 
messages or IM [instant messaging]. It’s important to learn those preferences 
and act accordingly. If you do that, people will be thankful for the reminders. 
I get compliments and positive feedback that people appreciate my diligence 
as a project manager. The team knows that I’m helping them to be successful.
Harpham: You made a good point about the follow-up being a proactive 
strategy to ensure success, rather than seeing it as complaining.
Gillespie: Absolutely. There’s an art to the follow-up. The analytical side of 
you may want to check off the task as done and move on. However, the art 
side can include learning the skill to read between the lines. What is the 
person saying? What is the person not saying? Sometimes chatting about the 
weather and other topics helps you to connect with the person. I see the 
value in chitchat to connect, but I do keep it to a minimum—not only out of 
respect for my time, but their time as well.
I’ve seen some project managers who are incredibly friendly. It seems like they 
want to become your best friend. They’ll talk about their family or the weekend 
for twenty or thirty minutes. That’s great on the social side, however, that 
approach is too much of a good thing. On the other side, you don’t want walk 
up to someone and immediately say, “Hey, what is the status of your task?”
Harpham: What have you learned about running projects through formal 
study versus hard-won experience in the trenches?
Gillespie: I see great value in the structure and documentation that PMI and 
other organizations advocate in running projects. In my view, it’s mandatory 
to learn about these frameworks, especially in the IT sector. Understanding 
the project management framework is important. The next step is to think 
through how this framework applies to the organization and the people 
on your team. Some people have a “take it or leave it” approach to these 
frameworks and structures.
In my experience, I have come to realize that each organization is different and I 
need to keep that in mind in how I run projects. For example, companies vary on 
the degree of documentation they require on projects. Let’s consider two cases. 

Project Managers at Work
227
One organization values a high degree of documentation: there’s templates, status 
reports, A significant amount of project data is collected, detailed schedules, 
and so forth. As the project manager, I will take care of all that documentation. 
For the project team members, I will shield them from that burden as much as 
possible so that they have more capacity and energy to do their work.
If the organization requires paper documents to be signed or approvals to 
be managed, I will take care of those requirements. If I didn’t have the PMI 
understanding, I would not be successful in a highly documentation-oriented 
environment, such as the pharmaceutical/biotech industry. Those industries 
require a high degree of documentation, because your work has implications 
on patient safety and there are compliance considerations.
When I led projects in the pharmaceutical field, we had five- to six-inch-thick 
binders for each project. We had detailed project charters, data on software 
releases, user acceptance testing, and much more. The formal project 
management training is simply required to be successful in that context.
On the flip side, I have been in start-ups and companies with a lower level 
of project management maturity. There’s nothing wrong with that culture. In 
this context, I can still excel as a project manager. Instead, I will maintain the 
schedule, the work breakdown structure, roles, and responsibilities for my 
own purposes and not showcase them. That documentation helps me to be 
successful. I know who to contact and when to keep the project moving along. 
By keeping that process documentation on my desk, I don’t insist that people 
use project procedures, such as submitting changes via signed change orders. 
In that culture, change management is fast and customer driven. It’s more agile 
and I’m OK with that. However, if I didn’t have the training and education 
in project management, I would be running around in circles trying to stay 
organized and I would get frustrated fast.
Finally, I don’t try to encourage everyone to adopt a highly detailed approach 
to project management. Those processes help me to be effective and keep me 
sane. I respect that some companies have a culture that does not recognize 
those processes and formal structures. Some organizations may not understand 
the purpose or value of a RACI [a chart listing an individual’s relationship 
to the project in one or more of four categories: Responsible, Accountable, 
Consulted, And Informed] chart, for example. In that case, there’s no need to 
fight or try to make them adopt it. Just maintain it for your purposes if you 
find it helpful.
Harpham: Is fine-tuning your approach to the organization’s culture and 
risk appetite important in deciding how and when to apply formal project 
management processes?
Gillespie: Yes. I do look for opportunities where it makes sense to surface 
a project management best practice. However, I’m not going to push it too 
far. I think it’s great to introduce one or two processes to improve results, 

Chapter 19 | Seth J. Gillespie, Senior Project Manager, Apple
228
instead of pushing to adopt a whole project management methodology. If the 
organization is failing or struggling, you may have a mandate to implement 
significant change or an improvement program. In that case, you have a “moral 
authority” to implement a more extensive change to adopt formal project 
management processes.
Harpham: What is a project management strategy that you’ve learned the 
hard way?
Gillespie: Empathy is something that I’ve had to learn over time. Earlier in my 
career, empathy was less of a requirement because I was simply focused on 
my tasks as an individual contributor. When I moved to my first few years as 
a project manager, my greatest lesson was realizing how much I had to learn.
As a new project manager, I would put together a project schedule or a Gantt 
chart. I would put deadlines for tasks and deliverables on the schedule based 
on my understanding of what was involved. I didn’t consult with other people. 
I imagined that other people were too busy to provide their input. The 
fundamental problem with that approach is that you’re creating the project 
plan and schedule in isolation. Even if you have personally done the work, you 
may think that you don’t have to get estimates or validate your estimates 
with other people. I had done data center projects previously, so I thought I 
could estimate them based on my past experience. In reality, it is critical to get 
estimates and feedback from the project team. Even if the project team comes 
back with estimates that directly match your estimates, it is still important to 
do it.
More often, you find gaps and blind spots in your thinking. You may 
underestimate some areas and overestimate other areas. Believe it or not, 
people will be forthright if you ask them how long an activity will take to 
complete, versus simply assigning a deadline.
Harpham: There are two benefits from this engagement. First, you get 
the immediate benefit of a higher-quality estimate. Second, you gain greater 
engagement from the person who provided their input.
Gillespie: Let me expand on that. If I know of a better way to do a project 
or a task, and I have a team member who may differ from that opinion, I will 
generally defer to the team member. If they fail at that task, they will learn from 
that experience. It’s better for them to learn from that experience rather than 
me simply telling them how I would do it. That’s important because we have 
to allow our team members to make mistakes and own them. This is assuming 
that the task has some leeway on it. Obviously, you don’t want to put anybody 
in danger or cause a critical failure.
Believe it or not, these different ways of doing things can often lead to 
innovation. If I had insisted that that person do it my way, the project may have 
gone more slowly. The schedule may suffer as well. Overall, I find the benefits 

Project Managers at Work
229
of letting people go their own way is well worth it. I don’t want to tell people 
how to do their job, for the most part.
Harpham: How do you deal with third parties on project, such as outside 
vendors?
Gillespie: I believe the authority to do project work is granted by the project 
sponsor to the project manager. A vendor may have a contract with the 
organization. However, that contract may not spell out expectations for the 
project specifically. In any case, I may look to the contract for agreed upon 
SLAs [service-level agreements] so that I can understand what the vendor is 
expected to do. For example, I will push to have access to senior technical 
staff from the vendor’s side in case we need assistance or need to escalate an 
issue.
I will then analyze the agreements and vendor documentation along with 
my authority as the project manager. Then I can put the vendor into my 
framework and understand what the vendor's expectations. Fortunately, I 
haven’t had many problems with third parties over my career so far. Reading 
and understanding the contract or other written agreements is critical. That 
information informs what you can and cannot expect from the vendor.
In terms of day-to-day work, I treat vendors like they are part of the team. 
Only in the worst case will I have to investigate the relationship in greater 
depth to understand penalties and similar clauses related to the SLA. In the 
event of a serious problem, it is important to keep calm, seek advice from a 
trusted colleague, and work through the situation.
Harpham: Let’s turn to your PhD. What was your focus of your PhD research? 
How does that connect with project work?
Gillespie: Let me put that in context of the other educational activities so that 
you can understand where I’m coming from. I started by obtaining a certificate 
in project management from Berkeley. Next, I earned the PMP certification 
from PMI [Project Management Institute]. Later on, I took on an MBA degree 
specialization in technology management and several other certifications along 
the way, such as ITIL and the PMI Agile Certified Practitioner.
I was very interested in conducting in-depth research through my PhD. Earning 
the degree ultimately took around eight years. It was a long and drawn-out 
process. It was a significant investment of time and energy. I don’t encourage 
people starting out in project management to obtain a PhD degree, unless 
they are gluttons for punishment. For me, it was a personal goal. I wanted to do 
research and expand the body of knowledge in my field. I do see application 
in the workplace from my research. My communication has become more 
strategic and I have unique and valuable insight into evidence-based management 
that few others have. My PhD was in organization and management, with an 
emphasis in information technology management.

Chapter 19 | Seth J. Gillespie, Senior Project Manager, Apple
230
For most people interested in project management, a MBA or a master’s 
degree would likely be the best terminal degree. I would also highly encourage 
project managers to earn the PMP certification, or if just starting out, the 
CAPM [Certified Associate in Project Management]. Even a few years ago, 
there were not many master’s degrees available in project management. Now 
there are many choices and good schools to choose from.
Harpham: Tell me more about your research focus in your PhD.
Gillespie: It was a correlational study of risk management and its impact on 
information technology project success. I surveyed approximately one hundred 
project managers regarding a specific project they choose to comment on. 
In the survey, I asked them which risk management techniques they used 
on their project and how successful their project was. Success was measured 
in terms of achieving their specified scope, schedule, and budget.
Next, I did a statistical analysis to learn about the correlation between 
using various risk management techniques and whether or not the project 
was successful. Based on this research, I’ve done presentations and several 
publications, including a book, Risk Management: An Enterprise Dilemma [DBC 
Publishing, 2016]. All of my results are in Chapter 4 of the book, as well as a 
follow-up discussion. I think the book is an excellent read and a good investment 
for its price.
Harpham: Based on your research, what works in risk management on 
projects?
Gillespie: In my experience and research, project risk management practices 
are often done informally or not at all. Risk management mitigation, budgeting 
for risk, and analyzing positive and negative risk in advance of a project’s 
execution phase are rare. The study showed that project managers who 
used risk management techniques were correlated to higher levels of project 
success. I advocate using project risk management in the planning phase—
even more so than in the execution phase of the project, where it is often too 
late to migrate your most important risks.
Harpham: If this approach to risk management contributes to success, why 
do you think it is done so rarely?
Gillespie: It’s not well understood as a practice. Organizations don’t tend to 
promote or encourage it. Other project managers do not tend to showcase it 
either. A failure in mentorship may be part of the story. In the PMBOK Guide, 
let’s remember that risk management is only one of several knowledge areas. 
If you’re a brand-new project manager, are you going to dig into that area 
when other areas appear to be more exciting?

Aside from certain industries, like banking and construction, I see an 
organizational aversion to doing risk management. That aversion is likely 
because risk management has not been proven to be beneficial and relevant 
to a particular company. Risk management also identifies weaknesses. Who 
wants to reveal or identify their problems or that they’re underprepared for 
a potential problem?
Harpham: What are the methods and techniques that go into your personal 
productivity system?
Gillespie: Meeting notes are a key activity for me. For every meeting that I 
hold, I send out an email of the notes for the meeting within about an hour 
after the meeting. That holds true whether I have one or five meetings a day. 
In today’s environment, if I wait a day or two to send out the meeting notes, 
there could be other meetings going on that change the discussion or action 
items. This is an insight I’ve developed over time.
When I say “meeting notes,” I mean meeting minutes, like action items—tasks 
with a responsible person and a due date. I also include a high-level summary 
of the issues discussed in the meeting. “Meeting minutes” sounds so formal and 
dry. That’s why over the years my colleagues and I have called them “meeting 
notes,” but they are essentially the same thing. However, I would say that, as 
a best practice, you don’t have to be chronological in the “he said, she said.” 
Rather, be topic driven and action-item focused.
In terms of communication, I think it is best to send out your meeting notes 
in your first post-meeting communication, rather than saying, “Thank you for 
attending the meeting. The minutes will be sent out shortly.”
When you make a promise like that, it often sets you up for failure and 
sometimes there are delays that will prevent you from doing that. It’s better 
to set a personal deadline and get it done, that way, the first thing they get 
from you is an actionable communication.
Turning to email, I’m a strong believer in getting email to “inbox zero.” I don’t 
use email as a task manager which means that I try not to keep an email in 
my inbox as a way to remind me to do something, since this does not scale 
for the work that I do. I know some people—more than a few— that use that 
approach for email. They often have elaborate folders and rules to manage 
the information—so it can be done. I generally prefer to manage tasks in a 
spreadsheet with multiple tabs, organized just the way I like it. That way, 
I don’t have to fight with folders and I can add additional context, status, or 
other notes to a task, such as a due date. Any input I receive from email, or 
other means, needs to be distilled and analyzed for action. It can’t just sit in my 
email inbox. But that’s my own method.

Chapter 19 | Seth J. Gillespie, Senior Project Manager, Apple
232
Finally, I keep an ongoing PowerPoint file for all of my projects. I have a set of 
slides that I keep for myself that makes sense to me. This material helps me to 
quickly prepare for presentations, written, verbal, and ad hoc communication 
on each project. I know that there are great software tools to help with these 
processes. However, when it comes to generating material and maintaining my 
own sanity, I prefer to use spreadsheets and presentation files.
Harpham: There’s value in using tools that you know and understand well. 
It’s not always necessary or helpful to use new software.
Looking ahead over the next few years, which technologies and trends are you 
following with interest?
Gillespie: Waterfall project management is on the decline. It’s not going 
away, because it does fit with certain cases. I see a greater interest in moving 
toward scrum and agile methods though some argue that agile is being taken 
to an extreme. For example, SAFe [Scaled Agile Framework], has its own 
unique challenges. Today, the PMBOK is mainly focused on waterfall project 
management. PMI does have an agile certification, but it is still relatively new. 
But I expect that it will become more popular over time.
Chapter Summary
• 
Recommended books include Gillespie’s Risk Management: 
An Enterprise Dilemma.
• 
Generating career opportunities: Gillespie attributes 
some of his career opportunities to raising his profile 
through speaking engagements and volunteer work.
• 
Transition to project management: Gillespie moved into 
the project field after delivering great results in IT and data 
centers. Despite that success, adjusting to the demands 
of full-time project management took some time.
• 
The art and science of project management: In Gillespie’s 
view, a successful project manager needs to combine the 
“science” of project work (e.g., schedules and budgets) 
with the “art” of project work (e.g., leadership, empathy, 
and communication skills).

• 
Risk management: Aside from a handful of industries, 
Gillespie has found that risk management practices are 
often poorly developed. This presents an opportunity for 
project managers with strong risk skills to add value.
• 
Continuing education: Gillespie has developed his 
knowledge and capabilities through extensive education, 
including earning an MBA, a PhD, and numerous 
professional certifications.

Manager, Brookhaven Site Office, Brookhaven 
National Laboratory
Frank Crescenzo is the manager of the Brookhaven Site Office at Brookhaven 
National Laboratory (BNL) in Upton, New York. He is a federal employee and 
member of the Senior Executive Service (SES) with the US Department of Energy 
(DOE). Crescenzo was appointed site office manager in February 2013. He is also 
responsible for the DOE’s management and operating (M&O) prime contract to 
assure all activities at BNL are completed to DOE expectations.
Crescenzo has 37 years of experience performing and managing technical activities 
and personnel, including 27 years managing the prime contract for operation of 
BNL, 6 years regulating commercial nuclear power reactors, and 4 years managing 
overhaul and testing programs for US Navy nuclear reactors. He was the DOE’s 
federal project director for the NSLS-II project, from shortly after approval of mission 
need in 2005 through approval of project completion in 2015. Concurrent with these 
duties, Crescenzo was also the site office manager at the Princeton Plasma Physics 
Laboratory from October 2014 through December 2015. From 1990 until February 
2013, he was the Brookhaven deputy site office manager; for nearly four of those 
years, he also served as acting site office manager. Throughout his tenure with DOE, 
Crescenzo was responsible for the delivery of many capital projects, including new 
scientific facilities, infrastructure projects, and environmental cleanup projects at BNL.
In the 1980s, Crescenzo served with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. From 
1980 until 1984, he served with the Department of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, 
as a nuclear test engineer. He was responsible for planning and execution of nuclear 
plant overhaul and testing programs for naval nuclear submarines.

Note: The statements, opinions, and recollections expressed by Mr. Crescenzo for this 
book are solely his and not those of the Department of Energy, its Office of Science, 
or the Brookhaven Site Office. Furthermore, Mr. Crescenzo’s participation with this 
publication is not an official governmental endorsement of this book.
Bruce Harpham: What is the focus of your current role?
Frank Crescenzo: I am the site manager for Brookhaven National Lab, a 
US Department of Energy–owned lab located on Long Island, in New York 
State. The Lab is 5,300 acres in size with about 2,700 scientists, engineers, 
technicians, and support personnel performing scientific research and related 
activities. In addition, thousands of scientists from around the world visit BNL 
each year to use one of the many scientific “user” facilities located at BNL. 
Excepting the visiting scientists, almost all personnel at BNL are contractors to 
DOE employed by Brookhaven Science Associates [BSA]. I, along with my site 
office of about thirty-five personnel, manage the DOE’s prime management 
and operating contract with BSA. The contractor’s responsibility is to do all 
the work required to keep the Lab running effectively. The value of the M&O 
contract for BNL is about $600 million per year.
The Lab’s scientific user facilities include the only collider in North America, 
one of only two in the world [the other being the Large Hadron Collider 
in Europe], a multi-function center for nanoscience, a computational science 
facility, and a few small, specialized particle accelerator facilities. The Lab 
also has a newly completed synchrotron radiation facility known as National 
Synchrotron Light Source II [NSLS-II]. I served as the federal project director 
in creating the NSLS-II.
The Brookhaven National Lab is part of a national network of government-
owned contractor operated [GOCO] labs. The Department of Energy 
has responsibility for seventeen national labs across the country. Some of 
these labs, like BNL, are multi-program labs performing research across a 
wide variety of topical areas with multiple scientific facilities. Others have a 
singular scientific focus, such as on high-energy physics, plasma physics [fusion 
energy], or nuclear physics. Still other labs are both multi-program but have 
a large mission to support nuclear security research. In many cases, the labs 
collaborate with each other or with industry and academia to accomplish 
goals or to complete capital projects.

Harpham: What type of scientific work is done at the Brookhaven facility?
Crescenzo: Brookhaven’s principle mission is to design, build, and operate 
large complex and unique scientific facilities for the broader science 
communities of users, which include scientists from BNL. The Brookhaven 
facilities are focused mostly on basic science, but in some instances, like at 
NSLS-II, can have applied focus. By basic, I mean “fundamental” or distinct from 
applied science. An applied science question might be: How do we make a 
better battery? A basic science question might be: What did the universe look 
like a fraction of a moment after the Big Bang? At Brookhaven, we can actually 
re-create the state of the universe at that early moment using our collider, 
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider [RHIC]. There’s also a large and important 
portfolio of applied science work done here as well, but in terms of dollars 
spent, the majority supports basic science.
The Department of Energy’s Office of Science has several scientific programs 
in different areas. These programs support research activities at the national 
labs, at or with universities and in some cases at overseas facilities. Some 
are focused on basic energy science—materials, condensed matter physics, 
chemistry and related points. Basic energy sciences are a major area of work 
at Brookhaven, and support the operation of NSLS-II and the nanoscience 
facility. Nuclear and high-energy physics programs support the RHIC facility. 
Another DOE program supports research into advanced scientific computing 
technologies and strategies. Other programs support fusion energy and 
research on biological and environmental questions as these relate to energy. 
Typically, a science program’s budget will support research activities, operation 
of research facilities and construction of new facilities.
The National Synchrotron Light Source II [NSLS-II] is akin to a gigantic 
microscope: it creates and stores a current of electrons, which emit beams 
of light mostly in the X-ray range of the spectrum. These X-ray beams then 
illuminate samples of matter, which supports investigating and analyzing various 
phenomena. This facility can be used for energy research, biology research, 
chemistry, and many other types of scientific investigation. Just about every 
basic science—and many applied science areas—can use the NSLS-II facility 
for research.
In many cases, the areas of focus for a national lab are driven by the scientific 
facilities that are available at that location. You might ask why the federal 
government is investing resources into scientific research programs and 
facilities. The short answer is that the government is the only organization 
with the resources to fund and operate large, complex scientific facilities 
with purely scientific value. Private industry will generally not build these 
facilities, as there is inadequate financial return on investment. Universities 
typically don’t have the resources to build and operate facilities like these. It’s 
important to note that there is usually a large yearly operating expense that, 

Chapter 20 | Frank Crescenzo, Manager, Brookhaven Site Office, Brookhaven  
                                                     National Laboratory
238
over a facility’s life cycle, which can exceed thirty years, often far exceeds the 
initial construction costs. Building a facility like NSLS-II requires is a long term 
commitment of resources.
Harpham: I’m curious to understand how you came to have these 
responsibilities. How did you get started in your career before you were 
running National Labs?
Crescenzo: I graduated from college with an industrial engineering degree 
in 1980. My first job was in the nuclear industry as a civilian in the US Navy’s 
Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia. It was a very interesting job! 
At that time, I was often working seven days a week for months on end. At 
Norfolk, my focus was on testing nuclear submarines. The submarines would 
come into the shipyard and they would be serviced or upgraded. My role was 
to ensure that the nuclear steam supply equipment was properly operated and 
maintained and that all the systems were correctly tested to assure correct 
operability afterwards.
After three to four years at Norfolk, I went to work for the US Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission [NRC]. The NRC is a government agency that is 
best known for regulating commercial nuclear power plants. In order to 
manipulate or direct the controls on a nuclear power plant in the United 
States, an individual has to obtain and maintain a license from the Commission. 
During my time there, I administered tests to applicants for these licenses 
to operate nuclear facilities. Following that, I was a senior resident inspector 
assigned to represent the NRC at commercial nuclear facilities on Long Island 
and in Westchester County, New York. During this time, I also went to night 
school to earn a law degree.
Harpham: Why did you decide to pursue a law degree?
Crescenzo: In the late 1980s, I was thinking that I might like to be a lawyer. It 
was a great experience to study the law and I enjoyed the curriculum. I found 
the material intellectually manageable. The greater challenge was the physical 
aspect. Working all day and then going to school at night for nine to twelve 
credits a semester is strenuous. I graduated from law school but never ended 
up practicing law.
I came to Brookhaven in 1990 while I was earning the law degree. Soon after 
moving here, I became the deputy site manager in early 1991. It was similar to 
the job I have now except then I was the number-two person. The 1990s were 
a very different time compared to today for the labs. There was a major effort 
that was begun at that time to improve safety, business, and environmental 
management, so it was a bit of a transitional era. That effort has continued 
until today. However, safety and environmental management are now top 
priorities engrained into the culture of BNL. At any given time, there are a 
number of such projects underway at a national lab.

Project Managers at Work
239
Harpham: Would these projects include building large scientific instruments?
Crescenzo: Exactly, that’s one example. Since I’ve been here, I’ve been 
involved in a number of projects. Around the time I joined the DOE at BNL, 
the effort to build the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider had begun. In today’s 
dollars, that project was about $1.5 billion to carry out [at the time, it was 
approximately $750 million]. I wasn’t the project director for that project but 
I was responsible for it. I had a federal project director [FPD] who worked for 
me on that project.
The DOE requires that every capital project over $5 million have a certified 
FPD assigned to it. An FPD is always a federal employee and is overall 
responsible to the project sponsor for project delivery. The FPD leads an 
integrated project team consisting of other federal employees and contractors 
to manage the project planning and execution phases. DOE maintains a robust 
and disciplined training and certification program for FPDs. An FPD is certified 
and assigned to projects by DOE to levels I through IV commensurate with his 
or her training and experience related to project management.
Harpham: Can you elaborate on the environmental projects?
Crescenzo: We had a large environmental cleanup project starting in 
the 1990s and extending until about 2012. Recall the history of this site - 
government operations on the property that became Brookhaven Lab in 1947 
dates back to the Army’s Camp Upton and the First World War.
Up until the 1970s, laws and standards for environmental protection were 
limited. A lack of knowledge concerning the effects of environmental actions 
or inactions resulted in past practices in industry and at government facilities 
that would not be tolerated today. Facilities for treatment of hazardous materials 
did not exist and waste streams considered hazardous and highly regulated 
today, were commonly disposed of in onsite landfills or discharged to surface 
or groundwater bodies around the site. For example, the Army cleaned its 
trucks with volatile organic cleaning fluids and allowed the runoff to collect 
in the groundwater which created plumes. Mercury, a common element in 
research, was typically dumped into drains, ultimately finding its way through 
the sewage treatment plant to a sensitive river that runs through BNL 
property. There were also cases of radioactive materials from BNL’s reactors 
getting into the soils and groundwater.
Starting in the 1990s, there were a number of projects to stop further releases 
and to clean up legacy impacts in the soils, groundwater, and rivers at BNL. 
The cleanup effort took a number of years with a budget over $500 million. It 
was one of Brookhaven’s larger projects and it had nothing to do with science. 
It was a highly structured project that used earned value management, project 
reviews, and other processes.

                                                     National Laboratory

In addition to the major projects to create new scientific instruments, there 
are a number of other projects underway at Brookhaven at any given time. 
For example, a building may be under construction, another building being 
demolished, or an existing science facility may be installing a new instrument. 
Brookhaven also has ongoing projects to support other labs, including a very 
large neutrino experiment in Illinois and South Dakota, a large digital telescope 
being constructed in Chile, and a $300 million upgrade to a detector at the 
Large Hadron Collider in Europe.
Harpham: What was the origin of the NSLS II project?
Crescenzo: Creating a large scientific facility like NSLS II takes a great deal of 
time and resources. Typically, people start thinking about the project around 
fifteen to twenty years before it is finished and operational. People start to 
ask questions like, “What kind of scientific research capabilities will we need 
in five or ten or twenty years?” I personally recall first hearing about a next-
generation light source for BNL sometime in the late 1990s.
Harpham: In brief, what was the objective and rationale for the NSLS II 
project?
Crescenzo: In the late 1990s, there was a realization that the synchrotron 
radiation facility at BNL was getting old. It was understood that a new 
instrument would be needed to support the large number of synchrotron 
science users at BNL and to a certain extent in the Northeast. At the same 
time, other questions come up concerning budget matters and timing. When 
could it be done? These early steps of developing the idea at a high level didn’t 
involve me given the role I have. These are planning activities that are reserved 
for the program officials I spoke of earlier.
Generally, the Department of Energy’s science program budget and priorities 
are divided into three areas. These include a budget to support research at 
national labs and academia, a budget to support operating existing research 
facilities, and a budget to support building brand-new facilities. Determining 
when and how to fund a large project like the NSLS II from the “build new 
facilities” budget is challenging in part because the decision makers have to 
be mindful of all the other programs and projects in their portfolio. Typically, 
funds become available for new projects as other projects are completed. New 
operating funds become available as older facilities phase out or shutdown.
As you can imagine, the early thinking about such projects tends to be informal 
and ranging in scope and costs. Many people come to the table with ideas for 
scientific research. With NSLS II, informal support for the project really began 
around 2003 with formal DOE support via the Critical Decision process 
starting in 2005 and substantial financial support from DOE starting in 2007.

Project Managers at Work
241
Harpham: What is the Critical Decisions process?
Crescenzo: On any large project [and some other projects], there are 
certain “critical decisions” to be made. On each project, there’s usually five 
pre-defined critical decisions.
The first critical decision [Critical Decision 0] involves the mission need - 
the sponsor has to make a decision or a declaration for the mission. For 
a DOE science program, this is typically described in terms of a scientific 
capability. The particular mission need that spawned the NSLS-II was the need 
to “image materials at the single atom scale.” Critical Decision 0 for NSLS-II 
was completed in August 2005. You can consider that moment as the formal 
beginning of the project. I became the federal project director shortly after 
Critical Decision 0.
The next step–Critical Decision 1—is to answer the question: how do we best 
satisfy the mission need? Specifically, we start to create conceptual designs 
showing different ways to fulfill the need. Several options were considered 
at this stage, including building a brand-new facility, upgrading an existing 
domestic facility, utilizing an overseas facility and, as always, a “do nothing” 
option. Critical Decision 1 also authorizes financial support for preliminary 
design efforts.
The next Critical Decision, 2, to approve a baseline, locks in the cost, scope, 
and schedule for the project. This is followed by a Critical Decision 3, which 
authorizes physical construction to begin. Lastly, there is a Critical Decision 4, 
which signals project completion and authorizes the facility to begin operations.
Harpham: It’s interesting to see that choosing an international facility to 
carry out the scientific mission is one of the options.
Crescenzo: Absolutely. Every year, there are more and more great scientific 
facilities established around the world. If there is a great facility in Japan or 
Europe we could partner with, that might be a great option to achieve the 
mission. Every scientific field has its own community. The nuclear physicists 
from around the world know each other, for example. They all keep informed 
on what facilities are available and what questions would be worthwhile to 
explore next. Generally, any scientific community will have many more science 
questions and new facilities in mind than there are resources to pursue them. 
So, they have to prioritize and they try to avoid duplicating facilities.
In many cases, it quickly becomes obvious that you need to build a new facility 
to achieve the scientific mission. Unlike some highly specialized facilities 
designed to answer narrow questions, light sources are workhorse science 
facilities servicing a very broad user community. The United States operates 
five and just about every major nation has at least one with more under 
construction, all oversubscribed by users. You almost can’t have too many 
Light Sources [if you could afford them]. However, it’s important to go through 

Chapter 20 | Frank Crescenzo, Manager, Brookhaven Site Office, Brookhaven  
                                                     National Laboratory
242
the exercise of generating a variety of options to meet the mission need and 
giving each option careful consideration. If that work on defining and analyzing 
options for the project is skipped, you might fall into the situation where you 
build the project just because somebody asked for it. You may end up with the 
proverbial “white elephant” that nobody really needs or wants. That wasteful 
scenario can be prevented by using this type of options analysis.
Harpham: What was the next step in the project’s development?
Crescenzo: In 2007, we went through Critical Decision 1. That’s when we 
decided that building the NSLS-II would be the best way to fulfill the mission 
need to image materials at the single atom scale. At that time, the high-level 
specifications were also created and design funds were released to the project.
The federal project director role means that I am the senior federal person 
on site with the project. In this case, I was managing the project through the 
contractor.
Harpham: In your capacity as the federal project director, what kinds of 
decisions come across your desk?
Crescenzo: For example, I would authorize the use of contingency funds 
on the project. If the project encounters a cost that was higher than planned 
[or if it will take longer than planned], those decisions would come to me 
for a final decision. I would also make decisions regarding scope changes on 
the project. For example, just before we started physical construction of the 
building to house the NSLS-II, we realized the experimental floor would be 
very cramped so we decided to broaden it about 10 meters. Sounds simple 
but it’s a round building so it was 10 meters wide by 800 meters round. It 
cost about 12 million extra so I had to approve this scope change and release 
contingency funds to pay for it.
In many cases, the contractor would have the authority to make some of 
these decisions. In this arrangement, significant authority was delegated to 
the contractor to make smaller changes. However, very large changes might 
have to go to my customer for a decision. If the change was very, very large 
then that change might be brought to the Secretary of Energy. In this project, 
there was no need to contact the Secretary, but it could have happened. Some 
situations—known as a “baseline breach”—may call for the Secretary to get 
involved as well.
Harpham: Do “baseline breaches” on the project happen often?
Crescenzo: My working definition of a project breach is where the cost or 
schedule is projected to significantly exceed the approved baseline considering 
contingencies or the baseline scope cannot be delivered. The NSLS-II never 
approached a baseline breach situation. It happens fairly frequently in other 
projects. For example, some projects have enormous technical challenges 
that cannot be solved as initially planned, often funding profile changes cause 

Project Managers at Work
243
progress to slow and total costs to skyrocket, and sometimes, unforeseen 
challenges emerge. These situations can have enormous impacts on project 
cost and schedules. In my experience, it’s more often than not that a project 
breach is caused by forces external to the project. To the extent that a  
project team is responsible for a breach, it is usually because it failed to plan 
for risks properly. NSLS-II was a very successful project. We didn’t encounter 
these types of problems.
Harpham: It sounds like Light Source II was a near perfect project. It was 
delivered on time and on budget. That’s an impressive accomplishment given 
the complexity of the project. How was that achieved?
Crescenzo: We had an excellent customer or sponsor to work with on the 
project. For NSLS II our sponsor was the DOE’s Office of Science program 
for Basic Energy Sciences [SC-BES]. If you study projects enough, you will find 
that the customer’s involvement [or lack thereof] is extremely important to 
the project’s success—or failure. A good project customer is someone who is 
interested, engaged, and committed to success on the project. They will give 
you the resources required to achieve the objective. They will understand that 
risks are part of the project and will provide resources to cover risks. Finally, a 
good customer will also hold you accountable to deliver the project.
If the customer doesn’t hold you accountable to deliver the project, problems 
tend to linger and don’t get solved. Here again, we had an exceptionally good 
customer: Basic Energy Sciences at the Department of Energy.
We also had a great project team. The project leadership was exceptionally 
good at leading but also in the “business” of project management. Below the 
leadership the technical staff, the scientists and engineers, who designed and 
built the machine were among the best in the world. There were countless 
technical challenges on this project and the technical team overcame them all.
Lastly we had a great project baseline and plan to deliver the project. We 
understood the risks involved in the project and could plan accordingly. Every 
day brought a new problem, but we mostly anticipated these problems through 
risk management and worked through those problems, such as problems with 
vendors. At the end of the day, we were able to solve the problems by using 
additional staff, money, or other approaches. Our solutions always were well 
within our contingencies.
Harpham: The role of the customer is a great perspective to highlight. Some 
explanations of project success or failure put all pressure on the project 
manager’s side of the desk. Can you give examples of actions the customer did 
that made you think, “We’re going to win because we have a good customer 
helping us!”

Crescenzo: We had a good funding package to build this project as a 
starting point. I’ve been involved in other projects where the customer was 
not interested in success per se. In those cases, it seemed like the customer 
was more interested in looking successful. In the latter case of “looking 
successful,” the customer would dictate the budget and project deadline. If 
the team pointed out that the project will take longer or cost more, this kind 
of customer would respond with “That’s the wrong answer!” In that case, the 
project will be destined to fail.
Harpham: What was your approach to planning the project with the 
customer?
Crescenzo: It’s important to go through the pre-planning stage to achieve 
success. Our customer was engaged with us during the planning work. I would 
talk with my program manager almost daily though this time. My program 
manager, a member of my integrated project team, was located in headquarters 
and worked in the sponsor organization [SC-BES]. Typically, the program 
manager would monitor my performance and my contractor’s performance on 
the project and communicate this to his superiors. He also assisted the project 
by attending to HQ tasks, such as budget issues or handling project-directed 
inquiries from external entities. That’s another example of the customer being 
committed to true success rather than simply looking successful.
Harpham: Can you explain more about the difference between a project 
customer who’s interested in success and one who is interested in appearing 
successful?
Crescenzo: The good customer has to be committed to provide the 
resources for the project to be successful. The customer has to be engaged 
and knowledgeable enough to effectively hold the project team accountable 
for results. The customer has to be prepared for and understand the nature of 
project work: uncertainty, risk, and changes to cost and schedule. The customer 
has to be willing to accept project changes as they occur. At the same time, 
it’s my job to stay on top of the contractor and ensure that they are delivering 
according to plans, considering risks and contingencies. In this case, everyone 
was comfortable with the project baseline in terms of budget and schedule. 
Creating that baseline and obtaining agreement on it was Critical Decision 2 
with our process.
In contrast, a not so good customer might force a contractor to agree to a 
baseline that the contractor does not believe is credible. The customer will 
declare that the project will be successful because it will be delivered at such 
and so time for some cost that they can afford—i.e., it looks successful now. 
Often these customers will rotate folks through the project, so they fail to 
remain adequately engaged. As these project execute, they run over budget 
and schedule, create crisis, then the customer throws the contractor under 
the bus for failing to deliver.

Harpham: What was the next important point on the project?
Crescenzo: In 2009, we arrived at Critical Decision 3 on the project. It 
happened to occur right at the same time as the 2008 to 2009 economic 
crisis. The conventional construction market collapsed in terms of demand. 
That construction market collapse had a two-fold impact on the project.
First, we went out for bids for the buildings and related items [conventional 
construction]. Generally, with projects like the NSLS-II, scientists design the 
machine they want and an external civil construction design firm or architect 
engineer is contracted to design a new custom building to house the machine. 
Often the building, or “conventional construction,” is on or near the critical 
path and must get started first or very early on the project schedule. In 
many past projects, the bids for conventional construction would come in 
much higher than expected causing baseline problems at the very start of 
construction. This was a large risk for the NSLS-II. However, the economic 
situation contributed to the outcome that bids came in at great prices—right 
on target with what we had planned. This allowed us to retire a large risk on 
the project early.
Second, in response to the so-called great recession, the federal government, 
through its “stimulus” program released a large amount of funding for “shovel 
ready” projects to stimulate the economy in 2009. Originally, NSLS-II was 
to receive about $103 million in 2009 to get started with construction. The 
stimulus program accelerated an additional $150 million in fiscal year 2009 
to our project, so we ended up with a total of about $253 million in 2009. 
It is important to note that this $150 million was accelerated funding, not 
additional funding. The total project cost in the approved baseline did not 
increase above the original $912 million. Rather, the $150 million added 
to 2009 was subtracted from later year budgets in the project’s multi-year 
funding profile.
With those resources available at an earlier point, we were able to solve some 
of the technical risks in the project and accelerate the project’s completion. 
Overall, this added funding made it possible for us to reduce risk on the 
project and facilitate the opportunities to add scope to the project.
Harpham: After Critical Decision 3 in 2009, what was the next significant 
point in the project?
Crescenzo: We had Critical Decision 4 next. At this point, the buildings, 
instruments and everything requested was delivered. We demonstrated that 
the facility and instruments were fully functional to complete the project in 
December 2014.
Harpham: It looks like you had excellent opportunities in terms of 
government spending and an oversupply in construction capacity to move the 
project ahead quickly.

Harpham: What do you mean that you used some of the budget to “buy 
down risk”? Can you describe that in further detail?
Crescenzo: An enormously important question in a federally funded project 
is how much money do you have each year to spend?
Practically, if a project’s schedule is “funding limited” that means its progress 
will be determined by how much funding is available to commit over the life 
of the project. The project will need to defer work and procurements to later 
points on the project schedule when funding is available.
On the other hand, a project schedule can be “technically limited” meaning 
progress will be determined by how fast work can be done in the most 
optimal schedule. Any given task has a limit on how fast it can be done and 
cannot be accelerated even with unlimited money. It may take a vendor a year 
to make a thousand magnets or an engineer a certain period of time to design 
a structure. In almost all cases, a funding limited project will take longer and 
cost more in the end than a technically limited project.
This concept is particularly important for federally funded projects, as US 
government budgets are approved annually. A federal project sponsor may 
need to limit a project’s funding in a given year to less than optimal in order 
to fulfill commitments elsewhere in its program. While a program can plan on 
a future funding profile, it’s not certain until the annual budget is enacted into 
law. The annual budget process can change the funding from the baseline plan 
in a particular year.
The possibility that the funding profile would be “stretched” on NSLS-II was 
the single largest risk that we carried for most of the project’s life. Thankfully, 
it was never realized. Most large projects that I’ve been involved with are 
funding, or close to funding limited. NSLS-II was an exception, the acceleration 
of the $150 million essentially shifted the schedule from near funding limited 
to technically limited. With this accelerated funding, we actually had more 
money on hand than we could spend for the first few years of construction. 
This is a very rare circumstance in government projects.
Any part of the technical scope may carry risk. For example, the vendor may be 
late in delivering to the project. With the added budget we were given, it was 
possible to bring some of the technical scope earlier in the schedule than we 
had originally planned. Completing those technical components earlier meant 
there was a reduced need to hold a portion of money for risk management.
Let’s say you had originally planned to do certain project work five years 
from now. Then, you are able to make changes and start on that project work 
tomorrow. It changes everything. You have the capacity to get started on 
something else earlier. We were able to add additional scope that wasn’t in 
the initial baseline.

Project Managers at Work
247
Harpham: Did adding scope to the project prompt questions or objections?
Crescenzo: No, this was not a gold plating scenario. With NSLS-II, we were 
able to accelerate the project’s progress as additional resources became 
available. The facility was originally designed to ultimately have sixty-five 
beamlines and five lab office buildings [LOBs].
A beamline is a scientific instrument where the visiting scientists illuminate 
their samples, the working end of the facility so to speak. An LOB has office 
and lab space to support thousands of scientist users who would visit the 
facility to use the beamlines. As a reference, a state of the art beamline might 
cost $20 to $25 million and a fully built out LOB $15 million. The initial 
baseline plan was to build six beamlines, two fully fitted-out LOBs, and one 
“shell” LOB [walls, roof, HVAC]. This approach—to deliver partial capability 
on day one with the intent to add capability later—is very common on 
DOE science facility projects. As risks were retired, and we saw a funding 
opportunity, we were able to finish the LOB shell and add two more shells. 
We added significant parts to the technical scope to facilitate future beamline 
construction. Again, everything we added was envisioned within the end state 
facility design approved with Critical Decision 1. Therefore, these additions 
cannot be termed gold plating.
In contrast, gold plating on the project would look quite different. That 
would be something like: “We’re going to add something that will significantly 
increase or change the capability envisioned in the original design or possibly 
to build an unrelated or ancillary facility somewhere else nearby.” Again, for 
NSLS-II we were simply building out the original design more quickly.
Harpham: So the scientists were pleasantly surprised when they heard 
about the expanded facilities?
Crescenzo: The sponsor was happy about the progress. And in general, the 
sponsor represents the scientific community of users.
The actual scientists were focused on different capabilities. The stakeholders 
interested in the beamlines include physicists, chemists, environmental 
specialists and many other professions. At Brookhaven, it’s a diverse community 
of different researchers and scientists as opposed to a facility specialized in a 
specific area, such as nuclear research. The scientists knew they were going 
to receive a certain capacity and simply wanted it to be available for use. I am 
sure that in the end everyone with a stake in NSLS-II will be more pleased 
with the extra scope we delivered from what we planned to deliver initially.
Harpham: I’m curious to understand the project chronology. When was 
construction completed on the project?
Crescenzo: Construction was ultimately completed in 2014.
Harpham: What are some of your lessons learned from your role in the 
Light Source II project?

248
Crescenzo: A key lesson for me is that many of the non-technical problems 
ultimately stem from communications. There were a lot of communication 
problems between those doing the project work, my office, and the customer. 
One of my biggest contributions to the project was to raise the quality 
and accuracy of project communications. Certainly, bad news is bad news. 
However, I hate surprises on a project. If there was bad news, it should not 
come as a total surprise. Also, the customer doesn’t want surprises either. If 
I suspected a problem might develop, I would provide early warning about 
those situations.
I also learned lessons about the importance of planning the project well at an 
early stage. That includes defining the risks and establishing a risk management 
plan.
Harpham: Can you illustrate the communication problems you encountered? 
What does that sound like?
Crescenzo: Surprise! If the customer is surprised about an issue or problem, 
it is likely that there was ineffective communication earlier. Sometimes 
communication problems were connected to roles and responsibilities issues. 
For example, you might have the customer telling the contractor how to do 
business. It’s not the customer’s responsibility to tell the contractor how to 
run their business. Instead, the customer’s role is to say, “There is a problem 
here. You need to demonstrate how you will solve the problem.” Ultimately, 
some people would get confused about the boundaries of their role in the 
project and I was often called upon to straighten this out.
Harpham: How can the “Surprise!” situation be prevented? Is it a case of 
project managers delaying saying anything until they have a one hundred–
percent complete picture of a situation?
Crescenzo: There is a tendency for everyone to delay informing others of 
problems until they have complete understanding of the problem or maybe 
the solution to the problem. This approach or philosophy must be avoided at 
all times as it can erode trust.
Let’s say a part of the project suddenly has a cost of $5 million higher than 
what was planned. You will need to inform your customer—hey, it’s $5 million 
more than planned. Once they get over the surprise, the customer may start 
to dig into the situation. If the customer then finds out that you’ve been 
struggling with a vendor for six months and the likelihood of increased cost has 
been discussed for five and a half months you lose the customer’s confidence. 
Finding out such a back-story makes your customer wonder, “What else is 
going on with this project that I don’t know about?” Losing the confidence of 
your customer is very bad for many reasons.

Project Managers at Work
249
You want your customer to know about potential problems even those 
that are on the horizon. When you communicate enough, the customer has 
greater confidence about your approach to problems. They are likely to think, 
“OK, here comes a problem on the project. Nothing unusual about a problem 
happening here. I also know that my project manager has been successful 
at addressing problems in the past and will keep me informed about the 
situation.”
Harpham: It comes down to anticipating problems or spotting early warning 
signs.
Crescenzo: On any given day, there will be problems big and small as you 
work through a project. However, effective project planning means that you 
will anticipate most of the significant problems. For instance, you know for 
certain that some, but not all, of the vendors will be late in their delivery or 
more expensive than planned. You must plan for this risk, partly with mitigation 
strategies, but also with time and money. A well-designed project will carry 
or plan for a lot more risk than ultimately gets realized. For example, you may 
plan for a million dollars’ worth of delays from vendors and some will be late 
and some will be on time, so maybe it costs you only $500,000 to address. 
Now you have $500,000 to apply to other risks, or maybe added scope.
Harpham: What are the upcoming trends and opportunities in the next 
three to five years that you see coming up in science and technology?
Crescenzo: I’m not an expert in predicting the direction of science. I will 
say that there are effective processes in place for the DOE programs to 
communicate with the various scientific communities to develop the strategic 
directions for science and the DOE’s role in those plans. Keep in mind that 
the DOE is the largest funding source of basic scientific research in the United 
States. That means many different scientific projects are explored at any given 
moment. Also, whatever DOE does, or wants to do, will need to be authorized 
by the President and the Congress, and I am certainly no expert on predicting 
the outcome of those processes.
I would like to address a related question as to why should the government 
should support science. Take the Apple iPhone as an example. Some folks 
might say, “Look! What a wonderful high-tech product developed by private 
industry! Who needs the government to fund R&D?” Well, most of the 
foundational technologies [e.g., GPS, Internet, cellular, touch screens, lithium 
ion batteries, LCDs] that went into that product were based on ideas and 
technologies developed at their earliest stages by the public sector’s science 
and technology research. Government funding for basic science, especially 
at the early stages—where the risks are high and the benefits are unclear, 
plays an essential role in furthering our nation’s technology base and in turn 
competitiveness.

Harpham: What does your personal productivity system look like?
Crescenzo: In order to be productive in my decisions, I need to be well 
informed. Therefore, a key practice for me is seeking out information from 
my team and other sources. I also made it a priority to ensure that the right 
people worried about the right issues at the right times. Of course, there are 
many other useful tools to use in projects, such as earned value management. 
However, it’s important to understand the limitations of a given tool. Earned 
value management reports can be misleading.
Harpham: In what way, would earned value management reports mislead a 
project manager?
Crescenzo: Take NSLS-II for example. Early on, we were spending huge 
amounts of money on conventional construction. If you looked at our 
spending versus our planned spending, it was ahead of schedule. However, 
you might have a key vendor who is delivering their important but less 
expensive contribution late. Earned value measures may not take into account 
the importance of small budget items that play a critical role in the project’s 
success. Without those parts, you cannot finish the project. We had that issue 
with certain parts that were difficult to produce. They required absolutely 
clean production conditions and this was a serious challenge for the vendor. 
An earned value or financial report on the project would not clearly identify 
this delay of a lower-cost item as a critical issue.
Earned value management information is useful, but you need to supplement 
it with other resources. An experienced project manager once told me that 
earned value management analysis is “like trying to drive a car by looking 
in the rear-view mirror.” You certainly need to check the rear-view mirror 
periodically to drive safely, but looking forward is more important.
Chapter Summary
• 
The role of the project sponsor in project success: 
Crescenzo attributes much of his success on NSLS II to 
having an excellent customer/sponsor. Such a sponsor 
cares about the project’s success and engage in discussions 
on risk.
• 
Changing the world with projects: NSLS II, an award-
winning project, enables new types of scientific research. 
That research cannot happen, however, unless project 
managers deliver an outstanding facility.

251
• 
Finding opportunities in crisis: NSLS II’s success in terms 
of staying on budget was facilitated by obtaining great 
prices from vendors and accelerated funding during the 
2008–2010 recession. What opportunity can you find in 
your next crisis?
• 
The productive leader: In order to make good decisions 
on your projects, make it a habit to seek out quality 
information in reports and in other resources. Biased 
or incomplete information will quietly sabotage your 
decisions.
• 
Critical decision points: The NSLS II was governed with 
several processes, including a number of “critical decision 
points.” How can you adapt these process and questions 
(e.g., How do we best satisfy the mission’s needs?) to make 
sure that your organization builds the right projects?

industries. Before Accenture, Kollm founded a design and marketing company, whose 
clients included Massachusetts General Hospital and many of Boston’s top law firms. 
Prior to this, he worked in senior product management, project/engineering manage-

(onshore/offshore, multicultural) environments. He also has expertise in bimodal 
development, interfacing agile projects with existing waterfall dependencies.
Bruce Harpham: How did you start your career?
David Kollm: I started my career at NCR as a hardware engineer. While 
in that role, I worked on PC2PC [a 1 megabit local area network], RetailPC 
[NCR’s first PC-based cash register], NCR’s Token Ring LAN board, and 
NCR’s first personal computers targeted at consumers. I worked my way up 
through the various engineering levels and eventually obtained a consulting 
engineer position at NCR. The company decided to move our group from 
Dayton, Ohio, to Minneapolis. This proposed move—to a new location and 
role—was not a good fit for my family as we were expecting our first child, so 
I looked around for other opportunities.

Chapter 21 | David Kollm, Enterprise Agile Coach, Accenture

Ultimately, we moved to South Carolina where I made a lateral move to 
a project integration manager role. I had eleven years of experience as an 
engineer and engineering manager prior to moving over to project integration 
management. That was my first formal introduction to project management. 
While I was in that role, I started an executive MBA degree from Clemson 
University. My goal in achieving my MBA was to learn the “business side” of 
the product development business so that I would be able to understand and 
see the non-technical side of work. My next career move was to product 
management.
Harpham: Why did you move into product management?
Kollm: I wanted to make a bigger impact and contribution to the company. 
As a project manager in that context, I had a limited opportunity to make a 
bigger impact on a product’s vision and roadmap. I was simply expected to 
implement the pre-existing plan. I remember working on one project night 
and day for three months with the project team. The project was to implement 
a local area network. At that year’s Christmas party for the division, the vice 
president of the group gave a glowing speech about a specific product and the 
extra effort put in by its leader to bring it in on time. At first, my project team 
thought the VP was referring to me. As it turned out, the VP was referring to 
the product manager who he called up for additional recognition. This person 
had only visited the engineering team once and didn’t appear to work any 
overtime. Yet, the VP handed him a briefcase full of money at the event. In 
reality, he had never even set foot in our development area or spoken to our 
team. We did all the work and he got all the credit.
Harpham: An actual briefcase filled with cash?
Kollm: Yes, it was briefcase with cash! I’m not sure how much, but it looked 
like a lot. Then another product manager was called up to the stage by the 
VP and received a briefcase of money. At this point, my wife looked at me and 
said, “What do you think about this product manager role and why were they 
being recognized when you and your team did all of the work?” Certainly, the 
product role was attractive in part due to what I saw at that event.
I also realized that I could do a much better job as a product manager—
knowing firsthand the impact and responsibility I would have in leveraging 
a company’s engineering resources. I felt that if product management and 
engineering could work together more closely—instead of just throwing 
specs over the wall—the company would produce better products in shorter 
timeframes with less death march overtime.
Harpham: What was your first year of work in the product field after coming 
up through project and engineering roles?

Project Managers at Work
255
Kollm: In some respects, my technical background was a disadvantage. As a 
product manager, you should be looking at what your customer wants and 
work toward that. That perspective contrasts to an engineering outlook that 
takes technical capabilities as the starting point. It was challenging to take the 
view that I had to set the vision and then challenge the engineering team to 
meet that vision.
Harpham: How did the product management roles unfold?
Kollm: Ultimately, I ended up working in several product management roles at 
NCR, AT&T, and elsewhere. Eventually, my division was acquired by Compaq. 
Unfortunately, we were far from Compaq headquarters, so I felt isolated 
from the company’s management. The company invited us to move to their 
headquarters in Texas. I didn’t want to move there. As a result, I moved to a 
role at Parametric Technology Corporation as a marketing manager. Shortly 
afterward, the dot-com bust hit the technology industry.
Harpham: How did you navigate through the dot-com crash?
Kollm: I worked in various roles in this time, but none of them seemed 
to work out. Eventually, I co-founded a web design and marketing company 
with a focus on serving healthcare and law offices in the Boston area. Within 
three months, I had booked two years’ worth of business and was on the 
qualified vendor list for Massachusetts General Hospital! We delivered over 
fifty external/internal websites along with traditional branding designs—logos, 
stationary, etc.—to Massachusetts General Hospital and multiple large law 
and accounting firms in the Boston area.
Harpham: What did you do after running the business?
Kollm: After running my own business for four to five years, I decided to 
switch back to the employee role. I was surprised to see how much employer 
expectations had changed compared to when I was last an employee. I recall 
interviewing for one job where I thought I was a great fit. Unfortunately, I 
didn’t receive an offer. When I asked why, I was told that they were seeking 
a person with deep project management expertise and my résumé showed 
a combination of project and product experience. As they put it, they didn’t 
want a jack-of-all-trades. I realized that the market had shifted.
Harpham: How did you respond to this shift in the job market?
Kollm: I learned about the Project Management Institute and decided to earn 
the PMP certification. I learned that there was a need to develop your own 
professional brand. It was no longer enough to say that you had successfully 
worked at a Fortune 50 company like NCR. Prior to moving into engineering 
management and product management at NCR, I had achieved the career 
level of consulting engineer. However, that was not enough. Companies do not 
want to take risks when they hire. One way to reduce hiring risk is to look for 
indicators, such as if the person has a PMP certification.

Chapter 21 | David Kollm, Enterprise Agile Coach, Accenture
256
After passing the exam and updating my résumé, I found myself in a project 
management position within two weeks!
Harpham: Earning the PMP certification made a major positive impact on 
your career?
Kollm: Obtaining my PMP had an immediate impact on my career prospects. 
Before I obtained the PMP certification, I secured multiple job offers simply 
by stating that I had taken a PMI PMBOK–based project management course. 
Prior to this, I kept getting passed over for project management positions that 
I was overqualified for.
Harpham: What lessons have you learned along the way on how to navigate 
through large organizations?
Kollm: I recall learning about the importance of transparency and politics 
when I was working at a large insurance company in the Boston area as a 
project manager. The organization had a highly political environment, including 
the IT organization. At one key meeting, a business stakeholder showed that 
he missed all his deadlines for the project; however, he was still expecting IT 
to meet the overall delivery. I called him out saying, “This lack of information is 
putting the project at risk. We can’t move ahead with this level of information 
and support.”
After the meeting, I was called into my boss’s office. I was told off for making 
the business partner look bad in the meeting. I responded by saying, “I just 
reported the project’s status.” There was a subtext: the business partner had 
a higher rank than me and I was criticized for pointing out his shortcomings. 
At that point, I realized that I wanted to move to a different environment.
Harpham: It sounds like the organization was dysfunctional.
Kollm: It was dysfunctional. If you can’t tell the truth at a status meeting, how 
can the organization’s management change course or make good decisions? 
While the company was doing reasonably well, I noticed that they were not 
number one, number two, or even number three in their industry. Their 
dysfunctional corporate culture contributed to reduced performance.
Harpham: I can certainly see the connection. If I’m an executive in this 
organization, this kind of corporate culture may reduce the quality of 
information I receive. Without crucial information, how can I make good 
decisions for the company?
Kollm: You’re one hundred percent right. People wouldn’t speak up when they 
saw problems. There’s the adage that by the time you become an executive, 
all the status reports you receive will be positive. Everybody below you will 
massage information before it reaches you.

Project Managers at Work
257
This reminds me of a recent agile coaching project I led at a large 
telecommunications company. I led an effort to have all the scope systemically 
tracked within our agile project management tool and then review that directly, 
instead of producing and reviewing status reports. However, some managers 
at the company didn’t like this approach because this system exposed that 
they were behind schedule on the project. Transparency cuts both ways. It’s 
better to be transparent than not, but don’t expect everyone to say thank you!
If you think someone is going to be negatively impacted by an upcoming report, 
you may want to proactively offer to help them before the report is released.
I once heard Alastair Cockburn put it this way at an agile seminar: agile is like 
a mirror. It will reveal what’s working and what’s not working very quickly. If 
you move to agile with bad processes, those bad processes will be revealed 
in detail.
Harpham: What do you see happening when organizations adopt agile?
Kollm: I’ve seen companies start to adopt agile and then measure this activity 
with metrics. When they don’t like what the metrics tell them, they change the 
metrics to ones that do. To be fair, they still make some improvements, but 
playing with the metrics slows down progress considerably.
In other companies, there’s a whole different attitude. Management will say, 
“These metrics show we have a major problem. We need to take action 
to address the situation.” As you might expect, this attitude leads to 
faster transitions to agile and increased productivity. Fundamentally, those 
organizations are successful in changing their culture.
Harpham: In your training and consulting activities, what are some of the 
mistakes you see made by novice agile practitioners?
Kollm: Metrics and measures are one of my areas of expertise. I certainly 
see mistakes in that area. In agile, everyone is familiar with story points—a 
way to describe progress on scope. However, the story points are relative and 
based on each team’s progress. Unfortunately, these measures are not well 
understood.
I have seen procurement people write RFPs with statements that define story 
points as a productivity measure. For example, the measure could be “each team 
will deliver fifty story points per month or per sprint.” That procurement wording 
changes them into an absolute measure rendering the use of them useless.
Maintaining story points as a relative measurement of effort is key, because 
in agile, you measure progress in working software per team. The key word 
here is per. Each team understands and completes the needed work at its own 
pace. Keeping this measure relative and at an individual team level provides a 
useful measure of delivery predictability based on past results.

Chapter 21 | David Kollm, Enterprise Agile Coach, Accenture
258
A waterfall project approach assumes all teams are uniform in capability and 
therefore assumes a certain hourly estimate for a type of work that is then 
applied uniformly to all teams doing that type of work. The benefit of keeping 
story points relative is that we get a much more realistic “rate of delivery” of 
work per sprint per team. This rate—the team’s velocity—can then be used 
to more reliably predict when the team will complete its overall set of work. 
This is key because most business partners would rather have predictable 
reliable delivery of work to base their business plans/product launches on.
However, this does not provide a single simple productivity measure for 
procurement. Many times, their position is “we’ll translate a story point into 
a certain number of work hours.” If you do that, the metric is no longer a 
relative measure of effort. As a result, it’s no longer a team measure and it may 
become a death march.
Harpham: Speaking of misunderstanding agile, I sometimes see the term 
“agile” vaguely used to mean “we’ll just go faster,” while leaving our culture 
and processes largely unchanged.
Kollm: Agile is a totally distinct way of working. It is a cultural shift. 
Fundamentally, I see agile adoption as an organizational change management 
project. It is not just a software development methodology. If agile is treated 
like a development framework and its adoption is not extended to the business 
side of a company, it can become a mini-waterfall situation. Even worse, you 
may get “zombie teams.” These are teams with no ownership of their work 
and without any ability to push back on unready work. They’re told what to 
do and they get yelled at for not getting it done, even when it is not their fault.
Adopting agile is not like ordering off a menu in a restaurant—you can’t 
choose item one, item four, and item seven. Agile is an interdependent system 
of processes, measures, and cultural shifts that needs to be adopted fully if you 
want to obtain the benefits.
Harpham: What happens when a waterfall organization attempts to adopt 
agile in a partial way?
Kollm: That happens all the time. You might have this one group that is 
adopting agile processes. However, they may report to a PMO that requires 
traditional project management reporting metrics. As a result, the agile teams 
must do their work in agile and redo everything to satisfy the waterfall 
requirements. Consequentially, the teams get burned out from having to serve 
two different systems. In most cases, the agile experiment collapses and the 
group resumes using the waterfall approach.
At this point in time, waterfall project management is the incumbent 
methodology still used in many organizations. To really get the benefits, 
you can’t run a single agile project and say, “We’re an agile organization.” 
Organizations must continually work on it. If there’s no ongoing effort to 

Project Managers at Work
259
adopt agile—both methods and culture, groups that initially do adopt agile will 
end up like a rock in swift river—worn down over time eventually reverting 
to waterfall because it is the path of least resistance.
When I arrive at companies today, I find that most of them have experimented 
with agile in some form. However, many are still treating agile as strictly an 
engineering/IT activity and haven’t tackled the hard problem of involving the 
business. Because of this they’re not getting the benefits they expected to 
receive.
Harpham: What goes into the agile assessment process you use? Does it 
explore culture and change management?
Kollm: Let’s start with the premise that adopting agile involves an 
organizational change management process. It’s also notable that agile, scrum, 
and related ideas were not created by consulting firms. They had grassroots 
origins from various developers.
Agile and scrum were first identified and elaborated on by people doing the 
actual software development. They saw what worked and what didn’t. Further 
research and experiments at various companies fine tuned the process. Agile 
gained popularity and notoriety because it works—not because it’s the next 
great idea.
The first question to explore is: Is this company following the generally 
accepted definition of agile, or are they simply using bits and pieces of it? 
Next, we look at the roles. Do they have the right roles in place, such as scrum 
master, product owner, scrum team, and so forth? Do these roles have the 
right responsibilities and are the people empowered to get their work done? 
Next, I start to look at the rest of the organization. How do other groups 
operate? How are requirements developed and passed back and forth?
With all the assessment information in hand, you can then place the 
organization into a maturity model. This will also include a breakdown looking 
at subareas like leadership, methods and tools, planning and delivery, people 
and community, supporting processes and areas, and continuous improvement 
opportunities. The organization may have sprint activities partially in place, for 
example. Or the organization may not have a backlog.
One interesting point of note is that while the set of exhibited dysfunctions 
may be unique to an organization, the underlying principles to correct are 
universal.
Harpham: What kind of response do you receive when people receive these 
assessments?
Kollm: Let’s assume that the organization is interested in developing their 
agile capabilities. In many cases, changes are required at higher levels of the 
organization. It may also involve changes in interactions between departments.

Chapter 21 | David Kollm, Enterprise Agile Coach, Accenture
260
I recall working with a telecommunications company that had been doing 
some work in agile. They asked me to come in and do an assessment. While 
interviewing staff and reviewing documentation, I noticed that their burndown 
charts had a hockey-stick effect. That means that progress is made throughout 
the project, but nothing was accepted by the customer until the last few days 
of the sprint. I found out that the quality assurance group would not start 
testing until all the development work was complete.
Harpham: Why was the quality assurance group doing that? It sounds like 
they were holding back the process.
Kollm: It turns out that the QA group had an unwritten rule that no QA 
work could be done until all development work was done. It was a waterfall 
project management concept! Even though the organization had moved to 
agile and had merged the QA group with the development team, their systems 
and processes were still using the old way.
Harpham: That’s a great example of the challenges in adopting a new way of 
working like agile. They are often long-established procedures and unwritten 
rules that govern how work gets done. Unless those practices are deliberately 
identified and changed, the old way will stay in place.
Kollm: Right. I also find that agile adoption usually starts as a grassroots effort. 
There’s rarely an edict from “on high” commanding the adoption of agile. 
Usually, a few people here and there hear about agile. They get excited about 
the benefits and start to adopt it. Meanwhile, the rest of the organization is 
operating in the old way. There was no organizational-level effort to change 
systems, processes, and methods.
People thought of agile and scrum as operating at the level of an individual 
team. There was no effort to think through how it impacts the rest of the 
organization’s value chain.
Harpham: Let’s turn to teaching agile. I understand that you’ve taught agile 
within Accenture and elsewhere. What is your approach to teaching agile?
Kollm: As an agile coach, you often get involved in delivering training. In many 
cases, the teams simply have not had enough or any training when it comes to 
adopting agile. After an initial assessment, I create a curriculum of classes that 
addresses specific skills and understanding gaps. At a minimum, you need an 
experienced agile professional to guide the transformation process.
If you’re going to spend a million dollars or more to transform your 
organization, the cost of a coach is quite a small addition to that budget. 
Assigning a full-time coach to your organization for six months is often 
enough. Unfortunately, there’s often a lack of thought that goes into finding 
people with agile expertise. Agile training and development appears to be a 
field where some people think they can read a book or two and proclaim 
themselves to be experts.

261
Harpham: Speaking of books, what are some of the books that you’ve found 
highly valuable?
Kollm: There are several books that I would recommend. Let’s start with 
agile books.
Coaching Agile Teams by Lyssa Adkins [Addison-Wesley Professional, 2010].
Agile Estimating and Planning by Mike Cohn [Prentice Hall, 2005].
The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean Product 
Development by Donald G. Reinertsen [Celeritas Publishing, 2012].
Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time by Jeff Sutherland and 
JJ Sutherland [Crown Business, 2014].
User Stories Applied by Mike Cohn [Addison-Wesley Professional, 2004].
Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process by Kenneth S. 
Rubin [Addison-Wesley Professional, 2005].
Beyond agile and project books, here are a few other books I have found 
helpful, including:
The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles 
Duhigg [Random House, 2012].
Joy, Inc.: How We Built a Workplace People Love by Richard Sheridan [Portfolio, 
2013].
Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ by Daniel Goleman 
[Bantam, 2006].
Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream 
Customers by Geoffrey A. Moore [HarperBusiness, 2014].
Flight of the Buffalo: Soaring to Excellence, Learning to Let Employees Lead by James 
A. Belasco and Ralph C. Stayer [Warner Books, 1993].
The Flight of the Buffalo informs my thinking on leadership.
Harpham: Are there any other methodologies or frameworks that attract 
your interest?
Kollm: I have also been working on the Scaled Agile Framework recently. 
I find that many companies are interested in that concept because it is highly 
prescriptive. It gets them into agile, scrum, kanban, and related methods.
Harpham: The prescriptive nature of the Scaled Agile Framework is appealing?
Kollm: For large companies, that prescriptive aspect is appealing. They can 
make a complete change in a few years, versus other methodologies that are 
more difficult to adopt.

Chapter 21 | David Kollm, Enterprise Agile Coach, Accenture
262
Harpham: What is your daily productivity strategy to stay on top of your 
work and responsibilities?
Kollm: Some of my most productive days are days when I feel like I’ve done 
the least activity. In my role as a coach, there’s a tension for me to navigate. On 
the one hand, I’m secretly a “command and control guy.” On the other hand, 
I’m well reformed and see the value in using the coaching approach. The big 
challenge is to get people engaged with the agile process.
In the military, there’s the concept of “commander’s intent.” The commander 
makes sure that everybody understands that objective so that people can 
respond and move as events develop. However, it’s critical to avoid telling 
people exactly how to do it. People should adapt as events unfold. If everybody 
is clear on the objective, the organization heals and moves ahead. From a 
productivity standpoint, it continues to amaze me how people will come back 
with great work if you give them the objective and then set them free to get 
it done however they wish.
My productivity approach is informed by focusing in the right areas. In terms 
of work activity, I focus my attention on strategy and process. In terms of 
people, I focus my attention on managers and team leaders. Once they are 
equipped, they can direct their teams. At the end of the day, we then use 
metrics and measures to determine if we are performing well. I developed 
this high-leverage approach because it is often the only way to achieve the 
objective. Otherwise, I simply do not have enough bandwidth to work with 
everyone. This also allows people the ability to step up and take ownership of 
their work increasing their engagement.
Harpham: Your approach to significant change—like adopting agile—is 
interesting. You may look at the fifty-person department and say, “I don’t have 
time to manage all fifty people.” Therefore, my question becomes “Who are 
the four or five people that should be the focus of my efforts?” Is that type of 
thinking part of your approach?
Kollm: Yes, that’s fair. It all comes back to the span of control management 
concept. Any single person can only meaningfully lead five to eight people.
People often forget about training when it comes to agile adoption. A single 
burst of training at the beginning of the project is not enough. You need to 
continue the training activities during the project. In my experience, I find it 
effective to have at least two training sessions per week during an agile project. 
This continuous training is important—both to reinforce the concepts and to 
help new people on the project get up to speed.
The continuous training process gives everyone a common frame of reference. 
If somebody was unclear, almost anyone on the team could bring them up to 
speed. Training in this way goes a long way toward building team cohesion 
as well.

Harpham: Looking ahead over the next three to five years, what are some of 
the economic and technological opportunities that are most interesting to you?
Kollm: I don’t think anyone has fully exploited the development value chain 
from inception to delivery. This includes user experience design as well. I’m 
also interested in further adopting the continuous integration/continuous 
delivery [CI/CD] framework, a concept from DevOps. As agile has matured 
over the past five years, with many companies implementing agile project 
teams, they are seeing that their next bottleneck is in DevOps. The only way 
to get the power of agile delivery to market is to streamline and fix their sub 
and production release environments and processes.
This is where DevOps and CI/CD comes in—focusing on these areas so 
that work can “shift left” up the food chain of development and release. For 
example, some phone apps are updated continuously to improve results. 
Unfortunately, large organizations are struggling to adopt this fast, continuous 
improvement approach.

Hilary Wilson
Project Manager, EUMETSAT
Hilary Wilson joined EUMETSAT’s Sentinel-3 project in 2008, initially to man-
age the organization’s contribution to the development of the Payload Data Ground 
Segment (PDGS). In January 2015, she took up the role of project manager.
Wilson holds a degree in engineering geology and geotechnics from the University 
of Portsmouth (United Kingdom) and a master’s degree in remote sensing from 
University College/Imperial College London. She launched her space journey back in 
1989, working at the UK Processing and Archiving Facility (UK-PAF) in Farnborough, 
responsible for processing data from the European Space Agency’s ERS-1 and ERS-2 
satellites. This led to her holding the post of technical manager at the UK-PAF.
In 1996, Wilson moved to Darmstadt, Germany, to join EUMETSAT (European 
Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites), working 
first on the development of the Meteorological Products Extraction Facility for the 
Meteosat Second Generation program, and later as the EUMETSAT Polar System 
(EPS) data processing team leader. In 2016, Wilson continued her association with 
the Sentinel-3 project when she was appointed EUMETSAT’s Sentinel-3 mission 
manager.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in your career?
Hilary Wilson: Originally, I was interested in becoming a medical doctor. 
I got to age eighteen and my grades were not high enough for that path. 
In looking around for something else to do, I realized that my interest in 
geology might provide a good choice. Therefore, I embarked on a degree in 
22

Chapter 22 | Hilary Wilson, Project Manager, EUMETSAT

engineering geology, which included elements of satellite remote sensing. 
I particularly enjoyed these aspects because I could still do geology but from 
the warmth and dryness of an office instead of standing in the middle of a cold, 
wet, and often muddy field.
Building on this interest, I went on to earn a master’s degree in remote 
sensing, discovering just how much I enjoyed the subject. When I finished my 
master’s degree, there was a major space program underway in Europe—the 
European Space Agency satellite program [ERS-1], which I was fortunate to 
join. My first role in that project was as a scientist/programmer working on 
algorithm development, eventually rising to the position of technical manager 
at the UK-PAF.
In 1996, I left the UK to move to Darmstadt, Germany, where I initially 
went back into a more technical role relating to processing meteorological 
satellite data. As part of this role, I managed the procurement of facilities 
for EUMETSAT programs. In 2008, I moved to working on the European 
Commission’s Copernicus program.
Harpham: What was your initial role with Copernicus?
Wilson: I served as project manager for the Payload Data Ground Segment. 
This is the part of the ground infrastructure that processes the Sentinel-3 
satellite data and delivers data products to our users. In January 2015, I took 
over the project manager role for the whole of the EUMETSAT part of the 
Sentinel-3 mission.
Harpham: What is your current assignment?
Wilson: I still retain the project manager role, but in addition, I am also 
the “mission manager” for Sentinel-3. I’m responsible for two facets of 
Sentinel-3: operations for the Sentinel-3A satellite, which is already in orbit, 
and development activities on the Sentinel-3B satellite, planned for launch in 
early 2018. In the future, we will have further satellites launched as part of this 
program.
Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
Wilson: I brought several important qualities to bear. First, I was the most 
technically knowledgeable person on the work in question. Second, I also 
had strong organizational capabilities. My managers realized that. “Hilary, you 
know the most about this area of work technically and you’re able to organize 
people to get this work done. Therefore, would you like to act as a project 
manager?”
As a single parent with four children, I have to be good at managing life! Over 
the past twelve years, with a demanding full-time job and four small children, 
I’ve had to be highly organized. For example, managing the very different needs 

Project Managers at Work
267
of toddlers versus teenagers is similar to managing the conflicting and varying 
needs of a project. Thus, I joke that I brought these family organizational skills 
to my professional life.
If you can manage a family like mine, then project management is a breeze! 
At work, people will largely do what you say because you’re “the boss.” They 
don’t tend to argue back too much either, whereas you sometimes face that 
challenge at home. By inclination, I’m a people person and I like to bring people 
together in an organized fashion.
In my first project management job, I think there were doubts from my 
boss about whether I could actually do it. However, in 1993 I completed the 
altimeter product correction and upgrade project successfully, on time, and 
on budget. At that point, my managers were convinced that I was capable and 
gave me additional management responsibilities.
Harpham: You also had the willingness to take on the project management 
role, even though there was some uncertainty or risk associated with it.
Wilson: I was in my mid to late twenties when I took on this altimeter 
upgrade project, so I had the enthusiasm and “experience” of youth to help 
take on this project. I was convinced that I could do it! I believed I could do it, 
and I did it. I didn’t really see the risks at that point!
Harpham: You mentioned that you are a people person and that this 
capability helps you to succeed. What are some of the practices, habits, and 
behaviors that helps you perform as a “people person”?
Wilson: There’s an advantage to being a woman. I believe that identity gives 
me a stronger approach to collaboration than others appear to have. I’m 
working in a male-dominated environment and I have been for my entire 
professional career. I’m usually the only woman in the room [though that 
situation is gradually improving]. My approach is to build collaborative 
relationships, because you are always going to achieve more together than on 
your own.
My colleagues appreciate that I’m going to build them up. I’m not one of those 
people who tears down other people in an effort to make myself look better.
If I have good team members, they make me look good. In the past, I have 
worked with managers who were difficult or who had a bad reputation. Their 
lack of “competence” really frustrated me. However, I have come to realize 
that reputation goes both ways. If I have competent people working for me, 
that performance reflects well on me. If my team has a competent boss, they 
also look good. Thus, it’s in my best interest to ensure that my boss succeeds, 
because that will enhance both their reputation and mine. That’s a lesson 
I recommend to young people for career development. They’re often too 
focused on their individual accomplishments. In fact, you can look better by 
helping others achieve success.

Chapter 22 | Hilary Wilson, Project Manager, EUMETSAT
268
I do not know everything on this complicated project that I’m working on. 
I’m well known for saying, “I’m not an expert on that but I have brought the 
expert on that topic to the meeting.” I don’t see many of my male colleagues 
acting in that way. They don’t seem to want to say, “I don’t know about X,” 
because they believe it makes them lose face. In contrast, I believe it enhances 
my reputation to be honest. People know that I am credible if I express an 
opinion.
In my view, an effective manager empowers the people below to do their job. 
That includes supporting them when they make a mistake and helping them 
to make it right.
Harpham: Anything else to add on your approach to connect with people?
Wilson: People know that my work matters to me. It’s not just a job to me. 
That reality is both a positive and a negative. I work very long hours because 
I want the project to work. People know that I work hard on the project 
because I want it to succeed. If you’re enthusiastic about what you do, it is 
easier to bring other people with you. In fact, some people may not like the 
specific project or work very much, but they work hard anyway because they 
don’t want to disappoint you.
It’s also important to take the time to understand the different motivations 
of people on the team. Some people are motivated for example by a need for 
glory. You have to find ways for them to satisfy that need. Other people are 
more interested in financial rewards. Still others have a focus on the project 
simply working out successfully.
Harpham: Let’s turn to Copernicus and Sentinel-3. Can you define the 
objective of the program?
Wilson: Copernicus is a European system for monitoring the Earth, funded 
by the European Union. It consists of a set of different systems that collect 
data, including satellites and in-situ observations—for example, shipborne 
sensors, balloons, buoys, etc. The goal is to produce data products to support 
different thematic areas: land, marine, atmosphere, climate change, emergency 
management, and security.
Turning to my project work, my role is to ensure the production of reliable 
and timely data products for our users—for example, national meteorological 
services, marine monitoring services, and climate services. For some 
applications, timely release of the data is the priority. In other cases, data 
accuracy is the priority. For emergency management, you need information as 
fast as possible. For example, understanding how a forest fire is spreading – 
week old data is unsuitable in that context. In other areas like climate change, 
very high accuracy data is prized. Therefore, taking more time to produce a 
high-quality data product is acceptable.

Project Managers at Work
269
In Copernicus, we provide data through a series of satellite missions called the 
Sentinels. These are dedicated to different types of remote sensing. Sentinel-3A 
and B are primarily dedicated to monitoring the oceans. We are measuring 
sea surface temperature, ocean color, sea level height, wind, and waves, and 
so forth. The Sentinel-3 mission is a combined development between the 
European Space Agency [ESA] and EUMETSAT on behalf of the European 
Commission. ESA is responsible for providing data to the land users and 
EUMETSAT covers the marine users. The project requires both establishing 
the ground infrastructure and the satellites themselves. ESA provides the 
satellites and both organizations work together on the ground infrastructure.
Harpham: What is your current focus within this program?
Wilson: There are two areas we’re working on. We have one satellite that is 
already in orbit that is ramping up to its full, routine operation launched just 
over a year ago [Sentinel-3A in February 2016]. The second satellite [3B] is 
due to be launched at the beginning of 2018. We are preparing the systems 
and getting ready to operate both satellites in parallel.
We are going to use a tandem operation model for the first few months that 
we have both satellites in orbit. This means that we will fly the Sentinel-3A 
and the Sentinel-3B very close together, with only a thirty-second separation. 
Nominally, we will then fly them with a separation of 140 degrees, which 
amounts to a minimum separation of thirty-eight minutes.
Harpham: You had mentioned that you had recently taken on the role of 
mission manager. What does that involve?
Wilson: The mission manager role is a new one to the EUMETSAT organization. 
In brief, the goal is to make sure we are providing the best quality of service 
to our users. That involves many different facets: communicating with our 
users, proactively explaining quality issues, and making sure that the satellite 
operations are going smoothly. It’s a big team—of around 120 people—that 
delivers on all of these responsibilities. I also review recommendations and 
suggestions from our users on how we can improve our products and quality. 
In operations, we do not like surprises. We like changes planned well in 
advance so everyone can be properly informed.
Harpham: One of the challenges you face is delivering data products on time. 
What are some of the schedule pressures that you find particularly difficult?
Wilson: Schedules are an interesting problem for space projects. On the one 
hand, space projects have a long duration. You can easily spend ten years in the 
development phase on a project and twenty years operating a satellite. In the 
beginning, not much happens. Then suddenly you may have a situation where 
you have to react quickly if something goes wrong—or face a large impact on 
your costs or schedule.

Chapter 22 | Hilary Wilson, Project Manager, EUMETSAT

There’s a misconception in some areas that the space industry is always on 
the cutting edge of technology. That isn’t true, because it takes years to get 
a project ready for space. Technology launched into space is often ten years 
behind the cutting edge for that reason. On Sentinel-3, when we came close to 
the official launch date, we were constantly changing the project schedule. For 
example, delays in testing the ground processing software, delays due to the 
proper launch permissions not being signed, and bad weather at the airport 
in Russia delaying the transport of the satellite from France to the launch site.
Harpham: Do you face challenges with stakeholders?
Wilson: For the first time, we are working jointly with our colleagues in 
the European Space Agency on the development of the ground segment. 
Originally, EUMETSAT was part of the ESA, so there is a shared history. 
However, Sentinel-3 was the first time the organizations collaborated 
together on the ground segment aspect of the project, having always worked 
together on the space segment. You have two organizations with different 
philosophies and different methodologies. Despite these differences, we had 
to marry these different approaches and develop a joint way forward. That 
was quite the challenge!
At first, there was a perception from both sides of “Why wouldn’t the other 
side do it our way?” You have to realize that just because you think your 
way is best, that doesn’t make the other way wrong. You have to learn to 
compromise where you can and to hold firm when it is important. Getting 
one’s head around the idea that they are different—rather than better or 
worse—took some work.
Harpham: Given that you work with an international organization, do you 
face cultural challenges?
Wilson: It is both challenging and enriching. You have to be aware of the 
cultural sensitivities with certain behaviors. For example, I once corrected 
a manager in a meeting because he said something factually incorrect. That 
action would have been perfectly acceptable in the UK, where I’m from. 
Afterwards, the person was furious with me. He said, “If you had done that 
in France, one of us would have had to leave the organization!” I found that 
surprising. It demonstrated that there are very different attitudes on whether 
it is culturally acceptable to correct a manager or authority figure in public.
It was a lesson with broader implications for me. Just because I know how 
to operate in the UK doesn’t mean that I can use the exact same practices 
elsewhere. Likewise, one often hears jokes about British humor. Sometimes that 
sense of wit or sarcasm doesn’t translate well. When you work internationally, 
you realize that many of the practices you consider to be natural or normal 
are simply cultural practices from where you are from.

After living in Germany for a number of years, I’ve adjusted to some of the 
practices here. For instance, it is common to kiss a close friend or business 
associate on the cheek when you meet them. That’s absolutely standard. Yet, 
when I travel to the UK and use that same practice, British colleagues are 
surprised. There are many differences like this, large and small.
Harpham: Let’s turn to your leadership philosophy. How has your approach 
to management and leadership changed over time?
Wilson: Emphasizing collaboration is the major change in my management 
approach. When you’re starting off in management, you feel that you have to 
prove yourself and outperform everyone else. I’m sure in some industries that 
approach is still considered the way to go. There’s an old joke that the word 
“team” actually means “together everybody achieves more.” I regularly say 
that to my team to emphasize the importance of working together closely. 
Building on that concept, it’s best to surround yourself with people who are 
interested in collaboration and providing support to each other.
Over the years, I have learned the importance of being myself as a leader. 
I’ve always worked in male-dominated environments all the way back to my 
university studies. Therefore, there was always a subtle pressure to fit in with 
the men. In contrast, my approach is naturally informed by the fact that I’m 
a woman and a mother. For example, I have quite strong maternal instincts, 
which means that I am protective of the people who work for me. I now see 
this as a positive quality because I’m trusted and people are happy to work for 
me. They know that I will support them, but also I will hold them accountable 
when they have not done well.
Not long after I started my current position, one person on my team 
commented that I had continued “to be me,” rather than trying to copy the 
style of the previous manager.
I used to wear a “suit of armor” at work so that I wasn’t hurt by others. 
However, people started to treat me differently when I had that approach. 
They thought that everything was bouncing off my armor. It took me a long 
time to realize that if other people were unaware they were hurting me, how 
could they change their behavior and interactions with me? I had to take the 
armor off and make people see me as a vulnerable human being who can 
sometimes be upset when things go wrong.
That was a hard lesson because it meant a lot of personal change for me. 
When you’re managing relationships with others, you have to realize that 
others may not want or be able to change. That means the onus is on you 
to change first. Taking on the persona of somebody else is ineffective and 
stressful. Now I understand that just being myself is much easier and the 
armor has been officially retired.

Chapter 22 | Hilary Wilson, Project Manager, EUMETSAT
272
Harpham: The armor metaphor makes me think of feedback. If somebody 
does something that you don’t like, but there’s no reaction—positive or 
negative, the person has no feedback from you on what to do next.
Harpham: What does personal productivity system look like?
Wilson: I don’t have a set-in-stone routine that I use every day. I do rely 
on written lists to stay organized with all of my work. I regularly review my 
lists and ask myself, “What’s important and what’s urgent here?” I also make 
appointments with myself on my calendar in order to plan and organize my 
work. If I don’t do that, I will be fully booked in meetings with other people all 
day. I agree with the saying “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.”
From a project-planning perspective, I’m fortunate to be supported by a great 
team. We have weekly meetings to review the projects. That covers both 
short-term tasks on the project [i.e., to be done in the next week] and long-
term matters. That advance planning is important because we want to make 
sure that we plan user communications well in advance of implementing a 
change. There is also a need to keep some free time available on my schedule, 
because there are sometimes emergencies to be handled with satellite 
operations and related issues.
My two main productivity tools boil down to my calendar and keeping lists. If 
I had overly rigid systems, it would not cope with emergency situations that 
periodically occur in my world. After all, satellites operate on a 24/7 basis. 
As you move further up into management roles, you have to expect greater 
demands on your time, including some expectations you may have to work 
periodically on evenings or weekends. After all, if it is a Saturday and the 
satellite is in danger of collision, that problem needs to be addressed right 
away.
Harpham: Which books have you found the most professionally valuable?
Wilson: Two books come to mind. Feminist Fight Club by Jessica Bennett 
[Harper Wave, 2016] is excellent. This book deals with how women undermine 
themselves professionally. For example, let’s say you perform well and earn a 
bonus at work. In that scenario, there’s an unfortunate practice where women 
are likely to tell people that you were lucky rather than saying you earned 
it. For me, it’s important to be a good role model as a senior manager and 
show how to succeed and still be yourself. The book has a tongue-in-cheek 
approach to careers and how to manage your career effectively.
The other book that comes to mind is An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth 
by Chris Hadfield [Little, Brown and Company, 2013], a Canadian astronaut. 
There are a lot of good lessons there for management and leadership. The 
book had a great lesson about having not the goal of being the best at 
everything but rather seeking to be a “zero,” meaning you perfectly fulfill all 
your responsibilities within the team or a “plus-one,” where you do a bit 

Project Managers at Work
273
more, rather than a “minus-one,” where others have to support you. It’s a 
metaphor for looking for ways to see your contribution in terms of its impact 
on the team goals, rather than competing with others to outshine them.
Harpham: For the reader who is interested in moving into project 
management, what advice would you give them to make that move?
Wilson: Start small. Manage a piece of work in a field that you know well 
technically. If you already understand the technical details of an area, you are 
then freed up to develop your project management skills on that piece of 
work. After you successfully complete a project in your area of expertise, you 
can then look for opportunities to manage projects in other areas. This was 
the strategy that I used to develop my career.
I learned a great rule of thumb from my father about leading work and teams 
in new areas where you are not the expert. Make your first goal to learn 
enough so that you can ask three intelligent questions about the work, and 
then build from there. That level of knowledge gives you a base to build on.
Finally, you have to like working with people to succeed in project management. 
You can’t get the job done without directing and engaging the team. Some 
people miss the fundamental reality that your project team does the work for 
you as the project manager.
Chapter Summary
• 
Recommended books include Feminist Flight Club by 
Jessica Bennett and An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth 
by Chris Hadfield.
• 
Breaking into project management: Start on small projects 
where you understand all of the technical details. As you 
build success on those projects, you will be well placed to 
pursue additional opportunities.
• 
Master self-awareness as a leader. Wilson became more 
successful as a manager when she used her own approach 
rather than copying the approach of other managers.
• 
Two-way reputation dynamics: If you perform well, it 
makes your superiors look good. If your project team 
members perform well, that will reflect well on you. It is 
in your best interest to make your boss succeed.
• 
Understand different motivations. If you are managing a 
team of people, you will be more effective if you take the 
time to understand each individual’s motivations.

Sarina Arcari
Vice President of Enterprise Program 
Management, Amtrak
Sarina Arcari, PMP, is Vice President of the Enterprise Program Management 
Office at Amtrak. Prior to Amtrak, she led a 27-person team of project and program 
management professionals at Amerigroup (now part of Anthem Inc.) to provide 
access to health care for Medicaid and Medicare populations. In 2014, her team 
at WellPoint was awarded the PMO of the Year award by the Project Management 
Institute (PMI). Arcari holds a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing from the 
University of Connecticut. Arcari is also a graduate of PMI’s Leadership Institute 
Master Class.
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in project management?
Sarina Arcari: When I teach project management, I always tell people 
you can learn project management skills and knowledge from classes and 
resources. However, I believe there’s a subset of the population that can’t help 
but work on projects. It’s the way they’re wired. We think in work breakdown 
structures. We make lists and check them twice! I think I’m one of those 
people.
Thinking back to my parents and childhood, I had some early experiences that 
made a difference. My dad is a mechanical engineer by training and worked 
in the US Army Corps of Engineers. He was managing projects his entire 
career. At home, he was constantly working on do-it-yourself activities and 
I became his assistant. My mom gets equal credit. As a military wife, she was

extraordinarily organized. In fact, I recall my first “project plan.” Before I 
learned how to read, my mother prepared a chores chart with pictures that 
explained what I had to do each week. I was wired for this kind of organized 
project thinking from early on.
I was always that person who had a project of some kind going on during 
college and afterwards. I always enjoyed solving problems and taking on 
responsibilities beyond my day job. As I acquired a reputation for being the 
go-to person to get work done, my career progression took off.
Within the healthcare field, I worked at a variety of health insurance companies. 
Joining Great-West Healthcare was a key turning point for my career. At Great-
West, I was brought in to help them with a “buy or build decision” related to 
a national behavioral health product. Management didn’t want anyone from 
inside the organization—such as those with turf to protect—to get involved 
in this work. As a result of the assessment, we decided to buy a system and 
I led the implementation project. By successfully implementing that project, I 
was then asked to stay on and work on other projects.
Harpham: How did you come to work at Amtrak?
Arcari: For the first twenty-five years of my career, I was in the healthcare 
industry. In 2015, I won a PMI award and listed that on my LinkedIn profile. 
Amtrak ultimately discovered me through LinkedIn and that’s how the hiring 
discussion began. I told them, “I don’t know anything about trains.” Their 
response: “We’ve got over 20,000 people who know how to run trains, but 
we don’t have anybody who knows how to run a good project.” And the rest 
is history.
Harpham: Did formal project management training play a role in your career 
growth?
Arcari: I recall having a conversation with my boss at Great-West Healthcare 
on that topic. He encouraged me to get certified in project management. 
These were the early days of PMP certification. There were something like 
100,000 certified people at that point. I was resistant to going for the PMP. My 
response was: “Either I’m good at this or I’m not. Putting three letters after 
my name will not impact how well I do my job.” Eventually, I went on to earn 
the certification.
Harpham: What happened after you earned the PMP?
Arcari: Shortly after I earned the PMP, I moved to a new organization. My 
assignment was to create a project management office [PMO], though they 
called it by a different name. This company worked on government contracts 
related to Medicare and Medicaid. The company was winning contracts faster 
than it could implement them. The project management group was charged 
with implementing these contracts into production.

Project Managers at Work
277
I mentioned to Amerigroup that it sounds like they wanted a PMO. Surprisingly,  
they forbade using the term “PMO” because they had had a very bad 
experience attempting to set up a PMO in the past. Several years before I 
got there, they had invested millions of dollars in an enterprise PPM system. 
They had no process to support the system, so it didn’t generate much of an 
improvement in terms of getting projects done.
As I set up the “implementation management office,” I realized that I would 
need a team of people to do the work. Further, I realized that I needed a 
common language and frame of reference to do the work.
Harpham: It’s interesting to see that the “PMO” term was associated with 
this terrible failure at the organization. Yet the organization you led there 
would be called a “PMO” anywhere else. Is this a question of terminology?
Arcari: I find that many organizations set up PMOs because they’re suffering. 
Projects are not getting completed. Therefore, the organization is looking to 
bring some organization to the chaos.
The “IMO” in that organization ended up winning the 2014 PMO of the Year 
award from PMI. I pushed internally to nominate our organization for the 
award, even though the leadership didn’t like the “PMO” term. Ultimately, I 
sold the idea of applying for the award by pointing out that, if we won, we 
could use that award in our sales and marketing material, including proposals 
to the government. Management then saw the value in pursuing the award.
The company’s prior effort to create a PMO encountered problems for 
several reasons. There was no process or methodology developed. There was 
no dedicated project management staff. Likewise, there were no supporting 
policies or procedures in place. Essentially, the organization was sold a bill of 
goods by a slick vendor who promised that using their PPM software would 
solve their problems. For a PPM implementation process to produce results, 
you need to start with the premise that you’re automating a process that 
already works. If not, then you’re going to produce mistakes and failures faster.
The company began to grow—up to forty-eight percent annual growth! We 
were able to handle that increased work without significantly increasing our 
staff. That was possible because we had a repeatable methodology to implement 
contracts as they were won. My work with this company and winning the 
PMO of the Year award is one of my greatest career accomplishments so far. 
We grew the company from $3 billion in sales to $12 billion in sales in a few 
years. We were acquired by the second largest healthcare insurance company 
in the country—Anthem—in 2012.
Harpham: That’s a huge increase in volume. How did you manage that 
increase while maintaining project delivery quality?
Arcari: There are several reasons. First, we specialized in a certain category of 
business: Medicaid. We also put major effort into developing a solid, repeatable 
project management process that could be used over and over again.

Chapter 23 | Sarina Arcari, Vice President of Enterprise Program Management, Amtrak
278
Harpham: Let’s go into the before-and-after changes involved in setting up 
the PMO and its impact on the organization. If I were an executive at the 
organization, what was my experience like with projects before you came in?
Arcari: The company’s founder had just stepped down from the CEO role 
and moved to become chairman of the board. The former chief operating 
officer became the CEO. It was the perfect time for a transition. It takes 
one set of skills to found a company. It takes another set of skills to keep 
growing the company to new heights and bring it to the scale of a Fortune 
500 company.
Shortly before I arrived, the company suffered a major blow from a lawsuit. 
While the lawsuit was settled, it was an expensive settlement. It was also a 
wakeup call to revisit how they approached the business. It turns out that the 
company missed a critical step in their work and this led them to experience 
significant problems. They lost a contract for an entire state. Much or all of 
that problem can be traced back to a project management or implementation 
flaw. That pain motivated the new CEO to look for ways to improve the 
organization’s implementation capabilities.
Harpham: Were there project managers on staff when you arrived?
Arcari: When I arrived, there were no credentialed project managers on 
staff. There were no people who had the project manager title either. Since 
the company had a start-up culture, there were people doing projects “off 
the side of their desk.” For example, you might have someone in the claims 
department who would work on implementation when the company won a 
new contract.
Harpham: What were your priorities when it came to starting the PMO?
Arcari: I tend to act as a people-first manager. First, I spent ninety days 
investigating the “as is” situation at the company. I wanted to know how the 
organization was currently doing projects. Was anything working? I have the 
view that there’s almost always something good at an organization that you 
can recognize and build on. I found a few places where people put forward 
heroic efforts to get the work done, for example. One department had a full-
time person dedicated to implementation work, and they were performing 
better than other departments.
I proposed that further improvements required dedicated project 
management staff with deep expertise. I was able to secure twelve positions 
for project implementations. I handed out those roles to various functional 
areas to support implementation. My negotiation point with the functional 
managers was: “I need your best thinker and execution person to serve on the 
implementation work. You can use this new position to backfill the position 
with a new hire.” I made it clear that I could not take somebody inexperienced 
to work on implementations.

Project Managers at Work
279
Harpham: How did those negotiations with the functional managers unfold, 
since you were asking for their best people?
Arcari: If I learned nothing else in my career, it’s this: no PMO can be 
successful without executive support. Ideally, that support should go all the 
way to the top, including the board of directors. I had that support, which 
helped tremendously. Some managers were simply happy to get an “extra 
body” in their department and they were willing to do whatever it took to 
make that happen. Overall, the managers understood this arrangement would 
ultimately serve them and the company. I made it clear their person would 
continue to report to the functional manager. However, that top performer 
had to be fully dedicated to my implementations.
Harpham: Once you had these people, how did you direct them to work 
on projects?
Arcari: I sent them out to lead projects in various parts of the company. 
Over time, the project implementation team grew. Early on, there were major 
struggles. We actually started off with one Microsoft Project license for the 
whole company. That meant one person had to manage all the schedules and 
related information. People would print the reports, fax them out, and receive 
updates back by fax. This whole process—fax-based updates—was used in 
2008 and 2009.
Harpham: Why were they using these manual processes?
Arcari: The company was in the start-up phase at that time so resources 
were limited. In the Medicaid business, you plan for a one- to three-percent 
profit margin. That means that there are limited resources available to invest 
in software licenses. Fortunately, as we proved our process, we gradually 
obtained more resources and could become even more productive.
Harpham: How did you further develop the organization’s project 
management maturity?
Arcari: We started to offer two-day internal classes on project management 
for everybody who worked on our projects. More and more of our staff earned 
the PMP certification as well. I also wrote the policy and procedure manual 
to guide our work, which defined the five phases of project management with 
our company’s spin on it. It was a step-by-step process: first, do this, then use 
this template, and so on. It was a highly prescriptive approach. I even specified 
items, such as the meeting agenda format for project meetings.
We were very prescriptive because there was so far to grow in our project 
management maturity. By adopting this disciplined approach, we were able to 
keep up with the growth in 2013 and beyond. Eventually, it became a well-oiled 
machine.

Chapter 23 | Sarina Arcari, Vice President of Enterprise Program Management, Amtrak
280
Harpham: It’s striking to note the value of executing on the fundamentals of 
project management consistently. It gives you the capability to propose further 
improvements and obtain resources, like training and software licenses.
Arcari: Right. It’s interesting because nobody wants to focus on the 
fundamentals. They want to focus on the “sexy” items like a five-million-dollar 
project management software system. In my present role, I’m going through 
a similar experience of building up the organization’s project management 
capability.
Harpham: How has your thinking on project management certification 
evolved? How does it relate to your “people first” leadership philosophy?
Arcari: My thinking on project management certification changed after I 
finished the first ninety days at the company. During that time, I investigated 
the organization’s current situation and capabilities. I realized that people 
were using the same words and terms with different meanings. There was no 
common ground when it came to project management.
One person might say, “I need a project manager.” It turns out that they actually 
wanted one thing that was quite different. I recall one person saying something 
like, “You’re not a project manager. A project manager would sit with me in 
my department and do the work right here.” Their understanding of project 
management was based on hiring an outside consulting firm and having that 
outside person sit with them to do the work.
I quickly came to the realization that a common lexicon and methodology was 
needed before I could do anything here. I decided to go with the certification 
and standards offered by the Project Management Institute. I’m grateful to PMI 
beyond measure for the great resources that they have. At the same time, I 
consider the PMBOK Guide rather difficult to read yet there is great material 
in there. I focused on the five phases of project management starting with 
initiation and planning. That was enough for us to get started. I also found 
great project management job descriptions from PMI, which helped me to 
build the organization.
Harpham: How did you approach defining project management roles at the 
organization?
Arcari: I went to the organization’s human resources department and asked 
to see all of the project management job descriptions. There were eighteen 
job descriptions on the books! They all said the same thing with minor 
differences, like “finance project manager” or “IT project manager.”
In order to attract great project managers, they want to know what’s next for 
them in terms of career path. When I walked in the door, I didn’t have a good 
answer to that point. I fixed that situation by adapting PMI’s project manager 
job descriptions to the organization. I also used the PMI salary survey to work 
with human resources to come up with the right compensation level for 

Project Managers at Work
281
each role. Fortunately, human resources was cooperative and liked the fact 
that I came to the table with all of PMI’s resources.
Harpham: Have you ever seen that situation with multiple job descriptions 
and an unclear career progression for project managers anywhere else?
Arcari: When I arrived at Amtrak, there were hundreds of project 
management job descriptions. I’m working with HR right now to revise and 
simplify the job descriptions for project management.
My “people first” focus led me to ask how I could boost the credibility of 
project managers in this organization. Part of the answer was seeking 
professional training, like the PMP. Part of the answer was to create a project 
management career progression.
I want to show the outside world that we’re an employer of choice for 
project management professionals. We recognize it as a profession at Amtrak 
and we want top-notch talent. That employer of choice concept extends to 
supporting volunteering with PMI and providing training. We also sponsor the 
local PMI chapter.
Harpham: What are some of the mistakes that you see novice project 
managers make?
Arcari: When you lack professional working experience, you try to find a 
guidebook that will tell you what you’re supposed to do. I see younger project 
managers open the PMBOK Guide and expect to find a “how to” process to 
answer the question “what should I do tomorrow?” The PMBOK Guide is not 
designed to provide that kind of answer. It’s a guide to a body of knowledge 
assembled by many project managers.
There’s also a related mistake: attempting to apply the entire PMBOK to each 
and every project. They haven’t learned the art of assessing how much process 
to use on a particular project to achieve success. Based on my experience in 
the healthcare field, I came up with a metaphor to describe this approach: 
we need to practice “minimally invasive” project management just enough 
process to get the project completed—no more and no less.
The missing piece at Amtrak’s project management right now is a lack of 
resources to help new project managers. We have standards, policies, and 
a career path, but there is not yet a detailed manual that lays out all of the 
processes and procedures. For example, what should a project manager do on 
day one of a new project? That is not yet in place here.
Harpham: How do you decide how much process to use?
Arcari: I developed what I called a “T-shirt sizing” model—a way to classify 
your project as small, medium, large or mega. For each of those levels, there’s 
an accompanying amount of process recommended to successfully complete 
the project. When people are early in the career, they don’t have enough 

Chapter 23 | Sarina Arcari, Vice President of Enterprise Program Management, Amtrak
282
experience to do “T-shirt sizing” approach. As a result, they feel the need to 
do everything on the project.
The other point to keep in mind for this “T-shirt sizing” model is the level of 
talent required to manage the project. You need one kind of person to lead 
a mega project and a different kind of person to work on a smaller project.
Harpham: If you have a six-week project, it doesn’t make sense to use a 
three- or four-week planning process.
Arcari: That’s right. A twelve-page communication plan would not make 
sense for that kind of project.
Harpham: You mentioned “mega projects” as one of the categories. Do you 
have any mega projects in your portfolio?
Arcari: When I arrived at Amtrak, I had to adjust my definition of small, 
medium, large and mega projects compared to my previous organization. In my 
previous organization, a long and involved project might have lasted eighteen 
to twenty-four months. In contrast, there are Amtrak projects that will take 
years and years to complete. Some may take up to thirty years to complete.
It’s been a growth opportunity for me to think about how do I approach mega 
projects where the completion date is years into the future. How do I get 
excited about those?
Harpham: Do you have any of those thirty-year projects underway right 
now?
Arcari: There’s the Gateway Program. The objective is to increase train 
capacity in the northeastern United States—starting from New Jersey and 
continuing further north. Right now, train capacity in this region is limited 
by two one-hundred-year-old tunnels that go underneath the Hudson River 
[which separates New Jersey and New York]. Those two tunnels currently 
handle twenty-four trains per hour in each direction—one going north and 
the other going south. These tunnels are safe, but they require immense 
maintenance efforts to keep in good condition because of their age.
Unfortunately, these train tunnels cannot be taken out of service for upgrades. 
Taking these tunnels out of service would economically devastate the 
Northeast. Therefore, we have to build at least one new tunnel before we can 
take one of the older ones out of service. Eventually, we are going to have four 
tunnels in the region, which means we will have doubled the capacity.
However, we will then reach another roadblock. Once you cross into 
Manhattan, there’s a constraint at Penn Station. There’s a limited number of 
train tracks that go into the station. So you can’t simply push more trains 
into that station. As a result, we have to purchase an entire city block in 
Manhattan in order to expand Penn Station. That will allow us to add eight 
more underground train tracks into the city. All of the approaches, train yards 

Project Managers at Work
283
and more will need to be expanded for greater capacity. Finally, keep in mind 
that this project is not limited to passenger rail. Freight rail is also in scope. 
This is a huge project. I will probably be retired well before it is completed.
Harpham: How does this project compare to other large projects you know 
about?
Arcari: This is probably one of the largest projects of this kind currently 
underway in the United States. Compared to Dubai or China, there’s not as 
many mega infrastructure projects underway in the US right now. The US 
needs to do more of these projects actually. At the very least, we need more 
repair projects to keep our infrastructure in good condition.
I’d say this Gateway project is one of the biggest and sexiest projects currently 
underway in the United States.
Harpham: How do you get people excited about a project where they may 
not see it through to completion?
Arcari: I’ve learned that engineers and people at Amtrak love these long-
term mega projects. For me, simply being around these people has helped 
me realize it is a great project to work on even if you’re not here when it is 
finished. It’s inspiring to be affiliated with a project that will probably still be 
here one hundred years from now. The existing tunnels are just over one 
hundred years old. Given the much better technology we have today, the new 
tunnels might last two hundred years!
I’ve never worked on projects that will have that kind of legacy. I had not 
previously worked in construction projects so this is a new world for me. 
These Amtrak projects serve the public good and function as economic 
enablers.
The young engineers I talk to are excited about this project because it is a 
special opportunity. Right now, if you’re an engineer and want to work on 
a mega project, many of the opportunities are in Dubai, China, and other 
countries. To be able to stay at home in the US and still work on a mega 
project—there’s not many opportunities like that.
There are also a number of people who are train fanatics. They just love 
everything about trains—building them, running them and beyond. Some 
people can quote baseball statistics from memory. I know people who can do 
the same for trains. That enthusiasm makes them easy to work with because 
they’re so motivated.
Harpham: I’m curious to understand more about Amtrak and how it came 
to play its role as the main US passenger rail service. Can you briefly explain 
how Amtrak came about?

Chapter 23 | Sarina Arcari, Vice President of Enterprise Program Management, Amtrak
284
Arcari: Amtrak came into existence in 1971. Prior to that time, there were 
many different railways serving different parts of the country. Today, there are 
still a number of very large railway companies in the United States, like Union 
Pacific and BNSF. All of these independent railroads carry some combination 
of passengers and freight.
Everything changed in the 1970s when the railway companies decided to exit 
the passenger rail business. The US government realized this was a problem. 
It’s a big country and there’s value in having passenger rail service. Amtrak was 
created by Congress with participation from the existing railway companies. 
Today, Amtrak is the only national-scale passenger rail operation serving the 
US. We only own the rails in part of the Northeastern region—between 
Boston and Washington, DC.
Structurally, Amtrak is a private corporation that cooperates with the 
government. For example, some of our large projects to build or improve 
facilities and infrastructure are funded through grants. However, most of our 
operations, revenues, and expenses are handled independently.
Harpham: Over your career, you’ve moved through several roles. You’ve had 
the role of the individual project manager who is delivering the project. Today, 
you’re in the role of managing and developing project managers. How did you 
navigate the transition to a management role?
Arcari: When I coach and mentor people going through this transition, I 
tell people that it’s the most difficult professional transition you will ever 
make. Going from an individual contributor role to being a leader of people 
is challenging. As an individual project manager, you may think that you have 
direct control over the project. It’s an illusion. You do not have control.
Learning how to be comfortable with discomfort is the number one point to 
transition to a leadership role. You will reach the limit of your personal work 
capacity at a certain point. If you’re asked to do more work than your personal 
capacity, you need to be able to work through people. Therefore, you need 
to get ready for those requests by training your people to be just as good or 
better than you were as an individual contributor. Then you have to set them 
free to get working.
When you have ten different project managers each going in their own 
direction, you’re never going to know what exactly they’re doing. That’s 
different from being deeply involved in the details of a single project as a 
project manager. When you’re running a project management office, you tend 
to pay attention to projects that are in trouble—those with red status. Your 
job becomes teaching people to become as smart as capable as possible so 
that your project portfolio stays in good shape.

For me, I took a full year to make the transition into a management role. The 
transition was harder than I thought it would be. It’s harder than it looks! 
When you watch your boss from a distance, you might think, “How hard 
can that job be?” I think it’s more difficult mentally and emotionally than an 
individual role. From time to time, I wish I could go back to being a project 
manager, because it would be easier to manage compared to what I do now.
Harpham: What are some of the aspects of your role that you find especially 
challenging?
Arcari: At Amtrak, we have over a dozen labor unions and many different 
contracts. This week, I spent half a day meeting with the general chairmen 
from the unions to discuss their concerns. I also happened to be the only 
woman in the room for that meeting. It was a tough meeting. There was a lot 
of bravado to get through.
Harpham: Speaking of tough meetings, let’s turn to the topic of conflict. 
How do you approach and solve conflicts productively?
Arcari: My approach has changed over time. Earlier in my career, I usually 
avoided conflict. However, I’ve come to understand that conflict is part of 
human nature. In many instances, it’s healthy and should be encouraged. That’s 
doesn’t mean starting fights though.
The better approach is to foster an environment where people feel comfortable 
bringing up problems and questions. I believe that there’s always a path to yes. 
We might not all be happy with the solution but we should be able to get 
everybody some of what they’re looking for.
I’ve also noticed that there are some people who are “negative scanners.” On 
one level, they drive me nuts because their perspective is so different from 
my view of “there’s always a way to make this work.” That said, I’ve come to 
appreciate and cultivate the “negative scanners” in the organization when I 
find them. They’re the people who find problems that nobody else is talking 
about. I find that the quiet ones often have a lot to say but you have to draw 
it out of them.
From time to time, I act as the devil’s advocate in some discussions. That 
approach is especially important in risk management where it is valuable to 
think about what can go wrong on the project. It all goes back to that idea of 
“you have to comfortable with uncomfortable situations.”
Harpham: It’s interesting to see the preferences and interests of people 
drawn to project work. Some people are drawn to the field because they love 
to achieve and ship big projects. Others like the order and process-oriented 
nature of the work. What do you think draws people into project work?

Chapter 23 | Sarina Arcari, Vice President of Enterprise Program Management, Amtrak
286
Arcari: Problem solvers are drawn to the field. Project managers tend to 
be very achievement oriented. They want to get this project done. Then 
they want to know what’s next for them both in terms of their career and 
upcoming projects.
Harpham: What does your personal productivity system look like?
Arcari: Everything starts with my calendar. I use Microsoft Outlook. I live and 
die by the calendar! As a general practice, I aim to keep at least two hours 
per day free from meetings during business hours. It was important for me to 
articulate that rule as I have worked with assistants since 2010.
In terms of the details, I don’t manage my calendar. My assistant runs that from 
me based on principles that I set up. My assistant and I meet every morning to 
review the calendar and address any conflicts.
In terms of scheduling, I avoid working outside of normal business hours 
as much as possible. I expect the same from my team as well. There’s no 
expectation to work on evenings or weekends. You need to get away from 
work completely in order to recharge. When I occasionally break that rule—
like sending a late-night email, I make it clear to my staff that I don’t expect a 
response until the next business day. I also use color-coding on my calendar 
so I understand upcoming commitments easily.
I also consider my appointments with my staff, such as the weekly team 
meeting, to be engraved in stone. I want my staff to be able to rely on knowing 
when the staff meeting is so that they can plan accordingly. I don’t sacrifice 
that commitment to the staff meeting just because a request comes in from 
somebody else, even if it’s an executive. Likewise, I work to maintain several 
other standing meetings, including one-on-one meetings with my direct 
reports. The next priority level involves interaction with my boss: his staff 
meeting and my one on one with him.
I’ve also learned to delegate and to say “no” more often to stay focused with 
my time. Likewise, I teach my staff to say no to requests. For example, if my 
boss asks to meet with me during the my weekly team meeting, I will say “no” 
and suggest to meet another time.
Harpham: What color categories are you using to organize your calendar 
visually?
Arcari: I have a color for the federal railroad administration—they’re the 
organization that funds the organization. I have another color for my boss. 
I have a color to represent time in transit—when I’m traveling between offices 
or other places—that helps me to decline meetings while I’m in transit. I also  
block an hour for lunch to keep that time for me. I also put personal 
appointments in another color so those are easy to track. Before I leave the 
office at night, I quickly review the next day’s calendar so I have an idea of 
what’s coming up.

287
Harpham: What would you say your biggest productivity challenge is right 
now?
Arcari: Right now, it’s regularly setting aside time for strategic thinking. In 
previous roles, I usually had the opportunity to set aside about an hour a day 
to think, plan and work on strategy. In this role, I haven’t had that opportunity, 
because I’ve been focused on learning the organization and the industry. When 
I regularly take that strategy time, it makes me a better leader.
Harpham: What goes into your strategic-thinking time?
Arcari: I like to start with large Post-it Notes as a thinking tool. With that 
in hand, I start to work through open questions. What do I need to capture? 
What ideas, tasks, and questions do I have to get out of my head? It could be 
work items, personal items—anything that comes to mind. Much of my work 
takes a great deal of thinking time to create, because there are new processes 
and methods to create, like project charters. I often come up with school 
tasks as well since I’m working on a master’s degree right now. In part, it’s a 
way to highlight the most important tasks and concerns that are taking up my 
attention.
Harpham: Are there any other activities that go into these strategic-thinking 
sessions?
Arcari: There are all kinds of topics and questions. For example, I periodically 
review my organization chart and ask myself, “Is this the right structure for what 
we’re being asked to do? Do we need additional talent in the organization?”
Harpham: This is an interesting practice for project managers to think about. 
It’s a reminder that there’s value in setting aside time to explore strategy and 
big questions.
Arcari: In a way, this is anti-project manager behavior. Many project managers 
are “programmed” by habit to think that they have to be achieving tasks all the 
time. One of my earliest bosses taught me, “Sometimes, you need to sit and 
think.” If I omit this thinking time and simply “do, do, do,” life and work start 
to feel more chaotic.
Harpham: Are there any methods that you find helpful to get this strategic-
thinking activity?
Arcari: On occasion, I find it helpful to head off to a coffee shop. By physically 
getting out of the office for half an hour, I can focus on the activity without 
interruptions.

Chapter Summary
• 
A mistake that novice project managers make: Arcari 
notes that some novice project managers make the 
mistake of seeking a guidebook that will address all of 
their questions and applying the PMBOK Guide in its 
entirety to each project.
• 
Early project management inspiration: her parents. 
Arcari’s mother kept the family highly organized. Her 
father shared lessons from his experiences in the US 
Army Corp of Engineers.
• 
Use Project Management Institute (PMI) resources. 
Arcari has benefited from using numerous PMI resources, 
including the PMP certification and job descriptions.
• 
An evolving approach to conflict: Early in her career, Arcari 
avoided conflict. Today, she sees the value in conflict and 
seeks out “negative scanners” who may detect risks in 
the organization.
• 
Navigating industry transitions: Transitioning to the rail 
industry was easier because Arcari led an effort that 
resulted in a PMI award.

Alam is also a visiting faculty member at the School of Mechanical Aerospace and 
Civil Engineering (MACE) of the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom.
Bruce Harpham: How did you first get started in project management?
Mehmood Alam: After my graduation in early 2000, I started my career 
as an aerospace design engineer. In my first job, I designed electronic warfare 
systems installed on a variety of aircraft for the Ministry of Defence.

Chapter 24 | Mehmood Alam, Senior Project Engineer, Costain
290
It was a multi-billion-[British] pound project to develop the design, manufacture, 
production, and installation of an electronic warfare system on military 
aircraft. My focus was on design side of the work. I modeled the mechanical 
units of the system using Pro/ENGINEER and carried out stress analysis using 
ANSYS. As an engineering graduate, I built up my experience and carried 
out technical design work. It was a great opportunity to learn about the 
industry, understand engineering problems, and provide design solutions. My 
role gradually expanded as my project manager involved me in more project 
management activities.
I produced product specifications, proposals, delivery schedules, cost estimates, 
risk registers, and integration plans, and rolled out systems from design 
into production and integration. This included the design and manufacture 
of systems’ prototypes, supplier selection, quality inspections, and factory 
acceptance testing. I conducted post-modification safety and operational 
tests, and flight trials. In addition, I evaluated effectiveness through post flight 
debriefs and systems troubleshooting. I coordinated training sessions for 
users and produced system integration and operator’s manuals. I learned 
the fundamentals of project management on the job with the support of my 
senior managers.
During these years, I developed interest in project management and decided 
to undertake formal education in this discipline and understand more about 
its principles, practices and tools people management, team dynamics, and 
corporate culture and leadership.
Harpham: What was your focus in the aerospace project?
Alam: The systems we designed and produced were integrated in military 
aircraft, namely Mirage. I managed the delivery and integration program of 
these systems.
In this role, I worked on flight lines and got hands-on experience working on 
aircraft and system installation and making them operational for use. These 
military aircraft carry very sensitive aerospace and avionics systems and my 
team and I had to first fully understand the constraints and these systems 
before any change can be made. I developed the procedure for system 
integration in the aircraft. Each aircraft after the modification was subject to 
ground testing and flight trial. It was a very unique experience.
Harpham: This was one of the first projects you worked on. What were 
some of the lessons you learned from something that didn’t go according to 
plan?
Alam: I was working to a very compressed program for system design 
manufacture and integration. I faced several operational issues during system 
integration that impacted our schedule of activities. One of the key lessons for 
me was lack of contingency planning to remediate flight operational issues and

defects/troubleshooting, as I could not hold the aircraft for longer durations 
to rectify the problems. Therefore, a quick management response was always 
required.
Project scope is another classic example of a project management challenge. 
The scope of work was not very well defined and it was a challenge to meet 
the evolving requirements of the client in the given schedule and budget. 
The client came up with a list of requirements and asked us to conduct a 
feasibility design study and suggest a proposal. The lesson I learned from this 
government-funded project was that we should consider all risks pertinent 
to the work and accordingly set up and agree on the type of contract with 
the client. That approach will give a reasonable allowance to accommodate 
changes to scope and budget.
Harpham: The initial request was something like, “We’re looking to improve 
our aircraft technology. What do you have in mind?”
Alam: That’s right. It was a research and development project leading into 
production and integration of new systems for aircraft. We came up with 
various design proposals on what could be done. These aircraft have a certain 
level of capabilities. We started by assessing the aircraft’s existing capabilities 
and then come up with recommendations and a proposal on what to improve.
There was a lot of back-and-forth discussion with the client about the scope. 
At times it was frustrating as the scope of works went into several iterations 
bounded by the constraints of budget. Looking back, I think the contract 
arrangement could have been improved by using a cost reimbursable model 
for such a project.
Harpham: When was the project fully complete? Did you have the opportunity 
to see the systems in production on flying aircraft?
Alam: Yes! We created and tested prototypes to check the functionality. The 
production process was then subcontracted out to three approved suppliers. 
There was a fourth vendor assigned to assemble the system. Given the 
deadlines, we had to run tasks in parallel and work with multiple vendors. It 
was a challenge to ensure that the products are manufactured, produced and 
tested as per the standards and specifications. I led the integration team and 
successfully delivered the system integration program. I carried out system 
integration, conducted modification checks, on-ground testing, and flight trials. 
The project was completed in three years. I was also in charge of the after-
sales product support program and carried out root-cause investigations of 
any problems raised by the client, and accordingly provided solutions.
I felt motivated knowing my little contribution was added to military aircraft 
that are now successfully flying.

Chapter 24 | Mehmood Alam, Senior Project Engineer, Costain
292
Harpham: It sounds like an unexpected aspect on this project was more 
extensive subcontracting than originally planned.
Alam: That’s true. The client had deadlines for the project and we needed 
to meet those dates. Initially, we planned to have one supplier to help us with 
additional knowledge and capacity. We ended up going with multiple vendors. 
As you may imagine, managing multiple vendors is much more difficult—
especially when dealing with aerospace-grade design and manufacture. 
You have to manage them closely to ensure that they meet the project’s 
schedule and quality requirements. The software was developed in-house. The 
manufacture and assembly of mechanical components was undertaken by the 
vendors. Electrical systems were provided by us, and their integration and final 
quality check was conducted by the vendors. FAT [factory acceptance testing] 
were conducted by our quality inspectors.
Harpham: When you began to study project management, what were some 
insights you discovered or blind spots you overcame?
Alam: My project management studies filled in several knowledge gaps. For 
instance, I learned much more about contracts, their types, and their use in 
different project situations. Commercial management was not something I had 
covered in my engineering studies.
Regarding quality, I learned much more about the way to approach quality 
management on projects. My understanding of project quality had been based 
on the idea of adapting and reusing quality plans from previous projects at 
the company. I also learned how to quantify and better manage project risks 
and project controls, including estimating, planning, and monitoring tools and 
techniques.
The course I took on people and organizations stands out to me. I learned 
about the business psychology and organizational behavior. The hard sciences 
of project management—schedule management, project controls, and 
budgets—were easy to grasp. My greatest challenge was people management. 
I was interested to learn about intrinsic motivation factors that drive people. 
I was also interested to learn how to become a better leader—when to 
delegate and when to become more assertive.
Harpham: Regarding developing your interpersonal skills, what are some of 
the strategies you’ve learned?
Alam: I developed my interpersonal skills over the years while working 
on various projects. I learned to bring composure to the team and adopt 
appropriate leadership style during meetings to ensure that the team 
remained well-engaged and focused in the process. On occasions when I feel 
that the brainstorming is not leading in the right direction, I learned to be 
more assertive and maintain the focus of the discussion.

Project Managers at Work
293
I believe in teamwork and valuing people regardless of their culture and 
background. I have been in situations where I have had to manage personal 
issues such as holidays and grievances. Project conflicts are another important 
consideration. I manage these philosophical issues by understanding the 
underlying cause, collaborating as much as possible and acting assertively as 
required. For example, I challenged the way progress was being reported on 
the National Grid FEED project. I directed all leads to provide weekly updates 
to the planner so a better refection of earned value could be obtained.
An important part of working life is understanding the limits of my own 
knowledge, and while I strive to improve my level of understanding, I pro-actively 
seek help and advice from colleagues when appropriate. I have disseminated 
my expertise to other staff and this is evident from their development and 
progression.
Harpham: As an engineer, you rely on your expertise to solve problems. 
When you move to a project manager role, you will be working with different 
experts, such as legal experts. In that case, you may not understand the details 
of their profession but you still have to work them to achieve the project’s 
goals. How do you adjust to this new role?
Alam: Yes. In my present role, I face this challenge. My background is mechanical 
engineering. I’ve moved to new industries over time—from aerospace to 
nuclear and then oil and gas. My project management capabilities together 
with my engineering and design background have enabled me to succeed in 
these different industries. Project management knowledge gives you the ability 
to diversify your career and work in different roles and industries.
Harpham: How did you change industries? At first glance, aerospace and 
nuclear are quite different.
Alam: The first five years or so of my career were focused on the aerospace 
industry. Over that time, I shifted from a traditional engineering role to an 
engineering and project management role involving interaction with clients, 
keeping them satisfied, understanding their requirements and getting them 
delivered through my team while ensuring that my cost, time, quality, and 
safety targets are achieved.
I realized that I was doing a project management role rather than a very 
technical role, though my engineering knowledge and experience helped me 
a lot to deliver as a project manager. These project management skills are 
transferable—to a large degree—to other industries. The diversification in 
experience equipped me to switch between industries.
Changing to nuclear and subsequently into oil and gas wasn’t very difficult for 
me given my background of engineering and design, and project management. 
The roles I took in these industries were project engineering and project 
management related, which I fully equipped myself with the key competencies 
to deliver projects successfully.

Chapter 24 | Mehmood Alam, Senior Project Engineer, Costain
294
Harpham: In the nuclear industry, risk management is a major concern.  
A poorly managed risk in the nuclear industry can lead to devastating results. 
What has been your approach to systematically and effectively manage risk 
on nuclear projects?
Alam: Safety is a top concern in the nuclear as well as in the oil and gas 
industry. Through each and every component and activity, safety is critical. I am 
well placed to understand the importance of safety because I have come from 
the aerospace background, where safety is one of the fundamental concerns 
in all work we do. I worked on nuclear projects related to safety cases, fault 
studies, radiological analysis, software development, plant boilers, and fuel 
cycle optimization and most recently on gas compression stations.
I ensure that all design work is conducted to relevant engineering standards 
and specifications. All engineering design work is checked and reviewed before 
it is released. Engineering design assessments are carried out and the design is 
subject to a gated process before it is released for construction. The selection 
of only approved contractors is carried out and vendors delivering equipment 
comply with the defined standards and specifications and deliver as per the 
Inspection and Test Plans. I ensure that a robust project health and safety file 
is set out for the project. All risks recorded in the technical risk register are 
either designed out through the project or transferred over the client on the 
residual risk register for consideration during operations. All these controls 
enable me to lead the development and delivery of a safe design for our client.
Harpham: Even a small change may be simple on its own. Yet that change 
may have second-order or third-order consequences on safety.
Alam: I concur. The work I do involves the design and construction of 
national assets, such as petrochemical plants and compressor stations. Safety 
by design is considered a top priority for me while delivering these projects. 
The cause and effect of every change instigated by the project is considered 
before its implementation.
Harpham: Let’s turn to your project management awards from the 
International Project Management Association. How did you achieve that 
award and what are the implications for your career?
Alam: I’m a member of various project management associations and 
bodies, such as APM [The Association of Project Management, a UK Project 
Management Professional organization], the International Project Management 
Association [IPMA], the Project Management Institute [PMI], and Institute of 
Mechanical Engineers [IMechE] UK.
I have won two international awards to-date. The International Project 
Management Association [IPMA] Young Researcher award was given on the 
recognition of my doctoral research work in 2011.

My research established the widely debated link between investment in project 
management education and benefits to individuals, projects, business units, 
and the corporate level. The investigation process examined the viability of 
the five-level Philips [2003] ROI model from a business perspective. However, 
the extent to which there is a financial return arising from professional 
development programs is difficult to assess and this brings into question 
the applicability of Level 5 of the ROI model. The overriding success of this 
research is the pathway that equates investment with the Return on Value 
[ROV] concept providing a more pragmatic approach for the assessment of 
continuing professional development (CPD) programs.
The IPMA Young Project Manager of the Year Award was given to me in 2014 
based upon my achievements in delivering projects successfully.
I was very pleased to win this prestigious award. It’s a great honor for me and 
my company. The IPMA is the world’s largest professional project management 
body, so this is recognition on an international scale.
I encourage project managers to join the IPMA and enter for the award and 
IPMA certification programs. It’s a great platform on which to build your career.
Harpham: What are your personal productivity strategies to stay organized 
and productive?
Alam: Every day is different for me. I don’t follow a particular pattern each 
day. My role demands engagement in many meetings, internally with the team 
and with the client. This sometimes affects my daily work. I manage this 
by prioritizing and planning my time for essential meetings only where my 
involvement is essential.
Earlier in my career, I tended to do all of my work personally. Over time, I 
have become better at delegating and empowering others on the team to get 
work done. As a result, I have the capacity to focus on issues that are best 
suited for me to work on, such as managing stakeholders, project teams, and/
or technical project issues.
Harpham: What is your approach to delegation?
Alam: I’ll give you an example from my current project in the oil/gas sector.
I manage a team that includes recent graduates and lead engineers with 
extensive experience. When someone joins my team, I provide additional 
support to ensure that they know the project organization and work involved. 
I also make sure that the lead engineer or another senior engineer of the 
relevant discipline is available to provide support to the new team member. 
As the new person demonstrates his or her ability on the project, I gradually 
give him/her more responsibility and autonomy. If the person joining the team 
is highly experienced, I take a somewhat different approach and delegate, 
but I still take the time to express my expectations and explain their job 
requirements and facilitate as needed.

Chapter 24 | Mehmood Alam, Senior Project Engineer, Costain
296
Harpham: Let’s turn to career development. What advice would you give 
to readers who are interested in breaking into the project management field?
Alam: I have presented a few seminars on this topic to the University of 
Manchester about my career journey from engineer to project management. 
People come into project management from different backgrounds. It’s not 
required that you come from a specific discipline.
It’s important to take the time and effort to understand the industry and 
domain context of the project. If you take a new graduate from an MBA 
program and tell them to run an oil and gas engineering and design project, I 
don’t think they will be able to succeed. In my experience, it is a good idea to 
start by building your domain or industry experience and subsequently move 
into project management. On the engineering projects I work on, the project 
manager is expected to already have the knowledge and understanding of the 
engineering fundamentals, the design process and construction works. You are 
not expected to know every detail as the person leading the project, but you 
are expected to know the basics.
In my view, a technical background or profession gives you a good foundation 
to lead and manage engineering and design and construction projects.
Coming into project management gives you more diversity and variety in your 
career. Often, you have a greater opportunity to get promoted to higher levels 
of responsibility relatively more quickly. You get a sense of what is required 
to manage and lead people from different disciplines.
Harpham: How has your leadership strategy evolved over time?
Alam: I gradually developed my leadership skills over time. I have learned to 
adjust my approach based on the context. In some cases, I have to be assertive 
and take charge. In other cases, I lean back so that others can take the lead. 
There’s a difference between a manager and a leader. If you’re a leader, your 
people look up to you and take confidence from your approach. A key factor 
for leaders is the ability to inspire the team to work on a common goal. 
However, I recognize that leadership is an ongoing effort—I am always seeking 
to improve my ability to lead.
Harpham: What trends and opportunities do you think will be most 
significant to project management in your environment over the next three 
to five years?
Alam: Given that client organizations have limited budget expenditures due 
to current oil and gas market conditions, innovation and moving away from 
traditional ways of engineering design, management and delivery are greatly 
emphasized.

Project Managers at Work
297
Harpham: What books have you found most valuable in supporting your 
professional development?
Alam: For engineers and project managers, I would recommend the 
following books: A Guide to Project Management The Wiley Guide to Managing 
Projects by Peter Morris and Jeffrey Pinto [Wiley, 2004], Business Psychology and 
Organisational Behaviour by Eugene McKenna [Psychology Press, 2006] and, 
The Innovator's DNA: Mastering the Five Skills of Disruptive Innovators by Hal B. 
Gregersen, Clayton M. Christensen, 2011].
Chapter Summary

Lesson learned: A disciplined approach to managing 
project scope is critical. Small changes add up over time.
• 
Vendor management: Alam has managed multiple vendors 
in complex projects. This is a critical skillset, especially for 
larger projects.
• 
How to change industries: Alam has succeeded across 
several industries as he developed his leadership and 
project management skills. Grow these skills to increase 
your career options and flexibility.
•

successful project delivery across the capital investment program. She has worked 
extensively with organizations across the globe to assess and develop their organi-
zational project management capabilities. Prior to her role at Telstra, Aitken held 
the position of CEO at Human Systems International, which was acquired by the 
Project Management Institute in 2013. Her experience ranges through several indus-
tries, including telecommunications, banking and finance, defense and aerospace, 
­pharmaceutical, engineering and construction, mining, oil and gas, and government.
Aitken is actively involved in several industry groups and peak bodies. She holds a 
PhD in project management and psychology from Bond University, with a particular 
focus on how project managers cope with stress. She is a regular keynote speaker at 
conferences around the world and contributes to academic programs at universities 
in both Australia and Europe. 
Bruce Harpham: How did you get started in your career? 
Alicia Aitken: Before becoming chief project officer at Telstra, I ran several 
companies. My first business was selling specialty coffee online. I started selling 
directly to consumers and then expanded into wholesale distribution for 
Australia and Asia. Later on, I expanded into offering online training for the 
coffee industry.
The next business was a web development company. It was back in the days 
when almost anybody could be a web developer. Through that work, I learned 
about the PhD research carried out by Dr. Lynn Crawford. We then went 
25

into business together to create a project manager competency assessment 
company. The company offered an online self-assessment and follow-up 
process, which grew into a registered training organization in Australia with 
a global client base. We did assessments and benchmark work for project 
managers in large organizations. 
Dr. Crawford was also running another business that focused on organizational 
development activities for project management. We eventually merged the 
assessment business and the organizational development business together. 
As a result, I took over Human Systems International’s Asia-Pacific business.
In 2013, we sold the Human Systems International business to the Project 
Management Institute. Shortly after the sale, Telstra approached me and 
invited me to serve as their chief project officer. It was a brand-new role for 
the organization.
Harpham: How did you get into the coffee business? 
Aitken: During my undergraduate studies in business, I was curious to know 
if the models and theories being taught would apply to the business world. 
The best way to test those ideas is to actually run a business. My best friend 
was working at a local specialty coffee roaster company. At this time, specialty 
coffee was an emerging niche—Australia was moving from instant coffee to 
barista-made coffee. She mentioned to me that the company’s owners were 
interested in expanding online, but they didn’t quite know how to get started.
I approached the owners of the company and offered to do the work for free 
if they would give me exclusive rights to sell their product online. They said 
yes! I started this business in the late 1990s, before many of the services and 
infrastructure that support ecommerce were in place. 
Harpham: How did you transition into your next business?
Aitken: I kept the coffee business going while I built the web development 
business. As we started up the project management business, I also kept those 
companies going. In total, I was running three businesses concurrently. When 
I started my PhD, I realized that I needed to make some adjustments to my 
workload in order to complete the PhD. I ended up selling the coffee business 
to a friend in the coffee industry. The web development business was taken 
over by another friend of mine who was in that industry. 
Harpham: Let’s turn to the project management assessment business. How 
did you obtain the first few clients for that business?
Aitken: We were commercializing academic research. As a result, we had 
several companies and government agencies who had participated in the 
research. The research participants became our first clients once we developed 
the first commercial offering. I then went out and sold the product.

One of our first large customers was one of Australia’s largest banks. They 
were going through a transition from decentralized to centralized project 
management. The company was interested in assessing the capabilities of their 
project managers. With that success, we were able to continue selling the 
service to other customers. 
Harpham: What were your clients seeking to achieve by working with you?
Aitken: Most of the clients were searching for the root cause of project 
failure. They had a theory that bad or incompetent project managers might be 
the cause. The first question from the client might be something like, “Could 
you come in and tell me which of my project managers are good and which are 
bad?” Without fail, the assessment process would find some project managers 
who needed development. On the whole, most of the organization’s project 
managers were fundamentally competent. We found organizational problems 
and systemic issues that prevented project success. 
Harpham: Clients assume they know the answer—we have incompetent 
project managers—and you respond by telling them a different answer—
organizational issues are a bigger problem. How did those conversations play 
out?
Aitken: One of the advantages to having an assessment business is that 
you take the opinion out of the conversation. Therefore, the conversation 
is fact based and you can point to the evidence to discuss. When you’re in 
an opinion-based conversation about project success and capabilities, it’s he 
said, she said. It’s hard to make forward progress in that environment. If you 
take the emotion out of it and focus on the data, you can better understand 
the problem. That puts both of you in the position of solving the problem in  
a constructive way.
Harpham: What were some of the patterns you observed in terms of the 
dysfunctional environment?
Aitken: Lack of sponsor engagement was a common theme. A lack of 
continuous professional development for project managers was another theme. 
It’s important to set the standard that project management is a profession 
that requires training, specific skills, and continuous development. I also found  
a lack of clarity in terms of what is expected of the project manager.
Harpham: What was the focus of your PhD studies?
Aitken: My research focused on the question—how do project managers 
cope with stress? I’ve long had an interest in psychology and the human aspect 
of project management. Interestingly, I found that project managers use similar 
strategies across their approach to work, home, and personal health. That’s 
unusual compared to most other populations. For example, other populations 
may have problem-focused coping at work and emotion-focused coping at 
home. 

Chapter 25 | Alicia Aitken, Chief Project Officer, Telstra
302
Project managers tend to start with an acceptance attitude, an emotion-
focused coping mechanism. Next, they use problem-solving coping and start to 
create a plan. The acceptance point was an unexpected discovery. In essence, 
this means the person realizes that “Something horrible is happening to me 
that I do not control. Despite that fact, I am going to face the problem and 
make a plan to get out of it.”
Much project management work is focused on gaining control over our world. 
Therefore, I had assumed that people would feel in control and use problem-
focused coping. I was surprised to find that project managers accept the reality 
of the situation and then make a plan to address it. It’s quite heroic! 
Harpham: Let’s turn to your current role. What is your objective as the 
chief project officer at Telstra? 
Aitken: It’s a new role that was introduced about two years ago. In its first 
incarnation, the role is focused on serving as a change leader. That means a 
person who can inspire the organization to go on a journey of creating project 
management as a standalone capability. That means a capability separate from 
other areas, like IT and engineering.
Let’s take a moment to define the organization’s structure. Telstra has over 
thirty thousand employees working in more than twenty countries around the 
world. For project management, we have a decentralized model. Our project 
managers are spread among the organization’s business units.
The first goal was to create a community of project delivery practitioners. 
I measure success in that area by how many people attend the events, training, 
and the other offerings we have. We also carry out a pulse survey to explore 
how project managers feel about the organization, their sponsor, and other 
points.
The next goal is to create a group of effective executive project sponsors. 
It’s important to have good project managers. However, the other side of 
the project delivery success coin is to have good project sponsors. This 
development effort guides executives on how to run steering committees and 
make good decisions about projects.
The final goal concerns the success of our project delivery. We use several 
benchmarks and metrics to measure how successful we are at delivering 
projects. When I started, we carried out a baseline exercise to evaluate our 
success. Today—about eighteen months after that initial baseline—we are 
measuring our success.
Harpham: What were some of the findings from that initial baseline analysis 
when you joined the organization?

Project Managers at Work
303
Aitken: Like many organizations, we had a number of solid project management 
practices in place. There was also an emerging portfolio management practice. 
We choose to make our focus on professionalizing our project managers and 
capabilities. We want to make sure that those who fell into the project manager 
role “accidentally” develop the capabilities to become effective professionals. 
That professionalization activity was carried out through a combination of 
training, certification, and engaging the organization’s executive sponsors. In 
addition, we are interested in advancing our portfolio, investment, and benefits 
management processes.
Harpham: What is the organization’s approach to benefits management?
Aitken: Our business cases have both tangible and non-tangible benefits. We 
track all of those benefits. The final gate in our gating process—gate 5—takes 
place six to twelve months after the project has closed. During that time, we 
do a review of the benefits that were achieved and what was planned. To assist 
with this work, we have a permanent team that owns and manages the “gate 
5” process on benefits management in cooperation with the business owner 
of the project. We don’t rely on the project manager to do this work. After 
all, they are usually long gone and leading a different project. 
Harpham: It’s interesting to hear that there’s a dedicated team that looks at 
benefits achieved and measuring project success.
Aitken: That capability is one of our strengths. At the same time, I’m aware 
of other areas where there is still a lot of room to grow.
Harpham: Let’s explore intangible benefits and how these are measured. 
Some organizations struggle with how to define these benefits and determine 
if they have been achieved. What’s your approach to intangible benefits?
Aitken: Customer satisfaction is one example of an intangible benefit. We 
measure that by using the Net Promoter Score method. The other major 
intangible is brand protection or reputation. Though it is important, it is 
relatively more difficult to manage. 
Harpham: How might a project impact the brand positively or negatively?
Aitken: On the negative side, if a project introduced a new product and it 
somehow caused a problem for the whole network, that would result in a 
negative brand impact. In terms of positive brand impact, a recently introduced 
product comes to mind. The product is called Telstra Smart Home—it’s 
our Internet of Things product. That was a brand-enhancing project. That 
product also connects the organization’s overall strategy to transform from 
a ­world-class telecom company into a world-class technology company. 

Chapter 25 | Alicia Aitken, Chief Project Officer, Telstra
304
Harpham: What does the Telstra Smart Home product do exactly?
Aitken: It is a way to manage and access various technologies in the home, 
such as home security cameras, having a door to lock or unlock remotely, 
turn power switches on and off, and so forth. You can carry out all of these 
functions from a smart phone application.
Harpham: Turning back to your work, what does a typical workweek look 
like for you?
Aitken: I have two teams to manage. I have a delivery team of ten people 
who deliver large projects. In addition, I have a capability team that carries out 
functions like training, sponsor training, and so forth. Wi-Fi Nation is one of 
the larger programs we currently working on. The goal is to create the world’s 
largest Wi-Fi network, which includes creating public Wi-Fi hotspots around 
the country.
Harpham: What is your approach for developing project capabilities with 
the organization’s executives? 
Aitken: The most important thing is to do the pre-work before you even 
attempt the conversation. I spent the first twelve to eighteen months delivering 
projects for our executives. During that time, I made an effort to get to know 
them and develop my relationships.
I also spent a lot of time seeking to understand how they like to learn. I was 
also curious to learn about their career journey. I learned that our executives 
like to learn by observing and modeling other executives. They prefer this 
modeling approach to taking traditional courses. They often look around for 
other executives to see who is good with a given activity, and then model that 
activity. At the same time, they also learn from observing what not to do. All 
of these insights fed into our sponsor capability program.
Taking the time to understand our executives and how they learn was a key 
factor in the success of our executive training program.
Harpham: It sounds like the traditional training model would not have been 
suitable. Can you elaborate further on the modeling idea?
Aitken: I learned that this group of people would likely not be interested 
in attending a training session. Likewise, they would probably not respond to 
mandates, rules, and similar methods. They’re very smart people and they’re 
able to learn their project responsibilities quickly. They don’t need a lot of 
intervention.
What executives do need is exposure to new ideas and new ways of working. 
The challenge for me and my team is to come up with ways to present those 
ideas effectively. We have addressed the challenge with several interventions.

305
Harpham: I’ve noted that you discuss training and development activities 
with the term “interventions.” Can you elaborate on your approach further?
Aitken: Our interventions are somewhat personalized. At the time, we have 
to create interventions that serve the needs of more than three hundred 
executives. One successful approach has been to ask an executive, with a 
strong track record of sponsoring projects, to give a presentation to other 
executives. We’ve also had events where our deputy CFO and executives 
from other companies come together to discuss project issues. We have also 
brought in former executives who know serve on boards to provide their 
perspective—I like to think of them as “uber-sponsors.”
We have also created resources, such as a sponsor handbook. This is a 
reference document that covers key questions that experienced project 
sponsors tend to ask. For example, how much should my PMO cost? Which 
people should attend this forum meeting? Executives generally do not want to 
ask these kind of basic questions publicly. Therefore, it is helpful to give them 
this resource, which they can study. 2017 is the year of the project sponsor at 
Telstra. All year, our focus is providing support and assistance to our sponsors 
to help them on their journey.
Harpham: What mistakes do you see as a recurring pattern for the project 
managers you interact with?
Aitken: The biggest problem is project managers forgetting to lead their 
projects. When that happens, project managers fall into administrative tasks. 
With project management, we have a lot of useful processes that we use to 
guide our work. If that process is pushed to the front and that’s all anybody 
sees, it is easy to dismiss project management as an administrative function. 
Truly, project management is about leading the execution of strategy.
Harpham: What is the cause for this tendency to overemphasize administrative 
activities?
Aitken: Two points come to mind. First, project managers understand the 
value of project processes. As a result, project managers are highly skilled 
and comfortable using those processes. However, we do not understand how 
that process emphasis is perceived by other people outside of the project 
management world.
Second, there’s also pressure from non-project managers. These people 
don’t know what to expect from their project managers. If they see a project 
manager focused on administrative activities, they may think to themselves, 
“Oh, this is a person who does my admin. I’ll give them more work to do like 
that.” Then you quickly end up in a catch-22 scenario—you do a bit of admin 
work and then you are given more of that to do. Soon, you have no time or 
capacity to act as the project leader. Instead of being perceived as a leader, you 
are perceived as an administrator.

Chapter 25 | Alicia Aitken, Chief Project Officer, Telstra
306
Harpham: Let’s look at leadership from the perspective of influence and 
relationships. What was your approach to relationship development when 
you joined the company?
Aitken: I have a fundamental belief that nobody is going to follow you into the 
abyss if they don’t first know and like you. My first few months were focused 
on going to meet people. I thought of this as “making friends at Telstra.” In 
meeting new people at the organization, I wanted to let them know about 
my role and find ways to help them. I found it effective to ask people how I 
could help them, rather than telling them. During these months, I put in a lot 
of effort to travel to various offices in order to meet people face to face. This 
stage was all about building rapport.
The next stage was to find ways to work with as many executives as I could. 
I started to interact with some executives directly through project work—
they were serving as project sponsors for projects led by my delivery team. 
However, there were many other executives that we couldn’t deliver a project 
for because we were at capacity.
I used a wide range of strategies to find ways to work with other executives. 
For example, I looked for opportunities to take on extra work myself. Through 
doing that work, I had the capability to build their trust and deliver for them. 
One executive was working on setting up a new business unit—they needed 
a CapEx function created. I offered to do that work for them. It turned out to 
become a second job for me! There was a lot of effort involved—above and 
beyond my “day job”—to find those opportunities.
I also found it helpful to get involved in volunteer activities and groups at 
the company. For example, we have a Brilliant Connected Women’s group, a 
diversity council, and other groups. By participating on the diversity council, 
I had the opportunity to build a relationship with other executives and work 
with them to deliver on the organization’s diversity agenda. 
Beyond those activities, I also went out for coffee meetings and other informal 
ways to get to know them.
Harpham: I noticed a few key aspects to your approach. You had the 
awareness to realize that there would be a limit to how many executives you 
would meet through your main responsibilities. Therefore, you knew you had 
to proactively reach out, travel to other locations, and look for these other 
opportunities.
Aitken: Yes. I knew the executives needed me, but they didn’t know I existed 
when I first joined the organization. Therefore, the chance of them coming 
to ask for help was limited at first. You have to put in the effort to create 
awareness.

Harpham: Let’s look at your career journey. You had started your career 
in the entrepreneurial or self-employed area and then moved to join a large 
organization. How did you navigate through that transition?
Aitken: I was up front with my first boss at Telstra. We actually created a 
risk register concerning my transition to the company. On that register, I listed 
the fact that I had never worked for a large company. As a result, I might find 
the pace of change frustrating. Likewise, I might not have the political skills to 
effect change in a large organization. Another risk was that the company might 
not like my approach to getting things done. We talked about those risks 
during our one-on-one meetings. 
The large corporate world was an unknown territory for me. As it turns 
out, I love working in a large organization. It’s great to have access to so 
many different people who bring such a variety of ideas to work. I find that 
variety of ideas and people highly stimulating. All of the skills I had developed 
in managing people in my own companies translated well to the corporate 
world. However, I had to learn my way around the various systems used in the 
company: HR systems, procurement systems, and so forth.
My consulting and sales skills have been a tremendous asset in my success 
at the company. Selling ideas inside a company is much easier than selling a 
product and getting someone to part with their money. It’s actually the same 
skill set, but doing that process inside the company is much easier.
Harpham: It’s interesting to see the risk register practice applied to the 
context of a career transition. You’re showing that project processes and 
methods can be used in other contexts.
Aitken: It’s a conversation I’ve been having lately with various people. At 
Telstra, project management is a specific discipline for managing projects. 
However, the principles of project management have great life applications.
Harpham: What is your approach to leadership? 
Aitken: Leadership is a privileged position to be in. If you’re going to lead 
people into the unknown, recognize that you’re asking them to go into a scary 
place. As a leader, you have an obligation to do lead with respect and trust. 
This work requires self-awareness about your own emotions and the ability 
to keep yourself in check. I like people to work with me rather than for me.
Harpham: What techniques and methods are part of your personal 
productivity system?
Aitken: It starts with having a clear operating model for the year. In a way, 
I think of each year’s goals as a large project. What are the major work 
packages? When will those be done? Once that overall plan is set up, it is 
helpful to have a number of checkpoints. I like to have weekly or fortnightly 

Chapter 25 | Alicia Aitken, Chief Project Officer, Telstra
308
one to one meetings with each person on my team, so you can understand the 
team’s progress. By setting the broad goals and schedule, you can then leave 
people to come up with the best way to achieve those ends.
In terms of time management, this is still a journey for me. For this year, 
I’ve started to block out time for certain activities on my calendar. My ideal 
approach is to break my work time into thirds. One third of my time focuses 
on supporting the delivery team. The second third of my team is focused on 
the capability team. Finally, the last third of my time is focused on building for 
the future—either for my team or the company more broadly. For example, 
what projects and programs are planned for the future? What capabilities will 
we need in the future to achieve our strategy?
Harpham: How is the time management system applied in practice?
Aitken: Looking at the last month or two, I would estimate that I’m about 
sixty-five percent successful with adhering to this schedule. This year has been 
better than other years because I’ve made a conscious effort to focus.
Harpham: What books have you found professionally valuable?
Aitken: I recently read Why Should Anyone Be Led by You?: What It Takes to Be 
an Authentic Leader by Gareth R. Jones and Robert Goffee [Harvard Business 
Review Press, 2015]. It was recommended to me by the deputy CFO. The 
book itself was great. I’m still thinking about the question in the book title.
Harpham: What advice would you give to someone who is looking to break 
into project management from another role?
Aitken: There are two streams of work to consider in making this transition 
happen. First, pursue training and certification—take courses and build skills 
through project management courses. Second, networking is critical. Making 
a transition into your first project management job is difficult because you’ve 
got to convince someone to give you a job that you haven’t done before. 
In order to find an opportunity, you need a network that includes potential 
employers and a person who is willing to take a risk on you.
The training and certification part is relatively easy. You just need to spend 
time and money to learn the knowledge. In contrast, people seem to struggle 
with networking. This activity may include going out for coffee with new 
people or cold calling for new opportunities.
Harpham: The networking point is so valuable and yet it is underappreciated. 
In my alumni volunteer work at the University of Toronto, I regularly encourage 
students to put $50 on a Starbucks card and then take professionals out 
to coffee for three months. That activity will pay huge dividends, yet almost 
nobody will do it. At the same time, students are willing to spend tens of 
thousands of dollars to earn the degree.
Aitken: Exactly!
