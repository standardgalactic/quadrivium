DNS Namespace
DNS Namespace
•
Hierarchical name space
•
Each node in tree represents
domain/subdomain
•
Some subdomains are defined
as zones
•
Each zone has a “primary”
name server responsible for
all lower nodes
•
Resource records (RR) are defined
for each node
•
Example RRs are: Address (A),
pointer (PTR), mail exchange (MX),
name server (NS), start of
authority (SOA)

DNS Queries
DNS Queries
• Clients query local DNS
server for IP addresses
• Local server starts with
the root name server and
recursively queries DNS
servers until it finds a
server that has the answer
• Local servers send
answers back to the
clients and cache
the answers

DNS Redundancy
DNS Redundancy
•
Redundancy is built into DNS
•
Secondary servers automatically
backup primary servers
•
Secondary servers check the
primary for changes in the zone
serial number
•
Updates controlled by the
refresh rate in SOA record
for zone
•
Use Notify and Incremental Zone
Transfers to reduce propagation
delay and bandwidth utilization
•
Spread secondary and caching
DNS servers liberally
throughout the network
Old Zone Transfer
1. Secondary Checks the Serial
Number of the Zone
2. If It Has Changed, Secondary
Requests a Zone Transfer
3. Primary Sends the Entire
Zone to Secondary

1. Secondary Checks the Serial

Large Campus
•
Large campus networks require
high-performance, redundant DNS
and DHCP servers to support
multiple 10,000s of nodes
•
The server functions need to be
split across multiple servers in
a cluster
•
Build a cluster with at least three
servers, one primary DNS and two
redundant DHCP servers. An
additional DNS server can used to
provide secondary DNS service
•
DNS servers need high
performance disk I/O (preferably a
RAID system) to keep up with
dynamic DNS updates
•
Each major location around the
world—U.S., Europe and Asia
needs a cluster

•
Organizations with a large
number of remote branch
offices with a UNIX or NT
server at each remote site.
Typically 20-200 nodes/site
•
At each of the remote sites,
an organization should
deploy at least one DNS and
DHCP server, two for
redundancy. The redundant
DHCP server could be at HQ
•
Each location could have a
separate domain for the site
and a primary DNS server at
the location. This depends
on the WAN bandwidth
•
This configuration survives
WAN outages
