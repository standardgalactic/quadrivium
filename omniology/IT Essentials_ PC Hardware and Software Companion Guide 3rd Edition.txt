IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide

Introduction
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide, Third Edition, is a supple-
mental book to the Cisco Networking Academy IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software
version 4 course. The course teaches you how to build a computer and troubleshoot prob-
lems that occur in everyday use. The course is designed to prepare you to take and pass the
CompTIA A+ exams (based on the 2006 objectives). By reading and completing this book,
you have the opportunity to review all key concepts that the CompTIA A+ exams cover. If
you use this book along with its companion IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs
and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6), you can reinforce those concepts
with hands-on exercises and test that knowledge with review questions and exercises.
The IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software course is divided into two main units. The
first unit, covered in Chapters 1 through 10, goes over the foundational knowledge that
aligns with the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam (220-601). The second unit, covered in
Chapters 11 through 16, explores more advanced concepts in greater depth to prepare you
for the specialized CompTIA A+ technician exams (220-602 for IT Technician, 220-603 for
Remote Support Technician, and 220-604 for Bench Technician). You must pass both the
A+ Essentials and one of the technician exams to earn the A+ certification.

How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into 16 chapters, one appendix, and a glossary of key terms:
■Chapter 1, “Introduction to the Personal Computer”: Information technology (IT)
is the design, development, implementation, support, and management of computer
hardware and software applications. An IT professional is knowledgeable about com-
puter systems and operating systems. This chapter will review IT certifications and the
components of a basic personal computer system.
■Chapter 2, “Safe Lab Procedures and Tool Use”: This chapter covers basic safety
practices for the workplace, hardware and software tools, and the disposal of hazardous
materials. Safety guidelines help protect individuals from accidents and injury and
xxxii
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide

protect equipment from damage. Some of these guidelines are designed to protect the
environment from contamination by discarded materials. Stay alert to situations that
could result in injury or damage to equipment. Warning signs are designed to alert you
to danger. Always watch for these signs and take the appropriate action according to
the warning given.
■Chapter 3, “Computer Assembly—Step by Step”: The first step in the assembly
process is gathering the components and completing the computer inventory. Preparing
and installing the components are detailed in a step-by-step process. In the final steps,
you review the checklist, assemble the case, and boot the system for the first time.
Assembling computers is a large part of a technician’s job. As a technician, you will
need to work in a logical, methodical manner when working with computer compo-
nents. As with any learned trade, computer assembly skills will improve dramatically
with practice.
■Chapter 4, “Basics of Preventive Maintenance and Troubleshooting”: This chapter
introduces preventive maintenance and the troubleshooting process. Preventive mainte-
nance is a regular and systematic inspection, cleaning, and replacement of worn parts,
materials, and systems. Preventive maintenance helps to prevent failure of parts, mate-
rials, and systems by ensuring that they are in good working order. Troubleshooting is a
systematic approach to locating the cause of a fault in a computer system. A good pre-
ventive maintenance program helps minimize failures. With fewer failures, there is less
troubleshooting to do, thus saving an organization time and money.
■Chapter 5, “Fundamental Operating Systems”: The operating system (OS) controls
almost all functions on a computer. In this chapter, you will learn about the compo-
nents, functions, and terminology related to the Windows 2000 and Windows XP oper-
ating systems.
■Chapter 6, “Fundamental Laptops and Portable Devices”: Laptops, personal digital
assistants (PDA), and smartphones are becoming more popular as their prices decrease
and technology continues to progress. As a computer technician, you need to have
knowledge of portable devices of all kinds. This chapter focuses on the differences
between laptops and desktops and describes the features of PDAs and smartphones.
■Chapter 7, “Fundamental Printers and Scanners”: This chapter will provide essen-
tial information about printers and scanners. You will learn how printers operate, what
to consider when purchasing a printer, and how to connect printers to an individual
computer or to a network. You must understand the operation of various types of print-
ers and scanners to be able to install and maintain them, as well as troubleshoot any
problems that might arise.
■Chapter 8, “Fundamental Networks”: This chapter will provide an overview of net-
work principles, standards, and purposes. The different types of network topologies,
protocols, and logical models, as well as the hardware needed to create a network, will
also be discussed in this chapter. Configuration, troubleshooting, and preventive
xxxiii

maintenance will be covered. You will also learn about network software, communica-
tion methods, and hardware relationships.
■Chapter 9, “Fundamental Security”: Technicians need to understand computer and
network security. Failure to implement proper security procedures can have an impact
on users, computers, and the general public. Private information, company secrets,
financial data, computer equipment, and items of national security are placed at risk if
proper security procedures are not followed. This chapter will cover why security is
important, security threats, security procedures, and how to troubleshoot security
issues.
■Chapter 10, “Communication Skills”: As a computer technician, you will not only
fix computers but also interact with people. In fact, troubleshooting is as much about
communicating with the customer as it is about knowing how to fix a computer. In this
chapter, you will learn to use good communication skills as confidently as you use a
screwdriver.
■Chapter 11, “Advanced Personal Computers”: In your career as a technician, you
might have to determine whether a component for a customer’s computer should be
upgraded or replaced. It is important that you develop advanced skills in installation
procedures, troubleshooting techniques, and diagnostic methods for computers. This
chapter discusses the importance of component compatibility across hardware and soft-
ware. It also covers the need for adequate system resources to efficiently run the cus-
tomer’s hardware and software.
■Chapter 12, “Advanced Operating Systems”: The installation, configuration, and
optimization of operating systems are examined in greater detail in this chapter. There
are various brands of operating systems on the market today, including Microsoft
Windows, Apple Mac OS, UNIX, and Linux. A technician must consider the current
computer system when selecting an operating system. Each of these operating systems
offers many of the same features with a similar interface. However, some functions
necessary for specific customer needs might not be available in all of them. You must
be able to compare and contrast operating systems to find the best one based on your
customer’s needs.
■Chapter 13, “Advanced Laptops and Portable Devices”: With the increase in
demand for mobility, the popularity of laptops and portable devices will continue to
grow. During the course of your career, you will be expected to know how to configure,
repair, and maintain these devices. The knowledge you acquire about desktop comput-
ers will help you service laptops and portable devices. However, there are important
differences between the two technologies.
■Chapter 14, “Advanced Printers and Scanners”: This chapter explores the function-
ality of printers and scanners. You will learn how to maintain, install, and repair these
devices in both local and network configurations. The chapter discusses safety hazards,
configuration procedures, preventive maintenance, and printer and scanner sharing.
xxxiv

CompTIA A+ and EUCIP. This course is only an introduction to the world of IT. A techni-
cian may continue to study and earn the following certifications:
■CCNA (Cisco Certified Networking Associate)
■CCNP (Cisco Certified Networking Professional)
■CCIE (Cisco Certified Internetworking Expert)
■CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)
■MCP (Microsoft Certified Professional)
■MCSA (Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator)
■MCSE (Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer)
■Network+ (CompTIA Network Certification)
■Linux+ (CompTIA Linux Certification)
IT certifications can be used as credits for university and college degrees in areas such as
computer science and telecommunications.
Describe the A+ Certification
CompTIA developed the A+ Certification program. A CompTIA A+ certification signifies
that a candidate is a qualified PC hardware and software technician. CompTIA certifications
are known throughout the IT community as one of the best ways to enter the information
technology field and build a solid career.
An A+ Certification candidate must pass two exams. All certification candidates must pass
the A+ Essentials exam (Exam 220-601). The Essentials exam covers the basic skills need-
ed to install, build, upgrade, repair, configure, troubleshoot, optimize, diagnose, and main-
tain basic PC hardware and operating systems.
The second advanced exam depends on the type of certification you want. Each advanced
exam assesses specialized skills in one of the following areas:
■IT Technician (Exam 220-602): Assesses field-service technicians who work in both
mobile and corporate technical environments.
■Remote Support Technician (Exam 220-603): Assesses remote-support technicians
who are responsible for assisting a customer without physically touching the cus-
tomer’s computer. A remote technician often works in a call-center environment, where
technicians resolve operating system and connectivity issues over the telephone or
4

Internet. A remote-support technician is also called a help-desk technician, a call-center
technician, a technical specialist, or a technical representative.
■Depot Technician (Exam 220-604): Assesses depot technicians, who have limited
interaction with the customer and work primarily in a workshop or lab. A depot techni-
cian is also called a bench technician.
Worksheet 1.1.2: Job Opportunities
In this activity, you use the Internet, magazines, or a local newspaper to gather information
on jobs in the computer service and repair field. Be prepared to discuss your research with
the class. Refer to the worksheet in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and
Study Guide, Third Edition. You may complete this worksheet now or wait to do so until the
end of the chapter. 
Describe the EUCIP Certification
The EUCIP IT Administrator program offers a recognized certification of competence in IT.
The certification covers the standards prescribed by the Council of European Professional
Informatics Societies (CEPIS). The EUCIP IT Administrator Certification consists of five
modules, as described in the following sections, with a corresponding exam for each mod-
ule. This course prepares you for Modules 1, 2, and 3.
Module 1: Computer Hardware
The Computer Hardware module requires that the candidate understand the basic makeup
of a PC and the functions of the components. The candidate should be able to effectively
diagnose and repair hardware problems. The candidate should be able to advise customers
of appropriate hardware to buy.
Module 2: Operating Systems
The Operating Systems module requires that the candidate be familiar with the procedures
for installing and updating most common operating systems and applications. The candidate
should know how to use system tools to troubleshoot and repair operating systems.
Module 3: Local-Area Network and Network Services
The Local-Area Network and Network Services module requires that the candidate be
familiar with the procedure of installing, using, and managing local-area networks (LAN).
The candidate should be able to add and remove users and shared resources. The candidate
should know how to use system tools to troubleshoot and repair networks.
Chapter 1: Introduction to the Personal Computer

Module 4: Expert Network Use
This module is beyond the scope of the IT Essentials course, although some of the topics
are covered. The Expert Network Use module requires that the candidate understand LAN
communication.
Module 5: IT Security
This module is beyond the scope of the IT Essentials course, although some of the topics
are covered. The IT Security module requires that the candidate be familiar with security
methods and features that are available for a standalone or networked computer. 
Describe a Computer System
A computer system consists of hardware and software components. Hardware is the physi-
cal equipment such as the case, storage drives, keyboards, monitors, cables, speakers, and
printers. The term software includes the operating system and programs. The operating sys-
tem instructs the computer how to operate. These operations may include identifying,
accessing, and processing information. Programs or applications perform different func-
tions. Programs vary widely, depending on the type of information that is accessed or gen-
erated. For example, instructions for balancing a checkbook are very different from instruc-
tions for simulating a virtual-reality world on the Internet.
The following sections discuss the hardware components found in a computer system.
Identify the Names, Purposes, and
Characteristics of Cases and Power Supplies
The computer case provides protection and support for the computer’s internal components.
All computers need a power supply to convert alternating-current (AC) power from the wall
socket into direct-current (DC) power. The size and shape of the computer case is usually
determined by the motherboard and other internal components.
You can select a large computer case to accommodate additional components that may be
required in the future. Other users may select a smaller case that requires minimal space. In
general, the computer case should be durable and easy to service and should have enough
room for expansion.
The power supply must provide enough power for the components that are currently
installed and allow for additional components that may be added later. If you choose a
power supply that powers only the current components, it may be necessary to replace the
power supply when other components are upgraded.

■Describe cases.
■Describe power supplies.
Describe Cases
A computer case contains the framework to support a computer’s internal components while
providing an enclosure for added protection. Computer cases typically are made of plastic,
steel, and aluminum and are available in a variety of styles.
The size and layout of a case is called a form factor. There are many types of cases, but the
basic form factors for computer cases include desktop and tower. Desktop cases may be
slimline or full-sized, and tower cases may be mini or full-sized, as shown in Figure 1-1.
Figure 1-1
Tower Cases
Chapter 1: Introduction to the Personal Computer
7
Computer cases are referred to in a number of ways:
■Computer chassis
■Cabinet
■Tower
■Box
■Housing
In addition to providing protection and support, cases also provide an environment designed
to keep the internal components cool. Case fans are used to move air through the computer

case. As the air passes warm components, it absorbs heat and then exits the case. This
process keeps the computer’s components from overheating.
You must consider many factors when choosing a case:
■The size of the motherboard
■The number of external or internal drive locations, called bays
■Available space
When choosing a computer case, consider the following:
■Model type: There are two main case models. One type is for desktop PCs, and the
other is for tower computers. The type of motherboard you choose determines the type
of case that can be used. The size and shape must match exactly.
■Size: If a computer has many components, it needs more room for airflow to keep the
system cool. 
■Available space: Desktop cases allow space conservation in tight areas, because the
monitor can be placed on top of the unit. The design of the desktop case may limit the
number and size of the components that can be added.
■Power supply: You must match the power rating and connection type of the power
supply to the type of motherboard you have chosen.
■Appearance: Some people don’t care how the case looks. Others do. You have many
case designs to choose from if you want an attractive case.
■Status display: What is going on inside the case can be very important. LED indica-
tors that are mounted on the front of the case can tell you if the system is receiving
power, when the hard drive is being used, and when the computer is on standby or
sleeping.
■Vents: All cases have a vent on the power supply, and some have another vent on the
back to help draw air into or out of the system. Some cases are designed with more
vents in the event that the system needs a way to dissipate an unusual amount of heat.
This situation may occur when many devices are installed close together in the case.
In addition to providing protection from the environment, cases help prevent damage from
static electricity. Internal components of the computer are grounded by attachment to the
case.
Note
You should select a case that matches the physical dimensions of the power supply and motherboard.

Describe Power Supplies
The power supply, shown in Figure 1-2, converts alternating-current (AC) power coming
from a wall outlet into direct-current (DC) power, which is a lower voltage. DC power is
required for all the components inside the computer.
Figure 1-2

Connectors
Most connectors today are keyed connectors. Keyed connectors are designed to be inserted
in only one direction. Each part of the connector has a colored wire with a different voltage
running through it, as described in Table 1-1.
Note
Different power supply form factors provide different power output connections, depending on sys-
tem requirements. AT form factors have been slowly phased out by ATX form factor power supplies
because of the different case sizes and advanced features. ATXv12 was created to add power support
for the motherboard by adding another four-pin power connector.

Different connectors are used to connect specific components and various locations on the
motherboard:
■A Molex connector is a keyed connector used to connect to an optical drive or hard
drive.
■A Berg connector is a keyed connector used to connect to a floppy drive. A Berg con-
nector is smaller than a Molex connector.
■A 20-pin or 24-pin slotted connector is used to connect to the motherboard. The 24-pin
slotted connector has two rows of 12 pins each, and the 20-pin slotted connector has
two rows of 10 pins each.
■A four-pin-to-eight-pin auxiliary power connector has two rows of two to four pins and
supplies power to all areas of the motherboard. The four-pin-to-eight-pin auxiliary
power connector is the same shape as the main power connector, but smaller.

■Older standard power supplies used two connectors called P8 and P9 to connect to the
motherboard. P8 and P9 were unkeyed connectors. They could be installed backwards,
potentially damaging the motherboard or power supply. The installation required that
the connectors were lined up with the black wires together in the middle.
Note
If you have a difficult time inserting a connector, try a different way, or check to make sure that no
bent pins or foreign objects are in the way. Remember, if it seems difficult to plug in any cable or
other part, something is wrong. Cables, connectors, and components are designed to fit together
snugly. Never force any connector or component. Connectors that are plugged in incorrectly will
damage the plug and the connector. Take your time, and make sure that you are handling the hard-
ware correctly. 
Electricity and Ohm’s Law
The four basic units of electricity are
■Voltage (V)
■Current (I)
■Power (P)
■Resistance (R)
Voltage, current, power, and resistance are electronics terms that a computer technician
must know:
■Voltage is a measure of the force required to push electrons through a circuit. Voltage
is measured in volts (V). A computer power supply usually produces several different
voltages.
■Current is a measure of the number of electrons going through a circuit. Current is
measured in amperes, or amps (A). Computer power supplies deliver different amper-
ages for each output voltage.
■Power is a measure of the pressure required to push electrons through a circuit, called
voltage, multiplied by the number of electrons going through that circuit, called cur-
rent. The measurement is called watts (W). Computer power supplies are rated in watts.
■Resistance is the opposition to the flow of current in a circuit. Resistance is measured
in ohms. Lower resistance allows more current, and therefore more power, to flow
through a circuit. A good fuse has low resistance or a measurement of almost 0 ohms.
Here’s a basic equation that expresses how voltage, current, and resistance relate to each
other:
V = IR
Chapter 1: Introduction to the Personal Computer
11

This equation, known as Ohm’s Law, states that voltage is equal to the current multiplied
by the resistance.
In an electrical system, power (P) is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current, as
expressed by the following equation:
P = VI
In an electrical circuit, increasing the current or voltage results in higher power.
As an example of how this works, imagine a simple circuit that has a 9-V light bulb hooked
up to a 9-V battery. The power output of the light bulb is 100 W. Using the equation to cal-
culate power, you can calculate how much current in amps would be required to get 100 W
out of this 9-V bulb.
To solve this equation, you use the following information that you know:
P = 100 W
V = 9 V
So:
I = 100 W / 9 V = 11.11 A
What happens if a 12-V battery and a 12-V light bulb are used to get 100 W of power?
100 W / 12 V = 8.33 amps
This system produces the same power, but with less current.
Computers normally use power supplies ranging from 200 W to 500 W. However, some
computers may need 500-W to 800-W power supplies. When building a computer, select a
power supply with sufficient wattage to power all the components. Obtain the wattage infor-
mation for the components from the manufacturer’s documentation. When deciding on a
power supply, be sure to choose a power supply that has more than enough power for the
current components.
Caution
Do not open a power supply. Electronic capacitors located inside a power supply can hold a charge
for extended periods of time. 
Identify the Names, Purposes, and
Characteristics of Internal Components
This section discusses the names, purposes, and characteristics of a computer’s internal
components, as shown in Figure 1-3.

Identify the Names, Purposes, and Characteristics of
Motherboards
The motherboard is the main printed circuit board. It contains the buses, or electrical
pathways, found in a computer. These buses allow data to travel between the various
components that comprise a computer. A motherboard is also known as the system board,
backplane, or main board. Figure 1-4 shows a variety of motherboards.
The motherboard accommodates the central processing unit (CPU), RAM, expansion slots,
heat sink/fan assembly, BIOS chip, chip set, and the embedded wires that interconnect the
motherboard components. Sockets, internal and external connectors, and various ports are
also placed on the motherboard.

Figure 1-4
Motherboards
14
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
The form factor of motherboards pertains to the board’s size and shape. It also describes the
physical layout of the different components and devices on the motherboard. Motherboards
have various form factors:
■Advanced Technology (AT)
■Advanced Technology Extended (ATX)
■Smaller footprint than Advanced Technology Extended (Mini-ATX)
■Smaller footprint than Advanced Technology Extended (Micro-ATX)
■Low-Profile Extended (LPX)
■New Low-Profile Extended (NLX)
■Balanced technology Extended (BTX)
An important set of components on the motherboard is the chip set. The chip set is com-
posed of various integrated circuits attached to the motherboard that control how system
hardware interacts with the CPU and motherboard. The CPU is installed into a slot or sock-
et on the motherboard. The socket on the motherboard determines the type of CPU that can
be installed.
The chip set of a motherboard allows the CPU to communicate and interact with the com-
puter’s other components and to exchange data with system memory (RAM), hard-disk
drives, video cards, and other output devices. The chip set establishes how much memory
can be added to a motherboard. The chip set also determines the type of connectors on the
motherboard.
Most chip sets are divided into two distinct components, northbridge and southbridge. What
each component does varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, but in general the north-

bridge controls access to the RAM, video card, and the speeds at which the CPU can com-
municate with them. The video card is sometimes integrated into the northbridge. The
southbridge, in most cases, allows the CPU to communicate with the hard drives, sound
card, USB ports, and other input/output (I/O) ports. 
Identify the Names, Purposes, and Characteristics of
CPUs
The central processing unit (CPU) is considered the computer’s brain. It is sometimes
called the processor. Most calculations take place in the CPU. In terms of computing power,
the CPU is the most important element of a computer system. CPUs come in different form
factors, each style requiring a particular slot or socket on the motherboard. Common CPU
manufacturers include Intel and AMD.
The CPU socket or slot is the connector that is the interface between the motherboard and
the processor. Most CPU sockets and processors in use today are built around the pin grid
array (PGA) architecture, in which the pins on the underside of the processor are inserted
into the socket, usually with zero insertion force (ZIF). ZIF refers to the amount of force
needed to install a CPU into the motherboard socket or slot. Slot-based processors are car-
tridge-shaped and fit into a slot that looks similar to an expansion slot. Tables 1-2 through
1-8 list common CPU socket specifications.

The CPU executes a program, which is a sequence of stored instructions. Each model of
processor has an instruction set, which it executes. The CPU executes the program by pro-
cessing each piece of data as directed by the program and the instruction set. While the
CPU is executing one step of the program, the remaining instructions and the data are
stored nearby in a special memory called cache. Two major CPU architectures are related to
instruction sets:
■Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC): Architectures use a relatively small set of
instructions, and RISC chips are designed to execute these instructions very rapidly.
■Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC): Architectures use a broad set of instruc-
tions, resulting in fewer steps per operation.
Some CPUs incorporate hyperthreading to enhance the CPU’s performance. With hyper-
threading, the CPU has multiple pieces of code being executed simultaneously on each
pipeline. To an operating system, a single CPU with hyperthreading appears to be two
CPUs.
A CPU’s power is measured by its speed and the amount of data it can process. A CPU’s
speed is rated in cycles per second. The speed of current CPUs is measured in millions of
cycles per second, called megahertz (MHz), or billions of cycles per second, called giga-
hertz (GHz). The amount of data that a CPU can process at the one time depends on the
size of the processor data bus. This is also called the CPU bus or the front-side bus (FSB).
The wider the processor data bus, the more powerful the processor. Current processors have
a 32-bit or 64-bit processor data bus.
Overclocking is a technique used to make a processor work at a faster speed than its origi-
nal specification. Overclocking is an unreliable way to improve computer performance and
can damage the CPU.
MMX is a set of multimedia instructions built into Intel processors. MMX-enabled micro-
processors can handle many common multimedia operations that normally are handled by a
separate sound or video card. However, only software specially written to call MMX
instructions can take advantage of the MMX instruction set.
The latest processor technology has caused CPU manufacturers to find ways to incorporate
more than one CPU core into a single chip. Many CPUs can process multiple instructions
concurrently:

■Single-core CPU: One core inside a single CPU chip that handles all the processing
capability. A motherboard manufacturer may provide sockets for more than a single
processor, providing the ability to build a powerful multiprocessor computer.
■Dual-core CPU: Two cores inside a single CPU chip, in which both cores can process
information at the same time.
Identify the Names, Purposes, and Characteristics of
Cooling Systems
Electronic components generate heat. Heat is caused by the flow of current within the com-
ponents. Computer components perform better when kept cool. If the heat is not removed,
the computer may run slower. If too much heat builds up, computer components can be
damaged.
Increasing the air flow in the computer case allows more heat to be removed. A case fan,
shown in Figure 1-5, is installed in the computer case to make the cooling process more
efficient.
Figure 1-5
Case Fan
18
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
In addition to case fans, a heat sink draws heat away from the core of the CPU. A fan on
top of the heat sink moves the heat away from the CPU, as shown in Figure 1-6.
Other components are also susceptible to heat damage and sometimes are equipped with
fans. Video adapter cards produce a great deal of heat. Fans are dedicated to cooling the
graphics-processing unit (GPU), as shown in Figure 1-7.

Figure 1-6
CPU Fans
Chapter 1: Introduction to the Personal Computer
19
Figure 1-7
Graphics Card Cooling System
Computers with extremely fast CPUs and GPUs may use a water-cooling system. A metal
plate is placed over the processor, and water is pumped over the top to collect the heat that
the CPU creates. The water is pumped to a radiator to be cooled by the air and then is recir-
culated. 
Identify the Names, Purposes, and Characteristics of
ROM and RAM
ROM and RAM provide memory for a vast amount of computer equipment. They come in
different memory sizes and module sizes and have different features. The following sections
cover ROM and RAM in greater detail.

ROM
Read-only memory (ROM) chips are located on the motherboard. ROM chips contain
instructions that the CPU can access directly. ROM stores basic instructions for booting the
computer and loading the operating system. ROM chips retain their contents even when the
computer is powered down. The contents cannot be erased, changed, or rewritten by normal
means. ROM types include the following:
■Programmable read-only memory (PROM): Information is written to a PROM chip
after it is manufactured. A PROM chip cannot be erased or rewritten.
■Erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM): Information is written to an
EPROM chip after it is manufactured. An EPROM chip can be erased with exposure to
UV light. Special equipment is required.
■Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM): Information is
written to an EEPROM chip after it is manufactured. EEPROM chips are also called
flash ROMs. An EEPROM chip can be erased and rewritten without removing the chip
from the computer.
Note
ROM is sometimes called firmware. This is misleading, because firmware is actually the software
that is stored in a ROM chip.
RAM
Random-access memory (RAM) is the temporary storage for data and programs that are
being accessed by the CPU. RAM is volatile memory, which means that the contents are
erased when the computer is powered off. The more RAM in a computer, the more capacity
the computer has to hold and process large programs and files, as well as enhance system
performance. The different types of RAM are as follows:
■Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is a memory chip that is used as main memory. DRAM must
be constantly refreshed with pulses of electricity to maintain the data stored in the chip.
■Static RAM (SRAM) is a memory chip that is used as cache memory. SRAM is much
faster than DRAM and does not have to be refreshed as often.
■Fast Page Mode (FPM) DRAM is memory that supports paging. Paging enables faster
access to the data than regular DRAM. Most 486 and Pentium systems from 1995 and
earlier use FPM memory.
■Extended Data Out (EDO) RAM is memory that overlaps consecutive data accesses.
This speeds up the access time to retrieve data from memory, because the CPU does
not have to wait for one data access cycle to end before another data access cycle
begins.
20
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) is DRAM that operates in synchronization with the
memory bus. The memory bus is the data path between the CPU and the main memory.
■Double Data Rate (DDR) SDRAM is memory that transfers data twice as fast as
SDRAM. DDR SDRAM increases performance by transferring data twice per cycle.
■Double Data Rate 2 (DDR2) SDRAM is faster than DDR-SDRAM memory. DDR2
SDRAM improves performance over DDR SDRAM by decreasing noise and crosstalk
between the signal wires.
■RAMBus DRAM (RDRAM) is a memory chip that was developed to communicate at
very high rates of speed. RDRAM chips are not commonly used.
Memory Modules
Early computers had RAM installed on the motherboard as individual chips. These individ-
ual memory chips, called dual inline package (DIP) chips, were difficult to install and often
became loose on the motherboard. To solve this problem, designers soldered the memory
chips on a special circuit board called a memory module. The different types of memory
modules are as follows:
■Dual Inline Package (DIP) is an individual memory chip. A DIP had dual rows of
pins used to attach it to the motherboard.
■Single Inline Memory Module (SIMM) is a small circuit board that holds several
memory chips. SIMMs have 30-pin and 72-pin configurations.
■Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM) is a circuit board that holds SDRAM, DDR
SDRAM, and DDR2 SDRAM chips. There are 168-pin SDRAM DIMMs, 184-pin
DDR DIMMs, and 240-pin DDR2 DIMMs.
■RAM Bus Inline Memory Module (RIMM) is a circuit board that holds RDRAM
chips. A typical RIMM has a 184-pin configuration.
Note
Memory modules can be single-sided or double-sided. Single-sided memory modules contain RAM
on only one side of the module. Double-sided memory modules contain RAM on both sides of the
module.
Cache Memory
SRAM is used as cache memory to store the most frequently used data. SRAM gives the
processor faster access to the data than retrieving it from the slower DRAM, or main mem-
ory. The three types of cache memory are as follows:
■L1 is internal cache integrated into the CPU.
Chapter 1: Introduction to the Personal Computer
21

■L2 is external cache originally mounted on the motherboard near the CPU. L2 cache is
now integrated into the CPU.
■L3 is used on some high-end workstations and server CPUs.
Error Checking
Memory errors occur when the data is stored incorrectly in the RAM chips. The computer
uses different methods to detect and correct data errors in memory. Three different methods
of memory error checking are as follows:
■Nonparity does not check for errors in memory.
■Parity contains 8 bits for data and 1 bit for error checking. The error-checking bit is
called a parity bit.
■Error Correction Code (ECC) can detect multiple bit errors in memory and correct
single bit errors in memory.
Identify the Names, Purposes, and Characteristics of
Adapter Cards
Adapter cards increase a computer’s functionality by adding controllers for specific devices
or by replacing malfunctioning ports. Figure 1-8 shows several types of adapter cards.
Figure 1-8
Adapter Cards
22
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Adapter cards are used to expand and customize the computer’s capability:
■NIC connects a computer to a network using a network cable.
■Wireless NIC connects a computer to a network using radio frequencies.

■Sound adapter provides audio capability.
■Video adapter provides graphic capability.
■Modem adapter connects a computer to the Internet using a phone line.
■SCSI adapter connects SCSI devices, such as hard drives or tape drives, to a
computer.
■RAID adapter connects multiple hard drives to a computer to provide redundancy and
to improve performance.
■USB port connects a computer to peripheral devices.
■Parallel port connects a computer to peripheral devices.
■Serial port connects a computer to peripheral devices.
Computers have expansion slots on the motherboard to install adapter cards. The type of
adapter card connector must match the expansion slot. A riser card is used in computer sys-
tems with the LPX form factor to allow adapter cards to be installed horizontally. The riser
card is mainly used in slimline desktop computers. The different types of expansion slots
are as follows:
■Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) is an 8-bit or 16-bit expansion slot. This is older
technology and is seldom used.
■Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) is a 32-bit expansion slot. This is
older technology and is seldom used.
■Microchannel Architecture (MCA) is an IBM-proprietary 32-bit expansion slot. This
is older technology and is seldom used.
■Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) is a 32-bit or 64-bit expansion slot. PCI is
the standard slot currently used in most computers.
■Advanced Graphics Port (AGP) is a 32-bit expansion slot. AGP is designed for video
adapters.
■PCI-Express is a serial bus expansion slot. PCI-Express is backward-compatible with
PCI slots. PCI-Express has x1, x4, x8, x16 slots. 
Identify the Names, Purposes, and Characteristics of
Storage Drives
A storage drive reads or writes information to magnetic or optical storage media. It can be
used to store data permanently or to retrieve information from a media disk. Storage drives
can be installed inside the computer case, such as a hard drive. For portability, some storage
drives can connect to the computer using a USB port, a FireWire port, or a SCSI port.
Chapter 1: Introduction to the Personal Computer
23

These portable storage drives are sometimes called removable drives and can be used on
multiple computers. Figure 1-9 shows some common types of storage drives:
■Floppy drive
■Hard drive
■Optical drive
■Flash drive
■Network drive (not shown in Figure 1-9)
Figure 1-9
Storage Drives
24
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
The following sections describe these storage drives in greater detail.
Floppy Drives
A floppy drive, or floppy disk drive, is a storage device that uses removable 3.5-inch floppy
disks. These magnetic floppy disks can store 720 KB or 1.44 MB of data. In a computer,
the floppy drive is usually configured as the A: drive. The floppy drive can be used to boot
the computer if it contains a bootable floppy disk. A 5.25-inch floppy drive is older technol-
ogy and is seldom used.
The floppy drive is slowly being replaced by cheaper, faster, and larger-capacity storage
such as writable CDs, DVDs, and flash drive media.
Hard Drives
A hard drive, or hard-disk drive, is a magnetic storage device that is installed inside the
computer. The hard drive is used as permanent storage for data. In a computer, the hard
drive is usually configured as the C: drive and contains the operating system and applica-
tions. The hard drive is usually configured as the first drive in the boot sequence. The

storage capacity of a hard drive is measured in billions of bytes, or gigabytes (GB). The
speed of a hard drive is measured in revolutions per minute (rpm). Multiple hard drives can
be added to increase storage capacity.
Optical Drives
An optical drive is a storage device that uses lasers to read data on the optical media. Two
types of optical drives exist:
■Compact disc (CD)
■Digital versatile disc (DVD)
CD and DVD media can be prerecorded (read-only), recordable (write once), or rerecord-
able (read and write multiple times). CDs have a data storage capacity of approximately
700 MB. DVDs have a data storage capacity of approximately 8.5 GB on one side of the
disc. 
Several types of optical media exist:
■CD-ROM is CD read-only memory media that is prerecorded.
■CD-R is CD recordable media that can be recorded once.
■CD-RW is CD rewritable media that can be recorded, erased, and rerecorded.
■DVD-ROM is DVD read-only memory media that is prerecorded.
■DVD-RAM is DVD random-access memory media that can be recorded, erased, and
rerecorded.
■DVD+/-R is DVD recordable media that can be recorded once.
■DVD+/-RW is DVD rewritable media that can be recorded, erased, and rerecorded.
Flash Drives
A flash drive, also known as a thumb drive, is a removable storage device that connects to a
USB port. A flash drive uses a special type of memory that requires no power to maintain
the data. These drives can be accessed by the operating system in the same way other types
of drives are accessed.
The storage capacity of a flash drive varies from a couple of megabytes to 16 gigabytes. 
Network Drives
A network drive is a connection to a remote computer’s storage for access to files, directo-
ries, and applications. Network connections are covered in more detail in later chapters.
Chapter 1: Introduction to the Personal Computer
25

Types of Drive Interfaces
Hard drives and optical drives are manufactured with different interfaces that are used to
connect the drive to the computer. When you install a storage drive in a computer, the con-
nection interface on the drive must be the same as the controller on the motherboard. Some
common drive interfaces are as follows:
■Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE), also called Advanced Technology Attachment
(ATA), is an early drive controller interface that connects computers and hard-disk
drives. An IDE interface uses a 40-pin connector.
■Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE), also called ATA-2, is an updated ver-
sion of the IDE drive controller interface. EIDE supports hard drives larger than 512
MB, enables Direct Memory Access (DMA) for speed, and uses the AT Attachment
Packet Interface (ATAPI) to accommodate optical drives and tape drives on the EIDE
bus. An EIDE interface uses a 40-pin connector.
■Parallel ATA (PATA) refers to the parallel version of the ATA drive controller interface.
■Serial ATA (SATA) refers to the serial version of the ATA drive controller interface. A
SATA interface uses a seven-pin connector.
■Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is a drive controller interface that can con-
nect up to 15 drives. SCSI can connect both internal and external drives. A SCSI inter-
face uses a 50-pin, 68-pin, or 80-pin connector.
Identify the Names, Purposes, and Characteristics of
Internal Cables
Drives require both a power cable and a data cable. A power supply has a SATA power con-
nector for SATA drives, a Molex power connector for PATA drives, and a Berg four-pin
connector for floppy drives. The buttons and the LED lights on the front of the case connect
to the motherboard with the front panel cables. Figure 1-10 shows some examples of inter-
nal PC cables. 
Data cables connect drives to the drive controller, which is located on an adapter card or the
motherboard. Some common types of data cables are as follows:
■Floppy disk drive (FDD) data cable has up to two 34-pin drive connectors and one 34-
pin connector for the drive controller.
■PATA (IDE) data cable has 40 conductors, up to two 40-pin connectors for drives, and
one 40-pin connector for the drive controller.
■PATA (EIDE) data cable has 80 conductors, up to two 40-pin connectors for drives, and
one 40-pin connector for the drive controller.
■SATA data cable has seven conductors, one keyed connector for the drive, and one
keyed connector the drive controller.
26
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■SCSI data cable: Three types of SCSI data cables exist:
■A narrow SCSI data cable has 50 conductors, up to seven 50-pin connectors for
drives, and one 50-pin connector for the drive controller, also called the host
adapter.
■A wide SCSI data cable has 68 conductors, up to 15 68-pin connectors for drives,
and one 68-pin connector for the host adapter.
■An Alt-4 SCSI data cable has 80 conductors, up to 15 80-pin connectors for drives,
and one 80-pin connector for the host adapter.

Note
A colored stripe on a cable identifies Pin 1 on the cable. When installing a data cable, always ensure
that Pin 1 on the cable aligns with Pin 1 on the drive or drive controller. Some cables may be keyed;
therefore, they can be connected only one way to the drive and drive controller.

Identify the Names, Purposes, and
Characteristics of Ports and Cables
I/O ports on a computer connect peripheral devices, such as printers, scanners, and portable
drives. The following ports and cables are commonly used:
■Serial
■USB
■FireWire
■Parallel
■SCSI
■Network
■PS/2
■Audio
■Video
The following sections explain port and cable topics in greater detail.
Serial Ports and Cables
A serial port can be either a DB-9, as shown in Figure 1-11, or a DB-25 male connector.
Serial ports transmit 1 bit of data at a time. To connect a serial device, such as a modem or
printer, a serial cable must be used. A serial cable has a maximum length of 50 feet (15.2 m).
Figure 1-11
Serial Ports and Cables
28
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

USB Ports and Cables
The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a standard interface that connects peripheral devices to a
computer. It was originally designed to replace serial and parallel connections. USB devices
are hot-swappable, which means that users can connect and disconnect the devices while
the computer is powered on. USB connections can be found on computers, cameras, print-
ers, scanners, storage devices, and many other electronic devices. A USB hub is used to
connect multiple USB devices. A single USB port in a computer can support up to 127 sep-
arate devices with the use of multiple USB hubs. Some devices can also be powered
through the USB port, eliminating the need for an external power source. Figure 1-12
shows USB cables with connectors.
Figure 1-12
USB Connectors
Chapter 1: Introduction to the Personal Computer
29
USB 1.1 allowed transmission rates of up to 12 Mbps in full-speed mode and 1.5 Mbps in
low-speed mode. USB 2.0 allows transmission speeds up to 480 Mbps. USB devices can
only transfer data up to the maximum speed allowed by the specific port. 
FireWire Ports and Cables
FireWire is a high-speed, hot-swappable interface that connects peripheral devices to a
computer. A single FireWire port in a computer can support up to 63 devices. Some devices
can also be powered through the FireWire port, eliminating the need for an external power
source. FireWire uses the IEEE 1394 standard and is also known as i.Link.
The IEEE 1394a standard supports data rates up to 400 Mbps and cable lengths up to 15
feet (4.5 m). This standard uses a six-pin connector or a four-pin connector. The IEEE
1394b standard supports data rates in excess of 800 Mbps and uses a nine-pin connector.
Figure 1-13 shows FireWire cables with connectors.

Parallel Ports and Cables
A parallel port on a computer is a standard Type A DB-25 female connector. The parallel
connector on a printer is a standard Type B 36-pin Centronics connector. Some newer print-
ers may use a Type C high-density 36-pin connector. Parallel ports can transmit 8 bits of
data at a time and use the IEEE 1284 standard. To connect a parallel device, such as a print-
er, a parallel cable must be used. A parallel cable, as shown in Figure 1-14, has a maximum
length of 15 feet (4.5 m).
Figure 1-14
Parallel Cable

SCSI Ports and Cables
A SCSI port can transmit data at rates in excess of 320 Mbps and can support up to 15
devices. If a single SCSI device is connected to a SCSI port, the cable can be up to 80 feet
(24.4 m) in length. If multiple SCSI devices are connected to a SCSI port, the cable can be
up to 40 (12.2 m) feet in length. A SCSI port on a computer can be one of three different
types, as shown in Figure 1-15:
■DB-25 female connector
■High-density 50-pin female connector
■High-density 68-pin female connector
Figure 1-15
SCSI Connectors
Chapter 1: Introduction to the Personal Computer
31
Note
SCSI devices must be terminated at the endpoints of the SCSI chain. Check the device manual for
termination procedures.
Caution
Some SCSI connectors resemble parallel connectors. Be careful not to connect the cable to the wrong
port. The voltage used in the SCSI format may damage the parallel interface. SCSI connectors should
be clearly labeled.
Network Ports and Cables
A network port, also called an RJ-45 port, connects a computer to a network. The connec-
tion speed depends on the type of network port. Standard Ethernet can transmit up to 10
Mbps, Fast Ethernet can transmit up to 100 Mbps, and Gigabit Ethernet can transmit up to

1000 Mbps. The maximum length of network cable is 328 feet (100 m). Figure 1-16 shows
a network connector.
Figure 1-16

PS/2 Ports
A PS/2 port connects a keyboard or mouse to a computer. The PS/2 port is a six-pin mini-
DIN female connector. The connectors for the keyboard and mouse are often colored differ-
ently, as shown in Figure 1-17. If the ports are not color-coded, look for a small figure of a
mouse or keyboard next to each port.
Figure 1-17
PS/2 Ports

Audio Ports
An audio port connects audio devices to the computer. The following audio ports are com-
monly used, as shown in Figure 1-18:
■Line In connects to an external source, such as a stereo system.
■Microphone In connects to a microphone.
■Line Out connects to speakers or headphones.
■Auxiliary In is an additional line in.
■Gameport/MIDI connects to a joystick or MIDI-interfaced device.

Video Ports and Connectors
A video port connects a monitor cable to a computer. Several video port and connector
types exist:
■Video Graphics Array (VGA) has a three-row 15-pin female connector and provides
analog output to a monitor.
■Digital Visual Interface (DVI) has a 24-pin female connector or a 29-pin female con-
nector and provides compressed digital output to a monitor. DVI-I provides both analog
and digital signals. DVI-D provides digital signals only.
■High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) has a 19-pin connector and provides
digital video and digital audio signals.

■S-Video has a four-pin connector and provides analog video signals.
■Component/RGB has three shielded cables (red, green, and blue) with RCA jacks and
provides analog video signals.

Identify the Names, Purposes, and
Characteristics of Input Devices
An input device is used to enter data or instructions into a computer. Here are some exam-
ples of input devices:
■Mouse and keyboard
■Digital camera and digital video camera
■Biometric authentication device
■Touch screen
■Scanner
The mouse and keyboard are the two most commonly used input devices. The mouse is
used to navigate the graphical user interface (GUI). The keyboard is used to enter text com-
mands that control the computer.
Digital cameras and digital video cameras, shown in Figure 1-20, create images that can be
stored on magnetic media. The image is stored as a file that can be displayed, printed, or
altered.

Figure 1-20

Biometric identification uses features that are unique to an individual user, such as finger-
prints, voice recognition, or a retinal scan. When combined with ordinary usernames, bio-
metrics guarantees that the authorized person is accessing the data. Figure 1-21 shows a lap-
top that has a built-in fingerprint scanner.
Figure 1-21
Fingerprint Scanner
A touch screen has a pressure-sensitive transparent panel. The computer receives instruc-
tions specific to the place on the screen that the user touches.
A scanner digitizes an image or document. The digitization of the image is stored as a file
that can be displayed, printed, or altered. A bar code reader is a type of scanner that reads

Universal Product Code (UPC) bar codes. It is widely used for pricing and inventory infor-
mation. 
Identify the Names, Purposes, and
Characteristics of Output Devices
An output device is used to present information to the user from a computer. Here are some
examples of output devices:
■Monitors and projectors
■Printers, scanners, and fax machines
■Speakers and headphones
Monitors and Projectors
Monitors and projectors are primary output devices for a computer. Figure 1-22 shows dif-
ferent types of monitors.
Figure 1-22
Types of Monitors
36
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
CRT
LCD
DLP Projector
The most important difference between these monitor types is the technology used to create
an image:
■CRT: Cathode ray tube monitors are the most common monitor type. Red, green, and
blue electron beams move back and forth across the phosphorous-coated screen. The
phosphor glows when struck by the electron beam. Areas not struck by the electron
beam do not glow. The combination of glowing and nonglowing areas is what creates
the image on the screen. Most televisions also use this technology.

■LCD: Liquid crystal display is commonly used in laptops and some projectors. It con-
sists of two polarizing filters with a liquid crystal solution between them. An electronic
current aligns the crystals so that light can either pass through or not pass through. The
effect of light passing through in certain areas and not in others is what creates the
image. LCD comes in two forms—active matrix and passive matrix. Active matrix is
sometimes called thin film transistor (TFT). TFT allows each pixel to be controlled,
which creates very sharp color images. Passive matrix is less expensive than active
matrix but does not provide the same level of image control. LCD Monitors are becom-
ing the most common type of computer monitor.
■DLP: Digital light processing is another technology that is used in projectors. DLP pro-
jectors use a spinning color wheel with a microprocessor-controlled array of mirrors
called a digital micromirror device (DMD). Each mirror corresponds to a specific pixel.
Each mirror reflects light toward or away from the projector optics. This creates a
monochromatic image of up to 1024 shades of gray between white and black. The
color wheel then adds the color data to complete the projected color image.
Monitor resolution refers to the level of image detail that can be reproduced. Table 1-9 is a
chart of common monitor resolutions.

Higher-resolution settings produce better image quality. Several factors are involved in
monitor resolution:
■Pixels: The term pixel is an abbreviation of picture element. Pixels are the tiny dots
that comprise a screen. Each pixel consists of red, green, and blue.
■Dot pitch: Dot pitch is the distance between pixels on the screen. A lower dot pitch
number produces a better image.
■Refresh rate: The refresh rate is how often per second the image is rebuilt. A higher
refresh rate produces a better image and reduces the level of flicker.
■Interlaced/noninterlaced: Interlaced monitors create the image by scanning the screen
two times. The first scan covers the odd lines, top to bottom, and the second scan cov-
ers the even lines. Noninterlaced monitors create the image by scanning the screen one
line at a time from top to bottom. Most CRT monitors today are noninterlaced.
■Horizontal Vertical Colors (HVC): The number of pixels in a line is the horizontal res-
olution. The number of lines in a screen is the vertical resolution. The number of colors
that can be reproduced is the color resolution.
■Aspect ratio: Aspect ratio is the horizontal-to-vertical measurement of the monitor’s
viewing area. For example, a 4:3 aspect ratio applies to a viewing area that is 16 inches
wide by 12 inches high. A 4:3 aspect ratio also applies to a viewing area that is 24
inches wide by 18 inches high. A viewing area that is 22 inches wide by 12 inches high
has an aspect ratio of 11:6.
Monitors have controls for adjusting the image quality. Here are some common monitor set-
tings:
■Brightness is the image’s intensity.
■Contrast is the ratio of light to dark.
■Position is the vertical and horizontal location of the image on the screen.
■Reset returns the monitor settings to the factory defaults.
Printers, Scanners, and Fax Machines
Printers are output devices that create hard copies of computer files. Some printers special-
ize in particular applications, such as printing color photographs. Other all-in-one-type
printers, such as the one shown in Figure 1-23, are designed to provide multiple services
such as printing, fax, and copier functions.

Explain System Resources and Their Purposes
System resources are used for communication between the CPU and other components in a
computer. The three common system resources are
■Interrupt requests (IRQ)
■I/O port addresses
■Direct Memory Access (DMA)
The following sections describe these system resources in greater detail.
Interrupt Requests
Computer components use interrupt requests (IRQ) to request information from the CPU.
The IRQ travels along a wire on the motherboard to the CPU. When the CPU receives an
interrupt request, it determines how to fulfill this request. The priority of the request is
determined by the IRQ number assigned to that computer component. Older computers had
only eight IRQs to assign to devices. Newer computers have 16 IRQs, which are numbered
0 to 15, as shown in Table 1-10. As a general rule, each component in the computer must be
assigned a unique IRQ. IRQ conflicts can cause components to stop functioning and even
cause the computer to crash. With the numerous components that can be installed in a com-
puter, it is difficult to assign a unique IRQ to every component. Today, most IRQ numbers
are assigned automatically with “plug-and-play” operating systems and the implementation
of PCI slots, USB ports, and FireWire ports.

IRQ 14
Primary IDE. If no primary IDE exists, this can be changed.
IRQ 15
Secondary IDE. 
Input/Output (I/O) Port Addresses
Input/output (I/O) port addresses are used to communicate between devices and software.
The I/O port address is used to send and receive data for a component. As with IRQs, each
component has a unique I/O port assigned. A computer has 65,535 I/O ports, and they are
referenced by a hexadecimal address in the range of 0000h to FFFFh. Table 1-11 is a chart
of common I/O ports.

Direct Memory Access
High-speed devices use Direct Memory Access (DMA) channels to communicate directly
with the main memory. These channels allow the device to bypass interaction with the CPU

assigned a DMA channel, such as SCSI host adapters and sound cards. Older computers

This chapter covers basic safety practices for the workplace, hardware and software tools,
and the disposal of hazardous materials. Safety guidelines help protect individuals from
accidents and injury, equipment from damage, and the environment from contamination by
discarded materials. Always stay alert to situations that could result in injury or damage to
equipment. Always watch for these signs and take the appropriate action according to the
warning given.
Identify Safe Working Conditions and
Procedures
It is essential to maintain safe working conditions to prevent accidents and injury to any
person or damage to any object in a work area. New staff and visitors must be informed of
the appropriate safety procedures. Any transgression of the procedures must be reported.
As a computer user or a technician, you should be aware of all possible dangers. A safe
workspace is clean, organized, and well lit.
Follow proper procedures for handling computer equipment. Failure to follow the pre-
scribed safety procedures could result in fines, criminal convictions, damage to equipment,
claims for damage from the owner of the property and data, injury, or death.
The proper disposal or recycling of hazardous computer components is a global issue. Make
sure to follow regulations that govern how to dispose of specific items. When an organiza-
tion violates these regulations, there can be legal consequences.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Identify safety procedures and potential hazards for users and technicians
■Identify safety procedures to protect equipment from damage and data loss
■Identify correct disposal procedures to protect the environment from contamination
Identify Safety Procedures and Potential Hazards for
Users and Technicians
Safety in the lab and in the workplace is an important issue when working on computers
and other electrical devices. General safety guidelines and fire safety guidelines protect the
technician and the equipment.
Chapter 2: Safe Lab Procedures and Tool Use
3

General Safety Guidelines
Follow the basic safety guidelines to prevent cuts, burns, electrical shock, and damage to
eyesight. As a best practice, make sure that a fire extinguisher and first aid kit are available
in case of fire or injury. Here are some general safety guidelines:
■Remove your watch or any other jewelry and secure loose clothing.
■Turn off the power and unplug equipment before opening the case and performing
service.
■Cover any sharp edges inside the computer case with tape.
■Never open a power supply or a monitor.
■Do not touch areas in printers that are hot or use high voltage.
■Know where the fire extinguisher is located and how to use it.
■Know where the first aid kit is located.
■Keep food and drinks out of your workspace.
■Keep your workspace clean and free of clutter.
■Lift heavy objects with your legs to avoid back injury.
Caution
Power supplies and monitors contain very high voltage. Do not wear the antistatic wrist strap when
replacing power supplies or monitors. Also, some printer parts might become very hot when in use,
and other parts can contain very high voltages. Make sure that the printer has had time to cool before
making the repair. Check the printer manual for locations of various components that can contain
high voltages. Some components might retain high voltages even after the printer is turned off. 
Fire Safety Guidelines
Follow fire safety guidelines to protect equipment and lives. Turn off and unplug the com-
puter before beginning a repair to avoid damage to the computer or a shock to the techni-
cian.
Fire can spread rapidly and be very costly. Proper use of a fire extinguisher can prevent a
small fire from getting out of control. When working with computer components, always
consider the possibility of an accidental fire and know how to react. If there is a fire, you
should follow these safety procedures:
■Never fight a fire that is out of control or not contained.
■Always have a planned fire escape route before beginning any work.
■Get out of the building quickly.
■Contact emergency services for help.

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Caution
Be sure to read the instructions on the fire extinguishers in your workplace before you have to use
them. Safety training might be available in your organization.
In the United States, there are four classifications for fire extinguishers. A different letter,
color, and shape identify each fire extinguisher classification, as shown in Figure 2-1. Each
fire extinguisher has specific chemicals to fight each specific type of fire as follows:
■Class A: Effective for fires burning paper, wood, plastics, and cardboard materials
■Class B: Effective for fires burning gasoline, kerosene, or organic solvents
■Class C: Effective for fires burning electrical equipment
■Class D: Effective for fires burning combustible metals, such as magnesium and
titanium.
Figure 2-1
Fire Extinguisher Classifications
Chapter 2: Safe Lab Procedures and Tool Use

Fire extinguisher classifications might vary by country.
It is important to know how to use a fire extinguisher. Use the memory aid P-A-S-S to help
you remember the basic rules of fire extinguisher operation:
■P: Pull the pin.
■A: Aim at the base of the fire, not at the flames.
■S: Squeeze the lever.
■S: Sweep the nozzle from side to side.

Identify Safety Procedures to Protect Equipment from
Damage and Data from Loss
Static electricity is the buildup of an electric charge resting on a surface. This buildup and
sudden release of energy, called electrostatic discharge (ESD), can be destructive to the
electronics in a computer system.
ESD, harsh climates, and poor-quality sources of electricity can cause damage to computer
equipment. Follow the proper handling guidelines, be aware of environmental issues, and
use equipment that stabilizes power to prevent equipment damage and data loss.
At least 3000 volts of static electricity must be built up before you can feel the ESD, but
less than 30 volts of static electricity could damage a computer component. For example,
static electricity can build up on a person walking across a carpeted floor. When the person
touches another person, they both receive a shock. If the discharge causes pain or makes a
noise, the charge was probably above 10,000 volts.
ESD Protection Recommendations
ESD can cause permanent damage to electrical components. Follow these recommendations
to help prevent ESD damage:
■Keep all components in antistatic bags until you are ready to install them.
■Use grounded mats on workbenches and on the work area floor.
■Use antistatic wrist straps when working on computers.
■Avoid working on carpeted areas if possible.
Climate also affects risks when working with computer equipment. Consider the following
recommendations:
■If the environment temperature is too high, equipment can overheat.
■If the humidity level is too low, the chance of ESD increases.
■If the humidity level is too high, equipment can suffer from moisture damage.
Table 2-1 shows how environmental conditions affect the risks of ESD.

Power Fluctuation Types
Voltage is the force that moves electrons. The potential difference between two points in a
circuit is what causes electricity to move. The movement of electrons is called current.
Computer circuits need voltage and current to operate electronic components. When the
voltage in a computer is not accurate or steady, computer components might not operate
correctly. Unsteady voltages are called power fluctuations.
The following types of AC power fluctuations can cause data loss or hardware failure:
■Blackout: Loss of AC power. A blown fuse, damaged transformer, or downed power
line can cause a blackout.
■Brownout: Reduced voltage level of AC power that lasts for a period of time.
Brownouts occur when the power line voltage drops below 80 percent of the normal
voltage level. Overloading electrical circuits can cause a brownout.
■Noise: Interference from generators and lightning. Noise results in unclean power,
which can cause errors in a computer system.
■Spike: Sudden increase in voltage that lasts for a very short period and exceeds 100
percent of the normal voltage on a line. Spikes can be caused by lightning strikes, but
can also occur when the electrical system comes back on after a blackout.
■Power surge: Dramatic increase in voltage above the normal flow of electrical current.
A power surge lasts for a few nanoseconds, or a few billionths of a second. 
Power Protection Devices
To help shield against power issues, use power protection devices to protect the data and
computer equipment:
■Surge suppressor: Helps protect against damage from surges and spikes. A surge sup-
pressor diverts extra electrical voltage on the line to the ground.
■Uninterruptible power supply (UPS): Helps protect against potential electrical power
problems by supplying electrical power to a computer or other device. The battery is
constantly recharging while the UPS is connected to a power source. The UPS is able
to supply a consistent quality of power when brownouts and blackouts occur. Many
UPS devices are able to communicate directly with the operating system on a comput-
er. This allows the UPS to safely shut down the computer and save data prior to the
UPS losing all electrical power.
■Standby power supply (SPS): Helps protect against potential electrical power problems
by providing a backup battery to supply power when the incoming voltage drops below
the normal level. The battery is on standby during normal operation. When the voltage
decreases, the battery provides DC power to a power inverter, which converts it to AC
power for the computer. The problem with this device is the time it takes to switch over
Chapter 2: Safe Lab Procedures and Tool Use
7

to the battery. If the switching device fails, the battery will not be able to supply power
to the computer.
Figure 2-2 shows some examples of surge suppressors, UPSs, and SPS devices.
Figure 2-2
Surge Suppressors and UPS Devices

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Caution
Never plug a printer into a UPS device because this can overheat the printer motor. 
Identify Safety Procedures to Protect the
Environment from Contamination
Computers and peripherals can contain materials that are harmful to the environment.
Waste materials are listed as hazardous because they are known to be harmful and need to
be disposed of properly. Also called toxic waste, hazardous materials typically contain high
concentrations of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, or mercury. Always contact the
local recycling or waste removal authorities in your community for information about dis-
posal procedures and disposal services. 
Material Safety Data Sheet
A material safety data sheet (MSDS) is a fact sheet that summarizes information about
material identification, including hazardous ingredients that can affect personal health, fire
hazards, and first aid requirements. As Figure 2-3 shows, the MSDS contains chemical
reactivity and incompatibility information that includes spill, leak, and disposal procedures.
It also includes protective measures for the safe handling and storage of materials.

Figure 2-3
MSDS
Chapter 2: Safe Lab Procedures and Tool Use
9
To determine whether a material used in computer repairs or preventive maintenance is clas-
sified as hazardous, consult the manufacturer’s MSDS. In the United States, the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that all hazardous mate-
rials must be accompanied by an MSDS when transferred to a new owner. The MSDS
information included with products purchased for computer repairs or maintenance can be
relevant to computer technicians. OSHA also requires that employees be informed about the
materials that they are working with and be provided with material safety information. In
the United Kingdom, Chemicals Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply
Regulations 2002 (CHIP3) oversees the handling of hazardous materials. CHIP3 requires
chemical suppliers to safely package and transport dangerous chemicals and to include a
data sheet with the product.
The MSDS is valuable in determining how to dispose of any potentially hazardous materials
in the safest manner. Always check local regulations concerning acceptable disposal meth-
ods before disposing of any electronic equipment.
Note
If you are working outside the United States, make sure that you are familiar with the organization
that governs the use of hazardous chemicals and what that organization mandates regarding
compliance. 

The MSDS contains valuable information such as
■The name of the material
■The physical properties of the material
■Any hazardous ingredients contained in the material
■Reactivity data, such as fire and explosion data
■Procedures for spills or leaks
■Special precautions
■Health hazards
■Special protection requirements
Before discarding a computer or any of its components, it is necessary to consider safe dis-
posal of each separate component. 
Proper Disposal of Batteries
Batteries often contain rare-earth metals that can be harmful to the environment. Batteries
from portable computer systems can contain lead, cadmium, lithium, alkaline manganese,
and mercury. These metals do not decay and will remain in the environment for many years.
Mercury is commonly used in the manufacturing of batteries and is extremely toxic to
humans.
Recycling batteries should be a standard practice for a technician. All batteries, including
lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride, and lead-acid, are subject to disposal
procedures that comply with local environmental regulations.
Proper Disposal of Monitors or CRTs
Always handle monitors and cathode ray tubes (CRT) with care. Monitors and CRTs store a
potentially lethal voltage, even after being disconnected from a power source. CRTs contain
glass, metal, plastics, lead, barium, and rare-earth metals. According to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), CRTs can contain approximately 4 lb. (1.8 kg) of
lead. Monitors must be disposed of in compliance with environmental regulations.
Proper Disposal of Toner Kits, Cartridges, and Developers
Used printer toner kits and printer cartridges can be destructive to the environment and must
be disposed of properly or recycled. Some toner cartridge suppliers and manufacturers will
also take back empty cartridges for refilling. There are also companies that specialize in
refilling empty cartridges. Kits to refill inkjet printer cartridges are available, but are not
recommended. The ink can leak into the printer, causing irreversible damage. This can be
especially costly because using refilled inkjet cartridges can void the inkjet printer warranty.
10
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Proper Disposal of Chemical Solvents and Aerosol Cans
The chemicals and solvents used to clean computers can be a source of environmental prob-
lems when not disposed of properly. Contact the local sanitation company to learn how and
where to dispose of these chemicals. Never dump chemicals or solvents down a sink or dis-
pose of them in any drain that connects to public sewers.
The cans or bottles that solvents and other cleaning supplies come in must be handled care-
fully. Make sure that they are identified and treated as special hazardous waste. For exam-
ple, some aerosol cans can explode when exposed to heat if the contents are not completely
used.
Identify Tools and Software Used with Personal
Computer Components and Know Their
Purpose
For every tool there is the right job, and for every job there is the right tool. Ensure that you
are familiar with the correct use of each tool and that the right tool is used for the current
task. This will reduce the chances of damage or injury. Skilled use of tools and software
makes the job less difficult and ensures that tasks are performed properly and safely. Figure
2-4 shows a sample tool kit used to install, connect, remove, and repair PC components.
Figure 2-4
Computer Tools
Chapter 2: Safe Lab Procedures and Tool Use
11
In addition to hardware tools, software tools are also available that help diagnose problems
and determine which computer device is not functioning correctly.

A technician must document all repairs and computer problems. The documentation can
then be used as a reference for future problems or for other technicians who might not have
encountered the problem before. The documents might be paper based, but electronic forms
can be easily searched for specific problems.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Identify hardware tools and their purpose
■Identify software tools and their purpose
■Identify organizational tools and their purpose
Identify Hardware Tools and Their Purpose
A tool kit should contain all the tools necessary to complete hardware repairs. Using the
wrong tool for a job might lead to bodily injuries or result in equipment damage. As you
gain experience, you will learn which tools to have available for different types of jobs.
Hardware tools are grouped into the following four categories:
■ESD tools
■Hand tools
■Cleaning tools
■Diagnostic tools
ESD Tools
There are two common ESD tools:
■Antistatic wrist strap: Protects computer equipment from ESD damage when ground-
ed to a computer chassis.
■Antistatic mat: Used to stand on or to place hardware on to prevent static electricity
from building up, thereby protecting the equipment from ESD damage.
Hand Tools
Most tools used in the computer assembly process are small hand tools. They are available
individually or as part of a computer repair tool kit. The correct tools can save time and
help you avoid damaging the equipment. Tool kits range widely in size, quality, and price.
The list that follows describes the small hand tools that you will most commonly use:
■Flat head screwdriver: Used to loosen or tighten slotted screws.
■Phillips head screwdriver: Used to tighten or loosen cross-head screws.
■Torx screwdriver: Used to tighten or loosen screws that have a star-like depression on
the top, a feature that is mainly found on laptops.
12
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Hex driver: Sometimes called a nut driver, this tool is used to tighten nuts in the same
way that a screwdriver tightens screws.
■Needle-nose pliers: Used to hold small parts.
■Wire cutters: Used to strip and cut wires.
■Tweezers: Used to manipulate small parts.
■Part retriever: Used to retrieve parts from locations that are too small for your hand to
fit in.
■Flashlight: Used to illuminate areas that you cannot see well.
Cleaning Tools
The appropriate cleaning tools are essential when maintaining or repairing computers.
These tools will ensure that computer components are cleaned correctly. The list that fol-
lows describes the cleaning tools that you will most commonly use:
■Soft sloth: Used to clean different computer components without scratching or leaving
debris.
■Compressed air: Used to blow away dust and debris from different computer parts
without touching the components.
■Cable ties: Used to bundle cables neatly inside and outside of a computer.
■Parts organizer: Used to hold screws, jumpers, fasteners, and other small parts to pre-
vent them from getting mixed together.
Diagnostic Tools
To test hardware, you will use the following diagnostic tools:
■Digital multimeter: Used to test the integrity of circuits and the quality of electricity
in computer components.
■Loopback adapter: Used to test the basic functionality of computer ports.
Identify Software Tools and Their Purpose
A technician must be able to use a range of software tools to help diagnose problems, main-
tain hardware, and protect the data stored on a computer. The sections that follow describe
the various disk management tools and protection software tools that you will encounter.
Chapter 2: Safe Lab Procedures and Tool Use
13

Disk Management Tools
You must be able to identify which software to use in different situations. Disk manage-
ment tools help detect and correct disk errors, prepare a disk for data storage, and remove
unwanted files.
Disk management software includes the following:
■Fdisk: A command-line tool used to create and delete partitions on a hard drive and set
active, or boot, partitions
■Format: Used to prepare a hard drive to store information
■Scandisk or Chkdsk: Used to check the integrity of files and folders on a hard drive
by scanning the disk surface for physical errors
■Defrag: Used to optimize space on a hard drive to allow faster access to programs and
data
■Disk Cleanup: Used to clear space on a hard drive by searching for files that can be
safely deleted
■Disk Management: Used to manage hard drives and partitions, initialize disks, create
partitions, and format partitions
Use the Windows XP boot disk for troubleshooting and repairing corrupted files. The
Windows XP boot disk is designed to repair Windows system files, restore damaged or lost
files, and reinstall the operating system. Third-party software tools are available to assist in
troubleshooting problems. 
Protection Software Tools
Each year, viruses, spyware, and other types of malicious attacks infect millions of comput-
ers. These malicious attacks can damage an operating system, application, and data.
Computers that have been infected can experience hardware performance problems or com-
ponent failure.
To protect data and the integrity of the operating system and hardware, you should use soft-
ware designed to guard against attacks and to clean out malicious programs.
Here is a list of various types of software used to protect hardware and data. Examples of
protection software tools include the following:
■Windows XP Security Center: Allows you to check the status of essential security
settings on the computer. The Security Center continuously checks to make sure that
the software firewall and antivirus programs are running. It also ensures that automatic
updates are set to download and install automatically.
■Antivirus software: Protects a computer against virus attacks that can infect other
computers.
14
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Spyware remover: Protects against software that sends information about web surfing
habits to an attacker. Spyware can be installed without the knowledge or consent of the
user.
■Firewall: A program that runs continuously to protect against unauthorized communi-
cations to and from your computer.
Worksheet 2.2.2: Diagnostic Software
In this worksheet, you will use the Internet, a newspaper, or a local store to gather informa-
tion about a hard drive diagnostic program. Be prepared to discuss the diagnostic software
you researched. Refer to the worksheet in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs
and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can complete this worksheet
now or wait to do so until the end of the chapter. 
Identify Organizational Tools and Their Purpose
It is important that a technician document all services and repairs. These documents need to
be stored centrally and made available to all other technicians. The documentation can then
be used as reference material for similar problems that are encountered in the future. Good
customer service includes providing the customer with a detailed description of the problem
and the solution.
Personal Reference Tools
Personal reference tools include troubleshooting guides, manufacturers’ manuals, quick
reference guides, and a repair journal. In addition to an invoice, a technician keeps a journal
of upgrades and repairs. The documentation in the journal should include descriptions of
the problem, possible solutions that have been tried to correct the problem, and the steps
taken to repair the problem. Be sure to note any configuration changes made to the equip-
ment and any replacement parts used in the repair. This documentation will be valuable
when you encounter similar situations in the future:
■Notes: Make notes as you go through the investigation and repair process. These notes
will help you to make sure that you do not repeat any previous steps and will help you
to determine what steps to take next.
■Journal: Document the upgrades and repairs that you perform. The documentation
should include descriptions of the problem, possible solutions that have been tried to
correct the problem, and the steps taken to repair the problem. Be sure to note any con-
figuration changes made to the equipment and any replacement parts used in the repair.
Your journal, along with your notes, can be valuable when you encounter similar situa-
tions in the future.
Chapter 2: Safe Lab Procedures and Tool Use
15

■History of repairs: Make a detailed list of problems and repairs, including the date,
replacement parts, and customer information. The history allows a technician to deter-
mine what work has been performed on a computer in the past.
Note
It can be helpful to keep an electronic journal stored on a computer for later troubleshooting. 
Internet Reference Tools
The Internet is an excellent source of information about specific hardware problems and
possible solutions. Examples of Internet reference tools include the following:
■Internet search engines
■Newsgroups
■Manufacturer FAQs
■Online computer manuals
■Online forums and chat sessions
■Technical websites
Miscellaneous Tools
With experience, you will discover many additional items to add to the tool kit. Figure 2-5
shows how a roll of masking tape can be used to label parts that have been removed from a
computer.
Figure 2-5

16
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

A working computer is also a valuable resource to take with you on computer repairs in the
field. A working computer can be used to research information, download tools or drivers,
or communicate with other technicians.
Figure 2-6 shows the types of computer replacement parts to include in a tool kit. Make
sure that the parts are in good working order before you use them. Using known good
working components to replace possible bad ones in computers will help you quickly deter-
mine which component might not be working properly. You should store components in an
antistatic bag prior to installation, as shown in Figure 2-7.

Implement Proper Tool Use
Safety in the workplace is everyone’s responsibility. For computer repairs, always use the
correct tool for the job. The correct tool will make the job easier to complete. You are much
less likely to injure yourself or damage components when using the proper tool for the job.
Before cleaning or repairing equipment, check to make sure that your tools are in good con-
dition. Clean, repair, or replace any items that are not functioning adequately.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Demonstrate proper use of an antistatic wrist strap
■Demonstrate proper use of an antistatic mat
■Demonstrate proper use of various hand tools
■Demonstrate proper use of cleaning materials
Demonstrate Proper Use of an Antistatic Wrist Strap
As discussed previously, an example of ESD is the small shock that someone receives when
you walk across a carpeted room and touch a doorknob. Although the small shock is harm-

less to you, the same electrical charge passing from you to a computer can damage its com-
ponents. Wearing an antistatic wrist strap can prevent ESD damage to computer compo-
nents.
The purpose of an antistatic wrist strap is to equalize the electrical charge between you and
the equipment. The antistatic wrist strap is a conductor that connects your body to the
equipment that you are working on. When static electricity builds in your body, the connec-
tion made by the wrist strap to the equipment, or ground, channels the electricity through
the wire that connects the strap.
As shown in Figure 2-8, the wrist strap has two parts and is easy to wear:
1. Wrap the strap around your wrist and secure it using the snap or Velcro. The metal on
the back of the wrist strap must remain in contact with the skin at all times.
2. Snap the connector on the end of the wire to the wrist strap and connect the other end
either to the equipment or to the same grounding point that the antistatic mat is con-
nected to. The metal skeleton of the case is a good place to connect the wire. When
connecting the wire to equipment you are working on, choose an unpainted metal sur-
face. A painted surface does not conduct the electricity as well as unpainted metal.

Note
Attach the wire on the same side of the equipment as the arm that is wearing the antistatic wrist
strap. This will help to keep the wire out of the way while you are working.
Although wearing a wrist strap will help to prevent ESD, you can further reduce the risks
by not wearing clothing made of silk, polyester, or wool. These fabrics are more likely to
generate a static charge.

Note
Technicians should roll up their sleeves and tuck in their shirts to prevent interference from clothes.
Also, ensure that earrings, necklaces, and other loose jewelry are properly secured.
Caution
Never wear an antistatic wrist strap if you are repairing a monitor or CRT. 
Demonstrate Proper Use of an Antistatic Mat
You might not always have the option to work on a computer in a properly equipped work-
space. If you can control the environment, try to set up your workspace away from carpeted
areas. Carpets can cause the buildup of electrostatic charges. If you cannot avoid the carpet-
ing, take great care to ground yourself to the unpainted portion of the computer case that
you are working on before touching any components.
Antistatic Mat
An antistatic mat is slightly conductive. It works by drawing static electricity away from a
component and transferring it safely from equipment to a grounding point, as shown in
Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9
Antistatic Mat
20
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Lay the mat on the workspace next to or under the computer case. Clip the mat to the case
to provide a grounded surface on which you can place parts as you remove them from the
system. Reducing the potential for ESD reduces the likelihood of damage to delicate cir-
cuits or components.
Note
Always handle components by the edges.

Workbench
When you are working at a workbench, ground the workbench and the antistatic floor mat.
By standing on the mat and wearing the wrist strap, your body has the same charge as the
equipment. Correct use of an antistatic mat and a wrist strap will prevent an electrical
charge from causing damage to computer components.
Demonstrate Proper Use of Various Hand Tools
A technician needs to be able to properly use each tool in the tool kit. This topic covers
many of the various hand tools used when repairing computers.
Screws
Match each screw with the proper screwdriver. Place the tip of the screwdriver on the head
of the screw. Turn the screwdriver clockwise to tighten the screw and counterclockwise to
loosen the screw.
Screws can become stripped if you overtighten them with a screwdriver. A stripped screw,
shown in Figure 2-10, can get stuck in the screw hole, or it might not tighten firmly.
Discard stripped screws.
Figure 2-10
Stripped Screw
Chapter 2: Safe Lab Procedures and Tool Use
21
Flat Head Screwdriver
Use a flat head screwdriver when you are working with a slotted screw. Do not use a flat
head screwdriver to remove a Phillips head screw. Also, do not use a screwdriver as a pry
bar. If any component requires prying, you might have overlooked a clip or latch that can be
holding the component in place.

Caution
If excessive force is needed to remove or add a component, something is probably wrong. Take a sec-
ond look to make sure that you have not missed something that is holding the component in place.
Check the device manual or diagram for additional information.
Phillips Head Screwdriver
Use a Phillips head screwdriver with crosshead screws. Do not use this type of screwdriver
to puncture anything. This will damage the head of the screwdriver.
Hex Drivers
As shown in Figure 2-11, use a hex driver to loosen and tighten bolts that have a hexagonal
(six-sided) head. Hex bolts should not be overtightened because the threads of the bolts can
be stripped. Do not use a hex driver that is too large for the bolt that you are turning.
Figure 2-11
Hex Driver
22
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Caution
Some tools are magnetized. When working around electronic devices, be sure that the tools you are
using have not been magnetized. Magnetic fields can be harmful to data stored on magnetic media.
Test your tool by touching the tool with a screw. If the screw sticks to the tool, do not use the tool.
Part Retriever, Needle-Nose Pliers, or Tweezers
As shown in Figure 2-12, the part retriever, needle-nose pliers, or tweezers can be used to
place and retrieve parts that can be hard to reach with your fingers. Do not scratch or hit
any components when using these tools.

Figure 2-12
Component Retrieving Tools
Chapter 2: Safe Lab Procedures and Tool Use
23
Part retriever
Tweezers
Needle-nose pliers
Caution
Pencils should not be used inside the computer to change the setting of switches or to pry off
jumpers. The pencil lead can act as a conductor and can damage the computer components.
Demonstrate Proper Use of Cleaning Materials
Keeping computers clean inside and out is a vital part of a maintenance program. Dirt can
cause problems with the physical operation of fans, buttons, and other mechanical compo-
nents. On electrical components, an excessive buildup of dust will act like an insulator and
trap the heat. This insulation will impair the ability of heat sinks and cooling fans to keep
components cool, causing chips and circuits to overheat and fail.
Caution
Before cleaning any device, turn it off and unplug the device from the power source.
Cleaning Computer Cases and Monitors
Clean computer cases and the outside of monitors with a mild cleaning solution on a damp,
lint-free cloth. Mix one drop of dishwashing liquid with four ounces of water to create the
cleaning solution. If any water drips inside the case, allow enough time for the liquid to dry
before powering on the computer.
Cleaning LCD Screens
Do not use ammoniated glass cleaners or any other solution on an LCD screen unless the
cleaner is specifically designed for the purpose. Harsh chemicals will damage the coating

on the screen. There is no glass protecting these screens, so be gentle when cleaning them
and do not press firmly on the screen.
Cleaning CRT Screens
To clean the screens of CRT monitors, dampen a soft, clean, lint-free cloth with distilled
water and wipe the screen from top to bottom. Do not spray the glass cleaner directly onto
the display.
Note
Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe the screen and remove any streaking after you have cleaned the monitor.
Clean dusty components with a can of compressed air. Compressed air does not cause elec-
trostatic buildup on components. Make sure that you are either outside or in a well-ventilat-
ed area before blowing the dust out of the computer. A best practice is to wear a dust mask
to make sure that you do not breathe in the dust particles. You might need more than one
can for larger jobs. As you use a can of compressed air, the force of the air will diminish.
Alternate using each can of air so that each can has time to recharge.
Note
Blow out the dust using short bursts from the can. Never tip or use the compressed air can upside
down. Do not allow the fan blades to spin from the force of the compressed air. Hold the fan in place.
Fan motors can be ruined from spinning when the motor is not turned on. Do not allow the tip of the
nozzle to touch the components because ESD can form at the nozzle tip. 
Cleaning Component Contacts
Clean the contacts on components with isopropyl alcohol. Do not use rubbing alcohol.
Rubbing alcohol contains impurities that can damage contacts. Make sure that the contacts
do not collect lint from the cloth or cotton swab. Blow any lint off the contacts with com-
pressed air before reinstallation.
Cleaning Keyboards
Clean a desktop keyboard with compressed air or a small, handheld vacuum cleaner with a
brush attachment.
Caution
Never use a vacuum cleaner inside a computer case or on a laptop keyboard. The plastic parts of the
vacuum cleaner can build static electricity and discharge to the components. Use compressed air to
clean a laptop keyboard.
24
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Cleaning a Mouse
Use glass cleaner and a soft cloth to clean the outside of the mouse. Do not spray glass
cleaner directly on the mouse. If cleaning a ball mouse, you can remove the ball and clean
it with glass cleaner and a soft cloth. Wipe the rollers clean inside the mouse with the same
cloth. You might need to use a nail file to clean the rollers on the mouse. Do not spray liq-
uids inside the mouse.
The following list documents the computer items that you should clean and the cleaning
materials you should use in each case:
■Computer case and outside of monitor: Mild cleaning solution of dishwashing liquid
and water
■LCD screen: Mild cleaning solution of dishwashing liquid and water
■CRT screen: Glass cleaner and soft cloth (spray on the cloth, not on the screen)
■Heat sink: Compressed air
■RAM stick: Isopropyl alcohol and some Q-tips

Assembling computers is a large part of a technician’s job. As a technician, you will need to
work in a logical, methodical manner when working with computer components. As with
any learned trade, your computer assembly skills will improve dramatically with practice.
Open the Case
Computer cases are produced in a variety of form factors. Form factors refer to the size and
shape of the case.
Prepare the workspace before opening the computer case. There should be adequate light-
ing, good ventilation, and a comfortable room temperature. The workbench or table should
be accessible from all sides. Avoid cluttering the surface of the workbench or table with
tools and computer components. An antistatic mat on the table will help prevent physical
and electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage to equipment. Small containers can be used to
hold screws and other parts as you remove them.
There are different methods of opening cases. To learn how to open a particular computer
case, consult the user manual or manufacturer’s website. Most computer cases are opened
in one of the following ways:
■The computer case cover can be removed as one piece.
■The case’s top and side panels can be removed.
■The top of the case may need to be removed before the side panels can be removed.
Install the Power Supply
A technician may be required to replace or install a power supply, as shown in Figure 3-1.
Most power supplies can fit only one way in the computer case. Usually, three or four
screws attach the power supply to the case. Power supplies have fans that can vibrate and
loosen screws that are not secured. When installing a power supply, make sure that all the
screws are used and that they are properly tightened.
These are the power supply installation steps:
Step 1.
Insert the power supply into the case.
Step 2.
Align the holes in the power supply with the holes in the case.
Step 3.
Secure the power supply to the case using the proper screws.

Attach the Components to the Motherboard
and Install the Motherboard
This section details the steps to install components on the motherboard and then install the
motherboard into the computer case.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Install a CPU and a heat sink/fan assembly.
■Install the RAM.
■Install the motherboard.
Install a CPU and a Heat Sink/Fan Assembly
The central processing unit (CPU) and the heat sink/fan assembly may be installed on the
motherboard before the motherboard is placed in the computer case.

Figure 3-2 shows a close-up view of the CPU and the motherboard. The CPU and mother-
board are sensitive to electrostatic discharge. When handling a CPU and motherboard, make
sure that you place them on a grounded antistatic mat. You should wear an antistatic wrist
strap while working with these components.
Figure 3-2
CPU and Motherboard

IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide
Caution
When handling a CPU, do not touch the CPU contacts at any time.
The CPU is secured to the socket on the motherboard with a locking assembly. CPU sock-
ets today are zero insertion force (ZIF) sockets. You should be familiar with the locking
assembly before attempting to install a CPU into the socket on the motherboard.
Thermal compound helps keep the CPU cool. Figure 3-3 shows thermal compound being
applied to the CPU.
When you are installing a used CPU, clean the CPU and the base of the heat sink with iso-
propyl alcohol. Doing this removes all traces of old thermal compound. The surfaces are
now ready for a new layer of thermal compound. Follow all manufacturer recommendations
about applying the thermal compound.

Figure 3-3
Thermal Compound on the CPU
Chapter 3: Computer Assembly Step by Step

board. 
Install the RAM
Like the CPU and the heat sink/fan assembly, random-access memory (RAM) is installed
in the motherboard before the motherboard is secured in the computer case. Before you
install a memory module, consult the motherboard documentation or website of the manu-
facturer to ensure that the RAM is compatible with the motherboard.
RAM provides temporary data storage for the CPU while the computer is operating. RAM
is volatile memory, which means that its contents are lost when the computer is shut down.
Typically, more RAM enhances your computer’s performance.
Follow these steps for RAM installation:
Step 1.
Align the notches on the RAM module to the keys in the slot, and press down
until the side tabs click into place.
Step 2.
Make sure that the side tabs have locked the RAM module. Visually check for
exposed contacts.
Repeat these steps for additional RAM modules.

PATA cable usually has three 40-pin connectors. One connector at the end of the cable con-
nects to the motherboard. The other two connectors connect to drives. The end of the PATA
cable is keyed and can be inserted only one way.
A stripe on the data cable denotes pin 1. Plug the PATA cable into the drive with the pin 1
indicator on the cable aligned to the pin 1 indicator on the drive connector. The pin 1 indi-
cator on the drive connector is usually closest to the power connector on the drive. Many
motherboards have two PATA drive controllers, which provides support for a maximum of
four PATA drives.
SATA Data Cables
The serial advanced technology attachment (SATA) data cable has a seven-pin connector.
One end of the cable is connected to the motherboard. The other end is connected to any
drive that has a SATA data connector. 
Floppy Data Cables
The floppy drive data cable has a 34-pin connector. Like the PATA data cable, the floppy
drive data cable has a stripe to denote the location of pin 1. A floppy drive data cable usual-
ly has three 34-pin connectors. One connector at the end of the cable connects to the moth-
erboard. The other two connectors connect to drives. If multiple floppy drives are installed,
the A: drive connects to the end connector after the twist in the cable. The B: drive connects
to the middle connector.
Plug the floppy drive data cable into the drive with the pin 1 indicator on the cable aligned
to the pin 1 indicator on the drive connector. Motherboards have one floppy drive controller,
which provides support for a maximum of two floppy drives.
Note
If pin 1 on the floppy drive data cable is not aligned with pin 1 on the drive connector, the floppy
drive will not function. This misalignment will not damage the drive, but the drive activity light will
display continuously. To fix this problem, turn off the computer and reconnect the data cable so that
pin 1 on the cable and pin 1 on the connector are aligned. Reboot the computer. 
Data Cable Installation
Follow these steps for data cable installation:
Step 1.

IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide
Identify Beep Codes
POST checks to see that all the hardware in the computer is operating correctly. If a device
is malfunctioning, an error or beep code alerts the technician that a problem has occurred.
Typically, a single beep denotes that the computer is functioning properly. If a hardware
problem exists, the computer may emit a series of beeps. Each BIOS manufacturer uses dif-
ferent codes to indicate hardware problems. Table 3-1 is a sample chart of beep codes. The
beep codes for your computer may be different. Consult the motherboard documentation to
view beep codes for your computer.

Describe the BIOS Setup
The BIOS contains a setup program used to configure settings for hardware devices. The
configuration data is saved to a special memory chip called a complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS). CMOS is maintained by the battery in the computer. If this battery
dies, all BIOS setup configuration data is lost. If this occurs, replace the battery and recon-
figure the BIOS settings.
To enter the BIOS setup program, you must press the proper key or key sequence during
POST. Most computers use the Delete key. Your computer may use another key or combina-
tion of keys, as specified during the boot process.

This chapter introduces preventive maintenance and the troubleshooting process. Preventive
maintenance is a regular and systematic inspection, cleaning, and replacement of worn
parts, materials, and systems. Preventive maintenance helps to prevent failure of parts,
materials, and systems by ensuring that they are in good working order. Troubleshooting is
a systematic approach to locating the cause of a fault in a computer system. A good preven-
tive maintenance program helps minimize failures. With fewer failures, there is less trou-
bleshooting to do, thus saving an organization time and money. Preventive maintenance can
also include upgrading certain hardware or software such as a hard drive that is making
noise, upgrading memory that is insufficient, or installing software updates for security or
reliability.
Troubleshooting is a learned skill. Not all troubleshooting processes are the same, and tech-
nicians tend to refine their troubleshooting skills based on knowledge and personal experi-
ence. Use the guidelines in this chapter as a starting point to help develop your trou-
bleshooting skills. Although each situation is different, the process described in this chapter
will help you to determine your course of action when you are trying to solve a technical
problem for a customer.
Explain the Purpose of Preventive Maintenance
Preventive maintenance is used to reduce the probability of hardware or software problems
by systematically and periodically checking hardware and software to ensure proper operation.
Check the condition of cables, components, and peripherals. Clean components to reduce
the likelihood of overheating. Repair or replace components that show signs of abuse or
excess wear. Use the following tasks as a guide to create a hardware maintenance program:
■Remove dust from fan intakes.
■Remove dust from the power supply.
■Remove dust from components inside the computer.
■Clean the mouse and keyboard.
■Check and secure loose cables.
Verify that installed software is current. Follow the policies of the organization when
installing security updates, operating system updates, and program updates. Many organiza-
tions do not allow updates until extensive testing has been completed. This testing is done
to confirm that the update will not cause problems with the operating system and software.
Use the tasks listed as a guide to create a software maintenance schedule that fits the needs
of your computer equipment:
■Review security updates
■Review software updates
2
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Review driver updates
■Update virus definition files
■Scan for viruses and spyware
■Remove unwanted programs
■Scan hard drives for errors
■Defragment hard drives
Be proactive in computer equipment maintenance and data protection. By performing regu-
lar maintenance routines, you can reduce potential hardware and software problems. Doing
this will reduce computer downtime and repair costs.
A preventive maintenance plan is developed based on the needs of the equipment. A com-
puter exposed to a dusty environment, such as a construction site, will need more attention
than equipment in an office environment. High-traffic networks, such as a school network,
can require additional scanning and removal of malicious software or unwanted files.
Document the routine maintenance tasks that must be performed on the computer equip-
ment and the frequency of each task. This list of tasks can then be used to create a mainte-
nance program. Remember, the more you use your computer, the more frequently you
should perform preventive maintenance. This can include doing a defragmentation of the
hard drive weekly rather than monthly, continually scanning files for viruses rather than
performing a scan once a week, and checking for updates for software and hardware every
two weeks rather than monthly. 
Some benefits of preventive maintenance include the following:
■Increases data protection
■Extends the life of the components
■Increases equipment stability
■Reduces repair costs
■Reduces the number of equipment failures
Identify the Steps of the Troubleshooting
Process
Troubleshooting requires an organized and logical approach to problems with computers
and other components. A logical approach to troubleshooting allows you to eliminate vari-
ables in a systematic order. Asking the right questions, testing the right hardware, and
examining the right data help you understand the problem. This helps you form a proposed
solution.
Chapter 4: Basics of Preventive Maintenance and Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting is a skill that you will refine over time. Each time you solve another prob-
lem, you will increase your troubleshooting skills by gaining more experience. You will
learn how and when to combine, as well as skip, steps to reach a solution quickly. The trou-
bleshooting process is a guideline that you can modify to fit your needs.
In the following sections, you will learn an approach to problem solving that you can apply
to both hardware and software. You also can apply many of the steps to problem solving in
other work-related areas.
The troubleshooting process consists of the following steps:
Step 1.
Gather data from the customer.
Step 2.
Verify the obvious.
Step 3.
Try quick or less intensive solutions first.
Step 4.
Gather data from the computer.
Step 5.
Evaluate the problem and implement the solution.
Step 6.
Close with the customer.
It is best to follow this process and document the process as you go through it. This will
help you to identify solutions the next time you encounter a similar problem and help you
work backward if you made unwanted changes.
Note
The term customer, as used in this course, is any user that requires technical computer assistance.
After completing the following sections, you will be able to explain the purpose of data
protection and perform each step in the troubleshooting process.
Explain the Purpose of Data Protection
Before you begin troubleshooting problems, always follow the necessary precautions to
protect data on a computer. Some repairs, such as replacing a hard drive or reinstalling an
operating system, can put the data on the computer at risk. Make sure that you do every-
thing possible to prevent data loss while attempting repairs.
Caution
Although data protection is not one of the six troubleshooting steps, you must protect data before
beginning any work on a customer’s computer. If your work results in data loss for the customer, you
or your company could be held liable.
A backup is a copy of the data on a computer hard drive that is saved to media such as a
CD, DVD, or tape drive. In an organization, backups are routinely done on a daily, weekly,
and monthly basis.
4
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
How To

If you are unsure that a backup has been done, do not attempt any troubleshooting activities
until you check with the customer. Here is a list of items to verify with the customer about
data backups:
■Date of the last backup
■Contents of the backup
■Data integrity of the backup
■Availability of all backup media for a data restore
If the customer does not have a current backup and you are not able to create one, you
should ask the customer to sign a liability release form. A liability release form should con-
tain at least the following information:
■Permission to work on the computer without a current backup available
■Release from liability if data is lost or corrupted
■Description of the work to be performed
Gather Data from the Customer
During the troubleshooting process, gather as much information from the customer as possi-
ble. The customer will provide you with the basic facts about the problem. Here is a list of
some of the important information to gather from the customer:
■Customer information
■Company name
■Contact name
■Address
■Phone number
■Computer configuration
■Manufacturer and model
■Operating system information
■Network environment
■Connection type
■Description of problem
■Open-ended questions
■Closed-ended questions
Chapter 4: Basics of Preventive Maintenance and Troubleshooting
5

When you are talking to the customer, you should follow these guidelines:
■Ask direct questions to gather information.
■Do not use industry jargon when talking to customers.
■Do not talk down to the customer.
■Do not insult the customer.
■Do not accuse the customer of causing the problem.
By communicating effectively, you will be able to elicit the most relevant information about
the problem from the customer.
When gathering information from customers, use both open-ended and closed-ended ques-
tions. Start with open-ended questions to obtain general information. Open-ended questions
allow customers to explain the details of the problem in their own words. Some examples of
open-ended questions are
■What problems are you experiencing with your computer or network?
■What software has been installed on your computer recently?
■What were you doing when the problem was identified?
■What hardware changes have recently been made to your computer?
Based on the information from the customer, you can proceed with closed-ended questions.
Closed-ended questions generally require a yes or no answer. These questions are intended
to get the most relevant information in the shortest time possible. Some examples of closed-
ended questions are
■Has anyone else used your computer recently?
■Can you reproduce the problem?
■Have you changed your password recently?
■Have you received any error messages on your computer?
■Are you currently logged in to the network?
The information obtained from the customer should be documented in the work order and
in the repair journal. The work order is a record of what was done and the time that it took
to make the repair. The repair journal is a written record of anything that was learned during
the repair that can help you on future projects. Write down anything that you think might be
important for you or another technician. Often, the small details can lead to the solution of
a difficult problem.
6
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Verify the Obvious Issues
The second step in the troubleshooting process is to verify the obvious issues. Even though
the customer might think that there is a major problem, start with the obvious issues before
moving to more complex diagnoses. 
Verify the following obvious issues:
■Loose external cable connections.
■Incorrect boot order in BIOS.
■Nonbootable disk in floppy drive.
■Power switch for an outlet is turned off.
■Surge protector is turned off.
■Device is powered off.
If you find an obvious issue that fixes the problem, you can go to the last step and close
with the customer. These steps are simply a guideline to help you solve problems in an effi-
cient manner. If the problem is not resolved when you verify the obvious issues, you will
need to continue with the troubleshooting process.
Try Quick Solutions First
The next step in the troubleshooting process is to try quick solutions first. Obvious issues
and quick solutions sometimes overlap each other and can be used together to repair the
problem. Document each solution that you try. Information about the solutions that you
have tried is vital if the problem needs to be escalated to another technician.
Some common quick solutions include
■Check that all cables are connected to the proper ports.
■Remove and reconnect cables.
■Reboot the computer or network device.
■Log in as a different user.
■Check computer for the latest OS patches and updates.
If a quick solution does not resolve the problem, document your results and try the next
most likely solution. Continue this process until you have solved the problem or have tried
all the quick solutions. Document the resolution for future reference.
Chapter 4: Basics of Preventive Maintenance and Troubleshooting
7

Gather Data from the Computer
The next step in the troubleshooting process is to gather data from the computer. You have
tried all the quick solutions, but the problem is still not resolved. It is now time to verify the
customer’s description of the problem by gathering data from the computer.
To help gather information from the computer, you will need to be aware of some of the
most common utilities or features of a computer. These utilities or features include the
Event Viewer, Device Manager, BIOS information and beep codes, and various diagnostic
tools.
Event Viewer
When system, user, or software errors occur on a computer, the Event Viewer is updated
with information about the errors. The Event Viewer application, shown in Figure 4-1,
records the following information about the problem:
■The problem that occurred
■The date and time of the problem
■The severity of the problem
■The source of the problem
■Event ID number
■The user who was logged in when the problem occurred
Figure 4-1
Event Viewer

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Although this utility lists details about the error, you might still need to research the
solution.
Device Manager
The Device Manager, shown in Figure 4-2, displays all the devices that are configured on a
computer. Any device that the operating system determines to be acting incorrectly will be
flagged with an error icon. This type of error is denoted as a yellow circle with an exclama-
tion point (!). If a device is disabled, it will be flagged with a red circle and an X. 
Figure 4-2
Device Manager
Chapter 4: Basics of Preventive Maintenance and Troubleshooting
9
Beep Codes
Each BIOS manufacturer has a unique beep sequence for hardware failures. When trou-
bleshooting, power on the computer and then listen. As the system proceeds through the
power-on self test (POST), most computers will emit one beep to indicate that the system is
booting properly. If there is an error, you might hear multiple beeps. Document the beep
code sequence, and research the code to determine the specific hardware failure.
BIOS Information
If the computer boots and stops after the POST, you should investigate the BIOS settings to
determine where to find the problem. A device might not be detected or configured proper-
ly. Refer to the motherboard manual to make sure that the BIOS settings are accurate.

Diagnostic Tools
Conduct research to determine what software is available to help diagnose and solve prob-
lems. There are many programs available that can help you troubleshoot hardware. Often,
manufacturers of system hardware provide their own diagnostic tools. A hard drive manu-
facturer, for example, might provide a tool that can be used to boot the computer and diag-
nose problems with the hard drive when it will not start Windows.
Evaluate the Problem and Implement the Solution
The next step in the troubleshooting process is to evaluate the problem and implement the
solution. When researching possible solutions for a problem, use the following sources of
information:
■Your own problem-solving experience
■Other technicians
■Internet search
■Newsgroups
■Manufacturer FAQs
■Computer manuals
■Device manuals
■Online forums
■Technical websites
Divide larger problems into smaller problems that you can analyze and solve individually.
You should prioritize solutions, starting with the easiest and fastest to implement. Create a
list of possible solutions and implement them one at a time. If you implement a possible
solution and it does not work, reverse the solution and try another.
Close with the Customer
After the repairs to the computer have been completed, finish the troubleshooting process
by closing with the customer. Communicate the problem and the solution to the customer
verbally and in all documentation. The steps to be taken when you have finished a repair
and are closing with the customer include
■Discuss the solution implemented with the customer.
■Have the customer verify that the problem has been solved.
■Provide the customer with all paperwork.
10
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Document the steps taken to solve the problem in the work order and in the techni-
cian’s journal.
■Document any components used in the repair.
■Document the amount of time spent to resolve the problem.
Verify the solution with the customer. If the customer is available, demonstrate how the
solution has corrected the computer problem. Have the customer test the solution and try to
reproduce the problem. When the customer can verify that the problem has been resolved,
you can complete the documentation for the repair in the work order and in your journal.
The documentation should include the following information:
■The description of the problem
■The steps to resolve the problem
■The components used in the repair

The operating system (OS) controls almost all functions on a computer. In this chapter, you
will learn about the components, functions, and terminology related to the Windows 2000
and Windows XP operating systems.
Explain the Purpose of an Operating System
All computers rely on an operating system (OS) to provide the interface for interaction
among users, applications, and hardware. The operating system also manages the file sys-
tem. Almost all modern operating systems can support more than one user, task, or CPU.
Roles of an operating system include
■Control hardware access
■Manage files and folders
■Provide user interface
■Manage applications
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe characteristics of modern operating systems
■Explain operating system concepts
Describe Characteristics of Modern Operating
Systems
Regardless of the size and complexity of the computer and the operating system, all operat-
ing systems perform the same four basic functions:
■Control hardware access
■Manage files and folders
■Provide a user interface
■Manage applications
Control Hardware Access
The operating system manages the interaction between applications and the hardware. To
access and communicate with the hardware, the operating system installs a device driver for
each hardware component. A device driver is a small program written by the hardware man-
ufacturer and supplied with the hardware component. When the hardware device is
installed, the device driver is also installed, allowing the OS to communicate with the hard-
ware component. 
Chapter 5: Fundamental Operating Systems
115

The process of assigning system resources and installing drivers can be performed with
Plug and Play (PnP). The PnP process was introduced in Windows 95 to simplify the instal-
lation of new hardware. All modern operating systems are PnP compatible. With PnP, the
operating system automatically detects the PnP-compatible hardware and installs the driver
for that component. The operating system then configures the device and updates the reg-
istry, which is a database that contains all the information about the computer.
Note
The registry contains information about applications, users, hardware, network settings, and file
types.
File and Folder Management
The operating system creates a file structure on the hard disk drive to allow data to be
stored. A file is a block of related data that is given a single name and treated as a single
unit. Program and data files are grouped together in a directory. The files and directories are
organized for easy retrieval and use. Directories can be kept inside other directories. These
nested directories are referred to as subdirectories. Directories are called folders in
Windows operating systems, and subdirectories are called subfolders. 
The file structure on the hard drive is stored in a table called a file allocation table for
Windows. This table contains the location where all the separate blocks, or clusters, that
make up a file are located on the physical hard drive. The table format and cluster size for
Windows vary depending on how the hard drive was formatted. The format for the file
structure can be FAT, FAT32, and NTFS. These formats will be discussed later in the chap-
ter in the section “Prepare Hard Drive.”
User Interface
The operating system enables the user to interact with software and hardware. There are
two types of user interfaces:
■Command-line interface (CLI): The user types commands at a prompt, as shown in
Figure 5-1.
■Graphical user interface (GUI): The user interacts with menus and icons, as shown in
Figure 5-2.
Most operating systems, such as Windows 2000 and Windows XP, include both a GUI and
a CLI.

Graphical User Interface
Application Management
The operating system locates an application and loads it into the RAM of the computer.
Applications are software programs, such as word processors, databases, spreadsheets,
games, and many other applications. The operating system ensures that each application has
adequate system resources.

An application programming interface (API) is a set of guidelines used by programmers to
ensure that the application they are developing is compatible with an operating system. Two
examples of APIs are:
■Open Graphics Library (OpenGL): Cross-platform standard specification for multi-
media graphics
■DirectX: Collection of APIs related to multimedia tasks for Microsoft Windows
Explain Operating System Concepts
To understand the capabilities of an operating system, it is important to understand some
basic terms. The following terms are often used when comparing operating systems:
■Multiuser: Two or more users can work with programs and files and share peripheral
devices at the same time.
■Multitasking: The computer is capable of operating multiple applications at the same
time.
■Multiprocessing: The computer can have two or more central processing units (CPU)
that programs share.
■Multithreading: A program can be broken into smaller parts that can be loaded as need-
ed by the operating system. Multithreading allows individual programs to be multi-
tasked.
Almost all modern operating systems are multiuser and multitasking, and they support mul-
tiprocessing and multithreading.
Modes of Operation
All modern CPUs can run in different modes of operation. The mode of operation refers to
the capability of the CPU and the operating environment. The mode of operation determines
how the CPU will manage applications and memory. The four common modes of operation
are as follows:
■Real mode
■Protected mode
■Virtual real mode
■Compatible mode
Memory allocation will determine where applications are stored in memory. Table 5-1
shows an example of the logical memory allocation.

Logical Memory Allocation
Conventional
0 to 640 KB
Upper

Extended
1 MB to the maximum amount of RAM installed
The sections that follow describe these modes of operation in greater detail.
Real Mode
A CPU that operates in real mode can only execute one program at a time, and it can only
address 1 MB of system memory at a time. Although all modern processors have real mode
available, it is only used by DOS and DOS applications or by 16-bit operating systems,
such as Windows 3.x. In real mode, when an application creates an error, the entire comput-
er can be affected because the program has direct access to memory. This can cause the
computer to stop responding, restart, or shut down due to corruption of the memory space.
Table 5-2 is a chart of some common DOS commands that can still be used in modern oper-
ating systems, such as Windows XP.

Protected Mode
A CPU that operates in protected mode has access to all the memory in the computer,
including virtual memory. Virtual memory is hard disk space that is used to emulate RAM.
Operating systems that use protected mode can manage multiple programs simultaneously.
Protected mode provides 32-bit access to memory, drivers, and transfers between input and
output (I/O) devices. Protected mode is used by 32-bit operating systems, such as Windows
2000 and Windows XP. In protected mode, applications are protected from using the memo-
ry reserved for another application that is currently running.
Virtual Real Mode
A CPU that operates in virtual real mode allows a real-mode application to run within a
protected-mode operating system. This can be demonstrated when a DOS application runs
in a 32-bit operating system, such as Windows XP.
Compatibility Mode
Compatibility mode creates the environment of an earlier operating system for applications
that are not compatible with the current operating system. As an example, an application
that checks the version of the operating system can be written for Windows NT and require
a particular service pack. Compatibility mode can create the proper environment or version
of the operating system to allow the application to run as if it is in the intended environ-
ment. 
Describe and Compare Operating Systems to
Include Purpose, Limitations, and
Compatibilities
A technician can be asked to choose and install an operating system for a customer. The
type of OS selected depends on the customer’s requirements for the computer. There are
two distinct types of operating systems:
■Desktop operating systems: A desktop operating system is intended for use in a small
office/home office (SOHO) with a limited number of users.
■Network operating systems: A network operating system (NOS) is designed for a cor-
porate environment serving multiple users with a wide range of needs.
After completing the following sections, you will meet the following objectives:
■Describe desktop operating systems
■Describe network operating systems
120
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide

Describe Desktop Operating Systems
A desktop OS has the following characteristics:
■Supports a single user
■Runs single-user applications
■Shares files and folders on a small network with limited security
In the current software market, the most commonly used desktop operating systems fall into
three groups:
■Microsoft Windows: Windows is one of the most popular operating systems today.
The following products are desktop versions of the Microsoft Windows operating
systems:
■Windows XP Professional: Used on most computers that will connect to a
Windows server on a network
■Windows XP Home Edition: Used on home computers and has very limited
security
■Windows XP Media Center: Used on entertainment computers for viewing
movies and listening to music
■Windows XP Tablet PC Edition: Used for tablet PCs
■Windows XP 64-bit Edition: Used for computers with 64-bit processors
■Windows 2000 Professional: Older Windows operating system that has been
replaced by Windows XP Professional 
■Windows Vista: Newest version of Windows
■Apple Mac OS: Apple computers are proprietary and use an operating system called
Mac OS. Mac OS is designed to be a user-friendly GUI operating system. Current ver-
sions of Mac OS are now based on a customized version of UNIX.
■UNIX/Linux: UNIX, which was introduced in the late 1960s, is one of the oldest oper-
ating systems. There are many different versions of UNIX today. One of the most
recent is the extremely popular Linux. Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991,
and it is designed as an open-source operating system. Open-source programs allow the
source code to be distributed and changed by anyone as a free download or from devel-
opers at a much lower cost than other operating systems. 
Chapter 5: Fundamental Operating Systems
121

Describe Network Operating Systems
A network OS has the following characteristics:
■Supports multiple users
■Runs multiuser applications
■Is robust and redundant
■Provides increased security compared to desktop operating systems
The most commonly used network operating systems are as follows:
■Microsoft Windows: Network operating systems offered by Microsoft are Windows
2000 Server and Windows Server 2003. Windows Server operating systems use a cen-
tral database called Active Directory to manage network resources.
■Novell NetWare: Novell NetWare was the first OS to meet network OS requirements
and enjoy widespread deployment in PC-based LANs back in the 1980s.
■Linux: Linux operating systems include Red Hat, Caldera, SuSE, Debian, and
Slackware.
■UNIX: Various corporations offered proprietary operating systems based on UNIX.
Worksheet 5.2.2: NOS Certifications and Jobs
In this activity, you will use the Internet, a newspaper, or magazines to gather information
about network operating system certifications and jobs that require these certifications.
Refer to the worksheet in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide,
Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can complete this worksheet now or wait to do
so until the end of the chapter. 
Determine Operating System Based on
Customer Needs
To select the proper operating system to meet the requirements of your customer, you need
to understand how the customer wants to use the computer. The operating system that you
recommend should be compatible with any applications that will be used and should sup-
port all hardware that is installed in the computer. If the computer will be attached to a net-
work, the new operating system should also be compatible with other operating systems on
the network.
122
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide

After completing the following sections, you will meet the following objectives:
■Identify applications and environments that are compatible with an operating system
■Determine minimum hardware requirements and compatibility with the OS platform
Identify Applications and Environments That Are
Compatible with an Operating System
An operating system should be compatible with all applications that are installed on a com-
puter. Before recommending an OS to your customer, investigate the types of applications
that your customer will be using. If the computer will be part of a network, the operating
system must also be compatible with the operating systems of the other computers in the
network. The network type determines what operating systems are compatible. Microsoft
Windows networks can have multiple computers using different versions of Microsoft oper-
ating systems. The following questions offer guidelines that will help you determine the
best operating system for your customer:
■Does the computer have “off-the-shelf” applications or customized applications
that were programmed specifically for this customer? If the customer will be using
a customized application, the programmer of that application will specify which operat-
ing system is compatible with it. Most off-the-shelf applications specify a list of com-
patible operating systems on the outside of the application package.
■Are the applications programmed for a single user or multiple users? This infor-
mation will help you decide whether to recommend a desktop OS or a network OS. If
the computer will be connected to a network, make sure to recommend the same OS
platform that the other computers on the network use.
■Are any data files shared with other computers, such as a laptop or home comput-
er? To ensure compatibility of file formats, recommend the same OS platform that the
other data file–sharing computers use.
As an example, your customer might have a Windows network installed and want to add
more computers to the network. In this case, you should recommend a Windows OS for the
new computers. If the customer does not have any existing computer equipment, the choice
of available OS platforms increases. To make an OS recommendation, you will need to
review budget constraints, learn how the computer will be used, and determine what types
of applications will be installed. 
Determine Minimum Hardware Requirements and
Compatibility with the OS Platform
Operating systems have minimum hardware requirements that must be met for the OS to
install and function correctly. Table 5-3 is a chart of the minimum hardware requirements
for Windows 2000, Windows XP Pro, and Windows XP Home operating systems.

Identify the equipment that your customer has in place. If hardware upgrades are necessary
to meet the minimum requirements for an OS, conduct a cost analysis to determine the best
course of action. In some cases, it can be less expensive for the customer to purchase a new
computer than to upgrade the current system. In other cases, it can be cost effective to
upgrade one or more of the following components:
■RAM
■Hard disk drive
■CPU
■Video adapter card
124
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide

Note
In some cases, the application requirements can exceed the hardware requirements of the operating
system. For the application to function properly, it will be necessary to satisfy the additional require-
ments.
After you have determined the minimum hardware requirements for an OS, you should
ensure that all the hardware in the computer is compatible with the operating system that
you have selected for your customer.
Hardware Compatibility List
Most operating systems have a hardware compatibility list (HCL) that can be found on the
manufacturer’s website, as shown in Figure 5-3. These lists provide a detailed inventory of
hardware that has been tested and is known to work with the operating system. If any of
your customer’s existing hardware is not on the list, those components might need to be
upgraded to match components on the HCL.
Figure 5-3
Hardware Compatibility List
Chapter 5: Fundamental Operating Systems
125
Note
An HCL might not be continuously maintained and therefore might not be a comprehensive
reference.

Worksheet 5.3.2: Upgrade Hardware Components
In this worksheet, you will use the Internet, a newspaper, or a local store to gather informa-
tion about hardware components. The scenario is that your customer’s computer currently
has 1 module of 256-MB RAM, a 40-GB hard disk drive, and an AGP video adapter card
with 32 MB of RAM. Your customer wants to be able to play advanced video games. Refer
to the worksheet in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third
Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can complete this worksheet now or wait to do so until
the end of the chapter. 
Install an Operating System
As a technician, you might have to perform a clean installation of an operating system.
Perform a clean install in the following situations:
■When a computer is passed from one employee to another
■When the operating system is corrupted
■When a new replacement hard drive is installed in a computer
Figure 5-4 shows an example of the Windows XP installation welcome screen.

After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Identify hard drive setup procedures
■Prepare the hard drive
■Install the operating system using default settings

■Create user accounts
■Complete the installation
■Describe custom installation options
■Identify the boot sequence files and registry files
■Describe how to manipulate operating system files
■Describe directory structures
Identify Hard Drive Setup Procedures
The installation and initial booting of the operating system is called the operating system
setup. Although it is possible to install an operating system over a network from a server or
from a local hard drive, the most common installation method is with CDs and DVDs. To
install an OS from a CD or DVD, first configure the BIOS setup to boot the system from
the CD or DVD. 
Partitioning and Formatting
Before installing an operating system on a hard drive, the hard drive must be partitioned
and formatted. When a hard drive is partitioned, it is logically divided into one or more
areas. When a hard drive is formatted, the partitions are prepared to hold files and applica-
tions. During the installation phase, most operating systems automatically partition and for-
mat the hard drive. A technician should understand the process relating to hard drive setup.
The following terms are used when referring to hard drive setup:
■Primary partition: This partition is usually the first partition. A primary partition can-
not be subdivided into smaller sections. There can be up to four partitions per hard
drive.
■Active partition: This partition is the partition used by the operating system to boot the
computer. Only one primary partition can be marked active.
■Extended partition: This partition normally uses the remaining free space on a hard
drive or takes the place of a primary partition. There can be only one extended partition
per hard drive, and it can be subdivided into smaller sections called logical drives.
■Logical drive: This drive is a section of an extended partition that can be used to sepa-
rate information for administrative purposes.
■Formatting: This process prepares a file system in a partition for files to be stored.
■Cluster: A cluster is also called a file allocation unit. It is the smallest unit of space
used for storing data.
■Track: A track is one complete circle of data on one side of a hard drive platter. A track
is broken into groups of 512 bytes, called sectors.
Chapter 5: Fundamental Operating Systems
127

■Cylinder: A cylinder is a stack of tracks lined up one on top of another to form a cylin-
der shape.
■Drive mapping: Drive mapping is a letter assigned to a physical or logical drive.
Figure 5-5 shows how the different parts of a hard drive correspond.

Prepare Hard Drive
A clean installation of an operating system proceeds as if the disk were brand new; there is
no attempt to preserve any information that is currently on the hard drive. The first phase of
the installation process entails partitioning and formatting the hard drive. This process pre-
pares the disk to accept the file system. The file system provides the directory structure that
organizes the user’s operating system, application, configuration, and data files. 

The Windows XP operating system can use one of two file systems:
■File Allocation Table, 32-bit (FAT32): A file system that can support partition sizes up
to 2 TB, or 2048 GB. The FAT32 file system is supported by Windows 95, Windows
98, Windows Me, Windows 2000, and Windows XP.
■New Technology File System (NTFS): A file system that can support partition sizes up
to 16 exabytes, in theory. (An exabyte is 260 bytes.) NTFS incorporates more file sys-
tem security features and extended attributes than the FAT file system.
Figure 5-6 through Figure 5-10 show the five steps required to partition and format a drive
in Windows XP.

Install the Operating System Using Default Settings
When installing Windows XP, the installation wizard gives the option to install using typical
(default) settings or custom settings. Using the typical settings increases the likelihood of a
successful installation. However, the user must still provide the following information dur-
ing the setup:
■Standards and formats that define currency and numerals
■Text input language
■Name of the user and company
■Product key
■Computer name
■Administrator password
■Date and time settings
■Network settings
■Domain or workgroup information

When a computer boots up with the Windows installation CD, the Windows XP installation
starts with three options:
■Setup XP: To run the setup and install the XP operating system, press Enter.
■Repair XP: To repair an installation, press R to open the Recovery Console.
■Quit: To quit Setup without installing Windows XP, press F3.
Figure 5-11 shows the installation window for Windows XP. 
Figure 5-11
Installing Windows
132
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide
Create Accounts
An administrator account is automatically created when Windows XP is installed. The
default administrator account is named “administrator.” For security purposes, change this
default name as soon as possible. This privileged account should only be used to manage
the computer; it should not be used as a daily account. It is recommended that you create
another account with limited access for daily use. People have accidentally made drastic
changes while using the administrator account instead of a limited user account. Attackers
seek out the administrative account because it is so powerful.
Create a user account when prompted during the installation process. This user account will
have full administrative privileges just like the administrator account. Unlike the adminis-
trator account, user accounts can be created at any time. A user account should have less
permissions than the computer administrator. For example, users might have the right to
read, but not modify, a file.

Tip
Because of the security risks associated with the administrator account, it is recommended that you
rename the administrator account and also disable the account after creating a new account with full
administrative privileges. Because each user account is identified with a security identifier (SID),
changing the name of the administrator account does not change the SID. The SID of the administra-
tor account always begins with the letters S-1-5 and ends with -500. This would allow an attacker to
figure out what account was the default administrator even if it is renamed.
Figure 5-12 shows the installation screen for setting the computer name and setting the ini-
tial administrator password.

133
Complete the Installation
After the Windows installation copies all the necessary operating system files to the hard
drive, the computer will reboot and prompt you to log in for the first time. 
You must register Windows XP. As shown in Figure 5-13, you must also complete the veri-
fication that ensures that you are using a legal copy of the OS. Doing so will enable you to
download patches and service packs. Performing this step requires a connection to the
Internet.
Depending on the age of the media at the time of your installation, there might be updates
to install. As shown in Figure 5-14, you can use the Microsoft Update Manager from the
Start menu (choose Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Windows
Update) to scan for new software and to do the following:
■Install all service packs
■Install all patches

Windows Update
You should also verify that all hardware is installed correctly. As shown in Figure 5-15, you
can use Device Manager to locate problems and to install the correct or updated drivers
using the following path:
Start > Control Panel > System > Hardware > Device Manager

Figure 5-15

In Device Manager, warning icons are represented by a yellow exclamation point (!) or a
red X. A yellow exclamation point represents a problem with the device. To view the prob-
lem description, right-click the device and select Properties. A red X represents a device
that has been disabled. To enable the device, right-click the disabled device and select
Enable. To open a category that is not yet expanded, click the plus sign (+).
Note
When Windows detects a system error, Windows reporting displays a dialog box. If you choose to
send the report, Microsoft Windows error reporting (WER) collects information about the application
and the module involved in the error and sends the information to Microsoft.
Lab 5.4.5: Create Accounts and Check for Updates
In this lab, you will create user accounts and configure the operating system for automatic
updates after the Windows XP Professional installation process. Refer to the lab in IT
Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-
58713-198-6). You can perform this lab now or wait until the end of the chapter.
Describe Custom Installation Options
Installing an operating system on a single computer takes time. Imagine the time it would
take to install operating systems on multiple computers, one at a time, in a large organiza-
tion. To simplify this activity, you can use the Microsoft System Preparation (Sysprep) tool
to install and configure the same operating system on multiple computers. Sysprep prepares
an operating system that will be used on computers with different hardware configurations.
With Sysprep and a disk-cloning application, technicians are able to quickly install an oper-
ating system, complete the last configuration steps for the OS setup, and install applications.

Note
Some commonly used disk-cloning applications include Symantec PowerQuest Drive Image and
Norton Ghost.
Disk cloning creates an image of a hard drive in a computer. Follow these steps for disk
cloning:
Step 1.
Create a master installation on one computer. This master installation includes
the operating system, software applications, and configuration settings that will
be used by the other computers in the organization.
Step 2.
Run Sysprep. You can find the sysprep utility on the Windows XP operating sys-
tem CD by opening the deploy.cab file in the \Support\Tools folder.
Step 3.
Create a disk image of the configured computer using a third-party disk-cloning
program.
Step 4.
Copy the disk image onto a server. When the destination computer is booted, a
shortened version of the Windows setup program runs. The setup will create a
new system security identifier (SID), install drivers for hardware, create user
accounts, and configure network settings to finish the OS install. 
Identify the Boot Sequence Files and Registry Files
You should know the process that Windows XP uses when booting. Understanding these
steps can help you to troubleshoot boot problems. 
The boot sequence for Windows XP is as follows:
1. Power-on self test (POST) is run.
2. POST for each adapter card that has a BIOS is run.
3. BIOS reads the Master Boot Record (MBR).
4. MBR takes over control of the boot process and starts NT Loader (NTLDR).
5. NTLDR reads the boot.ini file to know which OS to load and where to find the OS on
the boot partition.
6. NTLDR uses ntdetect.com to detect any installed hardware.
7. NTLDR loads the ntoskrnl.exe file and hal.dll.
8. NTLDR reads the registry files and loads device drivers.
9. The ntoskrnl.exe file starts the winlogon.exe program and displays the Windows login
screen.

How To

Windows XP Boot Process
To begin the boot process, you first turn on the computer, which is called a cold boot. The
computer performs the power-on self test (POST). Because the video adapter has not yet
been initialized, any errors that occur at this point in the boot process will be reported by a
series of audible tones, called beep codes.
After the POST, the BIOS locates and reads the configuration settings that are stored in the
CMOS. This configuration setting is the order in which devices will be tried to see whether
an operating system is located there. The BIOS boots the computer using the first drive that
contains an operating system.
When the drive with the operating system is located, the BIOS locates the Master Boot
Record (MBR). The MBR locates the operating system boot loader. For Windows XP, the
boot loader is called NT Loader (NTLDR).
NTLDR and the Windows Boot Menu
At this point, NTLDR controls several installation steps. For example, if more than one OS
is present on the disk, boot.ini gives the user a chance to select which one to use. If there
are no other operating systems, or if the user does not make a selection before the timer
expires, the following steps occur:
1. NTLDR runs ntdetect.com to get information about installed hardware.
2. NTLDR then uses the path specified in boot.ini to find the boot partition.
3. NTLDR loads two files that make up the core of XP: ntoskrnl.exe and hal.dll.
4. NTLDR reads the registry files, chooses a hardware profile, and loads device drivers.
Windows Registry
The Windows registry is a hierarchal database used by the Windows operating system to
store information and settings for hardware, software, users, and preferences on a system.
The registry is an important part of the Windows XP boot process. These registry files are
recognized by their distinctive names, which begin with HKEY_, as shown in Table 5-4,
followed by the name of the portion of the operating system under their control. Every set-
ting in Windows—from the background of the desktop and the color of the screen buttons
to the licensing of applications—is stored in the registry. When a user makes changes to the
Control Panel settings, file associations, system policies, or installed software, the changes
are stored in the registry.
Chapter 5: Fundamental Operating Systems

Each user has a unique section of the registry. The Windows login process pulls system set-
tings from the registry to reconfigure the system to the state that it was in the last time that
the user turned it on. 
NT Kernel
At this point, the NT kernel, the heart of the Windows operating system, takes over. The
name of this file is ntoskrnl.exe. It starts the login file called winlogon.exe and displays the
XP welcome screen.
Note
If a SCSI drive will boot the computer, Windows will copy the ntbootdd.sys file during installation.
This file will not be copied if SCSI drives are not being used.
Describe How to Manipulate Operating System Files
After you have installed Windows XP, you might want to make changes to the configura-
tion. The following applications are used extensively for postinstallation modifications:
■Msconfig: This boot configuration utility allows you to set the programs that will run at
startup and to edit configuration files. It also offers simplified control over Windows
Services, as shown in Figure 5-16. To access Msconfig, choose Start > Run, type
msconfig, and press Enter.
■Regedit: This application allows you to edit the registry, as shown in Figure 5-17.
Note
REGEDT32 was used with Windows NT. In Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the
REGEDT32 file is nothing more than a shortcut to the regedit.exe program. In Windows XP, you can
enter regedt32.exe or regedit.exe; both commands run the same program.
138

Chapter 5: Fundamental Operating Systems
139
Figure 5-17
Regedit
Caution
Using regedt32.exe or regedit.exe incorrectly might cause configuration problems that could require
you to reinstall the operating system.
Startup Modes
You can boot Windows in one of many different modes. Pressing F8 during the boot
process opens the Windows Advanced Startup Options menu, which allows you to select
how to boot Windows. The following startup options are commonly used:
■Safe Mode: Starts Windows but only loads drivers for basic components, such as the
keyboard and display.
■Safe Mode with Networking Support: Starts Windows identically to Safe Mode and
also loads the drivers for network components.

■Safe Mode with Command Prompt: Starts Windows and loads the command prompt
instead of the GUI.
■Last Known Good Configuration: Enables a user to load the configuration settings of
Windows that were used the last time that Windows successfully started. It does this by
accessing a copy of the registry that is created for this purpose.
Note
The Last Known Good Configuration option is not useful unless it is applied immediately after a fail-
ure occurs. If the machine is restarted and, despite its difficulties, manages to open Windows, the reg-
istry key for Last Known Good Configuration will probably be updated with the faulty information. 
Describe Directory Structures
In Windows, files are organized in a directory structure. The root level of the Windows par-
tition is usually labeled drive C:\. Next, there is an initial set of standardized directories,
called folders, for the operating system, applications, configuration information, and data
files. Following the initial installation, users can install most applications and data in what-
ever directory they choose.
Files in the directory structure adhere to a Windows naming convention:
■Maximum of 255 characters can be used.
■Characters such as a period (.), a slash (/), and a backslash (\) are not allowed.
■An extension of three or four letters is added to the filename to identify the file type.
■Filenames are not case sensitive.
The following filename extensions are commonly used:
■.doc: Microsoft Word
■.txt: ASCII text only
■.jpg: Graphics format
■.ppt: Microsoft PowerPoint
■.zip: Compression format
The directory structure maintains a set of attributes for each file that controls how the file
can be viewed or altered. The most common file attributes are as follows:
■R: The file is read-only.
■A: The file will be archived the next time that the disk is backed up.
140
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide

■S: The file is marked as a system file and a warning is given if an attempt is made to
delete or modify the file.
■H: The file is hidden in the directory display.
You can view the filenames, extensions, and attributes by entering a DOS window (choose
Start > Run > cmd) and typing the ATTRIB command. Navigate to the folder that con-
tains the file that you are interested in. Type ATTRIB followed by the filename. Use a
wildcard such as *.* to view many files at once. The attributes of each file will appear in
the left column of the screen, as shown in Figure 5-18. 
Figure 5-18
File Attributes
Chapter 5: Fundamental Operating Systems
141
You can find information about the ATTRIB command at the command prompt by typing
the following:
ATTRIB/?
The Windows equivalent of the ATTRIB command can be accessed by right-clicking a file
in Windows Explorer and choosing Properties.
Note
To ensure that you can see the properties of all files in Windows Explorer, choose Tools > Options >
View and select the Show hidden files and folders check box.
NTFS and FAT32 File System
Windows XP and Windows 2000 use FAT32 and NTFS file systems. Security is one of the
most important differences between these file systems. NTFS can support more and larger
files than FAT32 and provides more flexible security features for files and folders. Figure 5-
19 shows the file permission properties of NTFS.

Figure 5-19
NTFS Permissions
142
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide
You can convert partitions from FAT32 to NTFS using the convert.exe utility. Doing this
will provide the extra security advantages of NTFS. To restore an NTFS partition to a
FAT32 partition, reformat the partition and restore the data from a backup.
To perform the conversion process, choose Start > Run and type cmd. At the command
prompt, type convert[driveletter]:/FS:NTFS, where the driveletter is the drive that you
want to convert from FAT or FAT32 to NTFS.
Caution
Before converting a file system, remember to back up the data.
Worksheet 5.4.9: Answer NTFS and FAT32 Questions
In this worksheet, you will answer questions about NTFS and FAT32, which are file sys-
tems used by the Windows XP operating system and provide different file system features.
Refer to the worksheet in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide,
Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can complete this worksheet now or wait to do
so until the end of the chapter. 
Navigate a GUI (Windows)
The operating system provides a user interface that allows you to interact with the comput-
er. There are two methods that you can use to navigate the file system and run applications
within an operating system:

■A graphical user interface (GUI) provides graphical representations (icons) of all the
files, folders, and programs on a computer, as shown in Figure 5-20. You manipulate
these icons using a pointer that is controlled with a mouse or similar device. The
pointer allows you to move icons by dragging and dropping, and execute programs by
clicking.
■A command-line interface (CLI) is text based. You must type commands to manipulate
files and execute programs.

Explore Control Panel Applets
Windows centralizes the settings for many features that control the behavior and appearance
of the computer. These settings are categorized in Control Panel applets, or small programs,
as shown in Figure 5-23. Adding or removing programs, changing network settings, and chang-
ing the security settings are some of the configuration options available in the Control Panel.

Install, Navigate, and Uninstall an Application
As a technician, you will be responsible for adding and removing software from your cus-
tomers’ computers. Most applications use an automatic installation process when an appli-
cation CD is inserted in the optical drive. The installation process updates the Add or

Remove Programs utility. The user is required to click through the installation wizard and
provide information when requested.
Add or Remove Programs Applet
Microsoft recommends that users always use the Add or Remove Programs utility, as shown
in Figure 5-29, when installing or removing applications. When you use the Add or Remove
Programs utility to install an application, the utility tracks installation files so that the appli-
cation can be uninstalled completely, if desired. To open the Add or Remove Programs
applet, use the following path:
Start > Control Panel > Add or Remove Programs
Figure 5-29
Windows Add or Remove Programs

IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide
Add an Application
If a program or application is not automatically installed when the CD is inserted, you can
use the Add or Remove Programs applet to install the application, as shown in Figure 5-30.
Click the Add New Programs button and select the location where the application is locat-
ed. Windows will install the application for you.
After the application is installed, the application can be started from the Start menu or from
a shortcut icon that the application installs on the desktop. Check the application to ensure
that it is functioning properly. If there are problems with the application, make the repair or
uninstall the application. Some applications, such as Microsoft Office, provide a repair
option in the install process. You can use this function to try to correct a program that is not
working properly.

Uninstall an Application
If an application is not uninstalled properly, you might be leaving files on the hard drive and
unnecessary settings in the registry. Although this might not cause any problems, it depletes
available hard drive space, consumes system resources, and slows the speed at which the
registry is read. Figure 5-31 shows the Add or Remove Programs applet to use to uninstall
programs that you no longer need. The wizard will guide you through the software removal
process and remove every file that was installed.

Describe Upgrading an Operating System
Sometimes it can be necessary to upgrade an operating system. Before upgrading the oper-
ating system, check the minimum requirements of the new operating system to ensure that
the computer meets the minimum specifications required. Check the HCL to ensure that the
hardware is compatible with the new operating system. Back up all data before upgrading
the operating system in case there is a problem with the installation.
The process of upgrading a computer system from Windows 2000 to Windows XP is quick-
er than performing a new installation of Windows XP. The Windows XP setup utility
replaces the existing Windows 2000 files with Windows XP files during the upgrade
process. However, the existing applications and settings will be saved.
Table 5-6 shows the possible upgrades for Windows 98, NT, and 2000.

Identify and Apply Common Preventive
Maintenance Techniques for Operating
Systems
Preventive maintenance for an operating system includes organizing the system, defrag-
menting the hard drive, keeping applications current, removing unused applications, and
checking the system for errors.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Create a preventive maintenance plan
■Schedule a task
■Back up the hard drive
Create a Preventive Maintenance Plan
The goal of an operating system preventive maintenance plan is to avoid problems in the
future. You should perform preventive maintenance regularly, and you should also record all
actions taken and observations made. Some preventive maintenance should take place when
it will cause the least amount of disruption to the people who use the computers. This often
means scheduling tasks at night, early in the morning, or over the weekend. There are also
tools and techniques that can automate many preventive maintenance tasks.
Preventive maintenance plans should include detailed information about the maintenance of
all computers and network equipment, with emphasis on equipment that could impact the
organization the most. Preventive maintenance includes the following important tasks:
■Updates to the operating system and applications
■Updates to antivirus and other protective software
Chapter 5: Fundamental Operating Systems
155

■Hard drive error checking
■Hard drive backup
■Hard drive defragmentation
A preventive maintenance program that is designed to fix things before they break, and to
solve small problems before they affect productivity, can provide the following benefits to
users and organizations:
■Decreased downtime
■Improved performance
■Improved reliability
■Decreased repair costs
An additional part of preventive maintenance is documentation. A repair log will help you
to figure out which equipment is the most or least reliable. It will also provide a history of
when a computer was last fixed, how it was fixed, and what the problem was. 
Schedule a Task
Some preventive maintenance consists of cleaning, inspecting, and doing minor repairs.
Some preventive maintenance uses application tools that are either already in the operating
system or can be loaded onto the user’s hard drive. Most preventive maintenance applica-
tions can be set to run automatically according to a schedule.
Windows has the following utilities that will launch tasks when you schedule them:
■The DOS AT command launches tasks at a specified time using the command-line
interface. To learn more about what the AT command can do, access the command line
(choose Start > Run > cmd) and type AT /?.
■The Windows Task Scheduler launches tasks at a specified time using a graphical user
interface. To access the Windows Task Scheduler, follow this path: Start > All
Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Scheduled Tasks.
Both of these tools allow users to set commands to run at a certain time just once, or to
repeat at selected days or times. The Windows Task Scheduler, shown in Figure 5-32, is
easier to learn and use than the AT command, especially when it comes to recurring tasks
and deleting tasks already scheduled.
156
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide

Figure 5-32
Windows Task Scheduler
Chapter 5: Fundamental Operating Systems
157
System Utilities
There are several utilities included with DOS and Windows that help maintain system
integrity. Two system utilities that are useful tools for preventive maintenance are
■ScanDisk or CHKDSK: ScanDisk (Windows 2000) and CHKDSK (Windows XP)
check the integrity of files and folders and scan the hard disk surface for physical
errors. Consider using them at least once a month and also whenever a sudden loss of
power causes the system to shut down.
■Defrag: As files increase in size, some data is written to the next available space on the
disk. In time, data becomes fragmented, or spread all over the hard drive. It takes time
to seek each section of the data. Defrag gathers the noncontiguous data into one place,
making files run faster.
You can access both of these utilities by using this path:
Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Disk Defragmenter
Automatic Updates
If every maintenance task had to be scheduled every time it was run, repairing computers
would be much harder than it is today. Fortunately, tools such as the Scheduled Task Wizard
allow many functions to be automated. But how can you automate the update of software
that has not been written?
Operating systems and applications are constantly being updated for security purposes and
for added functionality. It is important that Microsoft and others provide an Automatic
Updates service, as shown in Figure 5-33. The update service can scan the system for need-
ed updates and then recommend what should be downloaded and installed. The update serv-
ice can download and install updates as soon as they are available, or it can download

updates as required and install them when the computer is next rebooted. The Microsoft
Update Wizard is available at this path:
Start > Control Panel > System > Automatic Updates
Figure 5-33
Automatic Updates
158
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide
Most antivirus software contains its own update facility. It can update both its application
software and its database files automatically. This feature allows it to provide immediate
protection as new threats develop.
Restore Point
An update can sometimes cause serious problems. Perhaps an older program is in the sys-
tem that is not compatible with the current operating system. An automatic update can
install code that will work for most users but does not work with your system.
Windows System Restore, shown in Figure 5-34, is the solution for this problem. Windows
XP can create an image of current computer settings, called a restore point. Then, if the
computer crashes or an update causes system problems, the computer can roll back to a pre-
vious configuration. 
A technician should always create a restore point before updating or replacing the operating
system. To restore or create a restore point, use the following path:
Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > System Restore
Restore points should also be created at the following times:
■When an application is installed
■When a driver is installed

Figure 5-34
Windows System Restore
Chapter 5: Fundamental Operating Systems
159
Note
A restore point backs up drivers, system files, and registry settings but not application data.
ERD and ASR
Windows 2000 offers the ability to create an emergency repair disk (ERD) that saves criti-
cal boot files and configuration information necessary to troubleshoot problems in
Windows. Windows XP offers the same features with the Automated System Recovery
(ASR) wizard. Although both ERD and ASR are powerful troubleshooting tools, they
should never replace a good backup.
A recovery CD contains the essential files used to repair the system after a serious issue,
such as a hard drive crash. The recovery CD can contain the original version of Windows,
hardware drivers, and application software. When the recovery CD is used, the computer
will be restored to the original default configuration.
Lab 5.6.2: Restore Points
In this lab, you will create a restore point and return your computer to that point in time.
Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third
Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can perform this lab now or wait until the end of the
chapter.

Back Up the Hard Drive
Just as the system restore points allow the restoration of OS configuration files, backup
tools allow the recovery of data. You can use the Microsoft Backup Tool, shown in Figure
5-35, to perform backups as required. It is important to establish a backup strategy that
includes data recovery. The organization’s requirements will determine how often the data
must be backed up and the type of backup to perform.
Figure 5-35
Microsoft Backup Utility
160
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Companion Guide
It can take a long time to run a backup. If the backup strategy is followed carefully, it will
not be necessary to back up every file at every backup. It is only necessary to make copies
of the files that have changed since the last backup. For this reason, there are several differ-
ent types of backup.
Normal Backup
A normal backup is also called a full backup. During a normal backup, all selected files on
the disk are archived to the backup medium. These files are marked as having been
archived by clearing the archive bit.
Copy Backup
A copy backup will copy all selected files. It does not mark the files as having been
archived.
Incremental Backup
An incremental backup procedure backs up all the files and folders that have been created
or modified since either the last normal or incremental backup. It marks the files as having
been archived by clearing the archive bit. This has the effect of advancing the starting point

of differential backups without having to rearchive the entire contents of the drive. If you
have to perform a system restore, you would have to first restore the last full backup, then
restore every incremental backup in order, and then restore any differential backups made
since the last incremental backup.
Differential Backup
A differential backup backs up all the files and folders that have been created or modified
since either the last normal backup or the last incremental backup. The differential backup
does not mark the files as having been archived. Copies will be made from the same start-
ing point until the next incremental or full backup is performed. Making differential back-
ups is important because only the last full and differential backups are needed to restore all
the data.
Daily Backup
Daily backups only back up the files that are modified on the day of the backup. Daily
backups do not modify the archive bit.
To access the daily backup utility on a Windows XP Professional system, use the following
path:
Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Backup
Backup Media
There are many types of backup media available for computers:
■Tape drives are devices that are used for data backup on a network server drive. Tapes
drives are an inexpensive way to store a lot of data.
■The Digital Audio Tape (DAT) tape standard uses 4-mm digital audiotapes to store data
in the Digital Data Storage (DSS) format.
■Digital Linear Tape (DLT) technology offers high-capacity and relatively high-speed
tape backup capabilities.
■USB flash memory can hold hundreds of times the data that a floppy disk can hold.
USB flash memory devices are available in many capacities and offer better transfer
rates than tape devices.

■Identify common problems and solutions
Review the Troubleshooting Process
Operating system problems can result from a combination of hardware, application, and
configuration issues. Computer technicians must be able to analyze the problem and deter-
mine the cause of the error to repair the operating system. This process is called trou-
bleshooting.
Step 1: Gathering Data from the Customer
The first step in the troubleshooting process is to gather data from the customer. This can be
done by asking the customer some open-ended and closed-ended questions. Table 5-7 pro-
vides a list open-ended and closed-ended questions to ask the customer about operating sys-
tem problems. (This list is not comprehensive.)

One of the original laptops was the GRiD Compass 1101. Astronauts used it during space
missions in the early 1980s. It weighed 11 lb. (5 kg) and cost $8,000–$10,000! Laptops
today often weigh less than one-half the weight and cost less than one-third the price of the
GRiD Compass 1101. The compact design, convenience, and evolving technology of lap-
tops have made them as popular as desktops.
Laptops, personal digital assistants (PDA), and smartphones are becoming more popular
as their prices decrease and technology continues to progress. As a computer technician,
you need to have knowledge of portable devices of all kinds. This chapter focuses on the
differences between laptops and desktops and describes the features of PDAs and smart-
phones.
Describe Laptops and Other Portable Devices
Early laptops were heavy and expensive. Today, laptops are very popular because advances
in technology have resulted in laptops that cost less, weigh less, and have improved capabil-
ities. Many laptops can be configured with an additional video port, a FireWire port, an
infrared port, or an integrated camera.
Note
Notebooks, laptops, and tablets are types of portable computers. For clarity and consistency in IT
Essentials I, all portable computers will be called laptops.
PDAs and smartphones are examples of portable, handheld devices that are becoming more
popular. PDAs offer features such as games, web surfing, e-mail, instant messaging, and
many other features offered by PCs. Smartphones are cell phones with many built-in PDA
capabilities. PDAs and smartphones can run some of the same software as laptops.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Identify some common uses of laptops 
■Identify some common uses of PDAs and smartphones
Identify Common Uses of Laptops
The most significant feature of a laptop is the compact size. The design of the laptop places
the keyboard, screen, and internal components into a small, portable case.
Another popular feature of the laptop is that it can be used almost anywhere. A recharge-
able battery allows the laptop to function when it is disconnected from an AC power source.
The first laptops were used primarily by businesspeople who needed to access and enter
data when they were away from the office. The use of laptops was limited because of
expense, weight, and limited capabilities compared to less expensive desktops.
Chapter 6: Fundamental Laptops and Portable Devices

Today laptops have lower prices and increased capabilities. A laptop is now a real alterna-
tive to a desktop computer.
Common uses for the laptop include the following:
■Taking notes in school or researching papers
■Presenting information in business meetings
■Accessing data away from home or the office
■Playing games or watching movies while traveling
■Accessing the Internet in a public place
■Sending and receiving e-mail in a public place
Identify Common Uses of PDAs and Smartphones
The concept of the PDA has existed since the 1970s. The earliest models were computer-
ized personal organizers designed to have a touch screen and a stylus. Today, some models
have both a touch screen and a keyboard and use an operating system that is similar to
operating systems used on desktop computers.
The PDA is an electronic personal organizer with the following tools:
■Address book
■Calculator
■Alarm clock
■Internet access
■E-mail
■Global positioning
The smartphone is a mobile phone with PDA capabilities. Smartphones combine cell phone
and computer functions in a single, handheld device. The technology of the PDA and the
technology of the smartphone continue to merge.
Smartphones can include these additional options:
■Built-in camera
■Document access
■E-mail
■Abbreviated note taking
■Television

■Describe the components found on the outside of the laptop
■Describe the components found on the inside of the laptop
■Describe the components found on the laptop docking station
Describe the Components Found on the Outside of the
Laptop
Laptop and desktop computers use the same types of ports so that peripherals can be inter-
changeable. These ports are specifically designed for connecting peripherals and providing
network connectivity and audio access.
Ports, connections, and drives are located on the front, back, and sides of the laptop because
of the compact design. Laptops contain PC Card or ExpressCard slots to add functionality

such as more memory, a modem, or a network connection. You learn more about PC Card
and ExpressCard slots in the section “Compare and Contrast Laptop and Desktop
Expansion Capabilities,” later in this chapter.
Laptops require a port for external power. Laptops can operate using either a battery or an
AC power adapter. This port can be used to power the computer or to charge the battery.
The exterior of the laptop also has status indicators (also called light-emitting diode [LED]
displays), ports, slots, connectors, bays, jacks, vents, and a keyhole.
Note
Exterior components and LED displays vary among different laptops. Technicians should consult the
laptop manual for a list of specific components and status displays.

A laptop monitor is a built-in liquid crystal display (LCD). It is similar to a desktop LCD
monitor, except that the resolution, brightness, and contrast settings can be adjusted using
software or button controls. The laptop monitor cannot be adjusted for height and distance
because it is integrated into the lid of the case.
A desktop monitor can be connected to a laptop. Using the function key, you can toggle the
screen from the laptop to the desktop monitor or view both at the same time. These key
combinations vary from laptop to laptop. Refer to the user manual for directions.
Virtual Laptop Activity: Keyboard
Explore the Virtual Laptop keyboard. Refer to the Virtual Laptop software on the CD that
accompanies this book.
Describe the Components Found on the Laptop
Docking Station
A base station is a device that attaches to AC power and to desktop peripherals. When you
plug the laptop into the base station, you have convenient access to power and the attached
peripherals.
There are two types of base stations: docking stations and port replicators. Docking sta-
tions and port replicators are used for the same purpose. Port replicators are usually smaller
than docking stations and do not have speakers or Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association (PCMCIA) slots.

The following are three typical areas on top of the docking station, as shown in Figure 6-9:
■Power button
■Eject button
■Laptop connector

Laptop software on the CD that accompanies this book. 

Compare and Contrast Desktop and Laptop
Components
Most of the functions that a desktop can perform can also be performed by a laptop.
However, these two kinds of computers are built very differently and the parts are not inter-
changeable. As an example, a airplane and a helicopter can each travel to the same destina-
tion, but they cannot be repaired with the same spare parts. This is also true for laptops and
desktops. Few components can be shared between desktops and laptops.
Desktop components tend to be standardized. They usually meet universal form factors,
meaning that desktops made by different manufacturers can often use the same components.
A common desktop form factor is Advanced Technology Extended (ATX). When purchas-
ing upgrade parts for this form factor, you will look for ATX motherboards and ATX power
supplies. This standard should guarantee that the motherboard and power supply will work
in the ATX case. A DVD/CD-RW drive is another example of a desktop component that has
a standard form factor.
Laptop components are much more specialized than desktop components. This is because
laptop manufacturers focus on refining laptop components to make them more efficient and
compact. As a result, manufacturers design laptop components to follow their own specific
form factors. Laptop components are proprietary, so you might not be able to use compo-
nents made by one laptop manufacturer to repair a laptop made by another manufacturer.
Note
Technicians might have to obtain certification for each laptop manufacturer they support.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Compare and contrast desktop and laptop motherboards
■Compare and contrast desktop and laptop processors
■Compare and contrast desktop and laptop power management
■Compare and contrast desktop and laptop expansion capabilities
Compare and Contrast Desktop and Laptop
Motherboards
Desktop motherboards have standard form factors. The standard size and shape allow moth-
erboards from different manufacturers to be interchangeable.
Laptop motherboards vary by manufacturer and are proprietary. When you repair a laptop,
it is strongly recommended that you obtain a replacement motherboard from the manufac-
turer of the laptop. Figure 6-12 shows a desktop motherboard and a laptop motherboard.

Laptop Motherboard
Desktop Motherboard
Laptop motherboards and desktop motherboards are designed differently. Components
designed for a laptop generally cannot be used in a desktop.
Compare and Contrast Desktop and Laptop
Processors
The central processing unit (CPU), or processor, is the brain of the computer. The CPU
interprets and processes instructions that are used to manipulate data.
Laptop processors are designed to use less power and create less heat than desktop proces-
sors. As a result, laptop processors do not require cooling devices that are as large as those
found in desktops. Laptop processors also use CPU throttling to modify the clock speed as
needed to reduce power consumption and heat. This results in a slight decrease in perform-
ance. It also increases the life span of some components. These specially designed proces-
sors allow a laptop to operate for a longer period of time when using a battery power
source.
Note
Technicians should refer to the laptop manual for processors that can be used as replacement proces-
sors and for processor replacement instructions.
Compare and Contrast Desktop and Laptop Power
Management
Power management controls the flow of electricity to the components of a computer.
Desktops are usually set up in a location where they remain plugged into a power source.
Desktop power management distributes electricity from the source to the components of the
desktop. There is also a small battery in the desktop that provides electricity to maintain the
internal clock and BIOS settings when the desktop is powered off.

Laptops are small and portable. This portability feature is achieved by combining the small
size and weight of a laptop with the ability to operate from a battery. When the laptop is
plugged in, laptop power management sends electricity from the AC power source to the
laptop components. The laptop power management also recharges the battery. When the
laptop is unplugged, laptop power management takes electricity from the battery and sends
it to the laptop components.
There are two methods of power management:
■Advanced Power Management (APM): APM is an earlier version of power manage-
ment. With APM, the BIOS was used to control the settings for power management.
■Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI): ACPI has replaced APM. ACPI
offers additional power management features. With ACPI, the operating system con-
trols power management.
You learn more about APM and ACPI in the section “Describe How to Configure Power
Settings,” later in this chapter.
Compare and Contrast Desktop and Laptop Expansion
Capabilities
Expansion capabilities add functionality to a computer. Many expansion devices can be
used with both laptops and desktops:
■External drives
■Modems
■Network cards
■Wireless adapters
■Printers
■Other peripherals
Expansion devices are attached to laptops and desktops differently. A desktop attaches these
devices with USB ports and parallel ports. A laptop attaches these devices with USB ports,
parallel ports, and PC Cards.
The standardized use of USB and FireWire ports makes it possible to connect many types
of external components to laptops, docking stations, port replicators, and desktops. The
USB and FireWire standards make it possible to connect and remove external components
without the need to power off the system. USB and FireWire ports are used to connect a
range of external components:
■Printers
■Scanners
16
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Floppy disk drives
■Mice
■Cameras
■Keyboards
■Hard drives
■Flash drives
■Optical drives
■MP3 players
Laptops and desktops have similar expansion capabilities. The difference in form factor
between the computers determines which type of expansion device is used. Desktops have
internal bays that support 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch drives. Additionally, there is space to
install other permanent expansion drives. Laptops have limited space, so the expansion bays
on laptops are designed to allow different types of drives to fit into the same bay. Drives are
hot swappable and are inserted or removed as needed.

Laptops use the PC Card slot to add functionality. The PC Card slot uses an open standard
interface to connect to peripheral devices using the CardBus standard. Examples of devices
that connect using PC Cards include the following:
■Memory
■Modems
■Hard drives
■Network cards
PC Cards follow the PCMCIA standard. They come in three types: Type I, Type II, and
Type III. Each type of PC Card is different in size and can attach to different devices. A
newer type of PC Card is called the PC ExpressCard.

Explain How to Configure Laptops
To allow applications and processes to run smoothly, you might need to configure and allo-
cate system resources, install additional components and plug-ins, or change environmental
settings to match software requirements. Adding external components is usually accom-
plished through the use of Plug and Play, but occasionally driver installation and additional
configuration might be required. Proper configuration of the power settings will help you

get the maximum performance from a laptop, such as increasing the length of time the lap-
top can be used on battery power.
With laptops, you might need to exchange components occasionally to accomplish different
tasks and respond to changing situations. You can customize a laptop for specific purposes
by adding external components. For example, you can install a second hard drive in a laptop
to provide additional storage capacity. Components need to be carefully inserted or connect-
ed to bays, connectors, and proprietary expansion areas to avoid damage to the equipment.
It is important to follow safe removal procedures when disconnecting hot-swappable and
non-hot-swappable devices.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe how to configure power settings
■Describe the safe installation and removal of laptop components
Describe How to Configure Power Settings
One of the most popular features of a laptop is the ability to operate using batteries. This
feature allows laptops to operate in locations where AC power is not available or is incon-
venient. Advances in power management and battery technology are increasing the time
laptop users can remain disconnected from AC power. Current batteries can last from 2 to
10 hours without recharging. Managing the power by configuring the power settings on a
laptop is important to ensure that the battery charge is used efficiently.
The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) standards create a bridge between
the hardware and OS and allow technicians to create power management schemes to get the
best performance from the computer. The ACPI standards can be applicable to most com-
puters, but they are particularly important when managing power in laptops. Table 6-5
shows information about each power state.
Table 6-5
Power Management States
ACPI Standard
Power Management State
S0
The computer is on and the CPU is running.
S1
The CPU is not running. However, the CPU and RAM are still receiving
power.
S2
The CPU is off, but the RAM is refreshed. The system is in a lower
power mode than S1.
S3
The CPU is off, and the RAM is set to slow refresh rate. This mode is
often called “Save to RAM.” In Windows XP, this state is known as the
Standby mode.
20
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

S4
The CPU and RAM are off. The contents of RAM have been saved to a
temporary file on the hard disk. This mode is also called “Saved to
Disk.” In Windows XP, this state is known as the Hibernate mode.
S5
The computer is off and nothing has been saved.
Technicians frequently are required to configure power settings by changing the settings
found in BIOS. Configuring power settings in BIOS affects the following conditions:
■System states
■Battery and AC modes
■Thermal management
■CPU PCI bus power management
Figure 6-14 shows an example of power settings in BIOS.

ACPI Standard
Power Management State
Note
When working in Windows XP, the ACPI power management mode must be enabled in BIOS to
allow the OS to configure all the power management states. There is no standard name for each
power management state. Manufacturers can use different names for the same state.

Here are the steps to check the ACPI settings in the BIOS:
Step 1.
Enter BIOS setup by pressing the appropriate key or key combination while the
computer is booting. Typically this is the Delete key or the F2 key, but there are
several other options.
Step 2.
Locate and enter the Power Management Settings menu item.
Step 3.
Use the appropriate keys to enable ACPI mode.
Step 4.
Save and exit BIOS setup. 
Note
These steps are common to most laptops and should be used only as a guideline. Be sure to check
your laptop manual for specific configuration settings.
The power options in Windows XP allow you to reduce the power consumption of a num-
ber of devices or of the entire system. Power options allow you to control the power man-
agement features of the following:
■Hard drive
■Display
■Shut Down, Hibernate, and Standby modes
■Low-battery warnings
Configuring Power Settings in Windows XP
You can adjust power management by using Power Options windows in the Control Panel.
The Power Options in the Control Panel display the only options that can be controlled.
Note
Power Options will automatically detect devices that might be unique to your computer. Therefore,
the Power Options windows can vary by the hardware that is detected.
To configure your power settings, choose Start > Control Panel > Power Options.
Configuring Power Schemes
Power schemes are a collection of settings that manage the power usage of the computer.
Both the hard drive and the display consume large amounts of power. They can be config-
ured on the Power Schemes tab.
When you open Power Options, you will notice that Windows XP has preset power
schemes. These are the default settings and were created when Windows XP was installed.
You can use the default power schemes or create customized schemes that are based on spe-
cific work requirements. Figure 6-15 shows the default power scheme set for a laptop.

Customizing the Display and Hard Drive Power Settings
You can customize the display and hard drive power settings depending on your require-
ments and save the power scheme with a customized name. For example, a student uses a
laptop for research on the Internet but does not create or save files often. In this scenario,
the student needs access to the display, but rarely accesses the hard drive. The student cus-
tomizes the settings as shown in Figure 6-16 and saves the settings as Research.
Figure 6-16
Power Scheme: Research Settings

Power Management for the Hard Drive
One of the biggest power consumers on a laptop is the hard drive. In this scenario, the hard
drive is not accessed often. The Turn off hard disks time is set for 1 hour when the laptop
is plugged in and 3 minutes when the laptop is running on batteries.
The student decides that the default settings for the Standby and Hibernate modes are
acceptable and no changes are made. 
Setting the Laptop to the Standby or Hibernate Sleep State
If you do not want to completely shut down the laptop, you have two options:
■Standby: Documents and applications are saved in RAM, allowing the computer to
power on quickly.
■Hibernate: Documents and applications are saved to a temporary file on the hard drive,
and it will take a little longer than Standby to power on.
Figure 6-17 shows Hibernate enabled in the Power Options properties.

Adjusting Low Battery Warnings 
In Windows XP, you can set the low battery warnings. There are two levels: Low Battery
Alarm and Critical Battery Alarm. The low battery alarm will warn you that the battery is
low. The critical battery alarm will initiate a forced standby, hibernate, or shutdown, as
shown in Figure 6-18.

Compare the Different Mobile Phone Standards
When people began to use cell phones, there were few industry-wide standards applying to
cell phone technology. Without standards, it was difficult and expensive to make calls to
people that were on another network. Today, cell phone providers use industry standards,
which make it easier to use cell phones to make calls.
When the industry started, most cell phone standards were analog. Today, cell phone stan-
dards are mostly digital.
Note
Cell phone standards have not been adopted uniformly around the world. Some cell phones are capa-
ble of using multiple standards while others can use only one standard. As a result, some cell phones
can operate in many countries while other cell phones can only be used locally.

The first generation (1G) of cell phones began service in the 1980s. First-generation phones
primarily used analog standards, including Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) and
Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT).
In an analog system, the voice information is sent by varying the radio signals used by the
phone in the same pattern as the speakers’ voices. Unfortunately, this means that interfer-
ence and noise, which also vary the signal, cannot easily be separated from the voice in the
signal. This limits the usefulness of analog systems.
Digital signals convert the speakers’ voices into a digital signal that uses a chain of 1s and
0s. This degrades the signal a little, because 1s and 0s are not a faithful representation of
your voice. However, the digital signal is robust. It can be fixed using error correction rou-
tines if there is interference. Also, digital signals can be compressed, making the systems
much more efficient than analog systems.
In the 1990s, the second generation (2G) of cell phones was marked by a switch from ana-
log to digital standards. Second-generation cell standards included Global System for
Mobile (GSM), Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN), and Code Division Multiple
Access (CDMA).
Third-generation (3G) standards enable cell phones to go beyond simple voice and data
communications. It is now common for cell phones to send and receive text, photos, and
video. It is also common for 3G cell phones to access the Internet and to use the Global
Positioning System (GPS).
Note
As 3G cell phone standards were being developed, extensions to the existing 2G standards were
added. These transitional standards are known as 2.5G standards.
Fourth-generation (4G) standards have been championed by many users because of the
availability of increased data rates. Higher data rates will allow users to download files,
such as video and music, faster than what was available with standards of previous genera-
tions.

Identify Common Preventive Maintenance
Techniques for Laptops and Portable Devices
Because laptops are mobile, they are used in different types of environments. Some envi-
ronments can be hazardous to a laptop. Even eating or drinking around a laptop creates a
potentially hazardous condition.
Consider what would happen if a drink were spilled onto the keyboard of a laptop. Many
components are placed in a very small area directly beneath the keyboard. Spilling liquid or
dropping debris onto the keyboard can result in severe internal damage.
It is important to keep a laptop clean and to ensure that it is being used in the most optimal
environment. The following sections cover preventive maintenance techniques for the laptop.
After completing these sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Identify appropriate cleaning procedures
■Identify optimal operating environments
Identify Appropriate Cleaning Procedures
Proper routine cleaning is the easiest, least expensive way to protect and to extend the life
of a laptop. It is very important to use the right products and procedures when cleaning a
laptop. Always read all warning labels on the cleaning products. The components are very
sensitive and should be handled with care. Consult the laptop manual for additional infor-
mation and cleaning suggestions. This section provides basic steps for cleaning the laptop
keyboard, ventilation area, screen, touchpad, disk drives, and discs.
To clean a laptop keyboard, perform the following procedures:
Step 1.

To clean a floppy drive, use a commercially available cleaning kit. Floppy drive cleaning
kits include pretreated floppy disks that remove contaminants from the floppy drive heads
that have accumulated through normal operation. To clean the drive, follow these steps:
Step 1.
Remove all media from the floppy drive.
Step 2.
Insert the cleaning disk and let it spin for the suggested amount of time. 
Dirt, dust, and other contaminants can collect in your optical drives and on the discs.
Contaminated drives and discs can cause malfunctions, missing data, error messages and
lost productivity. To clean an optical disc, use a commercially available CD or DVD drive
cleaning disc. Many floppy disk cleaning kits include an optical disc cleaner. Like the flop-
py disk cleaner, optical disc cleaner kits contain a cleaning solution and a nonabrasive disc
that is inserted into the optical drive. Perform the following cleaning procedures:
Step 1.
Remove all media from the optical drive.
Step 2.
Insert the cleaning disc and let it spin for the suggested amount of time to clean
all contact areas.
For a CD or DVD disc, inspect the disc for scratches. Replace discs that contain deep
scratches because they can cause data errors. If you notice problems such as skipping or
degraded playback quality with your CDs or DVDs, clean the discs. Commercial products
are available that clean discs and provide protection from dust, fingerprints, and scratches.
Cleaning products for CDs are safe to use on DVDs. To clean the disc, follow these steps:
Step 1.
Hold the disc by its outer edge or by the inside edge of the center hole.
Step 2.
Gently wipe the disc with a lint-free cotton cloth. Never use paper or any materi-
al that can scratch the disc or leave streaks.
Step 3.
Wipe from the center of the disc outward. Never use a circular motion.
Step 4.
Apply a commercial CD or DVD cleaning solution to the lint-free cotton cloth,
and wipe again if any contaminates remain on the disc.
Step 5.
Allow the disc to dry before it is inserted into the drive. 
Identify Optimal Operating Environments
An optimal operating environment for a laptop is clean, free of potential contaminants, and
within the temperature and humidity range specified by the manufacturer. With most desk-
top computers, the operating environment can be controlled. However, because of the
portable nature of laptops, it is not always possible to control the temperature, humidity,
and working conditions. Laptops are built to resist adverse environments, but technicians
should always take precautions to protect the equipment from damage and loss of data.
It is important to transport or ship laptops carefully. Use a padded laptop case to store your
laptop. When you carry it, use an approved computer bag. If the laptop is shipped, use

Shipping and Transporting a Laptop
Chapter 6: Fundamental Laptops and Portable Devices
33
Laptops are transported to many types of environments. Dust particles, temperature, and
humidity can affect the performance of a laptop. Follow these guidelines to help ensure
optimal operating performance from your laptop:
■Clean the laptop frequently to remove dust and potential contaminants.
■Do not obstruct vents or airflow to internal components. A laptop can overheat if air
circulation is obstructed.
■Keep the room temperature between 45 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (7 and 32 degrees
Celsius).
■Keep the humidity level between 10 and 80 percent.
Temperature and humidity recommendations will vary by laptop manufacturer. You should
research these recommended values, especially if you plan to use the laptop in extreme con-
ditions. 
Describe How to Troubleshoot Laptops and
Portable Devices
When troubleshooting problems with laptops or portable devices, you should determine
whether a repair is cost effective. To determine the best course of action, you should com-
pare the cost of the repair to the replacement cost of the laptop or portable device, less the
salvage value.

Because many portable devices change rapidly in design and functionality, portable devices
are often more expensive to repair than to replace. For this reason, portable devices are usu-
ally replaced while laptops can be replaced or repaired.
Follow the steps outlined in the following sections to accurately identify, repair, and docu-
ment the problem. The troubleshooting process follows:
Step 1.
Gather data from the customer.
Step 2.
Verify the obvious issues.
Step 3.
Try quick solutions first.
Step 4.
Gather data from the computer.
Step 5.
Evaluate the problem and implement the solution.
Step 6.
Close with the customer.
After completing these sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Review the troubleshooting process
■Identify common problems and solutions
Review the Troubleshooting Process
The first step in the troubleshooting process is to gather data as follows from the customer.
There are two types of questions you can ask: open-ended and closed-ended.
Open-ended questions cannot be answered with yes or no answers. The purpose of open-
ended questions is to allow the customer to describe the problem.
Closed-ended questions can usually be answered with yes or no answers. This type of ques-
tion can help a technician focus in on an error and locate the exact problem when a poten-
tial solution is being tested.
After you have talked to the customer, you should verify the obvious issues. Examine the
most obvious causes of a problem as follows:
■Battery
■LEDs
■Function keys
■Cable connections
After the obvious issues have been verified, try some quick solutions such as
■Reboot the laptop.
■Check the BIOS settings.

Summary
This chapter discussed the features of laptops, portable devices (PDAs), and smartphones.
The following are some of the important concepts to remember from this chapter:
■Laptops, PDAs, and smartphones are becoming increasingly popular because of
reduced costs, lighter weights, increased capabilities, and battery power for portability.
■Laptops and desktops have ports that are virtually the same, so peripherals are inter-
changeable. Laptops can use docking stations or port replicators to quickly connect to
desktop peripherals and AC power.
■The laptop CPU is designed to use less power and create less heat than the desktop
computer. It uses CPU throttling to reduce power consumption and heat.
■Functionality of the laptop can be expanded by adding components through PC Card or
ExpressCard slots and USB, FireWire, and parallel ports.
■Cell phone standards were developed in the 1980s. The current third-generation stan-
dards enable cell phones to share some laptop functions, such as e-mail, Internet
access, and calendar and address functions. Standards have not been adopted world-
wide.
■Preventive maintenance will ensure optimal operation of the laptop. It is important to
keep the laptop clean and in safe environments. It is critical to use the correct materials
and techniques when cleaning the various components of a laptop. Procedures for
cleaning the components are presented.
■Dust, temperature, and humidity can affect laptop performance. Basic guidelines are to
keep the laptop clean, with good ventilation and room temperature at 45 to 90 degrees
F (7 to 32 degrees C) and humidity levels in the range of 10 to 80 percent.
■Troubleshooting laptop problems requires the technician to identify, repair, and docu-
ment the problem. Troubleshooting steps include gathering data from the customer,
verifying the obvious, trying quick solutions first, gathering data from the computer,
evaluating the problem, implementing the solution, and closing with the customer.
Chapter 13, “Advanced Laptops and Portable Devices,” focuses on troubleshooting more
difficult problems.

This chapter provides essential information about printers and scanners. You will learn how
printers operate, what to consider when purchasing a printer, and how to connect printers to
an individual computer or to a network.
Printers produce paper copies of electronic files. Scanners allow users to convert paper
documents into electronic files. Many government regulations require physical records;
therefore, hard copies of computer documents are often as important today as they were
when the paperless revolution began several years ago.
You must understand the operation of various types of printers and scanners to be able to
install and maintain them, as well as to troubleshoot any problems that may arise.
Describe the Types of Printers Currently
Available
As a computer technician, you might be required to purchase, repair, or maintain a printer.
The customer might request that you perform the following tasks:
■Select a printer
■Install and configure a printer
■Troubleshoot a printer
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe characteristics and capabilities of printers.
■Describe printer-to-computer interfaces.
■Describe laser printers.
■Describe impact printers.
■Describe inkjet printers.
■Describe solid-ink printers.
■Describe other printer types.
Describe Characteristics and Capabilities of Printers
Printers available today are usually either laser printers using electrophotographic technol-
ogy or inkjet printers using electrostatic spray technology. Dot-matrix printers using
impact technology are used in applications that require carbon copies. When selecting a
printer, consider the following criteria:
■Capacity
■Speed
■Color
■Quality
Chapter 7: Fundamental Printers and Scanners
3

■Reliability
■Cost
Capacity and Speed
Printer capacity and speed are factors to consider when selecting a printer. Inkjet printers
are usually slower, but they might be adequate for a home or small office. A printer’s speed
is measured in pages per minute (ppm). The speed of an inkjet printer is 2 to 6 ppm. The
speed of a laser printer is 8 to 200 ppm.
Color or Black and White
A computer monitor produces colors through the additive mixing of dots that are displayed
on the screen. The eye picks up the colors directly. The dots produce the color range using
red, green, and blue (RGB) dots.
A printer produces colors using subtractive mixing. The eye sees a color that reflects from
the combination of colors on the paper.
The choice between a black-and-white printer and a color printer depends on your cus-
tomer’s needs. If your customer is primarily printing letters and does not need color capa-
bility, a black-and-white printer is sufficient. However, an elementary school teacher might
need a color printer to add excitement to lessons.
Quality
The quality of printing is measured in dots per inch (dpi). The more dpi, the higher the res-
olution. When the resolution is higher, text and images are usually clearer. To produce the
best high-resolution images, you should use both high-quality ink or toner and high-quality
paper.
Reliability
A printer should be reliable. Because there are so many types of printers on the market, you
should research the specifications of several printers before selecting one. Here are some of
the options available from the manufacturer:
■Warranty: Identify what is covered in the warranty.
■Scheduled servicing: Servicing is based on expected usage. Information is found in
the manual or on the manufacturer’s website.
■Mean time between failures (MTBF): The average length of time that the printer will
work without failing. You typically can find this information in the manual or on the
manufacturer’s website.

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Total Cost of Ownership
Consider the cost when selecting hardware. When buying a printer, you must consider more
than just the initial cost of the printer. The total cost of ownership (TCO) includes a number
of factors:
■Initial purchase price
■Cost of supplies, such as paper and ink/toner
■Price per page
■Maintenance costs
■Warranty costs
■Data/communication cables
■The amount of material printed
■Lifetime of the printer
Describe Printer-to-Computer Interfaces
A computer must have a compatible interface with the printer to be able to print documents.
Typically, printers connect to home computers using a parallel, USB, or wireless interface.
Corporate printers may connect to a network using a network cable.
The different types of printer ports are described in the following sections. 
Serial Ports
Serial data transfer is the movement of single bits of information in a single cycle. A serial
connection can be used for dot-matrix printers because they do not require high-speed data
transfer.
Parallel Ports
Parallel data transfer is faster than serial data transfer. Parallel data transfer is the move-
ment of multiple bits of information in a single cycle. The path is wider for information to
move to or from the printer.
IEEE 1284 is the current standard for parallel printer ports. Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP)
and Enhanced Capabilities Port (ECP) are two modes of operation within the IEEE 1284
standard that allow bidirectional communication. Figure 7-1 shows a parallel port.
Chapter 7: Fundamental Printers and Scanners

Figure 7-1
Printer Parallel, Ethernet, and Coaxial Ports
6
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
SCSI Interfaces
Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is a type of interface that uses parallel communi-
cation technology to achieve high data-transfer rates.
USB Interfaces
Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a common interface for printers and other devices. The
speed and simple setup have made USB very practical. Newer operating systems offer
“plug-and-play” USB support. When a USB device is added to a computer system support-
ing plug-and-play, the device is automatically detected and starts the driver installation
process.
USB 2.0 is the current USB standard. USB 2.0 can support up to 127 devices and has a
transfer rate of as much as 480 Mbps.
FireWire Connections
FireWire, also known as i.LINK or IEEE 1394, is a high-speed communication bus that is
platform-independent. FireWire connects digital devices such as digital printers, scanners,
digital cameras, and hard drives.
FireWire allows a peripheral device, such as a printer, to seamlessly plug into a computer. It
also allows a device such as a printer to be hot-swappable. FireWire provides a single plug-
and-socket connection that can attach up to 63 devices. FireWire has a data transfer rate of
up to 400 Mbps.

Ethernet Connections
Printers can be shared over a network. Connecting a printer to the network requires cabling
(such as Ethernet) that is compatible with both the existing network and the network port
installed in the printer. Most network printers use an RJ-45 interface to connect to a net-
work.
Wireless Connections
Wireless printing technology is available in infrared, Bluetooth, and wireless fidelity (Wi-
Fi) technology.
For infrared communication to take place between a printer and a computer, transmitters
and receivers are required on both devices. There must be a clear line of sight between the
transmitter and receiver on both devices, with a maximum distance of 12 feet (3.7 m).
Infrared uses a type of light that is invisible to the human eye. 
Bluetooth technology uses an unlicensed radio frequency for short-range communication
and is popular for wireless headsets and synching PDAs to laptops and desktop computers.
A Bluetooth adapter allows a Bluetooth device to connect to a printer, usually by using a
USB port.
Wi-Fi is the popular name for a relatively new technology that lets you connect computers
to a network without using cables. Wi-Fi technology has four common standards, all of
which begin with the number of the IEEE standard, 802.11:
■802.11a transfers data at a rate of up to 54 Mbps at 5 GHz.
■802.11b transfers data at a rate of 11 Mbps at 2.4 GHz.
■802.11g transfers data at a rate of 54 Mbps at 2.4 GHz. 802.11g products are back-
ward-compatible with 802.11b.
■802.11n is currently in the standardization process and is expected to be approved with
a maximum data transfer rate of up to 248 Mbps. 
Describe Laser Printers
A laser printer, such as the one shown in Figure 7-2, is a high-quality, fast printer that uses
a laser beam to create an image. The central part of the laser printer is its electrophoto-
graphic drum. The drum is a metal cylinder that is coated with a light-sensitive insulating
material. When a beam of laser light strikes the drum, it becomes a conductor at the point
where the light hits it. As the drum rotates, the laser beam draws an electrostatic image on
the drum, called the image. The undeveloped or latent image is passed by a supply of dry
ink or toner that is attracted to it. The drum turns and brings this image into contact with
the paper, which attracts the toner from the drum. The paper is passed through a fuser that
is made up of hot rollers, which melts the toner into the paper.
Chapter 7: Fundamental Printers and Scanners

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
The laser printer process involves six steps to print information on a single sheet of paper:
Step 1.
Cleaning: When an image has been deposited on the paper and fusion occurs,
any remaining toner must be removed from the drum. A printer may have a
blade that scrapes all excess toner from the drum. Some printers use AC voltage
on a wire that removes the charge from the drum surface and allows the excess
toner to fall away from the drum. The excess toner is stored in a used-toner con-
tainer that may be emptied or discarded.
Step 2.
Conditioning: This step involves removing the old latent image from the drum
and conditioning the drum for a new latent image. Conditioning is done by plac-
ing a special wire, grid, or roller that receives a negative charge of approximately
–600 volts DC uniformly across the surface of the drum. The charged wire or
grid is called the primary corona wire. The roller is called a conditioning roller. 
Step 3.
Writing: The writing process involves scanning the photosensitive drum with the
laser beam. Every portion of the drum that is exposed to the light has the surface
charge reduced to about –100 volts DC. This electrical charge has a lower nega-
tive charge than the remainder of the drum. As the drum turns, an invisible latent
image is created on the drum.
Step 4.
Developing: In the developing phase, the toner is applied to the latent image on
the drum. The toner is a negatively charged combination of plastic and metal
particles. A control blade holds the toner at a microscopic distance from the
drum. The toner then moves from the control blade to the more positively
charged latent image on the drum.
Step 5.
Transferring: In this step, the toner attached to the latent image is transferred to
the paper. The transfer, or secondary corona, places a positive charge on the
paper. Because the drum was charged negatively, the toner on the drum is attract-
ed to the paper. The image is now on the paper and is held in place by the posi-
tive charge.
How To

Step 6.
Fusing: In this step, the toner is permanently fused to the paper. The printing
paper is rolled between a heated roller and a pressure roller. As the paper moves
through the heated roller and the pressure roller, the loose toner is melted and
fused with the fibers in the paper. The paper is then moved to the output tray as a
printed page. 
The following mnemonic will help you memorize the order of the steps of the laser printing
process:
Continuous (cleaning)
Care (conditioning)
Will (writing)
Delay (developing)
Trouble (transferring)
Forever (fusing)
Warning
The primary corona wire or grid, or the conditioning roller, can be very dangerous. The voltage runs
as high as –6000 volts. Only certified technicians should work on the unit. Before working inside a
laser printer, you should make sure that the voltage is properly discharged.
Describe Impact Printers
Impact printers, such as the one shown in Figure 7-3, are basic. Impact printers have print
heads that strike the inked ribbon, causing characters to be printed on the paper. Daisy-
wheel and dot-matrix are examples of impact printers.
Figure 7-3
Impact Printer
Chapter 7: Fundamental Printers and Scanners
9

In a daisy-wheel printer, the wheel contains the letters, numbers, and special characters. The
wheel rotates until the required character is in place, and an electromechanical hammer
pushes the character into the ink ribbon. The character then strikes the paper, printing the
character on the paper.
A dot-matrix printer is similar to the daisy-wheel printer, except that instead of a wheel
containing characters, a print head contains pins that are surrounded by electromagnets.
When energized, the pins push forward onto the ink ribbon, creating a character on the
paper.
The number of pins on a print head, 9 or 24, indicates the quality of the print. The highest
quality of print that is produced by a dot-matrix printer is called near-letter quality (NLQ).
Table 7-1 lists some advantages and disadvantages of an impact printer. 
Table 7-1
Impact Printer Pros and Cons
Advantages
Disadvantages
Uses inexpensive consumables
Noisy
Uses continuous-feed paper
Low-resolution graphics
Has carbon copy printing capability
Limited color capability
Slow printing, normally in the range of 32 to 76
characters per second (cps)
Describe Inkjet Printers
Inkjet printers produce high-quality prints. Inkjet printers are easy to use and inexpensive
compared to laser printers. The print quality of an inkjet printer is measured in dots per inch
(dpi). Higher dpi numbers provide greater image details. Figure 7-4 shows an all-in-one
device that contains an inkjet printer. Figure 7-5 shows inkjet printer components.
Figure 7-4
Inkjet Printer
10
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Figure 7-5
Inkjet Printer Components
Chapter 7: Fundamental Printers and Scanners
11
Inkjet printers use ink-filled cartridges that spray ink onto a page through tiny holes called
nozzles. The ink is sprayed in a pattern on the page.
There are two types of inkjet nozzles:
■Thermal: A pulse of electrical current is applied to heating chambers around the noz-
zles. The heat creates a bubble of steam in the chamber. The steam forces ink out
through the nozzle and onto the paper.
■Piezoelectric: Piezoelectric crystals are located in the ink reservoir at the back of each
nozzle. A charge is applied to the crystal, causing it to vibrate. This vibration of the
crystal controls the flow of ink onto the paper.
Inkjet printers use plain paper to make economical prints. Special-purpose paper may be
used to create high-quality prints of photographs. When the inkjet print is complete and the
paper leaves the printer, the ink is often wet. You should avoid touching printouts for 10 to
15 seconds to prevent the images from smearing.
Table 7-2 lists some advantages and disadvantages of an inkjet printer.
Table 7-2
Inkjet Printer Pros and Cons
Advantages
Disadvantages
Low cost
Nozzles are prone to clogging
High resolution
Ink cartridges are expensive
Quick to warm up

Describe Solid-Ink Printers
Solid-ink printers use solid sticks of ink rather than toner or ink cartridges, as shown in
Figure 7-6. Solid-ink printers produce high-quality images. The ink sticks are nontoxic and
can be handled safely. 

Figure 7-6
Solid-Ink Printer
12
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Solid-ink printers melt ink sticks and spray the ink through nozzles. The ink is sprayed onto
a drum. The drum transfers the ink to paper.

Describe Other Printer Types
Two other printing technologies that you may work with are thermal and dye sublimation,
as described in the following sections.
Thermal Printers
Some retail cash registers or older fax machines may contain thermal printers, as shown in
Figure 7-7. The paper used in thermal printers is chemically treated and has a waxy quality.
Thermal paper becomes black when heated. Most thermal printer print heads are the width
of the paper. Areas of the print head are heated as required to make the pattern on the paper.
The paper is supplied in the form of a roll.

Table 7-4
Thermal Printer Pros and Cons
Advantages
Disadvantages
Longer life because there are few moving parts
Paper is expensive
Paper has a short shelf life
Images are poor quality
Paper must be stored at room temperature
Dye-Sublimation Printers
Dye-sublimation printers, such as the one shown in Figure 7-8, produce photo-quality
images for graphic printing. Dye-sublimation printers use solid sheets of ink that change
directly from solid to gas in a process called sublimating. The print head passes over a sheet
of cyan, magenta, yellow, and a clear overcoat (CMYO). There is a pass for each color. In
photography, both dye-sublimation printers and small color inkjet printers provide quality
prints.

(black and white)
Describe the Installation and Configuration
Process for Printers
When you purchase a printer, the installation and configuration information is usually sup-
plied by the manufacturer. An installation CD that includes drivers, manuals, and diagnostic
software is included with the printer. The same tools may also be available as downloads
from the manufacturer’s website. Figure 7-9 show an example of what typically comes with
a printer.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe how to set up a printer.
■Explain how to power and connect the device using a local or network port.
■Describe how to install and update the device driver, firmware, and RAM.
■Identify configuration options and default settings.

■Describe how to optimize printer performance.

Describe How to Set Up a Printer
Although all types of printers are somewhat different to connect and configure, some proce-
dures should be applied to all printers. After the printer has been unpacked and placed in
position, connect it to the computer, network, or print server, and plug it into an electrical
outlet.
Follow these steps to set up a printer:
Step 1.
Check the box to ensure that all required cables are provided.
Step 2.
Remove all packing materials from the printer.
Step 3.
Remove all plastic inserts from the consumables.
Step 4.
Ensure that the printer location will not cause overheating.
Step 5.
Install paper trays.
Step 6.
Install paper.
Step 7.
Read and follow the instruction manual.
How To

Explain How to Power and Connect the Device Using a
Local or Network Port
Now that the printer has been unpacked and placed in position, you must connect it to the
computer, network, or print server and plug it into an electrical outlet by following these
steps:
Step 1.
Connect the appropriate data cable to the communication port on the back of the
printer. If the printer has a USB, FireWire, or parallel port, connect the corre-
sponding cable to the printer port.
Step 2.
Connect the other end of the data cable to the corresponding port on the back of
the computer. If you are installing a network printer, connect the network cable
to the network port.
Step 3.
After the data cable has been properly connected, attach the power cable to the
printer, as shown in Figure 7-10.
Figure 7-10

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
How To
Step 4.
Connect the other end of the power cable to an available electrical outlet. 
Caution
Never plug a printer into a UPS. The power surge that occurs when the printer is turned on will dam-
age the UPS unit.
Describe How to Install and Update the Device Driver,
Firmware, and RAM
After you have connected the power and data cables to the printer, the operating system
may discover the printer and attempt to install a driver. If you have a driver disc from the

manufacturer, use this driver. The driver that is included with the printer is usually more
current than the drivers used by the operating system. Figure 7-11 shows the Add Printer
wizard, which can also be used to install the new printer.
Figure 7-11

Printer Drivers
Printer drivers are software programs that enable the computer and the printer to communi-
cate with each other. Drivers also provide an interface for the user to configure printer
options. Every printer model has a unique driver. Printer manufacturers frequently update
drivers to increase the printer’s performance, to add options, or to fix problems. You can
download new printer drivers from the manufacturer’s website. To update and test a printer
driver, follow these steps:
Step 1.
Find out if a newer driver is available. Go to the printer manufacturer’s web-
site. Most manufacturer websites have a link from the main page to a page that
offers drivers and support. Make sure that the driver is compatible with the com-
puter that you are updating.
Step 2.
Download the driver. Download the printer driver files to your computer. Most
driver files come in a compressed or “zipped” format. Download the file to a
folder, and uncompress or “unzip” the contents. Save instructions or documenta-
tion to a separate folder on your computer.
Step 3.
Install the downloaded driver. Install the downloaded driver automatically or
manually. Most printer drivers have a setup file that automatically searches the
system for older drivers and replaces them with the new one. If no setup file is
available, follow the directions supplied by the manufacturer.
Step 4.
Test the new printer driver. Run multiple tests to make sure that the printer
works properly. Use a variety of applications to print different types of docu-
ments. Change and test each printer option. 
How To

Firmware
Firmware is a set of instructions stored on the printer. The firmware controls how the print-
er operates. Figure 7-12 shows a firmware upgrade utility. The procedure to upgrade
firmware is very similar to the procedure for installing printer drivers.

Printer Memory
Adding printer memory to a printer can improve printing speed and allow the printer to
handle more complex print jobs. All printers have at least some memory. Generally, the
more memory a printer has, the more efficiently it operates. Here is a generic list of steps to
follow to upgrade printer memory:
Step 1.
Turn off the printer.
Step 2.
Disconnect all cables.
Step 3.
Open the memory compartment.
Step 4.
Replace memory modules or add new modules.
Step 5.
Close the memory compartment.
Step 6.
Reconnect all cables.
Step 7.
Power on the printer.
Step 8.
Run a self-test.
Step 9.
Print a test page.
How To

Consult the printer documentation for memory requirements:
■Memory specifications: Some printer manufacturers use standard types of memory,
and other manufacturers use proprietary memory. Check the documentation for the type
of memory, the speed of the memory, and the capacity of memory.
■Memory population and availability: Some printers have multiple memory slots. To
find out how many memory slots are used and how many are available, you may need
to open a compartment on the printer to check memory population.
Identify Configuration Options and Default Settings
Each printer may have different configurations and default options, as shown in Figure 7-13.
Check the printer documentation for information about configurations and default settings.
Figure 7-13
Printer Settings
Chapter 7: Fundamental Printers and Scanners
19
Here are some common configurations that are available for printers:
■Paper type: Standard, draft, gloss, or photo
■Print quality: Draft, normal, photo, or automatic
■Color printing: Multiple colors are used
■Black-and-white printing: Only black ink is used
■Grayscale printing: A color image is printed using only black ink in different shades
■Paper size: Standard paper sizes or envelopes and business cards
■Paper orientation: Landscape or portrait
■Print layout: Normal, banner, booklet, or poster
■Duplex: Normal or two-sided printing

Describe How to Optimize Printer Performance
With printers, most optimization is completed through the software supplied with the driv-
ers, as shown in Figure 7-14.
Figure 7-14
Color Calibration
20
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
The software has tools to optimize performance:
■Print spool settings let you cancel or pause current print jobs in the printer queue.
■Color calibration lets you adjust settings to match the colors on the screen to the col-
ors on the printed sheet.
■Paper orientation lets you select landscape or portrait image layout.
Describe How to Print a Test Page
After installing a printer, you should print a test page to verify that the printer is operating
properly. The test page confirms that the driver software is installed and working correctly
and that the printer and computer are communicating. 
Printing a Test Page
To print a test page manually, choose Start > Printers and Faxes to display the Printers and
Faxes menu.
Right-click the desired printer and choose Properties. Click the General tab and click
Print Test Page, as shown in Figure 7-15.
A dialog box opens, asking you if the page printed correctly. If the page did not print, built-
in help files will assist you in troubleshooting the problem.

Figure 7-15
Print Test Page
Chapter 7: Fundamental Printers and Scanners
21
Printing from an Application
You can also test a printer by printing a test page from an application such as Notepad or
WordPad. To access Notepad, choose Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad.
A blank document opens. Enter some text in the document, and then print it by choosing
File > Print.
Testing a Printer
You can also print from the command line to test the printer. Printing from the command
line is limited to ASCII files, such as .txt and .bat files. To send a file to the printer from the
command line, choose Start > Run. The Run box appears. Enter cmd in the Run box, and
then click OK. At the command-line prompt, enter the command print thefile.txt.
Testing the Printer from the Printer Panel
Most printers have a front panel with controls to allow you to generate test pages. This
method of printing enables you to verify the printer operation separately from the network
or computer. Consult the printer manufacturer’s website or documentation to learn how to
print a test page from the printer’s front panel. 
Describe How to Share a Printer
Printer sharing enables multiple users or clients to access a printer that they are not directly
connected to. Figure 7-16 shows several computers with different operating systems, all
connected to the same shared printer. This arrangement reduces the expense on a network,
because fewer printers are required.

Figure 7-16

22
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Setting up printer sharing is simple with Windows XP. The following steps enable a com-
puter to share a printer:
Step 1.
Choose Start > Printers and Faxes.
Step 2.
Right-click the printer, and choose Properties.
Step 3.
Click the Sharing tab.
Step 4.
Click the Share this printer radio button, as shown in Figure 7-17.
Figure 7-17

How To

Step 5.
Keep or change the share name.
Step 6.
Click Apply.
All the computers that use the shared printer must have the correct drivers installed. Drivers
for other operating systems can be installed on the print server.
To connect to the printer from another computer on the network, choose Start > Printers
and Faxes > Add Printer. The Add Printer Wizard appears. Follow the steps using the
wizard. 
Describe the Types of Scanners Currently
Available
As a computer technician, you may be required to purchase, repair, or maintain a scanner.
The customer may ask you to perform the following tasks:
■Select a scanner.
■Install and configure a scanner.
■Troubleshoot a scanner.
After completing this section, you will meet the following objectives:
■Describe scanner types, resolution, and interfaces.
■Describe all-in-one devices.
■Describe flatbed scanners.
■Describe handheld scanners.
■Describe drum scanners.
■Compare costs of different types of scanners.
Describe Scanner Types, Resolution, and Interfaces
Scanners are used to convert printed data or images into an electronic data format that a
computer can store or process as required. After an image has been scanned, it can be
saved, modified, and even e-mailed, as you would with any other file. Although most scan-
ners perform the same operation, different types of scanners are available, as shown in
Figure 7-18 and described in the following list:
■All-in-one: Combination device that can scan, print, send faxes, and make copies
■Flatbed: Single-purpose device that converts hard-copy data to an electronic image
■Drum: High-quality scanner that spins film around a drum while a fixed laser or other
beam of light captures the image as it spins
■Handheld: Portable scanner that is small enough to drag over text in books or other
materials
Chapter 7: Fundamental Printers and Scanners

Drum
As with printers, the features, quality, and speed of the different types of scanners vary.
Scanners typically create an RGB image that can be converted into common image formats
such as JPEG, TIFF, BMP, and PNG. An RGB image has three channels: red, green, and
blue. RGB channels generally follow the color receptors of the human eye and are used in
computer displays and image scanners.
Some scanners can create text documents using optical character recognition (OCR) soft-
ware. OCR software is used to convert a scanned printed page into text that can be edited
with a word processor. A scanner’s resolution is measured in dots per inch (dpi). As with
printers, the higher the dpi, the better the image quality.
To allow communication of data, the scanner and computer must have compatible inter-
faces. The interfaces and cables used for printers typically are the same as the interfaces
and cables used for scanners, as shown in Figure 7-19.
Describe All-in-One Devices
An all-in-one device combines the functionality of multiple devices into one physical piece
of hardware. The devices may include media card readers and hard drives for storage. All-
in-one devices generally include these functions:
■Scanner
■Printer
■Copier
■Fax

Figure 7-19
Scanner Interfaces and Cables
Chapter 7: Fundamental Printers and Scanners
25
All-in-one devices typically are used in home-office environments or where space is limit-
ed. These devices often are used with a computer but can operate alone to copy and fax
documents.
Table 7-6 lists some advantages and disadvantages of an all-in-one device.

Not modular: if one device breaks, not all devices 
fax, and printer
may be operational
Low cost
Not designed for heavy use
Upgrades are easier: software is 
designed for all devices
Connection and setup are easy:
one port
Describe Flatbed Scanners
Flatbed scanners, shown in Figure 7-20, are often used to scan books and photographs for
archiving. An electronic image is acquired by placing the book or photograph facedown on
the glass. The scanner head, consisting of an array of image sensors, lies beneath the glass
and moves along the item, capturing the image.

Figure 7-20
Flatbed Scanner
26
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Sheet feeders can be used with flatbed scanners to scan multiple images. A sheet feeder is a
device that can be attached to some flatbed scanners to hold multiple sheets and feed them
into the scanner one at a time. This feature allows for faster scanning; however, the image
quality is usually not as good as a flatbed scanner that does not use a sheet feeder.
Table 7-7 lists some advantages and disadvantages of flatbed scanners.
Table 7-7
Flatbed Scanner Pros and Cons
Advantages
Disadvantages
Most common type of desktop scanner
Limited scanning size based on size of scan-
ning bed
Low cost
Connection and setup are easy: one port
Describe Handheld Scanners
A handheld scanner, as shown in Figure 7-21, is small and portable. It is difficult to
smoothly scan an image using a handheld scanner. To scan an item, carefully pass the scan-
ner head across the item that you want to scan. As with a flatbed scanner, digital images are
made from the images collected by the handheld scanner.
Figure 7-21
Handheld Scanner

When you want to scan an item larger than the head of the handheld scanner, you must
make more than one pass to capture the full image. It may be difficult to re-create the origi-
nal image digitally when it is scanned in more than one pass. The images must be put back
together to form a single image of the item that was scanned.
Table 7-8 lists some advantages and disadvantages of handheld scanners.
Table 7-8
Handheld Scanner Pros and Cons
Advantages
Disadvantages
Small
Multiple passes may need to be made to scan large
items
Portable
Consistent image results vary, depending on the user
experience
Can scan images that cannot fit 
in or on any other type of scanner
Describe Drum Scanners
Drum scanners, as shown in Figure 7-22, produce a high-quality transfer of an image. Drum
scanners are usually used commercially but are being replaced by lower-priced, high-quality
flatbed scanners. Many drum scanners are still in use for high-end reproductions, such as
archiving photographs in museums.
Figure 7-22
Drum Scanner
Chapter 7: Fundamental Printers and Scanners
27
To scan an image using a drum scanner, you attach the image to a revolving drum or load it
into a supporting canister. The drum is rotated at high speed across optical scanners. The
optical scanners move slowly across the drum surface until the entire image is captured. The
captured image is then reproduced by the computer as a digital image file.
Table 7-9 lists some advantages and disadvantages of drum scanners.

Describe the Installation and Configuration
Process for Scanners
When you purchase a scanner, the installation and configuration information is usually sup-
plied by the manufacturer. An installation CD that includes drivers, manuals, and diagnostic
software is included with the scanner. The same tools may also be available as downloads
from the manufacturer’s website.
After completing this section, you will meet the following objectives:
■Explain how to power and connect a scanner.
■Describe how to install and update the device driver.
■Identify configuration options and default settings.
Explain How to Power and Connect a Scanner
Like printers, scanners can connect to a computer using the USB, FireWire, network, or
parallel port interface. Some scanners may connect using a SCSI interface.
Scanners that are built into an all-in-one device should be plugged directly into an AC wall
outlet. This provides the AC current necessary to operate the all-in-one device. Other types
of scanners may acquire power through the USB or FireWire connector.
After unpacking the scanner, connect the appropriate power and data cables. Use the scan-
ner documentation as your guide, or check the manufacturer’s website for instructions.
Describe How to Install and Update the Device Driver
As soon as you have connected and started the scanner, the computer operating system
might be able to discover the scanner through the plug-and-play process. If the scanner is
discovered, the operating system might automatically install a driver. 
After you set up a scanner, install the driver software that the manufacturer includes with
the scanner. This driver is usually more current than the drivers on your computer. It may
also provide more functionality than the basic driver from Windows.
28
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

As with a printer, you might want to install drivers from the manufacturer’s website to gain
additional functionality, diagnostic tools, and troubleshooting utilities. Download software
from the manufacturer’s website, and follow any directions provided to install the software
and utilities for your scanner. Some scanning software automatically downloads and installs
updated software, drivers, or firmware. Follow the directions provided by the update utility
to install these files.
Lab 7.4.2: Install All-in-One Device and Software
In this lab you install an all-in-one device. You find, download, and update the driver and
the software for the all-in-one device. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and
Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You may perform this lab now or wait until
the end of the chapter.
Identify Configuration Options and Default Settings
Scanners have configuration options and default settings that differ between model types
and manufacturers. 
A scanner might come with a basic graphic editing software package for editing photo-
graphs and other images. Editing software packages may include OCR software that allows
text in a scanned image to be manipulated.
Some of the configuration options that might be available on a scanner are as follows:
■Color, grayscale, or black-and-white scanning
■One-touch scanning into your choice of software
■Quality and resolution choices
■Sheet feeders
As shown in Figure 7-23, color calibration between devices is important so that you see
true representations of color. To calibrate a scanner, scan a graphic that contains specific
colors. A calibration application installed on the computer compares the scanner’s output
against the known colors of the sample graphic on the display. The software adjusts the
scanner’s color accordingly. When your scanner, monitor, and printer treat the same colors
in the same way, the image you print matches the image you scan.

Identify and Apply Common Preventive
Maintenance Techniques for Printers and
Scanners
Printers and scanners have many moving parts that can wear out over time or through
extended use. They must be maintained regularly to operate correctly.
Moving parts can be affected by dust and other air particles. Clean printers and scanners
regularly to avoid downtime, loss of productivity, and high repair costs.
After completing this section, you will meet the following objectives:
■Describe printer maintenance.
■Describe scanner maintenance.
Describe Printer Maintenance
Printers have many moving parts and require a higher level of maintenance than most other
electronic devices. Impurities produced by the printer collect on the internal components.
Over time, if the impurities are not removed, the printer may malfunction. The maintenance
schedule for a printer can be found in the manual or on the manufacturer’s website.
Caution
Be sure to unplug the printer from the electrical source before beginning any type of maintenance.
Most printers come with printer monitoring and diagnostic software from the manufacturer
that can help you maintain the printer. Observe the guidelines from the manufacturer for
cleaning the following printer and scanner components:
■Printer roller surfaces
■Printer and scanner paper-handling mechanisms

The type and quality of paper and ink used can affect the printer’s life:
■Paper selection: High-quality paper can help ensure that the printer operates efficiently
and for a long time. Many types of printer paper are available, including inkjet and
laser. The printer manufacturer may recommend the type of paper that should be used
for best results. Some papers, especially photo paper and transparencies, have a right
side and a wrong side. Load the paper according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
■Ink selection: The manufacturer recommends the brand and type of ink that you
should use. If the wrong type of ink is installed, the printer may not work, or the print
quality may be reduced. You should avoid refilling the ink cartridges, because the ink
may leak. 
Describe Scanner Maintenance
The scanner surface should be kept clean. If the glass becomes dirty, consult the manufac-
turer’s user manual for cleaning recommendations. To prevent liquid from leaking into the
scanner case, do not spray glass cleaner directly on the device. Dampen a cloth with the
cleaner, and then apply the cleaner gently to the glass.
If the inside of the glass becomes dirty, check the manual for instructions on how to open
the unit or remove the glass from the scanner. If possible, thoroughly clean both sides of the
glass, and replace the glass as it was originally set in the scanner. When the scanner is not
in use, keep the lid closed. Keep a handheld scanner in a safe place. Also, never lay any-
thing heavy on a scanner, because you may damage the casing or internal parts.
Troubleshoot Printers and Scanners
With printer and scanner problems, a technician must be able to determine if the problem
exists with the device, the cable connection, or the computer that it is attached to. Follow
the steps outlined in this section to accurately identify, repair, and document the problem.

Summary
This chapter discussed various types of printers and scanners. You learned that there are
many different types and sizes of printers and scanners, each with different capabilities,
speeds, and uses. You also learned that both printers and scanners can be connected directly
to computers, as well as shared across a network. This chapter also introduced the different
types of cables and interfaces available to connect a printer or scanner. Other facts about
printers and scanners covered in this chapter include the following:
■Some printers and scanners have low output and are adequate for home use, whereas
other printers and scanners have high output and are designed for commercial use.
■Printers may have different speeds and quality of print.
■Older printers and scanners use parallel cables and ports. Newer printers and scanners
typically use USB or FireWire cables and connectors.
■Larger printers and scanners may also have a NIC port to connect to a network.
■Newer printers and scanners are plug-and-play. The computer automatically installs the
necessary drivers.
■If the computer does not automatically install the device drivers, you have to supply the
drivers on a CD or download them from the manufacturer’s website.
■Most optimization is done through software drivers and utilities.
■After you have set up the printer or scanner, you can share the device with other users
on the network. This arrangement is cost-efficient because there is no need for every
user to have a printer or scanner.
■A good preventive maintenance program will extend the life of printers and scanners
and keep them performing well.
■Troubleshooting printer and laptop problems requires the technician to identify, repair,
and document the problem. Troubleshooting steps include gathering data from cus-
tomer, verifying the obvious issues, trying quick solutions first, gathering data from the
computer, evaluating the problem, implementing the solution, and closing with the cus-
tomer.

This chapter provides an overview of network principles, standards, and purposes. The fol-
lowing types of networks are discussed in this chapter:
■Local-area network (LAN)
■Wide-area network (WAN)
■Wireless LAN (WLAN)
This chapter discusses the different types of network topologies, protocols, and logical
models as well as the hardware needed to create a network. Configuration, troubleshooting,
and preventive maintenance also are covered. In addition, you will learn about network soft-
ware, communication methods, and hardware relationships.
Explain the Principles of Networking
Networks are systems that are formed by links. Websites that allow individuals to link to
each other’s pages are called social networking sites. A set of related ideas can be called a
conceptual network. The connections you have with all your friends can be called your per-
sonal network.
People use the following networks every day:
■Mail delivery system
■Telephone system
■Public transportation system
■Corporate computer network
■The Internet
Computers can be linked by networks to share data and resources. A network can be as sim-
ple as two computers connected by a single cable or as complex as hundreds of computers
connected to devices that control the flow of information. Converged data networks can
include general-purpose computers, such as PCs and servers, as well as devices with more
specific functions, including printers, phones, televisions, and game consoles.
All data, voice, video, and converged networks share information and use various methods
to direct how this information flows. The information on the network goes from one place
to another, sometimes via different paths, to arrive at the appropriate destination.
The public transportation system is similar to a data network. The cars, trucks, and other
vehicles are like the messages that travel within the network. Each driver defines a starting
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks

point (source) and an ending point (destination). Within this system are rules such as stop
signs and traffic lights that control the flow from the source to the destination.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Define computer networks.
■Explain the benefits of networking.
Define Computer Networks
A computer data network is a collection of hosts connected by networking devices. A host
is any device that sends and receives information on the network. Peripherals are devices
that are connected to hosts. Some devices can serve as either hosts or peripherals. For
example, a printer connected to your laptop that is on a network is acting as a peripheral. If
the printer is connected directly to a networking device, such as a hub, switch, or router, it
is acting as a host.
Computer networks are used globally in businesses, homes, schools, and government agen-
cies. Many of these networks are connected to each other through the Internet.
Many different types of devices can connect to a network:
■Desktop computers
■Laptop computers
■Printers
■Scanners
■PDAs
■Smartphones
■File/print servers
A network can share many different types of resources:
■Services, such as printing or scanning
■Storage space on removable devices, such as hard drives or optical drives
■Applications, such as databases
You can use networks to access information stored on other computers, print documents
using shared printers, and synchronize the calendar between your computer and your
Smartphone.

Network devices are linked using a variety of connections:
■Copper cabling uses electrical signals to transmit data between devices.
■Fiber-optic cabling uses glass or plastic wire, also called fiber, to carry information as
light pulses.
■Wireless connection uses radio signals, infrared technology (laser), or satellite trans-
missions.
Explain the Benefits of Networking
The benefits of networking computers and other devices include lower costs and increased
productivity. With networks, resources can be shared, which results in less duplication and
corruption of data. The following are some benefits of using networks:
■Fewer peripherals are needed: Figure 8-1 shows that many devices can be connected on
a network. Each computer on the network does not need its own printer, scanner, or
backup device. Multiple printers can be set up in a central location and can be shared
among the network users. All network users send print jobs to a central print server that
manages the print requests. The print server can distribute print jobs over multiple
printers or can queue jobs that require a specific printer.
Figure 8-1
Shared Resources
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks

■Increased communication capabilities: Networks provide several different collaboration
tools that can be used to communicate between network users. Online collaboration
tools include e-mail, forums and chats, voice and video, and instant messaging. With
these tools, users can communicate with friends, family, and colleagues.

■Avoid file duplication and corruption: A server manages network resources. Servers
store data and share it with users on a network. Confidential or sensitive data can be
protected and shared with the users who have permission to access that data.
Document-tracking software can be used to prevent users from overwriting files, or
changing files that others are accessing at the same time.
■Lower-cost licensing: Application licensing can be expensive for individual computers.
Many software vendors offer site licenses for networks, which can dramatically reduce
the cost of software. The site license allows a group of people or an entire organization
to use the application for a single fee.
■Centralized administration: Centralized administration reduces the number of people
needed to manage the devices and data on the network, reducing time and cost to the
company. Individual network users do not need to manage their own data and devices.
One administrator can control the data, devices, and permissions of users on the net-
work. Backing up data is easier because the data is stored in a central location.
■Conserve resources: Data processing can be distributed across many computers to pre-
vent one computer from becoming overloaded with processing tasks. 
Describe Types of Networks
Data networks continue to evolve in complexity, use, and design. Different types of net-
works have different descriptive names. A computer network is identified by the following
specific characteristics:
■The area it serves
■How the data is stored
■How the resources are managed
■How the network is organized
■The type of networking devices used
■The type of media used to connect the devices
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe a LAN.
■Describe a WAN.
■Describe a WLAN.
■Explain peer-to-peer networks.
■Explain client/server networks.

Describe a LAN
A local-area network (LAN) is a group of interconnected devices that is under the same
administrative control, as shown in Figure 8-2. In the past, LANs were considered to be
small networks that existed in a single physical location. Although LANs can be as small as
a single local network installed in a home or small office, over time, the definition of LANs
has evolved to include interconnected local networks consisting of many hundreds of
devices, installed in multiple buildings and locations.
Figure 8-2
Local-Area Network
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
7
The important thing to remember is that all the local networks within a LAN are under one
administrative control group that governs the security and access control policies that are in
force on the network. In this context, the word “local” in local-area network refers to local
consistent control rather than being physically close to each other. Devices in a LAN may
be physically close, but this is not a requirement.
Describe a WAN
Wide-area networks (WAN) are networks that connect LANs in geographically separated
locations, as shown in Figure 8-3. The most common example of a WAN is the Internet.
The Internet is a large WAN that is composed of millions of interconnected LANs.
Telecommunications service providers (TSP) are used to interconnect these LANs at differ-
ent locations.

Figure 8-3
Wide-Area Network

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Describe a WLAN
In a traditional LAN, devices are interconnected using copper cabling. In some environ-
ments, installing copper cabling may not be practical, desirable, or even possible. In these
situations, wireless devices are used to transmit and receive data using radio waves. These
networks are called wireless LANs (WLAN). Figure 8-4 shows a WLAN. As with LANs,
on a WLAN you can share resources, such as files and printers, and access the Internet.
Figure 8-4
Wireless Local-Area Network

In a WLAN, wireless devices connect to access points within a specified area. Access
points typically are connected to the network using copper cabling. Instead of providing
copper cabling to every network host, only the wireless access point is connected to the net-
work with copper cabling. WLAN coverage can be small and limited to the area of a room
or can have greater range.
Explain Peer-to-Peer Networks
In a peer-to-peer network, devices are connected directly to each other without any addi-
tional networking devices between them, as shown in Figure 8-5. In this type of network,
each device has equivalent capabilities and responsibilities. Individual users are responsible
for their own resources and can decide which data and devices to share. Because individual
users are responsible for the resources on their own computers, the network has no central
point of control or administration.
Figure 8-5
Peer-to-Peer Network
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
9
Peer-to-peer networks work best in environments with ten or fewer computers. Because
individual users are in control of their own computers, there is no need to hire a dedicated
network administrator.
Peer-to-peer networks have several disadvantages:
■They have no centralized network administration, which makes it difficult to determine
who controls resources on the network.
■They have no centralized security. Each computer must use separate security measures
for data protection.
■The network becomes more complex and difficult to manage as the number of comput-
ers on the network increases.
■There may be no centralized data storage. Separate data backups must be maintained.
This responsibility falls on the individual users.

Peer-to-peer networks still exist inside larger networks today. Even on a large client net-
work, users can still share resources directly with other users without using a network serv-
er. In your home, if you have more than one computer, you can set up a peer-to-peer net-
work. You can share files with other computers, send messages between them, and print
documents to a shared printer. 
Explain Client/Server Networks
In a client/server network, shown in Figure 8-6, the client requests information or services
from the server. The server provides the requested information or service to the client.
Servers on a client/server network commonly perform some of the processing work for
client machines, such as sorting through a database before delivering only the records
requested by the client.
Figure 8-6
Client/Server Network
10
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
One example of a client/server network is a corporate environment in which employees use
a company e-mail server to send, receive, and store e-mail. The e-mail client on an employ-
ee computer issues a request to the e-mail server for any unread e-mail. The server responds
by sending the requested e-mail to the client.
In a client/server model, the servers are maintained by network administrators. Data back-
ups and security measures are implemented by the network administrator. The network
administrator also controls user access to the network resources. All the data on the network
is stored on a centralized file server. Shared printers on the network are managed by a cen-
tralized print server. Network users with the proper permissions can access both the data
and shared printers. Each user must provide an authorized username and password to gain
access to network resources that he or she is permitted to use.

For data protection, an administrator performs a routine backup of all the files on the
servers. If a computer crashes, or data is lost, the administrator can easily recover the data
from a recent backup. 
Describe Basic Networking Concepts and
Technologies
As a computer technician, you will be required to configure and troubleshoot computers on
a network. To effectively configure a computer on the network, you should understand IP
addressing, protocols, and other network concepts.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Explain bandwidth and data transmission.
■Describe IP addressing.
■Define DHCP.
■Describe Internet protocols and applications.
■Define ICMP.
Explain Bandwidth and Data Transmission
Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transmitted within a fixed time period. When
data is sent over a computer network, it is broken into small chunks called packets. Each
packet contains headers. A header is information added to each packet that contains the
packet’s source and destination. A header also contains information that describes how to
put all the packets back together again at the destination. The size of the bandwidth deter-
mines the amount of information that can be transmitted.
Bandwidth is measured in bits per second and usually is denoted by any of the following
units of measure:
■bps is bits per second.
■kbps is kilobits per second.
■Mbps is megabits per second.
Note
1 byte is equal to 8 bits and is abbreviated with a capital B. 1 MBps is approximately 8 Mbps.
Figure 8-7 shows how bandwidth on a network can be compared to a highway. In this
example, the cars and trucks represent the data. The number of lanes on the highway
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
11

represents the number of cars that can travel on the highway at the same time. An eight-lane
highway can handle four times the number of cars that a two-lane highway can.
Figure 8-7
Highway Analogy
12
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
The data that is transmitted over the network can flow using one of three modes: simplex,
half duplex, or full duplex:
■Simplex: Simplex, also called unidirectional, is a single one-way transmission. An
example of simplex transmission is the signal that is sent from a TV station to your TV.
■Half duplex: When data flows in one direction at a time, this is known as half duplex.
With half duplex, the communications channel allows alternating transmission in two
directions, but not in both directions simultaneously. Two-way radios, such as police
and emergency communications mobile radios, work with half-duplex transmissions.
When you press the button on the microphone to transmit, you cannot hear the person
on the other end. If people at both ends try to talk at the same time, neither transmis-
sion gets through.
■Full duplex: When data flows in both directions at the same time, this is known as full
duplex. Although the data flows in both directions, the bandwidth is measured in only
one direction. A network cable with 100 Mbps in full-duplex mode has a bandwidth of
100 Mbps. A telephone conversation is an example of full-duplex communication. Both
people can talk and be heard at the same time.
Full-duplex networking technology increases network performance because data can be sent
and received at the same time. Broadband technology allows multiple signals to travel on
the same wire simultaneously. Broadband technologies, such as digital subscriber line
(DSL) and cable, operate in full-duplex mode. With a DSL connection, for example, users
can download data to their computer and talk on the telephone at the same time.

Describe IP Addressing
An IP address is a number that is used to identify a device on the network. Each device on
a network must have a unique IP address to communicate with other network devices. As
noted earlier, a host is a device that sends or receives information on the network. Network
devices are devices that move data across the network, including hubs, switches, and
routers. On a LAN, each host and network device must have an IP address within the same
network to be able to communicate with each other.
A person’s name and fingerprints usually do not change. They provide a label or address for
the person’s physical aspect—the body. A person’s mailing address, on the other hand,
relates to where the person lives or picks up mail. This address can change. On a host, the
Media Access Control (MAC) address (explained in the section “Manual Configuration”) is
assigned to the host NIC and is known as the physical address. The physical address
remains the same regardless of where the host is placed on the network in the same way
that fingerprints remain with someone regardless of where she goes.
The IP address is similar to someone’s mailing address. It is known as a logical address
because it is logically assigned based on the host location. The IP address, or network
address, is based on the local network and is assigned to each host by a network administra-
tor. This process is similar to the local government assigning a street address based on the
logical description of the city or village and neighborhood.
An IP address consists of a series of 32 binary bits (1s and 0s). It is very difficult for
humans to read a binary IP address. For this reason, the 32 bits are grouped into four 8-bit
bytes called octets. An IP address, even in this grouped format, is hard for humans to read,
write, and remember. Therefore, each octet is presented as its decimal value, separated by a
decimal point or period. This format is called dotted-decimal notation. When a host is con-
figured with an IP address, it is entered as a dotted-decimal number, such as 192.168.1.5.
Imagine if you had to enter the 32-bit binary equivalent of this:
11000000101010000000000100000101. If you mistyped just 1 bit, the address would be
different, and the host may not be able to communicate on the network.
The logical 32-bit IP address is hierarchical and is composed of two parts. The first part
identifies the network, and the second part identifies a host on that network. Both parts are
required in an IP address. For example, if a host has an IP address of 192.168.18.57, the
first three octets, 192.168.18, identify the network portion of the address, and the last octet,
57, identifies the host. This is called hierarchical addressing, because the network portion
indicates the network on which each unique host address is located. Routers only need to
know how to reach each network, not the location of each individual host.
IP addresses are divided into the following five classes:
■Class A is for large networks, implemented by large companies and some countries.
■Class B is for medium-sized networks, implemented by universities.
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
13

■Class C is for small networks, implemented by ISPs for customer subscriptions.
■Class D is for special use for multicasting.
■Class E is used for experimental testing.
Subnet Mask
The subnet mask indicates the network portion of an IP address. Like the IP address, the
subnet mask is a dotted-decimal number. Usually all hosts within a LAN use the same sub-
net mask. Figure 8-8 shows default subnet masks for usable IP addresses that are mapped to
the first three classes of IP addresses:
■255.0.0.0: Class A, which indicates that the first octet of the IP address is the network
portion
■255.255.0.0: Class B, which indicates that the first two octets of the IP address are the
network portion
■255.255.255.0: Class C, which indicates that the first three octets of the IP address are
the network portion
Figure 8-8
IP Address Classes
14
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
If an organization owns one Class B network but needs to provide IP addresses for four
LANs, the organization would have to subdivide the Class B address into four smaller
parts. Subnetting is a logical division of a network. It provides the means to divide a net-
work, and the subnet mask specifies how it is subdivided. An experienced network adminis-
trator typically performs subnetting. After the subnetting scheme has been created, the
proper IP addresses and subnet masks can be configured on the hosts in the four LANs.
These skills are taught in the Cisco Networking Academy courses related to CCNA-level
networking skills. 

Manual Configuration
In a network with a small number of hosts, it is easy to manually configure each device
with the proper IP address. A network administrator who understands IP addressing should
assign the addresses and should know how to choose a valid address for a particular net-
work. The IP address that is entered is unique for each host within the same network or
subnet.
To manually enter an IP address on a host, go to the TCP/IP settings in the Properties win-
dow for the Network Interface Card (NIC). The NIC is the hardware that enables a comput-
er to connect to a network. It has an address called the MAC address. Whereas the IP
address is a logical address that is defined by the network administrator, a MAC address is
“burned in,” or permanently programmed into the NIC when it is manufactured. The IP
address of a NIC can be changed, but the MAC address never changes.
The main difference between an IP address and a MAC address is that the MAC address is
used to deliver frames on the LAN, while an IP address is used to transport frames outside
the LAN. A frame is a data packet, along with address information added to the beginning
and end of the packet before transmission over the network. After a frame is delivered to
the destination LAN, the MAC address is used to deliver the frame to the end host on 
that LAN.
If more than a few computers comprise the LAN, manually configuring IP addresses for
every host on the network can be time-consuming and prone to errors. In this case, using a
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server would automatically assign IP
addresses and greatly simplify the addressing process.
Worksheet 8.3.2: Identify IP Address Classes
In this worksheet you identify the IP address class for an IP address. Refer to the worksheet
in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You
may perform this worksheet now or wait until the end of the chapter. 
Define DHCP
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a software utility used to dynamically
assign IP addresses to network devices. This dynamic process eliminates the need to manu-
ally assign IP addresses. A DHCP server can be set up and the hosts can be configured to
automatically obtain an IP address. When a computer is set to obtain an IP address automat-
ically, all the other IP addressing configuration boxes are dimmed, as shown in Figure 8-9.
The server maintains a list of IP addresses to assign, and it manages the process so that
every device on the network receives a unique IP address. Each address is held for a prede-
termined amount of time. When the time expires, the DHCP server can use this address for
any computer that joins the network.
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
15

Figure 8-9
TCP/IP Properties
16
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
This is the IP address information that a DHCP server can assign to hosts:
■IP address
■Subnet mask
■Default gateway
■Optional values, such as a Domain Name System (DNS) server address
The DHCP server receives a request from a host. The server then selects IP address infor-
mation from a set of predefined addresses that are stored in a database. After the IP address
information is selected, the DHCP server offers these values to the requesting host on the
network. If the host accepts the offer, the DHCP server leases the IP address for a specific
period of time.
Using a DHCP server simplifies the administration of a network because the software keeps
track of IP addresses. Automatically configuring TCP/IP also reduces the possibility of
assigning duplicate or invalid IP addresses. Before a computer on the network can take
advantage of the DHCP server services, the computer must be able to identify the server on
the local network. You can configure a computer to accept an IP address from a DHCP
server by clicking the Obtain an IP address automatically option in the NIC configura-
tion window, as shown in Figure 8-9.
If your computer cannot communicate with the DHCP server to obtain an IP address, the
Windows operating system automatically assigns a private IP address. If your computer is
assigned an IP address in the range of 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255, it can communicate

with only other computers in the same range. An example of when these private addresses
would be useful is in a classroom lab where you want to prevent access outside to your net-
work. This operating system feature is called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA).
APIPA continually requests an IP address from a DHCP server for your computer. 
Describe Internet Protocols and Applications
A protocol is a set of rules. Internet protocols are sets of rules governing communication
within and between computers on a network. Protocol specifications define the format of
the messages that are exchanged. A letter sent through the postal system also uses proto-
cols. Part of the protocol specifies where on the envelope the delivery address needs to be
written. If the delivery address is written in the wrong place, the letter cannot be delivered.
Timing is crucial to network operation. Protocols require messages to arrive within a certain
amount of time so that computers do not wait indefinitely for messages that may have been
lost. Therefore, systems maintain one or more timers during transmission of data. Protocols
also initiate alternative actions if the network does not meet the timing rules. Many proto-
cols consist of a suite of other protocols that are stacked in layers. These layers depend on
the operation of the other layers in the suite to function properly.
These are the main functions of protocols:
■Identifying errors
■Compressing the data
■Deciding how the data is to be sent
■Addressing the data
■Deciding how to announce sent and received data
Although many other protocols exist, Table 8-1 summarizes the functions of some of the
more common protocols used on networks and the Internet.

To understand how networks and the Internet work, you must be familiar with the common-
ly used protocols. These protocols are used to browse the web, send and receive e-mail, and
transfer data files. You will encounter other protocols as your experience in IT grows, but
they are not used as often as the common protocols described here:
■TCP/IP: The TCP/IP suite of protocols has become the dominant standard for internet-
working. TCP/IP represents a set of public standards that specify how packets of infor-
mation are exchanged between computers over one or more networks.
■IPX/SPX: Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange is the protocol
suite originally employed by Novell Corporation’s network operating system, NetWare.
It delivers functions similar to those included in TCP/IP. Novell in its current releases
supports the TCP/IP suite. A large installed base of NetWare networks continue to use
IPX/SPX.
■NetBEUI: NetBIOS Extended User Interface is a protocol used primarily on small
Windows NT networks. NetBEUI cannot be routed or used by routers to talk to each
other on a large network. NetBEUI is suitable for small peer-to-peer networks, involv-
ing a few computers directly connected to each other. It can be used in conjunction
with another routable protocol such as TCP/IP. This gives the network administrator the
advantages of the high performance of NetBEUI within the local network and the abili-
ty to communicate beyond the LAN over TCP/IP.
■AppleTalk: AppleTalk is a protocol suite to network Macintosh computers. It is com-
posed of a comprehensive set of protocols that span the seven layers of the Open
Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model. The AppleTalk protocol was designed
to run over LocalTalk, which is the Apple LAN physical topology. This protocol is also
designed to run over major LAN types, notably Ethernet and Token Ring.
■HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol governs how files such as text, graphics, sound,
and video are exchanged on the World Wide Web (WWW). The Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) developed the standards for HTTP.
■FTP: File Transfer Protocol provides services for file transfer and manipulation. FTP
allows multiple simultaneous connections to remote file systems.

■IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol is also used to download e-mail from a
remote mail server.
■SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is used to send e-mail to a remote e-mail server.
The more you understand about each of these protocols, the more you will understand how
networks and the Internet work.
Define ICMP
Devices on a network use Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to send control and
error messages to computers and servers. ICMP has several different uses, such as announc-
ing network errors, announcing network congestion, and troubleshooting.
Packet Internet groper (ping) is commonly used to test connections between computers.
Ping is a simple but highly useful command-line utility that determines whether a specific
IP address is accessible. You can ping the IP address to test IP connectivity. Ping works by
sending an ICMP echo request to a destination computer or other network device. The
receiving device then sends back an ICMP echo reply message to confirm connectivity.
Ping is a troubleshooting tool used to determine basic connectivity. Example 8-1 shows the
command-line switches that can be used with the ping command. Four ICMP echo requests
(pings) are sent to the destination computer. If it can be reached, the destination computer
responds with four ICMP echo replies. The percentage of successful replies can help you
determine the reliability and accessibility of the destination computer.

Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Ping statistics for 198.133.219.25:
Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 0, Lost = 4 (100% loss),
Other ICMP messages are used to report undelivered packets, data on an IP network that
includes source and destination IP addresses, and whether a device is too busy to handle the
packet. Data, in the form of a packet, arrives at a router, which is a networking device that
forwards data packets across networks toward their destinations. If the router does not know
where to send the packet, the router deletes it. The router then sends an ICMP message
back to the sending computer, informing it that the data was deleted. When a router
becomes very busy, it may send a different ICMP message to the sending computer, indicat-
ing that it should slow down because the network is congested. 

Describe the Physical Components of a
Network
Many devices can be used in a network to provide connectivity, as shown in Figure 8-10.
Which device you use depends on how many devices you are connecting, the type of con-
nections they use, and the speed at which the devices operate. These are the most common
devices on a network:
■Computers
■Hubs
■Switches
■Routers
■Wireless access points

The physical components of a network are needed to move data between these devices. The
characteristics of the media determine where and how the components are used. These are
the most common media used on networks:
■Twisted pair
■Fiber-optic cabling
■Radio waves

Network Devices
To make data transmission more extensible and efficient than a simple peer-to-peer net-
work, network designers use specialized network devices such as hubs, switches, routers,
and wireless access points to send data between devices.
Hubs
Hubs, shown in Figure 8-11, are devices that extend a network’s range by receiving data on
one port and then regenerating the data and sending it out to all other ports. This process
means that all traffic from a device connected to the hub is sent to all the other devices con-
nected to the hub every time the hub transmits data. This causes a large amount of network
traffic. Hubs are also called concentrators because they serve as a central connection point
for a LAN. They are also sometimes called multiport repeaters because they send data out
all the ports.

Bridges and Switches
Files are broken into small pieces of data, called packets, before they are transmitted over a
network. This process allows for error checking and easier retransmission if the packet is

lost or corrupted. Address information is added to the beginning and end of packets before
they are transmitted. The packet, along with the address information, is called a frame.
LANs are often divided into sections called segments, similar to how a company is divided
into departments. The boundaries of segments can be defined using a bridge. A bridge is a
device used to filter network traffic between LAN segments. Bridges keep a record of all
the devices on each segment to which the bridge is connected. When the bridge receives a
frame, it examines the destination address to determine if the frame is to be sent to a differ-
ent segment, or dropped. The bridge also helps improve the flow of data by keeping frames
confined to only the segment to which the frame belongs.
Switches, shown in Figure 8-12, are sometimes called multiport bridges. A typical bridge
may have just two ports, linking two segments of the same network. A switch has several
ports, depending on how many network segments are to be linked. A switch is a more
sophisticated device than a bridge. A switch maintains a table of the MAC addresses for
computers that are connected to each port. When a frame arrives at a port, the switch com-
pares the address information in the frame to its MAC address table. The switch then deter-
mines which port to use to forward the frame. 
Figure 8-12
Switch
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
23
Routers
Whereas a switch connects segments of a network, routers, shown in Figure 8-13, are
devices that connect entire networks to each other. Switches use MAC addresses to forward
a frame within a single network. Routers use IP addresses to forward frames to other net-
works. A router can be a computer with special network software installed, or it can be a
device built by network equipment manufacturers. Routers contain tables of IP addresses
along with optimal destination routes to other networks.

Wireless Access Points
Wireless access points, shown in Figure 8-14, provide network access to wireless devices
such as laptops and PDAs. The wireless access point uses radio waves to communicate with
radios in computers, PDAs, and other wireless access points. An access point has a limited
range of coverage. Large networks require several access points to provide adequate wire-
less coverage.
Figure 8-14
Wireless Access Point

Multipurpose Devices
Some network devices perform more than one function. It is more convenient to purchase
and configure one device that serves all your needs than to purchase a separate device for
each function. This is especially true for the home user. In your home, you would purchase
a multipurpose device instead of a switch, a router, and a wireless access point. The Linksys
300N, shown in Figure 8-15, is an example of a multipurpose device.

Identify the Names, Purposes, and Characteristics of
Common Network Cables
Until recently, cables were the only medium used to connect devices on networks. A wide
variety of networking cables are available. Coaxial and twisted-pair cables use copper to
transmit data. Fiber-optic cables use glass or plastic to transmit data. These cables differ in
bandwidth, size, and cost. You need to know what type of cable to use in different situations
so that you install the correct cables for the job. You also need to be able to troubleshoot
and repair problems you encounter.
Twisted Pair
Twisted pair is a type of copper cabling that is used for telephone communications and
most Ethernet networks. A pair of wires forms a circuit that can transmit data. The pair is
twisted to provide protection against crosstalk, which is the noise generated by adjacent
pairs of wires in the cable. Pairs of copper wires are encased in color-coded plastic insula-
tion and are twisted together. An outer jacket protects the bundles of twisted pairs. Figure 8-
16 shows a twisted-pair cable.

Figure 8-16
Twisted-Pair Cabling
26
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
When electricity flows through a copper wire, a magnetic field is created around the wire.
A circuit has two wires, and in a circuit, the two wires have oppositely-charged magnetic
fields. When the two wires of the circuit are next to each other, the magnetic fields cancel
each other out. This is called the cancellation effect. Without the cancellation effect, your
network communications become slow because of the interference caused by the magnetic
fields.
The two basic types of twisted-pair cables are as follows:
■Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is cable that has two or four pairs of wires. This type of
cable relies solely on the cancellation effect produced by the twisted-wire pairs that
limits signal degradation caused by electromagnetic interface (EMI) and radio frequen-
cy interference (RFI). UTP is the most commonly used cabling in networks. UTP
cables have a range of 328 feet (100 m).
■With shielded twisted pair (STP), each pair of wires is wrapped in metallic foil to bet-
ter shield the wires from noise. Four pairs of wires are then wrapped in an overall
metallic braid or foil. STP reduces electrical noise from within the cable. It also
reduces EMI and RFI from outside the cable.
Although STP prevents interference better than UTP, STP is more expensive because of
extra shielding. It also is more difficult to install because of the thickness. In addition, the
metallic shielding must be grounded at both ends. If it’s improperly grounded, the shield
acts like an antenna, picking up unwanted signals. STP is primarily used outside North
America. STP cables also have a range of 328 feet (100 m).

Category Rating
UTP comes in several categories that are based on two factors:
■The number of wires in the cable
■The number of twists in those wires
Category 3 is the wiring used for telephone systems and Ethernet LAN at 10 Mbps.
Category 3 has four pairs of wires.
Category 5 and Category 5e have four pairs of wires with a transmission rate of 100 Mbps.
Category 5 and Category 5e are the most common network cables used. Category 5e has
more twists per foot than Category 5 wiring. These extra twists further prevent interference
from outside sources and the other wires within the cable.
Some Category 6 cables use a plastic divider to separate the pairs of wires, which prevents
interference. The pairs also have more twists than Category 5e cable.
Coaxial Cable
Coaxial cable is a copper-cored cable surrounded by a heavy shielding, as shown in Figure
8-17. Coaxial cable is used to connect the computers to the rest of the network. Coaxial
cable uses BNC connectors, sometimes called “British Naval Connectors” or “Bayonet
Neill-Concelman” connectors, at the ends of the cables to make the connection. Several
types of coaxial cable exist:
■Thicknet (10BASE5) is coaxial cable that was used in networks and operated at 10
Mbps, with a maximum length of 500 meters.
■Thinnet (10BASE2) is coaxial cable that was used in networks and operated at 10
Mbps, with a maximum length of 185 meters.
■RG-59 is most commonly used for cable television in the U.S.
■RG-6 is higher-quality cable than RG-59, with more bandwidth and less susceptibility
to interference.
Fiber-Optic Cable
An optical fiber is a glass or plastic conductor that transmits information using light. Fiber-
optic cable, shown in Figure 8-18, has one or more optical fibers enclosed in a sheath or
jacket. Because it is made of glass, fiber-optic cable is not affected by EMI or RFI. All sig-
nals are converted to light pulses to enter the cable and are converted back into electrical
signals when they leave it. This means that fiber-optic cable can deliver signals that are
clearer, that can go farther, and that have greater bandwidth than cable made of copper or
other metals.
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks

Figure 8-18
Fiber-Optic Cabling
Fiber-optic cable can reach distances of several miles or kilometers before the signal needs
to be regenerated. Fiber-optic cable usually is more expensive to use than copper cable, and
the connectors are more costly and harder to assemble. Common connectors for fiber-optic
networks are SC, ST, and LC. These three types of fiber-optic connectors are half-duplex,
which allows data to flow in only one direction. Therefore, two cables are needed.
These are the two types of glass fiber-optic cable:
■Multimode is cable that has a thicker core than single-mode cable. It is easier to make,
can use simpler light sources (LEDs), and works well over distances of a few kilome-
ters or less.

■Single-mode is cable that has a very thin core. It is harder to make, uses lasers as a
light source, and can transmit signals dozens of kilometers with ease.
A fiber-optic cable is one or more optical fibers enclosed together in a sheath or jacket.
Describe LAN Topologies and Architectures
Most of the computers that you work on will be part of a network. Topologies and architec-
tures are building blocks for designing a computer network. Although you may not build a
computer network, you need to understand how they are designed so that you can work on
computers that are part of a network.
The two types of LAN topologies are physical and logical. A physical topology, shown in
Figure 8-19, is the physical layout of the components on the network. A logical topology,
shown in Figure 8-20, determines how the hosts communicate across a medium, such as a
cable or the airwaves. Topologies commonly are represented as network diagrams.
Figure 8-19
Physical Topology
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
29
A LAN architecture is built around a topology. A LAN architecture comprises all the com-
ponents that make up the structure of a communications system. These components include
the hardware, software, protocols, and sequence of operations.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:

Describe LAN Topologies
A physical topology defines the way in which computers, printers, and other devices are
connected to a network. A logical topology describes how the hosts access the medium and
communicates on the network. The type of topology, as shown in Figure 8-21, determines
the network’s capabilities, such as ease of setup, speed, and cable lengths.
Figure 8-21
LAN Physical Topologies

Physical Topologies
The common LAN physical topologies are as follows:
■Bus topology: In the bus topology, each computer connects to a common cable. The
cable connects one computer to the next, like a bus line going through a city. The cable
has a small cap installed at the end, called a terminator. The terminator prevents signals
from bouncing back and causing network errors.
■Ring topology: In a ring topology, hosts are connected in a physical ring or circle.
Because the ring topology has no beginning or end, the cable does not need to be ter-
minated. A specially formatted frame, called a token, travels around the ring, stopping
at each host. If a host wants to transmit data, it adds the data and the destination
address to the frame. The frame then continues around the ring until it stops at the host
with the destination address. The destination host takes the data out of the frame.
■Star topology: The star topology has a central connection point, which normally is a
device such as a hub, switch, or router. Each host on a network has a cable segment
that attaches the host directly to the central connection point. The advantage of a star
topology is that it is easy to troubleshoot. Each host is connected to the central device
with its own wire. If there is a problem with that cable, only that host is affected. The
rest of the network remains operational.
■Hierarchical or extended star topology: A hierarchical or extended star topology is a
star network with an additional networking device connected to the main networking
device. Typically, a network cable connects to one hub, and then several other hubs
connect to the first hub. Larger networks, such as those of corporations or universities,
use the hierarchical star topology.
■Mesh topology: The mesh topology connects all devices to each other. When every
device is connected to every other device, a failure of any cable does not affect the net-
work. The mesh topology is used in WANs that interconnect LANs.
Logical Topologies
The two most common types of logical topologies are broadcast and token passing.
In a broadcast topology, each host addresses data to either a particular host or to all hosts
connected on a network. There is no order that the hosts must follow to use the network. It
is first come, first served for transmitting data on the network.
Token passing controls network access by passing an electronic token sequentially to each
host. When a host receives the token, it can send data on the network. If the host has no
data to send, it passes the token to the next host, and the process repeats.

A LAN architecture describes both the physical and logical topologies used in a network.

Ethernet
The Ethernet architecture is based on the IEEE 802.3 standard. The IEEE 802.3 standard
specifies that a network must use the carrier sense multiple access collision detect
(CSMA/CD) access control method. In CSMA/CD, hosts access the network using the first-
come, first-served broadcast topology method to transmit data.
Ethernet uses a logical bus or broadcast topology and either a bus or star physical topology.
As networks expand, most Ethernet networks are implemented using an extended star or
hierarchical star topology. Standard transfer rates are 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps, but new stan-
dards outline Gigabit Ethernet, which can attain speeds of up to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps).
Token Ring
IBM originally developed Token Ring as a reliable network architecture based on the
token-passing access control method. Token Ring is used with computers and mainframes.
Token Ring is an example of an architecture in which the physical topology is different
from its logical topology. The Token Ring topology is called a star-wired ring because the
outer appearance of the network design is a star. The computers connect to a central hub,
called a multistation access unit (MSAU). Inside the device, however, the wiring forms a
circular data path, creating a logical ring. The logical ring is created by the token traveling
out of an MSAU port to a computer. If the computer does not have any data to send, the
token is sent back to the MSAU port and then out the next port to the next computer. This
process continues for all computers and therefore resembles a physical ring.

FDDI
FDDI is a type of Token Ring network. The implementation and topology of FDDI differs
from the IBM Token Ring LAN architecture. FDDI is often used to connect several build-
ings in an office complex or on a university campus.
FDDI runs on fiber-optic cable. FDDI combines high-speed performance with the advan-
tages of the token-passing ring topology. FDDI runs at 100 Mbps on a dual-ring topology.
The outer ring is called the primary ring, and the inner ring is called the secondary ring.
Normally, traffic flows on only the primary ring. If the primary ring fails, the data automati-
cally flows onto the secondary ring in the opposite direction.
An FDDI dual ring supports a maximum of 500 computers per ring. The total distance of
each length of the cable ring is 62 miles (100 km). A repeater, which is a device that regen-
erates signals, is required every 1.2 miles (2 km). In recent years, many Token Ring net-
works have been replaced by faster Ethernet networks.
Identify Standards Organizations
Several worldwide standards organizations are responsible for setting networking standards.
Manufacturers use standards as a basis for developing technology, especially communica-
tions and networking technologies. Standardizing technology ensures that the devices you
use are compatible with other devices using the same technology. Standards groups create,
examine, and update standards. These standards are applied to the development of technology
to meet the demands for higher bandwidth, efficient communication, and reliable service.
Here is a list of standards organizations:
■IEEE: The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers is a nonprofit technical pro-
fessional association of more than 377,000 members in 150 countries. Founded in
1884, the organization is composed of engineers, scientists, and students. Through its
members, the IEEE is a leading authority in technical areas ranging from computer
engineering, biomedical technology, and telecommunications to electric power, aero-
space, and consumer electronics.
■ISO: The International Organization for Standardization is an international organiza-
tion composed of national standards bodies from more than 140 countries. The
American National Standards Institute (ANSI), for example, is a member of ISO. ISO
is a nongovernment organization established to promote the development of standardi-
zation and related activities. ISO’s work results in international agreements, which are
published as International Standards.
ISO has defined a number of important computer standards, the most significant of
which is perhaps the OSI model, a standardized architecture for designing networks.
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
33

ISO together with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) have built a strategic partnership with
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
■IAB: The Internet Architecture Board is the committee that oversees the technical and
engineering development of the Internet by the Internet Society (ISOC). The committee
oversees the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research Task
Force (IRTF). When the Internet transitioned to a public entity in 1992, the name was
changed to what it is today, the Internet Architecture Board, originally formed by the
U.S. Department of Defense.
■IEC: Founded in 1906, the International Electrotechnical Commission is the global
organization that prepares and publishes international standards for all electrical, elec-
tronic, and related technologies. The IEC was founded because of a resolution passed
at the International Electrical Congress held in St. Louis (U.S.) in 1904. The member-
ship consists of more than 60 participating countries, including all the world’s major
trading nations and a growing number of industrialized countries. The IEC’s mission is
to promote, through its members, international cooperation on all questions related to
electrotechnologies, electroacoustics, multimedia, telecommunications, and energy pro-
duction and distribution, as well as associated general disciplines such as terminology
and symbols, electromagnetic compatibility, design and development, safety, and the
environment.
The IEC is one of the bodies recognized by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
entrusted by it to monitor the national and regional organizations agreeing to use the
IEC’s international standards as the basis of national or regional standards as part of the
WTO’s Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement.
■ANSI: The American National Standards Institute is a private, nonprofit organization
that administers and coordinates the U.S. voluntary standardization and conformity
assessment system. ANSI identifies industrial and public requirements for national con-
sensus standards and coordinates and manages their development, resolves national
standards problems, and ensures effective participation in international standardization.
Since 1918, the institute’s mission has been to enhance both the global competitiveness
of U.S. business and quality of life by promoting and facilitating voluntary consensus
standards and conformity assessment systems and safeguarding their integrity.
ANSI does not develop standards itself. Rather, it facilitates development by establish-
ing consensus processes among qualified groups. This is why its acronym is seen on
many standards.
■TIA/EIA: The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and Electronic
Industries Association (EIA) are trade associations that jointly develop and publish a
series of standards covering structured voice and data wiring for LANs. These industry
34

standards evolved after the U.S. telephone industry deregulation in 1984, which trans-
ferred responsibility for on-premises cabling to the building owner. Before that, AT&T
used proprietary cables and systems. :
Identify Ethernet Standards
Ethernet protocols describe the rules that control how communication occurs on an Ethernet
network. To ensure that all Ethernet devices are compatible with each other, the IEEE
developed standards for manufacturers and programmers to follow when developing
Ethernet devices. Figure 8-22 shows an example of how different devices can communicate
using these standards.

■Explain cabled Ethernet standards.
■Explain wireless Ethernet standards.
Explain Cabled Ethernet Standards
The Ethernet architecture is based on the IEEE 802.3 standard. The IEEE 802.3 standard
specifies that a network must implement the CSMA/CD access control method.
In CSMA/CD, all end stations “listen” to the network wire for clearance to send data. This
process is similar to waiting to hear a dial tone on a phone before dialing a number. When
the end station detects that no other host is transmitting, it attempts to send data. If no other

station sends data at the same time, the transmission arrives at the destination computer
with no problems. If another end station observes the same clear signal and transmits at the
same time, a collision occurs on the network medium.
The first station that detects the collision, or the doubling of voltage, sends out a jam signal
that tells all stations to stop transmitting and to run a backoff algorithm. A backoff algo-
rithm calculates random times at which the end station retries the network transmission.
This random time typically is one or two milliseconds (ms), or thousandths of a second.
This sequence occurs every time a collision occurs on the network and can reduce Ethernet
transmission by up to 40 percent.
Ethernet Technologies
The IEEE 802.3 standard defines several physical implementations that support Ethernet.
Some of the common implementations are described here.
Ethernet
10BASE-T is an Ethernet technology that uses a star topology. 10BASE-T is a popular
Ethernet architecture whose features are indicated in its name:
■The 10 represents a speed of 10 Mbps.
■BASE represents baseband transmission. In baseband transmission, the entire band-
width of a cable is used for one type of signal.
■The T represents twisted-pair copper cabling.
The advantages of 10BASE-T are as follows:
■Installation of cable is inexpensive compared to fiber-optic installation.
■Cables are thin, flexible, and easier to install than coaxial cabling.
■Equipment and cables are easy to upgrade.
The disadvantages of 10BASE-T are as follows:
■The maximum length of a 10BASE-T segment is only 328 feet (100 m).
■Cables are susceptible to EMI. 
Fast Ethernet
The high-bandwidth demands of many modern applications, such as videoconferencing and
streaming audio, have created a need for higher data-transfer speeds. Many networks
require more bandwidth than 10 Mbps Ethernet.
100BASE-TX is much faster than 10BASE-T and has a theoretical bandwidth of 100 Mbps.
36
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

The advantages of 100BASE-TX are as follows:
■At 100 Mbps, transfer rates of 100BASE-TX are ten times that of 10BASE-T.
■100BASE-X uses twisted-pair cabling, which is inexpensive and easy to install.
The disadvantages of 100BASE-TX are as follows:
■The maximum length of a 100BASE-TX segment is only 328 feet (100 m).
■Cables are susceptible to EMI.
Gigabit Ethernet
1000BASE-T is commonly known as Gigabit Ethernet. Gigabit Ethernet is a LAN architecture.
The advantages of 1000BASE-T are as follows:
■The 1000BASE-T architecture supports data transfer rates of 1 Gbps. At 1 Gbps, it is ten
times faster than Fast Ethernet and 100 times faster than Ethernet. This increased speed
makes it possible to implement bandwidth-intensive applications, such as live video.
■The 1000BASE-T architecture is interoperable with 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX.
The disadvantages of 1000BASE-T are as follows:
■The maximum length of a 1000BASE-T segment is only 328 feet (100 m).
■It is susceptible to interference.
■Gigabit NICs and switches are expensive.
■Additional equipment is required.

Explain Wireless Ethernet Standards
IEEE 802.11 is the standard that specifies connectivity for wireless networks. IEEE 802.11,
or Wi-Fi, refers to the collective group of standards—802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and
802.11n. These protocols specify the frequencies, speeds, and other capabilities of the dif-
ferent Wi-Fi standards:
■802.11a: Devices conforming to the 802.11a standard allow WLANs to achieve data
rates as high as 54 Mbps. IEEE 802.11a devices operate in the 5-GHz radio frequency
range and within a maximum range of 150 feet (45.7 m).
■802.11b: 802.11b operates in the 2.4-GHz frequency range, with a maximum theoreti-
cal data rate of 11 Mbps. These devices operate within a maximum range of 300 feet
(91 m).
■802.11g: IEEE 802.11g provides the same theoretical maximum speed as 802.11a,
which is 54 Mbps, but operates in the same 2.4-GHz spectrum as 802.11b. Unlike
802.11a, 802.11g is backward-compatible with 802.11b. 802.11g also has a maximum
range of 300 feet (91 m).
■802.11n: 802.11n is a newer wireless standard that has a theoretical bandwidth of 540
Mbps and operates in either the 2.4-GHz or 5-GHz frequency range with a maximum
range of 984 feet (250 m).

Explain the OSI and TCP/IP Data Models
An architectural model is a common frame of reference for explaining Internet communica-
tions and developing communication protocols. It separates the functions of protocols into
manageable layers. Each layer performs a specific function in the process of communicat-
ing over a network.
The TCP/IP model was created by researchers in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).
The TCP/IP model is a tool used to help explain the TCP/IP suite of protocols, which is the
dominant standard for transporting data across networks. This model has four layers, as
shown in Table 8-5.

In the early 1980s, the ISO developed the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model,
which was defined in ISO standard 7498-1, to standardize how devices communicate on a
network. This model has seven layers, as shown in Table 8-5. This model was a major step
toward ensuring that network devices could interoperate.

The TCP/IP reference model provides a common frame of reference for developing the pro-
tocols used on the Internet. It consists of layers that perform functions necessary to prepare

A message begins at the top layer, the application layer, and moves down the TCP/IP layers
to the bottom layer, the network access layer. Header information is added to the message
as it moves down through each layer and then is transmitted. After reaching the destination,
the message travels back up through each layer of the TCP/IP model. The header informa-
tion that was added to the message is stripped away as the message moves up through the
layers toward its destination. 
Application Protocols
Application layer protocols provide network services to user applications such as web
browsers and e-mail programs. Here are some of the application protocols that operate at
the TCP/IP application layer:
■Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) governs how files such as text, graphics, sound,
and video are exchanged on the Internet or World Wide Web (WWW). HTTP is an
application layer protocol. A web server runs an HTTP service or daemon. A daemon is
a program that services HTTP requests. These requests are transmitted by HTTP client
software, which is another name for a web browser.
■Telnet is an application that you can use to access, control, and troubleshoot remote
computers and network devices.
■File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a set of rules governing how files are transferred. FTP
allows multiple simultaneous connections to remote file systems.
■Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) provides messaging services over TCP/IP
and supports most Internet e-mail programs.
■Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names, such as www.cisco.com, to IP
addresses.
■Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a page description language. Web designers
use HTML to indicate to web browser software how the page should look. HTML
includes tags to indicate boldface and italic type, line breaks, paragraph breaks, hyper-
links, and insertion of tables, among other instructions.

Transport Protocols
Transport layer protocols provide end-to-end management of the data. One of the functions
of these protocols is to divide the data into manageable segments for easier transport across
the network. Here are the two transport protocols that operate at the TCP/IP transport
layer:
■Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the primary Internet protocol for the reliable
delivery of data. TCP includes facilities for end-to-end connection establishment, error
detection and recovery, and metering the rate of data flow into the network. Many stan-
dard applications, such as e-mail, web browser, file transfer, and Telnet, depend on the
services of TCP.
■User Datagram Protocol (UDP) offers a connectionless service for delivery of data.
UDP uses lower overhead than TCP and doesn’t handle issues of reliability. Network
management applications, network file system, and simple file transport use UDP.
Internet Protocols
Internet layer protocols operate at the third layer from the top in the TCP/IP model. Internet
protocols are used to provide connectivity between hosts in the network. Here are some of
the protocols that operate at the TCP/IP Internet layer:
■Internet Protocol (IP) provides source and destination addressing, much like the
address and return address on a postal envelope. In conjunction with routing protocols,
IP provides packet-forwarding information from one network to another.
■Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used for network testing and trou-
bleshooting. It enables diagnostic and error messages. The ping application uses ICMP
echo messages to test if a remote device can be reached.
■Routing information Protocol (RIP) operates between router devices to discover paths
between networks. In an intranet, routers depend on a routing protocol to build and
maintain information about how to forward packets toward the destination. RIP choos-
es routes based on the distance or hop count to the destination.
■Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map the MAC address of a node on the
network when its IP address is known. End stations as well as routers use ARP to dis-
cover MAC addresses.
Network Access Protocols
Network access protocols describe the standards that hosts use to access the physical
media. The IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standards and technologies, such as CSMA/CD and
10BASE-T, are defined at this layer.

Define the OSI Model
The OSI model is an industry-standard framework that is used to divide network communi-
cations into seven distinct layers. Although other models exist, most network vendors today
build their products using this framework.
A system that implements protocol behavior consisting of a series of these layers is known
as a protocol stack. Protocol stacks can be implemented in either hardware or software, or a
combination of both. Typically, only the lower layers are implemented in hardware, and the
higher layers are implemented in software.
Each layer is responsible for part of the processing to prepare data for transmission on the
network. Table 8-7 describes each layer of the OSI model.

Defines all the electrical and physical specifications for
devices
In the OSI model, when data is transferred, it is said to virtually travel down the OSI model
layers of the sending computer and up the OSI model layers of the receiving computer.
When a user wants to send data, such as an e-mail, the encapsulation process starts at the
application layer. The application layer provides network access to applications.
Information flows through the top three layers and is considered to be data when it gets
down to the transport layer.
At the transport layer, the data is broken into more manageable segments, or transport layer
protocol data units (PDU), for orderly transport across the network. A PDU describes data
as it moves from one layer of the OSI model to another. The transport layer PDU also con-
tains information such as port numbers, sequence numbers, and acknowledgment numbers,
which is used for reliable data transport.
42
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

At the network layer, each segment from the transport layer becomes a packet. The packet
contains logical addressing and other Layer 3 control information.
At the data link layer, each packet from the network layer becomes a frame. The frame con-
tains physical address and error-correction information.
At the physical layer, the frame becomes bits. These bits are transmitted one at a time
across the network medium.
At the receiving computer, the de-encapsulation process reverses the process of encapsula-
tion. The bits arrive at the physical layer of the OSI model of the receiving computer. The
process of virtually traveling up the OSI model of the receiving computer brings the data to
the application layer, where an e-mail program displays the e-mail.
Note
Mnemonics can help you remember the seven layers of the OSI. Two examples are “All People Seem
To Need Data Processing” and “Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away.”
Compare the OSI and TCP/IP Models
The OSI model and the TCP/IP model are both reference models used to describe the data
communication process. The TCP/IP model is used specifically for the TCP/IP suite of pro-
tocols. The OSI model is used to develop standard communication for equipment and appli-
cations from different vendors.
The TCP/IP model performs the same process as the OSI model, but it uses four layers
instead of seven. Figure 8-23 shows how the layers of the two models compare.

Describe How to Configure a NIC and a Modem
A network interface card (NIC) is required to connect to the Internet. The NIC may come
preinstalled, or you may have to purchase one. In rare cases, you may need to update the
NIC driver. You can use the driver disc that comes with the motherboard or adapter card, or
you can supply a driver that you downloaded from the manufacturer.
After the NIC and the driver have been installed, you can connect the computer to the net-
work.
In addition to installing a NIC, you may need to install a modem to connect to the Internet.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Install or update a NIC driver.
■Attach the computer to an existing network.
■Describe the installation of a modem.
Install or Update a NIC Driver
Sometimes a manufacturer publishes new driver software for a NIC. A new driver may
enhance the functionality of the NIC, or it may be needed for operating system compatibility.
When installing a new driver, be sure to disable virus protection software so that none of
the files is incorrectly installed. Some virus scanners detect a driver update as a possible
virus attack. Also, only one driver should be installed at a time; otherwise, some updating
processes may conflict.
A best practice is to close all applications that are running so that they do not use any files
associated with the driver update. Before updating a driver, you should visit the manufactur-
er’s website. In many cases, you can download a self-extracting executable driver file that
automatically installs or updates the driver. Alternatively, you can click the Update Driver
button in the Device Manager toolbar.
The + next to the Network adapters category allows you to expand the category and show
the network adapters installed in your system. To view and change the adapter’s properties,
or update the driver, double-click the adapter. In the adapter properties window, click the
Driver tab. Figure 8-24 shows an example of a network card adapter properties page in
Device Manager.
When the update is complete, it is a good idea to reboot the computer, even if you do not
receive a message telling you to do so. Rebooting the computer ensures that the installation
has gone as planned and that the new driver is working properly. When installing multiple
drivers, reboot the computer between each update to make sure that no conflicts exist. This
step takes extra time but ensures a clean installation of the driver.

Uninstall a NIC Driver
If a new NIC driver does not perform as expected after it has been installed, the driver can
be uninstalled, or rolled back, to the previous driver. Double-click the adapter in the Device
Manager. In the Adapter Properties window, click the Driver tab, and click Roll Back
Driver. If no driver was installed before the update, this option is unavailable. In that case,
you need to find a driver for the device and install it manually if the operating system can-
not find a suitable driver for the NIC.
Worksheet 8.9.1: Internet Search for NIC Drivers
In this worksheet you research NIC drivers. Refer to the worksheet in IT Essentials: PC
Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You may perform this work-
sheet now or wait until the end of the chapter.
Attach the Computer to an Existing Network
Now that the NIC drivers are installed, you are ready to connect to the network. Plug a net-
work cable, also called an Ethernet patch or straight-through cable, into the network port on
the computer. Plug the other end into the network device or wall jack.
After connecting the network cable, look at the LEDs, or link lights, next to the Ethernet
port on the NIC to see if any activity is occurring. If no activity is going on, this may
indicate a faulty cable, a faulty hub port, or even a faulty NIC. You may have to replace one
or more of these devices to correct the problem.

After you have confirmed that the computer is connected to the network and that the link
lights on the NIC indicate a working connection, the computer needs an IP address. Most
networks are set up so that the computer receives an IP address automatically from a local
DHCP server. If the computer does not have an IP address, you need to enter a unique IP
address in the TCP/IP properties of the NIC.
Every NIC must be configured with the following information:
■Protocols: The same protocol must be implemented between any two computers that
communicate on the same network.
■IP address: This address can be configured and must be unique to each device. The IP
address can be manually configured or automatically assigned by DHCP.
■MAC address: Each device has a unique MAC address. The MAC address is assigned
by the manufacturer and cannot be changed.
After the computer is connected to the network, you should test connectivity with the ping
command. Use the ipconfig command to find out what your IP address is. Example 8-3
shows sample output from the ipconfig /all command.

Ping your own IP address to make sure that your NIC is working properly. After you have
determined that your NIC is working, ping your default gateway or another computer on
your network, as shown in Example 8-4. A default gateway allows a host to communicate
outside your network. If you have an Internet connection, ping a popular website, such as
www.cisco.com. If you can successfully ping an Internet site or another computer on your
network, everything is working properly with your connection. If you cannot ping one of
these, you need to troubleshoot the connection.

Describe the Installation of a Modem
A modem, shown in Figure 8-25, is an electronic device that transfers data between one
computer and another using analog signals over a telephone line. The modem converts digi-
tal data to analog signals for transmission. The modem at the receiving end reconverts the
analog signals to digital data to be interpreted by the computer. The process of converting
analog signals to digital and back again is called modulation/demodulation. Modem-based
transmission is very accurate, despite the fact that telephone lines can be noisy because of
clicks, static, and other problems.

Figure 8-25
Modems
48
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
An internal modem plugs into an expansion slot on the motherboard. To configure a
modem, jumpers may have to be set to select the IRQ and I/O addresses. No configuration
is needed for a “plug-and-play” modem, which can only be installed on a motherboard that
supports plug and play. A modem using a serial port that is not yet in use must be config-
ured. Additionally, the software drivers that come with the modem must be installed for the
modem to work properly. Drivers for modems are installed the same way drivers are
installed for NICs.
External modems connect to a computer through the serial and USB ports.
When computers use the public telephone system to communicate, this is called dialup net-
working (DUN). Modems communicate with each other using audio tone signals. This
means that modems can duplicate the dialing characteristics of a telephone. DUN creates a
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connection between two computers over a phone line.
After the line connection has been established, a “handshaking sequence” takes place
between the two modems and the computers. The handshaking sequence is a series of short
communications that occur between the two systems. This is done to establish the readiness
of the two modems and computers to engage in data exchange. Dialup modems send data
over the serial telephone line in the form of an analog signal. Because the analog signals
change gradually and continuously, they can be drawn as waves. In this system, the digital
signals are represented by 1s and 0s. The digital signals must be converted to a waveform to
travel across telephone lines. The receiving modem converts them back to digital form, 1s
and 0s, so that the receiving computer can process the data. 

AT Commands
All modems require software to control the communication session. Most modem software
uses the Hayes-compatible command set. The Hayes command set is based on a group of
instructions that always begins with a set of attention (AT) characters, followed by the com-
mand characters. These are known as AT commands. Table 8-8 shows the AT command set.
Table 8-8
AT Commands

The AT commands are modem control commands. The AT command set is used to issue
dial, hang-up, reset, and other instructions to the modem. Most user manuals that come with
a modem contain a complete listing of the AT command set. 
The standard Hayes-compatible code to dial is ATDxxxxxxx. An AT string usually has no
spaces. If a space is inserted, most modems ignore it. The x signifies the number dialed. A
local call has seven digits, and a long-distance call has 11 digits. A W indicates that the
modem will wait for an outside line, if necessary, to establish a tone before proceeding.
Sometimes, a T is added to signify tone dialing, or a P is added to signify pulse dialing.
Identify the Names, Purposes, and
Characteristics of Other Technologies Used to
Establish Connectivity
There are many ways to connect to the Internet. Phone, cable, satellite, and private telecom-
munications companies offer Internet connections for businesses and home use.
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
49

In the 1990s, the Internet typically was used for data transfer. Transmission speeds were
slow compared to the high-speed connections that are available today. Most Internet con-
nections were analog modems that used the plain old telephone system (POTS) to send and
receive data. In recent years, many businesses and home users have switched to high-speed
Internet connections. The additional bandwidth allows for transmission of voice and video
as well as data.
You should understand how users connect to the Internet and the advantages and disadvan-
tages of different connection types.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe telephone technologies.
■Define power line communication.
■Define broadband.
■Define VOIP.
Describe Telephone Technologies
Several WAN solutions are available for connecting between sites or to the Internet. WAN
connection services provide different speeds and levels of service. Before committing to
any type of Internet connection, research all the available services to determine the best
solution to meet the customer’s needs.
Analog Telephone
Analog telephone technology uses standard voice telephone lines. This type of service uses
a modem to place a telephone call to another modem at a remote site, such as an Internet
service provider (ISP). Using the phone line with an analog modem has two major disad-
vantages. The first is that the telephone line cannot be used for voice calls while the modem
is in use. The second is the limited bandwidth provided by analog phone service. The maxi-
mum bandwidth using an analog modem is 56 Kbps, but in reality, it usually is much lower
than that. An analog modem is not a good solution for the demands of busy networks.
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
The next advancement in WAN service is ISDN. ISDN is a standard for sending voice,
video, and data over normal telephone wires. ISDN technology uses the telephone wires as
an analog telephone service. However, ISDN uses digital technology to carry the data.
Because it uses digital technology, ISDN provides higher-quality voice and higher-speed
data transfer than traditional analog telephone service.
ISDN digital connections offer three services: Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate
Interface (PRI), and Broadband ISDN (BISDN). ISDN uses two different types of
50
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

communication channels. The B channel is used to carry the information—data, voice, or
video. The D channel usually is used for controlling and signaling, but it can be used for
data.
Here are the types of ISDN:
■BRI: ISDN Basic Rate Interface offers a dedicated 128-Kbps connection using two 64-
Kbps B channels. ISDN BRI also uses one 16-Kbps D channel for call setup, control,
and teardown.
■PRI: ISDN Primary Rate Interface offers up to 1.544 Mbps over 23 B channels in
North America and Japan or 2.048 Mbps over 30 B channels in Europe and Australia.
ISDN PRI also uses one 64-Kbps D channel for call maintenance.
■BISDN: Broadband ISDN manages different types of service all at the same time.
BISDN is mostly used only in network backbones.
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
DSL is an “always-on” technology. This means that you don’t need to dial up each time to
connect to the Internet. DSL uses the existing copper telephone lines to provide high-speed
digital data communication between end users and telephone companies. Unlike ISDN, in
which digital data communication replaces analog voice communication, DSL shares the
telephone wire with analog signals.
The telephone company limits the bandwidth of the analog voice on the lines. This limit
allows the DSL to place digital data on the phone wire in the unused portion of the band-
width. This sharing of the phone wire allows voice calls to be placed while DSL is connect-
ing to the Internet.
You must consider two major points when selecting DSL. DSL has distance limitations.
The phone lines used with DSL were designed to carry analog information. Therefore, the
length that the digital signal can be sent is limited, and the signal cannot pass through any
form of multiplexer used with analog phone lines. The other consideration is that the voice
information and the data carried by DSL must be separated at the customer site. A device
called a splitter separates the connection to the phones and the connection to the local net-
work devices.
Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) is currently the most commonly used DSL tech-
nology. ADSL has different bandwidth capabilities in each direction. ADSL has a fast
downstream speed—typically 1.5 Mbps. Downstream is the process of transferring data
from the server to the end user. This is beneficial to users who download large amounts of
data. The high-speed upload rate of ADSL is slower. ADSL does not perform well when
hosting a web server or FTP server, both of which involve upload-intensive Internet
activities.
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
51

The following are some of the most common DSL types:
■ADSL: Asymmetric DSL currently is the most common implementation. It has speeds
that vary from 384 Kbps to more than 6 Mbps downstream. The upstream speed typi-
cally is lower.
■HDSL: High Data Rate DSL provides equal bandwidth in both directions. It is 1.544
Mbps in North America and 2.048 Mbps in Europe.
■SDSL: Symmetric DSL provides the same speed, up to 3 Mbps, for uploads and down-
loads.
■VDSL: Very High Data Rate DSL is capable of bandwidths between 13 and 52 Mbps
downstream and 16 Mbps upstream.
■IDSL: ISDN DSL is actually DSL over ISDN lines. It is a set of CCIT/ITU standards
for digital transmission over ordinary telephone copper wire, as well as over other
media, with a top speed of 144 Kbps. ISDN is available in areas that do not qualify for
other DSL implementations. An ISDN adapter at both the user side and service
provider side is required. ISDN generally is available in urban areas in the U.S. and
Europe from the local phone company. 
Define Power Line Communication
Power line communication (PLC) is a communication method that uses power distribution
wires (the local electric grid) to send and receive data, as shown in Figure 8-26.
Figure 8-26
Power Line Communication
52
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

PLC is known by other names:
■Power Line Networking (PLN)
■Mains communication
■Power Line Telecom (PLT)
With PLC, an electric company can superimpose an analog signal over the standard 50- or
60-Hz AC that travels in power lines. The analog signal can carry voice and data signals.
PLC may be available in areas where other high-speed connections are not. PLC is faster
than an analog modem and may cost much less than other high-speed connection types. As
this technology matures, it will become more common to find and may increase in speed.
You can use PLC to network computers within your home instead of installing network
cabling or wireless technology. PLC connections can be used anywhere there is an electrical
outlet. You can control lighting and appliances using PLC without installing control wiring.
Define Broadband
Broadband is a technique used to transmit and receive multiple signals using multiple fre-
quencies over one cable. For example, the cable used to bring cable television to your home
can carry computer network transmissions at the same time. Because the two transmission
types use different frequencies, they do not interfere with each other.
Broadband is a signaling method that uses a wide range of frequencies that can be further
divided into channels. In networking, the term broadband describes communication meth-
ods that transmit two or more signals at the same time. Sending two or more signals simul-
taneously increases the rate of transmission. Some common broadband network connections
include cable, DSL, ISDN, and satellite.
Cable
A cable modem connects your computer to the cable company using the same coaxial cable
that connects to your cable television. You can plug your computer directly into the cable
modem, or you can connect a router, switch, hub, or multipurpose network device so that
multiple computers can share the connection to the Internet.
DSL
With DSL, the voice and data signals are carried on different frequencies on the copper
telephone wires. A filter is used to prevent DSL signals from interfering with phone signals.
Plug the filter into a phone jack, and plug the phone into the filter.
The DSL modem does not require a filter. The DSL modem is unaffected by the telephone
frequencies. Like a cable modem, a DSL modem can connect directly to your computer, or
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
53

it can be connected to a networking device to share the Internet connection with multiple
computers.
ISDN
ISDN is another example of broadband. ISDN uses multiple channels and can carry differ-
ent types of services; therefore, it is considered a type of broadband. ISDN can carry voice,
video, and data.
Satellite
Broadband satellite is an alternative for customers who cannot get cable or DSL connec-
tions. A satellite connection does not require a phone line or cable; it uses a satellite dish
for two-way communication. Download speeds typically are up to 500 Kbps; uploads are
closer to 56 Kbps. It takes time for the signal from the satellite dish to be relayed to your
ISP through the satellite orbiting the Earth.
People who live in rural areas often use satellite broadband because they need a faster con-
nection than dialup, and no other broadband connection is available. 
Worksheet 8.10.3: Answer Broadband Questions
In this worksheet you identify the different types of broadband. Refer to the worksheet in IT
Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You may per-
form this worksheet now or wait until the end of the chapter.
Define VoIP
Voice over IP (VoIP) is a method to carry telephone calls over the data networks and
Internet. VoIP converts the analog signals of our voices into digital information that is trans-
ported in IP packets. VoIP can also use an existing IP network to provide access to the pub-
lic switched telephone network (PSTN).
When using VoIP, you are dependent on an Internet connection. This can be a disadvantage
if the Internet connection experiences an interruption in service. When a service interrup-
tion occurs, the user cannot make phone calls.
Figure 8-27 shows some examples of VoIP phones.

Identify and Apply Common Preventive
Maintenance Techniques Used for Networks
Certain common preventive maintenance techniques should continually be performed for a
network to operate properly. If an organization has one malfunctioning computer, generally
only one user is affected. But if the network is malfunctioning, many or all users will be
unable to work.
One of the biggest problems with network devices, especially in the server room, is heat.
Network devices, such as computers, hubs, and switches, do not perform well when they
overheat. Often, excess heat is generated by accumulated dust and dirty air filters. When
dust gathers in and on network devices, it impedes the flow of cool air and sometimes even
clogs fans. It is important to keep network rooms clean and to change air filters often. It is
also a good idea to have replacement filters available for prompt maintenance.
Preventive maintenance involves checking a network’s various components for wear. Check
the condition of network cables, because they are often moved, unplugged, and kicked.
Many network problems can be traced to a faulty cable. You should replace any cables that
have exposed wires, that are badly twisted, or that are bent.
Label your cables. This practice will save troubleshooting time later. Refer to wiring dia-
grams, and always follow your company’s cable-labeling guidelines.
Troubleshoot a Network
Network issues can be simple or complex. To assess how complicated the problem is, you
should determine how many computers on the network are experiencing the problem.

If there is a problem with one computer on the network, start the troubleshooting process at
that computer. If there is a problem with all computers on the network, start the trou-
bleshooting process in the network room where all computers are connected. As a techni-
cian, you should develop a logical and consistent method for diagnosing network problems
by eliminating one problem at a time.
Follow the steps outlined in this section to accurately identify, repair, and document the
problem. The troubleshooting process is as follows:
Step 1.
Gather data from the customer.
Step 2.
Verify the obvious issues.
Step 3.
Try quick solutions first.
Step 4.
Gather data from the computer.
Step 5.
Evaluate the problem and implement the solution.
Step 6.
Close with the customer.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Review the troubleshooting process.
■Identify common network problems and solutions.
Review the Troubleshooting Process
Network problems can result from a combination of hardware, software, and connectivity
issues. Computer technicians must be able to analyze the problem and determine the cause
of the error to repair the network issue. This process is called troubleshooting. 
The first step in the troubleshooting process is to gather data from the customer. Here are
some open-ended questions to ask the customer:
■What problems are you experiencing with your computer or network?
■What software has been installed on your computer recently?
■What were you doing when the problem was identified?
■What error messages have you received on your computer?
■What type of network connection is the computer using?
Here are some closed-ended questions to ask the customer:
■Has anyone else used your computer recently?
■Can you see any shared files or printers?
■Have you changed your password recently?
56
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
How To

■Can you access the Internet?
■Are you currently logged into the network?
After you have talked to the customer, you should verify the obvious issues for networks:
■Loose cable connections
■Improperly installed NIC
■Check the NIC link lights
■Low wireless signal strength
■Invalid IP address
After you have checked the obvious issues, try some quick solutions for networks:
■Check that all cables are connected to the proper locations.
■Unseat and then reconnect cables and connectors.
■Reboot the computer or network device.
■Log in as a different user.
■Repair or reenable the network connection.
■Contact the network administrator.
If quick solutions do not correct the problem, it is time to gather data from the computer.
Here are some different ways to gather information about the problem from the network:
■Ping is used to check network connectivity. It sends a packet to the specified address
and waits for a reply.
■Nslookup is used to query Internet domain name servers. It returns a list of hosts in a
domain or the information for one host. 
■Tracert is used to determine the route taken by packets when they travel across the net-
work. It shows where communications between your computer and another computer
are having difficulty.
■Net View displays a list of computers in a workgroup. It shows the available shared
resources on a network.
At this point, you have enough information to evaluate the problem and then research and
implement possible solutions. Here are some resources for possible solutions:
■Problem-solving experience
■Other technicians
■Internet search
■Newsgroups
Chapter 8: Fundamental Networks
57

■Manufacturer FAQs
■Computer manuals
■Device manuals
■Online forums
■Technical websites
After you have solved the network problem, you close with the customer. Here are some of
the tasks required to complete this step:
■Discuss the solution implemented with the customer.
■Have the customer verify that the problem has been solved.
■Provide the customer with all the paperwork.
■Document the steps taken to solve the problem in the work order and the technician’s
journal. 
■Document any components used in the repair.
■Document the time spent to resolve the problem.
Identify Common Network Problems and Solutions
Network problems can be attributed to hardware, software, connectivity issues, or some
combination of the three. You will resolve some types of network problems more often than
others. Table 8-9 is a chart of common network problems and solutions.

Summary
This chapter introduced you to the fundamentals of networking, the benefits of having a
network, and the ways to connect computers to a network. The different aspects of trou-
bleshooting a network were discussed, with examples of how to analyze and implement
simple solutions. The following concepts from this chapter are important to remember:
■A computer network is composed of two or more computers that share data and
resources.
■A local-area network (LAN) is a group of interconnected computers that are under the
same administrative control.
■A wide-area network (WAN) connects LANs in geographically separated locations.
■In a peer-to-peer network, devices are connected directly to each other. A peer-to-peer
network is easy to install, and no additional equipment or dedicated administrator is
required.
■The network topology defines how computers, printers, and other devices are connect-
ed. The physical topology describes the layout of the wire and devices, as well as the
paths used by data transmissions. The logical topology is the path that signals travel
from one point to another. Topologies include bus, star, ring, and mesh.
■Networking media can be defined as the means by which signals, or data, are sent from
one computer to another. Signals can be transmitted by either cable or wireless means.
The media types discussed were coaxial cable, twisted-pair cable, fiber-optic cable, and
radio frequencies.
■Ethernet architecture is currently the most popular type of LAN architecture.
■The OSI reference model is an industry-standard framework that is used to divide net-
working functions into seven distinct layers: application, presentation, session, trans-
port, network, data link, and physical. It is important to understand the purpose of each
layer.
■The TCP/IP suite of protocols has become the dominant standard for the Internet.
■A NIC is a device that plugs into a motherboard and provides ports for the network
cable connections. It is the computer interface with the LAN.
■The three transmission methods for sending signals over data channels are simplex,
half duplex, and full duplex. Full-duplex networking technology increases performance
because data can be sent and received at the same time. DSL, two-way cable modem,
and other broadband technologies operate in full-duplex mode.
■It is important to clean equipment regularly and to use a proactive approach to prevent
problems.

60
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
■When troubleshooting network problems, listen to what your customer tells you so that
you can formulate open-ended and closed-ended questions that will help you determine
where to begin fixing the problem. Verify obvious issues, and try quick solutions before
escalating the troubleshooting process.

Technicians need to understand computer and network security. Failure to implement proper
security procedures can affect users, computers, and the general public. Private information,
company secrets, financial data, computer equipment, and items of national security are
placed at risk if proper security procedures are not followed.
Explain Why Security Is Important
Computer and network security help keep data and equipment safe by giving only the
appropriate people access. Everyone in an organization should give high priority to security,
because everyone can be affected by a lapse in security.
Theft, loss, network intrusion, and physical damage are some of the ways a network or
computer can be harmed. Damage or loss of equipment can mean a loss of productivity.
Repairing and replacing equipment can cost the company time and money. Unauthorized
use of a network can expose confidential information and reduce network resources.
An attack that intentionally degrades the performance of a computer or network can also
harm an organization’s production. Poorly implemented security measures that allow unau-
thorized access to wireless network devices demonstrate that physical connectivity is not
necessary for security breaches by intruders.
A technician’s primary responsibilities include data and network security. A customer or an
organization may depend on you to ensure that their data and computer equipment are
secure. You will perform tasks that are more sensitive than those assigned to the average
employee. You may have to repair, adjust, and install equipment. You need to know how to
configure settings to keep the network secure, but still keep it available to those who need
to access it. You will ensure that software patches and updates are applied, antivirus soft-
ware is installed, and antispyware software is used. You may also be asked to instruct users
on how to maintain good security practices with computer equipment.
Worksheet 9.1.0: Security Attacks
In this activity, you use the Internet, a newspaper, or magazines to gather information to
help you become familiar with computer crime and security attacks in your area. Be pre-
pared to discuss your research with the class. Refer to the worksheet in IT Essentials: PC
Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You may complete this work-
sheet now or wait to do so until the end of the chapter.

Describe Security Threats
To successfully protect computers and the network, a technician must understand both of
the following types of threats to computer security:
■Physical: Events or attacks that steal, damage, or destroy such equipment as servers,
switches, and wiring.
■Data: Events or attacks that remove, corrupt, deny access to, allow access to, or steal
information.
Threats to security can come from inside or outside an organization, and the level of poten-
tial damage can vary greatly. Potential threats include the following:
■Internal: Employees who have access to data, equipment, and the network. Internal
attacks can be characterized as follows:
■Malicious threats are when an employee intends to cause damage.
■Accidental threats are when the user damages data or equipment unintentionally.
■External: Users outside an organization who do not have authorized access to the net-
work or resources. External attacks can be characterized as follows:
■Unstructured attacks, which use available resources, such as passwords or scripts,
to gain access to and run programs designed to vandalize.
■Structured attacks, which use code to access operating systems and software.
Physical loss or damage to equipment can be expensive, and data loss can be detrimental to
your business and reputation. Threats against data are constantly changing as attackers find
new ways to gain entry and commit their crimes.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Define viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.
■Explain web security.
■Define adware, spyware, and grayware.
■Explain denial of service.
■Describe spam and popups.
■Explain social engineering.
■Explain TCP/IP attacks.
■Explain hardware deconstruction and recycling.

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Define Viruses, Worms, and Trojan Horses
Computer viruses are created with malicious intent and sent by attackers. A virus is
attached to small pieces of computer code, software, or documents. The virus executes
when the software is run on a computer. If the virus spreads to other computers, those com-
puters could continue to spread the virus.
A virus is transferred to another computer through e-mail, file transfers, and instant messag-
ing. The virus hides by attaching itself to a file on the computer. When the file is accessed,
the virus executes and infects the computer. A virus has the potential to corrupt or even
delete files on your computer, use your e-mail to spread itself to other computers, or even
erase your hard drive.
Some viruses can be exceptionally dangerous. The most damaging type of virus is used to
record keystrokes. Attackers can use these viruses to harvest sensitive information, such as
passwords and credit card numbers. Viruses may even alter or destroy information on a
computer. Stealth viruses can infect a computer and lay dormant until summoned by the
attacker.
A worm is a self-replicating program that is harmful to networks. A worm uses the network
to duplicate its code to the hosts on a network, often without any user intervention. It is dif-
ferent from a virus because a worm does not need to attach to a program to infect a host.
Even if the worm does not damage data or applications on the hosts it infects, it harms net-
works because it consumes bandwidth.
A Trojan horse technically is a worm. It does not need to be attached to other software.
Instead, a Trojan threat is hidden in software that appears to do one thing, and yet behind
the scenes it does another. Trojans often are disguised as useful software. The Trojan pro-
gram can reproduce like a virus and spread to other computers. Computer data damage and
production loss could be significant. A technician may be needed to perform the repairs,
and employees may lose or have to replace data. An infected computer could be sending
critical data to competitors while at the same time infecting other computers on the net-
work.
Virus protection software, known as antivirus software, is software designed to detect, dis-
able, and remove viruses, worms, and Trojans before they infect a computer. Antivirus soft-
ware becomes outdated quickly, however. The technician is responsible for applying the
most recent updates, patches, and virus definitions as part of a regular maintenance sched-
ule. Many organizations establish a written security policy stating that employees are not
permitted to install any software that is not provided by the company. Organizations also
make employees aware of the dangers of opening e-mail attachments that may contain a
virus or worm.

Worksheet 9.2.1: Third-Party Antivirus Software
In this activity, you use the Internet, a newspaper, or a local store to gather information
about third-party antivirus software. Refer to the worksheet in IT Essentials: PC Hardware
and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You may complete this worksheet now
or wait to do so until the end of the chapter.
Explain Web Security
Web security is important because so many people visit the World Wide Web every day.
Some of the features that make the web useful and entertaining can also make it harmful to
a computer.
Tools that are used to make web pages more powerful and versatile can also make comput-
ers more vulnerable to attacks. Here are some examples of web tools:
■ActiveX is technology created by Microsoft to control interactivity on web pages. If
ActiveX is on a page, the user must download an applet or small program to gain
access to the full functionality.
■Java is a programming language that allows applets to run within a web browser.
Examples of applets include a calculator and a counter.
■JavaScript is a programming language developed to interact with HTML source code
to allow interactive websites. Examples include a rotating banner and a popup window.
Attackers can use any of these tools to install a program on a computer. To protect against
these attacks, most browsers have settings that force the computer user to authorize the
downloading or use of ActiveX, Java, and JavaScript.
Define Adware, Spyware, and Grayware
Adware, spyware, and grayware are usually installed on a computer without the user’s
knowledge. These programs collect information stored on the computer, change the com-
puter configuration, or open extra windows on the computer without the user’s consent.
Adware is a software program that displays advertising on your computer. Adware is usual-
ly distributed with downloaded software. Most often, adware is displayed in a popup win-
dow. Adware popup windows are sometimes difficult to control; they open new windows
faster than users can close them.
Grayware or malware is a file or program other than a virus that is potentially harmful.
Many grayware attacks are phishing attacks, which try to persuade the user to unknowingly
give attackers access to personal information. As you fill out an online form, the data is sent
to the attacker. Grayware can be removed using spyware and adware removal tools.
6
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Spyware, a type of grayware, is similar to adware. It is distributed without any user inter-
vention or knowledge. After it is installed, the spyware monitors activity on the computer.
The spyware then sends this information to the organization responsible for launching the
spyware.
Phishing is a form of social engineering, in which the attacker pretends to represent a legit-
imate outside organization, such as a bank. A potential victim is contacted via e-mail. The
attacker might ask for verification of information, such as a password or username, to sup-
posedly prevent some terrible consequence from occurring.
Note
There is rarely a need to give out sensitive personal or financial information online. Be suspicious.
Use the postal service to share sensitive information.
Explain Denial of Service
Denial of service (DoS) is a form of attack that prevents users from accessing normal serv-
ices, such as e-mail or a web server. DoS works by sending so many requests for a system
resource that the requested service is overloaded and ceases to operate.
DoS attacks can affect servers and computers in the following ways:
■Ping of death is a series of repeated, larger-than-normal pings that are intended to
crash the receiving computer.
■An e-mail bomb is a large quantity of bulk e-mail sent to individuals, lists, or domains,
intending to prevent users from accessing e-mail.
Distributed DoS (DDoS) is another form of attack that uses many infected computers,
called zombies, to launch an attack. With DDoS, the intent is to obstruct or overwhelm
access to the targeted server. Zombie computers located at different geographic locations
make it difficult to trace the origin of the attack.
Describe Spam and Popup Windows
Spam, also known as junk mail, is unsolicited e-mail. In most cases, spam is used for
advertising. However, spam can be used to send harmful links or deceptive content.
When used as an attack method, spam might include links to an infected website or an
attachment that could infect a computer. These links or attachments might generate lots of
windows (called popups) designed to capture your attention and lead you to advertising
sites. Uncontrolled popup windows can quickly cover your screen and prevent you from
getting any work done.
Chapter 9: Fundamental Security
7

Many antivirus and e-mail software programs automatically detect and remove spam from
an e-mail inbox. Some spam still may get through, so you should look for some of the more
common indications:
■No subject line
■An incomplete return addresses
■Computer-generated e-mails
■Return e-mails not sent by the user
Explain Social Engineering
A social engineer is a person who gains access to equipment or a network by tricking peo-
ple into providing the necessary information. Often, the social engineer gains the confi-
dence of an employee and convinces that person to divulge username and password infor-
mation.
A social engineer may pose as a technician to try to gain entry into a facility. When he is
inside, he may look over employees’ shoulders to gather information, seek out papers on
desks with passwords and phone extensions, or obtain a company directory with e-mail
addresses.
The following are some basic precautions to help protect against social engineering:
■Never give out your password.
■Always ask for the ID of unknown persons.
■Restrict the access of unexpected visitors.
■Escort all visitors.
■Never post your password in your work area.
■Log off or lock your computer when you leave your desk.
■Do not let anyone follow you through a door that requires an access card.
Explain TCP/IP Attacks
TCP/IP is the protocol suite that is used to control all the communications on the Internet.
Unfortunately, TCP/IP can also make a network available to attackers through the use of the
following common types of attacks:
■A SYN flood randomly opens TCP ports, tying up network equipment or a computer
with a large number of false requests, causing sessions to be denied to others.
■DoS attempts to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users.
8
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■DDoS is a DoS attack that uses “zombies” to make tracing the origin of the attack diffi-
cult.
■Spoofing is a method of gaining access to resources on devices by pretending to be a
trusted computer.
■Man-in-the-middle intercepts or inserts false information in traffic between two hosts.
■Replay uses network sniffers to extract usernames and passwords to be used later to
gain access.
■DNS poisoning changes the DNS records on a system to point to false servers where
the data is recorded.
Explain Hardware Deconstruction and Recycling
Hardware deconstruction is the process of removing sensitive data from hardware and soft-
ware before recycling or discarding them. Hard drives should be erased to prevent someone
from recovering the data using specialized software. It is not enough to delete files or even
format the drive. Use a third-party tool to overwrite data multiple times, rendering the data
unusable. The only way to be certain that data cannot be recovered from a hard drive is to
carefully shatter the platters with a hammer and safely dispose of the pieces.
Media such as CDs and floppy disks must also be destroyed. Use a shredding machine that
is designed for this purpose.
Identify Security Procedures
You should use a security plan to determine what will be done in a critical situation.
Security plan policies should be constantly updated to reflect the latest threats to a network.
A security plan with clear security procedures is the basis for a technician to follow.
Security plans should be reviewed each year.
Part of the process of ensuring security is conducting tests to determine areas where securi-
ty is weak. Testing should be done on a regular basis. New threats are released daily.
Regular testing provides details of any possible weaknesses in the current security plan that
should be addressed.
A network has multiple layers of security, as shown in Figure 9-1, including physical, wire-
less, and data. Each layer is subject to security attacks. The technician needs to understand
how to implement security procedures to protect equipment and data.

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Explain what is required in a basic local security policy.
■Explain the tasks required to protect physical equipment.
■Describe ways to protect data.
■Describe wireless security techniques.
Explain What Is Required in a Basic Local Security
Policy
Although local security policies may vary between organizations, all organizations should
ask the following questions:
■What assets require protection?
■What are the possible threats?
■What should be done in the event of a security breach?
A security policy should describe how a company defines security issues:
■A process for handling network security incidents
■A process for auditing existing network security
■A general security framework for implementing network security
■Behaviors that are allowed
■Behaviors that are prohibited

■What to log and how to store the logs: Event Viewer, system log files, or security log
files
■Network access to resources through account permissions
■Authentication technologies (such as usernames, passwords, biometrics, and smart
cards) to access data
Explain the Tasks Required to Protect Physical
Equipment
Physical security is as important as data security. When a computer is stolen, the data is
also stolen.
There are several ways to physically protect computer equipment:
■Control access to facilities.
■Use cable locks with equipment, as shown in Figure 9-2.
■Keep telecommunication rooms locked.
■Fit equipment with security screws, as shown in Figure 9-2.
■Use security cages around equipment, as shown in Figure 9-3.
■Label and install sensors, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, on
equipment.
Figure 9-2
Physical Security
Chapter 9: Fundamental Security
11

Figure 9-3
Locking Devices
12
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
For access to facilities, there are several means of protection:
■Card keys that store user data, including level of access
■Biometric sensors that identify the user’s physical characteristics, such as fingerprints
or retinas
■Posted security guard
■Sensors, such as RFID tags, to monitor equipment
Describe Ways to Protect Data
The value of physical equipment is often far less than the value of the data it contains. The
loss of sensitive data to a company’s competitors or to criminals may be costly. Such losses
may result in a lack of confidence in the company and the dismissal of computer techni-
cians in charge of computer security. To protect data, you can implement several methods
of security protection, as described in the following sections.
Password Protection
Password protection can prevent unauthorized access to content, as shown in Figure 9-4. To
keep attackers from gaining access to data, all computers should be password-protected.
Two levels of password protection are recommended:
■BIOS prevents BIOS settings from being changed without the appropriate password.
■Login prevents unauthorized access to the network.

Figure 9-4
Secured Connection
Chapter 9: Fundamental Security
13
Network logins provide a means of logging activity on the network and either preventing or
allowing access to resources. This makes it possible to determine what resources are being
accessed. Usually, the system administrator defines a naming convention for the usernames
when creating network logins. A common example of a username is the person’s first initial
and last name. You should keep the username naming convention simple so that people do
not have a hard time remembering it.
When passwords are assigned, the level of password control should match the level of pro-
tection required. A good security policy should be strictly enforced and should include, but
not be limited to, the following rules:
■Passwords should expire after a specific period of time.
■Passwords should contain a mixture of numbers, special characters, and uppercase and
lowercase letters so that they cannot easily be broken. They should have a minimum of
eight characters.
■Users should not write down passwords and leave them where anyone can find them.
■Rules about password expiration and lockout should be defined. Lockout rules apply
when an unsuccessful attempt has been made to access the system or when a specific
change has been detected in the system configuration.
To simplify the process of administering security, it is common to assign users to groups
and then assign groups to resources. This allows you to easily change the access level of
users on a network by assigning the users to or removing them from various groups. This is
useful when setting up temporary accounts for visiting workers or consultants, giving you
the ability to limit access to resources. 

Data Encryption
Encrypting data involves using codes and ciphers. Data encryption can help prevent attack-
ers from monitoring or recording traffic between resources and computers. It may not be
possible to decipher captured data in time to make any use of it. A security alert may
inform you that you are using an encrypted connection.
A virtual private network (VPN) is an encryption system that protects data as though it
resides on a private network. The data actually travels over the Internet or another unse-
cured public network.
Port Protection
Every communication using TCP/IP is associated with a port number. HTTPS, for instance,
by default uses port 443. A firewall, as illustrated in Figure 9-5, is a way of protecting a
computer from intrusion through the ports.
Figure 9-5
Firewall
14
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
With port protection, the user can control the type of data sent to a computer by selecting
which ports will be open and which will be secured. Data being transported on a network is
called traffic. Table 9-1 shows the ports and protocols associated with the more common
types of traffic.

Data Backups
You should include data backup procedures in a security plan. Data can be lost or damaged
in circumstances such as theft or equipment failure, or in a disaster, such as a fire or flood.
Backing up data is one of the most effective ways of protecting against data loss. Here are
some considerations for data backups:
■Frequency of backups: Backups can take a long time. Sometimes it is easier to make
a full backup monthly or weekly and then do frequent partial backups of any data that
has changed since the last full backup. However, spreading the backups over many
recordings increases the amount of time needed to restore the data.
■Storing backups: Backups should be transported to an approved offsite storage loca-
tion for extra security. The current backup medium is transported to the offsite location
on a daily, weekly, or monthly rotation, as required by the local organization.
■Security of backups: Backups can be protected with passwords. These passwords have
to be entered before the data on the backup media can be restored.
File System Security
All file systems keep track of resources, but only file systems with journals can log access
by user, date, and time. FAT32, which is used in some versions of the Windows file system,
lacks both journaling and encryption capabilities. As a result, situations that require good
security are usually deployed using a file system such as NTFS, which is part of Windows
2000 and Windows XP. When increased file system security is needed, it is possible to run
certain utilities, such as CONVERT, to upgrade a FAT32 file system to NTFS. The conver-
sion process is not reversible. It is important to define your goals clearly before making the
transition. Table 9-2 compares the FAT32 and NTFS file systems.

Describe Wireless Security Techniques
Traffic flows through radio waves in wireless networks, so it is easy for attackers to monitor
and attack data without having to connect to a network physically. Attackers gain access to
a network by being within range of an unprotected wireless network. A technician needs to
know how to configure access points and wireless network interface cards (WNIC) to an
appropriate level of security.
When installing wireless services, you should apply the following wireless security tech-
niques immediately to prevent unwanted access to the network:
■Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was the first-generation security standard for wire-
less. Attackers quickly discovered that 64-bit WEP encryption was easy to break.
Monitoring programs could detect the encryption keys used to encode the messages.
After the keys were obtained, messages could be easily decoded. In an attempt to over-
come this weakness, most users employ a 128-bit key for WEP.
■Change the default administration password.
16
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Disable the broadcasting of the Service Set Identifier (SSID) to hide it from other
users.
■Use MAC filtering to protect the network from other users.
■Change the default values of the SSID by entering the setup program for the access
point and renaming the SSID.
■Update to the latest available firmware.
■Install or activate a firewall, and adjust the settings to eliminate all traffic except the
desired network settings.
■Update to the latest available firmware.
■Install or activate a firewall, and adjust the settings to eliminate all traffic except the
desired network settings.
An attacker can access data as it travels over the radio signal. However, you can use a wire-
less encryption system to encode data and thereby prevent unwanted capture and use of the
data. Both ends of every link must use the same encryption standard. The following list
describes the different levels of wireless security, from most secure to least secure:
■Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP): Also called EAP-Cisco,
LEAP is a wireless security protocol created by Cisco to address the weaknesses in
WEP and WPA. LEAP is a good choice when using Cisco equipment in conjunction
with operating systems such as Windows and Linux.
■Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA): An improved version of WEP. It was created as a tem-
porary solution until 802.11i (a security layer for wireless systems) was fully imple-
mented. Now that 802.11i has been ratified, WPA2 has been released. It covers the
entire 802.11i standard. 
■WEP 128: An enhanced encryption protocol combining a 104-bit key and a 24-bit ini-
tialization vector.
■WEP 64: The first-generation security standard for wireless. It could be exploited
because of an encryption key that was vulnerable to decoding.
■No security: Although you can elect to implement no security whatsoever, you leave
your wireless network completely vulnerable to attack.
In addition, Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS) is a security layer used in mobile
devices that employ the Wireless Applications Protocol (WAP). Mobile devices do not have
a great deal of spare bandwidth to devote to security protocols. WTLS was designed to pro-
vide security for WAP devices in a bandwidth-efficient manner.

Identify Common Preventive Maintenance
Techniques for Security
Regular security updates are essential to meet the threat from attackers constantly searching
for new ways of breaching security. Software manufacturers have to regularly create and
issue new patches to fix flaws and vulnerabilities in products. If a technician leaves a com-
puter unprotected, an attacker can easily gain access. Unprotected computers on the Internet
may become infected within a few minutes.
Because of the constantly changing security threats, a technician should understand how to
install patches and updates, as shown in Figure 9-6. They should also be able to recognize
when new updates and patches are available. Some manufacturers release updates on the
same day every month and also send out critical updates when necessary. Other manufactur-
ers provide automatic update services that patch the software every time a computer is
turned on. Manufacturers also often send e-mail notifications when a new patch or update is
released.

■Explain how to update signature files for virus checkers and spyware.
■Explain how to install operating system service packs and security patches.

Explain How to Update Signature Files for Virus
Checkers and Spyware
Threats to security from viruses and worms are always present. Attackers constantly look
for new ways to infiltrate computers and networks. Because new viruses are always being
developed, security software must be continually updated. This process can be performed
automatically, but a technician should know how to manually update any type of protection
software and all customer application programs.
Virus, spyware, and adware detection programs look for patterns in the programming code
of the software in a computer. These patterns are determined by analyzing viruses that are
intercepted on the Internet and on local-area networks (LAN). These code patterns are
called signatures. The publishers of protection software compile the signatures into virus
definition tables. To update signature files for antivirus and antispyware software, first
check to see if the signature files are the most recent ones. You can do this by navigating to
the About option of the protection software or by launching the update tool for the protec-
tion software. If the signature files are out of date, update them manually with the Update
Now option available on most protection software.
You should always retrieve the signature files from the manufacturer’s website. However, to
avoid creating too much traffic at a single site, some manufacturers distribute the signature
files for download to multiple download sites. These download sites are called mirrors.
To update a signature file, follow these steps:
Step 1.
Set the Windows restore point.
Step 2.
Open the antivirus or antispyware program.
Step 3.
Locate the update control button, and select it.
Step 4.
After the program is updated, use it to scan your computer.
Step 5.
When the scan is complete, check the report for viruses or other problems that
could not be treated, and delete them yourself.
Step 6.
Set the antivirus or antispyware program to automatically update and to run on a
scheduled basis.
Caution
When downloading the signature files from a mirror, ensure that the mirror site is legitimate. Always
link to the mirror site from the manufacturer’s website.

How To

Explain How to Install Operating System Service
Packs and Security Patches
Viruses and worms can be difficult to remove from a computer. Software tools are required
to remove viruses and repair the computer code that the virus has modified. These software
tools are provided by operating system manufacturers and security software companies.
Make sure that you download these tools from a legitimate site.
Manufacturers of operating systems and software applications may provide code updates
called patches that prevent a newly discovered virus or worm from making a successful
attack. From time to time, manufacturers combine patches and upgrades into a comprehen-
sive update application called a service pack. Many infamous and devastating virus attacks
could have been much less severe if more users had downloaded and installed the latest
service pack.
The Windows operating system routinely checks the Windows Update website for high-pri-
ority updates that can help protect a computer from the latest security threat. These updates
can include security updates, critical updates, and service packs. Depending on the setting
you choose, Windows automatically downloads and installs any high-priority updates that
your computer needs, or notifies you as these updates become available.
Updates must be installed, not just downloaded. If you use the Automatic setting, you can
schedule the time and day. Otherwise, new updates are installed at 3 a.m. by default. If your
computer is turned off during a scheduled update, updates are installed the next time you
start your computer. You can also choose to have Windows notify you when a new update is
available and install the update yourself.
To update the operating system with a service pack or security patch, follow these steps:
Step 1.
Create a restore point in case of a problem with the update.
Step 2.
Check the updates to ensure that you have the latest ones.
Step 3.
Download the updates using Automatic Updates or from the operating system
manufacturer’s website.
Step 4.
Install the update.
Step 5.
Restart if required.
Step 6.
Test all aspects to ensure that the update has not caused any issues.

How To

Troubleshoot Security
The troubleshooting process is used to help resolve security issues. These problems range
from simple, such as preventing someone from watching over your shoulder, to more com-
plex problems, such as manually removing infected files. Use the troubleshooting steps as a
guideline to help diagnose and repair problems.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Review the troubleshooting process.
■Identify common problems and solutions.
Review the Troubleshooting Process
Computer technicians must be able to analyze a security threat and determine the appropri-
ate method to protect assets and repair damage. This process is called troubleshooting.
Step 1: Gather Data from the Customer
The first step in the troubleshooting process is to gather data from the customer. Table 9-3
lists open-ended and closed-ended questions to ask the customer about security issues.
(This list is not comprehensive.)

Step 2: Verify the Obvious Issues
After you have talked to the customer, you should verify the obvious issues. Here are some
issues that apply to laptops:
■Have people asked you to stop sending them strange e-mails even though you have not
sent them anything?
■Have any items on your desktop been moved?
■Has your computer been running slower than normal, or is it unresponsive?
■Do you see any unfamiliar login addresses in the login window?
■Are there any unexplained entries in the security protection software logs?
■Is your Internet connection unusually slow?
Step 3: Try Quick Solutions First
After you have verified the obvious issues, try some quick solutions:
■Reboot the computer or network device.
■Log in as a different user.
■Check that the antivirus and spyware signature files are up-to-date.
■Scan the computer with protection software.
■Check the computer for the latest operating system patches and updates.
■Disconnect from the network. 
■Change your password.
Step 4: Gather Data from the Computer
If quick solutions do not correct the problem, it is time to gather data from the computer:
■Verify that the signature file is current.
■Check the security software log file for entries.
Step 5: Evaluate the Problem and Implement the Solution
At this point, you have enough information to evaluate the problem and to research and
implement possible solutions. Here are some resources for possible solutions:
■Problem-solving experience
■Other technicians
■Internet search
22
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Newsgroups
■Manufacturer FAQs
■Computer manuals
■Device manuals
■Online forums
■Technical websites
Step 6: Close with the Customer
After you have solved the problem, you close with the customer. Here are the steps required
to complete this task:
Step 1.
Discuss the solution implemented with the customer.
Step 2.
Have the customer verify that the problem has been solved.
Step 3.
Provide the customer with all the paperwork.
Step 4.
Document the steps taken to solve the problem in the work order and the techni-
cian’s journal.
Step 5.
Document any components used in the repair.
Step 6.
Document the time spent to resolve the problem. 
Identify Common Problems and Solutions
Maintaining a computer can be a challenge. One of the biggest challenges is making sure
that your computer software is updated and secure. Table 9-4 is a chart of common security

What is the relationship between communication skills and troubleshooting? As a computer
technician, you will not only fix computers; you also will interact with people. In fact, trou-
bleshooting is as much about communicating with the customer as it is about knowing how
to fix a computer. In this chapter, you will learn how to use good communication skills as
confidently as you use a screwdriver.
Explain the Relationship Between
Communication and Troubleshooting
Think of a time when you had to call a repair person to get something fixed. Did it feel like
an emergency to you? Did you appreciate it when the repair person was sympathetic and
responsive? Perhaps you had a bad experience with a repair person. Are you likely to call
that same person to fix a problem again?
Good communication skills enhance a technician’s troubleshooting skills. Both of these
skill sets take time and experience to develop. As your hardware, software, and operating
system knowledge increases, your ability to quickly determine a problem and find a solu-
tion will improve. The same principle applies to developing communication skills. The
more you practice good communication skills, the more effective you will become when
working with customers. A knowledgeable technician who uses good communication skills
will always be in demand in the job market.
To troubleshoot a computer, you need to learn the details of the problem from the customer.
Most people who need a computer problem fixed are probably feeling some stress. If you
establish a good rapport with the customer, he or she may relax a bit. A relaxed customer is
more likely to provide the information you need to determine the source of the problem and
then fix it.
Speaking directly with the customer is usually the first step in resolving the computer prob-
lem. As a technician, you will have access to several communication and research tools.
You can use all these resources to gather information for the troubleshooting process. Some
examples of technician resources are
■Personal experience
■Scripts
■Websites
■Search engines

chapter.
Describe Good Communication Skills and
Professional Behavior
Whether you are talking with a customer on the phone or in person, it is important to com-
municate well and to represent yourself professionally. Your professionalism and good
communication skills will enhance your creditability with the customer.
A customer can “see” your body language. A customer can hear your sighs and sense that
you are sneering, even over the phone. Conversely, customers can also sense that you are
smiling when you speak with them on the phone. Many call-center technicians have a mir-
ror at their desk to monitor their facial expressions.
Successful technicians control their reactions and emotions from one customer call to the
next. A good rule for all technicians to follow is that a new customer call means a fresh
start. Never carry your frustration from one call to the next.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Determine the customer’s computer problem.
■Display professional behavior with the customer.
■Focus the customer on the problem during the call.
■Use proper Netiquette.
■Implement workstation ergonomics and time- and stress-management techniques.
■Observe service level agreements (SLA).
■Follow business policies. 
Chapter 10: Communication Skills
3

Determine the Customer’s Computer Problem
One of the technician’s first tasks is to determine the type of computer problem that the cus-
tomer is experiencing.
Remember these three rules at the beginning of your conversation:
■Know: Call your customer by name.
■Relate: Use brief communication to create a one-to-one connection between you and
your customer.
■Understand: Determine the customer’s level of knowledge about her computer to
know how to effectively communicate with her.
To accomplish these tasks, you should practice active listening skills. Allow the customer to
tell the whole story. As the customer is explaining the problem, occasionally interject a
small word or phrase, such as “I understand,” “Yes,” “I see,” or “Okay.” This behavior lets
the customer know that you are there and listening. This is not the same as interrupting the
customer to ask a question or make a statement.
A technician should not interrupt the customer to ask a question or make a statement. This
is rude and disrespectful and creates tension. Many times in a conversation, you might find
yourself thinking about what to say before the other person finishes talking. When you do
this, you are not really listening. As practice, try listening carefully when other people
speak, and let them finish their thoughts.
After you have listened to the customer explain the whole problem, clarify what the person
has said. This helps convince the customer that you have heard and understand the situation.
A good practice for clarification is to paraphrase the customer’s explanation by beginning
with “Let me see if I understand what you have told me....” This is a very effective tool that
shows the customer that you have listened and that you are concerned about the issues. 
After you have assured the customer that you understand the problem, you will probably
have to ask some follow-up questions. Make sure that these questions are pertinent. Do not
ask questions that the customer has already answered while describing the problem. Doing
this only irritates the customer and shows that you were not listening.
Follow-up questions should be targeted, closed-ended questions based on the information
you have already gathered. Closed-ended questions should focus on obtaining specific
information. The customer should be able to answer with a simple “yes” or “no” or with a
factual response such as “Windows XP Pro.” Use all the information you have gathered
from the customer to continue filling out the work order. 
Display Professional Behavior with the Customer
When dealing with customers, you must be professional in all aspects of your role. You
must handle customers with respect and prompt attention. When on the phone, make sure
4
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

that you know how to put a customer on hold, as well as how to transfer a customer without
losing the call. How you conduct the call is important. Your job is to help the customer
focus on and communicate the problem so that you can solve it.
Be positive when communicating with the customer. Tell him what you can do. Do not
focus on what you cannot do. Be prepared to explain alternative ways in which you can
help him, such as e-mailing information, faxing step-by-step instructions, or using remote-
control software to solve the problem. Customers will quickly sense whether you are inter-
ested in helping them.
Here are some recommendations to follow before you put a customer on hold. First, let the
customer finish speaking. Then, explain that you have to put him on hold, and ask him for
permission to do so. When the customer agrees to be put on hold, thank him. Tell him that
you will be away only a few minutes, and explain what you will be doing during that time.

Follow the same process for a call transfer as you do when placing a customer on hold. Let
the customer finish talking, and then explain that you have to transfer the call. When the
customer agrees to be transferred, tell her the phone number that you are transferring her to.
You should also tell the new technician your name, the name of the customer you are trans-
ferring, and the related ticket number.

When dealing with customers, it is sometimes easier to explain what you should not do.
Observe the following list of things you should avoid when communicating with a cus-
tomer:
■Minimizing customer problems.
■Using jargon, abbreviations, and acronyms.
■Displaying a negative attitude or using a negative tone of voice.
■Arguing with customers or becoming defensive.
■Being judgmental or insulting or calling the customer names.
■Distractions and interruptions when talking with customers.
■Unnecessary and abrupt holds.
■Transferring a call without explaining the purpose of the transfer and getting the cus-
tomer’s consent.
■Making negative remarks about other technicians to the customer.

and the customer’s time on troubleshooting the problem. Do not take any comments person-
ally, and do not retaliate with comments or criticism. If you stay calm, finding a solution to
the problem remains the focal point of the call.
Just as there are many different computer problems, there are many different types of cus-
tomers. The list of problem-customer types described in the following sections is not com-
prehensive; often a customer can display a combination of traits. You need to recognize
which traits your customer exhibits. Recognizing these traits will help you manage the call
accordingly.
Talkative Customer
A talkative customer discusses everything except the problem. This kind of customer often
uses the call as an opportunity to socialize. It can be difficult to get a talkative customer to
focus on the problem. Table 10-3 lists dos and don’ts for dealing with a talkative customer.

Allow the customer to talk for one minute.
Encourage non-problem-related conversa-
tion by asking social questions such as
“How are you today?”
Gather as much information about the 
problem as possible.
Politely step in to refocus the customer. This 
is the exception to the rule of never 
interrupting a customer.
Ask as many closed-ended questions as 
you need to after you have regained control 
of the call.
Rude Customer
A rude customer complains during the call and often makes negative comments about the
product, the service, and the technician. This type of customer is sometimes abusive and
uncooperative and is easily aggravated. Table 10-4 lists dos and don’ts for dealing with a
rude customer.

and solving the problem.
If the customer has a favorite technician, try to 
contact that technician to see if he or she can 
take the call. For example, tell the customer, “I 
can either help you right now or see if (the 
preferred technician) is available. He will be 
available in two hours. Is that acceptable?” If the 
customer wants to wait for the other technician,
record this in the ticket.
Apologize for the wait time and the inconvenience,
even if there has been no wait time.
Reiterate that you want to solve the customer’s 
problem as quickly as possible. 
Angry Customer
An angry customer talks loudly during the call and often tries to speak when the technician
is talking. Angry customers are usually frustrated that they have a problem and upset that
they have to call somebody to fix it. Table 10-5 lists dos and don’ts for dealing with an
angry customer.

Knowledgeable Customer
A knowledgeable customer wants to speak with a technician who is equally experienced in
computers. This type of customer usually tries to control the call and does not want to
speak with a level-one technician. Table 10-6 lists dos and don’ts for dealing with a knowl-
edgeable customer.

Class Discussion 10.2.3: Identifying Difficult Customer Types
In this activity, the class identifies difficult customer types through the use of five scenarios.
Refer to the relevant topics in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study
Guide, Third Edition to help you prepare for this discussion. 
Use Proper Netiquette
Have you read a blog where two or three members have stopped discussing the issue and
are simply insulting each other? These are called “flame wars,” and they occur in blogs and
Chapter 10: Communication Skills
9

e-mail threads. Have you ever wondered if they would say those things to each other in per-
son? Perhaps you have received an e-mail that had no greeting or was written entirely in
capital letters. How did this make you feel?
As a technician, you should be professional in all communications with customers. E-mail
and text communications have a set of personal and business etiquette rules called
Netiquette.
In addition to e-mail and text Netiquette, general rules apply to all your online interactions
with customers and coworkers:
■Remember that you are dealing with people.
■Adhere to the same standards of behavior that you follow in real life.
■Respect people’s time and bandwidth.
■Share expert knowledge.
■Do not engage in “flame wars” online.
■Respect people’s privacy.
■Be forgiving of people’s mistakes.
The preceding list is not comprehensive. When dealing with a customer, consider all the
rules about online communication that you can think of. 
Implement Workstation Ergonomics and Time- and
Stress-Management Techniques
As a technician, you are a very busy person. It is important for your well-being to ensure
that your work area is as comfortable as possible and that you use proper time- and stress-
management techniques. The following sections describe these considerations and tech-
niques in greater detail.
Workstation Ergonomics
The ergonomics of your work area (its design and arrangement for optimum safe and effi-
cient interaction) can help you do your job or make it more difficult. Because you may
spend the major portion of your day at your workstation, make sure that the desk layout
works well, as shown in Figure 10-1. Have your headset and phone in a position that is both
easy to reach and easy to use. Your chair should be adjusted to a height that is comfortable.
Adjust your computer screen to a comfortable angle so that you do not have to tilt your
head to see it. Make sure your keyboard and mouse are also in a comfortable position. You
should not have to bend your wrists to type. If possible, try to minimize external distrac-
tions such as noise.
10
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Figure 10-1
Workstation Ergonomics
Chapter 10: Communication Skills
11
Time Management
For time management, it is important to prioritize your activities. Make sure that you care-
fully follow your company’s business policy. The company policy may state that you must
take “down” calls first, even though they may be harder to solve. A “down” call usually
means that a server is not working and the entire office or company is waiting for the prob-
lem to be resolved before they can resume business.
If you have to call a customer back, make sure that you do so as close to the callback time
as possible. Keep a list of callback customers, and check them off one at a time as you com-
plete these calls. Doing this ensures that you do not forget a customer.
When working with many customers, do not give your favorite customers faster or better
service. When reviewing the call boards (as shown in Figure 10-2), do not take only the
easy calls. Do not take the call of another technician unless you have permission to do so. 
Stress Management
For stress management, take a moment to compose yourself between customer calls. Every
call should be independent of the others. Do not carry any frustrations from one call to the
next.
You might have to do some physical activity to relieve stress. Stand up and take a short
walk. Do a few simple stretch movements or squeeze a tension ball. Take a break if you
can, and try to relax. You then will be ready to answer the next customer call effectively.

Figure 10-2
Call Board
12
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Here are some ways to relax:
■Practice relaxed breathing: inhale-hold-exhale-repeat.
■Listen to soothing sounds.
■Massage your temples.
■Take a break. Go for a quick walk, or climb a flight of stairs.
■Eat something small (a snack with protein is best).
■Plan your weekend.
■Avoid stimulants such as coffee, carbonated drinks, and chocolate. All contain caffeine
and can add to stress.
Think of other appropriate activities that might relieve stress for you at work.
Observe Service Level Agreements (SLA)
When dealing with customers, it is important to adhere to that customer’s service level
agreement (SLA). This is a contract that defines expectations between an organization and
the service vendor to provide an agreed-upon level of support. As an employee of the serv-
ice company, your job is to honor the SLA that you have with the customer. Figure 10-3
shows a sample SLA with some of the standard sections highlighted:
■Service monitoring
■Contingency

■Maintenance windows
■Response time guarantee
Figure 10-3
Service Level Agreement
Chapter 10: Communication Skills
13
An SLA typically is a legal agreement that describes the responsibilities and liabilities of all
parties involved. Some of the contents of an SLA usually include the following:
■Response-time guarantees (often based on the type of call and the SLA)
■Equipment and/or software that will be supported
■Where service will be provided
■Preventive maintenance
■Diagnostics
■Part availability (equivalent parts)
■Cost and penalties
■Time of service availability (for example, 24/7; Monday through Friday; 8 a.m. to 5
p.m. EST; and so on)
There may be exceptions to the SLA. Be sure to follow your company business rules in
detail. Some of the exceptions may include the customer’s ability to upgrade the service
level and the ability to escalate to management for review. Escalation to management
should be reserved for special situations. For example, a long-standing customer or a cus-
tomer from a very large company might have a problem that falls outside the parameters
stated in his or her SLA with your service company. In these cases, your management may
choose to support the customer for customer-relations reasons.

Consider other circumstances in which it might be a good idea to escalate a call to manage-
ment. 
Follow Business Policies
As a technician, you should be aware of all business policies related to customer calls.
Don’t make a promise to a customer that you cannot keep. You should also have a good
understanding of all rules governing employees. Table 10-8 lists typical customer call rules
as well as call center employee rules.

Explain Ethics and Legal Aspects of Working
with Computer Technology
When you are working with customers and their equipment, you should observe some gen-
eral ethical customs and legal rules. Often, these customs and rules overlap.
Ethical Customs
You should always respect your customers, as well as their property. Property includes any
information or data that may be accessible. Information or data that is subject to ethical
customs includes the following items:
■E-mails
■Phone lists
■Records or data on the computer
■Hard copies of files, information, or data left on the desk
Before accessing a computer account, including the administrator account, you should get
the customer’s permission. From the troubleshooting process, you may have gathered some
private information, such as usernames and passwords. If you document this type of private
information, you must keep it confidential. Divulging any customer information to anyone
else is not only unethical, but it might be illegal. Legal details of customer information are
usually covered under the SLA.
Do not send unsolicited messages to a customer. Do not send unsolicited mass mailings or
chain letters to customers. Never send forged or anonymous e-mails. All these activities are
considered unethical and, in certain circumstances, may be illegal. In either case, these
activities could result in job termination.
Legal Rules
Several computer-related activities are not only unethical, but illegal. Be aware that this is
not an exhaustive list of legal rules:
■Do not make any changes to system software or hardware configurations without the
customer’s permission.
■Do not access a customer’s or coworker’s accounts, private files, or e-mail messages
without permission.
■Do not install, copy, or share digital content (including software, music, text, images,
and video) in violation of copyright or software agreements or applicable federal and
state laws.
■Do not use a customer’s company IT resources for commercial purposes.
Chapter 10: Communication Skills
15

■Do not make a customer’s IT resources available to unauthorized users.
■Keep sensitive customer information confidential.
■Do not knowingly use a customer’s company resources for illegal activities. Criminal
or illegal use may include child pornography, threats, harassment, copyright infringe-
ment, university trademark infringement, defamation, theft, identity theft, and unautho-
rized access.
Make sure you know the copyright and trademark laws in your state or country.
Class Discussion 10.3.0: Customer Privacy
In this activity, the class discusses the importance of respecting customer privacy through
the use of three scenarios. Refer to the relevant topics in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and
Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition to help you prepare for this discussion. 
Describe the Call Center Environment and
Technician Responsibilities
A call center environment is usually very professional and fast-paced. A call center is a
help desk system where customers call in and are placed on a call board. Available techni-
cians take the customer calls. A technician must supply the level of support that is outlined
in the customer’s SLA.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe the call center environment.
■Describe level-one technician responsibilities.
■Describe level-two technician responsibilities.
Describe the Call Center Environment
A call center may exist within a company and offer service to the employees of that company
as well as to the customers of that company’s products. Alternatively, a call center may be an
independent business that sells computer support as a service to outside customers. In either
case, a call center is a busy, fast-paced work environment, often operating 24 hours a day.
Call centers tend to have a large number of cubicles. Each cubicle has a chair, at least one
computer, and a phone with a headset. The technicians working at these cubicles have var-
ied levels of experience in computers. Some have specialties in certain types of computers,
software, or operating systems.
16
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

All the computers in a call center have help-desk software. The technicians use this soft-
ware to manage many of their job functions. Although it is not a complete list of most fea-
tures of help-desk software, the following list provides more detail:
■Log and track incidents: The software may manage call queues, set call priorities,
assign calls, and escalate calls.
■Record contact information: The software may store, edit, and recall customer
names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, locations, websites, fax numbers, and other
information in a database.
■Research product information: The software may provide to technicians information
on the products they support, including features, limitations, new versions, configura-
tion constraints, known bugs, product availability, links to online help files, and other
information.
■Run diagnostic utilities: The software may have several diagnostic utilities, including
remote diagnostic software, in which the technician can “take over” a customer’s com-
puter while sitting at a desk in the call center.
■Research a knowledge base: The software may contain a knowledge database that is
preprogrammed with common problems and their solutions. This database may grow as
technicians add their own records of problems and solutions.
■Collect customer feedback: The software may collect customer feedback on satisfac-
tion with the call center’s products and services.
Your call center will have its own business policies for call priority. Table 10-9 is a sample
chart of how calls may be named, defined, and prioritized.

Describe Level-One Technician Responsibilities
Call centers sometimes have different names for level-one technicians. These technicians
may be known as level-one analysts, dispatchers, or incident screeners. Regardless of the
Chapter 10: Communication Skills
17

title, the level-one technician’s responsibilities are fairly similar from one call center to the
next.
The primary responsibility of a level-one technician is to gather pertinent information from
the customer. The technician has to document all the information in the ticket or work
order. Here is some of the information a level-one technician must obtain:
■Contact information
■Description of the problem
■Priority of the problem
■The computer’s manufacturer and model
■The computer’s operating system
■Whether the computer uses AC or DC power
■Whether the computer is on a network and, if so, whether it is a wired or wireless con-
nection
■If a specific application was being used when the problem occurred
■If any new drivers or updates have been installed recently and, if so, what they are
Some problems are very simple to resolve, and a level-one technician usually can take care
of these without escalating the work order to a level-two technician.
Often, a problem requires the expertise of a level-two technician. In these cases, the level-
one technician must be able to translate the customer’s problem description into a succinct
sentence or two that are entered into the work order. This translation is important so that
other technicians can quickly understand the situation without having to ask the customer
the same questions again. Table 10-10 shows how a customer might describe some of the
most common problems and how a technician should document those problems. 
Table 10-10

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Describe Level-Two Technician Responsibilities
As with level-one technicians, call centers sometimes have different names for level-two
technicians. These technicians may be known as product specialists or technical-support
personnel. The level-two technician’s responsibilities generally are the same from one call
center to the next.
The level-two technician is usually more knowledgeable than the level-one technician about
technology, or has been working for the company for a longer period of time. When a prob-
lem cannot be resolved within ten minutes, the level-one technician prepares an escalated
work order. The level-two technician receives the escalated work order with the description
of the problem. That person then calls the customer back to ask additional questions and
resolve the problem.
The following list of guidelines details when to escalate a problem to a more experienced
technician. These are generic guidelines; you should follow your company’s business policy
for problem escalation.
■Escalate problems that require opening the computer case.
■Escalate problems that require installing applications, operating systems, or drivers.
■Escalate problems that will take a long time to walk a customer through, such as
Configuration Memory Operating System (CMOS) changes.
■Escalate “down” calls. The entire network is down, and a more experienced tech may
be able to resolve the issue faster.
Problems that require opening the computer case need a level-two technician. Level-two
technicians can also use remote diagnostic software to connect to the customer’s computer
to update drivers and software, access the operating system, check the BIOS, and gather
other diagnostic information to solve the problem.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the relationship between communication skills and trou-
bleshooting skills. You have learned that these two skills need to be combined to make you
a successful technician. You also learned about the legal aspects and ethics of dealing with
computer technology and the customer’s property.
The following concepts from this chapter are important to remember:
■To be a successful technician, you need to practice good communication skills with
customers and coworkers. These skills are as important as technical expertise.
■You should always conduct yourself in a professional manner with your customers and
coworkers. Professional behavior increases customer confidence and enhances your
credibility. You should also learn to recognize the classic signs of a difficult customer
and learn what to do and what not to do when you are on a call with this customer.
■You can use a few techniques to keep a difficult customer focused on the problem dur-
ing a call. Primarily, you must remain calm and ask pertinent questions in an appropri-
ate fashion. These techniques keep you in control of the call.
■There is a right way and a wrong way to put a customer on hold, or transfer a customer
to another technician. Learn and use the right way every time. Performing either of
these operations incorrectly can seriously damage your company’s relationship with its
customers.
■Netiquette is a list of rules to use whenever you communicate through e-mail, text mes-
saging, instant messaging, or blogs. This is another area where doing things the wrong
way can damage your company’s relationship with its customers.
■You must understand and comply with your customer’s service level agreement (SLA).
If the problem falls outside the SLA, you need to find positive ways of telling the cus-
tomer what you can do to help, not what you cannot do. In special circumstances, you
may decide to escalate the work order to management.
■In addition to the SLA, you must follow the company’s business policies. These poli-
cies include how your company prioritizes calls, how and when to escalate a call to
management, and when you are allowed to take breaks and lunch.
■A computer technician’s job is stressful. You will rarely talk to a customer who is hav-
ing a good day. You can alleviate some of the stress by setting up your workstation in
the most ergonomic way possible. You should practice time- and stress-management
techniques every day.
■There are ethical and legal aspects to working in computer technology. You should be
aware of your company’s policies and practices. In addition, you may need to become
familiar with your state or country’s trademark and copyright laws.

Chapter 10: Communication Skills
21
■The call center is a fast-paced environment. Level-one technicians and level-two techni-
cians each have specific responsibilities. These responsibilities may vary slightly from
one call center to another.

Field technicians work in various conditions and businesses. You might work for one com-
pany and only repair that company’s assets. Alternatively, you might work for a company
that provides on-site computer equipment repair for a variety of companies and customers.
In either of these situations, you need both excellent troubleshooting skills and customer
service skills, because you are in regular contact with customers and work on a wide variety
of hardware and software.

If you are a remote technician, you might work at a help desk answering calls or e-mails
from customers who have computer problems. You create work orders and communicate
with the customer to try to diagnose and repair the problem.
Good communication skills are valuable because the customer must clearly understand your
questions and instructions. Some help desks use software to connect directly to a customer’s
computer to fix the problem. As a remote technician, you can work on a team of help desk
technicians for an organization or from home.
As a bench technician, you typically would not work directly with customers. Bench techni-
cians are often hired to perform computer warranty service in a central depot or work facility.
Worksheet 11.1.0: Job Opportunities
In this worksheet, you research computer-related jobs. Refer to the worksheet in IT
Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-
58713-198-6). You can perform this worksheet now or wait until the end of the chapter.
Explain Safe Lab Procedures and Tool Use
Safety should always be your priority on a job or in the lab. As a computer technician, you
should be aware of the many workplace hazards, and you should take the necessary precau-
tions to avoid them.
You should try to practice safety in the lab so that it becomes part of your regular routine.
Follow all safety procedures and use the correct tools for the job. This policy will help pre-
vent personal injury and damage to equipment.
To accomplish a safe working environment, it is better to be proactive rather than reactive.
Here is a list of safety rules to help you maintain a safe working environment:
■Keep the work area clean and free of clutter.
■Keep food and drinks out of the work area.
■Never open a computer monitor unless you have been properly trained.
■Remove all your jewelry and watches.
■Make sure that the power is off and that the power plug has been removed.
■Do not look into the laser beams located in the computer equipment.
■Make sure that there is a fire extinguisher and first aid kit available.
■Cover sharp edges with tape when working inside the computer case.

After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Review safe working environment and procedures
■Review names, purposes, characteristics, and safe and appropriate use of tools
■Identify potential safety hazards and implement proper safety procedures for computer
components
■Describe environmental issues
Review Safe Working Environments and Procedures
Workplace safety is necessary to ensure that you, and everyone near you, stay unharmed. In
any situation, you should always follow these basic rules:
■Use antistatic mats and pads to reduce the chance of electrostatic discharge (ESD)
damaging your equipment.
■Store hazardous or toxic materials in a secured cabinet.
■Keep the floor clear of anything that might trip someone.
■Clean work areas on a regular basis.
Figure 11-1 shows examples of safety equipment.

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
You should use caution when you move computer equipment from one place to another.
Make sure that customers follow the safety rules in your work area. You might need to
explain these rules and assure customers that the rules are there to protect them.

Follow local codes and government rules whenever you dispose of such things as batteries,
solvents, computers, and monitors. Failing to do so can result in a fine. Many countries
have agencies to enforce safety standards and ensure safe working conditions for employees.
Review Names, Purposes, Characteristics, and Safe
and Appropriate Use of Tools
A computer technician needs proper tools to work safely and to prevent damage to the com-
puter equipment. There are many tools, as shown in Figure 11-2, that a technician uses to
diagnose and repair computer problems:
■Flat head screwdriver, large and small
■Phillips head screwdriver, large and small
■Tweezers or part retriever
■Needle-nose pliers
■Wire cutters
■Chip extractor
■Hex wrench set
■Torx screwdriver
■Nut driver, large and small
■Three-claw component holder
■Digital multimeter
■Wrap plugs
■Small mirror
■Small dust brush
■Soft, lint-free cloth
■Cable ties

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Static electricity is one of the biggest concerns for computer technicians when working in
many environments. The tools you use and even your own body can store or conduct thou-
sands of volts of electricity. Walking across carpet or a rug and touching a computer com-
ponent before grounding yourself can severely damage the component.
Antistatic devices help control static electricity. Use antistatic devices to prevent damage to
sensitive components. Before you touch a computer component, be sure to ground yourself
by touching a grounded computer chassis or mat. These are some antistatic devices:
■Antistatic wrist strap: Conducts static electricity from your body to ground
■Antistatic mat: Grounds the computer frame
■Antistatic bag: Keeps sensitive computer components safe when not installed inside a
computer
■Cleaning products: Maintain components without creating a buildup of static electricity
Caution
To help prevent electric shock, do not wear an antistatic wrist strap when working with high-voltage
circuits, such as those found in monitors and printers. Do not open monitors or power supplies unless
you are properly trained.
Identify Potential Safety Hazards and Implement
Proper Safety Procedures for Computer Components
Most internal computer components use low-voltage electricity. Some components, howev-
er, operate with high voltage and can be dangerous if you do not follow safety precautions.

The following dangerous, high-voltage computer components should only be serviced by
authorized personnel:
■Power supplies: The cost to repair a power supply can sometimes equal the cost of a
new power supply, so most broken or used power supplies are replaced. Only experi-
enced certified technicians should service power supplies.
■Display monitors: The internal electronic parts of a display monitor cannot be
repaired, but they can be replaced. Monitors, especially CRT monitors, operate using
high voltages. Only a certified electronic technician should service them.
■Laser printers: Laser printers can be very expensive. It is more cost effective to fix
broken printers by repairing or replacing broken parts. Laser printers use high voltages
and can have very hot surfaces inside. Use caution when servicing laser printers.
Figure 11-3 shows an example of a high-voltage warning sign.

Describe Environmental Issues
The Earth’s environment is delicately balanced. The hazardous materials found in computer
components must be disposed of in specific ways to help maintain this balance. A computer
recycling warehouse is a place where discarded computer equipment can be taken apart.
Computer parts that are still usable can be recycled for repairing other equipment.
Recycling warehouses must obey the codes and regulations for the disposal of each type of
computer part. Before parts are recycled, they are separated into groups. CRT monitors con-
tain as much as 4 to 5 lb. (1.6 to 2.3 kg) of lead, a dangerous element. Much of the lead is
inside cathode ray tubes. Other materials inside computer equipment are also dangerous:

■Mercury
■Cadmium
■Hexavalent chromium
Batteries are used to power laptop computers, digital cameras, camcorders, and remote-con-
trol toys. Batteries can contain some of these toxic materials:
■Nickel cadmium (Ni-Cd)
■Nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH)
■Lithium ion (Li-ion)
■Lead (Pb)
Many organizations have policies that define disposal methods for the hazardous compo-
nents found in electronic equipment. These methods typically include programs to reuse,
recycle, or exchange.
You might need to dispose of computer components because they have become outdated, or
you might need additional functionality. In addition to recycling parts, you can donate them
to other people or organizations. Some businesses exchange used computer equipment for
partial payment of new equipment. 
Describe Situations Requiring Replacement of
Computer Components
Situations that require the replacement of computer components include the repair of bro-
ken parts or an upgrade for functionality.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Select a case and power supply
■Select a motherboard
■Select a CPU and cooling system
■Select RAM
■Select adapter cards
■Select storage devices and hard drives
■Select input and output devices

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Select a Case and Power Supply
You should determine the customer’s needs before making any purchases or performing
upgrades. Ask your customer what devices will be connected to the computer and what
applications will be used.
The computer case holds the power supply, motherboard, memory, and other components,
as shown in Figure 11-4. When purchasing a new computer case and power supply sepa-
rately, you should ensure that all the components will fit into the new case and that the
power supply is powerful enough to operate all the components. Many times a case comes
with a power supply inside. You still need to verify that the power supply provides enough
power to operate all the components that will be installed in the case.
Figure 11-4
Computer Case and Power Supply
Chapter 11: Advanced Personal Computers

Select a Motherboard
New motherboards, as shown in Figure 11-5, often have new features or standards that can
be incompatible with older components. When you select a replacement motherboard,
make sure that it supports the CPU, RAM, video adapter, and other adapter cards. The
socket and chipset on the motherboard must be compatible with the CPU. The motherboard
must also accommodate the existing heat sink/fan assembly.
The existing power supply must have connections that fit the new motherboard. Pay particu-
lar attention to the number and type of expansion slots. Determine whether they match the
existing adapter cards. For example, the new motherboard might lack an Accelerated
Graphics Port (AGP) connector for an existing video adapter. The motherboard might have
PCI Express (PCIe) expansion slots that the existing adapter cards cannot use. Finally, the
new motherboard must physically fit into the current computer case.

Figure 11-5
Motherboard
10
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Select the CPU and Heat Sink/Fan Assembly
Replace the CPU when it fails or is no longer adequate for the current applications. For
example, you might have a customer who has purchased an advanced graphics application.
The application might run poorly because it requires a faster processor than the current CPU.
Before you buy a CPU, make sure that it is compatible with the existing motherboard:
■The new CPU must use the same socket type and chipset.
■The BIOS must support the new CPU.
■The new CPU might require a different heat sink/fan assembly.
Manufacturers’ websites are a good resource to investigate the compatibility between CPUs
and other devices. When upgrading the CPU, make sure that the correct voltage is main-
tained. A voltage regulator module (VRM) is integrated into the motherboard. The voltage
setting for the CPU can be configured with jumpers or switches located on the mother-
board. Figure 11-6 shows two similar CPUs that use different sockets. 
Select RAM
New random-access memory (RAM) might be needed when an application locks up or if
the computer displays frequent error messages. To determine whether the problem is the
RAM, replace the old RAM module, as shown in Figure 11-7. Restart the computer to see
whether the application runs properly.

Figure 11-6
Incompatible CPUs with Similar Capabilities
Chapter 11: Advanced Personal Computers

Figure 11-7
RAM Module
To close a stalled application, press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to open the Task Manager. In the win-
dow, select the application. Click End Task to close it, as shown in Figure 11-8.
When selecting new RAM, you must ensure that it is compatible with the current mother-
board. It must also be the same type of RAM as installed in the computer. The speed of the
new RAM must be the same or faster than the existing RAM. It can help to take the original
memory module with you when you shop for the replacement RAM.

Figure 11-8
Task Manager
12
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Primary memory (RAM) is controlled by the OS. Bad RAM will show up in the power-on
self test (POST) as not being counted. RAM will only need to be replaced when it is too
slow or insufficiently large enough to accommodate the application. The OS will accommo-
date the application by increasing the virtual memory requirement, and hard disk thrashing
will occur. 
Select Adapter Cards
Adapter cards, also called expansion cards, add extra functionality to a computer. Figure
11-9 shows some of the adapter cards available. Before you purchase an adapter card, do
some research:
■Is there an open expansion slot?
■Is the adapter card compatible with the open slot?
If the motherboard does not have compatible expansion slots, external devices can be an
option:
■Are USB or FireWire versions of the external device available?
■Does the computer have an open USB or FireWire port?
Consider the following situation for an adapter card upgrade. A customer requires a wire-
less card to connect to the network. The new wireless adapter card must be compatible with
the existing wireless network and with the computer.
Investigate wireless network interface cards (NIC) before you purchase one. You should
ensure that the new wireless NIC is compatible with the 802.11 wireless standard being
used on the wireless network.

Figure 11-9
Adapter Cards
Chapter 11: Advanced Personal Computers
13
Wireless NIC
NIC
Video Adapter
Examine the computer for an available expansion slot or an open USB port. Purchase either
an adapter card that will fit an available expansion slot or a USB wireless NIC. Cost, war-
ranty, brand name, and availability are the last factors for you to consider. 
Select Storage Devices and Hard Drives
You might need to replace a hard drive when it no longer meets your customer’s needs for
data storage or fails. The signs that a hard drive is failing include
■Unusual noises
■Error messages
■Corrupt data or applications
If your hard drive exhibits any of these symptoms, you should replace it as soon as possible.
Figure 11-10 shows Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA), Serial Advanced
Technology Attachment (SATA), and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) connectors.
ATA was renamed Parallel ATA, or PATA, with the introduction of Serial ATA (SATA).
PATA hard drives can use a 40-pin, 80-conductor cable or a 40-pin, 40-conductor cable.
SATA hard drives connect to the motherboard using a serial interface. SATA hard drives
have a higher data-transfer rate than PATA drives. The smaller data cable allows improved
airflow through the computer case. Early versions of SATA offered a speed of 1.5 Gbps.
Current versions offer a speed of 3.0 Gbps.
The SCSI standard is typically used for hard drives and for tape storage. However, printers,
scanners, CD-ROM drives, and DVD drives can also use SCSI. Today, SCSI devices are
used mostly on servers or computers that require high transfer speeds and reliability.

Figure 11-10 Hard Drive Connectors
14
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
SCSI is a more advanced interface controller than PATA or SATA. It is ideal for high-end
computers, including network servers. Devices can include hard drives, CD-ROM drives,
tape drives, scanners, and removable drives. SCSI devices are typically connected in a
series, forming a chain that is commonly called a daisy chain, as shown in Figure 11-11.
Each end of the daisy chain must be terminated to prevent signals from bouncing off the
ends of cables and causing interference. Generally, the SCSI controller on one end of the
SCSI bus has on-board termination. The other end of the SCSI cable is either terminated by
a resistor on the last drive on the chain or a physical terminator on the end of the SCSI bus.
Figure 11-11 SCSI Daisy Chain

Most SCSI buses can handle a total of seven devices and a SCSI controller. The channels
are numbered from 0 through 7. Some versions of SCSI support a total of 15 devices plus
the SCSI controller. These channels are numbered 0 through 15. Each device on a SCSI
channel must have a unique SCSI ID. For example, the primary drive would be 0 and the
controller card is usually 7. The SCSI ID is generally set by jumpers on a SCSI drive.
The SCSI bus was originally 8 bits wide and operated at a transfer rate of 5 MBps. Later
SCSI technologies used a 16-bit bus and operated at 320–640 MBps. Table 11-1 shows the
different types of SCSIs. Current and future SCSI technologies use a serial interface for
increased speed.

Select Input and Output Devices
An input device can be any piece of equipment that transfers information into a computer:
■Mouse
■Keyboard
■Scanner
■Camera
■Process control sensor
■MIDI interface
■Microphone
An output device transfers information to the outside of the computer:
■Display monitor
■Projector
■Printer
■Process-control equipment
■Speaker
To select input and output devices, you should first find out what the customer wants. Next,
you should select the hardware and software by researching the Internet for possible solu-
tions. After you determine which input or output device the customer needs, you must
determine how to connect it to the computer. Figures 11-12 shows common input and out-
put port symbols.
Figure 11-12 Common Input and Output Port Symbols

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Technicians should have a good understanding of several types of interfaces:
■USB 1.1: Transfers data at a maximum speed of 12 Mbps.
■USB 2.0: Transfers data at a maximum speed of 480 Mbps.
■IEEE 1394 (FireWire): Transfers data at 100, 200, or 400 Mbps.
■Parallel (IEEE 1284): Transfers data at a maximum speed of 3 Mbps.
■Serial (RS-232): Early versions were limited to 20 kbps, but newer versions can reach
transfer rates of 1.5 Mbps.
■SCSI (Ultra-320 SCSI): Connects as many as 15 devices with a transfer rate of 320
Mbps.

Upgrade and Configure Personal Computer
Components and Peripherals
Computer systems need periodic upgrades for various reasons:
■User requirements change.
■Upgraded software packages require new hardware.
■New hardware offers enhanced performance.
Changes to the computer can cause you to upgrade or replace components and peripherals.
You should research the effectiveness and cost for both options: upgrading and replacing.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Upgrade and configure a motherboard
■Upgrade and configure a CPU and a heat sink/fan assembly
■Upgrade and configure RAM
■Upgrade and configure BIOS
■Upgrade and configure storage devices and hard drives
■Upgrade and configure input and output devices
Figure 11-13 shows some of the different components and peripherals to upgrade.

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Upgrade and Configure a Motherboard
To upgrade or replace a motherboard, you might have to replace several other components,
such as the CPU, heat sink/fan assembly, and RAM. Figure 11-14 shows an example of an
old motherboard and a replacement/new motherboard.
Figure 11-14 Motherboards
A new motherboard must fit into the old computer case. The power supply must also be
compatible with the new motherboard and be able to support all new computer compo-
nents.

You should begin the upgrade by moving the CPU and heat sink/fan assembly to the new
motherboard. These are much easier to work with when they are outside of the case. You
should work on an antistatic mat and wear a wrist strap to avoid damaging the CPU.
Remember to use thermal compound between the CPU and the heat sink. If the new moth-
erboard requires different RAM, install it at this time.
When it is time to remove and replace the old motherboard, remove the cables from the
motherboard that attach to the case LEDs and buttons. They can have the same labels, but
there might be minor differences. Make the appropriate notes in your journal to know where
and how everything is connected before you start the upgrade.
Note how the motherboard secures to the case. Some mounting screws provide support, and
some can provide an important grounding connection between the motherboard and chassis.
In particular, you should pay attention to screws and standoffs that are nonmetallic. These
can be insulators. Replacing insulating screws and supports with metal hardware that con-
ducts electricity can have disastrous results.
Make sure that you use the correct screws. Do not swap threaded screws with self-tapping
metal screws; they will damage the threaded screw holes and might not be secure. Make
sure that threaded screws are the correct length and have the same number of threads per
inch. If the thread is correct, they will fit easily. You can make a screw fit by using force,
but you will damage the threaded hole and the screw will not hold the motherboard secure-
ly. Using the wrong screw can also produce metal shavings that can cause short circuits. 
Note
It does not matter whether you replace a flat head screw with a Phillips head screw, as long as the
threaded part of the screw is the same length and has the same number of threads.
Next you should connect the power supply cables. If the Advanced Technology eXtended
(ATX) power connectors are not the same size (some have more pins), you might need to
use an adapter. Connect the cables for the case LEDs and buttons.
After the new motherboard is in place and cabled, you should install and secure all expan-
sion cards. Check your work. Make sure that there are no loose parts or leftover wires.
Connect a keyboard, mouse, monitor, and power. If there is any sign of trouble, you should
shut the power supply off immediately.
Do not forget that an expansion card can have the same functionality that is integrated into
the motherboard. In this case, you might need to disable the on-board functions in the sys-
tem BIOS. Use the documentation that came with the motherboard to learn what BIOS
adjustments might be required.
Chapter 11: Advanced Personal Computers

Lab 11.4.1: Install a NIC
In this lab, you install a NIC and disable an integrated motherboard network adapter. Refer
to the lab in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third
Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can perform this lab now or wait until the end of the
chapter. 
Upgrade and Configure a CPU and a Heat Sink/Fan
Assembly
One way to increase the apparent power of a computer is to increase the processing speed.
You can often do this by upgrading the central processing unit (CPU). However, there are
some requirements that you must meet:
■The new CPU must fit into the existing CPU socket.
■The new CPU must be compatible with the motherboard chipset.
■The new CPU must operate with the existing motherboard and power supply.
■The new CPU must operate with the existing RAM. The RAM might need to be
upgraded or expanded to take advantage of the faster CPU.
If the motherboard is older, you might not be able to find a compatible CPU. In that case,
you would replace the motherboard.
Caution
Always work on an antistatic mat and wear a wrist strap when installing and removing CPUs. Place a
CPU on the antistatic mat until you are ready to use it. Store CPUs in antistatic packaging.
To change the CPU, you should remove the existing CPU by releasing it from the socket
using the zero insertion force (ZIF) lever. Different sockets have slightly different mecha-
nisms, but all serve to lock the CPU in place after it is correctly oriented in the socket. 
Insert the new CPU into place. Do not force the CPU into its socket, or use excessive force
to close the locking bars. Excessive force can damage the CPU or its socket. If you
encounter resistance, make sure that you have aligned the CPU properly. Most have a pat-
tern of pins that will fit only one way. If there is a question, examine the new CPU to
ensure that it is physically similar to the old one.
The new CPU might require a different heat sink/fan assembly. The heat sink/fan assembly,
as shown in Figure 11-15, must physically fit the CPU and be compatible with the CPU socket.
The heat sink/fan assembly must also be adequate to remove the heat of the faster CPU.
20
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Figure 11-15 CPU and Heat Sink/Fan Assembly
Chapter 11: Advanced Personal Computers
21
Note
You must apply thermal compound between the new CPU and the heat sink/fan assembly. This is
because the surface of the heat sink and CPU is not entirely flat, and if you place the heat sink direct-
ly on the CPU, there might be gaps that you cannot see. Air conducts heat poorly, and the gaps have
a negative effect on heat transfer. By applying a thermal compound that has a high thermal conduc-
tivity, you improve the heat conductivity between the heat sink and CPU.
With some types of BIOS, you can view thermal settings to determine whether there are any
problems with the CPU and the heat sink/fan assembly. Third-party software applications
can report CPU temperature information in an easy-to-read format. Refer to the mother-
board or CPU user documentation to determine whether the chip is operating in the correct
temperature range. Some CPU and case fans turn on and off automatically depending on the
CPU temperature and the internal case temperature. The temperatures are measured through
thermal probes built into the fan assembly, or internal circuitry in the CPU. 
Upgrade and Configure RAM
Increasing the amount of system RAM almost always improves overall system performance.
Prior to upgrading or replacing the RAM, there are some questions you must answer:
■What type of RAM does the motherboard currently use?
■Can the RAM be installed one module at a time, or should it be grouped into matching
banks?
■Are there any available RAM slots?
■Does the new RAM chip match the speed, latency, type, and voltage of the existing RAM?

Caution
When working with system RAM, work on an antistatic mat and wear a wrist strap. Place the RAM
on the mat until you are ready to install it. Store RAM in antistatic packaging.
Remove the existing RAM by freeing retaining clips that secure it. Pull it from the socket.
Current dual-inline memory modules (DIMM) pull straight out and insert straight down.
Earlier single-inline memory modules (SIMM) were inserted at an angle to lock into place.
Insert the new RAM, as shown in Figure 11-16, and lock it into place with the retaining
clips.
Figure 11-16 Installing RAM
22
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Caution
Make sure to insert the memory module completely into the socket. RAM can cause serious damage
to the motherboard if it is incorrectly aligned and shorts the main system bus.
The system discovers the newly installed RAM if it is compatible and installed correctly. If
the BIOS does not indicate the presence of the correct amount of RAM, check to make sure
that the RAM is compatible with the motherboard and is correctly installed.
Lab 11.4.3: Install Additional RAM
In this lab, you install additional RAM in the computer. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials:
PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6).
You can perform this lab now or wait until the end of the chapter. 

Upgrade and Configure BIOS
Motherboard manufacturers periodically release updates for their basic input/output system
(BIOS). The release notes describe the upgrade to the product, compatibility improvements,
and the known bugs that have been addressed. Some newer devices only operate properly
with an updated BIOS.
Early computer BIOS information was contained in ROM chips. To upgrade the BIOS
information, the ROM chip had to be replaced, which was not always possible. Modern
BIOS chips are EEPROM, or flash memory, which can be upgraded by the user without
opening the computer case. This process is called flashing the BIOS.
To view the current BIOS settings on your computer, you must enter the BIOS setup pro-
gram as shown in Figure 11-17. Press the setup sequence keys while the computer is per-
forming the POST. Depending on the computer, the setup key might be F1, F2, or Delete.
Watch the text on the screen or consult the motherboard manual to find the setup key or
combination of keys.
Figure 11-17 BIOS Version
Chapter 11: Advanced Personal Computers
23
The first part of the boot process displays a message that tells you which key to press to
enter the setup, or BIOS, mode. There are a variety of settings in the BIOS that should not
be altered by anyone unfamiliar with this procedure. If you are unsure, it is best not to
change any BIOS setting unless you research the problem in depth.
To download a new BIOS, consult the manufacturer’s website and follow the recommended
installation procedures. Installing BIOS software online can involve downloading a new
BIOS file, copying or extracting files to a floppy disk, and then booting from the floppy. An
installation program prompts the user for information to complete the process. Some newer
programs will do a BIOS update without the need to create a floppy disk. The BIOS will be
updated after you reboot your computer.

Although it is still common to flash the BIOS through a command prompt, several mother-
board manufacturers provide software on their websites that allow a user to flash the BIOS
from within Windows. The procedure varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.
Caution
An improperly installed or aborted BIOS update can cause the computer to become unusable.
Lab 11.4.4: BIOS File Search
In this lab, you search for newer BIOS versions. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC
Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You
can perform this lab now or wait until the end of the chapter. 
Upgrade and Configure Storage Devices and Hard
Drives
Instead of purchasing a new computer to get increased access speed and storage space, you
can consider adding another hard drive. There are several reasons for installing an addition-
al drive:
■To install a second operating system
■To provide additional storage space
■To provide a faster hard drive
■To hold the system swap file
■To provide a backup for the original hard drive
■To increase fault tolerance
If the new drive is PATA and is on the same data cable, one of the drives must be set as the
master drive and the other must be set as the slave drive. Figure 11-18 shows jumper set-
tings on the back of a PATA hard drive. Also, any new partitions or drive letter assignments
should be well planned. The boot order in the BIOS might need to be adjusted.
Figure 11-18 Hard Drive Jumper Settings
24
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Arrays, such as a Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID), improve fault tolerance
when connecting multiple hard drives, as shown in Figure 11-19. Some types of RAID
require two or more hard drives. You can install RAID using hardware or software.
Hardware installations are usually more dependable but are more expensive. Software
installations are created and managed by an operating system, such as Windows Server
2003.

Lab 11.4.5: Install, Configure, and Partition a Second Hard Drive
In this lab, you install and configure a second hard drive. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials:
PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6).
You can perform this lab now or wait until the end of the chapter. 
Upgrade and Configure Input and Output Devices
If an input or output device stops operating, you might have to replace the device. Some
customers might want to upgrade their input or output devices to increase performance and
productivity.
An ergonomic keyboard, shown in Figure 11-20, can be more comfortable to use.
Sometimes a reconfiguration is necessary to enable a user to perform special tasks, such as
typing in a second language with additional characters. Finally, replacing or reconfiguring
an input or output device can make it easier to accommodate users with disabilities.
Sometimes it is not possible to perform an upgrade using the existing expansion slots or
sockets. In this case, you might be able to accomplish the upgrade using a USB connection.
If the computer does not have an extra USB connection, you must install a USB adapter
card or purchase a USB hub, as shown in Figure 11-21.

Figure 11-20 Ergonomic Wireless Keyboard and Mouse

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Figure 11-21 USB Hub
After obtaining new hardware, you might have to install new drivers. You can usually do
this by using the installation CD. If you do not have the CD, you can obtain updated drivers
from the website of the manufacturer.
Note
A signed driver is a driver that has passed the Windows hardware quality lab test and has been given
a driver signature by Microsoft. Installing an unsigned driver can cause system instability, error mes-
sages, and boot problems. During hardware installation, if an unsigned driver is detected, you will be
asked whether you want to continue installation of this driver.

Identify and Apply Common Preventive
Maintenance Techniques for Personal
Computer Components
To keep computers working properly, you must maintain them by performing preventive
maintenance. Preventive maintenance can extend the life of the components, protect data,
and improve computer performance.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Clean internal components
■Clean the case
■Inspect computer components
Clean Internal Components
One important part of computer preventive maintenance is to keep the system clean. The
amount of dust in the environment and the habits of the user determine how often to clean
the computer components. Most of your cleaning is to prevent the accumulation of dust.
To remove dust, do not use a vacuum cleaner. Vacuum cleaners can generate static and can
damage or loosen components and jumpers. Instead, you should use compressed air to blow
the dust away. If you use compressed air from a can, keep the can upright to prevent the
fluid from leaking onto computer components. Always follow the instructions and warnings
on the compressed air can.
Regular cleaning also gives you a chance to inspect components for loose screws and con-
nectors. There are several parts inside the computer case that you should keep as clean as
possible:
■Heat sink/fan assembly
■RAM
■Adapter cards
■Motherboard
■Case fan
■Power supply
■Internal drives
Caution
When you clean a fan with compressed air, hold the fan blades in place. This prevents overspinning
the rotor or moving the fan in the wrong direction. 
Chapter 11: Advanced Personal Computers
27

Clean the Case
Dust or dirt on the outside of a computer can travel through cooling fans and loose comput-
er case covers. Dirt can also enter a computer through missing expansion slot covers, as
shown in Figure 11-22. If dust accumulates inside the computer, it can prevent the flow of
air and affect cooling.
Figure 11-22 Cleaning the Computer Case
28
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Use a cloth or duster to clean the outside of the computer case. If you use a cleaning prod-
uct, do not spray it directly on the case. Instead, put a small amount onto a cleaning cloth or
duster and wipe the outside of the case.
While cleaning the case, you should look for and correct things that might cause a problem
later:
■Missing expansion slot covers that let dust, dirt, or living pests into the computer
■Loose or missing screws that secure adapter cards
■Missing or tangled cables that can pull free from the case
Inspect Computer Components
The best method of keeping a computer in good condition is to examine the computer on a
regular schedule. Cleaning provides a good opportunity to make this inspection. You should
have a checklist of components to inspect, as described in the following sections.

CPU and Cooling System
Examine the CPU and cooling system for dust buildup. Make sure that the fan can spin
freely. Check that the fan power cable is secure, as shown in Figure 11-23. Check the fan
while the power is on to see the fan turn. Inspect the CPU to be sure that it is seated secure-
ly in the socket. Make sure that the heat sink is well attached. To avoid damage, do not
remove the CPU for cleaning.
Figure 11-23 Loose Heat Sink/Fan Assembly Connector
Chapter 11: Advanced Personal Computers
29
RAM Connections
The RAM chips, as shown in Figure 11-24, should be seated securely in the RAM slots.
Sometimes the retaining clips can loosen. Reseat them, if necessary. Use compressed air to
remove any dust. 
Storage Devices
Inspect all storage devices including the hard drives, floppy drive, optical drives, and tape
drive. All cables should be firmly connected. Check for loose, missing, or incorrectly set
jumpers, as shown in Figure 11-25. A drive should not produce rattling, knocking, or grind-
ing sounds. Read the manufacturer’s manual to learn how to clean optical drive and tape
heads by using cotton swabs and compressed air. Clean floppy drives with a drive 
cleaning kit.

Figure 11-24 RAM Chips
30
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Figure 11-25 Hard Drive Jumpers
Adapter Cards
Adapter cards should be seated properly in their expansion slots. Loose cards, as shown in
Figure 11-26, can cause short circuits. Secure adapter cards with the retaining screw to
avoid the cards coming loose in their expansion slots. Use compressed air to remove any
dirt or dust on the adapter cards or the expansion slots.

Figure 11-26 Loose Adapter Card
Chapter 11: Advanced Personal Computers
31
Note
The video adapter can sometimes become unseated because the large monitor cable can put pressure
on it, or it is mishandled when someone is tightening the retainer screws. If a video adapter is used in
an expansion slot, the integrated video adapter from the motherboard is likely to be disabled. If you
connect a monitor to it in error, the computer appears not to work.
Power Devices
Inspect power strips, surge suppressors (surge protectors), and uninterruptible power supply
(UPS) devices. Make sure that there is proper and unobstructed ventilation. Replace the
power strip if there have been electrical problems or excessive thunderstorms in the area.
Loose Screws
Loose screws can cause problems if they are not immediately fixed or removed. A loose
screw in the case can later cause a short circuit or can roll into a position where the screw is
hard to remove.
Keyboard and Mouse
Use compressed air or a small vacuum cleaner to clean the keyboard and mouse. If the
mouse is the mechanical type, remove the ball and clean off any dirt.
Cables
Examine all cable connections. Look for broken and bent pins. Ensure that all connector
retaining screws are finger tight. Make sure cables are not crimped, pinched, or severely bent.

Troubleshoot Computer Components and
Peripherals
The troubleshooting process helps resolve problems with the computer or peripherals.
These problems range from simple, such as updating a drive, to more complex problems,
such as installing a CPU. Use the troubleshooting steps as a guideline to help you diagnose
and repair problems.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Review the troubleshooting process
■Identify common problems and solutions
■Apply troubleshooting skills
Review the Troubleshooting Process
Computer technicians must be able to analyze the problem and determine the cause of the
error to repair the computer. This process is called troubleshooting.
The first step in the troubleshooting process is to gather data from the customer.
Ask the customer open-ended questions about computer errors. Examples are shown in the
following list. (This list is not comprehensive.)
■Can you describe precisely what happens when the computer boots?
■How often does the computer fail to start?
■What is the first screen you see when you turn on your computer?
■What sound does the computer make as it starts?
■Is there a pause, or does the computer restart instantly?
Also ask the customer closed-ended questions about computer errors. (This list is not com-
prehensive.)
■Has anyone done any repair work on the computer recently?
■Has anyone else used the computer?
■Does this computer have a floppy drive?
■Does this computer have a USB drive installed?
■Is there a wireless NIC in this computer?
■Is the computer turned off at night?
■Is the computer secured in a locked room at night?
■Do you have a Windows XP installation CD on hand?
32
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

After you have talked to the customer, you should verify the obvious issues. Issues that
apply to computer hardware include the following:
■Are all the cables to this computer tightly in their sockets? 
■Is the power cord firmly seated at both ends?
■Is the cable that connects the computer to the monitor squarely seated in its socket with
the thumbscrews finger tight?
■Are any of the rear-panel expansion-slot covers loose so that the adapter cards could
have loosened?
■Was the computer recently dropped or jarred?
■Are there any missing screws or signs that the computer has been tampered with?
After you have verified the obvious issues, try some quick solutions to computer hardware
problems:
■Check the external cables for loose connections that could cause a restart.
■Check the internal data and power cables for loose connections.
■Ensure that adapter cards and RAM are properly secured.
■Verify that all cooling fans are operating properly.
If quick solutions did not correct the problem, it is time to gather data from the computer.
Some different ways to gather information about the problem from the computer include the
following:
■You cannot access Safe Mode from the startup menu.
■The computer boots from a Windows startup disk.
■You can access the hard drive. 
At this point, you have enough information to evaluate the problem and research and imple-
ment possible solutions. When researching possible solutions for a problem, use the follow-
ing sources of information:
■Problem-solving experience
■Other technicians
■Internet search
■Newsgroups
■Manufacturer FAQs
■Computer manuals
■Device manuals
Chapter 11: Advanced Personal Computers
33

■Online forums
■Technical websites
After you have solved the problem, close with the customer. Tasks required to complete this
step include the following:
■Discuss the solution implemented with customer.
■Have the customer verify that the problem has been solved.
■Provide the customer with all paperwork.
■Document steps taken to solve the problem in the work order and the technician’s
journal. 
■Document any components used in the repair.
■Document the time spent to resolve the problem.
Identify Common Problems and Solutions
Computer problems can be attributed to hardware, software, networks, or some combination
of the three. You will resolve some types of computer problems more often than others.
Table 11-2 is a chart of common hardware problems and solutions.

There are various brands of operating systems available on the market today, including
Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, UNIX, and Linux. A technician must consider the cur-
rent computer system when selecting an operating system. Additionally, there are several
versions or distributions of an operating system. Some versions of Microsoft Windows
include Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP
Professional, Windows Media Center, Windows Vista Home Basic, Windows Vista
Business, and Windows Vista Premium.
Each of these operating systems offers many of the same features with a similar interface.
However, some functions necessary for specific customer needs might not be available in all
of them. You must be able to compare and contrast operating systems to find the best one
based on your customer’s needs.
Select the Appropriate Operating System
Based on Customer Needs
There are many operating systems to choose from, each with features that should be consid-
ered when consulting with a customer. When selecting an operating system for a customer,
you should select hardware that meets or exceeds the minimum requirements for equipment
called for by the operating system.
In this chapter, Windows XP Professional is used to describe the functions of an operating
system. At some point during your career, you will most likely upgrade or repair a comput-
er with a Windows operating system.

■Network access and security
■Redundant storage systems, such as Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)
and backups
Network operating systems provide several protocols designed to perform network func-
tions. These protocols are controlled by code on the network servers. Protocols used by net-
work operating systems provide services such as web browsing, file transfer, e-mail, name
resolution, and automatic IP addressing. Network protocols include
■HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol): Defines how files are exchanged on the web
■FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Provides services for file transfer and manipulation
■POP (Post Office Protocol): Retrieves e-mail messages from an e-mail server
■DNS (Domain Name System): Resolves URLs for websites with their IP addresses
■DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol): Automates assignment of IP addresses
Install, Configure, and Optimize an Operating
System
Most operating systems are easy to install. After the computer starts, the Windows XP
Professional installation CD displays a wizard, as shown in Figure 12-1, to guide you
through the installation process with a series of questions. After the answers to the ques-
tions are provided, the installation wizard completes the installation automatically. In the
following sections, you will perform a custom installation of Windows XP Professional.
Figure 12-1
Windows XP Installation
Chapter 12: Advanced Operating Systems

After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Compare and contrast a default installation and a custom installation.
■Install Windows XP Professional using a custom installation.
■Create, view, and manage disks, directories, and files.
■Identify procedures and utilities used to optimize the performance of operating
systems.
■Identify procedures and utilities used to optimize the performance of browsers.
■Describe the installation, use, and configuration of e-mail software. 
■Set screen resolution and update the video driver.
■Describe the installation of a second operating system.
Compare and Contrast a Default Installation and a
Custom Installation
The default installation of Windows XP Professional is sufficient for most computers used
in a home or small office network. A custom installation of Windows XP Professional is
typically used in a larger network.
Default installation requires minimal user interaction. You are prompted to provide infor-
mation for the specific computer and the owner/user.
In Windows XP, the custom installation is similar to the default installation. There are only
two screens that offer a custom selection during setup. The first screen allows you to cus-
tomize the regional settings, and the second screen (shown in Figure 12-2) allows you to
customize the network settings. 
Figure 12-2
Windows Installations Types

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

A technician or a user with technical experience often performs the custom installation. In a
custom installation, the wizard prompts the user for detailed performance information to
ensure that the operating system is customized to meet the preferences or requirements of
the individual user or the network administrator of a company. You can perform a custom
Windows XP Professional installation on more than one computer on a network by using an
answer file that contains predefined settings and answers to the questions that are asked by
the wizard during setup.
The technician can automate and customize a Windows XP Professional installation to
include the following features:
■Productivity applications, such as Microsoft Office
■Custom applications
■Support for multiple languages
■OS Deployment Feature Pack using Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS)
■Hardware device drivers
Install Windows XP Professional Using a Custom
Installation
A custom installation of Windows XP Professional can save time and provide a consistent
configuration of the operating system across computers on a large network.
The most common types of custom installations are as follows:
■Unattended installation from a network distribution point using an answer file.
■Image-based installation using Sysprep and a disk-imaging program, which copies an
image of the operating system directly to the hard drive with no user intervention.
■Remote installation using Remote Installation Services (RIS), which can download the
installation across the network. This install can be requested by the user or forced onto
the computer by the administrator.
■OS Deployment Feature Pack using Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS),
which can dramatically simplify deployment of an operating system across the organi-
zation.
The sections that follow describe these different custom installation methods in more detail.
Unattended Installation
The unattended installation using an unattend.txt answer file is the easiest custom installa-
tion method to perform on a network. An answer file can be created using an application
Chapter 12: Advanced Operating Systems
7

called setupmgr.exe, which is located within the deploy.cab file on the Windows XP
Professional CD. 
Figure 12-3 shows an example of an answer file.
Figure 12-3
Sample Answer File
8
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
After you have answered all the questions, the unattend.txt file is copied to the distribution
shared folder on a server. At this point, you can do one of two things:
■Run the unattended.bat file on the client machine. This prepares the hard drive and
automatically installs the operating system from the server over the network.
■Create a boot disk that boots up the computer and connects to the distribution share on
the server. Run the batch file to install the operating system over the network.
Image-Based Installation
When performing image-based installations, you should begin by completely configuring
one computer to an operational state. Next, run Sysprep to prepare the system for imaging.
A third-party drive-imaging application prepares an image of the completed computer that
can be burned onto a CD or DVD. This image can then be copied onto computers with
compatible hardware abstraction layers (HAL) to complete the installation of multiple com-
puters. After the image has been copied, you can boot up the computer, but you might have
to configure some settings, such as computer name and domain membership.
Remote Installation
With Remote Installation Service (RIS), the process is very much like an image-based
installation, except you would not use a drive-imaging utility. You can use RIS to remotely

set up new Microsoft Windows computers by using an RIS network shared folder as the
source of the Windows operating system files. You can install operating systems on remote
boot-enabled client computers. User computers that are connected to the network can be
started by using a Pre-Boot eXecution Environment (PXE)–capable network adapter or
remote boot disk. The client then logs on with valid user account credentials.
RIS is designed to be used in a relatively small network and should not be used over low-
speed links of a wide-area network (WAN). Microsoft System Management Server (SMS)
allows a network administrator to manage large numbers of computers on a network. SMS
can be used to manage updates, provide remote control, and perform inventory manage-
ment. An optional feature is operating system deployment, which requires the installation of
the SMS OS Deployment Feature Pack on the Windows 2003 server. SMS allows the instal-
lation of a large number of client computers across the entire network, such as a LAN or
WAN.
Lab 12.2.2: Advanced Installation of Windows XP
In this lab, you will install a Windows XP Professional operating system by using an
answer file for automation. You will customize partition settings and create an administra-
tive user and limited users. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software
Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can perform this lab now
or wait until the end of the chapter.
Create, View, and Manage Disks, Directories, and Files
Within the operating system, disks and directories are locations where data is stored and
organized. The file system used by the operating system determines additional factors that
affect storage such as partition size, cluster size, and security features.
Disk Structure
The Disk Management utility displays information and performs services such as partition-
ing and formatting disks in Windows. Figure 12-4 shows the Disk Management utility used
in Windows XP.
You can access the Disk Management utility in the following ways:
■From the Start menu, right-click My Computer and then choose Manage > Disk
Management.
■From the Start menu, choose Settings > Control Panel > Administrative Tools >
Computer Management. Double-click Storage, and then double-click Disk
Management.

There are several types of partitions on a hard drive:
■Primary partitions
■Extended partitions
■Logical drives
Note
At any given time, you can only designate one partition as the active partition. The operating system
uses the active partition to boot up the system. The active partition must be a primary partition.
In most cases, the C: drive is the active partition and contains the boot and system files.
Some users create additional partitions to organize files or to be able to dual-boot the com-
puter.
File System
Partitions are formatted with a file system. The two file systems available in Windows XP
are FAT32 and NTFS. NTFS has greater stability and security features.
For example, Windows does not display the file extension, but this practice can cause secu-
rity problems. Virus writers are able to distribute executable files disguised as nonexe-
cutable files. To avoid this security breach, you should always show file extensions. To do

so, choose Start > Control Panel > Folder Options > View and deselect the Hide exten-
sions for known file types check box, as shown in Figure 12-5.
Figure 12-5
Showing File Extensions
Chapter 12: Advanced Operating Systems

Note
Saving files to the root directory of the C: drive can cause organizational problems with data. It is a
best practice to store data in folders created on the C: drive.
Lab 12.2.3: Additional Partitions
In this lab, you will create a FAT32-formatted partition on a disk. You will convert the parti-
tion to NTFS. You will identify the differences between the FAT32 format and the NTFS
format. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study
Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can perform this lab now or wait until the
end of the chapter. 
Identify Procedures and Utilities Used to Optimize the
Performance of Operating Systems
There are several procedures and tools available to optimize the performance of an operat-
ing system. The concepts can be the same across operating systems, but the optimization
methods and procedures are different. For example, while virtual memory performs the

same function in the Windows 98 and Windows XP operating systems, the path to find and
set virtual memory settings is different.
System Tools
To maintain and optimize an operating system, you can access various tools within
Windows. Some of these tools include disk error checking, which can scan the hard drive
for file structure errors, and hard drive defragmentation, which can consolidate files for
faster access.
To access the hard drive management tools in Windows XP, in Windows Explorer, right-
click Local Disk (C:) and select Properties from the resulting drop-down menu. Select the
Tools tab from the Properties dialog box. Figure 12-6 shows the options on the Tools tab,
with the Defragmentation tool activated.
Figure 12-6
Hard Drive Management Tools
12
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Virtual Memory
Virtual memory allows the CPU to address more memory than is installed in the computer.
This is done so that every application can address the same amount of memory. Virtual
memory is a swap file or page file that is constantly read into and out of RAM. Typically,
you should let Windows manage the size of the swap file. The only setting that you should

change is the location of the swap file. You must be a member of the administrator group to
make this change. To access virtual memory settings in Windows XP, use one of the follow-
ing paths:
■Start > Settings > Control Panel > System > Advanced tab > Performance Options
■Start > Control Panel > Performance and Maintenance > System > Advanced >
Performance > Settings > Advanced
Figure 12-7 shows virtual memory settings.
Figure 12-7
Virtual Memory
Chapter 12: Advanced Operating Systems
13
Disk Defragmenter
To help optimize the files on the hard drive, Windows operating systems provide the Disk
Defragmenter utility. As files are accessed and stored on a hard drive, the files change from
being contiguous on the disk to being scattered across the disk. This can cause the operating
system to slow down. The hard drive has to search several areas on the hard drive platter to
find the entire file. For one file, the effect of the process is minimal. When this occurs for
thousands of files, however, the process will slow the reading and writing of a file to a hard
drive. To defragment a drive, double-click My Computer on the desktop. Right-click the
drive that you want to optimize, and choose Properties. On the Tools tab, click
Defragment Now. Figure 12-6 showed the Disk Defragmenter interface.

Temporary Files
Almost every program uses temporary files, which are usually automatically deleted when
the application or the operating system is finished using them. However, some of the tem-
porary files must be deleted manually. Because temporary files take up hard drive space that
could be used for other files, it is a good idea to check and delete them as necessary every
two or three months. Temporary files are usually located in the following locations:
■C:\temp
■C:\tmp
■C:\windows\temp
■C:\windows\tmp
■C:\documents and settings\%USERPROFILE%\local settings\temp
Services
Services are a type of application that runs in the background to achieve a specific goal or
wait for a request. Only necessary services should be started to reduce unnecessary security
risks.
To access the services in Windows XP, click Start and then right-click My Computer and
select Manage. Click the plus sign next to Services and Applications and then click
Services, as shown in Figure 12-8.
Figure 12-8
Services
14
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
There are four settings, or states, that can be used to control the services:
■Automatic
■Manual

■Disabled
■Stopped
If a service, such as DHCP or Automatic Updates, is set to Automatic, it will start up when
the PC starts. Manual services, such as the support of an uninterruptible power supply
(UPS), need to be manually configured to work. Some services can be stopped or disabled
for troubleshooting purposes, such as turning off the print spooler when there are printer
problems.
Lab 12.2.4: Customize Virtual Memory Settings
In this lab, you will customize virtual memory settings. You will customize the Startup fold-
er and RunOnce key in the registry. You will change the default Windows Update option.
Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third
Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can perform this lab now or wait until the end of the
chapter. 
Identify Procedures and Utilities Used to Optimize the
Performance of Browsers
Web browsers and e-mail applications are typically the applications used the most on a
computer. Optimizing the web browsers and the e-mail application should increase the per-
formance of the computer.
The Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer (IE), has general settings for changing the home
page and browser appearance settings. Additional settings allow you to view or delete the
information saved by the browser:
■History
■Temporary files
■Cookies
■Passwords
■Web-form information
Note
Cookies hold information transmitted between a web browser and a web server with the purpose of
tracking user information to customize the page delivered to the user.
To access the settings in IE, open an IE browser window and choose Tools > Internet
Options, as shown in Figure 12-9. The list that follows describes the settings you can
access from the tabs in this window.
Chapter 12: Advanced Operating Systems
15

Figure 12-9
Internet Explorer Options
16
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
■General: Used to set the home page, view and delete temporary Internet files, and
change the browser appearance settings
■Security: Used to select Internet zones and trusted sites
■Privacy: Used for privacy settings to block third-party cookies and pop-ups
■Content: Used to block unwanted website content and set identification and personal
information
■Connections: Used to set up the Internet Connection settings for the browser
■Programs: Used to set up which programs Windows automatically uses for each
Internet service
■Advanced: Used to enable and disable operation settings of the browser
Caching, or storing, Internet files is a feature of the web browser that is used to speed the
process of accessing previously visited websites. The file-storing tool in IE downloads
copies of the images or the HTML files of sites you have visited to the hard disk. When
you revisit the website, the site opens more quickly because the files are in the local disk
cache and do not need to be downloaded again.
Cached files in the web browser can become outdated or can be very large. These IE set-
tings allow you to control the size of the cache and indicate when the cache should be
refreshed:

■Every visit to the page
■Every time you start IE
■Automatically
■Never
To access the cache settings, click Settings in the Temporary Internet files section of the
Internet Options window shown previously in Figure 12-9.
Lab 12.2.5: Install an Alternate Browser (Optional)
In this lab, you will install the Mozilla Firefox web browser. Refer to the lab in IT
Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-
58713-198-6). You can perform this lab now or wait until the end of the chapter.
Describe Installation, Use, and Configuration of E-Mail
Software
E-mail software can be installed as part of a web browser or as a standalone application.
Outlook Express is an e-mail tool that is a component of the Microsoft Windows operating
system. To configure Outlook Express, you must provide information about your e-mail
account, as shown in Figure 12-10.
Figure 12-10 E-Mail Account Information
Chapter 12: Advanced Operating Systems
17
You should have the following information available when installing e-mail accounts into
the e-mail client software:
■Display name
■E-mail address
■Type of incoming mail server, such as POP3 or IMAP

■Incoming mail server name
■Outgoing mail server name
■Username
■Account password
The protocols used in e-mail include the following:
■Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3): Retrieves e-mails from a remote server over
TCP/IP. It does not leave a copy of the e-mail on the server; however, some implemen-
tations allow users to specify that mail be saved for some period of time.
■Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP): Allows local e-mail clients to retrieve e-
mail from a server. Typically leaves a copy of the e-mail on the server until you move
the e-mail to a personal folder in your e-mail application. IMAP synchronizes e-mail
folders between the server and client.
■Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): Transmits e-mails across a TCP/IP network.
It is the e-mail format for text that only uses ASCII encoding.
■Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME): Extends the e-mail format to
include text in ASCII standard, as well as other formats such as pictures and word
processor documents. Normally used in conjunction with SMTP.
Additional features are available with e-mail software:
■Automatic handling rules for e-mails
■Different e-mail coding, such as HTML, plain text, or rich text
■Newsgroups
Set Screen Resolution and Update Video Driver
After the operating system is installed, you can set the screen resolution to meet the require-
ments of your customer. If the screen resolution is not set properly, you can get unexpected
display results from different video cards and monitors. The unexpected results could
include a Windows desktop that does not take up the full area of the screen or a blank
screen if the resolution is set too high.
When using an LCD screen, the resolution should be set to native mode, or native resolu-
tion. Native mode is the screen resolution that is the same as the number of pixels that the
monitor has. If you change from the native mode, the monitor does not produce the best
picture. See Figure 12-11 for the screen resolution settings on a Windows XP Professional
computer.
18
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Figure 12-11 Display Properties
Chapter 12: Advanced Operating Systems
19
You can change the screen settings on the Settings tab of the Display Properties control
panel applet:
■Screen resolution: Determines the number of pixels. A higher number of pixels dis-
plays a better resolution and picture.
■Refresh rate: Determines how often the image on the screen is redrawn. Refresh rate is
expressed in hertz (Hz). The higher the refresh rate, the more steady the screen image.
■Display colors: Determines the number of colors visible on the screen at once. Colors
are created by varying the intensity of the three basic colors (red, green, and blue). The
more bits, the greater the number of colors. The following is a list of color depths:
■256 colors: 8-bit color
■65,536 colors: 16-bit color (High Color)
■16 million colors: 24-bit color (True Color)
■16 million colors: 24-bit color (True Color with 8-bit padding to allow 32-bit pro-
cessing)
When troubleshooting a display problem, check that the driver is fully compatible with the
graphics card. Windows might install a default driver that works, but might not provide all
the available options for best viewing and performance. See Figure 12-12 for the video driv-
er update utility in Windows XP Professional. 

Figure 12-12 Video Driver Update
20
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Perform the following steps for the best graphical performance:
Step 1.
Download the most recent driver from the manufacturer’s website.
Step 2.
Remove the current driver.
Step 3.
Disable antivirus software.
Step 4.
Install the new driver.
Step 5.
Restart the computer.
Note
Disabling the antivirus software leaves your computer vulnerable to viruses and should not be done if
you are connected to the Internet.
You might encounter problems when you install or reinstall a video driver. For example,
after performing the graphical performance steps, you are unable to view the screen when
you restart the computer. To investigate the problem and restore the settings, reboot the
computer. During the boot phase, press F8. Enter the boot options when prompted and
select Enable VGA Mode to use a 640 x 480 resolution. When the operating system is
loaded, you can then select Roll Back Driver from the Properties menu of the graphics
card. You should then do some research to determine the possible issues with the driver that
you tried to install. 
Describe Installation of a Second Operating System
You can have multiple operating systems on a single computer. Some software applications
might require the most recent version of an operating system, while other applications
How To

require an older version. There is a dual-boot process for multiple operating systems on a
computer. When the boot.ini file determines that more than one operating system is present
during the boot process, you are prompted to choose the operating system that you want to
load. Figure 12-13 shows a sample boot.ini file.
Figure 12-13 boot.ini File
Chapter 12: Advanced Operating Systems
21
To create a dual-boot system in Microsoft Windows, you typically must have more than one
hard drive or the hard drive must contain more than one partition.
For a dual-boot setup, you should install the oldest operating system on the primary parti-
tion or the hard drive marked as the active partition first. You should then install the second
operating system on the second partition or hard drive. The boot files are automatically
installed in the active partition.
During the installation, the boot.ini file is created on the active partition to allow the selec-
tion of the operating system to boot on startup. The boot.ini file can be edited to change the
order of the operating systems. You can also edit the file for the length of time an operating
system selection can be made during the boot phase. Typically, the default time to select an
operating system is 30 seconds. This always delays the boot time of the computer by 30
seconds, unless the user intervenes to select a particular operating system. In the boot.ini
file, the boot time should be changed to 5 or 10 seconds to boot up the computer faster.
To edit the boot.ini file, right-click My Computer and choose Properties > Advanced tab. In
the Startup and Recovery area, select Settings and then click Edit. 
Describe How to Upgrade Operating Systems
An operating system must be upgraded periodically to remain compatible with the latest
hardware and software. When newer versions of an operating system are released, support
for older operating systems is eventually withdrawn.

Hardware products are continually coming on the market. The new design of the products
often requires that the latest operating system be installed to operate correctly. While this
might be expensive, you gain advanced functionality through new features and support for
newer hardware.
A Windows XP upgrade can be performed from a CD or over a network. You should ensure
that the new operating system is compatible with the computer. Microsoft provides a utility
called the Upgrade Advisor, as shown in Figure 12-14, to scan the system for incompatibili-
ty issues before upgrading to newer Windows operating systems. You can download the
Upgrade Advisor from the Microsoft Windows website free of charge. After the Upgrade
Advisor is finished, a report is produced to inform you of any problems. Incompatibility in
hardware is the most common reason for failure in the upgrade process.
Figure 12-14 Windows Upgrade Advisor
22
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Not all older Windows operating systems are upgradeable to the newer versions, as
described in the following list:
■Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows Me can be upgraded to Windows XP
Home or Windows XP Professional.
■Windows NT workstation 4.0 with Service Pack 6 and Windows 2000 Professional can
be upgraded only to Windows XP Professional.
■Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 cannot be upgraded to Windows XP.
Note
Remember to back up all data prior to beginning the upgrade. 

Describe Preventive Maintenance Procedures
for Operating Systems
Preventive maintenance for an operating system includes automating tasks to perform
scheduled updates. It also includes installing service packs that help keep the system up to
date and compatible with new software and hardware.
If a driver or system becomes corrupted, you can use restore points to restore the system to
a previous state. However, restore points cannot recover lost data.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Schedule automatic tasks and updates
■Set restore points
Schedule Automatic Tasks and Updates
You can automate tasks in Windows XP using the Scheduled Tasks utility. The Scheduled
Tasks utility monitors selected, user-defined criteria and then executes the tasks when the
criteria have been met.
GUI Scheduled Tasks
Some of the common tasks that are automated using the Scheduled Tasks utility include the
following:
■Disk cleanup
■Backup
■Disk defragmenter
■Starting other applications
To open the Scheduled Tasks wizard, choose Start > All Programs > Accessories >
System Tools > Scheduled Tasks. Double-click Add Scheduled Task, as shown in Figure
12-15.
CLI Scheduled Tasks
The Scheduled Tasks utility is a Windows-based GUI utility. You can also use the at com-
mand in the command-line utility to automatically schedule a command, a script file, or an
application to run at a specific date and time. To use the at command, you must be logged
in as a member of the administrator group.
To learn more about the at command, choose Start > Run. At the CLI prompt, type cmd
and then press Enter. At the command prompt, type at/?.

Windows Automatic Updates
You should use one of the following methods to configure updates for the Windows XP
operating system:
■Automatic (need to specify a date and time)
■Download updates for me, but let me choose when to install them
■Notify me but don’t automatically download or install them
■Turn off Automatic Updates
You can access the Automatic Updates screen, shown in Figure 12-16, from the Control
Panel.
Lab 12.4.1: Schedule Task Using GUI and the at Command
In this lab, you will schedule a task using the Windows XP GUI and schedule a task in a
command window using the at command. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC Hardware
and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can per-
form this lab now or wait until the end of the chapter. 

Figure 12-16 Automatic Updates
Chapter 12: Advanced Operating Systems
25
Set Restore Points
Restore points return the operating system to a predefined point in time. In some cases, the
installation of an application or a hardware driver can cause instability or create unexpected
changes to the computer. Uninstalling the application or hardware driver normally corrects
the problem. If uninstalling does not solve the problem, you should try to restore the com-
puter to an earlier time when the system worked properly.
To open the System Restore utility, as shown in Figure 12-17, choose Start > All
Programs > Accessories > System Tools > System Restore.
Windows XP can create restore points in the following scenarios:
■When an install or upgrade takes place
■Every 24 hours, if the computer is running
■Manually, at any time
The restore points contain information about the system and registry settings that are used
by Windows operating systems. System Restore does not back up personal data files nor
recover personal files that have been corrupted or deleted. To back up data, you should use
a dedicated backup system, such as a tape drive, CDs, or even a USB storage device.

Troubleshoot Operating Systems
The troubleshooting process helps resolve problems with the operating system. These prob-
lems range from simple, such as a driver that does not operate properly, to complex, such as
a system that locks up. Use the following troubleshooting steps as a guideline to help you
diagnose and repair problems:
Step 1.
Gather data from the customer.
Step 2.
Verify the obvious issues.
Step 3.
Try quick solutions first.
Step 4.
Gather data from the computer.
Step 5.
Evaluate the problem and implement the solution.
Step 6.
Close with the customer.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Review the troubleshooting process
■Identify common problems and solutions
■Apply troubleshooting skills
How To

Review the Troubleshooting Process
Computer technicians must be able to analyze the problem and determine the cause of the
error to repair the computer. This process is called troubleshooting. 
Step 1: Gather Data from the Customer
The first step in the troubleshooting process is to gather data from the customer. Table 12-3
provides a list of open-ended and closed-ended questions to ask the customer about operat-
ing system errors. (This list is not comprehensive.)
Table 12-3

computer?
Does the system look different?
Have you received any error messages on your
computer?
Step 2: Verify the Obvious Issues
After you have talked to the customer, you should verify the obvious issues that apply to the
operating system:
■Do you have the current service pack installed?
■Do you have the current drivers installed?
■Do you run a virus spyware scanner?
■Have you changed any system defaults?
■Have you noticed problems with the screen resolution?
■Have you noticed problems when running certain applications?
■Has any software been added or upgraded?
■Has any hardware been added or removed?
■Have any cables been added or disconnected?
Chapter 12: Advanced Operating Systems
27

Step 3: Try Quick Solutions First
After the obvious issues have been verified, try some quick solutions to operating system
problems:
■Reboot the computer (warm boot)
■Turn the computer off and then on (cold boot)
■Driver roll back
■System restore
■Last known good configuration
■Virus scan
■Spyware scan
Step 4: Gather Data from the Computer
If quick solutions did not correct the problem, it is time to gather data from the computer,
including information about or from the following:
■System files
■Event logs
■Device Manager
■Configuration files
■Restore points
■Diagnostic software
Step 5: Evaluate the Problem and Implement the Solution
At this point, you will have enough information to evaluate the problem and research and
implement possible solutions. Some examples of resources for possible solutions include
■Problem-solving experience
■Other technicians
■Internet search
■Newsgroups
■Manufacturer FAQs
■Computer manuals
■Device manuals
28
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Online forums
■Technical websites
Step 6: Close with the Customer
After you have solved the problem, you will close with the customer, which requires com-
pleting the following tasks:
Step 1.
Discuss the solution implemented with customer.
Step 2.
Have the customer verify that the problem has been solved.
Step 3.
Provide the customer with all paperwork.
Step 4.
Document the steps taken to solve the problem in the work order and the techni-
cian’s journal.
Step 5.
Document any components used in the repair. 
Step 6.
Document the time spent to resolve the problem.
Identify Common Problems and Solutions
Computer problems can be attributed to hardware, software, networks, or some combination
of the three. You will resolve some types of computer problems more often than others. A
stop error is a hardware or software malfunction that causes the system to lock up. This
type of error is known as the blue screen of death (BSoD) and appears when the system is
unable to recover from an error. The BSoD is usually caused by device driver errors. The
Event Log and other diagnostic utilities are available to research a stop error or BSoD error.
To prevent these types of errors, verify that the hardware and software drivers are compati-
ble. In addition, install the latest patches and updates for Windows. When the system locks
up during startup, the computer can automatically reboot. The reboot is caused by the auto-
restart function in Windows and makes it difficult to see the error message. The auto-restart
function can be disabled in the Advanced Startup Options menu. Table 12-4 is a chart of
common operating system problems and solutions.

With the increase in demand for mobility, the popularity of laptops and portable devices
will continue to grow. During the course of your career, you will be expected to know how
to configure, repair, and maintain these devices. The knowledge you acquire about desktop
computers will help you service laptops and portable devices. However, there are important
differences between the two technologies.
To facilitate mobility, laptops and portable devices use wireless technologies more than
desktops. All laptops use batteries when they are disconnected from a power source.
Docking stations are commonly used to connect a laptop to peripheral devices. As a com-
puter technician, you will be required to configure, optimize, and troubleshoot these dock-
ing stations and accessories, as well as the laptop or portable device that they accompany.
Many laptop components are proprietary, so some manufacturers require that you complete
specialized certification training to perform laptop repairs.
Servicing laptops can be very challenging. Mastering the skills necessary to work on lap-
tops is important to your career advancement.
Describe Wireless Communication Methods for
Laptops and Portable Devices
Wireless devices give people the freedom to work, learn, play, and communicate wherever
they want. People using wireless-capable devices do not need to be tied to a physical loca-
tion to send and receive voice, video, and data communications. As a result, wireless facili-
ties, such as Internet cafes, are opening in many countries. College campuses use wireless
networks to allow students to sign up for classes, watch lectures, and submit assignments in
areas where physical connections to the network are unavailable. This trend toward wireless
communications will continue to grow as more people use wireless devices.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe Bluetooth technology.
■Describe infrared technology.
■Describe cellular WAN technology.
■Describe Wi-Fi technology.
■Describe satellite technology.
Describe Bluetooth Technology
Bluetooth is a wireless technology that enables devices to communicate over short dis-
tances. A Bluetooth device can connect up to seven other Bluetooth devices to create a
wireless personal-area network (WPAN). This technical specification is described by the
2
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.1 standard. Bluetooth
devices can handle voice and data and are ideally suited for connecting the following
devices:
■Laptops
■Printers
■Cameras
■PDAs
■Cell phones
■Hands-free headsets
Common Bluetooth characteristics include the following:
■Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology designed to eliminate the need for
cables between portable and fixed-configuration devices.
■It operates at 2.4 to 2.485 GHz in the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical
(ISM) band.
■It uses little power and has a low cost and a small size.
■It uses adaptive frequency hopping (AFH).
The distance of a Bluetooth personal-area network (PAN) is limited by the amount of power
used by the devices in the PAN. Bluetooth devices are broken into three classifications, as
shown in Table 13-1. The most common Bluetooth network is Class 2, which has a range of
approximately 33 feet (10 m).
Table 13-1
Bluetooth Classifications
Class
Maximum Permitted Power (in mW)
Approximate Distance
Class 1
100 mW
~330 feet (100 m)
Class 2
2.5 mW
~33 feet (10 m)
Class 3
1 mW
~3 feet (1 m)
Bluetooth devices operate in the 2.4- to 2.485-GHz radio frequency range, which is in the
ISM band. This band often does not require a license if approved equipment is used. The
Bluetooth standard incorporates AFH. AFH allows signals to “hop around” using different
frequencies within the Bluetooth range, thereby reducing the chance of interference when
multiple Bluetooth devices are present. AFH also allows the device to learn frequencies that
are already in use and to choose a different subset of frequencies.
Chapter 13: Advanced Laptops and Portable Devices

Security measures are included in the Bluetooth standard. The first time that a Bluetooth
device connects, the device is authenticated using a personal identification number (PIN).
Bluetooth supports both 128-bit encryption and PIN authentication.
Describe Infrared Technology
Infrared (IR) wireless technology is a low-power, short-range wireless technology. IR
transmits data using Light-Emitting Diodes (LED) and receives data using photodiodes.
IR wireless networks are globally unregulated. However, the Infrared Data Association
(IrDA) defines the specifications for IR wireless communication. Common IR characteris-
tics include the following:
■IR wireless technology is low-power, short-range, wireless technology that uses LEDs.
■Infrared light signals operate in the lowest light frequency, and transmission distances
are limited to a few feet or meters.
■Infrared light cannot penetrate ceilings or walls.
Four types of IR networks exist:
■Line of sight: The signal is transmitted only if there is a clear, unobstructed view
between devices.
■Scatter: The signal bounces off ceilings and walls.
■Reflective: The signal is sent to an optical transceiver and is redirected to the receiving
device.
■Broadband optical telepoint: Transmission can handle high-quality multimedia
requirements.
Infrared networks are ideal for connecting laptops to the following types of devices that are
in close proximity:
■Multimedia projector
■PDA
■Printer
■Remote control
■Wireless mouse
■Wireless keyboard
Setting up and configuring IR devices is quite simple. Many IR devices connect to the USB
port on a laptop or desktop computer. As soon as the computer detects the new device,
Windows XP installs the appropriate drivers, as shown in Figure 13-1.
4
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Figure 13-1
Installing an Infrared Driver
Chapter 13: Advanced Laptops and Portable Devices

The installation is similar to setting up a LAN connection.
IR is a practical, short-range connection solution, but it has some limitations:
■IR light cannot penetrate ceilings or walls.
■IR signals are susceptible to interference and dilution by strong light sources, such as
florescent lighting.
■Scatter IR devices can connect without line of sight, but data transfer rates are lower,
and distances are shorter.
■IR distances should be 3 feet (1 m) or less when used for computer communications. 
Describe Cellular WAN Technology
Originally, cellular networks were designed for voice communication only. Cellular technol-
ogy has been evolving and now enables the transfer of voice, video, and data simultaneous-
ly. It also enables the use of laptops and portable devices remotely. With a cellular WAN
adapter installed, a laptop user can travel and access the Internet. Common cellular WAN
characteristics include the following:
■Cellular WAN connections are powerful two-way wireless networks that have been
around since the late 1970s.
■Cellular networks operate in one of two ranges: approximately 800 MHz and approxi-
mately 1900 MHz.
■Three generations of cellular WAN include voice-only analog, digital, and high-speed
data and voice.
Although they are slower than DSL and cable connections, cellular WANs are still fast
enough to be classified as a high-speed connection. To connect a laptop to a cellular WAN,

you should install an adapter that is designed to work with cellular networks. A cellular
adapter needs to support some or all of the following:
■Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM): Worldwide cellular network.
■General Packet Radio Service (GPRS): Data service for users of GSM.
■Quad-band: Allows a cellular phone to operate on all four GSM frequencies: 850
MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz.
■Short Message Service (SMS): Text messages.
■Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS): Multimedia messages.
■Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE): Provides increased data rates
and improved data reliability.
■Evolution Data Optimized (EV-DO): Faster download rates.
Connecting to a cellular WAN is a simple process. Cellular WAN cards, as shown in Figure
13-2, are “plug and play.” These cards plug in to the PC Card slot or are built in to the
laptop. 
Figure 13-2

Describe Wi-Fi Technology
The wireless technology Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) is based on IEEE 802.11 networking
standards and specifications. The number 802.11 denotes a set of standards that are speci-
fied in the IEEE 802.11 documentation. Hence, the terms 802.11 and Wi-Fi are inter-
changeable. Here are some characteristics of Wi-Fi:

■Wi-Fi is a wireless technology that provides a simple connection from anywhere within
range of a base station.
■Connection distances are 300 feet (91 m) or more, depending on the environment.
■Ease of access makes Wi-Fi a simple solution for network connectivity.
Currently, four major Wi-Fi 802.11 standards exist:
■802.11a
■802.11b
■802.11g
■802.11n (draft standard)
Technicians often refer to Wi-Fi standards by just the final letter. For example, a technician
may refer to an 802.11b wireless router as simply a “b” router.
The 802.11g standard was released in 2003 and currently is the most common Wi-Fi stan-
dard. The 802.11n standard was released in draft form in 2006 and may be modified slight-
ly before becoming an official IEEE standard. 
The 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n standards use the 2.4-GHz frequency band. The 2.4-
GHz frequency band is unregulated and heavily used. The large amount of traffic can cause
wireless signals in the 2.4-GHz range to be interfered with by other 2.4-GHz wireless
devices, such as cordless phones. For this reason, the 802.11a standard was designed to use
the 5.0-GHz frequency band. As a result, 802.11a is incompatible with other 802.11x stan-
dards. Table 13-2 provides data rate and range information for the four major Wi-Fi stan-
dards.
Table 13-2

Security is a major concern for wireless networks. Anyone within the coverage area of a
wireless router can potentially gain access to the network. The following precautions should
be taken for security purposes:
■Never send login or password information using clear, unencrypted text.
■Use a VPN connection when possible.
Chapter 13: Advanced Laptops and Portable Devices
7

■Enable security on home networks.
■Use Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) security.
Wi-Fi Protected Access standards (WPA, WPA2) are used to secure Wi-Fi networks. WPA
uses a sophisticated encryption and authentication technology to protect data flow between
Wi-Fi devices. WPA uses a 128-bit encryption key and should be enabled on all wireless
devices. WPA was introduced to replace wired equivalent privacy (WEP), which had known
security issues.
Describe Satellite Technology
Satellite technology service is ideal for rural or remote users who require high-speed broad-
band access in areas where no other high-speed services are available. However, because of
the higher initial cost and relatively slower speeds, high-speed satellite network connections
are recommended only if a cable or Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) connection is unavail-
able. Common satellite characteristics include the following:
■Satellite networks are faster than dialup connections but are slower than cable and DSL
connections.
■Satellite service is ideal for the rural or remote Internet users.
■Downloading files is faster than uploading files.
■Adverse weather conditions can interfere with satellite reception.
Satellite Internet connections use two-way data channels. One channel is used for uploading
and another for downloading. Both download and upload can be accomplished using a
satellite connection. In some cases, a telephone line and modem are used for the upload.
Download speeds typically are in the 500-kbps range, and uploads are about 50 kbps, mak-
ing this an asymmetrical connection similar to DSL. Satellite connections are slower than
cable or DSL connections but are faster than telephone modem connections. Some advan-
tages of connecting by satellite are as follows:
■Two-way, high-speed Internet access, available in rural and remote areas
■Quick file downloads
■Satellite dish may also be used for TV access
Proper placement, installation, and configuration of a satellite system are important for the
system to work effectively. Even if you point the satellite dish toward the equator, where
most satellites orbit the Earth, obstructions and adverse weather can still interfere with sig-
nal reception.
8
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Specific equipment is needed to set up a satellite connection:
■24-inch (610-mm) satellite dish
■Modem for uplink and downlink
■Coaxial cable and connectors
Describe Repairs for Laptops and Portable
Devices
When a laptop or portable device begins to malfunction, what should you do? The customer
can replace some parts of a laptop, typically called Customer-Replaceable Units (CRU).
CRUs include such components as the laptop battery and additional RAM. Parts that the
customer should not replace are called Field-Replaceable Units (FRU). FRUs include such
components as the laptop motherboard, LCD display, and keyboard. In many cases, the
device may need to be returned to the place of purchase, a certified service center, or even
the manufacturer.
Figure 13-3 shows an example of a CRU and FRU.
Figure 13-3
Repair Methods for Laptops and Portable Devices
Chapter 13: Advanced Laptops and Portable Devices
9
A repair center can provide service on laptops made by different manufacturers, or a repair
center may specialize in a specific brand and be considered an authorized dealer for warran-
ty work and repair. The following are common repairs performed at local repair centers:
■Hardware and software diagnostics
■Data transfer and recovery
■Hard drive installation and upgrades

■RAM installation and upgrades
■Keyboard and fan replacement
■Internal laptop cleaning
■LCD screen repair
■LCD inverter and backlight repair
Most repairs to LCD displays must be performed in a repair center. These repairs include
replacing the LCD screen, the backlight that shines through the screen to illuminate the dis-
play, and the inverter that produces the high voltage required by the backlight. If the back-
light has failed, the screen is visible only when you look at it from an angle.
If no local services are available, you might be required to send the laptop to a regional
repair center or to the manufacturer. If the laptop damage is severe or requires specialized
software and tools, the manufacturer can decide to replace the laptop instead of attempting
a repair. 
Caution
Before attempting to repair a laptop or portable device, check the warranty to see if repairs during the
warranty period must be done at an authorized service center to avoid invalidating the warranty. If
you repair a laptop yourself, you should always back up the data and disconnect the device from the
power source.
Worksheet 13.2.0: Investigating Repair Centers
For this worksheet, you investigate the services provided by a computer repair center. Use
the Internet or a local phone directory to locate one. After you have found a repair center,
use its website to obtain information, and answer the questions in the worksheet. If a web-
site is not available, contact the local repair center. Refer to the worksheet in IT Essentials:
PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You may complete this
worksheet now or wait to do so until the end of the chapter.
Select Laptop Components
Laptop components need to be replaced for a variety of reasons:
■The original part might be worn, damaged, or faulty.
■You might want additional functionality, such as a wireless PC card that supports new
standards.
■You might want to improve performance by adding memory.
10
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

When implementing any of these changes, make sure that all new components are physical-
ly and electrically compatible with the existing components and operating system.
It is always a good idea to purchase components from a reputable source and research the
warranty information. Components generally fall into two categories:
■Retail-packaged: These components usually come with documentation, a full warran-
ty, cables, mounting hardware, drivers, and software.
■Original equipment manufacturer (OEM): OEM components are usually sold without
packaging and require the user to locate documentation, software, drivers, and any
additional hardware that might be needed. OEM components are usually less expensive
and offer a shorter warranty period than similar retail packaged components. Using
OEM components can result in substantial savings when upgrades are performed in
bulk on many laptops, and additional support is not needed.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Select batteries.
■Select a docking station or port replicator.
■Select storage devices.
■Select additional RAM.
Select Batteries
How do you know when you need a new laptop battery? The signs might not always be
apparent, but some are obvious:
■The laptop shuts off immediately when AC power is removed
■The battery is leaking
■The battery overheats
■The battery does not hold a charge
If you experience problems that you suspect are battery-related, exchange the battery with a
known good battery that is compatible with the laptop. If a replacement battery cannot be
located, take the battery to an authorized repair center for testing.
A replacement battery, as shown in Figure 13-4, must meet or exceed the specifications of
the laptop manufacturer. New batteries must use the same form factor as the original bat-
tery. Voltages, power ratings, and AC adapters must also meet manufacturer specifications.
Chapter 13: Advanced Laptops and Portable Devices

Figure 13-4
Laptop Batteries
12
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Note
Always follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer when charging a new battery. The lap-
top can be used during an initial charge, but do not unplug the AC adapter. Ni-Cad and NiMH
rechargeable batteries should occasionally be discharged completely to remove the charge memory.
When the battery is completely discharged, it should then be charged to maximum capacity.
Caution
Always be careful when handling batteries. Batteries can explode if improperly charged, shorted, or
mishandled. Be sure that the battery charger is designed for the chemistry, size, and voltage of your
battery. Batteries are considered toxic waste and must be disposed of according to local laws.
Worksheet 13.3.1: Laptop Batteries
In this activity, you use the Internet, a newspaper, or a local store to gather information and
then enter the specifications for a laptop battery onto this worksheet. Refer to the worksheet
in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You
may complete this worksheet now or wait to do so until the end of the chapter. 
Select a Docking Station or Port Replicator
Docking stations and port replicators increase the number of ports available to a laptop. A
port replicator may contain a SCSI port, a networking port, PS/2 ports, USB ports, and a
game port. A docking station has the same ports as a port replicator, but it adds the capabil-
ity to connect to PCI cards, additional hard drives, optical drives, and floppy drives.

Docking stations make it convenient to connect a laptop to an office network and peripherals.
A laptop connected to a docking station has the same capabilities as a desktop computer.
Figure 13-5 shows several docking stations and port replicators that support the same laptop.
Figure 13-5
Docking Stations and Port Replicators
Chapter 13: Advanced Laptops and Portable Devices
13
Docking stations and port replicators offer several connection options:
■Ethernet (RJ-45)
■Modem (RJ-11)
■S-Video, TV out
■USB 2.0 port
■External monitor
■Parallel port
■High-speed serial port
■IEEE 1394 port
■Stereo headphone output
■Stereo microphone input
■Docking port
Some docking stations connect to a laptop using a docking station port that is located on the
bottom of the laptop, as shown in Figure 13-6. Other docking stations are designed to plug
directly into a USB port of the laptop. Most laptops can be docked when in use or while
shut off. The addition of new devices when docking can be handled by using plug-and-play

technology that recognizes and configures the newly added components, or by having a sep-
arate hardware profile for the docked and undocked state.
Figure 13-6
Docking Station Connector
14
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Many docking stations and port replicators are proprietary and work only with particular
laptops. Before buying a docking station or port replicator, check the laptop documentation
or the manufacturer’s website to determine the laptop’s make and model.
Worksheet 13.3.2: Docking Station
In this activity, you use the Internet, a newspaper, or a local store to gather information and
then enter the specifications for a laptop docking station onto this worksheet. Be prepared
to discuss your decisions about the docking station you select. Refer to the worksheet in IT
Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You may
complete this worksheet now or wait to do so until the end of the chapter.
Select Storage Devices
Storage devices are CRUs, unless a warranty requires technical assistance. You have several
options when adding, replacing, or upgrading a storage device for a laptop:
■External USB hard drive: An external USB hard drive connects to a laptop using the
USB port. A laptop automatically detects when an external hard drive is plugged into a
USB port.
■Firewire hard drive: An IEEE 1394 external hard drive that connects to the Firewire
port. A laptop automatically detects when an external hard drive is plugged into a
Firewire port.

■DVD/CD burner: A DVD/CD RW drive is an optical drive that reads and writes data to
and from a CD and reads data from a DVD. This is a convenient method of creating
backups and archiving data. The two most common types of writable CDs and DVDs
are writable (R) and rewritable (RW).
The form factor of an internal hard drive storage device is smaller for a laptop than for a
desktop computer. However, the smaller drive may have a greater storage capacity.
Before purchasing a new internal or external hard drive, check the laptop documentation or
the manufacturer’s website for compatibility requirements. Documentation often contains
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) that may be helpful. It is also important to research
known laptop component issues on the Internet.
Worksheet 13.3.3: Research DVD Drives
In this activity, you use the Internet, a newspaper, or a local store to gather information
about a DVD rewritable (DVD/RW) drive for a specified laptop. Refer to the worksheet in
IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You may
complete this worksheet now or wait to do so until the end of the chapter. 
Select Additional RAM
Adding RAM can optimize laptop performance. Additional RAM speeds up the process by
decreasing the number of times the operating system reads and writes data to the hard drive
swap file. Reading and writing data directly from RAM is faster than using swap files. Also,
RAM helps the operating system run multiple applications more efficiently.
Graphic processing in laptops usually is performed by the CPU and often requires extra
RAM to store the video while the CPU decodes it for viewing. New applications, such as
video sharing and video editing, demand increased performance from laptops. Installing
expansion RAM can help increase laptop performance.
The laptop’s make and model determine the type of RAM chip needed. It is important to
select the correct memory type that is physically compatible with the laptop. Most desktop
computers use memory that fits into a Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM) slot. Most lap-
tops use a smaller profile memory chip that is called Small-Outline DIMM (SODIMM)
(see Figure 13-7). SODIMMs are smaller than DIMMs, so they are ideal for use in laptops,
printers, and other devices where conserving space is desirable. When replacing or adding
memory, determine whether the laptop has available slots to add memory and whether the
laptop supports the quantity and type of memory to be added.
Chapter 13: Advanced Laptops and Portable Devices
15

Figure 13-7
SODIMM RAM
16
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Before purchasing and installing additional RAM, consult the laptop documentation or the
manufacturer’s website for form-factor specifications. Use the documentation to find where
to install RAM on the laptop. On most laptops, RAM is inserted into slots behind a cover
on the underside of the case, as shown in Figure 13-8. However, on some laptops, you must
remove the keyboard to access the RAM slots.
Figure 13-8
Laptop SODIMM Installation
Caution
Before installing RAM, remove the battery and unplug the computer from the electrical outlet to
avoid damage related to electrostatic discharge (ESD) when you are installing memory modules.

To confirm the currently installed amount of RAM, check the POST screen, BIOS, or
System Properties window by choosing Start > Control Panel > System and then clicking
the General tab. Figure 13-9 shows where the amount of RAM can be found in the System
Properties window.

sheet now or wait to do so until the end of the chapter. 
Describe Preventive Maintenance Procedures
for Laptops
Preventive maintenance should be scheduled at regular intervals to keep laptops running
properly. Because laptops are portable, they are more likely than desktop computers to be
exposed to these harmful materials and situations:
■Dirt and contamination
■Spills
■Wear and tear
■Drops

■Excessive heat or cold
■Excessive moisture
In addition, properly managing data files and folders can ensure data integrity.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe how to schedule and perform maintenance on laptops.
■Explain how to manage data version control between desktops and laptops.
Describe How to Schedule and Perform Maintenance
on Laptops
Proper care and maintenance can help laptop components run more efficiently and extend
the life of the equipment.
An effective preventive maintenance program must include a routine schedule for mainte-
nance. Most organizations have a preventive maintenance schedule in place. If a schedule
does not exist, work with the manager to create one. The most effective preventive mainte-
nance programs require a set of routines to be conducted monthly but still allow mainte-
nance to be performed when usage demands it.
The preventive maintenance schedule for a laptop may include practices that are unique to a
particular organization, but they should also include these standard procedures:
■Cleaning
■Hard-drive maintenance
■Software updates
To keep a laptop clean, be proactive, not reactive. Keep fluids away from the laptop. Do not
eat when you are working on it, and close it when it is not in use. When cleaning a laptop,
never use harsh cleaners or solutions that contain ammonia. Nonabrasive materials are rec-
ommended for cleaning a laptop:
■Compressed air
■A mild cleaning solution
■Cotton swabs
■A soft, lint-free cleaning cloth
Caution
Before you clean a laptop, disconnect it from all power sources.
18
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Routine maintenance includes the monthly cleaning of these laptop components:
■Exterior case
■Cooling vents
■I/O ports
■Display
■Keyboard
Note
At any time, if it is obvious that the laptop needs to be cleaned, clean it. Do not wait for the next
scheduled maintenance.
The operating system should also be maintained. The hard drive can become disorganized
as files are opened, saved, and deleted. The computer can slow down if the operating sys-
tem must search through fragmented files. Fortunately, Windows XP has two programs that
help clean up the hard drive:
■Disk Cleanup
■Disk Defragmenter
To Run Disk Cleanup, follow these steps:
Step 1.
From My Computer, select the hard drive you want to clean.
Step 2.
Right-click and choose Properties.
Step 3.

Explain How to Manage Data Version Control Between
Desktops and Laptops
It is important to manage your data files and folders properly. Restore and recover proce-
dures, as well as backups, are more successful if the data is organized.
Windows XP has a default location, sometimes available as an icon on the desktop called
My Documents. You can use My Documents to create a folder structure and store files.
When moving files from a laptop to a desktop computer, start by creating a similar folder
structure in both locations. Files can be transferred over a network, with an optical disc, or
with a portable drive.
You should be careful that data copied from one computer does not inadvertently overwrite
data on the other computer. When you are copying a file to a destination folder, you might
encounter a “Confirm File Replace” message, as shown in Figure 13-12.

Figure 13-12 File Replacement Confirmation
Chapter 13: Advanced Laptops and Portable Devices
21
This message indicates that Windows XP has stopped the copying process until you choose
whether to replace the original file with the file that is being transferred. If you are unsure,
click No. To determine which file to keep, compare the dates and file sizes. You may also
open the files to view their content.
Note
No operating system allows files with the same name to exist in the same folder.
Caution
Be careful not to unintentionally “cut” a file from its original location when you only meant to
“copy” it.
Describe How to Troubleshoot a Laptop

Step 3: Try Quick Solutions First
After you have checked the obvious issues, try some quick solutions:
■Replace the AC power adapter with a known good AC power adapter.
■Remove and reinsert the battery.
■Replace the battery with a known good battery.
Step 4: Gather Data from the Computer
If quick solutions do not correct the problem, it is time to gather data from the computer.
Here are some different ways to gather information about the problem from the laptop:
■Error messages
■Beep sequences
■LEDs
■POST
Step 5: Evaluate the Problem and Implement the Solution
At this point, you have enough information to evaluate the problem and to research and
implement possible solutions. Here are some resources for possible solutions:
■Problem-solving experience
■Other technicians
■Internet search
■Newsgroups
■Manufacturer FAQs
■Computer manuals
■Device manuals
■Online forums
■Technical websites
Step 6: Close with the Customer
After you have solved the problem, you close with the customer, which requires completing
the following tasks:
Step 1.
Discuss the solution implemented with the customer.
Step 2.
Have the customer verify that the problem has been solved.
Chapter 13: Advanced Laptops and Portable Devices
23
How To

Step 3.
Provide the customer with all paperwork.
Step 4.
Document the steps taken to solve the problem in the work order and the techni-
cian’s journal.

Summary
This chapter has described components of laptops and portable devices. Here are some
important concepts contained in this chapter:
■Bluetooth creates a small wireless PAN for connected cell phones, printers, and lap-
tops.
■An IR network uses infrared light to create short-range networks that are primarily
used to control input devices and mobile devices.
■A cellular WAN allows you to use your cell phone and laptop for voice and data com-
munications.
■The most popular wireless technology is Wi-Fi. The four major Wi-Fi releases, each
with different speed and bandwidth ratings, are IEEE 802.11 a, b, g, and n.
■Satellite networks are faster than modems but slower than DSL and cable networks.
Satellite networks are primarily used in remote locations.
■A CRU is a component that a user can easily install without technical training.
■A FRU is a component that a trained service technician may install at a remote
location.
■Most repairs can be done at customers’ sites or at any local repair center. However, on
some occasions a laptop must be sent to the manufacturer for repairs.
■Professional technicians follow preventive maintenance schedules to keep their equip-
ment at optimal performance levels.
■Laptops are more susceptible to contamination and damage. A well-maintained laptop
reduces repair costs.
■A docking station allows a laptop to easily connect to peripheral devices similar to
those found on desktop computers. A port replicator can be added to a laptop if the
user needs more I/O ports.
■Mastering the steps in troubleshooting laptop problems is considered a career milestone
by many technicians.
■A well-trained technician must possess good customer communication skills.

This chapter explores the functionality of printers and scanners. You will learn how to main-
tain, install, and repair these devices in both local and network configurations. The chapter
discusses safety hazards, configuration procedures, preventive maintenance, and printer and
scanner sharing.
Describe Potential Safety Hazards and Safety
Procedures Associated with Printers and
Scanners
You must always follow safety procedures when working on any computer. There are also
rules that you must follow as you work with printers and scanners. These rules keep you
and the equipment safe.
The first rule of safety concerns moving large pieces of equipment. Always lift equipment
by using the strength in your legs and knees, not your back. Wear appropriate work clothes
and shoes. Do not wear loose jewelry or baggy clothes when servicing computer equip-
ment.
Printers, scanners, and all-in-one devices that connect to AC outlets can become hot while
in use. If you plan to perform any services on equipment, you should turn it off and allow it
to cool before beginning any repairs on internal components. Print heads on dot matrix
printers can become very hot when in use. The fuser assembly on a laser printer can also
become hot.
Some printers retain a large amount of voltage even after you disconnect them from a
power source. Only qualified technicians should perform advanced repairs on laser printers,
particularly if the repair involves the corona wire or transfer roller assembly, as shown in
Figure 14-1. These areas can retain high voltage, even after the printer has been turned off.
Check the service manuals or contact the manufacturer to be sure that you know where
these areas are inside the devices.
Printers and scanners can be expensive. If you do not service printers correctly, or if you
install the wrong part, you can damage them beyond repair.

Install and Configure a Local Printer and
Scanner
A local device is one that connects directly to the computer. Before you install a local
device, such as a printer or scanner, be sure that you remove all packing material. Take out
anything that prevents moving parts from shifting around during shipping. Keep the original
packing material in case you need to return the equipment to the manufacturer for warranty
repairs.
General printer and scanner installation is as follows:
Step 1.
Connect the device (USB, FireWire [IEEE 1394], LPT [IEEE 1284], Serial
[RS232], Printer Server).
Step 2.
Use Windows XP’s PnP driver.
Step 3.
Add software from the manufacturer.
Step 4.
Check for driver updates on the Internet.
Step 5.
Change default settings.
Step 6.
Make a test print.
Step 7.
Scan a picture.
Step 8.
Print the scanned picture.
How To

After completing this section, you will meet the following objectives:
■Connect the device to a local port
■Install and configure the driver and software
■Configure options and default settings
■Verify functionality
Connect the Device to a Local Port
Depending on the manufacturer, local printers can communicate with computers using seri-
al, parallel, USB, FireWire, or SCSI ports and cables. Wireless technologies, such as
Bluetooth and infrared, are also used to connect these devices. Review the characteristics of
these ports:
■Serial: Serial data transfer is the movement of single bits of information in a single
cycle. A serial connection can be used for dot matrix printers because the printers do
not require high-speed data transfer.
■Parallel: Parallel data transfer is faster than serial data transfer. Parallel data transfer is
the movement of multiple bits of information in a single cycle. The path is wider for
information to move to or from the printer. IEEE 1284 is the current standard for paral-
lel printer ports. Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) and Enhanced Capabilities Port (ECP)
are two modes of operation that allow bidirectional communication.
■SCSI: There are several types of SCSI, including the following common types:
■SCSI 1: 50-pin connector
■SCSI 2 (fast SCSI): 50-pin connector
■SCSI 2 (wide SCSI): 68-pin connector
■SCSI 3 (fast/wide SCSI): 68-pin connector
SCSI printers and computers require the proper cabling for the ports. These ports
can be DB 50, Mini DB 50, and DB 68. All of these ports can be male or female.
■USB: USB is a common interface for printers and other devices. The speed and simple
setup have made USB very practical. Newer operating systems offer Plug and Play
(PnP) USB support. When a USB device is added to a computer system supporting
PnP, the device is automatically detected, and the computer starts the driver installation
process.
■FireWire: FireWire, also known as i.LINK or IEEE 1394, is a high-speed communica-
tion bus that interconnects digital devices such as printers, scanners, cameras, and hard
drives, among others. FireWire provides a single plug-and-socket connection on which
up to 63 devices can be attached with data transfer speeds up to 400 Mbps.
4
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Ethernet: Printers can be shared over a network. Connecting a printer to the network
requires cabling that is compatible with both the existing network and the network port
installed in the printer. Most network printers use an RJ-45 interface to connect to a
network.
To connect a printer, attach the appropriate cable to the communication port on the back of
the printer. Connect the other end of the cable to the corresponding port on the back of the
computer.
After the data cable has been properly connected, attach the power cable to the printer.
Connect the other end of the power cable to an available electrical outlet. When you turn on
the power to the device, the computer tries to determine the correct device driver to install.
Tip
Always check the packaging for cables when you buy a printer or scanner. Many manufacturers keep
production costs down by not including a cable with the printer. If you have to buy a cable, be sure
that you buy the correct type. 
Install and Configure the Driver and Software
Printer drivers are software programs that make it possible for computers and printers to
communicate with each other. Configuration software provides an interface that enables
users to set and change printer options. Every printer model has its own type of driver and
configuration software.
When you connect a new printer device to a computer, Windows XP tries to locate and
install a default driver by using the PnP utility. If Windows cannot find the necessary driver
on the computer, it tries to connect to the Internet to find one. Printer manufacturers fre-
quently update drivers to increase the performance of the printer, to add new and improved
printer options, and to address general compatibility issues.
Printer Driver Installation
The printer driver installation and updating process usually involves the following five
steps:
Step 1.
Determine the current version of the installed printer driver. Remember to select
a newer version to increase functionality.
Step 2.
Search the Internet to locate the most recent version of the driver.
Step 3.
Download the driver. Follow the instructions on the website.
Step 4.
Install the driver. When activated, most driver installation programs automatical-
ly install the new driver.
Chapter 14: Advanced Printers and Scanners
5
How To

Step 5.
Test the driver. To test the driver, choose Start > Settings > Printers and Faxes.
Right-click the printer and choose Properties. Then choose Print Test Page. If
the printer does not work, restart the computer and then try again.
The printed test page should contain text that you can read. If the text is unreadable, the
problem could be a bad driver or that the wrong Page Description Language has been used.
Page Description Language (PDL)
A Page Description Language (PDL) is a type of code that describes the appearance of a
document in a language that a printer can understand. The PDL for a page includes the text,
graphics, and formatting information. Software applications use PDLs to send What You
See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) images to the printer. The printer translates the PDL file
so that whatever is on the computer screen is what is printed. PDLs speed the printing
process by sending large amounts of data at one time. PDLs also manage the computer
fonts.
There are three common PDLs:
■Printer Command Language (PCL): Hewlett-Packard developed PCL for communica-
tion with early inkjet printers. PCL is now an industry standard for nearly all printer
types.
■PostScript (PS): Adobe Systems developed PS to allow fonts or text types to share the
same characteristics on the screen as on paper.
■Graphics Device Interface (GDI): GDI is a Windows component that manages how
graphical images are transmitted to output devices. GDI works by converting images to
a bitmap that uses the computer instead of the printer to transfer the images.
Table 14-1 compares PostScript to PCL.

Configure Options and Default Settings
Common printer options that can be configured by the user include media control and print-
er output.
The following media control options set the way a printer manages media:
■Input paper tray selection
■Output path selection
■Media size and orientation
■Paper weight selection
The following printer output options manage how the ink or toner goes on the media:
■Color management
■Print speed
Some printers have control switches for users to select options. Other printers use the print-
er driver options. Two methods of selecting options are the global and per-document meth-
ods, as described in the sections that follow.
Global Printer Options
The global method refers to printer options that are set to affect all documents. Each time a
document is printed, the global options are used, unless overridden by per-document selec-
tions.
To change the configuration of a global printer, choose Start > Control Panel > Printers
and Faxes and right-click the printer. The following examples show how you can manage
printer options.
To designate a default printer, choose Start > Control Panel > Printers and Faxes. Right-
click the printer, and then choose Set as Default Printer, as shown in Figure 14-2.
Note
Depending on the driver installed, Set as Default Printer might not appear on the menu. If this hap-
pens, double-click the printer to open the Document Status window and then choose Printer > Set as
Default Printer.
To limit printing to only black and white, choose Start > Control Panel > Printer and
Faxes. Right-click the printer, and then choose Printing Preferences. Choose the Color
tab. Select the Print In Grayscale check box and choose the Black Print Cartridge Only
radio button in the window shown in Figure 14-3. Click OK.

Scanner Calibrations
Calibrating a device is one of the first tasks after installing a driver. Use the bundled soft-
ware that came with the device to perform this procedure. The default settings can be
altered later to meet customer requirements.
Scanner calibrations can include positioning the sensor and using an IT8 target to adjust
the color. An IT8 target is a color calibration chart that you use to create profiles for specific
devices. A scanner analyzes the target for comparison, while a printer reproduces the target
for comparison.
To ensure calibration, compare the printed output of the device to the IT8 target. Adjust the
printer color settings to match. The next time you print or scan an image, the color will be
as accurate as the target.
Printer Calibrations
The calibration of the printer is performed using the print driver software. This process
makes sure that the print heads are aligned and can print on special paper. Inkjet print heads
are usually fitted to the ink cartridge, which means that you might have to recalibrate the
printer each time you change a cartridge. 
Verify Functionality
The installation of any device is not complete until you have successfully tested all the
device functions. This includes special tasks such as the following:

■Printing double-sided documents to save paper
■Using different types of paper trays for special paper sizes
■Changing the settings of a color printer so that it prints in black and white or grayscale
to print draft copies of documents
■Printing in draft mode to save ink
■Changing a scanner’s resolution to make an image easier to view
■Editing scanned images of saved documents
■Using an optical character recognition (OCR) application
Note
Electronic manuals and support websites explain how to clear paper jams, install ink cartridges, and
load all types of paper trays.
Printer Test
There are several ways to print a test page:
■Using the Print Test Page option from the printer
■Using the Print Test Page option from Windows, as shown in Figure 14-5
■Using the print function of an application
■Sending a file directly to a parallel port printer using the command line
Figure 14-5
Print Test Page
10
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

To test a printer, first print a test page from the printer and then print from the printer prop-
erties function or from an application. To get to the printers properties, choose Start >
Printer and Faxes > (select your printer) > Print > Properties > Print Test Page. This
ensures that the printer is working properly, that the driver software is installed and work-
ing, and that the printer and computer are communicating.
Scanner Test
Test the scanner by scanning a document. Use the buttons on the device for automatic scan-
ning. Next, initiate scans from the scanner software and make sure that the software opens
automatic scan. If the scanned images appear to be the same as the image on the screen,
you have successfully completed the installation.
For an all-in-one device, you should test all the functions:
■Fax: Fax to another known working fax machine
■Copy: Create a copy of a document
■Scan: Scan a document
■Print: Print a document
Lab 14.2.4: Install an All-in-One Printer/Scanner
In this lab, you will check the Windows XP Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for the
Epson Stylus CX7800, install the all-in-one printer/scanner, upgrade the driver and any
associated software, and test the printer and scanner. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC
Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You
can perform this lab now or wait until the end of the chapter. 
Describe How to Share a Printer and a Scanner
on a Network
One of the primary reasons that networks were developed was to allow groups of computer
users to share peripheral devices. The most common shared device is the printer. Sharing a
single printer among a group of users costs much less than buying a printer for each com-
puter.
Low-cost printers usually require a separate print server to allow network connectivity
because these printers do not have built-in network interfaces. The computer that is con-
nected to the printer can serve as the print server. Most personal computer operating sys-
tems have built-in printer sharing capability.
Chapter 14: Advanced Printers and Scanners
11

After you confirm that the printer-sharing software is installed, the server must know which
printer it is going to share. From the Control Panel, select Printers and Faxes, right-click
the printer to share, and select Sharing from the resulting drop-down menu. Select the
Share this printer option, as shown in Figure 14-6, and assign the printer a name.

After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe the types of print servers
■Describe how to install network printer software and drivers on a computer
Describe the Types of Print Servers
Print servers enable multiple computer users to access a single printer. A print server has
three functions:
■To provide client access to print resources
■To administrate print jobs, storing them in a queue until the print device is ready for
them, and then feeding or spooling the print information to the printer
■To provide feedback to the users, including providing notification that a print job is fin-
ished, or error messages that something has gone wrong
As a technician, you must choose one of the three types of print server that best suits the
customer’s needs:
■Network print server devices
■Dedicated PC print servers
■Computer-shared printers

Network Print Server Devices
Network print server devices allow many users on a network to access a single printer. A
network print server device can manage network printing through either wired or wireless
connections. Figure 14-7 shows a wired print server. You should consider the advantages
and disadvantages of a dedicated PC print server before you install one:
■An advantage of using a network print server is that the server accepts incoming print
jobs from computers, and then frees the computers for other tasks. The print server is
always available to the users, unlike a printer shared from a user’s computer.
■A disadvantage of a network print server is that it might not be able to use all the func-
tions of an all-in-one device.
Figure 14-7
Network Print Server Device
Chapter 14: Advanced Printers and Scanners
13
Dedicated PC Print Servers
A dedicated PC print server is a computer dedicated to handling client print jobs in the
most efficient manner. Because it handles requests from multiple clients, a print server is
usually one of the most powerful computers on the network. Dedicated PC print servers can
manage more than one printer at a time. A print server needs to have resources available to
meet the requests of print clients:
■Powerful processor: Because the PC print server uses its processor to manage and
route printing information, it needs to be fast enough to handle all incoming requests.
■Adequate hard disk space: A PC print server captures print jobs from clients, places
them in a print queue, and sends them to the printer in a timely way. This requires the
computer to have enough storage space to hold these jobs until completed.
■Adequate memory: The server processor and RAM handle sending print jobs to a
printer. If server memory is not large enough to handle an entire print job, the hard
drive must send the job, which is much slower.

Computer-Shared Printers
A user’s computer that has a printer attached can share that printer with other users on the
network. Windows XP makes the process of enabling shared printers fast and easy. In a
home network, it means that users can print documents from wherever they are in the house
by using a wireless laptop. In a small office network, sharing a printer means one printer
can serve many users. 
Sharing a printer from a computer also has disadvantages. The computer sharing the printer
uses its own resources to manage the print jobs coming to the printer. If a user on the desk-
top is working at the same time that a user on the network is printing, the desktop user
might notice a performance slowdown. In addition, the printer is not available if the user
reboots or powers down the computer with a shared printer.
Describe How to Install Network Printer Software and
Drivers on a Computer
Windows XP allows computer users to share their printers with other users on the network.
There are two steps:
Step 1.
Configure the computer attached to the printer to share the printer with other net-
work users.
Step 2.
Configure a user’s computer to recognize the shared printer and print to it.
To configure the computer with the printer attached to accept print jobs from other network
users, follow these steps:
Step 1.
Choose Start > Control Panel > Printers and Other Hardware > Printers
and Faxes.
Step 2.
Select the printer you want to share.
Step 3.
The Printer Tasks dialog box will appear on the left. Select Share this printer.
Step 4.
The Printer Properties dialog box for that printer will display. Select the Sharing
tab. Select Share this printer and enter the desired share name. This is the name
that the printer will appear as to other users.
Step 5.
Verify that sharing has been successful. Return to the Printers and Faxes folder
and notice that the printer icon now has a hand under it, as shown in Figure 14-8.
This shows that the printer is now a shared resource.

Other users who can now connect to the shared printer might not have the required drivers
installed. These other users might also be using different operating systems than the com-
puter that is hosting the shared printer. Windows XP can automatically upload the correct
drivers to these other users. Click the Additional Drivers button to select operating systems
that the other users might be using. When you close that dialog box by clicking OK,
Windows XP will ask whether you want to obtain those additional drivers. If all the other
users are also operating Windows XP, you do not need to click the Additional Drivers but-
ton. To find the additional drivers button, choose Start>Printers and Faxes, right-click the
printer you are sharing, and choose Properties>Sharing>Additional Drivers button.
Other users on the network can now connect to this printer by following these steps:
Step 1.
Choose Start > Control Panel > Printers and other Hardware > Add a
Printer.
Step 2.
The Add Printer Wizard appears. Click Next.
Step 3.
Select A network printer, or a printer attached to another computer, as
shown in Figure 14-9. Click Next.
Step 4.
Type in the name of the printer, or browse for it on the network using the Next
button. A list of shared printers will appear.
Step 5.
After you select the printer, a virtual printer port is created and displayed in the
Add a Printer window. The required print drivers are downloaded from the print
server and installed on the computer. The wizard then finishes the installation.

You can perform this lab now or wait until the end of the chapter. 
Upgrade and Configure Printers and Scanners
Some printers can be expanded to print faster and to accommodate more print jobs by
adding hardware. The hardware can include additional paper trays, sheet feeders, network
cards, and expansion memory.
Scanners can also be configured to do more to meet customer needs. Examples for scanner
optimization include color correction and resizing. These tasks cannot be completed with
the default settings.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe printer upgrades
■Describe scanner optimization
Describe Printer Upgrades
Upgrading the printer memory improves the printing speed and enhances the ability to per-
form complex print jobs. All printers today have at least a small amount of RAM. The more

memory a printer has, the more efficiently it works. The added memory helps with tasks
such as job buffering, page creation, improved photo printing, and graphics.
Print job buffering is when a print job is captured into the internal printer memory.
Buffering allows the computer to continue with other work instead of waiting for the printer
to finish. Buffering is a common feature in laser printers and plotters, as well as in
advanced inkjet and dot matrix printers.
Printers usually arrive from the factory with enough memory to handle jobs that involve
text. However, print jobs involving graphics, and especially photographs, run more efficient-
ly if the printer memory is adequate to store the entire job before it starts. If you receive
errors that indicate the printer is “out of memory” or that there has been a “memory over-
load,” you might need more memory.
Installing Printer Memory
The first step in installing additional printer memory is to read the printer manual to deter-
mine the following:
■Memory type: Physical type of memory, speed, and capacity; some are standard types
of memory, whereas others require special or proprietary memory.
■Memory population and availability: Number of memory upgrade slots in use, and
how many are available; this can require opening a compartment to check RAM.
Printer manufacturers have set procedures for upgrading memory, including the following
tasks:
■Removing covers to access the memory area
■Installing or removing memory
■Initializing the printer to recognize the new memory
■Installing updated drivers if needed
Additional Printer Upgrades
Some additional printer upgrades include the following:
■Duplex printing to enable dual-sided printing
■Extra trays to hold more paper
■Specialized tray types for different media
■Network cards to access a wired or wireless network
■Firmware upgrades to add functionality or to fix bugs
Follow the instructions included with the printer when you install or upgrade components.
Contact the manufacturer or an authorized service technician for additional information if
Chapter 14: Advanced Printers and Scanners
17

you have any problems when installing upgrades. Follow all safety procedures outlined by
the manufacturer. 
Describe Scanner Optimization
Scanners work well for most users without any changes to the default settings. There are,
however, features that can improve document or image scans depending on user require-
ments. The most common types of scanner options are as follows:
■Resizing
■Sharpening
■Brightening or darkening
■Color correction
■Resolution changes
■Output file format
■Color inversion
Scanning resolution affects the size of the output file. The end use of the image determines
the required resolution. If the image is for use on a web publication, you only need low res-
olution and a small file size. This makes it possible for browsers to load the image quickly.
Medium-resolution images are normally used for laser prints. In commercial printing,
where the quality of the image is very important, a higher resolution is the best setting. Low
resolution means a small file size; high resolution means a large file size. Figure 14-10
shows the settings for resolution and output type.
Figure 14-10 Resolution Settings
18
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Scanners can allow you to choose different file formats for the scanned output, as shown in
Figure 14-11.
Figure 14-11 Output Options
Chapter 14: Advanced Printers and Scanners
19
If a scanner does not produce output in a file format required by the customer, the format
can be converted later using software tools. After changing device settings, you should test
the changes by making some sample printouts.
Lab 14.4.2: Optimize Scanner Output
In this lab, you will scan a picture at two different levels of dots per inch (DPI). The results
will be displayed and compared on your monitor as two saved files and as two printed
images. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study
Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can perform this lab now or wait until the
end of the chapter. 
Describe Printer and Scanner Preventive
Maintenance Techniques
Preventive maintenance decreases downtime and increases the service life of the compo-
nents. You should maintain printers and scanners to keep them working properly. A good
maintenance program guarantees good-quality prints and scans. The printer or scanner man-
ual contains information on how to maintain and clean the equipment.

After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Determine scheduled maintenance according to vendor guidelines
■Describe a suitable environment for printers and scanners
■Describe cleaning methods
■Describe how to check the capacity of ink cartridges and toners
Determine Scheduled Maintenance According to
Vendor Guidelines
Read the information manuals that come with every new piece of equipment. Follow the
recommended maintenance instructions. Also, use the supplies listed by the manufacturer.
Less expensive supplies can save money but might produce poor results, damage the equip-
ment, or void the warranty.
When maintenance is completed, reset the counters to allow the next maintenance to be
completed at the correct time. On many types of printers, the page count is viewed through
the LCD or a counter located inside the main cover.
Most manufacturers sell maintenance kits for their printers. Figure 14-12 shows a sample
maintenance kit. The kit has instructions that any technician can follow. For laser printers,
the kit can contain replacement parts that often break or wear out:
■Fuser assembly
■Transfer rollers
■Separation pads
■Pickup rollers
Figure 14-12 Maintenance Kit
20
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Fuser Assembly
Separation Pads
Transfer Roller
Pickup Roller

Each time you install new parts or replace toners and cartridges, do a visual inspection of
all the internal components:
■Remove bits of paper and dust.
■Clean spilled ink.
■Look for any worn gears, cracked plastic or broken parts.
Users that do not know how to maintain printing equipment should call a manufacturer-cer-
tified technician.
Worksheet 14.5.1: Search for Certified Printer Technician Jobs
For this worksheet, you will use the Internet to gather information about becoming a certi-
fied printer technician. Be prepared to discuss your answers with the class. Refer to the
worksheet in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third
Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can complete this worksheet now or wait to do so until
the end of the chapter. 
Describe a Suitable Environment for Printers and
Scanners
Printers and scanners, like all other electrical devices, are affected by temperature, humidi-
ty, and electrical interference. For example, laser printers produce heat. Operate them in
well-ventilated areas to prevent overheating. If possible, store all printers, scanners, and
supplies in a cool and dry place, away from dust. This will ensure that they will work prop-
erly and for a long time.
Keep paper and toner cartridges in their original wrappers and in a cool, dry environment.
High humidity causes paper to absorb moisture from the air. This makes it difficult for the
toner to attach to the paper correctly. If the paper and printer are dusty, you can use com-
pressed air to blow away the dust.
Operating environment guidelines are as follows:
■Keep paper dry.
■Keep printer in a cool, dust-free environment.
■Store toner in a clean, dry environment.
■Clean glass on scanners.
Chapter 14: Advanced Printers and Scanners
21

Describe Cleaning Methods
Always follow the manufacturer’s guidelines when cleaning printers and scanners.
Information on the manufacturer’s website or in the user manual explains the proper clean-
ing methods.
Caution
Remember to unplug scanners and printers before cleaning to prevent danger from high voltage.
Printer Maintenance
Make sure that you turn off and unplug any printer before performing printer maintenance.
Use a damp cloth to wipe off any dirt, paper dust, and spilled ink on the exterior of the
device.
Print heads in an inkjet printer are replaced when the cartridges are replaced. However,
sometimes print heads become clogged and require cleaning. Use the utility supplied by the
manufacturer to clean the print heads. After you clean them, you should test them. Repeat
this process until the test shows a clean and uniform print.
Printers have many moving parts. Over time, the parts collect dust, dirt, and other debris. If
not cleaned regularly, the printer might not work well, or could stop working. When work-
ing with dot matrix printers, clean the roller surfaces with a damp cloth. On inkjet printers,
clean the paper-handling machinery with a damp cloth.
Caution
Do not touch the drum of a laser printer while cleaning. You can damage the surface of the drum.
Laser printers do not usually require much maintenance unless they are in a dusty area or
they are very old. When cleaning a laser printer, use a specially designed vacuum cleaner to
pick up toner particles. Figure 14-13 shows a vacuum designed for electronic equipment. A
standard vacuum cleaner cannot hold the tiny particles of toner and can scatter them about.
Use only a vacuum cleaner with HEPA filtration. HEPA filtration catches microscopic par-
ticles within the filters.
Choosing the correct paper type for a printer helps the printer last longer and print more
efficiently. Several types of paper are available. Each type of paper is clearly labeled with
the type of printer for which it is intended. The manufacturer of the printer might also rec-
ommend the best type of paper. Check the printer manual.
Information about the brands and types of ink recommended by the manufacturer is also
found in the manual. Using the wrong type of ink can cause the printer not to work or can
reduce the print quality. To prevent ink leaks, do not refill ink cartridges.
22

Scanner Maintenance
For proper scanner maintenance, you should clean scanners regularly to prevent dirt, fin-
gerprints, and other smudges from showing in scanned images. On flatbed scanners, keep
the lid closed when the scanner is not in use. This will help to prevent dust buildup and
accidental fingertip smudges. If the glass becomes dirty, consult the user guide for the man-
ufacturer’s cleaning recommendations. If the manual does not list any recommendations,
use a glass cleaner and a soft cloth to protect the glass from scratching. Even very small
scratches can be visible on high-resolution scans. If dirt becomes lodged in the scratches,
the scratches will become more visible.
If the inside of the glass becomes dirty, check the manual for instructions on how to open
the unit or remove the glass from the scanner. If possible, thoroughly clean both sides and
replace the glass as it was originally installed in the scanner. 
Describe Checking Capacity of Ink Cartridges and
Toners
When an inkjet printer produces blank pages, the ink cartridges can be empty. Laser print-
ers, however, do not produce blank pages, but do begin to print very poor-quality printouts.
Most inkjet printers provide a utility that shows ink levels in each cartridge, as shown in
Figure 14-14. Some printers have LCD message screens or LED lights that warn users
when ink supplies are low.
A method for checking ink levels is to look at the page counter inside the printer or the
printer software to determine how many pages have been printed. Then look at the cartridge
label information. The label should show how many pages the cartridge can print. You can
then easily estimate how many more pages you can print. For this method to be accurate,
each time you replace the cartridge, you must remember to reset the counter. In addition,
some printouts use more ink than others do. For example, a letter uses less ink than a photo-
graph.

Figure 14-14 Estimated Ink Level
24
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
You can set the printer software to reduce the amount of ink or toner that the printer uses.
This setting might be called “toner save” or “draft quality.” This setting reduces the print
quality of laser and inkjet products and reduces the time it takes to print a document on an
inkjet printer. 
Troubleshoot Printers and Scanners
With printer and scanner problems, a technician must be able to determine whether the
problem exists with the device, cable connection, or the computer that it is attached to.
Follow the steps outlined in the following sections to accurately identify, repair, and docu-

familiar with networking technologies. You must understand the basics of how a network is
designed and why some components affect the flow of data on a network.
This chapter focuses on advanced networking topics, including network design, network
component upgrades, and e-mail server installations. Basic networking topics such as safe-
ty, network components, and preventive maintenance are also discussed. This chapter also
describes troubleshooting advanced network situations.
Identify Potential Safety Hazards and
Implement Proper Safety Procedures Related
to Networks
Installing network cables, whether copper or fiber-optic, can be dangerous. Often, cables
must be pulled through ceilings and walls where there are obstacles and unexpected or toxic
materials. You should wear clothing that protects you from these materials. For example,
wear long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, sturdy shoes that cover your feet, and gloves. Most
importantly, wear safety glasses. If possible, ask building management, or someone respon-
sible for the building, if there are any dangerous materials or obstacles that you need to be
aware of before entering the ceiling area.
Be aware of these safety issues when using a ladder:
■Read the labels on the ladder, and follow any safety instructions written on it.
■Never stand on the top rung of the ladder. You could easily lose your balance and fall.
■Make sure that people in the area know you will be working there.
■Cordon off the area with caution tape or safety cones.
■When you are using a ladder that leans up against a wall, follow the instructions writ-
ten on the ladder, and have someone hold the ladder to help keep it steady.
The tools required to install copper and fiber-optic cable may be dangerous to use. When
working with cables, follow these rules:
■Make sure that the tools you are using are in good working order.
■Watch what you are doing, and take your time. Make sure that you do not cut yourself
or place anyone in danger.
■Always wear safety glasses when cutting, stripping, or splicing cables of any kind. Tiny
fragments can injure your eyes.
■Wear gloves whenever possible, and dispose of any waste properly.
2
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Use common sense when installing cables and fixing network problems. Call another per-
son to help you if you need assistance.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Explain fiber-optic safety.
■Explain cable, cable cutters, and cable-cutting safety hazards.
Explain Fiber-Optic Safety
Fiber-optic cables are useful for communications, but they have certain hazards:
■Dangerous chemicals
■Tools with sharp edges
■Light that you cannot see that can burn your eyes
■Glass shards produced by cutting fiber-optic cable that can cause bodily harm
Specific types of tools and chemicals are used when working with fiber-optic cable. These
materials must be handled safely.
Chemicals
The solvents and glues used with fiber optics are dangerous. You should handle them with
extreme care. Read any instructions, and follow them carefully. Also, read the material safe-
ty data sheet (MSDS) that accompanies the chemicals to know how to treat someone in an
emergency.
Tools
When working with any tool, safety should always be your first priority. Any compromise
in safety could result in serious injury or even death. The tools used for working with fiber
optics have sharp cutting surfaces that are used to scribe glass. Other tools pinch cables
with high pressure to fasten connectors to them. These tools can produce shards of glass
that can splinter and fly into the air. You must avoid getting them on your skin and in your
mouth or eyes.
Harmful Light
Protect your eyes from the harmful light that may be in the fiber-optic strands. The light is a
color that humans cannot see. It can damage your eyes before you can feel it. When you use
a magnifier to inspect fiber-optic cable and connectors, the light emitted from the fiber
could be directed into your eyes. When working with fiber, be sure to disconnect the light
source. Special detectors can tell you if a fiber is energized.
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks

Glass Shards
The process of cutting and trimming the strands of fiber-optic cables can produce tiny frag-
ments of glass or plastic that can penetrate your eyes or skin and cause severe irritation. The
fibers can be extremely difficult to see on your skin because they are clear and small. When
you work with fiber-optic cabling, the working surface should be a dark mat so that you can
see the tiny glass or plastic fragments. The mat should also be resistant to chemical spills.
You should keep the work area clean and neat. Never pick up fiber-optic fragments with
your fingers. Use tape to pick up small fragments, and dispose of them properly. Use a dis-
posable container, such as a plastic bottle with a screw-on lid, to store fiber fragments.
Close the lid tightly before disposing of the container. 
Caution
Obtain proper training before you attempt to cut, strip, or splice fiber-optic cable. An experienced
technician should supervise you until you become adequately skilled.
Explain Cable, Cable Cutters, and Cable-Cutting
Safety Hazards
All levels of technicians should know the hazards before working with network cables and
equipment. This section describes the safety hazards of working with copper cables, which,
like fiber-optic cables, can be dangerous to handle.
Caution
When handling cable, always wear eye protection. Never touch the ends of any type of cable to bare
skin.
When you cut copper cable, the small copper strands can puncture your skin or cut you.
The small pieces that come off after cables are cut often fly into the air. Remember to
always wear safety glasses when cutting any type of cable.
The cutting and crimping tools used to repair or terminate copper cables can be dangerous
if not used properly. Read the documentation that comes with the tool. Practice using the
tool on scrap cable, and ask an experienced installer for help if you need it.
Remember that copper cable conducts electricity. An equipment fault, static electricity, or
lightning can energize even a disconnected cable. If in doubt, test the cable you are working
on with a simple voltage detector before touching it.

Design a Network Based on the Customer’s
Needs
A network is most effective if it is designed to meet the customer’s needs. Building a net-
work requires analyzing the environment and understanding networking options. You should
interview the customer, as well as any other people involved in the project. It is important to
have a general idea about the hardware and software that will be used on the network. You
should inquire about future growth of the company and the network.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Determine a topology.
■Determine protocols and network applications.
Determine a Topology
You must understand the customer’s needs and determine the general layout of the new net-
work to properly determine the network topology. You need to discuss these important
issues with the customer:
■Cable and wireless types
■Scalability
■Number and location of users
The number of users and the estimated amount of future growth determine the network’s
initial physical and logical topology. You should create a checklist to record the customer’s
needs.
You should do an inspection, called a site survey, early in the project. A site survey is a
physical inspection of the building that helps determine a basic logical topology, which is
the flow of data and protocols. The number of users and the estimated amount of future
growth determine the network’s initial physical and logical topology. You should consider
the following factors:
■Where the users’ end-station computers will be.
■Where to position network equipment such as switches and routers.
■Where the servers will be positioned. This may be in the same room as the network
equipment, or it could be elsewhere. The decision is often based on available space,
power, security, and air conditioning.
A floor plan or blueprint is helpful to determine the physical layout of equipment and
cables. Figure 15-1 shows a comparison of network topologies, including bus, ring, star,
extended star, hierarchical, and mesh.
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks
5

Figure 15-1
Types of Topologies
6
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
If a floor plan or blueprint is not available, you should make a drawing of where the net-
work devices will be located, including the location of the server room, the printers, the end
stations, and cable runs. This drawing can be used for discussions when the customer
makes the final layout decisions.
Determine Protocols and Network Applications
When designing a network, you must determine which protocols will be used. Some proto-
cols are proprietary and work on only specific equipment, and others are open standards
and work on a variety of equipment. Here are the details of the various network protocols:
■Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) represents a set of public
standards that specify how packets of information are exchanged between computers
over one or more networks. The TCP/IP suite of protocols has become the dominant
standard for internetworking.
■Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX) is the pro-
tocol suite employed originally by Novell Corporation’s network operating system,
NetWare. It delivers functions similar to those included in TCP/IP. Novell in its current
releases supports the TCP/IP suite. A large installed base of NetWare networks contin-
ue to use IPX/SPX.
■NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI) is a protocol used primarily on small
Windows NT networks. NetBEUI cannot be routed or used by routers to talk to each
other on a large network. NetBEUI is suitable for small peer-to-peer networks involv-
ing a few computers directly connected to each other. It can be used in conjunction
with another routable protocol such as TCP/IP. This gives the network administrator the
advantages of the high performance of NetBEUI within the local network and the capa-
bility to communicate beyond the LAN over TCP/IP.

■AppleTalk is a protocol suite to network Macintosh computers. It consists of a com-
prehensive set of protocols that span the seven layers of the OSI reference model. The
AppleTalk protocol was designed to run over LocalTalk, which is the Apple LAN phys-
ical topology. It is also designed to run over major LAN types, notably Ethernet and
Token Ring.
■Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) governs how files such as text, graphics, sound,
and video are exchanged on the World Wide Web (WWW). The Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) developed the standards for HTTP.
■File Transfer Protocol (FTP) provides services for transferring files. FTP allows mul-
tiple simultaneous connections to remote file systems.
■Secure Shell (SSH) is used to securely connect to a remote computer.
■Telnet is an application used to connect to a remote computer, but it lacks security fea-
tures.
■Post Office Protocol (POP) is used to download e-mail from a remote mail server.
■Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is also used to download e-mail from a
remote mail server.
■Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to send e-mail to a remote e-mail
server.
Consider the following when selecting protocols:
■The TCP/IP suite of protocols is required for every device to connect to the Internet.
This makes it a preferred protocol for networking.
■NetBEUI is a small, fast protocol that is useful in low-security networks. NetBEUI per-
forms well in a small network that is not connected to the Internet. It is easy to install
and requires no configuration. However, NetBEUI can cause unnecessary traffic on a
large network, so it is not a good choice if the network will grow.
■IPX/SPX is a protocol that belongs to older versions of Novell Netware. Because of the
growth of the Internet, newer versions of Novell Netware use TCP/IP instead of
IPX/SPX.
■Apple Macintosh networks have abandoned the AppleTalk protocol for the TCP/IP
suite of protocols to ensure connectivity with other TCP/IP networks, most notably the
Internet.
When the TCP/IP protocol stack is enabled, other protocols become available on specific
ports, as shown in Table 15-1.

Determine the Components for the Customer’s
Network
The choice of network topology determines the type of devices, cables, and network inter-
faces that will be required to construct the network. In addition, an outside connection to an
Internet service provider (ISP) must be set up. One of the steps in building a network is to
determine suitable network components that work with user devices and the network
cabling.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Select cable types.
■Select the ISP connection type.
■Select network cards.
■Select the network device.
8
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Select Cable Types
Select the cable type that is the most beneficial and cost-effective for the users and services
that will connect to the network.
The size of the network determines the type of network cable that will be used. Most net-
works today are wired using one or more types of twisted-pair copper cable:
■Category 5 (Cat5)
■Category 5e (Cat5e)
■Category 6 (Cat6)
■Category 6a (Cat6a)
Cat5 and Cat5e cables look the same, but Cat5e cable is manufactured with a higher stan-
dard to allow for higher data transfer rates. Cat6 cable is constructed with even higher stan-
dards than Cat5e. Cat6 cable may have a center divider to separate the pairs inside the
cable.
The most common type of cable used in a network is Cat5e. Cat5e cable is an enhanced
version of Cat 5 that adds specifications for far-end crosstalk. It was formally defined in
2001 in the TIA/EIA-568-B standard, which no longer recognizes the original Cat5. Cat5e
is suitable for Fast Ethernet up to 330 feet (100 m).
Some businesses and homes have installed Cat6 cable so that they are prepared for addi-
tional bandwidth requirements in the future. Applications such as video, videoconferencing,
and gaming use a large amount of bandwidth. Cat6 features more stringent specifications
for crosstalk and system noise. The cable standard is suitable for 10BASE-T/100BASE-TX
and 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet) connections. It provides performance of up to 250 MHz.
The most recent type of twisted-pair cable available is Cat6a. Cat6a cable carries Ethernet
signals at a rate of 10 Gbps. The abbreviation for 10 Gigabit Ethernet over twisted-pair
cable is 10GBase-T, as defined in the IEEE 802.3an-2006 standard. Customers who need
high-bandwidth networks can benefit from installing cable that can support Gigabit Ethernet
or 10 Gigabit Ethernet.
New or renovated office buildings often have some type of UTP cabling that connects every
office to a central point called the main distribution facility (MDF). The distance limitation
of UTP cabling used for data is 330 feet (100 m). Network devices that are farther away
than this distance limitation need a repeater or hub to extend the connection to the MDF.
When designing a network and selecting cable types, you also need to consider cost, securi-
ty, future needs, and wireless options.
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks
9

Cost
When designing a network, cost is a consideration. Installing cables is expensive, but after a
one-time expense, a wired network normally is inexpensive to maintain. Most of the devices
on a wired network cost much less than the devices on a wireless network. 
Security
A wired network usually is more secure than a wireless network. The cables in a wired net-
work usually are installed in walls and ceilings and therefore are not easily accessible.
Wireless is easier to eavesdrop. The signals are available to anyone who has a receiver.
Making a wireless network as secure as a wired network requires the use of encryption.
Design for the Future
Many organizations install the highest-grade cable available to ensure that their networks
can handle the network speeds that will be available in the future. These organizations want
to avoid expensive reinstallation of cable later. You and your customer must decide if the
cost of installing a higher grade of cable is necessary.
Wireless
A wireless solution may be possible in places where cables cannot be installed. Consider an
older, historic building where local building codes do not permit structural modifications. In
this case, installing cable is not possible, so a wireless connection is the only solution. 
Select the ISP Connection Type
The ISP that you choose can have a noticeable effect on network service. Some private
resellers that connect to a phone company may sell more connections than allowed, which
slows the overall speed of the service to customers.
An Internet connection has three main considerations:
■Speed
■Reliability
■Availability
This section describes ISP connection types and the advantages and disadvantages of each.
Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)
A plain old telephone service (POTS) connection is extremely slow, but it is available
wherever there is a telephone. The modem uses the telephone line to transmit and receive
data.
10
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) offers faster connection times and has
faster speeds than dialup. It also allows multiple devices to share a single telephone line.
ISDN is very reliable because it uses POTS lines. ISDN is available in most places where
the telephone company supports digital signaling.
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
Digital subscriber line (DSL), like ISDN, allows multiple devices to share a single tele-
phone line. DSL speeds generally are faster than ISDN. DSL allows the use of high-band-
width applications and lets multiple users share the same connection to the Internet. In most
cases, the copper wires already in your home or business can carry the signals needed for
DSL communication.
DSL technology has some limitations. DSL service is not available everywhere. It works
better and faster the closer the installation is to the telephone provider’s central office (CO).
Also, DSL is much faster when receiving data over the Internet than when sending it. In
some cases, the lines that are in place to carry telephone signals do not technically qualify
to carry DSL signals.
Cable
Cable Internet connection does not use telephone lines. Cable uses coaxial cable lines origi-
nally designed to carry cable television. Like DSL, cable offers high speeds and an “always-
on” connection, which means that even when the connection is not in use, the connection to
the Internet is still available. Many cable companies offer telephone service as well.
Because cable television reaches many homes, it is an alternative for people unable to
receive DSL service. Theoretically, the bandwidth of cable is higher than DSL, but it can be
affected by limitations of the cable provider. Most homes that have cable television have the
option to install high-speed Internet service.
Satellite
For people who live in rural areas, broadband satellite Internet connections provide a high-
speed connection that is always on. A satellite dish is used to transmit and receive signals to
and from a satellite that relays these signals back to a service provider.
The cost of installation and the monthly service fees are much higher than those for DSL
and cable subscribers. Heavy storm conditions can degrade the quality of the connection
between the user and the satellite, or between the satellite and the provider, slowing down
or even disconnecting the connection. In most cases, the service provider provides a dialup
connection as a backup.
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks
11

Wireless
Many types of wireless Internet service are available. The same companies that offer cellu-
lar service may offer Internet service. PCMCIA and PCI cards are used to connect a com-
puter to the Internet. This service is not available in all areas.
Service providers may offer wireless Internet service using microwave technology in limit-
ed areas. Signals are transmitted directly to an antenna on the roof of the house or building.
Research the connection types that the ISPs offer before selecting an ISP. Check the servic-
es available in your area. Compare connection speeds, reliability, and cost before commit-
ting to a service agreement.

Worksheet 15.3.2: ISP Connection Types
In this worksheet, you identify the best ISP based on a given scenario. Refer to the work-
sheet in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition.
You may perform this worksheet now or wait until the end of the chapter. 
Select Network Cards
Every device on a network requires a network interface. Many types of network interfaces
exist:
■Most network interfaces for desktop computers are either integrated into the mother-
board or are an expansion card that fits into an expansion slot.
■Most laptop network interfaces are either integrated into the motherboard or fit into a
PCI Card or PCI Express Bus expansion slot.
■USB network adapters plug into any available USB port and can be used with both
desktops and laptops.
Before purchasing a NIC, you should research the speed, form factor, and capabilities that
the card offers. Check the speed and capabilities of the hub or switch that will be connected
to the computer.
Ethernet NICs may be backward-compatible:
■If you have a 10/100-Mbps NIC and a hub that is only 10-Mbps, the NIC operates at
10 Mbps.
■If you have a 10/100/1000-Mbps NIC and a switch that operates at only 100 Mbps, the
NIC operates at 100 Mbps.
However, if you have a gigabit switch, you will most likely need to purchase a gigabit NIC
to match speeds. If plans exist to upgrade the network to Gigabit Ethernet in the future, be
sure to purchase NICs that can support the speed. Costs can vary greatly, so select NICs
that match your customer’s needs.
Wireless NICs are available in many formats with many capabilities. You should select
wireless NICs based on the type of wireless network that is installed, as described in the
following examples:
■802.11b NICs can be used on 802.11g networks.
■802.11b and 802.11g NICs can be used on 802.11n networks.
■802.11a can be used only on a network that supports 802.11a.
Choose wireless cards that match your customer’s needs. You should know what wireless
equipment is in use and what will be installed on the network to ensure compatibility and
usability. Figure 15-2 shows four types of wireless network interfaces. 
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Select the Network Device
Several types of devices are available to connect components on a network, including hubs,
switches, routers, and ISP equipment. Select network devices to meet your customer’s
needs.
Hubs
A hub is used to share data between multiple devices on a section of the network. The hub
may connect to another networking device such as a switch or router that connects to other
sections of the network. The maximum speed of the network is determined by the speed of
the hub.
Hubs are used less often today because of the effectiveness and low cost of switches. Hubs
do not segment network traffic, so they decrease the amount of available bandwidth to any
device. In addition, because a hub cannot filter data, a lot of unnecessary traffic constantly
moves between all the devices connected to it.
One advantage of a hub is that it regenerates the data that passes through it. This means that
a hub can also function as a repeater. A hub can extend the reach of a network because
rebuilding the signal pulses overcomes the effects of distance.
Switches
In modern networks, switches have replaced hubs as the central point of connectivity. As
with a hub, the speed of the switch determines the maximum speed of the network.
However, switches filter and segment network traffic by sending data only to the device to
which it is supposed to be sent. This provides higher dedicated bandwidth to each device on
the network.

Switches maintain a switching table. The switching table contains a list of all MAC
addresses on the network and a list of which switch port can be used to reach a device with
a given MAC address. The switching table records MAC addresses by inspecting the source
MAC address of every incoming frame, as well as the port on which the frame arrives. The
switch then creates a switching table that maps MAC addresses to outgoing ports. When a
frame arrives that is destined for a particular MAC address, the switch uses the switching
table to determine which port to use to reach the MAC address. The frame is forwarded
from the port to the destination. When frames are sent from only one port to the destination,
other ports are unaffected, and bandwidth on the entire network is unaffected.
Routers
Routers connect networks. On a corporate network, one router port connects to the WAN
connection, and the other ports connect to the corporate LANs. The router becomes the
gateway, or path to the outside, for the LAN. In a home network, the router connects the
computers and network devices in the home to the Internet. In this case, the router is a
home gateway. The wireless router, shown in Figure 15-3, serves as a firewall and provides
wireless connectivity. When the home router provides multiple services, it may be called a
multifunction device.
Figure 15-3
Home Networking Devices
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks
15
ISP Equipment
When subscribing to an ISP, you should find out what type of equipment is available so that
you can select the most appropriate device. Many ISPs offer a discount on equipment that is
purchased at the time of installation.

Some ISPs may rent equipment on a month-to-month basis. This may be more attractive
because the ISP supports the equipment if it fails or if the technology needs to be changed
or upgraded. Home users may select to purchase equipment from the ISP because eventual-
ly the initial cost of the equipment will be less than the cost of renting the equipment.
Implement the Customer’s Network
Installing and implementing a network can be a complicated task. Even a small home net-
work installation can become difficult and time-consuming. However, careful planning
helps ensure an easier and faster installation.
Here is an installation checklist:
❏All parts are in
❏Installation is scheduled
❏Backups are available
❏Access to needed passwords
❏Extra supplies are handy
❏Install components
❏Test components
During the installation, the existing network may experience some downtime. For example,
building modifications and network cable installation can cause disruption. The project is
not complete until all devices have been installed, configured, and tested.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Install and test the customer’s network.
■Configure the customer’s Internet and network resources.
Install and Test the Customer’s Network
After you have determined the location of all network devices, you are ready to install the
network cables. In some new or newly renovated buildings, network cables may have been
installed during construction to avoid the problem of installing cables in finished walls later.
If there is no preinstalled cable, you have to install it or have it installed.
If you plan to install the cable yourself, you need time to prepare. All the necessary materi-
als should be available at the site at the time of installation, as well as the cable layout plan.
16
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

These steps outline the process of physically creating a network:
Step 1.
To install the cable in ceilings and behind walls, you perform a cable pull. One
person pulls the cable, and the other feeds the cable through the walls. Be sure to
label the ends of every cable. Follow a labeling scheme that is already in place,
or follow the guidelines outlined in TIA/EIA 606-A.
Step 2.
After the cables have been terminated on both ends, you should test them to
make sure there are no shorts or interference.
Step 3.
Make sure that network interfaces are properly installed in the desktops, laptops,
and network printers. After the network interfaces have been installed, configure
the client software and the IP address information on all the devices.
Step 4.
Install switches and routers in a secured, centralized location. All the LAN con-
nections terminate in this area. In a home network, you may need to install these
devices in separate locations, or you may have only one device.
Step 5.
Install an Ethernet patch cable from the wall connection to each network device.
Check to see if you have a link light on all network interfaces. In a home net-
work, make sure that each network device port that connects to a device is lit.
Step 6.
When all devices are connected and all link lights are functioning, you should
test the network for connectivity. Use the ipconfig /all command to view the IP
configuration on each workstation. Use the ping command to test basic connec-
tivity. You should be able to ping other computers on the network, including the
default gateway and remote computers. After you have confirmed basic connec-
tivity, you must configure and test network applications such as e-mail and an
Internet browser. 
Configure the Customer’s Internet and Network
Resources
After the network has been set up and tested, you should configure a web browser, such as
Microsoft Internet Explorer. You can configure browser settings and perform maintenance
tasks in the Internet Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-4.
Internet Explorer includes settings for temporary Internet files and the default browser. The
customer may also need you to configure network resources such as file and printer sharing.
The next sections describe these topics.
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks
17
How To

Figure 15-4
Internet Explorer Options
18
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Temporary Internet Files
When an operating system such as Windows XP has been installed, Internet Explorer is
also installed by default. With Internet Explorer, every time you visit a website, many files
are downloaded to your computer in the Temporary Internet Files folder. Most of these files
are image files that represent banners and other components of the website.
Temporary Internet files are stored on your computer so that the browser can load content
faster the next time you visit a website you have been to before. Depending on the number
of websites you visit, the Temporary Internet Files folder can fill up quickly. Although this
may not be an urgent problem, you should delete the files occasionally. This is especially
important after you have done online banking or have entered other personal information
into the web browser.
Default Browser
You can confirm which browser Windows uses by default. Choose Start > Run, enter a
website address, and click OK. The website opens in the browser that is currently set as the
default.
If you want Internet Explorer to be your default browser, start by opening Internet Explorer.
On the toolbar, choose Tools > Internet Options. On the Programs tab, you can check to
see if Internet Explorer is your default browser, and select it if desired.

File Sharing
Users can share resources over the network. You can share a single file, specific folders, or
an entire drive.
To share a file, first copy it to a folder. Right-click the folder and select Sharing and
Security. Next, select Share this folder. You can identify who has access to the folder and
what permissions they have on the objects in the folder. Figure 15-5 shows the permissions
window of a shared folder.
Figure 15-5
Share Folder Permissions
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks
19
Permissions define the type of access a user has to a file or folder:
■Read allows the user to view the file and subfolder names, navigate to subfolders, view
data in files, and run program files.
■Change has the same permissions as the Read permission and also allows the user to
add files and subfolders, change the data in files, and delete subfolders and files.
■Full Control has the same permissions as Change and Read. If the file or folder is in
an NTFS partition, Full Control allows you to change permissions on the file or folder
and take ownership of the file or folder.
Windows XP Professional is limited to a maximum of ten simultaneous file-sharing
connections.

Printer Sharing
To share a printer, choose Start > Control Panel > Printers and Faxes. Right-click the
printer icon and select Sharing. Click Share this Printer, and then click OK. The printer
is now available for other computers to access.
To access a printer shared by another computer, choose Start > Control Panel > Printers
and Faxes. Choose File > Add Printer. Use the Add Printers wizard to find and install
the shared network printer.

Upgrade the Customer’s Network
You must be able to upgrade, install, and configure components when a customer asks for
increased speed or new functionality to be added to a network. Devices such as wireless
access points, wireless network cards, and faster network equipment and cable can be inte-
grated into a network to allow the customer to communicate wirelessly or more quickly.
If your customer is adding computers or wireless functionality, you should be able to rec-
ommend equipment based on their needs. The equipment that you suggest must work with
the existing equipment and cabling, or the existing infrastructure must be upgraded.
Network upgrades include
■Cable type
■Type of NIC
■Additional functionality (wireless, print server, and so on)
20
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Install and configure a wireless NIC.
■Install and configure wireless routers.
■Test the connection.
Install and Configure a Wireless NIC
To connect to a wireless network, your computer must have a wireless network interface. A
wireless network interface is used to communicate with other wireless devices, such as
computers, printers, and wireless access points.
Before purchasing a wireless adapter, you should make sure that it is compatible with other
wireless equipment that is already installed on the network. Also, verify that the wireless
adapter is the correct form factor to fit in a desktop or laptop. A wireless USB adapter can
be used with any desktop or laptop computer that has an open USB port.
To install a wireless NIC on a desktop computer, you must remove the case cover. Install
the wireless NIC into an available PCI slot or PCI express slot. Some wireless NICs have
an antenna connected to the back of the card. Some antennas are attached with a cable so
that they can be moved around or away from objects that may cause a poor connection.
After the wireless adapter is installed, you must perform additional configuration steps.
These include configuring device drivers and entering network address information. When
this is complete, the computer should be able to detect and connect to the wireless LAN.
Wireless network adapters may use a wizard to connect to the wireless network. In this
case, you would insert the CD that comes with the adapter and follow the directions to get
connected.

In this lab, you install a wireless NIC. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and
Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You may perform this lab now or wait until
the end of the chapter. 
Install and Configure Wireless Routers
When installing a wireless network, you have to decide where you want to put access
points, and then configure them. The following steps describe the installation of an access
point:
Step 1.
Use a floor plan to find locations for access points that allow maximum cover-
age. The best place for a wireless access point is at the center of the area you are
covering, with a line of sight between the wireless devices and the access point.
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks
21
How To

Step 2.
Connect the access point to the existing network. On the back of the Linksys
WRT300N router are five ports. Connect a DSL or cable modem to the port
labeled “Internet.” The device’s switching logic forwards all the packets through
this port when communication exists to and from the Internet and other connect-
ed computers. Connect one computer to any of the remaining ports to access the
configuration web pages.
Step 3.
Turn on the broadband modem, and plug the power cord into the router. When
the modem finishes establishing a connection to the ISP, the router automatically
communicates with the modem to receive network information from the ISP that
is necessary to gain access to the Internet: IP address, subnet mask, and DNS
server addresses.
Step 4.
When the router has established communication with the modem, you must con-
figure the router to communicate with the devices on the network. Turn on the
computer that is connected to the router. Open a web browser. In the Address
field, enter 192.168.1.1. This is the default address for router configuration and
management.
Step 5.
A security window prompts you for authentication to access the router configu-
ration screens. Leave the user name field empty. Enter admin as the default
password. When you are logged in, the first setup screen appears.
Step 6.
Continue with the setup. The setup screen has tabs that have subtabs. You must
click Save Settings at the bottom of each screen after making any changes.
When you use the configuration screens of the 300N router, you can click the Help tab to
see additional information about a tab. For information beyond what is shown on the help
screen, consult the user manual.
Lab 15.5.2: Configure a Wireless Router
In this lab, you install a wireless router. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and
Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition. You may perform this lab now or wait until
the end of the chapter. 
Test the Connection
It may be difficult to know if your wireless connection is working properly, even when
Windows indicates that you are connected. You may be connected to a wireless access point
or home gateway, but you may not be connected to the Internet. The easiest way to test for
an Internet connection is to open a web browser and see if the Internet is available. To trou-
bleshoot a wireless connection, you can use the Windows GUI or CLI.
22
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Using the Windows XP GUI to Verify Network Connections
To verify a wireless connection using the Windows XP GUI, choose Start > Control Panel >
Network Connections, as shown in Figure 15-6. Double-click the wireless network connec-
tion to display the status.
Figure 15-6
Network Connections
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks
23
The Connection Status screen, shown in Figure 15-7, displays the number of packets that
have been sent and received. The packets are the communication between the computer and
the network device. The window shows whether the computer is connected, along with the
connection’s speed and duration.
To display the Address Type, as shown in Figure 15-8, choose the Support tab on the
Connection Status screen. The Connection Status information includes either a static
address, which is assigned manually, or a dynamic address, which is assigned by a DHCP
server. The subnet mask and default gateway are also listed. To access the MAC address and
other information about the IP address, click Details. If the connection is not functioning
correctly, click Repair to reset the connection information and attempt to establish a new
connection.

Using the ping Command to Test Connectivity Between Devices
The ping command is a CLI tool used to test connectivity between devices. You can test
your own connection by pinging your computer. To test your computer, ping your NIC.
Choose Start > Run and enter cmd. At the command prompt, enter ping localhost. This
command tells you if your adapter is working properly.
Ping your default gateway to check if your WAN connection is working properly. You can
find the address for the default gateway by using the ipconfig command.
To test the Internet connection and DNS, ping a popular website. Choose Start > Run and
enter cmd. At the command prompt, enter ping destination name.
The response of the ping command displays the domain’s IP address resolution. The
response shows replies from the ping or shows that the request timed out because a problem
occurred.
Using the tracert Command to Trace Packets
The tracert command is a CLI tool that traces the route that packets take from your com-
puter to a destination address. Choose Start > Run and enter cmd. At the command prompt,
enter tracert.
The first listing in the window for the tracert result is the default gateway. Each listing after
that is the router that packets are traveling through to reach the destination. Tracert shows
you where packets are stopping, indicating where the problem is occurring. If listings show
problems after the default gateway, this might mean that the problems are with the ISP, the
Internet, or the destination server.

Describe the Installation, Configuration, and
Management of a Simple Mail Server
An e-mail system uses e-mail client software on the users’ devices, and e-mail server soft-
ware on one or more e-mail servers. This section describes the protocols and servers that
enable e-mail communication.
Understanding E-mail Protocols
Clients read e-mail from the e-mail server using one of two protocols:
■POP
■IMAP
Clients send e-mail to an e-mail server, and e-mail servers forward e-mail to each other,
using SMTP.
You need to know how to configure a client computer to accept the correct incoming mail
format, and also understand the process for setting up a mail server. You can configure the
e-mail client software using connection wizards, as shown in Figure 15-9.
Figure 15-9

SMTP sends e-mail from an e-mail client to an e-mail server, or from one e-mail server to
another. SMTP has these characteristics:
■Simple, text-based protocol
■Sent over TCP using port 25
■Must be implemented to send e-mail
■Message is sent after recipients are identified and verified
An e-mail client uses POP to download e-mail from an e-mail server. The most recent ver-
sion of POP is POP3. POP3 usually uses port 110.
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks
27

POP3 supports end users who have intermittent connections, such as dialup. A POP3 user
can connect, download e-mail from the server, delete the e-mail, and then disconnect.
IMAP is similar to POP3, but it has additional features. Like POP3, IMAP allows you to
download e-mail from an e-mail server using an e-mail client. The difference is that IMAP
allows the user to organize e-mail on the network e-mail server. IMAP is faster than POP3
and requires more disk space on the server and more CPU resources. The most recent ver-
sion of IMAP is IMAP4. IMAP4 is often used in large networks such as a university cam-
pus. IMAP usually uses port 143.
Installing the E-mail Server
An e-mail server is a computer that can send and receive e-mail on behalf of e-mail clients.
Common e-mail servers include the following:
■Microsoft Exchange
■Sendmail
■Eudora Internet Mail Server (EIMS)
As shown in Figure 15-10, wizards and tools often are available to guide you in setting up
an e-mail server. To install and set up an e-mail server, such as Microsoft Exchange, you
must first make sure that the network has all the proper qualifications in place and that it is
properly configured. Be prepared with the proper equipment and information:
■Fully functional and reliable DNS deployment
■Active Directory domain
■At least one global catalog
■Windows 2000 or higher native domain functionality
■Exchange server software
■Windows server support tools
■Schema master server
■High-speed Internet connection
Note
Before planning an e-mail server installation, consult with network professionals, experienced
Windows networking experts, or experienced e-mail technicians.
Active Directory servers, global catalog servers, and Domain Name System (DNS) servers
must all be in place and functioning before Exchange can be installed and work properly.
An Active Directory server is a computer that hosts a database that allows centralized
administration over an enterprise network. A global catalog server is a centralized reposito-
ry that contains information about every domain in an enterprise network.
28
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Figure 15-10 Exchange Server Installation Screen
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks
29
The Active Directory database is organized in a pattern called a schema. One server running
Windows 2003 is designated as the schema master. This is the only server that can change
how the Active Directory user database is organized. When the network administrator needs
to modify the Active Directory structure, the change is made on the schema master. Active
Directory then automatically copies the update to the rest of the authentication servers.
You should test the environment before you install Exchange. To prevent the installation
from affecting the daily operation of your network, set up the services required, and install
Exchange on a dedicated set of servers away from the main network. Keep the installation
of Exchange separate from your production network until you are sure that it is functioning
properly. 
You are ready to install the mail server when all the qualifications of your network are in
place. You have to add Internet Information Services (IIS) using the Add/Remove Windows
Components wizard before initiating the installation of the Exchange server. IIS is a server
that has programs used to build and administer website services. After IIS has been
installed, Exchange can be installed. Insert the installation CD and begin the New Exchange
installation wizard.
The installation wizard takes you through a series of steps to verify that Exchange is ready
to be installed. The wizard checks to make sure that IIS is installed, the domain servers are
running properly, and the Windows support tools are installed. The setup program notifies
you of any problems with the installation environment. Restart the setup program from the
beginning after fixing any issues. 

Managing the E-mail Server
After Exchange is installed, the Microsoft Management Console plugin for Exchange pro-
vides access to many settings in one convenient location. Be sure to install all updates so
that the server will run properly. The Exchange System Manager, which is a console that
controls the Exchange deployment, can be used to manage the server’s options.
Use the Active Directory Users and Computer (ADUC) console to configure a user’s mail-
box. This is also known as making the user “mailbox-enabled.”
Open the ADUC to create a new user. Fill out the username and password information
according to the domain security policy. The exchange server creates the user’s mailbox
when the user receives the first e-mail.
Setting up Exchange takes careful planning, including ensuring that the servers, services,
and technologies are in place and working correctly on the network. In some cases, during
an installation, if a failure occurs, you may need to reinstall the operating system and start
the Exchange installation from the beginning. 
Describe Preventive Maintenance Procedures
for Networks
Preventive maintenance is just as important for the network as it is for the computers on a
network. You must check the condition of cables, network devices, servers, and computers
to make sure that they are kept clean and are in good working order. You should develop a
plan to perform scheduled maintenance and cleaning at regular intervals. This helps you
prevent network downtime and equipment failures.
As part of a regularly scheduled maintenance program, inspect all cabling for breaks. Make
sure that cables are labeled correctly and labels are not coming off. Replace any worn or
unreadable labels. Check that cable supports are properly installed and that no attachment
points are coming loose. Cabling can become damaged and worn. You should keep the
cabling in good repair to maintain good network performance.
As a technician, you may notice if equipment is failing, damaged, or making unusual
sounds. Inform the network administrator to prevent unnecessary network downtime.
Cables at workstations and printers should be checked carefully. Cables are often moved or
kicked when they are under desks, and they can be bent. These conditions can result in loss
of bandwidth or connectivity. You should also be proactive in the education of network
users. Demonstrate to network users how to properly connect and disconnect cables, as well
as how to move them if necessary. 
30
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Troubleshoot the Network
To begin troubleshooting a network problem, you should first try to locate the source of the
problem. Check to see if a group of users or only one user has the problem. If the problem
is with one user, begin troubleshooting the problem starting with that person’s computer.
After completing this section, you will meet these objectives:
■Review the troubleshooting process.
■Identify common problems and solutions.
■Apply troubleshooting skills.
Review the Troubleshooting Process
Network problems can result from a combination of hardware, software, and connectivity
issues. Computer technicians must be able to analyze the problem and determine the cause
of the error to repair the network issue. This process is called troubleshooting.
Review the following troubleshooting process:
Step 1.
Gather data from the customer.
Step 2.
Verify the obvious issues.
Step 3.
Try quick solutions first.
Step 4.
Gather data from the computer.
Step 5.
Evaluate the problem and implement the solution.
Step 6.
Close with the customer.
The first step in the troubleshooting process is to gather data from the customer.
Ask the customer open-ended questions about network errors. (The following list is not
comprehensive.)
■When did the problem start?
■What problems are you experiencing?
■Can you tell me anything else about the problem?
■What other users are having the problem?
■What type of equipment is having the problem?
■What are the effects of the problem?
■Describe your work environment.
■When did you last back up your computer?
Chapter 15: Advanced Networks
31
How To

■What type of backup did you perform?
■What group are you a member of?
Ask the customer closed-ended questions about network errors. (The following list is not
comprehensive.) 
■Has any equipment changed?
■Have any peripherals been added?
■Have any other computers been added to the network?
■Have you rebooted the equipment?
After you talk to the customer, you should verify the obvious issues. Issues that apply to
networks include the following:
■What is your IP information?
■Are the settings on the network equipment correct?
■Is there activity on the wireless router?
■Is there activity on the modem?
■Is your wireless client configured correctly?
■Has your network connection been disabled?
After you have verified the obvious issues, try the following quick solutions to network
problems:
■Restart the equipment.
■Renew the IP address.
■Flush DNS.
■Roll back a driver.
■Return to the previous saved restore point.
If quick solutions do not correct the problem, it is time to gather data from the computer.
Here are some different ways to gather information about the network problem:
■Open Device Manager.
■Open Event Viewer.
■Use ipconfig.
■Ping the localhost.
■Ping the local IP address.
32
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Ping the default gateway.
■Ping a popular website.
■Verify wireless router configuration.
■Verify e-mail client configuration.
At this point, you have enough information to evaluate the problem and then research and
implement possible solutions. When researching possible solutions for a problem, use the
following resources:
■Problem-solving experience
■Other technicians
■Internet search
■Newsgroups
■Manufacturer FAQs
■Computer manuals
■Device manuals
■Online forums
■Technical websites
After you have solved the problem, you close with the customer. Tasks required to complete
this step include the following:
■Discuss the solution implemented with the customer.
■Have the customer verify that the problem has been solved.
■Provide the customer with all the paperwork.
■Document the steps taken to solve the problem in the work order and the technician’s
journal.
■Document any components used in the repair.
■Document the time spent to resolve the problem.
Identify Common Problems and Solutions
Network problems can be attributed to hardware, software, networks, or some combination
of the three. You will resolve some types of problems more often than others. Table 15-5 is
a chart of common network problems and solutions.

This chapter reviews the types of attacks that threaten the security of computers and the
data contained on them. A technician is responsible for the security of data and computer
equipment in an organization. The chapter describes how you can work with customers to
ensure that the best possible protection is in place.
Risks to computers and network equipment come from both internal and external sources.
Risks include physical threats, such as theft or damage to equipment, and data threats, such
as the loss or corruption of data.
After completing this chapter, you will meet these objectives:
■Outline security requirements based on customer needs
■Select security components based on customer needs
■Implement a customer’s security plan
■Perform preventive maintenance on security
■Troubleshoot security
Outline Security Requirements Based on
Customer Needs
An organization should strive to achieve the best and most affordable security protection
against data loss or damage to software and equipment. Network technicians and the orga-
nization’s management should work together to develop a security policy to ensure that data
and equipment have been protected against all security threats. A security policy includes a
comprehensive statement about the level of security required and how this security will be
achieved.
You might be involved in developing a security policy for a customer or organization. When
creating a security policy, you should ask the following questions to determine security factors:
■Is the computer located at a home or a business? Home computers generally are
more vulnerable to wireless intrusion than business computers. Business computers
have a higher threat of network intrusion, because of users abusing their access privi-
leges.
■Is there full-time Internet access? The more a computer is exposed to the Internet,
the greater the chance of attacks from other infected computers. A computer accessing
the Internet should include firewall and antivirus solutions.
■Is the computer a laptop? Physical security is an issue with laptop computers. There
are measures to secure laptops, such as cable locks.

Outline a Local Security Policy
A security policy is a collection of rules, guidelines, and checklists. Network technicians
and managers of an organization work together to develop the rules and guidelines for the
security needs of computer equipment. A security policy includes the following elements:
■Defines an acceptable computer usage statement for an organization.
■Identifies the people permitted to use the computer equipment in an organization.
■Identifies devices that are permitted to be installed on a network, as well as the condi-
tions of the installation. Modems and wireless access points are examples of hardware
that could expose the network to attacks.
■Defines the requirements necessary for data to remain confidential on a network.
■Determines a process for employees to acquire access to equipment and data. This
process can require the employee to sign an agreement regarding the company rules. It
also lists the consequences for failure to comply.

The security policy should also provide detailed information about the following issues in
case of an emergency:
■Steps to take after a breach in security
■Who to contact in an emergency
■Information to share with customers, vendors, and the media
■Secondary locations to use in an evacuation
■Steps to take after an emergency is over, including the priority of services to be
restored
Caution
A security policy must be enforced and followed by all employees to be effective.
Here is an example of an emergency checklist:
■Data loss:
■Because of equipment theft
■Because of wiretapping
■Because of internal personnel
■Because of external personnel
■Because of temporary personnel/contractors/vendors
■Power-related emergencies:
■Building or floor power outage
■Local power outage
■Large or regional power outage
■Terrorist action:
■Terrorist attacks leading to evacuation
■Terrorist attacks leading to lockdown
■Theft:
■Physical theft of network device
■Physical theft of desktop computer
■Physical theft of laptop

Explain When and How to Use Security Hardware
The security policy should identify hardware and equipment that can be used to prevent
theft, vandalism, and data loss. There are four interrelated aspects to physical security,
which are access, data, infrastructure, and the computer, as illustrated in Figure 16-2. 
Figure 16-2
Physical Security
Chapter 16: Advanced Security

Restrict access to premises with the following:
■Fences
■Security hardware
Protect the network infrastructure, such as cabling, telecommunication equipment, and net-
work devices by implementing the following measures:
■Secured telecommunications rooms
■Wireless detection for unauthorized access points
■Hardware firewalls
■Network management system that detects changes in wiring and patch panels

Protect individual computers by using the following:
■Cable locks
■Laptop docking station locks
■Lockable cases
■Secured cages surrounding desktop cases
Protect data with hardware that prevents unauthorized access or theft of media through the
use of the following:
■Lockable hard drive carriers
■Secure storage and transport of backup media
■USB security dongles
Factors that determine the most effective security equipment to use to secure equipment and
data include the following:
■How the equipment will be used
■Computer equipment location
■User-required access to data
For example, a computer in a busy public place, such as a library, requires additional pro-
tection from theft and vandalism. In a busy call center, a server might need to be secured in
a locked equipment room.
Where it is necessary to use a laptop computer in a public place, a security dongle, shown
in Figure 16-3, ensures that the system locks if the user and laptop are separated.

Explain When and How to Use Security Application
Software
Security applications protect the operating system and software application data.
The following products and software applications can be used to protect network devices:
■Software firewall: Filters incoming data and is built into Windows XP
■Intrusion detection systems (IDS): Monitor and report on changes in program code
and unusual network activity
■Application and OS patches: Update applications and the operating system to repair
security weaknesses that are discovered
Several software applications are available to protect computers from unauthorized access
by malicious computer code:
■Virus protection
■Spyware protection
■Adware protection
■Grayware protection
In small offices and homes, computers generally connect directly to the Internet rather than
through a protected LAN that organizations use. This puts computers outside of a LAN at
high risk for viruses and other attacks. At a minimum, these computers should use antivirus
and antimalware protection programs. Application software and the operating system should
be updated with the latest patches. A software firewall can also be part of the solution.
The security policy should determine the level of security applications put in place. Each
step that increases protection costs money. In developing a policy, management should cal-
culate the cost of data loss versus the expense of security protection and determine what
trade-offs are acceptable. 
Select Security Components Based on
Customer Needs
The security policy helps customers to select the security components necessary to keep
equipment and data safe. If there is no security policy, you should discuss security issues
with the customer.
Use your past experience as a technician and research the current security products on the
market when selecting security components for the customer. The goal is to provide the
security system that best matches the customer’s needs.
Chapter 16: Advanced Security

After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe and compare security techniques
■Describe and compare access control devices
■Describe and compare firewall types
Describe and Compare Security Techniques
A technician should determine the appropriate techniques to secure equipment and data for
the customer. Depending on the situation, more than one technique might be required. The
sections that follow describe the different techniques to secure equipment and data.
Passwords
Using secure, encrypted login information for computers with network access should be a
minimum requirement in any organization. Malicious software monitors the network and
can record plain-text passwords. If passwords are encrypted, attackers would have to decode
the encryption to learn the passwords.
Tip
As covered in Chapter 9, “Fundamental Security,” a strong password should contain a mixture of
numbers, special characters, and uppercase and lowercase letters and have a minimum number of
eight characters total.
Logging and Auditing
Event logging and auditing should be enabled to monitor activity on the network. The net-
work administrator audits the log file of events to investigate network access by unautho-
rized users.
Wireless Configurations
Wireless connections are especially vulnerable to access by attackers. Wireless clients
should be configured to encrypt data.
Encryption
Encryption technologies are used to encode data being transmitted on a network.
Hash encoding, or hashing, ensures that messages are not corrupted or tampered with dur-
ing transmission. Hashing uses a mathematical function to create a numeric value that is
unique to the data. If even one character is changed, the function output, called the message
digest, will not be the same. However, the function is one-way. Knowing the message digest
does not allow an attacker to re-create the message. This makes it difficult for someone to
8
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

intercept and change messages. Figure 16-4 illustrates the hash-encoding process. The
names of the most popular hashing algorithms are SHA and MD5.
Figure 16-4
Hash Encoding
Chapter 16: Advanced Security
9
Symmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption requires both sides of an encrypted conversation to use an encryption
key to be able to encode and decode the data. The sender and receiver must use identical
keys. Figure 16-5 illustrates the symmetric encryption process. 
Figure 16-5
Symmetric Encryption

Asymmetric Encryption
Asymmetric encryption requires two keys, a private key and a public key. A private key is
required for writing a message, and a public key is needed to decode the message. The
advantage of asymmetric encryption is that only the private key needs to be kept secret.
Public keys can be distributed openly by e-mail or by posting them on the web. Figure 16-6
illustrates the asymmetric encryption process.
Figure 16-6
Asymmetric Encryption

IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
Virtual Private Network
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) uses encryption to secure data as if it were traveling in a
private, corporate LAN, even though the data actually travels over any network, for exam-
ple, the Internet. The secured data pipelines between points in the VPN are called “secure
tunnels.” Figure 16-7 illustrates how a VPN is used to provide security.
Figure 16-7
Virtual Private Network

Describe and Compare Access Control Devices
Computer equipment and data can be secured using overlapping protection techniques to
prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. An example of overlapping protection is using
two different techniques to protect an asset. This is known as two-factor security. When
considering a security program, the cost of the implementation has to be balanced against
the value of the data or equipment to be protected.
One example of a two-factor security technique is as follows:
Password (good protection) + Biometrics or Smart Card (good protection) = Two-
Factor Security (much better protection)
Physical Security
Use security hardware to help prevent security breaches and loss of data or equipment.
Physical security access control measures include the following:
■Lock: The most common device for securing physical areas. If a key is lost, all identi-
cally keyed locks must be changed.
■Conduit: A casing that protects the infrastructure media from damage and unautho-
rized access.
■Card key: A tool used to secure physical areas. If a card key is lost or stolen, only the
missing card must be deactivated. The card key system is more expensive than security
locks.
■Video equipment: Records images and sound for monitoring activity. The recorded
data must be monitored for problems.
■Security guard: Controls access to the entrance of a facility and monitors the activity
inside the facility.
Network equipment should be mounted in secured areas. All cabling should be enclosed in
conduits or routed inside walls to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. Network out-
lets that are not in use should be disabled. If network equipment is damaged or stolen, some
network users can be denied service.
The security policy should specify the level of security required for the organization.
Biometric devices, which measure physical information about a user, are ideal for use in
highly secure areas. However, for most small organizations, this type of solution would be
too expensive.
Data Security
You can protect data by using data security devices to authenticate employee access. Two-
factor identification is a method to increase security. Employees must use both a password
and a data security device similar to those listed here to access data:
Chapter 16: Advanced Security
11

■Smart card: A device that can store data safely. The internal memory is an embedded
integrated circuit chip (ICC) that connects to a reader either directly or through a wire-
less connection. Smart cards are used in many applications worldwide, like secure ID
badges, online authentication devices, and secure credit card payments.
■Security key fob: A small device that resembles the ornament on a key ring. It has a
small radio system that communicates with the computer over a short range. The fob is
small enough so that many people attach them to their key rings. The computer must
sense the signal from the key fob before it will accept a username and password.
■Biometric device: Measures a physical characteristic of the user, such as fingerprints or
the patterns of the iris in the eye. The user is granted access if these characteristics
match its database and the correct login information is supplied.
The level of security that the customer needs determines which devices to select to keep
data and equipment secure.
Describe and Compare Firewall Types
Hardware and software firewalls protect data and equipment on a network from unautho-
rized access. A firewall should be used in addition to security software. 
A hardware firewall is a physical filtering component that inspects data packets from the
network before they reach computers and other devices on a network. Hardware firewalls
are often installed along with routers. A hardware firewall is a freestanding unit that does
not use the resources of the computers it is protecting, so there is no impact on processing
performance.
A software firewall is an application on a computer that inspects and filters data packets.
Windows Firewall is an example of a software firewall that is included in the Windows
operating system. A software firewall uses the resources of the computer, resulting in
reduced performance for the user.
Consider the items listed in Table 16-1 when selecting a firewall.

Little impact on computer performance. Uses the CPU, potentially slowing the computer.
12
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Hardware and software firewalls have several modes for filtering network data traffic:
■Packet filter: A set of rules that allow or deny traffic based on criteria such as IP
addresses, protocols, or ports used.
■Proxy firewall: A firewall that inspects all traffic and allows or denies packets based on
configured rules. A proxy acts as a gateway that protects computers inside the network.
■Stateful packet inspection: A firewall that keeps track of the state of network connec-
tions traveling through the firewall. Packets that are not part of a known connection are
not allowed back through the firewall.
Note
On a secure network, if computer performance is not an issue, you should enable the internal operat-
ing system firewall for additional security. Some applications might not operate properly unless the
firewall is configured correctly for them.
Worksheet 16.2.3: Research Firewalls
In this worksheet, you will use the Internet, a newspaper, or a local store to gather informa-
tion about hardware and software firewalls. Refer to the worksheet in IT Essentials: PC
Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide, Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You
can complete this worksheet now or wait to do so until the end of the chapter. 
Implement a Customer’s Security Policy
Adding layers of security to a network can make the network more secure, but additional
layers of security protection can be expensive. You must weigh the value of the data and
equipment to be protected with the cost of protection when implementing the customer’s
security policy.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Configure security settings
■Describe configuring firewall types
■Describe protection against malicious software
Configure Security Settings
Two common security errors are incorrect permissions on folders and files and incorrect
configuration of wireless security. The sections that follow examine appropriate permission
settings and wireless security configuration.
Chapter 16: Advanced Security
13

Levels of Permission for Folders and Files
Permission levels are configured to limit individual or group user access to specific data.
Both FAT and NTFS allow folder sharing and folder-level permissions for users with net-
work access. NTFS folder permissions are categorized as follows:
■Full Control: This allows the user or group to change permissions of the folder, take
ownership of it, and perform all activities included in all other permissions.
■Modify: Delete the folder plus perform actions permitted.
■Read and Execute: Move through folders to reach other files and folders, even if the
users don’t have permission for those folders, and perform actions permitted by the
Read permission and List Folder Contents permission.
■List Folder Contents: See the names of the files and subfolders in the folder.
■Read: See files and subfolders in the folder and view folder ownership, permission,
and attributes.
■Write: Create new files and subfolders within the folder, change folder attributes, and
view folder ownership and permissions.
NTFS provides additional security of file-level permissions:
■Full Control: Change permissions and take ownership, plus perform the actions per-
mitted by all other NTFS file permissions.
■Modify: Modify and delete the file, plus perform the actions permitted by the Write
permission and Read and Execute permission.
■Read and Execute: Run applications, plus perform the actions permitted by the Read
permission.
■Read: Read the file and view file attributes, ownership, and permissions.
■Write: Overwrite the file, change file attributes, and view file ownership and permis-
sions. 
Wireless Security Configuration
The following tools are used to configure wireless security:
■Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP): Encrypts the broadcast data between the wireless
access point and the client using a 64-bit or 128-bit encryption key. 
■Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA): Provides better encryption and authentication than
WEP.
■MAC address filtering: Restricts computer access to a wireless access point to prevent
the casual user from accessing the network. MAC address filtering is vulnerable when
used alone and should be combined with other security filtering.
14
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

■Service set identifier (SSID) broadcasting: The wireless SSID broadcasts the identity
of the network. Turning off the SSID makes the network seem to disappear, but this is
an unreliable form of wireless network security.
■Wireless antennas: The gain and signal pattern of the antenna connected to a wireless
access point can influence where the signal can be received. Avoid transmitting signals
outside of the network area by installing an antenna with a pattern that serves your net-
work users.
Remember to do the following when configuring wireless security:
■Configure WEP.
■Configure WPA.
■Configure MAC address filtering.
■Disable any unused wireless connections.
■Change default SSID.
■Select appropriate antennas.
To improve the security of your wireless device, you should implement as many security
options as possible. For example, this means combining things such as implementing WEP
and changing the SSID to improve security. 
Describe Configuring Firewall Types
A firewall selectively denies outside users from establishing connections to a computer or
network segment. Firewalls generally work by opening and closing the ports that various
applications use. By opening only the required ports on a firewall, you are implementing a
restrictive security policy. Any packet not explicitly permitted is denied. In contrast, a per-
missive security policy permits access through all ports except those explicitly denied. At
one time, software and hardware were shipped with all settings being permissive. As many
users neglected to configure their equipment, the default permissive settings left many
devices exposed to attackers. Most devices now ship with settings as restrictive as possible,
while still allowing easy setup.
Software firewalls usually exist as a software application running on the computer being
protected, or as part of the operating system. There are several third-party software fire-
walls. There is also a software firewall built into Windows XP, as shown in Figure 16-8.
Chapter 16: Advanced Security
15

Figure 16-8
Windows XP Firewall
16
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide
The configuration of the Windows XP Firewall can be completed in two ways:
■Automatically: The user is prompted to Keep Blocking, Unblock, or Ask Me Later for
any unsolicited requests. These requests can be from legitimate applications that have
not been configured previously or can be from a virus or worm that has infected the
system.
■Manage Security Settings: The user manually adds the program or ports that are
required for the applications in use on the network.
To add a program, choose Start > Control Panel > Security Center > Windows Firewall
> Exceptions > Add Program.
To disable the firewall, choose Start > Control Panel > Security Center > Windows
Firewall. 
Lab 16.3.2: Configure Windows XP Firewall
In this lab, you will explore the Windows XP Firewall and configure some advanced set-
tings. Refer to the lab in IT Essentials: PC Hardware and Software Labs and Study Guide,
Third Edition (ISBN 1-58713-198-6). You can perform this lab now or wait until the end of
the chapter.
Describe Protection Against Malicious Software
Malware is malicious software that is installed on a computer without the knowledge or
permission of the user. Certain types of malware, such as spyware and phishing attacks,
collect data about the user that can be used by an attacker to gain confidential information.

You should run virus- and spyware-scanning programs to detect and clean unwanted soft-
ware. Many browsers now come equipped with special tools and settings that prevent the
operation of several forms of malicious software. It might take several different programs
and multiple scans to completely remove all malicious software:
■Virus protection: Antivirus programs typically run automatically in the background
and monitor for problems. When a virus is detected, the user is warned and the pro-
gram attempts to quarantine or delete the virus.
■Spyware protection: Antispyware programs that scan for keyloggers and other mal-
ware so that it can be removed from the computer.
■Adware protection: Antiadware programs look for programs that display advertising
on your computer.
■Phishing protection: Antiphishing programs block the IP addresses of known phishing
websites and warn the user about suspicious websites.
A dangerous form of malicious software that incorporates elements of social engineering is
the phishing attack. Figure 16-9 demonstrates a phishing attack website.
Figure 16-9
Phishing Attack Example
Chapter 16: Advanced Security
17
Note
Malicious software can become embedded in the operating system. Special removal tools are avail-
able from the operating system manufacturer to clean the operating system. 

Perform Preventive Maintenance on Security
Several maintenance tasks are necessary to ensure that security is effective. The following
sections cover how to maximize protection by performing updates, backups, and reconfigu-
ration of the operating systems, user accounts, and data.
After completing the following sections, you will meet these objectives:
■Describe the configuration of operation system updates
■Maintain accounts
■Explain data backup procedures, access to backups, and secure physical backup media
Describe the Configuration of Operating System
Updates
An operating system is a likely target of attack because obtaining control of it can provide
control of the computer. Then the compromised computer can be seized and put to work by
the criminals. One popular use is to turn targeted computers into spam generators that
launch attacking e-mails without the user being able to stop them. A computer compro-
mised in this way is called a zombie.
Windows XP automatically downloads and installs updates to operating systems by default.
However, this might not be the best way to update systems. The updates might conflict with
the security policy of an organization or might conflict with other settings on a computer.
Furthermore, a network administrator might want to test the updates before the updates are
distributed to all the network computers. The following Windows XP options give users the
ability to control when software is updated:
■Automatic: Downloads and installs updates automatically without user intervention
■Only download updates: Downloads the updates automatically, but the user is
required to install them
■Notify me: Notifies the user that updates are available and gives the option to down-
load and install
■Turn off automatic updates: Prevents any checking for updates
If the user is on a dial-up network, the Windows Update setting should be configured to
notify the user of available updates, or it should be turned off. The dialup user might want
to control the update by selecting a time when the update does not interrupt other network
activity or use the limited resources available. 
18
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Maintain Accounts
Employees in an organization can require different levels of access to data. For example, a
manager and an accountant might be the only employees in an organization with access to
the payroll files.
Employees can be grouped by job requirements and given access to files according to group
permissions. This process helps manage employee access to the network. Temporary
accounts can be set up for employees that need short-term access. Close management of
network access can help to limit areas of vulnerability that allow a virus or malicious soft-
ware to enter the network.
Terminating Employee Access
When an employee leaves an organization, access to data and hardware on the network
should be terminated immediately. If the former employee has stored files in a personal
space on a server, eliminate access by disabling the account. At a later time, if the employ-
ee’s replacement requires access to the applications and storage space, reenable the account
and change its name to the name of the new employee.
Guest Accounts
Temporary employees and guests might need access to the network. For example, many vis-
itors require access to e-mail, the Internet, and a printer on the network. These resources
can all be made available to a special account called Guest. When guests are present, they
can be assigned to the guest account. When no guests are present, the account can be sus-
pended until the next guest arrives. 
Some guest accounts can require extensive access to resources, as in the case of a consult-
ant or a financial auditor. This type of access should be granted only for the period of time
required to complete the work.
Explain Data Backup Procedures, Access to Backups,
and Secure Physical Backup Media
A data backup stores a copy of the information on a computer to removable backup media
that can be kept in a safe place. If the computer hardware fails, the data backup can be
restored so that processing can continue.
Data backups should be performed on a regular basis. The most current data backup is usu-
ally stored off-site to protect the backup media if anything happens to the main facility.
Backup media is often reused to save on media costs. Always follow your organization’s
media rotation guidelines.
Backup operations can be performed at the command line or from a batch file using the
NTBACKUP command. The default parameters for NTBACKUP will be the ones set in
Chapter 16: Advanced Security
19

the Windows backup utility. Any options you want to override must be included at the com-
mand line. The NTBACKUP command cannot be used to restore files.
A combination of backup types, as shown in Table 16-2, allow the data to be backed up
efficiently. A full or normal backup is a copy of all files on the drive. An incremental back-
up backs up only those files created or changed since the last normal or incremental back-
up. An archive bit marks files as having been backed up. A differential backup copies files
created or changed since the last normal or incremental backup, but it does not mark files as
having been backed up. Backing up data can take time, so it is preferable to do backups
when the network traffic is low. Other types of backups include daily backup and copy
backup, which do not mark the files as having been backed up.
Table 16-2
Backup Types

Archives all selected files and resets the archive bit

mental backup
Differential
Archives all selected files that have changed since the last full
backup
Daily
Archives all selected files that have changed on the day of the
backup
Copy

The data backup media is just as important as the data on the computer. You should store
the backup media in a climate-controlled off-site storage facility with adequate physical
security. The backups should be readily available for access in case of an emergency. 
Troubleshoot Security
The troubleshooting process is used to help resolve security issues. These problems range
from simple, such as creating a backup, to more complex, such as a firewall configuration.
Follow the steps outlined in the following sections to accurately identify, repair, and docu-
ment the problem:
Step 1.
Gather data from the customer.
Step 2.
Verify the obvious issues.
Step 3.
Try quick solutions first.
Step 4.

Review the Troubleshooting Process
Computer technicians must be able to analyze a security threat and determine the appropri-
ate method to protect assets and repair damage. This process is called troubleshooting.
Step 1: Gather Data from the Customer
The first step in the troubleshooting process is to gather data from the customer. Table 16-3
provides a list of open-ended and closed-ended questions to ask the customer about security
threats. (This list is not comprehensive.)

Do you back up your computer?
Do you have permissions for the resource?
Chapter 16: Advanced Security
21

Step 2: Verify the Obvious Issues
After you have talked to the customer, you should verify the obvious issues:
■Does the access point appear to be on?
■Does anyone else have this problem?
■Have you been able to connect to the Internet since the wireless router was upgraded?
■Does this problem occur only at your desk or at other areas of the office as well?
■Have you been able to connect through wireless at any other locations?
■Is the Automatic Updates feature turned on?
■Is the firewall configured properly?
Step 3: Try Quick Solutions First
After the obvious issues have been verified, try some quick solutions. Some quick solutions
to laptop problems include
■Check the wireless signal strength at different locations in the area.
■Attempt to connect to the access point with security temporarily turned off to see
whether a security setting is the problem.
■Log off and then back on.
■Reboot the device.
■Verify permissions on a resource.
■Run an antivirus scan or a spyware scan.
Step 4: Gather Data from the Computer
If quick solutions did not correct the problem, it is time to gather data from the computer.
Some different ways to gather information about the problem from the laptop include
■Check firewall logs.
■Check Task Manager.
■Check dates on virus definitions.
■Check permissions.
■Check account type.
■Check with your system administrator.
■Verify that the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys are not on.
22
IT Essentials: PC Harware and Software Companion Guide

Step 5: Evaluate the Problem and Implement the Solution
At this point, you will have enough information to evaluate the problem and research and
implement possible solutions. Some resources for possible solutions include
■Problem-solving experience
■Other technicians
■Internet search
■Newsgroups
■Manufacturer FAQs
■Computer manuals
■Device manuals
■Online forums
■Technical websites
Step 6: Close with the Customer
After you have solved the problem, you will close with the customer. Closing with the cus-
tomer usually includes the following:
■Discuss the solution implemented with the customer.
■Have customer verify that the problem has been solved.
■Provide the customer with all paperwork.
■Document steps taken to solved the problem in the work order and the technician’s
journal.
■Document any components used in the repair.
■Document the time spent to resolve the problem. 
Identify Common Problems and Solutions
Security problems can be attributed to hardware, software, networks, or some combination
of the three. You will resolve some types of security problems more often than others. Table
