Introduction
Welcome to web analytics!
The purpose of this book is to provide a simple, focused introduction to web 
analytics, and Google Analytics specifically. It’s geared toward employees who 
may be working at a company or non-profit organization, for students at a 
university, or for self-paced learners. The approach is the same one that I’ve 
taken in most of my books, which is conversational, friendly, with an attempt 
at making things fun.
The experiment is to find a way to help people get started with digital  
marketing in a way that is fun and helps build skills—maybe through an internship,  
paid work, volunteer work, freelance work, or any other type of work. The 
focus is on skills and approaches that can be immediately useful to a business 
or non-profit organization. I’m not going to try to cover everything, but just 
the things that I think are the most helpful.
The other goal is to help you leave any intimidation you have in the dust.  
I used to be intimidated by marketing, and now look at me. I’m a marketing  
strategist and an assistant professor of marketing! But I remember the feeling 
of intimidation, so part of my approach is to encourage any reader who may 
feel uncertain about the field.
The fact is that web analytics has a lot of options, and there’s a lot of material 
out there. It can be overwhelming! But it can also be very doable, if you leave 
intimidation in the dust, take incremental steps, try things out, and build your 
confidence.
For example, I had a friend who used to be a journalist, and he was looking 
for new career opportunities. I helped get him started in digital marketing, and 
one of the first things he ran into was feeling overwhelmed by all the options, 
including all the articles about all the options. “There are so many tools out 
there!,” he used to say, “How am I ever going to learn all of them?!?”
The answer is that you don’t need to learn all of them. No one can. The thing 
to do is focus on trying some of the tools and skills and go on from there. 
I encouraged my friend not to worry about trying to learn everything, but 
instead to just learn some basics.
The friend worked with the basics, gained experience, and was able to find a 
local agency that gave him a shot at doing some freelance work. The career 
didn’t easily develop for him—he had to put effort into it. But a few years later,

he’s doing full-time freelance work in digital marketing. He was able to leave 
intimidation in the dust, and I believe he’s also had some fun with it too.
LinkedIn showed digital/online marketing as a top skill that got people hired in 
2013/2014, and web analytics is one of the core skills for online marketing—
this includes being able to understand the performance of web sites and ad 
campaigns. Analytics is considered a part of business intelligence, which also 
figures prominently on the list:
Each year the way they refer to digital marketing seems to change, but since 
2013, digital marketing (of which analytics is a core part) has been at the top. 
Demand will fluctuate over time, but we are talking about the top skills in any 
field that get people hired.

One of the other things I’ve seen in my career, which I try to reinforce in these 
books and in my classes, is the way that the core areas of digital marketing are 
related. For example, I consider web analytics to be tightly connected to all 
other areas in digital marketing. Content is key in digital marketing, as you’ll 
learn if you read my book Introduction to Search Engine Optimization (Apress, 
2017), and advertising campaigns on search engines (AdWords) and social 
media take content and put it out there.

Introduction
xiii
At the end of the day, you need analytics to measure the performance. That 
makes it super important.
This book mentions what I call the core areas of digital marketing: Content, 
AdWords, Social, and Analytics (CASA for short). My goal is to reinforce how 
all the areas are connected. AdWords is Google’s tool for creating ads for 
search engine marketing. The inspiration came from my professional back-
ground, as well as looking at trends in the marketplace.
Best wishes in learning web analytics and Google Analytics!

C H A P T E R 
Overview
This chapter takes a look at what analytics is and introduces related concepts. 
This chapter, and the entire book, is oriented toward beginners. My goal is to 
encourage you to consider learning more about analytics, including using a 
tool called Google Analytics, and to see if I convince you that it actually is fun.
Web analytics is becoming increasingly important to online marketers, as they 
seek to track return on investment (ROI) and optimize their web sites. We’ll 
learn about Google Analytics, starting with creating a blog and monitoring the 
number of people who see the blog posts and determining where they come 
from.
Don’t Be Alarmed: Analytics Can Be Fun
So I remember when I started working in various jobs after college, that one 
thing I knew for certain is that I didn’t feel like I was a “numbers” person. 
Accounting, finance, or any other type of numbers always seemed foreboding, 
and outside my experience and comfort zone. It was the last possible door I 
wanted to walk through, and to get me through it, you’d have to drag me.

Chapter 1 | Overview

But the interesting thing was that I got my first taste of analytics without even 
realizing it.
I created a web site with a friend, and we wanted to know how many people 
were visiting it and where they were coming from, so we searched for a tool 
that would help us with that. That tool became a part of our toolbox.
It was fun. Getting to see who was coming, what the traffic was like, was really 
interesting.
Then, in later work experiences, including some where there had been 
transition in the companies I worked for, including layoffs, I became more 
sensitive to how these roles related to the overall business.

Introduction to Google Analytics

At one point, a mentor gave me some advice that really helped me. She was 
experienced and she said to me, “Todd, you need to follow the money trail”.
She wasn’t saying, “bow down to money.” She was just saying, it’s good to 
understand how money flows through a business—what makes money and 
what costs a business money.
My perspective on money and finance was challenged, and I realized that it 
would probably be a good idea to consider not just what I felt like doing, but 
what would be a benefit to a business or organization—especially during hard 
times, such as a recession, or competition, etc. I also started to understand 
that the kinds of skills and roles that had a direct impact on helping a company 
succeed were in high demand.
This path led me to pay more attention to online marketing in particular, as 
well as social networking to a particular degree. In the midst of hard economic 
times, Google was increasing in value, at a time when many or even most 
companies were having serious financial issues. It was partly because Google 
was helping companies do a good job of tracking ROI with Google ads—
AdWords. AdWords helps businesses know what they are making based on 
what they are spending in terms of online ads.
As I grew and matured, I also realized that web analytics was an important 
skill and I started learning more about it. It helped me find work and be 
competitive.
While I’m still not “passionate” about numbers, I do see things like Google 
Analytics as an important tool. Maybe I’m more in touch with my inner analyst.
My recommendation is, seriously consider learning web analytics, in order to 
strengthen your career. It won’t hurt, and it can also be fun.
Another thing I suggest with web analytics in particular, and in any situation 
where you are dealing with numbers based on purchases, is to remember this 
aphorism. It may look like a bunch of numbers:

Chapter 1 | Overview

But it’s really not about the numbers, in the end. It’s about the people:
Personal ROI: How Analytics Will Help Your 
Career and Your Organization
Learning analytics can have a significant impact on your career, regardless of 
the area of digital marketing you work in.
Social Media Marketing
It’s increasingly important for social media marketers to understand how to 
measure and optimize the performance of campaigns—you might call this 
“social analytics”. If you haven’t read my Introduction to Social Media book yet, 
you might want to have a look. It includes some coverage of social analytics. 
You could also work your way through this book and then head on over to 
that one, to see the connections.
Digital/Online Marketing
The goal of digital marketing is often to sell something, or at least to get 
people to visit and sign up for something. So web analytics is a crucial tool for 
monitoring how your efforts are going.

Introduction to Google Analytics

Business Intelligence
You could think of this as “advanced analytics”. Business intelligence might 
include web analytics (reviewing the performance of your web site and 
associated marketing), but it can also extend into other areas, such as 
“competitive intelligence,” by using a tool like compete.com or just looking at 
financial trends. In my own experience, starting out with web analytics helped 
me understand how online marketing and reports fit into overall business 
intelligence. It would be fair to say that business intelligence is ROI.
You don’t need any skills to start off, and you don’t need to be a numbers 
person. This book is for anyone who wants to get a job in online marketing 
or who wants to learn how the performance of their web sites fits into the 
business model. Google Analytics is one of the top tools, and web analytics 
can be a competitive differentiator in the job market, whether it’s one part of 
a skillset or a dedicated role.
■
■Note  This book is intended to help students to view web analytics info and learn how to 
develop insights. Skills in this area connect to other areas, such as search engine marketing and 
social media marketing, and provide a network effect to help students become more effective 
online marketers, as well as more employable.
Here’s a suggestion and invitation, for your “personal” ROI, that I want you to 
consider—become Google Analytics qualified. This book is an introduction 
to the concepts and the tool, and then I’ll point you to more learning material 
that Google has, which you might want to pursue in order to get qualified. See 
Chapter 8 for more details.
Basically, having this qualification on your resume or LinkedIn profile will help 
to show your credibility, to your colleagues and potential employers. In short, 
it will help your career.

Chapter 1 | Overview
6
Some certifications cost thousands of dollars to prepare for, and the tests can 
be expensive too—however, at the time of writing, Google qualification is free.
Organizational ROI
I don’t know if “organizational return on investment” is really a term, but I 
guess now it is.
What I mean is that even if you already have a job somewhere, going for 
Google qualification can help any company or organization you are a part of. 
Not only will it help with your credibility when people interact with you on 
sites like LinkedIn, but it will also help you think more about tracking ROI. It’s 
a mindset that will be a benefit to any business, to help you make good choices 
about which direction to go in.
Free and Corporate Tools
There are a variety of web analytics tools out there, which people use on a 
free and paid basis. For grins, try going on LinkedIn and doing a job search for 
“web analytics” to see what comes up. Chances are that one or more of these 
programs will be mentioned.
Google Analytics
Google Analytics is free, and it is always increasing in power, to rival and in 
some cases exceed the performance of the “paid” tools. For example, you’ll 
often see companies using a combination of Google Analytics and paid tools. 
Google Analytics can’t do everything, but it’s a good place to start.
Adobe Analytics: Omniture
Adobe Analytics/Omniture has long been considered one of the top 
“enterprise” web analytics tools. It has a lot of power, sophistication, and 
customization. There are things that Omniture can do that Google Analytics 
can’t, and vice versa. Knowledge of this program can definitely help you get 
a job or a higher salary. It’s a somewhat chicken and egg situation. It’s an 
expensive program, with no trial version at the time of this writing, so few 
people know how to use it well. Hence, it is harder to find people with this 
skill; therefore, the demand (and salary) can be higher.
If you are going into online marketing and you can find a company to intern 
at or work with where you have the opportunity to learn Omniture/Adobe 
Analytics, that could be a good opportunity.

Introduction to Google Analytics
7
More recently, larger companies have been consolidating smaller companies 
and developing integrated “marketing clouds,” so you should look at some 
of the tools that Adobe Analytics is connected with. See www.adobe.com/
analytics.
Other “enterprise” options include tools like WebTrends. Hopefully at some 
point enterprise folks will wise up and offer trial versions to help people get 
access and learn to use them.
Open Source Analytics
For people who are interested in completely controlling their own data, open 
source analytics programs may be an option. In certain cases, they may allow 
you to have the functionality you need, without giving up any of the value. 
For example, most people and companies accept the value proposition when 
using a Gmail address, doing a Google search, or using Google Analytics. They 
know that Google will analyze the data and make money off of it. In other 
words, when you search for something, Google might display an ad based on 
your behavior, which you might be interested in.
Google isn’t in the business of selling your contact information, per se, but 
with analytics, it might gather your information, make it anonymous, and group 
it with a lot of other data, with the goal of making money off of it. Google can 
also somehow use related “cookie” information.
Google isn’t doing anything illegal, and personally, I don’t think there’s anything 
to worry about. But you might be interested to just take a peek at some of 
the open source options out there, in case you end up being more concerned 
about the data someday, or you end up with a client or employer who is. 
There are some more value propositions on their sites.
See http://piwik.org and http://www.openwebanalytics.com/.
As for me, and many thousands of businesses, I’m cool with Google Analytics.
Social Analytics
Social analytics is an area in which particular social media channels, such as 
Facebook, YouTube, etc., allow you to get information about how your social 
media efforts are working. You can determine the number of people who like 
your page, follow you, or talk about you— that kind of thing. There aren’t any 
dominating “all in one” social analytics tools as of yet, but take a look at Adobe’s 
“social analytics” offering, to see an example of an attempt to become one.
In general, the social analytics tools are free and built into social media. In 
some cases, there are low cost tools like Hootsuite (which also has a free 
version) that will draw some of the material together for you.

Chapter 1 | Overview
8
If any of that sounds interesting, take a look at my book entitled Introduction to 
Social Media Marketing (Apress, 2017).
My general advice for beginners is to have some fun learning Google Analytics 
and also try a bit of social media marketing. Get your feet wet with social 
analytics.
Things Change
As you explore these areas, be prepared for things to change, but don’t worry. 
You don’t need to learn every tool. I recommend taking an incremental, 
gradual approach.
As with social media marketing, there are a lot of options out there, and if your 
eyes start to glaze over with the mention of all these analytics tools, don’t be 
alarmed! Don’t try to learn them abstractly—try them out. I’ll introduce them 
to you in a way that is fun.
Search Drill
If you’re just getting acquainted, I suggest doing a few Google searches to see 
what’s out there and reading anything that looks interesting:
• 
YouTube Google Analytics intro
• 
Learning Google Analytics
• 
Understanding web analytics YouTube
•

Conclusion
Congratulations on making it through this chapter! I’m trying to make the 
approach in this book as friendly and relevant as possible, based on the 
intimidation I used to feel. Feel free to let me know if it’s working, if you feel 
like you’re still intimidated, or if you feel like it’s “too fluffy”. Best wishes in 
learning analytics!

Blogalytics
This chapter is a basic recipe to get started in analytics, to take the first step in 
being able to track web traffic and see what’s happening. You’ll create a simple 
blog, start a Google Analytics account, connect the two, and discuss things 
along the way. The goal is to make a simple, relevant way to start exploring 
analytics.
Create a Google Account/Gmail Address
Google has a lot of free tools that make it easier to work with content, and 
when you have a Google account, it just makes it easier to sign in to all the tools.
As a first step, I recommend creating a free Google account by going to 
http://mail.google.com and clicking Create Account.
Start a Blog
To get started, visit http://www.blogger.com and either sign in with your 
Google account or click the Create an Account link at the bottom of the page.
2

Chapter 2 | Blogalytics
10
Then on the blogger site, click the New Blog button.
For practice, I wouldn’t be too concerned with the title. You can change it 
later easily, and you can also create/delete blogs easily. Feel free to try “Social 
Media Perspective” as a title.
The title is simply what appears visually at the top of the blog. The Address 
is the opportunity Google gives you to have a custom address. Because it’s a 
free tool, you might have to experiment a bit until you find one that’s available. 
Type in ideas in the Address field and see what happens:

Introduction to Google Analytics
11
What you’re doing is coming up with the custom portion of the blog address.
It turns out for our example, the address socialbuzznews.blogspot.
com is available. The link for this blog would be http://socialbuzznews.
blogspot.com.
■
■Tip  You’ll want to make a note of this link to your blog, so you can use it when you start a 
Google Analytics account later in this chapter.
After you choose a title and address, you can choose a template for the look 
and feel of the blog. You can also change the template later:

Chapter 2 | Blogalytics
12
After you select one (I recommend starting with Simple), click the Create 
Blog! button.
With these simple steps, you’ve created a blog and can start blogging!
Your mission if you should choose to accept it is to make a sample post, and 
then share the link on Facebook or via e-mail with someone.
■
■Note  One way to “cheat” if you forget the link for your blog is to click on the View blog button 
(see the screenshot above), which will open the blog in your browser. Then you can copy the link 
from the Address field and paste it into Facebook or into an e-mail, etc.
To learn more about Blogger, access the settings menu (the little gear icon) 
when you’re signed int o Blogger and select Blogger Help:
There are a variety of helpful articles:
You can always go directly to help with this link: https://support.google.
com/blogger.

Introduction to Google Analytics
13
Start a Google Analytics Account
The next step is to create a Google Analytics account, which you do by going 
to http://www.google.com/analytics/.
If you’re already signed into Gmail/Google, you’ll see an Access Google 
Analytics button:
Otherwise, you can click Sign In and sign in with your Gmail/Google account, 
or click Create an Account:
That’s the sign-in process. Once you’re signed in as a Google user, you should 
get a page like this one, where you can click the Sign Up button to create your 
Google Analytics account:

Chapter 2 | Blogalytics
14
Google Analytics defaults to creating an account around web sites, but if you’re 
interested in mobile marketing, at some point you might like to explore the 
idea of developing an app and integrating Google Analytics directly in the app.
To begin, type an account name—it could be your name, the name of your 
organization, or something like Learning Analytics. It really doesn’t matter at 
this point:
Next, you set up a property. Whenever you add a new site or blog for Google 
Analytics to track, it’s considered a property. This is where you paste in your 
blog’s address, if you’re following along:

Introduction to Google Analytics
15
Then click Get Tracking ID:
Tracking IDs are basically codes that Google gives you to place on your site or 
blog, so that the site can “talk” to Google. The ID is unique for every site/blog 
you set up. It’s a one-time, thing, and you end up taking it back to your site, in 
order to set up the connection.
Next, click the I Accept button at the bottom of the agreement. You might 
need to roll your mouse over the top of this window until it becomes four 
arrows, and then click and drag it up, in order to see the I Accept button.
Then, Google Analytics should open with a page, based on the name you gave 
to your site or blog:

Chapter 2 | Blogalytics
16
You can scroll down until you see the Tracking ID (it’s UA-53515736-1 shown 
here):
Then just select it, right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac), and choose 
copy:

Introduction to Google Analytics
17
Even if you copy this code into memory (for pasting into Blogger), I recommend 
making a note of it somewhere.
Connect Google Analytics to Blogger
Now that you’ve created a Google Analytics account and generated a tracking 
code, you can go back to your blog and click Settings:

Chapter 2 | Blogalytics
18
Under Settings, click Other:
Find the section that says Google Analytics:
Paste that marvelous tracking code you copied before (from your site or blog):
Into the Analytics Web Property ID field:
Then click Save Settings:

Introduction to Google Analytics
19
Looking at Google Analytics
In theory, Google Analytics should now be connected. It can take 24 hours for 
anything to happen, but in the meantime, I suggest making a post on your blog 
and sharing it with friends on Facebook as a test.
All you really need at this point is a few clicks on your blog, just to test things 
out a bit.
In order to see how things are going, go to http://www.google.com/ana-

You should see a section on your Google Analytics page. It’s based on how 
you named your Google Analytics account, including the name of your site, 
and finally a little globe icon with your site:

At a very basic level, what programs like Google Analytics seek to give you is 
a sense of your web site’s performance—that is, how many people visit, and 
their behavior on the site.
Using a simple example like this is a good place to start, and ultimately what 
most web analytics tools help you do is track revenue or goals, such as people 
visiting and then purchasing or signing up for something.
To scratch the surface, after you generate data over time, one feature to keep 
in mind about analytics programs is the way you set a date range.
In Google Analytics, you can click on the arrow to the right of the “default” 
date:
Then you can choose from several options:
You can regularly look at Google Analytics and review how things are going 
on a consistent basis. With analytics, you are often looking back and looking 
for trends. Are visits increasing? Did a particular campaign increase traffic? 
Things like this.

When you set a new date range, you need to click Apply:
Don’t be afraid to review other sections in Google Analytics on the left side. 
In some cases, you need to be gathering data for a while for these sections to 
generate meaningful information. It’s interesting at this point to note the kinds 
of things you can track:

Conclusion
Congratulations on setting things up!
I think the reason analytics can be fun is that you can see “under the hood” of 
a web site and look at how many people are visiting. If you’ve used Facebook, 
it’s similar to seeing how many people like your post or page. But analytics 
takes it from a single item to a fuller picture of what’s going on.
In order to have fun, the next step is to get some traffic to your blog or site. 
One thing you can do is write a blog post and share it wherever you can think 
of to get some clicks, including Facebook.
Consider regularly blogging on your exploration of online marketing and 
analytics, such as making a blog post once a week, to see what it’s like to 
get traffic over time. Feel free to read Introduction to Social Media Marketing 
(Apress, 2017) to learn more.
In the next chapter, you’ll try two related techniques to “jump start” things 
and get some traffic to analyze in Google Analytics.

Getting Traffic 
for Analytics
This chapter looks at a couple of basic techniques for generating traffic on a 
blog or web site, following the previous chapter about creating a blog. The 
chapters are written as self-contained experiments. Ultimately, you need traf-
fic in order to be able to look at analytics, so this chapter describes a few ways 
to generate traffic.
Basic Social Media Promotion
One of the easiest ways to get some test traffic to your blog or web site is by 
sharing a link to a post on any social media accounts you have. (If you don’t 
have any, I suggest signing up for Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn).
If you want more connections, you can always use the feature where you 
share your e-mail contact list, and the programs suggest new connections. 
Check out these sites for good advice:

“How to import contacts into Linkedin:  https://

query=import%20contacts%20into%20linkedin
Once you have some connections to work with, the next step is to take the 
link for your blog and post an invitation to social media. This isn’t about social 
media promotion per se—this is just an exercise to generate traffic, for the 
purpose of being able to look at your analytics data.
Get the Link
Go to the blog you created in Chapter 2 and copy the link into memory.
For this blog, the “general” link is http://npoex.blogspot.com/.
There’s a difference between the blog link and a link to individual blog posts. 
Click on the title of a blog post you made, and you’ll see a longer link. This is 
the one you’ll want to share on social media:

■
■Tip  Visuals are good. Include a picture in the blog post. When you post to social, to get more 
notice, include a picture in your post. Technically you could post a photo to Facebook, and include 
a link in the post, but what you really want to do is include visuals in your original blog post. Then 
when you post to social media, in some cases (Facebook/LinkedIn), it gives you the option of 
having a visual preview. This will garner more attention, more clicks, and ultimately more data to 
play with.
Make your blog posts ongoing. For learning analytics, I recommend that you get in the habit of 
posting once a week to a blog (or web site) that is connected to Google Analytics, and then look 
back at it. To generate ongoing data, add the Follow by Email feature in Blogger. When people visit, 
they can sign up to get posts automatically when you post them. In theory, this should help you get 
some ongoing clicks.
Make Your Pitch
This chapter isn’t meant to replace my Introduction to Social Media Marketing 
book. I recommend you read that too, because it’s all connected. But we’re just 
taking a simple, quick tour of how to get some clicks.
So when you post to social, make a pitch for clicks. Tell people what you’re up 
to and invite them to click on the link below. Something like this:
Friends and colleagues, please click on this link. I’m doing a test for a book 
I’m writing to help people learn web analytics, in order to show readers 
how they can share their blog posts on social media. Every click will help 
generate some “data” that I can look at in the book. You’re also welcome 
to subscribe by e-mail if you’re interested in the topic. (Please feel free to 
pass this along.)

Post It to Social Media
Put your post on social media. Notice how Facebook picked up the image 
from the blog post in the preview.
You may not realize that you can do the same thing on LinkedIn.
When you log in, there should be a spot to share an update:
It’s worth trying.

Introduction to Google Analytics
27
Promote Your Post
I get kind of an icky feeling even sharing this technique, but it’s built into 
Facebook, and it feels a bit like a mafia shakedown. See Introduction to Social 
Media Marketing (Apress, 2017) for my skeptical perspective on how advertising 
on Facebook has evolved.
Whether it is because there are too many posts by too many people, or 
whether Facebook has intentionally limited who sees your posts, the bottom 
line is that not as many people will see your posts on your personal profile as 
in the past, unless you pay Facebook to promote them.
The quickest, easiest way to get your posts noticed is to click the Promote 
link at the bottom of the post and pay the Facebook mafia:

Chapter 3 | Getting Traffic for Analytics
28
This extortion is probably worth the money, at least as a learning experience:
Enter your credit card information and click Pay to Promote:

Introduction to Google Analytics
29
It’s a one-time, limited thing. A bit like blackmail. Blackmail payments have a 
way of growing, and not going away. So too with social networks’ interest in 
monetizing everything—even if you had the impression that it shouldn’t cost 
anything to share with the network of friends you built. I suppose Facebook 
provided the platform to build that network, but still. But for grins, lets give 
Facebook the benefit of the doubt. Personal social advertising is just like pro-
fessional social advertising. You pay to get exposure.
Wait, isn’t social media supposed to be “free” advertising?
At any rate, when you pay Facebook to promote your post, it shows the word 
“Sponsored” at the bottom:

Chapter 3 | Getting Traffic for Analytics
30
::Shudders::
Make an Ad
Another way I suggest trying to add more clicks is a simple Facebook ad 
campaign. As much as Facebook ads have changed as Facebook has grown, it’s 
still probably easier to create a Facebook ad than a Google ad, for example. 
Although I should probably take a poll on that, from people who have tried 
both.
So we’re just going to take the simplest way possible through the process, 
without getting into specifics. It’s all about the data.
Go to https://www.facebook.com/ads/create and click on the Clicks to 
Website option:
Then, copy your trusty blog link, the one to the specific post, and paste it in 
the field:

Introduction to Google Analytics
31
Until/unless Facebook changes, when you paste the link, it may flip you to 
another screen. Don’t be alarmed.
On the next screen, you’ll want to upload an image. It recommends a large 
image, and if you try to run the ad with a smaller image (like the one show 
here that Facebook picked up from the blog post), it won’t run the ad. If you’re 
just testing things, search for “Earth” on Google. Click the image link at the 
top of the Google page, right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac), and then 
save the image to disk. You can use this image.

Chapter 3 | Getting Traffic for Analytics
32
■
■Tip  If you’re enjoying this detour on the way to analytics bliss, Chapter 2 of my Introduction to 
Social Media Marketing book covers a few basic tools for working with content, including images, 
and source of images.
When I tried a slightly larger image, it still didn’t work:
In the end, I just grabbed that “Earth” image, which was 300x300, and that 
worked.
After you have an image in place, type in a headline and text for the ad. It’s 
an art and a science, but just put in something short and direct with a call to 
action. The little numbers on the right tell you how many characters you have 
left to type in. There are limits.

Introduction to Google Analytics
33
Next, you pick an audience. You could send it to completely random people, 
but you’ll end up with more clicks if you indicate some interests.
Try clicking in the Interests field and typing in an interest, such as “social media 
marketing”, “web analytics”, or whatever your blog is about. If you don’t have 
a topic, make it about online marketing, read all the free books, and keep 
posting!
As you type, options will come up and you can click on them:

Chapter 3 | Getting Traffic for Analytics

Narrow things down a bit and then review the budget at the bottom:
If you want to limit your investment, you can click on Per Day and switch to 
a lifetime budget.
Then click on Place Order:

Introduction to Google Analytics
35
If you get a message like this, you might need to upload a new image:
(You might need to click on the “X” by any image you uploaded that isn’t large 
enough. You can use multiple images to see which generates the best clicks.)
You should get a confirmation, and you can click Continue:

this link: https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage.
(If you want to know more about Facebook ads, check out my Introduction to 
Social Media Marketing book).

Chapter 3 | Getting Traffic for Analytics
36
The overall point is that a Facebook ad may generate more clicks and attention 
than your personal social posts. The more clicks, the more data you have for 
this learning experience. All the better.
And if you plan on running a month-long or quarter-long experience (Q1, Q2, 
etc.—three months), or even a semester-long experience, you can always set a 
monthly budget and an end date, and just let the thing run. If you do something 
like that, be sure to blog regularly, such as once a week. Follow the tips to add 
“Follow by Email”. See how things go. In some cases, web analytics is a job 
unto itself, but it’s fair to say that in many cases it’s a skill anyone can learn, 
including people who are responsible for getting the traffic in the first place.

Conclusion
Congratulations on exploring how to generate analytics! It’s important to 
set these things in motion, partly because having real, live data is more fun 
than just looking at a screenshot. Next up, we’ll look at how to review 
performance.

Reviewing 
Performance of 
Campaigns
This chapter takes a look at some of the ways you can track the performance 
of a web site or campaign, as well as some related terms, and covers the idea 
of ongoing reporting. If you’re following along in text only, you can pick up 
some information just from reading the material. However, I think it is more 
compelling if you develop a blog or site as discussed in Chapters 1-3, so that 
you have your own personal data to look at. It’s more exciting, and even fun!
Reviewing Campaign Analytics
Even though our focus is on Google Analytics, I think it’s worth seeing how 
tools relate. In the previous chapter, we looked at how to generate some 
traffic for viewing in analytics, and this would be representative of if you were 
doing an ad campaign and looking at its impact. In many cases, you could be 
involved in the execution of an ad campaign, as well as looking at the data.
It’s also helpful to see how an ad platform views things, versus how things look 
on your actual web site or blog.

Chapter 4 | Reviewing Performance of Campaigns
38
In other words, the clicks from an ad don’t tell the whole story. Without 
looking at Google Analytics, you can get some sense of the amount of traffic 
you’ll get, but you won’t really know what to do with it. It’s like sending 
someone to a house but not knowing what they do once they get there.
If you’re following along and have tried a Facebook ad campaign, you can go 
to Facebook to see how things are going: https://www.facebook.com/ads/
manage
At this end, you’re seeing the “outgoing” information—people on Facebook 
who see your ad. Hopefully some of them click on it and visit your blog or 
web site:
If you tried the promoted post idea, you can go back to it and click on the 
Sponsored link. At present, Facebook doesn’t give good data on personal 
sponsored posts. (Is this because it’s in their best interest not to give num-
bers?) All they give you is a relative picture:
Okay, so how many people actually clicked on the link in the Sponsored post? 
This is one limitation of the “personal promotion” platform—limited data. 
When you run Facebook ads (or sponsored posts from a Facebook page, 
etc.), you get a bit more data.

Introduction to Google Analytics
39
Ultimately, you can look at Google Analytics to see how many clicks arrived 
from various sources.
Reviewing Performance in Google Analytics
So let’s go back into Google Analytics (assuming everything is set up, you’re 
tracking visitors, you shared on social media and/or ran an ad, etc.):
Go to http://www.google.com/analytics/. You should see something like 
this, where you click on the link next to the little globe:
Google Analytics has a lot of options—a lot of ways to “slice and dice”—but 
my recommendation is to approach it pragmatically. You don’t have to know 
and use every option from day one. Instead, you can start by answering a 
specific question and branch out from there.
The fun part at this stage is seeing that there are in fact visitors to your site.
The Overview tab will open, and by default it will look back at recent data, 
based on Sessions:
A session is a technical term for a visit, and the thing to keep in mind is that 
people often view several pages during a visit.

Chapter 4 | Reviewing Performance of Campaigns
40
On the same page, there will be several additional items:
While there might be 15 sessions, there were 17 page views. This means that 
some of the visitors viewed more than one page during their visit.
Another interesting metric is the amount of time on average users spent 
during their visit. In this case, the average was 8 seconds.
One of the ways that people use information from Google Analytics is to 
view how performance currently is, and then set goals for the future. For 
example, a goal might be to look at the site or blog and see if you can add 
more compelling content, so that over time, the average duration of a session 
increases.
Bounce rate is a similar metric. The bounce rate represents the number of 
visitors who enter the site and then leave (or “bounce”), rather than continuing 
to view other pages on the same site. Another goal of reviewing performance 
and optimization might be to take note of the bounce rate, and see what you 
can do to decrease it.
What might be some reasons people “bounce”? A good Google search drill 
might be to search for “improving bounce rate” or “why do people bounce 
from a site”?
Location, Location, Location!
Another thing I think is particularly fun to do is to determine where people 
are visiting from. In Google Analytics, on the left, click on Geo:

Introduction to Google Analytics
41
Then click on Location:
There is a map overlay, and it will give you an instant visual sense of where 
your visitors are coming from:

Chapter 4 | Reviewing Performance of Campaigns
42
Then there is also a breakdown of which sessions were from which areas:
For example, I’m not entirely sure why there was a visitor from Cyprus, but they 
didn’t appear to stay on the site too long (and average session duration of 0).
Using Campaigns and Ongoing Blog Posts
With analytics, it’s probably fair to say that the best way to learn the value, 
and learn how to optimize, is alongside an ongoing campaign of some kind, 
and/or a web site that has an ongoing set of visitors. If you’re just starting out, 
exploring and playing with some of the options in Google Analytics can teach 
you a few tools that you can keep in mind for when you’re in that situation. 
I personally believe that making an ongoing blog is a good general learning 
experience, as well as a source of traffic.
Dare I say that you can think of analytics as a party? Invite people from all 
over the world, give them something enjoyable, meaningful, or relevant to 
experience, and then see what they do. That’s analytics!
Looking at Trends
One concept in analytics that’s helpful to explore, file away, and burn into 
your synapses is the idea of trending. It basically means looking at how things 
perform over time. You look at the trends. An easy way to get a sense of 
trending is to go directly into Blogger and click on the Stats link. You’ll see a 
simplified set of analytics.

Introduction to Google Analytics
43
So the 2069.us blog has been around for a while. It is a personal blog that 
hasn’t been promoted extensively, but has seen some traffic.
The Stats function in Blogger opens up to the Week tab:
If you click in the All Time tab (upper right), it shows a longer view, and the 
longer your blog has been around, the more you can see trends. In theory, 
with a consistent application of effort (adding quality content, making some 
effort to promote, getting listed on some other sites), you will see a boost in 
the amount of traffic.

Chapter 4 | Reviewing Performance of Campaigns
44
On the left, since 2006 that is, we see that there has been a fairly gradual growth 
in the amount of traffic. This is a good trend—at least it’s not going down.
Dealing with Spam Traffic and Bots
One issue to be aware of when monitoring traffic to web sites and blogs is 
that sometimes there are automated bots that appear like regular users. In 
theory, this traffic is filtered out, but part of the point is to think critically and 
dig beneath the surface. In Blogger, you can look at traffic sources, which is 
also an interesting way to learn more about your web site. You can see where 
your visitors are coming from.
For example, it appears that a large proportion of traffic is coming from 
semalt.com. What’s that?
It looks like it is some kind of web promotion service. It’s not a news site or 
blog. It looks like some kind of automated crawler that would get noticed by 
an analyst.
The longer a web site or blog is around, the more some of these traffic 
sources will result in true referrals—where people linked to your web site or 
blog because they like it. The idea is to keep an eye on traffic sources. In some 
cases, you might be able to establish a relationship with the traffic source and 
let them know when you have a new blog post or product.
As it is, because 2069.us hasn’t been updated in a while, it looks like it’s getting 
mostly automated traffic. Another traffic source is baidu, a Chinese search 
engine. I have no idea how the blog ended up on the site, or why people would 
visit it, but maybe it was just interesting enough to generate a few clicks.
Looking at Traffic in Google Analytics
You can also look at traffic in Google Analytics (in a deeper way). Try clicking 
on Acquisition ➤ All Traffic:

Introduction to Google Analytics
45
At this stage, I just recommend exploring and trying things out. There will be 
plenty of time to dive into documentation and details later. For now, try to 
treat Google Analytics like an amusement park, where you try to find things 
that are amusing. Who said data can’t be fun?
Tracking Mobile Hits
If you were starting to doze off in the previous sections, maybe the idea of 
tracking mobile hits will get your attention. It’s a hot, growing wildly success-
ful area in consumer electronics, apps, and web site development. Analytics 
gives you a way to look at mobile hits. For example, in Google Analytics, go to 
Audience ➤ Mobile:
It can be interesting to see the percentage of your traffic coming from different 
devices:

Chapter 4 | Reviewing Performance of Campaigns
46
This represents another way that analytics can be used to deliver value to a 
business. Do they know the percentage of traffic coming from mobile? What 
is the trend? Is mobile traffic increasing? This might mean that the business or 
organization needs to pay more attention to being mobile friendly.
If you start making your site more mobile friendly or use mobile advertising, 
analytics can help you measure the impact. The ROI. Remember that ROI is 
the Holy Grail!
You could look at the trend toward mobile device usage. You can look at 
it before your site was mobile friendly, as well as after. Is there a difference? 
Hopefully there will be. Business owners, people in organizations, pay very 
close attention to this kind of information. It is very, very valuable. You can 
see clearly the impact of initiatives, of spending time and money on campaigns 
and improvements.
This is why analytics is so important. See how it works? Just something to 
keep in mind as you’re learning to use it. It’s an important piece of the pie.
Another issue to consider is the way the information comes across. For 
example, a chart is one thing, but why not a pie graph? In Google Analytics, 
you can click in the little row of icons to get a pie graph in this view of mobile:
It opens a color-coded view that is easier to consume.
At a single glance, you see that overall mobile traffic is a quarter of the total 
traffic (mobile devices and tablets, which fall into the mobile category as well).

Introduction to Google Analytics
47
As you begin to look at these kinds of things, you can start to ask interesting 
questions, in a kind of “mix and match” mentality.
For example, what is the bounce rate for mobile traffic to your web site? A 
higher bounce rate on mobile devices might indicate that the site isn’t mobile 
friendly. But how do you check this?
I think it’s important to learn how to learn, so I recommend starting by asking 
these types of questions. Then see if you can figure out how to look under 
the hood. You can also cheat by Googling. For example, try Googling “mobile 
bounce rate in Google Analytics”.
Using Dashboards/Reports
When you’re in the position of looking at web analytics for your own site or 
for someone else’s, you can manually go into the tool and find items. However, 
this can be time consuming, and Google Analytics includes dashboards and 
reports you can create to make your life easier.
In Google Analytics, click on Reporting at the top:
Then choose Dashboards ➤ New Dashboard:
Then select Starter Dashboard and change Untitled Dashboard to whatever 
name you like:

Chapter 4 | Reviewing Performance of Campaigns
48
Finally, click Create Dashboard.
Next, you will probably want to set a date range. There’s nothing wrong with 
the default, but setting date ranges is part of the way you get the information 
that’s most relevant.
To change the date range, click on the little triangle to the right of the dates 
that show:
Consider the preset options, such as Last Week, which might be a good date 
range for a regular, weekly report:
After you select a date range, click Apply:

Introduction to Google Analytics
49
Exporting and Scheduling Reports
Next you may want to manually export a report, in order to share it with  
colleagues or clients. To do this, you click Export and select PDF:
I also recommend setting up a scheduled report via e-mail. To do this, click 
Email:
Then enter an e-mail address to send the report to:

Chapter 4 | Reviewing Performance of Campaigns
50
Then click in the main area and add a message, such as, “Here is the weekly 
report”. Then click Send:
You can always come back to Dashboards to adjust your options:
If you went through these steps, you have fully entered the world of web 
analytics. You looked at traffic and performance and then set up some 
reporting so that you can monitor traffic on an ongoing basis. Woo-hoo!
Learning More
Aside from the Google searches mentioned earlier, I recommend exploring 
Google Analytics. When you come across something you’re interested in, do 
a Google search on the concept.
To synthesize your learning, I also recommend making a blog post, discussing 
what you’re learning, including the questions you have, and asking people for 
comment.

Conclusion
Congratulations! You just made it through a significant set of milestones. You 
broke through the data barrier, created some traffic, learned how to view 
data using various tools, experimented with multiple social media channels, 
and looked at behavioral data. Just getting your feet wet in these areas is 
impressive. Good job!
If there’s any way for you to have the right mindset that will help you get 
through the material and master the tool, I do believe that fun can pave the 
way. Hopefully, you can find something interesting when creating your own site, 
trying to promote it a little, and looking at how consistent effort over time 
can have an impact. I argue that web analytics is a critical part of marketing 
partly because of inspiration. That is, when you see the impact, the results of 
your effort, it inspires you to pursue things consistently over time.
This translates into fiscal ROI and an impact in a business setting. When you 
trace impact, you can show how important it is to make adjustments and 
show the importance of the online marketing efforts. It really helps, and it 
definitely gets attention. Instead of guessing and hoping, you get a clear sense 
of what’s going on.

set up a Shopify account, which is one of the easiest ways to set up a “real” 
e-commerce system to learn about tracking ROI with analytics. I think it’s 
important to see how you can set things up so that when you create an ad, 
you can track exactly how much money you are making. This is a fundamental 
concept and opportunity in analytics, where Google Analytics and AdWords 
can act together. My goal has been to find the easiest, least expensive way to 
set up the moving pieces, and Shopify is part of the puzzle. Originally, I was 
going include the entire lifecycle in one chapter, but I decided to split the 
chapter into two—this first chapter lays the foundation in Shopify, and the 
next chapter covers connecting things in AdWords.

In an ideal world, this would be free, but from what I can tell, there isn’t an 
e-commerce platform out there that is free and allows you to do conversion 
tracking. At the time of writing, there are some platforms such as Gumroad 
(covered in Chapter 7), which is free and provides some basic tracking, but if 
you point an ad at a Gumroad site, you are still guessing about the effectiveness 
of particular ads.
The great strength of being able to do “real” conversion tracking is that in 
Google AdWords, you can tell exactly how effective a particular ad has been, 
in terms of revenue. When you or your employer or client is spending money 
on ads, it’s important to know what is most effective, so you can spend money 
on ads with confidence, instead of through guesswork. That’s the exciting 
thing about setting up the full deal.
Setting up Shopify, at $29.95/month, is about the best and easiest way to do 
things at present (e-mail me if you know of an alternative).
Understanding Conversion Tracking
At a high level, conversion tracking allows Google to make 50 billion dollars 
a year. The magic behind this machine is that unlike most other forms of 
advertising, with AdWords you can get analytics that tell you exactly how 
much money you are making, based on what you are spending. If you spent 
money on a billboard, you can only guess at how many people are influenced 
to purchase—and the same thing goes for television, radio, and most other 
forms of advertising.
If you’re spending $1000/month on Google ads and you know you’re making 
10,000 as a result, you can confidently consider increasing the budget, or 
just keeping it in place. Without the conversion tracking, you have no idea. 
Of course, selling something online is not as simple as just placing an ad on 
Google. People have to want what you are selling, and there’s also competition 
for Google ads. But when you follow the best practices for online marketing, 
and when you have conversion tracking in place, it gives you analytics to track 
ROI—the bottom line.
In terms of Google Analytics and Google AdWords, they are both tools. 
They work closely together, but it’s the conversion tracking that makes the 
difference.
Why Shopify? Why “Live”?
My recommendation is to follow along in this chapter as a learning experience 
about how e-commerce comes together, to set up a “live” Shopify site. Start 
thinking about a product that you could sell, even a physical product if you 

Introduction to Google Analytics
55
have one, or think of someone who might like some help exploring this area. 
Another area that is slightly easier to develop and manage, as part of a learning 
experience, is a digital product. Take anything that could be written/developed 
in Microsoft Office or Open Office, save it in PDF format, and make it a digital 
download.
You are also welcome to use the Introduction to Social Media book PDF, or 
one of my other books, as a live file to place on your “test” Shopify store. 
Ultimately, the competition for keywords about social media marketing in 
AdWords means the money you have to spend in order to actually sell the 
PDF might be more than you want, but it’s still worth the test. The only thing 
I’d ask is that you contact me first, partly because if multiple people are using 
it as a sample, it makes sense for me to coordinate “areas” that you could 
target your ads to.
Don’t worry if you don’t have experience in e-commerce, AdWords, etc. I try 
to make it as easy as possible to start out. Even if you want to keep spending 
down to a bare, bare minimum, you can get one or two friends to search 
on Google for the keywords you choose, click on the Google ad, follow it 
through to your site, and purchase the item. That will allow you to see the full 
lifecycle of conversion tracking.
It is an exciting thing, to be able to trace your effects for real. It’s also an 
important skill, and I do think that it’s worth pursuing, so that whether you 
are just learning for yourself, expanding your skillset at work, or building your 
skills to find work, you can say “I have experience setting up an e-commerce 
site and generating analytics with conversion tracking in AdWords”. This will 
definitely get people’s attention.
There might be alternatives to Shopify, but Google itself recommended it as 
an option for e-commerce when they discontinued Google Checkout, and 
Shopify has pretty good support. Using a combination of these chapters, the 
extra links for learning material, and the 800 numbers for support, I think it 
is realistic and doable to try this out. There’s also the Shopify LinkedIn group 
to pose questions to as well (ideally after you’ve tried asking either Google 
or Shopify support).
It is doable, and you will find it exciting, so I recommend trying it. First read 
both of these chapters and then try creating a Shopify site. Then set up the 
Google AdWords after that.
Think of it as a ride at an amusement park—it will be a new experience—but 
it can be fun!

Get Started with Shopify
To get started, go to shopify.com and click Get Started:
■
■Note  Until/unless things change, you can definitely do a free trial to try Shopify without 
spending money. In order to be able to do the conversion tracking, though, you have to pick a plan 
and spend $29.95/mo or so until you cancel. Given the impact it could have on your business, 
career, and employer, I think it’s worth it.
Next, enter your e-mail address, a password, and a name for your store. Click 
Create Your Store Now:

Introduction to Google Analytics
57
The store name could be anything you like it to and should ideally be related 
to the product you are selling. To make it easy, you could just use your initials, 
and say something like JDmarket. You’ll end up with an address like jdmarket.
shopify.com, and if you like this e-commerce thing, you can always upgrade 
to a full web site name like www.jdmarket.com.
When you’ve got a name, choose the Online Store checkbox and click Next:

Chapter 5 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part I: Shopify
58
Then enter your name and address information:
Click Next when you’re done:
At this point, I’m going to follow the scenario of digital products. If you’re 
setting up your site to sell physical products, there’s more to configure, but 
you can always guess and then call Shopify support if you need to.

Introduction to Google Analytics
59
You make some basic choices and click Take Me to My Store:
Next, you add a product.
If you are following along with a digital product, you can enter a title.

Chapter 5 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part I: Shopify
60
Then click Add Product:
Next, you choose images (such as a book cover for a digital product). If you 
are uploading your own and don’t have a cover image, try hiring someone on 
elance.com or odesk.com or read the “Content” chapter in my Introduction to 
Social Media book for some tools on working with images. Try for a 250x450 
image using SnagIt, Photoshop, or Gimp. You can add text and use clipart.
After you upload an image, it should look something like this:

Introduction to Google Analytics
61
Then click Save:
The Shopify wizard will walk you through things, and you can click on the 2 
steps link:
In theory, you should also see a link like this, where you can click View Your 
Store to see a preview of what it looks like:
Customize Navigation
The next thing you’ll want to do is to customize navigation. If you know that 
only you and your friends will be looking at the store, not all the steps I go 
through are necessary, but it’s still a good experience to do it. The more likely 

Chapter 5 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part I: Shopify
62
you are to try and actually get people to visit the store and buy something, the 
more you’ll want to tweak your site.
To customize the navigation, go to the menu on the left side of the screen 
click Navigation:
In this section, I recommend taking out a few things, such as the link to the 
blog, so you don’t have to add content to it or maintain it. If you want to blog 
about your e-commerce store, go for it! Just make sure you regularly add 
posts. You don’t want potential customers to come to the site and find old 
blog posts, or no blog posts, which will make your site seem less professional. 
You can also add a blog later.

Introduction to Google Analytics
63
Next, the Edit Link List link:
Then click the trash icon next to the blog:
Finally, click Save:
If you encounter a link like this, you might just want to skip it for now:

Chapter 5 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part I: Shopify
64
Adding the Product to the Front Page
Even after you add a product, you’ll want to add it to the front page. To do 
this, go to the left navigation and click Collections:
Look for the Front Page collection. Then click on the Add Products menu:
Select the product you added to the system:

Introduction to Google Analytics
65
It should show up in the list:
Then you can click Save:
Tweaking and Payments
Shopify makes it about as easy as possible to set up a fully functional 
e-commerce site and accept payments. It used to be, and often still is, the case 
that you needed to be a web developer, hire one, or learn how to be one, and 
then work with a hosting company to put a lot of pieces together, including 
adding payment processing to your web site, etc. Suffice to say that jumping 
through the hoops on Shopify is a lot easier than other setup situations.
Next, go to your Dashboard:
You will probably see a wizard like this:

Chapter 5 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part I: Shopify
66
If you’re following the “digital products” example, all you need to do is enter 
your banking information. Even if it’s just you and your friends, colleagues, or 
classmates testing things out, you should enter the information to get the full 
effect.
First, click Complete Shopify Payments Account Setup:
You’ll probably want to choose Individual/Sole Proprietorship:

advice, just options to consider.
Next, uncheck We Sell and Ship Physical Goods:
Type in eBooks instead:

67
Then enter your business address:
Finally, enter your bank information:
Click Complete Account Setup:
Then click Save:
Then click Back to Admin:

Chapter 5 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part I: Shopify
68
Next, click the check boxes on the left, to set up shipping rates and tax rates:
Then click Remove Your Store Password, and it will lead you to pick a plan, 
which is covered next.
Picking a Plan
This is where you have to pay. The trial allows you and others to visit the site, 
and it’s live, but they need a password, and random visitors from a Google ad 
can’t get in. In theory, if you tell friends to find the Google ad and click on it 
and you give them the password, technically you might be able to try Shopify 
for free. I haven’t tested that idea, but it’s possible in theory.
My recommendation is to make it live. Go through the exercise of making it 
as professional looking as possible, spend the money if you can, then find a 
person with a real product, physical or digital, to sell. Chances are there are 
a fair number of people in your community who might be trying to find a 
solution like that, and if someone comes along to help them, they might even 
pay for everything, as well as pay you to help them.
Click Pick a Plan:

Introduction to Google Analytics
69
I suggest the cheapest plan. Click Choose this Plan:
Start with the Once a Month plan instead of the yearly plan:
Then click Confirm changes:
Next, click Remove Your Storefront Password:

Chapter 5 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part I: Shopify
70
Uncheck Password Protect Your Storefront:
Then click Save:
■
■Note  If you are paying attention, you might notice that you can connect Google Analytics to 
your storefront. When you do that, what you are mainly gathering is “conventional” analytics, such 
as behavior and number of visitors to your Shopify site. You could try that, but the focus for now is 
on setting up conversion tracking. I suggest filing that away for later, if you plan on wanting to learn 
about e-commerce analytics using an ongoing store.
Click Back to Admin:
Setting a Price
For any product you sell, you’ll need to set the price. Click on the Products 
link:

Introduction to Google Analytics
71
Then select a product to price:
In order to have a price, you have to make a “variant”. E-commerce items like 
t-shirts will often have different sizes, colors, etc., so for a digital download, 
you could just have a name for a particular edition, like “First Edition” or 
“Version 1.0”.
To proceed, click the Edit link:
Type in a variant name and price:
■
■Note  By continuing to read, you agree I’m not giving you business or tax advice.
If you’re doing this as a limited time experience, you may not need to charge 
taxes, and unless you are shipping physical goods, you don’t need to require a 
physical address:

Chapter 5 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part I: Shopify
72
So uncheck both of those boxes and click Save and Close:
■
■Tip  If you plan to sell things on an ongoing basis, I recommend finding an accountant. The 
old principle is, focus on what you do the best (such as marketing) and work with others to do the 
rest (such as accounting). You can do preliminary research on Google, such as “do selling digital 
downloads require charging taxes?”. You can also call Shopify support for questions. Most likely 
they will help you configure your site, but will probably say that ultimate tax strategy should be 
determined in conjunction with an accountant. At a high level, the landscape seems to shift. In 
some cases, if you’re shipping to the same area as your business, taxes may apply, and because 
of changing legislation, there may be taxes anyway. For a long time businesses like Amazon didn’t 
have to charge taxes for online purchases, whereas buying in a local retailer would cause local 
sales tax. But local and state governments are catching up with this and starting to push for 
tax revenue. Something to research if you’re interested in e-commerce. Ultimately, I recommend 
working with an accountant. Better to do it right than get burned later.
Next, you might like to scroll up on the screen and click View in Your Website:
Then take a look. Congratulations! You have fought half the battle in setting 
up an e-commerce site. In the next chapter, you’ll get everything configured 
and find some visitors.

Introduction to Google Analytics
73
The link for your site will be something like this: https://casamarket.
myshopify.com.
Making More Tweaks
These tweaks are not strictly necessary, but recommended. Even if you took 
the blog link off, there might still be a News section on your front page:
To get rid of this, you can click Themes:

Chapter 5 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part I: Shopify
74
Then click Customize Theme:
And Footer:
Then click the X next to blog:
■
■Note  This page also happens to be where you can configure “where” your social media icons 
point. I wouldn’t worry about it, but you can always come back later and add this. In the meantime, 
if anyone clicks on those icons, they will be taken to Shopify.
Finally, click Save:
Updating Content
You’ll want to spruce things up a bit. Click on Pages:

And then click Frontpage:
Add some descriptive text:
For example, using the sample text/files mentioned earlier, you could add the 
following and click Save:

Buy Your Product
At this point, I recommend buying your own product, just to test it out and 
get that sense of satisfaction that comes from setting things up. Click Add to 
Cart:
Click at the cart icon at the top of the screen. If you want to make it clearer to 
visitors what to click on and where, you can add text to your product descrip-
tion, such as “Click on Add to Cart to buy, then click on the Cart icon at the 
top of the screen to check out.”
Next, you can click Check Out:

the e-mail they receive.

Okay, take a deep breath.
Congratulations! You made it through setting up an e-commerce site. It’s live

Conclusion
I think that going through the process of setting up an e-commerce site gets at 
the heart of analytics, bringing you closer than ever to being able to experience 
ROI first hand. Not many online marketing professionals can say they’ve done 
this, especially on their own. Even if you don’t plan on selling anything yourself, 
I recommend considering this. If you end up with an employer or client who 
is trying to figure this out, you’re one step ahead. You might end up doing 
analytics in a situation where all the underlying connections have been made, 
and I still recommend learning about this, so that you can have the “Aha!” 
moment. It’s partly about inspiration. I do believe that ROI is one of the most 
important concepts, if not “the” most important concept, in online marketing. 
This is true whether you see analytics as your full-time job or just a skill in 
your toolbox.
Getting your head around ROI, really understanding it, will help you to be 
a stronger analyst and online marketer, period. If your emphasis is on ROI, 
you will be helping yourself, your employer, and your clients create more 
sustainable online marketing efforts.

Analytics Part II: 
AdWords
The purpose of this chapter and of Chapter 5 is to capture the full lifecycle 
of analytics and take a close look at ROI (return on investment). The goal is 
to shed light on an elusive question—when you are spending money on ads, 
how can analytics help you determine how much money you are making? The 
exciting thing is that AdWords provides a way to do this.
Shopify provides a foundation for e-commerce, and AdWords provides a way 
to advertise a site and track conversion. If you haven’t read Chapter 5 yet, I 
recommend starting there. If you haven’t read Chapters 1-4, I recommend 
starting at the beginning.
E-commerce and AdWords are billion dollar industries, but with the right 
approach, anyone can explore this world in a microcosm. As part of learning 
about analytics and specifically about Google Analytics, it’s worth the effort.

Chapter 6 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part II: AdWords
84
How does AdWords relate to Google Analytics?  When you’re in an e-commerce 
situation, you can use Google Analytics to track behavior on your shopping 
site, just like you can track any other kind of site, in terms of visits, how much 
time people are spending on the site, etc. Platforms like Shopify can connect 
directly to Google Analytics for this kind of information. But what AdWords 
brings to the table is the ability to track conversions—measuring the journey 
customers take from clicking an ad to making a purchase. This is why AdWords 
is so important in generating information and why search engine marketing is a 
desired skill, and important for online marketers to understand.
If you want to learn more about SEO, check out my book titled Introduction to 
Search Engine Marketing and AdWords (Apress, 2017).
Okay, let’s dive in!
Get Started with AdWords
To get started with AdWords, you can follow along in this chapter, if you want 
to dive right in. I have covered the bases as best I can, in a way that allows you 
to move along and try it directly.
If you want some background information first, there are also resources you 
can review, which are also included at the end of the chapter in the Learning 
More section. 
• 
www.google.com/adwords for general information and 
links for learning more
• 
https://support.google.com/adwords is the learning 
center, including guides
If you come to see the value of having AdWords as a skill, I encourage you to 
explore Google’s learning material and consider getting AdWords Qualified. 
It’s free and it can help your career in a direct way.
To get going, the first step is to create an account. Woo-hoo!
■
■Tip  Free AdWords credit. If you’ve been following along and created a Shopify site in the last 
chapter, there are ways to get free AdWords credit, which is basically free money (or free ad budget 
at least). See:

Creating an Account/Getting a Tracking Code
To start an account, go to http://www.google.com/adwords.
Feel free to wander around. The How it Works link may be of interest. When 
you’re ready, click Start Now:
■
■Note  You may want to write down the toll-free support number (1-800-919-9922). It’s in 
Google’s best interest to help you succeed, and they have pretty good support.
When you have an account started, go to Tools ➤ Conversions:
Click Conversion:
This process is setting up a connection between AdWords and your 
e-commerce site. It results in a bit of code that you can bring into Shopify, 
which allows AdWords to track your site.

Chapter 6 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part II: AdWords
86
For example, the scenario you are setting up is that a person sees your ad, 
clicks on it, reaches your site, and ideally buys something. This “conversion 
code” you’re creating allows Google to make a connection between the ad 
and your site. When the visitor reaches the Order Confirmation page or the 
Thank You page, the code is there. Google can report that this specific ad was 
clicked on and resulted in a purchase.
This basically allows you to determine that when you spend a certain amount 
of money on ads, it results in a certain amount of revenue on your e-commerce 
site. AdWords does not magically sell things for you. There’s an art and science 
to selling, but the fundamental opportunity is significant for any business, and 
it’s very solid, compared to traditional forms of advertising.
If you’re planning on connecting AdWords and Shopify, you may want to 
review this link, which provides an overview and additional information around 
connecting the two:
http://docs.shopify.com/manual/your-store/dashboard/

After clicking the Conversion button, enter a conversion name:
Click Save and Continue.
Then click “The value of this conversion action may vary”. This allows you to 
set different prices.

Next, set the Conversion Category to Purchase/Sale:
Make sure that the Markup Language is set to HTML:
Then click Save and Continue:
In the next section, click “I make changes to the code”:
Finally, click the Done button.

Chapter 6 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part II: AdWords

Next, Google will give you the code, and you should copy it (Ctrl+C):

Back in Shopify, go into Settings:
Click Checkout:
Paste the code into the Additional Content and Scripts area:

Introduction to Google Analytics
89
Click the Save button:
To Modify or Not to Modify
In terms of actually changing the code, Google says you should do it:
The Shopify documentation provides a way to do it (even showing relevant 
parts in red):
If you are approaching this as a learning experience, you don’t have to change 
the code, though. Just remember that when you try the ad out and get 
someone to click on it and buy your test product (even if it’s a friend), you’ll 
get a conversion value, but it will be $1.00. If you actually want it to represent 
the price of the products, you have to replace the code.
Don’t be alarmed about the code; just think of it as a recipe.
For example, a recipe might say:
	1)	 Get some bread
	2)	 Put some peanut butter on a slice
	3)	 Put the other slice on

Chapter 6 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part II: AdWords
90
Google is giving you a recipe for Shopify:
	1)	 Here’s some code
	2)	 Shopify, the value we place on the items will be $1.00 
unless we change the recipe
	3)	 Have a nice day
It might look a little different (everyone has their own lingo, right?)
var google_conversion_label = "ntvnCPWE5goQu92B8gM";
var google_conversion_value = 1.00;
var google_remarketing_only = false;
You go to the Shopify article and select the relevant recipe replacement:
And you replace the particular part of the “code recipe” with something new:
var google_conversion_label = "ntvnCPWE5goQu92B8gM";
if ({{ subtotal_price }}) { var google_conversion_value = {{ 
subtotal_price | money_without_currency }}; }
var google_remarketing_only = false;
If we bring it back into the kitchen, all you’re really doing is saying that instead 
of peanut butter, you can choose what to put in the sandwich. So instead of this:
	1)	 Get some bread
	2)	 Put some peanut butter on a slice
	3)	 Put the other slice on
You end up with this:
	1)	 Get some bread
	2)	 Put some [whatever you want] on a slice
	3)	 Put the other slice on
All the code is doing is having one computer speak to another, or one program 
speak to another, etc. It’s basically just a set of directions to do something.

Introduction to Google Analytics
91
Given the fact that you have the article, Google support, and Shopify support, 
I think you can do it. The advantage to changing the code is that then your site 
is real. That could be exciting, to know you’ve done it, and to be able to say 
you’ve done it.
But don’t feel bad if it seems like too much—you can always come back later 
and try it for real.
Even if you don’t modify the code, you’ll still end up being able to test the 
connection between AdWords and Shopify, and all your wildest analytics 
dreams will come true.
What’s Going On
To come back to Earth from the galactic analytics kitchen, consider the Order 
Confirmation page. The code that Google gives you, a “snippet” of code, which 
you can either use as is or tweak, is used by Shopify on the Thank You page.
So when someone clicks on your ad, purchases something, and checks out, 
they end up on the Thank You page. When it displays, it tells Google there was 
a purchase.

Chapter 6 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part II: AdWords
92
■
■Fun  If you don’t believe me, you can test the shopping cart process out (after you’ve added 
the conversion code). Then, in your browser, right-click on the page (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac), 
and choose View Source. Pretend you’re looking at a recipe book and see if you can find something 
that looks like the conversion code that Google gave you. Then you’ll win a prize! Okay, the prize is 
the knowledge that you’ve discovered the code you planted there.
Create an AdWords Campaign
Now that you’ve connected Shopify and AdWords, you can create an ad so 
that you can try it in real life.
Alternatively, you can get something a friend wrote and sell it as a digital 
product, or even find a physical product. But to keep the momentum going, all 
I’m saying is there are options.
In short, the world’s your oyster!
What you’ll see very soon is that AdWords ads cost money—surprise! But 
that’s fair. In order to make money, you have to spend money. Analytics allow 
you to see if you’re spending money effectively. Did your ad work? If people 
clicked on it, did they buy anything?
To be clear, Google charges you when people click on your ad. This provides 
you visitors. It’s up to you to get people to buy something.
There’s competition, so when you’re paying Google for the clicks, it’s like a kind 
of eBay auction. For example, say you own a company that sells basketballs 
and there’s another company that does the same. You both want to get people 
to click on your ads. When people type “basketball” into Google, there’s a 
bidding situation.
This is where it can be helpful to review some of the background info, as 
mentioned earlier.
On the bright side, you can sometimes get free ad credit. Check out:
http://ecommerce.shopify.com/c/ecommerce-marketing/t/aha-this-
is-how-to-get-your-google-adwords-and-facebook-credit-121154
At this point, you can limit your “ad spend”. You bid very low and make your 
product price very low, just to get some friends to find the ad, click, and buy 
the product, so you can test things out. Then you can always come back and 
try the finer points by experimenting with different prices and bidding, in an 
effort to get “real” customers. That can be exciting. Think of that—an exciting 
analytics learning experience.

Yes, it can take money, but it can be exciting. Especially if you’re doing it for a 
client, a friend, or an employer. At that point, I definitely recommend getting 
AdWords Qualified, so that you can increase your chances of selling effectively.
At any rate, when you’re ready to try AdWords, go into AdWords and click 
Campaign:
For the moment, click Search Network only.
Next, give the campaign a name:
Next you will be given a chance to set a budget. Ignore everything else for 
the moment.
I suggest $5.00 a day for learning. It doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily spend 
$5.00/day; this is only if people actually click on the ad. But you can limit a 
budget and change it later, and that’s the important thing to remember.

Feel free to click on the little question mark icons wherever you see them to 
learn more.
Then click Save and Continue:
Next, the wizard will ask you to enter your landing page:
You can get this page URL by going into Shopify and clicking on the middle 
icon on the bottom-left side:

Introduction to Google Analytics
95
Technically, your site page can be your landing page. This is the page where 
people go when they click the ad.
As with other aspects of AdWords, there is an art and science to landing 
pages, which is part of the way you increase the chances of someone buying 
something (by selling the value proposition, etc.). Just for learning purposes, 
you can copy that link from your browser and bring it back into AdWords.
Next, you can give your ad group a name if you like. What AdWords is doing is 
giving you an opportunity (by scanning your “landing page”) to get some ideas 
for keywords.
When creating an ad, ultimately you are targeting a particular keyword or set 
of keywords related to your product. Ask yourself, what would people type in 
Google if they were interested in my product?
This screen gives you the ability to get some ideas. Click on the little arrow 
icons on the right:

96
You can use the Automatic Ideas wizard, and you can also type in phrases of 
your own:
Then click Continue to Ads:
My advice is, especially if your head is swimming, to make an ad and not 
to worry about the particulars or keywords too much. This is just for the 
learning experience. Delete or cancel the ad as soon as are ready and then 
come back and try again. It’s more important to try the full process of making 
an ad, without worrying about getting it exactly right the first time.
This is the core of making the ad in Google, whether you follow the initial 
wizard or create a campaign first, and then create an ad group, and then create 
an ad.
The Destination URL is the link to your e-commerce shopping page. Remember 
you can always click on the little question mark icons for more information.
Next, enter a headline. Try it; you won’t hurt anything. Look at what happens 
on the right:

Try experimenting a bit with headlines and with the ad text. Try to think of 
something that would get someone to click it.
Think creatively. Dream wild! When you are ready, click Save:
Next, you can click Review Campaign:

Chapter 6 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part II: AdWords
98
Here’s where you can bid. Just like with eBay, there’s an art to bidding, but you 
can always just use $1.00 to start:
Google may try to convince you to spend more and bid more:
The fact is that this example has its limits. My goal is to provide a cheap/free 
way to try things out that might result in you actually selling something (woo-
hoo!), even if you used this free social media marketing book as an example.
But for better or worse, especially with social media, there’s always competition!
There happen to be a lot of trainers, schools, consultancies, etc., that are all 
interested in people who want to learn more about social media marketing. 
The prices of their products and services are much higher than a little social 
media marketing book, so they can afford to bid more on keywords.
When you don’t put quotes around a keyword, Google will automatically 
create variations of it. Google takes something like this:
Learning social media marketing
And makes a variation like this:
Social media marketing

Introduction to Google Analytics
99
You could end up in competition with someone who is selling social media 
marketing as a service and charging a lot more money. The bidding will be 
higher than someone who is selling a service to learn about social media 
marketing, or selling a book.
This is just a little taste of how eBay—I mean AdWords—works.
The way it relates to analytics is that there’s data around the competition 
for keywords, their average bidding price, and so on. There are analytics in 
AdWords, in addition to the information that AdWords generates. At the end 
of the day, it can help your career and business.
You can try putting quotes around words so Google uses those exact phrases 
only:
To play this game a bit better, try a tool called the Keyword Planner, discussed 
next.
Use Keyword Planner
To try Keyword Planner, choose AdWords ➤ Tools ➤ Keyword Planner.

This is the toy you can play with to figure out keywords. I mean, this is the tool 
you can utilize to attain clarity on keyword potential.
I played around with it and found that the competition is pretty high.
I dug a little deeper and found that the average “CPC” (cost per click) of 
“social media marketing training” was $7.00. So I thought, okay, I’ll try an ad 
where the bid is $7.00 and I’ll set the price of the product to $7.00 in Shopify.
I adjusted the ad:

Introduction to Google Analytics
101
Then I created a couple more ads, trying different copy:
All this is to say that you should experiment, leverage the analytics, try things 
out, and see what works the best.
AdWords’ Tricky Timing Settings
The other important thing to remember when playing with AdWords is to 
keep track of when a campaign starts and ends. For whatever reason, Google 
added a couple extra steps for actually ending a campaign. You could say that it 
is because many campaigns are ongoing. Or you could say that they are doing 
this because they are apt to make more money.
Either way, I recommend reading this article:
https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2404203?hl=en
Basically, when you create your campaign, be aware that you will want to go 
into Campaign Settings and click Edit next to the Campaign Type:

Chapter 6 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part II: AdWords
102
Then you will want to click the All Features radio button:
Then click Save.
In my opinion All Features should be enabled by default, or there should be an 
easier, more apparent, way to set the schedule (the start and end dates). But 
until that happens, be sure to take these steps to make sure Google doesn’t 
drain your bank account every day, if you are just learning.
Next, after enabling this feature, go into Advanced Settings (cough, cough, it 
should be a basic setting).
Click Schedule:
Doh! Google has decided that your campaign of giving them money has no 
end date:
Click the Edit button and set an end date.
Ah! Much better. Just be aware of these hoops you have to jump through.

Introduction to Google Analytics
103
It’s Not Quite as Simple as This
I’ve covered a lot of ground, but I think it’s worth trying things out, to get a 
sense of how tracking conversion works.
And yes, it’s not as simple as this. Because clicks don’t necessarily mean 
conversion into sales. Someone might click on the ad and not actually buy 
something.
The art and science of AdWords involves working with a variety of analytics. In 
theory, if someone buys something, you can track ad budget against revenue, 
and that is the primary basis for $40-50 billion of Google’s revenue each year, 
which represents a large amount of revenue made by businesses.
Here was the competition I was up against in my little test:
Where oh where is my ad?

Chapter 6 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part II: AdWords
104
Eventually I did find it, on the third page of results. I had a friend click on it to 
test things out.
Depending on what your goal is—to learn or to actually sell something—you 
might want to give yourself the freedom of not worrying too much about the 
keywords and not worrying too much about the bids. Just set things up live 
and get a friend or two to search on Google for your keyword until they find 
the ad. Then buy your product (at a low price!), and give yourself 24 hours to 
look back in AdWords to see the results.
What you’re hoping is to see some converted clicks:
That is the magic of Shopify and AdWords. It’s pretty much at the core of $50 
billion of Google revenue each year, and maybe a trillion dollars of e-commerce 
revenue around the world.
You don’t have to be a big company to do it. You, can in fact, as an analyst or 
online marketer, help people explore this kind of thing, even if you hire an 
AdWords specialist and just review the information.
In short, it’s a technique that millions of businesses—large and small—use, and 
it’s a really solid approach. It can be fun as well.

Analytics Part III: 
Gumroad
This chapter takes another look at e-commerce analytics, courtesy of 
Gumroad, a free, super easy-to-use platform. In some ways, this chapter is 
a back up to the previous two chapters, because it provides another way to 
learn about analytics in a live setting. In the case of Gumroad, there’s an easy 
way to link to Google Analytics, and it also has its own built-in analytics. Even 
though you can’t track conversion directly back to a specific ad, you can get a 
sense of how Google Analytics works with e-commerce, and it is completely 
free. And fun!

Chapter 7 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part III: Gumroad

Conversion vs. Infersion
One of the advantages of writing a book is that I can get away with making up 
a word like “infersion”. But I think it has merit. I think that conversion-related 
analytics are among the most important, if not “the” most important to learn, 
because of how valuable they can be to your bottom line.
On the one hand, you have “direct” conversion tracking analytics available, via 
platforms like AdWords. See Chapters 5 and 6. Google wrote the book on 
this, and the power of this direct conversion tracking is that you can trace 
exactly how effective a specific ad is. Furthermore, you can track how effective 
individual keywords are. These “conversion analytics” help you optimize a 
campaign. For example, when you connect these pieces, analytics allows you 
to optimize, by deleting keywords that don’t perform as well and focusing on 
ones that do better. The analytics help you make an advertising campaign more 
effective and more efficient, and this is very valuable. It helps you generate 
more revenue and use the existing budget more wisely. It is the depth of 
insight that the analytics provide, and this insight helps guide your actions.
On the one hand, if you read these chapters and work through them, you see 
that it takes more effort to set up and track such things. On the other hand, 
it’s worth it. It’s a best practice, and definitely worth learning about and trying.
This is what I call “infersion” tracking. That is, you infer, or guess, what is going 
on, but you don’t really know. In a way, most forms of advertising are based 
on this principle—billboards, radio, television, etc. You advertise, hope for the 
best, look at the sales figures, and hope they go up.
In the case of Gumroad, we are talking about infersion. That is, Gumroad has 
built-in analytics that will tell you how many people visited the site and how 
many people went on to actually purchase an item. As a learning experience, 
these basic analytics are a great starting point.
In order to generate some sample data, I made a post on Facebook to friends 
and asked them to buy the digital ebook (I said I would pay them back on 
PayPal). I also ran a Facebook ad. I didn’t spend a lot of time tweaking the 
Gumroad site—my focus was on generating the data.
In Gumroad, I got 31 views and one sale during the day or two ran this experi-
ment. I was the only one who purchased the item, but for the purposes of the 
example, we’ll pretend that someone else purchased the item.

Introduction to Google Analytics
109
So the conversion rate is 1 sale for every 31 visits. If you divide 1/31, you get 
.032, which is basically a 3% conversion rate.
The actual conversion rate isn’t as important as the fact that it provides you 
with actionable insight. You can measure the effectiveness of your efforts to 
improve things, over time. For example, I could spend more time improving 
the site, adding more visuals and a more compelling value proposition and 
follow the best practices of digital marketing. I might also make a separate 
landing page, where I could focus on these things, and then and only then refer 
people to the “catalog”.
After I made these kinds of efforts, I would hope to improve the conversion 
rate of people coming to the site. Gumroad’s built-in analytics provides some 
limited insight, but it is still actionable.
As for the the Facebook ad I made, Gumroad can’t tell me anything about it. It 
also can’t tell me whether one ad was better than another if when have more 
than one version.
Technically, if I was only running a single advertising campaign, I could “infer” 
how well the ad campaign was based on looking at sales. Since it is my only 
ad, I can reasonably guess that it is the force behind sales. But what if there’s 
traffic coming from different sites, or what if a blogger picks up the site? That’s 
when it gets harder to track the impact. So “infersion” has its limits.
Still, I think it is worth looking at.
As you’ll see, there are a few things you can do in Google Analytics (which 
“expands” Gumroad’s basic analytic capabilities), and they can provide a bit 
more insight.

Chapter 7 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part III: Gumroad

Google Analytics, AdWords, and Gumroad
For those who are interested in looking at the finer points, I mention an 
area to look into called e-commerce tracking. My approach and intent with this 
book has been to keep things as simple as possible and to focus on learning 
experiences that can help you understand some of the fundamental concepts 
in analytics.
Technically speaking, in Chapters 5 and 6, the focus was on AdWords and 
Shopify. There were analytics “in” AdWords, and in conversion tracking, you 
can trace this without ever touching Google Analytics. However, when you 
are running AdWords campaigns and have Google Analytics installed, you can 
get additional insight by linking AdWords and Google Analytics.
I don’t want to spend too much time on this because I think learning by 
doing is the best way to get a handle on things—but suffice it to say that 
there’s more than one way to do things. I think you can think of it like layers 
in an onion. You can track conversions with AdWords, but linking to Google 
Analytics can provide more insight. (Do Google searches on “e-commerce 
tracking in adwords” or “linking AdWords and Analytics” for example.)
The same principle applies to Gumroad—there’s a basic way to connect 
Google Analytics, but there’s also a way to set “goals” to provide further 
insight (see the “Learning More” section at the end of this chapter).
My general recommendation is to Gumroad on its own, then try Google 
Analytics, then maybe try setting “goals” in Google Analytics. If possible, try 
selling an actual product, even if it is just friends who buy it (or yourself!).
Let’s get started!
Get Started with Gumroad
One of the reasons that Gumroad is simple is because it is built on selling 
digital downloads.
To get started with Gumroad, go to gumroad.com and click Start Selling:
Then enter an e-mail address and password and click Create Account:

Introduction to Google Analytics
111
Next, name your store and enter a description in the bio section:
If you are going to do this for real, you will probably want to expand the 
bio. Go back to Settings in Gumroad and edit/expand the text. Gumroad at 
present is a bit limited—it’s mainly a streamlined shopping cart for digital 
downloads, so it’s not really built to be a “landing page” for an ad campaign, 
at least in terms of text formatting, having visuals, and fine-tuning your value 
proposition. But if you do want to add credibility, you can expand the bio sec-
tion and see what I did for the text that appears at http://gumroad.com/
casamarketing.
When you choose a username, this is what will appear in the link:
My store link became gumroad.com/casamarketing.

Chapter 7 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part III: Gumroad
112
Next, confirm language settings and set the time zone:
Then enter an e-mail address and choose the desired options:
Then, for now, just click Update Account Details:
You’ll notice that this section has an area to connect Google Analytics, and the 
way you get back is to go to Settings in Gumroad. But you need a code from 
Google Analytics, so we’ll discuss that next.

Introduction to Google Analytics
113
Connect to Google Analytics
You may want to start out by just skipping ahead, adding a product in Gumroad, 
and buying one yourself to generate data, or post to social, or otherwise just 
get a few sales in Gumroad, before jumping into Google Analytics. Nothing 
wrong with that.
If you can, I recommend going the extra mile and putting the foundation in 
for Google Analytics. In order to do this, you need to know the link for your 
Gumroad store (choose Gumroad ➤ Settings).
In my case, it was gumroad.com/casamarketing:
The reason you need it is to tell Google Analytics what site it is tracking.
So, to get a code from Google analytics, go into Google Analytics:
http://www.google.com/analytics/
At the site, click Access Google Analytics:
(This will appear when you are signed in to Gmail/Google and go to the site. 
If not, you may have to sign in.) 
Next, click on the Admin link:

Chapter 7 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part III: Gumroad
114
There are multiple ways to add a new site, but this one may be easy enough. 
You’ll have an account, and you’ll need to add a new property, which is a new site:
Click on the Property drop-down:
Click Create New Property:

Introduction to Google Analytics
115
Select Website:
Then set up a name (it’s not important as long as it makes sense to you). Paste 
in the link of your Gumroad site:
Choose a category, set a time zone, and click Get Tracking ID.
■
■Note  Even if you are just running a test, you’ll want to set up your own Gumroad store, even 
if you just upload a “dummy” PDF file for digital download. In other words, use your own link, with 
your own username. If you try gumroad.com/casamarketing, you won’t get any data.
Next, you’ll get a page with code on it.

Chapter 7 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part III: Gumroad
116
Select the tracking ID:
Copy it into memory. Press Ctrl+C, right-click, then choose Copy in Windows, 
or press Ctrl+click and choose Copy on a Mac.
Then you can keep it in memory or paste it somewhere.
Back to Gumroad
To paste your Google code, go into Gumroad and then into Settings:
In the Advanced section, paste in the code:

Introduction to Google Analytics
117
After it is pasted in, click Update Account Details:
Add a Product to Gumroad
To test your Gumroad account further, you need to add a product.
To get started, click Products:
Click Add a Product:
Then click Product type on the left:
It’s very easy, relatively speaking, to add products in Gumroad, compared to 
most e-commerce platforms.

Chapter 7 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part III: Gumroad
118
Just type in a name for the product and add a file to it.
It will give you progress on the upload:
You then choose a price and click Add:
You might just want to make the price $1.00 to keep things as cheap as possible.
Next, you need to upload a cover for the product. Gumroad likes square 
images. Feel free to use the “cover 250x250” image, review the chapter on 
“Content” in my Introduction to Social Media book, use an image created in a 
program like SnagIt or Gimp, or try picresize.com.

Introduction to Google Analytics
119
Click Upload a Cover:
I also recommend clicking on the Describe this Product field and entering a 
description.
When you’re ready, click the Save Changes button:
Then click Publish:

Chapter 7 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part III: Gumroad
120
Setting Up Payment
This may not be strictly necessary for testing, but you’ll probably want to set 
up payment. Depending on where you’re at in the process, you might need to 
click on Products in Gumroad:
The easiest approach is to set up direct deposit. You just enter a checking 
account and routing number, which you can get from a check:
Then you click Change on Tax Settings if you want to. If you’re just testing 
your account, you can ignore the tax settings for the moment.
■
■Note  By continuing to read, you’re acknowledging that I am not giving you financial advice 
about e-commerce taxes. If you plan on selling anything on an ongoing basis, I recommend 
consulting an accountant. You might also want to click on Gumroad’s Learn More link.
When you’re ready to move forward, click Save Payout Settings.

Introduction to Google Analytics
121
Check Your Gumroad Site
At some point, if you haven’t done so already, you’ll want to check your 
Gumroad site to see what it looks like.
If you’re not clear yet on the link, go into Gumroad and click on Settings:
Then scroll down and see what it says under username:
Then you can copy and paste that link into a browser. I recommend test-
ing with multiple browsers, specifically Firefox (firefox.com) and Chrome 
(google.com/chrome). Work with Gumroad in one, and then “test” the site 
in the other. The reason is that when you’re logged into Gumroad, the site 
appears slightly differently than when you’re not, so by going into a separate 
browser where you’re not logged in, you get a better picture of the site.

Chapter 7 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part III: Gumroad
122
Get Some Traffic to Sell
As with earlier chapters and based on techniques in my Introduction to Social 
Media book, I suggest trying to get a bit of traffic to the site, through a 
combination of making an ad on Facebook, or using AdWords, or both, as well 
as making an appeal on social media to your friends.
Gumroad does have some built-in connections to make it slightly easier. Try 
going to Timeline:

Introduction to Google Analytics
123
Then click Share on Facebook:
You can also select and copy the short link (gum.co/etc.) to text, e-mail, or 
post to friends.
Then make some kind of kindly appeal for people to click and buy the product, 
and click Share:
Reviewing the Analytics
After you get some traffic and at least one purchase, you can go to Analytics 
in Gumroad:

Chapter 7 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part III: Gumroad
124
Be aware that you do need one purchase to “activate” analytics in Gumroad. 
Divide the number of sales by the number of views to get your conversion rate.
Then, go back to the drawing board, improve the site, lower the price, do 
some research on making a landing page, and then link to your Gumroad site 
again. See how the statistics change.
For example, you can try a search on landing page tools:
https://www.google.com/#q=landing+page+tools
Or try Googling “landing page best practices” as well.
Link to your Gumroad store and see if you can improve your conversion rate.
Reviewing Google Analytics
■
■Note  Google Analytics, and web tools in general, will change interfaces from time to time, so 
you might have to dig to find certain features. For example, there are some helpful links at the end 
of this chapter that Gumroad provides about connecting Google Analytics to Gumroad. The exact 
position of the information may change, though. I still recommend the article, but keep in mind you 
might have to dig around for it. The moral of the story is, play around and search for things, and 
when all else fails, Google it, because someone else probably had the same question and blogged 
about it. Remember, you can blog about it too!
Take screenshots! Share your thoughts on what you learned! Make a blog! 
Share it with others! This is how many blog entries came into being that so 
many people have found helpful. Someone had to do it, even if they didn’t feel 
like an expert. Try it! Build your portfolio!

Introduction to Google Analytics
125
Go to Google Analytics and select All Website Data in the property you want 
to look at:
Next, go down to Behavior on the left, then to Events, and finally to Overview:
You’ll see something like what you see in Gumroad:

Chapter 7 | Fun with E-Commerce Analytics Part III: Gumroad
126
The difference is that you can dig a little deeper. For example, try scrolling 
down and clicking on Event Action:
At this level, you’ll get a sense across all products of how many times people 
clicked “I want this” in Gumroad, and of those people, who actually made a 
purchase:
This is an example of analytics related to abandonment. To learn more, Google 
“cart abandonment” and “abandon rate e-commerce”. It’s something that 
e-commerce businesses pay close attention to, in terms of looking at how 
many people go along the process of visiting the site, and where they tend to 
drop off.
For example, if people click on the Buy button but don’t check out, there 
could be a misunderstanding about how to check out, or an issue with shipping 
prices, etc. By looking at where a person leaves the site, you can pinpoint 
actions you can take to reduce abandonment.
The information from Gumroad ➤ Google Analytics is pretty limited, 
relatively speaking, but it gives you a general idea. In more extensive analytics 
environments, such as Shopify, you may be able to get more information on 
the paths people take, as well as get a sense of where the highest percentage 
of people are dropping off.
In our example, you could also go to the same spot in Google Analytics and 
click on Event Category, and then click on an individual product: (such as 
product-bVxL)
This will give you a closer view of an individual product.

Introduction to Google Analytics
127
Then you can click on Event Action from there.
It will give you similar information for a specific product. This is important, 
because if you have multiple products, it’s important to track the difference 
between them. In some cases with analytics,  you’ll want to drill down to a 
specific product level.

Conclusion
Congratulations on taking another tour through analytics and e-commerce!
I encourage you to continue exploring various connections you can make, 
between shopping carts, analytics and ad campaigns. This is the “core” of web 
analytics, and Google Analytics can play a central role in helping to make 
sense of things. If you haven’t already, you may also want to collaborate—
concentrate on what you do the best and work with others to do the rest! For 
example, if you want to focus on the analytics, find a friend or local business 
or organization that has something to sell, and work with them on getting a 
site up and going. Integrate Google Analytics and get a sense of visitors. Then 
try selling something or get someone else to run the ad campaign and look at 
conversion tracking. Then optimize the site.
Start out simple, have some fun, and before you know it, you will be considered 
a web analytics guru—even if you don’t feel like one!
In the next chapter, we look at the ultimate goal of this book, or one of the 
ultimate goals. We explore and inspire you to dig into Google’s free learning 
material, and work toward getting certified in Google Analytics. This book 
was mainly written to introduce you to analytics, and to help you try a few 
things, have some fun, and get some momentum. Learning more about Google 
Analytics is the next step. It will give you confidence, it will help your career, 
and it might even help you get a new client or a new job for that matter. It’s 
doable, and I highly recommend it!

Exploring 
Google Analytics 
Certification
This chapter explores some of the opportunities that Google offers, in terms 
of learning material, and the Google Individual Qualification (IQ), which can be 
a nice thing to have on your web site or resume.
Maybe you can take me on faith that certification/qualification is doable. It’s 
especially doable if you have resources to rely on, including people. The 
benefits of going through the process are many, including a definite positive 
impact on your career.
Imagine adding a Google certification to your LinkedIn profile:

These qualifications give your resume extra impact, whether you are job 
searching, interacting with other professionals, or just boosting your creden-
tials at your current job.
It can also be a good thing for your business, when you list your staff on your 
web site and show that they have these certifications.
Going through the certification process also helps to round out your 
knowledge. It’s smart to be acquainted with new features that you might end 
up using at some point.
Exploring Google Analytics Qualification
What’s the difference between certification and qualification? It’s basically 
interchangeable, as far as I can tell.
To explore Google Analytics Qualification, check out this site: www.google.
com/intl/en/analytics/learn/.

Introduction to Google Analytics

I think it’s good to go through the process of starting your own account, but 
you can try the demo account as well.
Be sure to look at the other articles.
The Analytics Academy is also worth paying attention to. The point is that it’s 
free training given by a global company, and it’s in their best interest for you 
to succeed.
I recommend going directly to this Google site to become familiar with some 
of the self-study material they have:

Roadmap for Certification
My general suggested roadmap is to take a peek at some of the resources 
mentioned in this chapter and then do two things in parallel:
• 
Use Google Analytics: You’ll get more out of the materials 
as you prepare to take the Google Analytics test if you’re 
actually using the program.
• 
Go to the Analytics Academy link: Review the roadmap they 
set up for studying, and if you like, start by watching some 
of their videos.
And at some point, sooner or later, you’ll want to read, “How to Prepare for the 
Google IQ” at https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3424288. 
Remember to review the “Additional Resources” section as well.
Get Ready, Go!
When you’re ready, go ahead and register at google.com/partners. In my 
classes I teach, I recommend people take the exam once just to see what it’s 
like. So go ahead!
Then study some more so you can pass it. You can do it! It’s doable. I’ve had 
many students pass it. If they can do it, you can do it. They all feel good when 
they pass, and they can put it on their resume and on LinkedIn. If you have 
coworkers or a manager, it’s a great thing to tell them too. If you’re in the job 
market, I know for a fact that the certification impresses recruiters.
Not only do I think the IQ is doable, but I think it can have a good impact on 
your career, as well as on your business or organization. Even if you’re not in 
the job market yet, the fact that it’s a top skill means learning it is important.
As I mentioned in the introduction, LinkedIn shows digital/online marketing as 
a top skill that gets people hired year after year, and web analytics is one of the 
core digital marketing skills. Being able to understand the performance of web 
sites and ad campaigns is important. Analytics is considered a part of business 
intelligence, which also figured prominently on the list:

Demand will fluctuate over time, but we are talking about the top skills in any 
field that get people hired.

Don’t forget how nice it will look to have this on your LinkedIn profile. 
Thousands of people have done it. You can too!
Long-Term Goal: Certified Partner
If you work for or will likely end up at a “services” company, where you 
help others with marketing, you might want to consider the Certified Partner 
program. It’s a bit involved, but in order to compete, to deliver needed value 
to other businesses and organizations, you should seriously consider going 
down this road:
https://www.google.com/analytics/partners/listing/service
Based on what I’ve seen, analytics is one of those areas that is very, very solid. 
You’re providing crucial insight to businesses and organizations, and in a com-
petitive market, it’s a skill set and a service that is in high demand.
It takes some effort and it may take a while to grow things. I just want to 
encourage you to consider it. Let’s say you find yourself up against 10 other 
social media businesses or 10 other marketing agencies. How many of them 
have people who are certified in Google Analytics? How many of them are 
actually certified on the business level? If you want to have a steady, long-term 
stream of business, to supplement other things, I have a pretty strong feeling 
that heading in this direction can only help you.
But don’t take my word for it—do some background research.
A business that has Google-certified consultants inspires confidence:

Conclusion
Congratulations on making it through this chapter! And the book for that 
matter! If you want a roadmap for doing the Google IQ, timeline-wise, I 
suggest reviewing the “units” at a rate of one per week, so that you’re making 
steady progress but also give yourself time to use the program.
After reading the chapters in this book, you should be able to generate some 
traffic, even if you aren’t connected to anyone else. I suggest checking to see if 
there are any local businesses or organizations who might like some help. Go 
to your local chamber of commerce or an organization that local businesses

belong to. Chances are there will be someone who has a web site and would 
be interested in having someone look at their web analytics free of charge. If 
there’s any way you can set that in motion, I think that actively looking at some 
kind of traffic will help give you perspective.
But don’t wait—start reviewing the material.
Best wishes!
