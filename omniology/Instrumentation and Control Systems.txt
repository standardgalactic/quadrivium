FOREWORD
M
astery of instrumentation is a challenge. The physics of measured process, principles
of sensing, different possible sensors, and the process environment are all to be well
 understood and a well thought out selection made to match the application. The
book is a good balance in the sense that it does justice to all the relevant aspects. Sukumar
has organized it in a well thought out manner. Starting with the basics of measurement, the
book progresses through the need and scope of standardization and the modules of an
instrumentation scheme methodically; subsequently the schemes are dealt with in depth.
Their selection and organization is from an application angle. All major application segments
are discussed in adequate depth and detail. I am sure that the book will prove to be a valuable
asset to the student community as well as the interested professionals.

PREFACE 
 
nstrumentation and control systems are essential activities in every branch of science and technology. We 
need to know our body temperature, the blood pressure, temperature of the induction stove, speed of our 
car/bike, salt content level in the water, etc. Also, we need to control systems for water level control, 
temperature control in oven, refrigerator and air conditioners. Therefore, the study of instrumentation and 
control systems is essential for engineering and technology students. There are a number of books available in 
the market on ‘Instrumentation’ and ‘Control systems’, separately. In many universities, Instrumentation and 
Control Systems are combined as a single subject and offered. Very few books are available in the market to 
meet this requirement. Students always express the need for a comprehensive text on Instrumentation and 
Control Systems. A small effort is taken in this direction by a group of Engineers to bring this book.  
 
The book is divided into three parts. Part I (Chapters 1 to 7) introduces the fundamental concepts 
required to understand the subject. This part discusses about standards, uncertainty management, errors in the 
measurements and how to tackle them, characteristics of instruments, signal conditioning units, and signal 
presentation units. Also, if one needs to use computers for measurement and control purposes, the necessary 
fundamentals are presented with some sample codes. 
 
Part II (Chapters 8 to 18) deals with individual measurement/instrumentation techniques. One can 
approach this part in two ways: based on type of transducers and listing the applications and the other way is to 
list the sensors for each of the parameters. In this book, the second approach is used, as it will be easy for the 
learners to get a comprehensive idea about various options available to measure a particular parameter. Part II 
specifically examines the principles, construction, working, advantage, disadvantage and applications of 
transducers for measuring displacement, strain, liquid level, force, torque, pressure, flow, density, vibration, 
temperature and PH. 
 
Part III (Chapters 19 to 24) introduces control systems concepts. It gives a frame work for 
mathematical modeling, block diagram, signal flow diagram, time and frequency domain analysis, and stability 
analysis. The book is aimed at the students taking courses in ‘Instrumentation and Control’ at undergraduate 
and post graduate levels and the working professionals in this field.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
e take this opportunity to thank Poojya Swamiji, Abhayamrita Chitanya, the driving force 
AMRITA, for his timely support during our critical periods. We have learnt how to help people 
and to whom to help, from Swamiji. 
The first author conceived the idea of writing this book during his interaction with Dr T.R. Padmanabhan 
regarding the subject matter. The interaction was mainly informal discussions for clarifying doubts from Dr 
Padmanabhan. During that time he was Dean-Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, who had already 
written many books in engineering including Industrial Instrumentation. He inspired many (including authors) 
not only by his words, but also by his dedicated actions. The pages are not sufficient to describe the enjoyable 
timely small stories, the way he conducted short and effective meetings and so on. May we take this 
opportunity to pay our accolade to a real teacher who took a lot of pain in training us for no gains. 
A very similar and a saintly person there, is our Guide, Dr K.I. Ramachandran, who magnanimously and in 
good nature guided us. We have learnt how to give freedom to the students from him. We are extremely 
grateful and wish to place on record our deep sense of indebtedness and gratitude to Prof. K.I. Ramachandran, 
the intellectual power house, for his valuable guidance, generosity, encouragement and immense help. 
Our heartiest gratitude to Dr Joshi C. Haran, Chairman-Mechanical Engineering, who laid the foundation in 
engineering fundamentals and insisted perfection in every minutest detail. We sincerely thank him for all that 
he has done to us. The authors are grateful to Dr B.K. Vinayagam, Head (Department of Mechatronics, SRM 
University) with whom the authors enjoyed working. 
Our gratitude and sincere thanks to all people who are directly and indirectly involved in compilation of the 
material presented in this book. 
The help rendered by Mrs. Meena Sugumaran, Mrs. Manju Muralidharan, Mr. Dhruv and Ms. Niranjana 
Manickam during the manuscript preparation is warmly acknowledged. We cherish the association with the 
Publisher while bringing out this book (in just 5 years they brought out this book). This section will be 
incomplete if we forget to thank the patience and efforts rendered by our family members to bring out this 
book.

Chapter 6 
OBJECTIVES 
SIGNAL 
CONDITIONING 
In this chapter, we will discuss some of the signal conditioning techniques needed for 
measurement applications. After completing this chapter, you will be able to: 
• Describe the need for signal conditioning 
• Describe pneumatic and electronic amplifiers 
• Understand the function of operational amplifiers and its applications 
• Describe the need and types of filters, and design aRC filter for given specification 
• Describe the function of voltage divider, charge amplifier, Wheatstone bridge, scaling 
devices.

other as shown in Fig. 8.54. The rotor of transmitter is in the form of ‘dumb bell’. Electrical
connection is given through slip rings and brushes. The stator windings in transmitter are
connected to respective windings in transformer as shown below. The rotor of transformer
is fixed to act as reference for angular displacement measurement and the transmitter is
connected to rotating body whose angular displacement is sought for.

Working
The rotor windings are excited with sinusoidal voltage (typically 400 Hz). It forms a flux
with a pattern around the coil. It induces voltage in stator winding by mutual induction.
As the stator windings of transmitter and transformer are connected, it produces a similar
flux pattern in transformer unit stator windings. This induces a voltage in rotor (of
transformer) by mutual induction. As the flux pattern is same the voltage induced in
transformer is maximum when both the rotors are in same position (direction). The voltage
induced is zero, when the rotor of transmitter is perpendicular with respect to transformer
rotor. If ‘θ’ is the angle as shown in Fig. 8.55, then the induced voltage Vi = Ve sin θ, where,
Ve – excitation voltage. It is constant for given instrument.
∴
sin θ =

for small values of ‘θ’, sin θ = θ . ∴ θ =

V . Since Ve is constant, θ ∝ Vi. The induced
voltage in transformer rotor is directly proportional to angular displacement (for small ‘θ’).

It basically works on differential transformer principle. So, either transformer or
transmitter can be fixed for reference and the other can be connected to rotating body
for angular measurement purpose.
Application Example
1. Machinetool
2. Servomechanisms
3. Aircraft gyro compass measurements
4. Load positioning.
8.14 RESOLVER
Construction
It is also working based on rotating transformer principle. It resembles two-phase alternators
in magnetics and windings. The two-phase windings are 90° to each other. In the dumb-
bell shaped rotor, the third winding is wound and electric connections are through slip
rings and brushes.
Working
The rotor winding is excited with a constant voltage at some frequency ‘ω’. The current
through the coil produces a varying flux and induces voltage in the stator windings. When
the rotor is as shown in Fig. 8.57 (vertical position) stator links maximum flux with stator
windings ‘P1’ and zero flux with windings ‘P2’. The e.m.f. induced in ‘P1’ is maximum and
that of ‘P2’ is zero. When the rotor is in horizontal position, it induces maximum e.m.f. in
winding ‘P2’ and zero e.m.f. in ‘P1’ winding. As the stator moves from vertical to horizontal,
the e.m.f. induced in stator ‘P1’ varies as a cosine function of ‘θ’. ‘θ’ is shown in the
Fig. 8.57 and that of stator ‘P2’ varies as a sine of ‘θ’. Exciting voltage for rotor
Ve = a × sin ωt
Where,
a - amplitude
ω - Frequency
Induced voltage in stator ‘P1’ = Ve × cosθ and P2 = Ve × sin θ

Strain Measurement
191
For many metals, the resistivity does not vary with strain, i.e., the Piezo-resistive term
is vanishing small, and then the gauge factor is a function of Poisson ratio only:
F = 1 + 2σ
It is apparent from the result that for any given value of the original gauge resistance
and the unit strain, the change in resistance will vary directly with the gauge factor. Hence
the magnitude of gauge factor indicates the sensitivity of the gauge. A high gauge factor is
desirable because that would give a large change in resistance for a given strain input,
thereby necessitating less sensitive readout circuitry. It is worthwhile to mention that for
most commercial strain gauges the value of gauge factor is same for both tensile and
compressive strains.
9.8 WHEATSTONE BRIDGE
Wheatstone bridge is the simplest circuit used for measuring the change in resistance. Note
that it is not just resistance but change in resistance. It consists of a galvanometer and 4
resistance arms as shown in Fig. 9.9. The strain gauge is connected to one of these 4 arms
as resistive element. The excitation source can be DC or DC If the source is AC then any
combination of resistor, capacitor and inductor can be used as the circuit element. But id
it is DC source, then only resistor can be used. Initially, the bridge circuit is balanced when
there is no strain. The galvanometer will read zero reading. Meaning the following ratio is
true.

When there is a change in anyone/ combination of resistances, which will break the
above relation, then the unbalanced voltage will be read by the galvanometer.

Force Measurement

other, the magnetic flux lines around the windings do not influence each other. Hence the
output is zero.
When the force to be measured is applied, the laminated load bearing column is
stressed. The permeability of the column becomes non-uniform and changes the magnetic
flux pattern. The magnetic lines cut each other and induce a voltage in the secondary
winding. The voltage induced is proportional to the applied force. After calibration, force
can be directly read from the display unit.
Application
It is widely used in steel plants to measure roll-force in rolling mills, strip tension in strip
mills and weighing cranes in steel-melting shops.
Advantages
1. It can withstand overloads about 10 times the rated load.
2. It is extremely robust transducer.
3. The output signal level is very high.
Disadvantages
1. It has hystersis errors.
2. It is affected by temperature variations.
3. Overloading and ageing may cause permanent drift.
11.14 REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. Define force.
2. Distinguish weight and mass.
3. State classification of force measuring instruments.
4. What is fixed mode and variable mode in equal arm balance?
5. Describe principle, construction and working along with advantages of hydraulic load
cell.
6. Explain difference between hydraulic and pneumatic load cell based on its construction
and working.
7. What is “back pressure” and “corrugated diaphragm”?
8. Explain alternate arrangement of pneumatic loads cell.
9. Explain the working and construction of spring balance load cells.
10. What is strain gauge and describe about column type strain gauge load cells?
11. Explain proving ring as a force transducer.
12. Explain LVDT type load cell.
13. Describe about electromagnetic balance.
14. What is digital force transducer? Explain its working.

Instrumentation and Control Systems
where,
Cd – drag co-efficient
A – Cross section area
( – Mass density of fluid
V – Velocity of fluid.
Working Principle
For a flow with sufficiently high Reynolds number and a properly shaped immersed body
with constant fluid density, the drag force on immersed body is directly proportional to
square of velocity of fluid.
Strain gage
Fig. 14.34. Drag-force Flow Meter
Construction
There is a pipe of diameter same as line diameter. Perpendicular to the axis of the pipe,
there is a tube, which encomposes a cantilever beam, and a drag body. The walls of
cantilever beam are made very thin to increase sensitivity. The drag body is completely
immersed in the flowing fluid and will experience a drag force. Strain gauges are placed
in the cantilever beam to measure the deflection due to drag force. This becomes a measure
of fluid velocity. wheatstone bridge is used to measure change in resistance of strain
gauges.
Working
Drag force flow meter is fitted in the line where the fluid velocity is to be measured. Due
to fluid velocity, the drag body will experience a drag force proportional to the square of
velocity. The cantilever beam gets deflected due to drag force and undergoes elastic
deformation. The strain gauge will measure this deformation and gives proportional voltage
signal. Suitable linearization and square root circuits are used in signal conditioning unit
and processed signal is displaced in display unit.
