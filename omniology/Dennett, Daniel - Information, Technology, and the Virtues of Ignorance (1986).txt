Information, Technology, and the 
Virtues 
of Ignorance 
When 
I was 
about 
ten 
years 
old, 
I read Robinson 
Crusoe for the first time and could scarcely contain my 
delight with the ingenious and resourceful ways Crusoe 
transformed his island world, 
bending its inventory to his own 
purposes, surrounding himself with contrivances of his own design 
and manufacture 
for enhancing his powers, and providing for his 
safety, 
nourishment, 
and pleasure. 
I discovered 
right 
then that I was 
in love with 
technology, 
as no doubt many 
of you 
are. We 
should 
recognize?we 
technophiles?that 
our 
love affair with 
technology, 
like all good 
love affairs, 
is not 
entirely 
rational, 
try as we may 
to 
rationalize 
our devotions. 
Crusoe 
the technocrat?it 
is one 
of 
the 
great 
fantasy 
themes, 
right up there with 
sexual 
adventure, 
athletic 
triumph, being able to fly, being invisible. It rivals them all in its 
captivation, 
in the luxuriousness 
of its details 
in our minds' 
eyes. 
It is 
far more 
satisfying 
than magic, 
precisely 
because 
it is not magic; 
it is 
something 
we 
create, 
and hence 
are presumably 
responsible 
for; it is 
something 
we 
understand, 
presumably, 
and 
hence, 
presumably, 
control. 
We 
live today in a wonderful world 
in which 
the fantasy of 
unlimited 
technological 
enhancement 
seems 
to be coming 
true. This 
is convenient 
for us 
technophiles, 
for we 
can point 
to the many 
blessings 
our 
loved one has provided 
for us all?even 
the ingrates. 
Which technophobe would choose to live the harrowing and desper 
ate life of the medieval peasant or the Stone Age hunter? Yet, like 
Crusoe, 
we 
pay 
some 
price 
for whatever 
we 
gain, 
requiring 
some

Daniel 
C. Dennett 
minor 
revision 
in our habits, 
some 
curtailing 
of our options, 
some 
petty 
irritations 
that crop up as side effects with 
the adoption 
of each 
new marvel. Some find it easy to push these slightly nagging debits 
into the background; 
they say "Yes, 
there are costs of course, 
but 
it's 
not worth 
our while 
trying 
to sum 
them?whatever 
they come 
to, 
they are a small price 
to pay 
for the obvious 
gains." 
Others 
find their 
uneasiness 
harder 
to quell; 
they wonder 
if, when 
the total 
costs 
of 
some of the more 
indirect 
effects of new 
technology 
are rendered, 
we 
may not find that we have moved imperceptibly into a world we do 
not know 
how 
to inhabit 
and cannot 
leave. 
I propose 
to focus 
attention 
on certain 
troubling 
aspects 
of 
this 
relationship between technology and morality.11 wish to consider the 
possibility that information technology, which has been a great boon 
in the past, 
is today 
poised 
to ruin our 
lives?unless 
we 
are able 
to 
think up some fairly radical departures from the traditions that have 
so far sustained 
us. 
We 
all want 
to lead good 
lives?in 
at least two senses. We 
want 
to 
lead lives that are interesting, exciting, fulfilling, and happy, and we 
want to lead lives that are morally good as well: we would like to be 
useful, 
and 
to make 
a difference?a 
difference 
in the right direction, 
whatever direction that is. There is no doubt that technology in the 
past has 
facilitated 
both 
these aspirations, 
freeing 
us from drudgery 
and misery, 
making 
it possible 
for many 
of us to improve 
the lives of 
others. 
But unless we 
can find solutions 
to certain 
problems, 
the curve 
will 
turn. We 
have 
reached 
a point where 
the advance 
of technology 
makes 
the joint 
realization 
of 
these 
two 
goals 
less likely?we 
may 
have 
to make 
an unpalatable 
choice 
between 
lives that are morally 
good, 
and 
lives that are interesting. 
Since my message 
is one that many 
may 
find unpalatable, 
it may 
be 
useful 
for me 
to start with 
a very 
specific 
instance 
of the trend 
that 
concerns 
me, 
before 
drawing 
on 
it for wider 
implications. 
As 
technology 
imposes 
new 
sources 
of knowledge, 
it renders 
obsolete 
the standards that guided our individual actions in the past. Consider, 
for example, 
the case of the rural doctor. 
Today, 
there are doctors 
who 
have 
chosen, 
commendably, 
to 
forsake 
lucrative 
urban 
or 
suburban 
practices 
for more 
valuable 
and meaningful 
lives as doctors 
in small rural communities. 
Their 
virtues 
have often 
been 
sung;2 
there 
is little need for me to dwell on them. These doctors know their 
patients 
well; 
their personal, 
intricate, 
involved 
knowledge

them 
in good 
stead when 
they come 
to diagnose, 
treat, and advise 
the 
members 
of their communities. 
Such 
doctors, 
for better 
or worse, 
are an 
endangered 
species. 
Technology 
is on 
the verge 
of 
rendering 
their 
style 
of medical 
treatment 
obsolete, 
and?because 
of its obsolescence?morally 
inde 
fensible. 
As 
expert 
systems 
for medical 
diagnosis 
become 
available, 
these doctors will have to decide whether to avail themselves of the 
new 
technology. 
Let us suppose, 
for the sake of argument, 
that the 
systems will work 
as well 
as their supporters 
claim; 
they really will 
provide 
swift, 
reliable, 
and accurate 
diagnoses 
of ailments 
across 
the 
wide 
spectrum 
of medical 
cases 
the average 
physician 
is likely 
to 
encounter. 
If so, the doctors, 
in good 
conscience, 
will 
have no choice: 
they will 
have 
to avail 
themselves 
of the new 
expert 
systems. 
To 
choose 
not 
to 
equip 
themselves 
with 
the best available 
means 
of securing 
accurate 
diagnosis 
would 
be a gross 
dereliction 
of duty, 
just as if?for 
some 
romantic 
whim?they 
chose 
to deny 
themselves 
use of a telephone, 
or 
insisted 
on making 
their rounds 
on horseback, 
or refused 
to consult 
x-rays 
before 
operating. 
Quaintness 
is acceptable 
when 
matters 
of life 
and death 
are not 
at stake; 
but 
few would 
be enthusiastic 
about 
a 
doctor 
who 
insisted 
on relying 
on old-fashioned 
methods, 
particu 
larly if it entailed a serious and avoidable risk of misdiagnosis or 
mistreatment. 
Doctors 
have 
always 
been 
obliged 
to keep 
up-to-date 
with 
their 
medicine, 
and typically 
have 
responded 
to this obligation 
with 
fairly 
serious 
efforts 
to stay abreast 
of medical 
journals, 
to take refresher 
courses. 
The 
generation 
of information 
has recently 
been getting 
out 
of hand; 
until now, 
rural doctors 
have 
been 
excused 
from knowing 
everything 
that 
their urban 
colleagues 
were 
held 
responsible 
for? 
there are limits 
to what 
people 
can be expected 
to carry around 
in 
their heads. 
Now, 
however, 
a technology 
is promised 
that will 
render 
such 
limits obsolete. All you will have to do is install a modem and a 
cellular 
telephone 
in your 
four-wheel-drive 
van 
and 
there, 
at your 
fingertips, will be a credible approximation of the finest corps of 
specialist 
consultants, 
available 
twenty-four 
hours 
a day. You would 
have 
to take a curious moral 
stand 
indeed 
to resist becoming 
reliant 
on such a system. How 
dare you 
turn your back on such a fine new 
source 
of 
information, 
when 
lives?lives 
entrusted 
to you?depend

on 
you 
making 
the best 
informed 
diagnoses 
of which 
you 
are 
capable? 
The 
standards 
of excusable 
ignorance 
for even the most 
isolated 
of 
rural doctors will shift, and the doctors will be required to alter their 
practices 
to meet wholly 
new 
standards. 
All doctors 
will 
be expected 
to avail 
themselves 
of the new 
technology, 
just as all doctors 
now 
are 
required 
to maintain 
standards 
of 
antiseptic 
practice. 
We 
may 
suppose 
that expert 
systems 
will 
enable 
doctors 
to practice 
much 
better medicine, 
but 
in order 
to use 
these 
systems 
they will 
have 
to 
relinquish 
some practices 
they may well 
have 
prized 
in their earlier 
modus 
operandi. 
At 
present, 
rural doctors 
can 
take 
a varied, 
even 
informal, 
ap 
proach to gathering facts about their patients. If old Sam looks OK, 
sounds 
just about 
the way 
he always 
sounds 
at this time of year, 
and 
does 
not 
complain 
about 
anything 
new, 
the doctor 
can 
leave well 
enough alone. Besides, if there really is anything new wrong with old 
Sam, 
it is too esoteric, 
or too obscure 
at this stage, 
for the rural doctor 
to be expected 
to diagnose 
it. After 
all, rural medicine 
is not 
the 
Massachusetts 
General 
Hospital. 
But expert 
systems will 
change 
all 
this. Doctors will be obliged to ask all their patients a battery of 
questions 
they never 
felt the need 
to ask before?for 
what 
use could 
they have made 
of the answers? 
They will also be obliged to perform a variety of largely simple 
tests they never 
felt bound 
to perform 
before. 
They will 
do so because 
the feeding of expert systems with such data will supposedly have 
proven 
to bear 
valuable 
results?permitting 
a higher 
rate of 
early 
diagnosis 
of treatable 
cancer, 
for instance. 
Gathering 
information 
by 
these 
two methods?asking 
questions 
and performing 
simple 
tests? 
will 
be made 
as 
easy, 
straightforward, 
unequivocal 
as possible. 
Indeed, 
the procedure 
will 
be as routine 
as possible, 
for the more 
routine 
it is, the more 
uniform 
the feeding 
of the expert 
systems will 
be, and hence the less likelihood there will be of misinforming them. 
In this way, 
the "art" 
of diagnosis, 
and 
the "art" 
of "taking 
a 
patient's 
history" 
will 
be reduced, 
as far as possible, 
to an exercise 
in 
which the art is displaced by the mere capacity to follow directions. 
I am not claiming 
that such systems would 
place 
a positive 
value 
on 
the deliberate 
suppression 
of 
imaginative, 
artful 
investigation 
and 
diagnosis, 
but 
just that such activities 
would 
be relegated

room remained after the doctors had done their duty by asking all the 
obligatory questions and performing all the obligatory tests. 
Since "progress" in medicine (and technology generally) proceeds 
by replacing 
art with 
obligatory 
practices 
whenever 
the principles 
governing the art can be well enough understood and justified to be 
codified, 
we 
can expect 
that, 
insofar 
as the technology 
of medical 
diagnosis 
succeeds, 
insofar 
as it becomes 
so demonstrably 
reliable 
that doctors will be obliged to use it, it will do so by diminishing the 
regular, 
daily 
contribution 
of the medical 
practitioners 
who 
use 
it. 
Once in a while, the artful doctor may find a moment 
in which to 
exercise his or her art, and even save a life by filling a gap in the 
technology, 
but such opportunities 
will 
become 
rarer as the technol 
ogy 
improves. 
A 
subspecies 
of doctor 
will 
thus become 
extinct, 
succeeded 
by a 
new 
species 
that will 
delegate 
more 
and more 
diagnostic 
responsibil 
ity to expert 
systems, 
not because 
of their indolence 
or stupidity, 
but 
simply because they will not be able to defend the claim that they can 
do as well 
or better without 
the systems. 
Should we mourn the passing of this species of practitioner? If we 
adopt 
the doctors' 
own point 
of view, we 
can see why 
they might 
well 
regret this development: it will make their own lives less exciting, less 
indispensable; they will begin to sink into the role of mere go 
betweens, 
living 
interfaces 
between 
patient 
and system, who 
consol 
idate their direct 
observations 
into machine-readable 
symptomatol 
ogy, 
and execute 
the therapeutic 
directives 
of the system. 
It may 
help us to conceive 
of their predicament 
if we 
imagine 
their 
secret yearnings: 
they will 
occasionally 
be tempted 
to "live danger 
ously," 
to "fly by the seat of their pants," 
to take risks with 
their 
patients' 
lives just to prove 
to themselves 
that they still have 
the "right 
stuff"?that 
they can make 
bare-handed 
diagnoses 
as well 
as the best 
of the old-time 
doctors, 
the swashbuckling 
specialists 
of the 1970s 
and 
'80s. The more 
adventurous 
(or self-indulgent) 
of them may 
seek 
out 
the few exotic 
environments 
where 
they can practice 
medicine 
free from the obligation to use the boring technology?much 
the way 
some like to "rough it" by going camping, or by sailing small boats 
across 
the ocean. 
Yet, 
thanks 
to communication 
satellites, 
even 
Robinson Crusoe's island will provide no asylum for the physician 
who 
seeks refuge 
from expert 
systems. 
Being 
a doctor 
simply won't 
be anywhere 
near as much 
fun in the future.

Daniel 
C. Dennett 
This 
extinction 
of 
social 
roles 
is a familiar 
process 
in history. 
Artists, 
calligraphers, 
potters, 
and tailors used 
to be more 
indispens 
able to their communities 
than they are now. Although 
there still is a 
role for such artists, 
it is a luxury 
role; some people 
are willing 
to pay 
extra 
for that special, personal, 
artistic 
touch?but 
the realm 
in which 
the hand-made 
is superior 
to the machine-made 
has 
shrunk 
to an 
almost 
purely 
ceremonial, 
even mystical 
remnant 
of its former 
status. 
Fortunately 
for potters, 
there 
are still enough 
people 
who 
prize 
hand-made 
pottery 
so that it is possible 
to sustain 
a career as a potter, 
but the social position of the potter has been ineluctably damaged; 
potters 
are simply 
no 
longer 
indispensable 
as they once were. While 
being a potter is still a good life compared with most others?it has 
more than its share of satisfactions and delights?it 
is not as fulfilling 
a life as it used 
to be, since any reflective 
potter must 
recognize 
that 
he or she survives by gratifying the desires of a rarified subset of the 
population. Doctors will not even be that lucky, for who in his right 
mind would 
acquire 
a taste for funky, hand-made 
medical 
care?just 
like Grandma used to get? 
No doubt the rich and foolish would recognize a certain cachet in 
keeping 
a personal?and 
personable?physician 
in their entourage. 
Compare the doctor of the future with the apartment doorman. This 
descendant 
of 
the concierge, 
who 
had 
a relatively 
challenging 
and 
varied 
life work, 
has 
an almost 
purely 
ceremonial 
function 
today. 
You 
can 
telephone 
for a taxi with 
greater 
ease 
than your 
obliging 
doorman 
can 
lure one 
to the door, 
and 
the security 
he provides 
is 
typically 
almost 
redundant, 
given 
the twenty-four-hour 
surveillance 
and alarm 
system. 
But 
it looks nice 
to have 
a doorman. 
He 
adds 
a 
personal 
touch?of 
sorts. 
It is posh 
to 
live somewhere 
that 
is so 
well-heeled that it can afford to pay a grown human being to stand 
around in a uniform smiling all day. The doorman's 
life is not 
pleasant 
to contemplate; 
it is a travesty 
of human 
service, 
however 
well 
reimbursed. 
Every 
doctor must 
begin 
to worry 
that he or she is heading 
towards 
becoming 
a health-care 
doorman. 
Can 
it be that, 
in a future 
gener 
ation, all that will be left of today's doctor will be minimal "computer 
literacy" 
and a bedside 
manner? 
The 
advocates 
of expert 
systems 
in medicine 
may wish 
to intervene 
here, pointing out that, far from diminishing the life of the physician, 
expert 
systems will 
enhance 
it. The physician 
will 
have more 
time to

deal 
personally 
with 
patients, 
and 
can 
care 
effectively 
for greater 
numbers, 
because 
the drudgery 
and 
galling 
uncertainty 
of poring 
through 
textbooks 
and 
journals 
for 
snatches 
of half-remembered 
wisdom 
will 
be eliminated. 
Indeed, 
and today's 
apartment 
doorman 
can 
"deal 
personally" 
with 
ten times 
as many 
inhabitants 
as the 
old-fashioned 
concierge, 
since 
all the drudgery 
has 
been 
removed 
from his life as well. The doorman has certainly been relieved of such 
menial 
labor, 
but 
also 
of 
responsibility, 
variety 
of 
challenge, 
and 
autonomy. Like the Cheshire cat, all that is left is the smile. As the 
responsibility for diagnosis and treatment shifts imperceptibly away 
from 
the physician?the 
"field operative"?and 
lodges 
in the expert 
system 
(or system 
of expert 
systems), 
doctors 
will 
suffer a similar, 
if 
less drastic, 
diminution 
of role. 
I am not 
for one minute 
maintaining 
that today's 
rural doctors 
are 
heroes, 
and 
that 
their 
sad 
fate 
is the 
result 
of 
evil, 
rapacious 
technocrats 
seducing 
them 
from 
their noble 
lives. Greed 
and 
evil 
intentions 
do not 
enter 
this equation?though 
they are not 
in short 
supply. 
It is precisely 
because 
doctors 
want 
to practice 
the best 
medicine they can that they will find it incumbent on them to make 
these choices; for they will see that they will actually be able to save 
lives more 
reliably and efficiently by availing themselves of the 
technology. The interesting and risky life they had been leading will 
no longer be morally defensible. Wanting to be responsible and to do 
good, 
they will 
have 
to settle for a less exciting 
service 
role. We 
may 
suppose 
equally 
pure and altruistic 
motives 
on the part of those who 
design, 
develop, 
and promote 
the technology. 
They 
do not 
intend 
to 
spoil 
career 
opportunities; 
it is simply 
one 
of 
the foreseeable 
side 
effects of their effort to do a better job of saving lives through 
technology. 
What 
I am referring 
to is not a cheap melodrama 
with 
a 
convenient 
villain 
at which 
I can shake my 
finger, 
but more 
in the 
nature 
of a tragedy. 
In a tragedy, 
the hero's 
ultimate 
fate must 
be seen to be inevitable; 
that is one reason why I hesitate to call this a tragedy. If I thought that 
this unhappy d?nouement were strictly inevitable, I would perhaps 
have 
decided 
to keep 
the grim 
news 
to myself. 
How, 
then, might 
some 
alternative 
future 
await 
the physicians? 
First, 
the technology 
of expert 
systems may 
turn out not 
to work 
all that well. We may discover that expert systems are so limited and 
unreliable, taken by themselves, that doctors will still have to be very

self-reliant,

knowledgeable 
individually, 
very 
artful 
in the use 
they make of technology. Perhaps they will not even be obliged to use 
it, so untrustworthy 
will 
it prove 
to be. 
(In several

with 
advocates 
of such technology 
I have been amused

solemnly, 
that I have vastly 
overestimated 
the actual powers

These 
spokespeople 
for expert 
systems 
have 
failed 
to see the 
irony 
in their protestations: 
"Don't 
worry!" 
they say. "These 
expert 
systems 
aren't 
going 
to be reliable!?they 
won't 
be foolproof! 
Why, 
in the hands of an unskilled practitioner they would be positively 
dangerous!" 
I am strongly 
inclined 
to agree, 
but 
to suggest 
that 
to 
them would 
be to risk being dismissed as a technology-hating 
humanist.) 
We 
have 
found 
one 
escape 
route: 
this particular 
technology 
will 
not work after all, and hence will not be obligatory, and hence will 
not spread to destroy this enviable and admirable variety of human 
life. There 
are 
several 
other 
ways 
out. 
If one 
thought 
that 
the 
technology might work, and thought that preserving the way of life 
of today's 
physician 
was 
of prime 
importance, 
one could 
take steps to 
avert this future: either by the Luddite tactic of destroying expert 
systems 
as they appeared; 
or by attempting 
to prohibit 
or prevent 
the 
development 
and 
improvement 
of the technology 
in the first place. 
But Luddism 
has never worked 
well 
in the past. 
It tends 
to postpone 
crises 
and 
aggravate 
situations, 
and 
is in any 
event 
not 
likely 
to 
inspire 
those who 
would 
have 
to support 
the policy 
today. 
Alternatively, 
it may 
turn 
out 
that 
I have 
overestimated 
the 
physicians' 
commitment 
to practicing 
the best medicine 
they 
can. 
According 
to several 
observers, 
many 
doctors 
have 
given 
the new 
expert 
systems 
a lukewarm 
reception 
largely because 
they are more 
interested 
in "talking 
shop" 
with 
consultants, 
and 
in spreading 
liability, 
than 
in obtaining 
diagnostic 
assistance. 
If such resistance 
is 
widespread, 
it may 
prevent 
the public 
from perceiving 
the value 
of 
expert 
systems, 
and 
thereby 
keep 
the obligation 
to use 
them at bay. 
Finally, of course, one could decide that saving the role of the 
mid-twentieth-century 
physician 
was, 
in the end, no more 
defensible 
than 
saving 
the role of the 
linotype 
operator 
in the production 
of 
newspapers. 
These 
roles must 
pass, 
perhaps, 
and as long as we 
ease 
the plight of the current holders of the positions, and prevent the 
recruitment 
of a new 
generation, 
little harm will 
be done

143 
individuals. 
People 
in the future will 
just have other, 
no doubt 
better, 
occupations. 
While 
that sentiment 
has a certain 
plausibility 
when 
the displaced 
workers 
are miners, 
linotype 
operators, 
or secretaries, 
it is far from 
clear what exalted work will remain for displaced physicians. If a 
social 
role 
as obviously 
valuable 
and 
impressive 
as 
that 
of 
the 
physician is in jeopardy, what future awaits the rest of us?3 
Let us review 
the situation: 
if expert 
systems 
in medicine 
live up to 
their 
promise, 
then 
the 
tradition 
and 
the 
current 
trajectory 
of 
development 
suggest 
that they will 
probably 
ruin one 
of 
the most 
exciting and fulfilling careers in modern life. Without 
destroying it, 
they will diminish it enormously; people who want to live a good 
life?not 
just do good in life?will 
think twice before entering this 
part of the service 
sector. 
Perhaps 
the role of physician 
is not worth 
preserving. 
Alternatively, 
perhaps 
expert 
systems will 
not prove 
all 
that powerful, so that physicians will not be obliged to cede their 
responsibility to them. Or, in the hope that expert systems will fail to 
establish 
themselves, 
we might 
even 
take steps, violent 
or legislative, 
to forestall their deployment. 
I see two further possibilities. The first and most probable outcome 
is that we 
shall be faced with the worst of both worlds: 
expert 
systems will 
not work 
anywhere 
near well 
enough 
for physicians 
to 
be obliged to rely on them, but the physicians will come to depend on 
them anyway, 
succumbing 
to the pressure 
of over-optimistic 
public 
opinion, 
their 
lack of self-confidence, 
and even 
laziness, 
greed, 
and 
fear of malpractice 
suits. A 
second 
somewhat 
Utopian 
possibility 
is 
certainly worth 
striving 
for: perhaps we 
can design 
computer 
systems 
to support 
only 
the wily 
and 
self-reliant 
physician. 
We 
should 
look 
for design principles that would lead to the creation of systems that 
preserve or (better yet) enhance the contribution of the individual 
physician, while not sacrificing diagnostic power. I do not think that 
creating such systems is impossible, but it will not be easy; it will 
require rethinking the basic design task. 
Compare 
expert 
systems 
to musical 
instruments: 
today's 
expert 
systems 
are similar 
to autoharps, 
designed 
so that anyone 
can learn to 
play them, and with an easily reached plateau of skill. We should aim 
instead 
to develop 
systems more 
like violins 
and pianos?instruments 
that indefinitely extend and challenge the powers of the individual.

Daniel 
C. Dennett 
I have 
some 
inklings 
about 
how 
this might 
be accomplished. 
They 
stem from 
ideas I have been developing 
at Tufts' 
Curricular 
Software 
Studio with 
my 
colleague, 
George 
Smith.4 We 
are creating 
several 
different kinds of "concept pianos" for the exploration of complex 
phenomena?such 
as population 
genetics 
and 
the computer's 
own 
internal 
architecture. 
If our 
ideas 
survive 
their 
current 
testing, 
we 
shall 
subsequently 
present 
them 
as 
steps 
towards 
a new 
design 
philosophy 
for expert systems, but in the meanwhile 
there is still 
plenty of philosophical work to be done on these issues, to which I 
shall devote 
my 
remaining 
observations. 
Why should doctors find themselves riding this obligation-train to 
tedium? 
To 
understand 
this particular 
phenomenon, 
we must 
step 
back 
and 
take a more 
general 
view 
of the relations 
between 
infor 
mation 
technology 
and our ethical 
lives as decision-making 
agents. 
Our 
ancestors 
were, 
relative 
to us, 
epistemically 
impoverished: 
there were 
few means 
of finding 
out much 
about 
non-local, 
non 
immediate 
effects 
and problems, 
so they could 
plan 
and act with 
a 
clear conscience 
on the basis of a more 
limited, manageable 
stock of 
local knowledge. They were thus capable of living lives of virtue?of 
a virtue 
that depended 
on unavoidable 
ignorance. 
Modern 
technol 
ogy has robbed us of the sorts of virtue that depend on such 
ignorance, 
for 
ignorance 
is all 
too 
avoidable 
today. 
Information 
technology 
has multiplied 
our 
opportunities 
to know, 
and 
our 
traditional 
ethical 
doctrines 
overwhelm 
us by turning 
these opportu 
nities 
into newfound 
obligations 
to know. 
We 
have 
always 
had "principles 
of excusable 
ignorance." 
Accord 
ing to tradition, 
we 
are responsible 
for knowing 
whatever 
is "com 
mon 
knowledge," 
plus whatever 
is the received wisdom 
of those who 
occupy 
our 
specialized 
social 
role?such 
as the role of physician? 
plus whatever 
is obviously 
and 
directly 
relevant 
to our particular 
circumstances 
of the moment. 
We 
are all responsible 
for knowing 
the 
standardly 
understood 
relationships 
between 
smoke 
and fire, 
rain 
storms 
and 
slippery 
roads, 
voting 
and democracy. 
Plumbers?but 
only 
plumbers?have 
been 
responsible 
for knowing 
the particular 
effects, 
opportunities, 
and 
hazards 
of 
the plumbing 
trade, 
and 
everyone 
is responsible 
for knowing 
whether 
anyone 
is standing 
behind one's car before backing out of a parking place. 
The 
rough-hewn 
boundaries 
of 
these 
classes 
of knowledge 
were 
fixed by default by the limitations of human capacity. One could not

145 
be expected 
to carry around 
vast quantities 
of information 
in one's 
head, 
nor 
to calculate, 
in the time available, 
any of the longer-range 
effects of action. The example of the physician showed in some detail 
how 
technology 
interacts with 
the obligation 
to know 
in a specialized 
field, 
but 
its effects 
on "common 
knowledge" 
are even more 
severe 
and 
imponderable. 
"Common 
knowledge" 
is no 
longer 
the relatively 
stable, 
inertial 
mass 
it once was. We 
can acquire 
knowledge 
with 
little effort 
on 
almost 
any topic; when 
knowledge 
is "at your fingertips," 
how 
can 
you not be responsible for acquiring it? The obligation to know?a 
burden of guilt that weighs heavily on every academic, but that in 
milder 
forms 
is ubiquitous 
today?creates 
the situation 
where, 
if we 
read 
everything 
we 
"ought" 
to read, we 
would 
have 
time 
to do 
nothing 
else. Thanks 
to science 
and mass 
communication, 
we 
all now 
know 
that, 
in addition 
to worrying 
about 
whether 
someone 
is 
standing 
behind 
our car when 
we 
back up, we 
also have 
to wonder 
about 
the effects 
of our 
personal 
auto-driving 
(and auto-buying) 
activities 
on air pollution, 
acid 
rain, 
the local and global 
economy, 
and 
so forth.5 
The well-known 
glut of information has inspired a host of re 
sponses 
from those who must 
cope with 
it, or wish 
to exploit 
it. Since 
everyone 
knows 
that no one 
can possibly 
keep 
abreast 
of all this 
information, 
meta-techniques, 
meta-strategies, 
meta-meta-structures, 
meta-meta-meta-tactics 
have 
arisen. The 
"common 
knowledge" 
we 
are now 
held 
responsible 
for 
is not 
the whole 
of what 
is almost 
instantaneously 
available 
to almost 
everyone, 
but 
rather 
a small, 
shifting 
core of what 
might 
be called 
"temporarily 
famous" 
common 
knowledge. 
(Recall Andy Warhol's 
prediction of the future time 
when 
each person 
will 
be famous 
for ten minutes.) 
Getting 
items of 
information 
into the spotlight 
of temporary 
fame has become 
a major 
enterprise. Whether 
your problem 
is the eradication 
of Third World 
hunger, the deposition of an evil dictator, stopping the Star Wars 
lunacy, 
or selling 
cornflakes, 
your 
solution 
must 
begin with 
"adver 
tising"?attracting 
the fleeting 
attention 
of the well-intentioned, 
and 
imposing 
that item of information 
on them. 
So much information is available that mere accessibility is no better 
than invisibility. Most 
books that are published are not read, and 
even being read does not guarantee their influence. This depends on 
higher-order effects: a book must not only be reviewed, but (thanks

to the reviews) 
be included 
on an influential 
list of books 
to be read, 
for example. If it achieves sufficient visibility in the higher-order 
structures, 
it need 
not 
even 
be 
read 
to have 
vast 
influence. 
This 
profusion of information filters, duplicators, and amplifiers is the 
product 
of helter-skelter 
competition, 
and 
there 
is little 
reason 
to 
suppose 
such 
a process 
is even 
approximately 
optimizing. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
there is probably 
scant direct 
relationship 
between 
the value 
of items of information and their capacity to exploit the publicity 
environment 
and reproduce 
themselves 
across 
the society. 
Richard Dawkins' excellent book, The Selfish Gene, introduces the 
idea of what he calls m?mes?a 
"new kind of replicator" living in 
"the 
soup of human 
culture." M?mes 
are, to a first approximation, 
ideas in particular forms?the 
sort of thing one might be able to 
patent 
or copyright: 
Examples 
of m?mes 
are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, 
clothes 
fashions, ways 
of making 
pots or of building 
arches. Just as genes propagate 
themselves 
in 
the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperm or eggs, so m?mes 
propagate 
themselves 
in the m?me 
pool by leaping from brain to brain via 
a process which, 
in the broad 
sense, can be called imitation.6 
The 
analogy 
between 
m?mes 
and 
genes 
runs 
deep, 
as Dawkins 
shows. 
Recasting 
my 
argument 
in his terms, my 
claim 
is that, thanks 
to some 
technological 
m?mes, 
we 
have 
entered 
a population 
explo 
sion of m?mes?parasites 
that are overwhelming 
their hosts. 
Unless 
we 
can find some new 
ideas, some antibodies 
for these new 
antigens, 
hard 
times are in store for us. The new m?mes 
we 
need are conceptual 
innovations, 
not 
just new 
technology. 
It is technology 
that has 
created 
this 
embarrassment 
of 
riches. 
Consider, 
in this respect, 
our obligations 
to those 
in misery 
on other 
planets. 
It is quite possible 
that there 
is life elsewhere 
in the universe, 
and if there is life there is almost certainly misery as well. Fortunately 
for us, however, 
the most 
shocking 
and gruesome 
calamities 
on other 
planets?plagues, 
dictatorships, 
nuclear 
holocausts?are 
nothing 
to 
us, because 
even 
if we 
knew 
about 
them 
(which, 
fortunately 
for our 
peace of mind, we do not) there would be absolutely nothing we 
could 
do about 
them. Perhaps 
we 
should 
be wary 
about 
proceeding 
with 
the project 
Carl 
Sagan 
champions 
of 
trying 
to communicate 
with 
the civilizations 
on other planets; 
after all, we might 
succeed 
and 
find that their first message 
to us was 
a heart-rending 
plea 
for help?

together with detailed information on just how we could be of 
assistance!7 
Not 
long ago, measured 
by the astronomical 
or even the biological 
time scale, 
the Western 
Hemisphere 
was 
as remote 
from 
the Eastern 
as any planet 
is from us now. 
Even well 
into the nineteenth 
century, 
few people had the knowledge and power to have any clear obliga 
tions to anyone or anything beyond their local communities. The 
average 
person 
could 
not 
reasonably 
expect 
to have much 
effect on 
the lives of those in distant lands, and hence was absolved from 
worrying 
about 
them. 
Such questions 
just did not 
arise?any 
more 
than 
the question 
of what 
to do 
about 
starvation 
in other 
solar 
systems 
arises 
for us. 
A few people of enhanced power and knowledge found, however, 
that they could not hide behind their powerlessness. Their attitude 
was captured in the slogan noblesse oblige?those 
of noble birth had 
special obligations.8 While the slogan applied originally only to the 
titled few, the idea was subsequently extended to all those who had 
power, inherited or otherwise acquired. The price they paid for their 
"noblesse," 
in the extended 
sense 
of not 
having 
to devote 
their 
waking hours to providing daily bread and shelter, was an enlarged 
social 
purpose. 
In the nineteenth 
century, 
every well-read 
person 
could ask whether he or she should become fully committed to 
ending slavery, for instance, and many decided they should. Their 
efforts 
succeeded 
in practically 
eradicating 
slavery. 
Others 
took on different 
causes, with 
varying 
degrees 
of success. 
It 
is often noted 
how 
curious 
and sometimes 
eccentric 
the focus of such 
people's 
moral 
sensitivities 
can 
be; 
both 
then 
and 
now. 
Some 
anti-slavery 
crusaders 
were 
strikingly 
oblivious 
of 
the suffering 
of 
their own 
poor, 
the degradation 
of their own 
servants, 
the exploita 
tion of 
the workers 
in their 
factories. 
Today 
single-minded 
zealots 
may 
uphold 
the cause of environmentalism 
or animal 
rights, 
appar 
ently unmoved 
by the outrages 
committed 
against 
their own 
species 
by various 
dictators?at 
least they devote 
none 
of their energies 
to 
action 
on 
these 
fronts. 
Similarly, 
there are ardent 
nuclear 
disarmers 
who 
do not care to reform 
the sexism 
out of their own 
language 
and 
practices, or who 
routinely discard unopened all mail beseeching 
them 
to enlist 
in the cause 
of Amnesty 
International 
or Oxfam. 
There can be little doubt how these exotic specimens of do-gooder 
come 
into existence. We 
are all of the noblesse 
these days. We

the daunting 
luxury 
of the time, 
energy, 
knowledge, 
and power 
to 
undertake 
a broader 
purpose 
than merely 
staying 
alive and keeping 
our 
immediate 
kin 
in the same 
condition. 
Technology 
has 
created 
innumerable 
opportunities 
for us to know, 
and 
to act. We 
want 
to 
deal responsibly with this bounty, but we do not know how. When 
we turn to the question of which priority should engage our best 
efforts, we 
drown 
in the available 
information, 
unable 
to make 
truly 
principled 
decisions. 
Our 
responses 
exhibit 
a sort 
of Rorschach 
magnification 
of whatever 
minor 
personal 
proclivities 
emerge 
from 
the noise 
of competing 
and imponderable 
alternatives. 
The 
results, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, may 
often 
be eccentric, 
but 
they are arguably 
better 
than the course 
chosen 
by those who 
sit on their hands 
and ignore all 
appeals, 
on the grounds 
that they cannot 
calculate?have 
no time to 
calculate?which 
appeal 
is the worthiest. 
One would think that any solution there might be to this practical 
dilemma would 
stem from philosophy, and more narrowly from 
ethics, but much as I would 
like to relate that the humanists either 
have 
the answer 
or at least have 
undertaken 
the research 
program 
that ought 
to yield 
the answer, 
I must 
report 
that almost 
no direct 
attention has yet been paid to this troubling moral problem by 
professional 
philosophers. 
The reason for this is not hard to find. Ethics, like any theoretical 
enterprise 
in science, 
has 
always 
been 
conducted 
with 
the aid of 
idealizations. 
Reality, 
in all 
its messy 
particularity, 
is simply 
too 
complicated 
to theorize 
about 
taken 
straight. 
A 
favorite 
idealization 
in ethics has been the useful myth of the moral agent with unlimited 
knowledge 
and 
time 
for ethical 
decision-making. 
For 
instance, 
con 
sequentialist 
theories, 
such 
as the various 
brands 
of utilitarianism, 
declare 
that what 
ought 
to be done 
is always 
whatever 
course 
of 
action will 
have 
the best expected 
consequences 
all things considered. 
Although 
consequentialists 
know 
perfectly 
well 
that no one can ever 
truly consider 
all things?even 
all relevant 
things?they 
still choose 
to 
couch their theories in terms of what 
the ideally reflective and 
conscientious 
decision-maker 
would 
have made 
of all the available 
facts. This 
presumably 
gives one 
a standard 
of conduct 
at which 
to 
aim, 
if never 
in fact 
to reach. 
In practice, 
we 
tend 
to overlook 
important 
considerations 
and bias our thinking 
in numerous 
idiosyn 
cratic ways, but in principle what we should do is what this ideal

149 
calculator 
of 
consequences 
decides 
will 
most 
probably 
maximize 
utility 
(or whatever 
we 
call the good 
consequences). 
The plain fact that we are all finite, forgetful, and have to rush to 
judgment 
is standardly 
recognized, 
not 
implausibly, 
as a real but 
irrelevant 
element 
of friction 
in the machinery 
whose 
blueprint 
we 
are 
describing. It is as if there might be two disciplines?ethics 
proper, 
which undertakes the task of calculating the principles of what one 
ought 
to do under 
all circumstances?and 
then 
the less interesting, 
"merely practical" discipline of Moral First Aid, or What to Do Until 
the Doctor of Philosophy Arrives, which tells, in rough and ready 
terms, how 
to make 
decisions 
under 
time pressure. 
My suspicion is that traditional theories of ethics all either depend 
on or founder on the very elements of friction that are ignored by the 
standard 
idealization. 
Information 
technology, 
by 
removing 
the 
friction, 
helps 
expose 
the weakness 
of much 
that has 
passed 
for 
sound 
in ethics. 
For 
instance, 
a bench 
test that most 
ethical 
theories 
pass with ease is the problem: what should you do if you are walking 
along, minding 
your own business, 
and you hear a cry for help 
from 
a drowning 
man? 
But 
almost 
no one 
faces predicaments 
with 
that 
logical form anymore; instead we hear, every day, while desperately 
trying 
to mind 
our own 
business, 
a thousand 
cries for help, 
complete 
with volumes of information on how we might oblige.9 On this 
ubiquitous 
problem, 
traditional 
ethical 
systems 
are essentially 
re 
duced 
to silence 
or transparent 
handwaving. 
This 
is too 
large a claim 
to support 
here, 
but I can at least sketch 
the problem 
as I currently 
envision 
it. How 
could we write 
the Moral 
First Aid Manual? 
Or, might 
we 
replace 
the manual 
with 
something 
fancier?an Expert System for Moral Advice-Giving in Real Time? 
The 
fantasy 
of 
just such 
an 
expert 
system 
often 
lurks 
in the 
shadows of ethical theory. "If what I ought to do is whatever has the 
highest expected utility, how on earth shall I calculate it in the time 
available?" This question has been familiar for over a hundred years, 
and the standard response from the moral philosophers 
is well 
expressed by John Stuart Mill, who borrowed a metaphor from the 
technology of his own day: 
Nobody 
argues 
that the art of navigation 
is not founded 
on astronomy 
because 
sailors 
cannot wait 
to calculate 
the Nautical 
Almanac.

rational 
creatures,

creatures 
go out upon 
the sea of life with 
their minds 
made 
up on the 
common 
questions 
of right and wrong 
. .. .10 
This 
is as fine an idea today as it was 
in Mill's 
time, but the metaphor 
misleadingly 
invites us to ignore 
the fact that the future position 
of 
the heavenly bodies could actually be calculated in advance, using the 
technology of the day. Where is the Moral Almanac that would guide 
the moral 
chooser 
through 
the 
stormy 
seas 
of 
life? We 
are 
still 
debugging 
it.11 Jeremy 
Bentham, 
Mill's 
contemporary, 
set out 
to 
create 
a "hedonic 
calculus," 
and while 
no 
one 
takes 
it seriously 
today, 
the descendants 
of 
this quaint 
museum 
piece 
are still being 
produced, 
elaborated, 
and, above 
all, advertised, 
not 
just by philos 
ophers, 
but by "cost-benefit 
analysts," 
computer 
modelers, 
and other 
futurologists. 
What 
should be evident to computer scientists, if still easily 
overlooked by philosophers, is that the idea of actually producing a 
reliable 
or authoritative 
consequentialist 
almanac 
of any generality 
is 
sheer 
fantasy, 
now 
and at any future 
time. Compare 
the demanding 
specifications 
for such a system with 
the now well-known 
limitations 
on 
far simpler 
forecasting 
and problem-solving 
tools. 
S/?or?-range 
real-time 
weather 
forecasting, 
for instance, 
has 
reached 
useful 
levels 
of reliability 
by restricting 
itself severely 
to a handful 
of measures, 
coarse-grained 
data-grids, 
and relatively 
simple 
equations, 
and 
then 
exhausting 
the powers 
of the world's 
fastest 
super-computers. 
De 
tailed 
forecasting 
of the weather 
months 
into the future 
is probably 
computationally 
intractable 
under 
any circumstances.12 
If it proves 
not to be intractable, 
it will 
be only because micro-climatic 
effects will 
be 
shown 
not 
to propagate 
chaotically 
after 
all. Yet, 
we 
already 
know, 
from 
countless 
everyday 
experiences, 
that 
"micro-social" 
effects?some 
unknown 
individual's 
dislike 
of Tylenol, 
for exam 
ple?can 
create major 
perturbations 
in the best-laid 
human 
plans 
and 
social 
trends. 
Even supposing the prediction problem could somehow be tamed, 
the evaluation 
problem 
would 
remain. 
In chess-playing 
programs, 
the 
problem 
of when 
to terminate 
look-ahead 
and evaluate 
the resulting 
position has led to the framing of the principle of quiescence: Always 
look 
several moves 
beyond 
any flurry 
of exchanges 
and postpone 
final 
evaluation 
until 
a relatively 
quiescent 
board 
position 
obtains. 
This satisfactory, though not foolproof, strategy of chess design, is

and the Virtues of Ignorance 
151 
systematically 
inapplicable 
to the design 
of our moral 
advice-giver, 
because of what we might call the Three Mile 
Island Effect. It has 
now 
been 
several 
relatively 
quiescent 
years 
since 
the melt-down 
at 
Three Mile 
Island, 
but can we 
yet say, with 
confidence 
better 
than a 
coin flip, whether that was one of the good things that have happened 
or one of the bad? 
If our 
imagined 
system were 
to generate 
a future 
path of probability p with Three Mile Island as its terminus, should 
it assign a high or low utility to the event? The trouble is, of course, 
that in life there is no checkmate, no fixed point finitely in the future 
at which 
we 
get one definitive 
result or another, 
from which 
we might 
calculate, 
by retrograde 
analysis, 
the actual 
values 
of the alternatives 
that lie along the paths followed and not followed. So there is no way, 
and could 
be no way, 
to tune the parameters 
of any prototype 
expert 
system we 
designed?except 
by the invocation, 
as usual, 
of ideology 
and handwaving. 
The 
suspicion 
that 
consequentialist 
theories 
are 
systematically 
infeasible is nothing new. It has fueled support for the so-called 
Kantian 
or duty-based 
ethical 
alternative 
for over a century.13 
As 
the 
Pirate King says to Frederick, the self-styled "slave of duty" in The 
Pirates 
of Penzance, 
"Always 
follow 
the dictates 
of your 
conscience, 
me 
boy?and 
chance 
the consequences!" 
The 
trouble 
is that 
such 
duty-based 
theories, while 
not always 
leading 
to results 
as comical 
or 
pathetic as Frederick's myopic posings and blunderings in The Pirates 
of Penzance, 
have 
hardly 
coalesced 
into a stable 
and 
compelling 
system 
of 
recipes 
for action. 
Kant's 
own 
categorical 
imperative, 
which 
he quite 
consciously 
conceived 
as the one 
and only 
rule that 
needed to be printed in the Moral First Aid Manual, appears today 
about 
as naive 
and impractical 
a guide as Bentham's 
hedonic 
calculus. 
It is a step 
in the right direction 
however, 
and what 
is new 
is the 
opportunity 
to reconceive 
of these 
alternatives 
to consequentialism 
through the lens of artificial intelligence as responses to the inescap 
able demands 
of real-time 
heuristic 
decision-making. 
When 
viewed 
from 
this perspective, 
for instance, 
what 
would 
count 
as a justifica 
tion or defense of an ethical principle shifts significantly. This opens 
up a promising 
research 
program 
in philosophy, 
in my 
opinion, 
and 
I think it will gain more than just jargon from its engineering perspective. 
The 
first, general 
result 
is appealing: 
we 
can already 
see that, since 
any 
"system" 
for ethical 
decision-making 
must 
be bounded

nMiH's 
idea was that the everyday maxims of morality 
that people had "made 
up their minds" about could be shown to be reliable rules of thumb that fol 
lowed, 
somehow, 
from 
the more 
laborious 
and 
authoritative 
calculations 
of 
utilitarianism.

13The Kantian philosopher, Onora O'Neill, 
in "The Perplexities of Famine Relief," 
in Matters of Life and Death, ed. Tom Regan (New York: Random House, 
1980) 
offers a convincing analysis of the fundamental embarrassment of utilitarianism: 
two competent and well-informed utilitarians, Garrett Hardin and Peter Singer, 
addressing the same issue (what if anything to do about famine relief), holding the 
same 
ethical 
theory, 
and having 
access 
to the same 
empirical 
information, 
arrive 
at opposing counsels: one thinks the case is compelling for dramatic forms of aid; 
to the other it is equally "obvious" that all such aid should be withheld. See also 
O'Neill's Faces of Hunger 
(Boston, MA: Allen and Unwin, 
1986).
