Developing and Testing 
Your Investing Beliefs
What are your investing beliefs? Most investors haven’t taken the time to consider 
that question, let alone answer it. During the sharp stock market slide in 2008, 
some investors started following particular gurus who claimed to have predicted 
the financial crisis. These investors wanted to believe that someone out there 
could predict important financial events and tell folks how to time their invest-
ments to benefit from what was about to unfold.
Such market timing is a fool’s errand. It sounds possible, and we’d like to believe 
that it is possible, but it’s not possible on the scale various charlatans would have 
you believe. Furthermore, many of those who boast the loudest about their 
­market-timing ability are worse than average at it.
It’s challenging to work with someone on his investments when he has little in the 
way of background and beliefs. As someone seeking to educate yourself about invest-
ing, you may have a better idea of your investment beliefs than other investors do. 
To help you along in this process, here are some beliefs for you to consider:
»
» Your own personal comfort matters. A wide range of investments are 
available to you, including stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, 
real estate, and small business. Some folks are simply more comfortable with 
particular investments, so you shouldn’t force yourself into a portfolio that’s 
recommended as being best for you. Consider the value of your time and 
your investing skills and desires. Investing in stocks and other securities via 
the best mutual funds and ETFs is both time-efficient and profitable. Real 
estate investing and running a small business are the most time-intensive 
investments.
»
» Costs matter. The more you pay in commissions and management fees on 
your investments, the greater the drag on your returns. And don’t fall prey to 
thinking that you get what you pay for. Take advantage of tax-deductible 
retirement accounts, and understand the effect of your tax bracket when 
investing outside tax-sheltered retirement accounts. Minimize your trading. 
The more you trade, the more likely you are to make mistakes. Also, you 
suffer increased transaction costs and higher taxes for non-retirement- 
account investments.

»
» Market timing is much harder to predict than folks realize. Don’t bail 
when things look bleak. The hardest time, psychologically, to hold on to your 
investments is when they’re down. Even the best investments go through 
depressed periods, which is the worst possible time to sell. Don’t sell when 
there’s a sale going on; if anything, consider buying more. Ignore soothsayers 
and prognosticators. Predicting the future is nearly impossible.
»
» There are better times than others to sell. When you’re really feeling good 
about an asset class like stocks, and those assets have had a multiple-year run 
and are getting widespread accolades, that’s a good time to lighten up if you 
have other good reasons for doing so. By contrast, you can bump up your 
stock allocation if you’re comfortable doing so after a major market decline.
»
» Think long-term. Because ownership investments like stocks, real estate, and 
small business are more volatile, you must keep your long-term perspective 
when investing in them. Don’t invest money in such investments unless you 
plan to hold them for a minimum of five years and preferably for a decade or 
longer.
»
» Diversify. Diversification is a powerful investment concept that helps you 
reduce the risk of holding more-aggressive investments. Diversifying simply 
means that you hold a variety of investments that don’t move in tandem in 
different market environments. When investing in stocks, for example, invest 
worldwide. You can diversify further by investing in real estate.
»
» Emphasize value. Over the long term, value-oriented investments tend to 
produce higher returns with less volatility than do pure growth-oriented 
investments.
»
» Ignore the minutiae. Don’t feel mystified by or feel the need to follow the 
short-term gyrations of the financial markets. Ultimately, the prices of stocks, 
bonds, and other financial instruments are determined by supply and 
demand, which are influenced by thousands of external issues, including 
millions of investors’ expectations and fears.
»
» You are what you read and listen to. Don’t pollute your mind with bad 
investing strategies and philosophies. The quality of what you read and listen 
to is far more important than the quantity.

Introduction      1
Introduction
I
nvesting offers so many possibilities and so many choices. Your young adult 
years, which at least for the purposes of this book I define as your 20s and 30s, 
are filled with so much promise and potential. Your career, your interests, your 
personal life, and your family and friends all compete for your time and 
attention.
Most folks work upward of 2,000 hours per year earning a living. Managing the 
money that passes through their hands is an important task, one most people 
aren’t trained to do.
Earning money generally takes a lot of work. Managing your personal finances 
and saving money take discipline and sacrifice. When you have money to invest, 
you want to do the best you can so you earn a decent return without ending up in 
failed investments.
About This Book
I designed and wrote this book to help you with the important and challenging 
task of investing. Your young adult years are a great time to lay the best founda-
tion for investing wisely. After all, some of the investments you make now and in 
the near future will have decades to grow and multiply.
I’ve worked with and taught people from all financial situations, so I know the 
investing concerns and questions of real folks just like you. I’ve discovered how 
important having healthy and strong personal finances and investments is.
I first became interested in money matters as a middle-school student when my 
father was laid off from his employer and received some retirement money.  
I worked with my dad to make investing decisions with the money. A couple of 
years later, I won my high school’s science fair with a project on what influences 
the stock market.

2      Investing in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
During my younger adult years, I worked hard to keep my living expenses low and 
to save and invest money so I could leave my job and pursue my entrepreneurial 
ideas. I accomplished that goal in my late 20s. I hope to give you some tools to 
help you make the most of your money and investments so you too can meet your 
goals and dreams.
This book is basic enough to help a novice get his or her arms around thorny 
investing issues. But advanced readers will be challenged as well to think about 
their investments and finances in a new way and identify areas for improvement. 
Check out the table of contents for a chapter-by-chapter rundown of what this 
book offers. You can also look up a specific topic in the index. Or you can turn a 
few pages and start at the beginning: Chapter 1.
Foolish Assumptions
No matter what your current situation is — whether you’re entering the job mar-
ket right after high school, graduating college with a large amount of student loan 
debt, feeling pretty well established in your career, and so on — I thought of you 
as I wrote this book and made some assumptions about you:
»
» You want expert advice about important investing topics such as getting a 
preinvesting financial checkup, understanding the range of investments 
available, and assembling a killer investment portfolio. And you want that 
advice quickly.
»
» You want a crash course in investing and are looking for a book you can read 
cover to cover to help solidify major concepts and get you thinking about your 
investments in a more comprehensive way.
»
» You’re tired of feeling overwhelmed by your investing choices and stressed 
out by the ever-changing economic and investing landscape, and you want to 
get more comfortable with your investment selections.

Investing Options
S
o many subject areas and disciplines are packed full of jargon. Some of this 
is the result of “progress” and advances, and some of it is caused by workers 
in the field not going out of their way to explain and define things.
In this chapter, I give you the lay of the land regarding the enormous numbers of 
investment choices and foreign-sounding terminology that await you in the world 
of investing. I also explain the types of companies that offer investments and their 
strengths and weaknesses. And should you want to hire some investing help,  
I also detail the various professionals pitching their services to you and the 
­common credentials they hawk to convince you of their expertise.
Growing Your Money in Ownership 
Investments
The most exciting thing about investing during your younger adult years is that 
you can be more aggressive with money that you’ve earmarked to help you accom-
plish long-term goals. To achieve typical longer-term financial goals, such as 

8      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
being financially independent (also known as retiring), the money that you save 
and invest generally needs to grow at a rate much faster than the rate of inflation. 
If you put your money in a bank account that pays little or no interest, for exam-
ple, you’re likely to fall short of your goals.
Ownership investments are investments like stocks, where you own a piece of a 
company, real estate, or a small business that has the capability to generate rev-
enue and profits. Over the long term, consider ownership investments if you want 
your money to grow much faster than the rate of inflation and don’t mind more 
volatility in your investments’ values.
The downside to such investments is that they can fall more significantly in value 
than non-ownership investments (for example, bank accounts, bonds, and so on), 
especially in the short term. So don’t put money into ownership investments that 
you may need to tap in the short term for rent money or your next vacation. To 
reduce the risk of ownership investments, diversify — that is, hold different types 
of ownership investments that don’t move in tandem.
I highlight three major ownership investments in the following sections: stocks, 
real estate, and small business.
Sharing in corporate growth  
and profits: Stocks
If you want the potential to share in the growth and profits of companies, you can 
gain it through buying shares of their stock. Stocks are shares of ownership in a 
company. You can buy stock directly in individual companies through a brokerage 
account, or you can buy a collection of stocks via a mutual fund or exchange-
traded fund (see Chapter 10).
You don’t need to be a business genius to make money in stocks. Simply make 
regular and systematic investments, and invest in proven companies and funds 
while minimizing your investment expenses and taxes. Of course, there’s no 
guarantee that every stock or stock fund that you buy will increase in value. In 
Chapter 8, I explain proven and time-tested methods for making money in stocks.
Profiting from real estate
You don’t need to be a high roller to make money investing in real estate. Owning 
and managing real estate is like running a small business: You need to satisfy 
customers (tenants), manage your costs, keep an eye on the competition, and so 
on. Some methods of real estate investing require more time than others, but 
many are proven ways to build wealth.

CHAPTER 1  Making Sense of Your Investing Options      9
Among the key attributes of real estate investment are the following:
»
» You build wealth through your rental income exceeding your expenses and 
through property-value appreciation.
»
» You can leverage your investment by borrowing money.
»
» You must be comfortable dealing with property management, which includes 
finding and retaining tenants and keeping up (and possibly improving) your 
property.
See Chapter 12 for the details on investing in real estate.
Succeeding in small business
I know people who have hit investing home runs by owning or buying businesses. 
Most people work full-time at running their businesses, increasing their chances 
of doing something big financially with them. Investing in the stock market, by 
contrast, tends to be more part-time in nature.
In addition to the financial rewards, however, small-business owners can enjoy 
seeing the impact of their work and knowing that it makes a difference. I can 
speak from firsthand experience (as can other small-business owners) in saying 
that emotionally and financially, entrepreneurship is a roller coaster.
Besides starting your own company, you can share in the economic rewards of the 
entrepreneurial world through buying an existing business or investing in some-
one else’s budding enterprise. See Chapter 14 for more details.
Keeping Money in Lending Investments
In the first section of this chapter, “Growing Your Money in Ownership Invest-
ments,” I outline how you can make your dough grow much faster than the cost 
of living by using stocks, real estate, and small business. However, you may want 
or need to play it safer when investing money for shorter-term purposes, so you 
should then consider lending investments. Many people use such investments 
through local banks, such as in a checking account, savings account, or certificate 
of deposit. In all these cases with a bank, you’re lending your money to the bank.
Another lending investment is bonds. When you purchase a bond that has been 
issued by the government or a company, you agree to lend your money for a 

10      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
predetermined period of time and receive a particular rate of interest. A corporate 
bond may pay you 4 percent interest annually over the next three years, for 
example.
An investor’s return from lending investments is typically limited to the original 
investment plus interest payments. If you lend your money to a company through 
one of its bonds that matures in, say, five years, and the firm doubles its revenue 
and profits over that period, you won’t share in its growth. The company’s stock-
holders are likely to reap the rewards of the company’s success, but as a bond-
holder, you don’t. You simply get interest and the face value of the bond back at 
maturity.
Similar to bank savings accounts, money market mutual funds are another type of 
lending investment. Money market mutual funds generally invest in ultra-safe 
things such as short-term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. government–issued 
Treasury bills, and commercial paper (short-term bonds) that the most credit-
worthy corporations issue.
Many people keep too much of their money in lending investments, thus allowing 
others to enjoy the rewards of economic growth. Although lending investments 
appear safer because you know in advance what return you’ll receive, they aren’t 
that safe. The long-term risk of these seemingly safe money investments is that 
your money will grow too slowly (perhaps not even keeping you ahead of or even 
with the rate of inflation) to enable you to accomplish your personal financial 
goals. In the worst cases, the company or other institution to which you’re lending 
money can go under and fail to repay your loan.
Understanding Risks and Returns
Who among us wants to lose money? Of course you don’t! You put your money 
into an investment in the hope and expectation that you will get back more in total 
than you put in. And you’d rather your chosen investments not fluctuate too 
widely in value. When it comes to investing, no concepts are more important to 
grasp than risk and return, which I explain in this section.
Understanding risks
The investments that you expect to produce higher returns fluctuate more in 
value, particularly in the short term. However, if you attempt to avoid all the risks 
involved in investing, you probably won’t succeed, and you likely won’t be happy 
with your investment results and lifestyle. In the investment world, some people 

CHAPTER 1  Making Sense of Your Investing Options      11
don’t go near stocks or real estate that they perceive to be volatile, for example. As 
a result, such investors often end up with lousy long-term returns and expose 
themselves to some high risks that they overlooked, such as the risk of inflation 
and taxes eroding the purchasing power of their money.
You can’t live without taking risks. Risk-free activities or ways of living don’t 
exist. You can sensibly minimize risks, but you can never eliminate them. Some 
methods of risk reduction aren’t palatable because they reduce your quality of life.
Risks are also composed of several factors. Following are the major types of 
investment risks and a few of the methods you can use to reduce these risks while 
not missing out on the upside that investments offer:
»
» Market-value risk: Although stocks can help you build wealth, they can also 
drop 20 percent or more in a relatively short period of time. Although real 
estate, like stocks, has been a rewarding long-term investment, various real 
estate markets get clobbered from time to time.
»
» Individual-investment risk: A down market can put an entire investment 
market on a roller-coaster ride, but healthy markets also have their share of 
individual losers. Just as individual stock prices can plummet, so can individual 
real estate property prices.
With lending investments, you have a claim on a specific amount of a cur-
rency. Occasionally, currencies falter. Most folks ignore this low frequency but 
very high impact risk when thinking about lending investments.
»
» Purchasing-power risk: Inflation — which is an increase in the cost of 
living — can erode the value of your money and its purchasing power (what 
you can buy with that money). I often see skittish investors keep their money 
in bonds and money market accounts, thinking that they’re playing it safe. The 
risk in this strategy is that your money won’t grow enough over the years for 
you to accomplish your financial goals. In other words, the lower the return 
you earn, the more you need to save to reach a financial goal. As a younger 
investor with so many years and decades of investing in your future, you need 
to pay the most attention to the risk of generating low returns.
»
» Liquidity risk: Some investments are more liquid (how quickly an investment 
can be converted to cash) than others and more readily sold at fair market 
value on short notice. Bank savings accounts have no real liquidity risk. A real 
estate investment, by contrast, takes time and money to sell, and if you must 
sell most real estate quickly, you’ll likely get a fair amount less than its current 
full market value.

12      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
»
» Career risk: In your 20s and 30s, your ability to earn money is probably your 
biggest asset. Education is a lifelong process. If you don’t continually invest in 
your education, you risk losing your competitive edge. Your skills and perspec-
tives can become dated and obsolete. Although that doesn’t mean you should 
work 80 hours a week and never do anything fun, it does mean that part of 
your “work” time should involve upgrading your skills.
Managing risks
Throughout this book as I discuss various investments, I explain how to get the 
most out of each one. Because I’ve introduced the important issue of risk in this 
chapter, I would be remiss if I also didn’t give you some early ideas about how to 
minimize those risks. Here are some simple steps you can take to lower the risk of 
investments that can upset the achievement of your goals:
»
» Do your homework. When you purchase real estate, a whole host of 
inspections can save you from buying a money pit. With stocks, you can 
examine some measures of value and the company’s financial condition and 
business strategy to reduce your chances of buying into an overpriced 
company or one on the verge of major problems.
»
» Diversify. Placing significant amounts of your capital in one or a handful of 
securities is risky, particularly if the stocks are in the same industry or closely 
related industries. To reduce this risk, purchase stocks in a variety of indus-
tries and companies within each industry. Even better is buying diversified 
mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Diversifying your investments can 
involve more than just your stock portfolio. You can also hold some real estate 
investments to diversify your investment portfolio.
If you worry about the health of the U.S. economy, the government, and the 
dollar, you can reduce your investment risk by investing overseas. Most large 
U.S. companies do business overseas, so when you invest in larger U.S. 
company stocks, you get some international investment exposure. You can 
also invest in international company stocks, ideally through funds.
»
» Minimize holdings in costly markets. Although I don’t believe that most 
investors can time the markets — buy low, sell high — spotting a greatly 
overpriced market isn’t too difficult. You should avoid overpriced investments 
because when they fall, they usually fall farther and faster than more fairly 
priced investments. Also, you should be able to find other investments that 
offer higher potential returns. Throughout this book, I explain some simple 
yet powerful methods you can use to measure whether a particular invest-
ment market is of fair value, of good value, or overpriced.

CHAPTER 1  Making Sense of Your Investing Options      13
»
» View market declines in a different light. Instead of seeing declines and 
market corrections as horrible things, view them as potential opportunities or 
“sales.” If you pass up the stock and real estate markets simply because of the 
potential market-value risk, you miss out on a historic, time-tested method of 
building substantial wealth. Try not to give in to the human emotions that 
often scare people away from buying something that others seem to be 
shunning.
Making sense of returns
Each investment has its own mix of associated risks that you take when you part 
with your investment dollar and, likewise, offers a different potential rate of 
return. When you make investments, you have the potential to make money in a 
variety of ways.
To determine how much money you’ve made or lost on your investment, you cal-
culate the total return. To come up with this figure, you determine how much 
money you originally invested and then factor in the other components, such as 
interest, dividends, and appreciation or depreciation.
If you’ve ever had money in a bank account that pays interest, you know that the 
bank pays you a small amount of interest in exchange for your allowing the bank 
to keep your money. The bank then turns around and lends your money to some 
other person or organization at a much higher rate of interest. The rate of interest 
is also known as the yield. So if a bank tells you that its savings account pays 
1.5 percent interest, the bank may also say that the account yields 1.5 percent. 
Banks usually quote interest rates or yields on an annual basis. Interest that you 
receive is one component of the return you receive on your investment.
If a bank pays monthly interest, the bank also likely quotes a compounded effec-
tive annual yield. After the first month’s interest is credited to your account, that 
interest starts earning interest as well. So the bank may say that the account pays 
1.5 percent, which compounds to an effective annual yield of 1.53 percent.
When you lend your money directly to a company — which is what you do when 
you invest in a bond that a corporation issues — you also receive interest. Bonds, 
as well as stocks (which are shares of ownership in a company), fluctuate in mar-
ket value after they’re issued.
When you invest in a company’s stock, you hope that the stock increases (appreci-
ates) in value. Of course, a stock can also decline, or depreciate, in value. This 
change in market value is part of your return from a stock or bond investment.

14      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
Stocks can also pay dividends, which are the company’s way of sharing some of its 
profits with you as a stockholder and thus are part of your return. Some compa-
nies, particularly those that are small or growing rapidly, choose to reinvest all 
their profits back into the company.
Unless you held your investments in a tax-sheltered retirement account, you owe 
taxes on your return. Specifically, the dividends and investment appreciation that 
you realize upon selling are taxed, although often at relatively low rates. The tax 
rates on so-called long-term capital gains and stock dividends are currently and 
historically lower than the tax rates on other income. I discuss the different tax 
rates that affect your investments and explain how to make tax-wise investment 
decisions that fit with your overall personal financial situation and goals in 
Chapter 4.
Where to Invest and Get Advice
Discussing the companies through which you can invest and where to get invest-
ing advice may seem out of place to you if you started reading this book from the 
beginning. But I’m doing this because I strongly believe that you should begin to 
think about and understand the lay of the land in these important areas so you can 
make the best choices.
Selecting the firm or firms through which to do your investing is a hugely impor-
tant decision. So is the decision about from whom to get or pay for investing 
advice. In this section, I address both of these topics.
Finding the best fund companies  
and brokers
Insurance companies, banks, investment brokerage firms, mutual funds — the 
list of companies that stand ready to help you invest your money is nearly endless. 
Most people stumble into a relationship with an investment firm. They may 
choose a company because their employer uses it for company retirement plans or 
they’ve read about or been referred to a particular company.
When you invest in certain securities — such as stocks and bonds and exchange-
traded funds (ETFs) — and when you want to hold mutual funds from different 
companies in a single account, you need brokerage services. Brokers execute your 
trades to buy or sell stocks, bonds, and other securities and enable you to central-
ize your holdings of mutual funds, ETFs, and other investments. Your broker can 
also assist you with other services that may interest you.

CHAPTER 1  Making Sense of Your Investing Options      15
Deciding which investment company is best for you depends on your needs and 
wants. In addition to fees, consider how important having a local branch office is 
to you. If you want to invest in mutual funds, you’ll want to choose a firm that 
offers access to good funds, including money market funds in which you can 
deposit money awaiting investment or proceeds from a sale.
For the lowest trading commissions, you generally must place your trades online. 
But you should be careful. A low brokerage fee of, say, $7 or $10 per trade doesn’t 
really save you money if you trade a lot and rack up significant total commissions. 
Also you pay more in taxes when you trade more frequently and realize shorter-
term (one year or less) profits.
Trading online is an easy way to act impulsively and emotionally when making 
important investment decisions. If you’re prone to such actions, or if you find 
yourself tracking and trading investments too closely, stay away from this form of 
trading, and use the Internet only to check account information and gather factual 
information. Increasing numbers of brokers offer account information and trad-
ing capabilities via apps, which, of course, can also promote addictive investment 
behaviors.
Please see Chapter 9 for more details on selecting the best investment brokerage 
firms and my top investment firm selections that offer mutual funds and ETFs 
and/or brokerage services.
Finding an acceptable advisor
I would always counsel folks who took personal finance courses I taught or who 
contacted me seeking advice to get educated before engaging the services of any 
financial advisor. How can you possibly evaluate the competence of someone you 
may hire if you yourself are financially clueless? You’ve got this book, so read it 
before you consider hiring someone for financial advice.
By taking the themes and major concepts of this book to heart, you greatly mini-
mize your chances of making significant investment blunders, including hiring an 
incompetent or unethical advisor. You might be tempted, for example, to retain 
the services of an advisor who claims that he and his firm can predict the future 
economic environment and position your portfolio to take advantage. But you find 
in reading this book that financial advisors don’t have crystal balls and that you 
should steer clear of folks who purport to be able jump into and out of investments 
based upon their forecasts.

16      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
Finding a competent and objective financial advisor isn’t easy. Historically, most 
financial consultants work on commission, and the promise of that commission 
can cloud their judgment. Among the minority of fee-based advisors, almost all 
manage money, which creates other conflicts of interest. The more money you 
give them to invest and manage, the more money these advisors make. That’s why 
I generally prefer seeking financial (and tax) advice from advisors who sell their 
time (on an hourly basis) and don’t sell anything else.
Because investment decisions are a critical part of financial planning, take note of 
the fact that the most common designations of educational training among pro-
fessional money managers are MBA (master of business administration) and CFA 
(chartered financial analyst). Financial planners often have the CFP (certified 
financial planner) credential, and some tax advisors who work on an hourly basis 
have the PFS (personal financial specialist) credential.
Advisors who provide investment advice and oversee at least $100 million must 
register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); otherwise, they 
generally register with the state that they make their principal place of business. 
They must file Form ADV, otherwise known as the Uniform Application for Invest-
ment Adviser Registration. This lengthy document asks investment advisors to 
provide in a uniform format such details as a breakdown of where their income 
comes from, their education and employment history, the types of securities the 
advisory firm recommends, and the advisor’s fee schedule.
You can ask the advisor to send you a copy of his Form ADV. You can also find out 
whether the advisor is registered and whether he has a track record of problems by 
calling the SEC at 800-732-0330 or by visiting its website at www.adviserinfo.
sec.gov. Many states require the registration of financial advisors, so you should 
also contact the department that oversees advisors in your state. Visit the North 
American Securities Administrators Association’s website (www.nasaa.org), and 
click the Contact Your Regulator link on the home page.

Using Investments to 
Accomplish Your Goals
S
aving and investing money can make you feel good and in control. Ultimately, 
most folks are investing money to accomplish particular goals. Saving and 
investing for a car purchase, expenses for higher education, a home purchase, 
new furniture, or a vacation are typical short-term goals. You can also invest 
toward longer-term goals, such as your financial independence or retirement 
decades in the future.
In this chapter, I discuss how you can use investments to accomplish common 
shorter- and longer-term goals.
Setting and Prioritizing Your  
Shorter-Term Goals
Unless you earn really big bucks or expect to have a large family inheritance to 
tap, your personal and financial desires will probably outstrip your resources. 
Thus, you must prioritize your goals.

18      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
One of the biggest mistakes I see people make is rushing into a financial decision 
without considering what’s really important to them. Because many people get 
caught up in the responsibilities of their daily lives, they often don’t have time for 
reflection. Take that time, because people who identify their goals and then work 
toward them, which often requires changing some habits, accomplish their goals.
In this section, I discuss common “shorter-term” financial goals  — such as 
establishing an emergency reserve, making major purchases, owning a home, and 
starting a small business — and how to work toward them. Accomplishing such 
goals almost always requires saving money.
Accumulating a rainy-day fund
The future is unpredictable. Take the uncertainty simply surrounding your job: 
You could lose your job, or you might want to leave it. Because you don’t know 
what the future holds, preparing for the unexpected is financially wise. Enter the 
emergency or rainy-day fund.
The size of your emergency fund depends on your personal situation. Begin by 
considering how much you spend in a typical month. Here are some benchmarks 
for how many months’ worth of living expenses you should have:
»
» Three months’ living expenses: When you’re starting out, this minimalist 
approach makes sense if your only current source of emergency funds is a 
high-interest credit card. Longer-term, you could make do with three months’ 
living expenses if you have other accounts, such as a 401(k), or family 
members and close friends whom you can tap for a short-term loan.
»
» Six months’ living expenses: If you don’t have other places to turn for a loan, 
or if you have some instability in your employment situation or source of 
income, you need more of a cushion.
»
» Twelve months’ living expenses: Consider this large a stash if your income 
fluctuates greatly or if your occupation involves a high risk of job loss, finding 
another job could take you a long time, or you don’t have other places to turn 
for a loan.
Saving for large purchases
Most people want things — such as furniture, a vacation, or a car — that they 
don’t have cash on hand to pay for. I strongly advise saving for your larger con-
sumer purchases to avoid paying for them over time with high-interest consumer 

CHAPTER 2  Using Investments to Accomplish Your Goals      19
credit. Don’t take out credit card or auto loans — otherwise known as consumer 
credit — to make large purchases. (Don’t be duped by a seemingly low interest rate 
on, for example, a car loan. You could get the car at a lower price if you don’t opt 
for such a loan.)
Paying for high-interest consumer debt can undermine your ability to save toward 
your goals and your ability to make major purchases in the future. Don’t deny 
yourself gratification; just figure out how to delay it. When contemplating the 
purchase of a consumer item on credit, add up the total interest you’d end up pay-
ing on your debt, and call it the price of instant gratification.
Investing for a small business or home
In your early years of saving and investing, deciding whether to save money to buy 
a home or to put money into a retirement account presents a dilemma. In the long 
run, owning your own home is usually a wise financial move. On the other hand, 
saving sooner for retirement makes achieving your goals easier and reduces your 
income tax bill.
Presuming that both goals are important to you, you can save toward both goals: 
buying a home and retiring. If you’re eager to own a home, you can throw all your 
savings toward achieving that goal and temporarily put your retirement savings 
on hold.
You can make penalty-free withdrawals of up to $10,000 from Individual Retire-
ment Accounts (IRAs) toward a first-time home purchase. You might also be able 
to have the best of both worlds if you work for an employer that allows borrowing 
against retirement account balances. You can save money in the retirement 
account and then borrow against it for the down payment on a home. Consider 
this option with great care, though, because retirement account loans generally 
must be repaid within a few years or when you quit or lose your job (ask your 
employer for the details).
When saving money for starting or buying a business, most people encounter the 
same dilemma they face when deciding to save to buy a house: If you fund your 
retirement accounts to the exclusion of earmarking money for your small-business 
dreams, your entrepreneurial aspirations may never become reality. Generally, I 
advocate hedging your bets by saving money in your tax-sheltered retirement 
accounts as well as toward your business venture. An investment in your own small 
business can produce great rewards, so you may feel comfortable focusing your 
savings on your own business.

20      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
Saving for kids’ educational costs
Do you have little ones or plan to have them in your future? You probably know 
that rearing a child (or two) costs really big bucks. But the biggest expense awaits 
when they reach young adulthood and want to go to college, so your instincts may 
be to try to save money to accomplish and afford that goal.
The college financial-aid system effectively penalizes you for saving money out-
side tax-sheltered retirement accounts and penalizes you even more if the money 
is invested in the child’s name. Wanting to provide for your children’s future is 
perfectly natural, but doing so before you’ve saved adequately toward your own 
goals can be a major financial mistake.
This concept may sound selfish, but the reality is that you need to take care of your 
future first. Take advantage of saving through your tax-sheltered retirement 
accounts before you set aside money in custodial savings accounts for your kids.
Investing short-term money
So where should you invest money earmarked for a shorter-term goal? A money 
market account or short-term bond fund is a good place to store your short-term 
savings. See Chapters 7 and 9 for more information on these options. The best bank 
or credit union accounts (covered in Chapter 6) may be worth considering as well.
Investing in Retirement Accounts
During your younger adult years, you may not be thinking much about retirement, 
because it seems to be well off in the distance. But if you’d like to scale back on 
your work schedule someday, partly or completely, you’re best off saving toward 
that goal as soon as you start drawing a regular paycheck.
Maybe the problem with thinking about this goal stems in part with the terminol-
ogy retirement. Perhaps thinking about it in terms of saving and investing to 
achieve financial independence is better.
In this section, I explain the benefits and possible concerns of investing through 
so-called retirement accounts. I also lay out the retirement account options you 
may access.

CHAPTER 2  Using Investments to Accomplish Your Goals      21
Understanding retirement account perks
Where possible, try to save and invest in accounts that offer you a tax advantage, 
which is precisely what retirement accounts offer you. These accounts — known 
by such enlightening acronyms and names as 401(k), 403(b), SEP-IRA, and so 
on — offer tax breaks to people of all economic means. Consider the following 
advantages to investing in retirement accounts:
»
» Contributions often provide up-front tax breaks. By investing through a 
retirement account, you not only plan wisely for your future but also get an 
immediate financial reward: lower taxes, which mean more money available 
for saving and investing. Retirement account contributions generally aren’t 
taxed at either the federal or state income tax level until withdrawal (but 
they’re still subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes when earned). If 
you’re paying, say, 30 percent between federal and state taxes (see Chapter 4 
to determine your tax bracket), a $4,000 contribution to a retirement account 
lowers your income taxes by $1,200.
Modest income earners also may get an additional government tax credit 
known as the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit. A maximum credit of 
50 percent applies to the first $2,000 contributed for single taxpayers with an 
adjusted gross income (AGI) of no more than $18,500 and married couples 
filing jointly with an AGI of $37,000 or less. Singles with an AGI of between 
$18,500 and $20,000 and married couples with an AGI between $37,000 and 
$40,000 are eligible for a 20 percent tax credit. Single taxpayers with an AGI of 
more than $20,000 but no more than $31,000, as well as married couples with 
an AGI between $40,000 and $62,000, can get a 10 percent tax credit.
»
» Your employer may match some of your contributions. This cash is free 
money from your employer, and it’s use it or lose it, so don’t miss out!
»
» Investment returns compound tax-free. After you put money into a 
retirement account, you get to defer taxes on all the accumulating gains and 
profits (including interest and dividends) until you withdraw the money down 
the road. Thus, more money is working for you over a longer period of time. 
(One exception: Roth IRAs offer no up-front tax breaks but permit tax-free 
withdrawal of investment earnings in retirement.)
Grappling with retirement  
account concerns
There are legitimate concerns about putting money into a retirement account. 
First and foremost is the fact that once you place such money inside a retirement 

22      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
account, you can’t generally access it before age 59½ without paying current 
income taxes and a penalty — 10 percent of the withdrawn amount in federal tax, 
plus whatever your state charges.
This poses a problem on several levels. First, money placed inside retirement 
accounts is typically not available for other uses, such as buying a car or starting 
a small business. Second, if an emergency arises and you need to tap the money, 
you’ll get socked with paying current income taxes and penalties on amounts 
withdrawn.
You can use the following ways to avoid the early-withdrawal penalties that the 
tax authorities normally apply:
»
» You can make penalty-free withdrawals of up to $10,000 from IRAs for a 
first-time home purchase or higher educational expenses for you, your 
spouse, or your children (and even grandchildren).
»
» Some company retirement plans allow you to borrow against your balance. 
You’re essentially loaning money to yourself, with the interest payments going 
back into your account.
»
» If you have major medical expenses (exceeding 10.0 percent of your income) 
or a disability, you may be exempt from the penalties under certain condi-
tions. (You will still owe ordinary income tax on withdrawals.)
»
» You may withdraw money before age 59½ if you do so in equal, annual 
installments based on your life expectancy. You generally must make such 
distributions for at least five years or until age 59½, whichever is later.
If you lose your job and withdraw retirement account money simply because you 
need it to live on, the penalties do apply. If you’re not working, however, and 
you’re earning so little income that you need to access your retirement account, 
you would likely be in a low tax bracket. The lower income taxes you pay (com-
pared with the taxes you would have paid on that money had you not sheltered it 
in a retirement account in the first place) should make up for most, if not all, of 
the penalty.
But what about simply wanting to save money for nearer-term goals and to be 
able to tap that money? If you’re saving and investing money for a down payment 
on a home or to start a business, for example, you’ll probably need to save that 
money outside a retirement account to avoid those early-withdrawal penalties.
If you’re like most young adults and have limited financial resources, you need to 
prioritize your goals. Before funding retirement accounts and gaining those tax 

CHAPTER 2  Using Investments to Accomplish Your Goals      23
breaks, be sure to contemplate and prioritize your other goals (see the section 
“Setting and Prioritizing Your Shorter-Term Goals” earlier in this chapter).
Taking advantage of retirement accounts
To take advantage of retirement savings plans and the tax savings that accompany 
them, you must spend less than you earn. Only then can you afford to contribute 
to these retirement savings plans, unless you already happen to have a stash of 
cash from previous savings or an inheritance.
The common mistake that many younger adults make is neglecting to take advan-
tage of retirement accounts because of their enthusiasm for spending or investing 
in nonretirement accounts. Not investing in tax-sheltered retirement accounts 
can cost you hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars per year in lost tax savings. 
Add that loss up over the many years that you work and save, and not taking 
advantage of these tax reduction accounts can easily cost you tens of thousands to 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in the long term.
The sooner you start to save, the less painful it is each year to save enough to 
reach your goals, because your contributions have more years to compound. Each 
decade you delay saving approximately doubles the percentage of your earnings 
that you need to save to meet your goals. If saving 5 percent per year in your early 
20s gets you to your retirement goal, waiting until your 30s to start may mean 
socking away approximately 10 percent to reach that same goal; waiting until your 
40s means saving 20 percent. Start saving now!
Surveying retirement account choices
If you earn employment income (or receive alimony), you have options for putting 
money away in a retirement account that compounds without taxation until you 
withdraw the money. In most cases, your contributions to these retirement 
accounts are tax-deductible. This section reviews your options.
Company-based retirement plans
Larger for-profit companies generally offer their employees a 401(k) plan, which 
typically allows saving up to $18,000 per year (for tax year 2017). Many nonprofit 
organizations offer their employees similar plans, known as 403(b) plans. Contri-
butions to both traditional 401(k) and 403(b) plans are deductible on both your 
federal and state taxes in the year that you make them. Employees of nonprofit 
organizations can generally contribute up to 20 percent or $18,000 of their sala-
ries, whichever is less.

FIGURING HOW MUCH TO SAVE  
FOR RETIREMENT
Among the mass market website tools and booklets focused on retirement planning,  
I like T. Rowe Price’s Retirement Income Calculator available online at www3.trowe 
price.com/ric/ricweb/public/ric.do. It walks you through the calculations 
needed to figure how much you should be saving to reach your retirement goal.
The assumptions that you plug into this and similar calculators are really important, so 
here’s a review of the key ones:
•	 Asset allocation: Enter your current allocation (the portion invested in stocks versus 
bonds) and then select an allocation for after you’re retired. For the retirement allo-
cation, you can choose a fixed combination of 40 percent stock, 40 percent bond,  
20 percent money market fund. The calculator doesn’t include real estate as a possi-
ble asset. If you own real estate as an investment, you should treat those assets as a 
stock-like investment, since they have similar long-term risk and return characteris-
tics. (Calculate your equity in investment real estate, which is the difference between 
a property’s current market value and mortgage debt on that property.)
•	 Age of retirement: Plug in your preferred age of retirement, within reason, of 
course. There’s no point plugging in a dream number like “I’d like to retire by age 
45, but I know the only way I can do that is to win the lottery!” Depending on how 
the analysis works out, you can always go back and plug in a different age. 
Sometimes folks are pleasantly surprised that their combined accumulated 
resources provide them with a decent enough standard of living that they can con-
sider retiring sooner than they thought.
•	 Include Social Security?: T. Rowe’s calculator asks whether you want to include 
expected Social Security benefits. I’d rather that they didn’t pose this question at all, 
because you definitely should include your Social Security benefits in the calcula-
tions. Don’t buy into the nonsense that the Social Security program will vaporize 
and you’ll get little to nothing from it. For the vast majority of people, Social Security 
benefits are an important component of their retirement income, so do include it. 
Based on your current income, T. Rowe Price’s program will automatically plug in 
your estimated benefits. So long as your income hasn’t changed or won’t change 
dramatically, using the calculator’s estimated number should be fine. Alternatively, 
you could use your personal information that you can access on the Social Security 
website at www.ssa.gov.
Price’s analysis allows to you make adjustments such as your desired age of retirement, 
rate of savings, and to what age you’d like your savings to last. So, for example, if the 
analysis shows that you have much more than enough to retire by age 65, try plugging 
in, say, age 62 and voilà, the calculator quickly shows you how the numbers change.

CHAPTER 2  Using Investments to Accomplish Your Goals      25
There’s a benefit in addition to the up-front and ongoing tax benefits of these 
retirement savings plans: Some employers match your contributions. (If you’re an 
employee in a small business, you can establish your own SEP-IRA.) Of course, the 
challenge for many people is to reduce their spending enough to be able to sock 
away these kinds of contributions.
Some employers are offering a Roth 401(k) account, which, like a Roth IRA (dis-
cussed in the next section), offers employees the ability to contribute on an after-
tax basis. Withdrawals from such accounts generally aren’t taxed in retirement.
If you’re self-employed, you can establish your own retirement savings plans for 
yourself and any employees you have. Simplified Employee Pension-Individual 
Retirement Accounts (SEP-IRA) allow you to put away up to 20 percent of your self-
employment income up to an annual maximum of $54,000 (for tax year 2017).
Individual Retirement Accounts
If you work for a company that doesn’t offer a retirement savings plan, or if you’ve 
exhausted contributions to your company’s plan, consider an Individual Retirement 
Account (IRA). Anyone who earns employment income or receives alimony may 
contribute up to $5,500 annually to an IRA (or the amount of your employment 
income or alimony income, if it’s less than $5,500 in a year). A nonworking spouse 
may contribute up to $5,500 annually to a spousal IRA.
Your contributions to an IRA may or may not be tax-deductible. For tax year 2017, 
if you’re single and your adjusted gross income is $62,000 or less for the year, you 
can deduct your full IRA contribution. If you’re married and you file your taxes 
jointly, you’re entitled to a full IRA deduction if your AGI is $99,000 per year or less.
If you can’t deduct your contribution to a standard IRA account, consider making 
a contribution to a nondeductible IRA account called the Roth IRA. Single taxpayers 
with an AGI less than $118,000 and joint filers with an AGI less than $186,000 can 
contribute up to $5,500 per year to a Roth IRA. Although the contribution isn’t 
deductible, earnings inside the account are shielded from taxes, and unlike with-
drawals from a standard IRA, qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA account are 
free from income tax.
Annuities: Maxing out your retirement savings
What if you have so much cash sitting around that after maxing out your contri-
butions to retirement accounts, including your IRA, you still want to sock more 
away into a tax-advantaged account? Enter the annuity. Annuities are contracts 

26      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
that insurance companies back. If you, the investor (annuity holder), should die 
during the so-called accumulation phase (that is, before receiving payments from 
the annuity), your designated beneficiary is guaranteed reimbursement of the 
amount of your original investment.
Annuities, like IRAs, allow your capital to grow and compound tax-deferred. You 
defer taxes until you withdraw the money. Unlike an IRA, which has an annual con-
tribution limit of a few thousand dollars, an annuity allows you to deposit as much 
as you want in any year — even millions of dollars, if you’ve got millions! As with 
a Roth IRA, however, you get no up-front tax deduction for your contributions.
Because annuity contributions aren’t tax-deductible, and because annuities carry 
higher annual operating fees to pay for the small amount of insurance that comes 
with them, don’t consider contributing to one until you’ve fully exhausted your 
other retirement account investing options. Because of their higher annual 
expenses, annuities generally make sense only if you won’t need the money for 15 
or more years.
Selecting retirement account investments
When you establish a retirement account, you may not realize that the retirement 
account is simply a shell or shield that keeps the federal, state, and local govern-
ments from taxing your investment earnings each year. You still must choose 
what investments you want to hold inside your retirement account shell.
You may invest the money in your IRA or self-employed plan retirement account 
(SEP-IRAs and so on) in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and even bank accounts. 
Mutual funds (offered in most employer-based plans) and exchange-traded funds 
(ETFs) are ideal choices because they offer diversification and professional man-
agement. See Chapter 10 for more on mutual funds and ETFs.
Assessing Your Risk-Taking Desires
With money that you’re investing for shorter-term goals, you have a more limited 
menu of investments to choose among. For your emergency/rainy-day fund, for 
example, you should consider only a money market fund or bank/credit union 
savings account. Down-payment money for a home purchase that you expect to 
make in a few years should be kept in short-term bonds.

CHAPTER 2  Using Investments to Accomplish Your Goals      27
When you’re younger and have more years until you plan to use your money, you 
should keep larger amounts of your long-term investment money in growth (own-
ership) investments, such as stocks, real estate, and small business. The attraction 
of these types of investments is their potential to really grow your money, but the 
risk is that the value of such investments can fall significantly.
The younger you are, the more time your investments have to recover from a bad 
fall. A long-held guiding principle says to subtract your age from 110 and invest 
the resulting number as a percentage of money to place in growth (ownership) 
investments. So if you’re 30 years old,
110
30
80 percent in growth investments
Should you want to be more conservative, subtract your age from 100:
100
30
70 percent in growth investments
Want to be even more aggressive? Subtract your age from 120:
120
30
90 percent in growth investments
These guidelines are general ones that apply to money that you invest for the long 
term (ideally, for ten years or more).

Setting Your Return 
Expectations
W
e invest to earn returns. In my experience as a former financial advisor 
and as a writer interacting with many folks, I still find it noteworthy 
how many people have unrealistic and inaccurate return expectations 
for particular investments.
Where do these silly numbers come from? There are numerous sources, most of 
which have a vested interest in convincing you that you can earn really high 
returns if you simply buy what they’re selling. Examples include newsletter 
­writers, some financial advisors, and various financial publishing outlets.
Interestingly, and not surprisingly, less experienced groups of investors (for 
example, young investors just beginning to invest) tend to have higher and more 
unrealistic return expectations. In this chapter, I reveal the actual returns you 
can reasonably expect from common investments. I also illustrate the power of 
compounding those returns over the years and decades ahead, and I show you 
why you won’t need superhuman returns to accomplish your personal and 
financial goals.

30      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
Estimating Your Investments’ Returns
When examining expected investment returns, you have to be careful because 
you’re largely using historic returns as a guide. Using history to predict the future, 
especially the near future, is dangerous. History may repeat itself, but not always 
in exactly the same fashion and not necessarily when you expect it to.
Historical returns should be used only as a guide, not viewed as a guarantee. 
Please keep that in mind as I discuss the returns on money market funds and 
­savings accounts, bonds, stocks, real estate, and small-business investments in 
this section.
Money market funds and  
savings account returns
Be sure to keep your extra cash that awaits investment (or an emergency) in a safe 
place, preferably one that doesn’t get hammered by the sea of changes in the 
financial markets. By default and for convenience, many people keep their extra 
cash in a bank savings account, which tends to pay relatively low rates of interest. 
Banks accounts come with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) backing, 
which costs the bank some money.
Another place to keep your liquid savings is a money market mutual fund. These 
funds are the safest types of mutual funds around and, for all intents and 
­purposes, comparable to a bank savings account’s safety. Technically, money 
market mutual funds don’t carry FDIC insurance. To date, however, only one 
money market fund has lost money for retail shareholders (and in that case, it 
amounted to less then 1 percent).
The best money market funds generally pay higher yields than most bank savings 
accounts (although this has been less true in recent years, with low overall inter-
est rates). When shopping for a money fund, be sure to pay close attention to the 
fund’s expense ratio, because lower expenses generally translate into higher 
yields. If you’re in a higher tax bracket, you should also consider tax-free money 
market funds. (See Chapter 7 for all the details on money market funds.)
If you don’t need immediate access to your money, consider using Treasury bills 
(T-bills) or bank certificates of deposit (CDs), which are usually issued by banks 
for terms such as 3, 6, or 12 months. The drawback to T-bills and bank certificates 
of deposit is that you generally incur a transaction fee (with T-bills) or a penalty 
(with CDs) if you withdraw your investment before the T-bill matures or the CD’s 
term expires. If you can let your money sit for the full term, you can generally earn 

CHAPTER 3  Setting Your Return Expectations      31
more in CDs and T-bills than in a bank savings account. Rates vary by bank, how-
ever, so be sure to shop around.
Bond returns
When you purchase a bond, you should earn a higher yield than you can with a 
money market or savings account. You’re taking more risk because some bond 
issuers (such as corporations) aren’t always able to fully pay back all that they 
borrow.
By investing in a bond (at least when it’s originally issued), you’re effectively 
lending your money to the issuer of that bond (borrower), which is generally the 
federal government or a corporation, for a specific period of time. Companies can 
and do go bankrupt, in which case you may lose some or all of your investment. 
Government debt can go into default as well. You should get paid in the form of a 
higher yield for taking on more risk when you buy bonds that have a lower credit 
rating. (See Chapter 9 for more information on bonds, including how to invest in 
a diversified portfolio of relatively safe bonds.)
Jeremy Siegel, who is a professor of finance at the Wharton School at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, has tracked the performance of bonds (and stocks) for more 
than two centuries! His research has found that bond investors generally earn 
about 4 to 5 percent per year on average.
Returns, of course, fluctuate from year to year and are influenced by inflation 
(increases in the cost of living). Generally speaking, increases in the rate of infla-
tion, especially when those increases weren’t expected, erode bond returns.
Consider a government bond that was issued at an interest rate of 4 percent when 
inflation was running at just 2 percent. Thus, an investor in that bond was able to 
enjoy a 2 percent return after inflation, or what’s known as the real return — real 
meaning after inflation is subtracted. Now, if inflation jumps to, say, 6 percent 
per year, why would folks want to buy your crummy 4 percent bond? They 
wouldn’t, unless the price drops enough to raise the effective yield higher.
Longer-term bonds generally yield more than shorter-term bonds, because 
they’re considered to be riskier due to the longer period until they pay back their 
principal. What are the risks of holding a bond for more years? There’s more time 
for the credit quality of the bond to deteriorate (and for the bond to default), and 
there’s also more time for inflation to come back and erode the purchasing power 
of the bond.

32      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
Stock returns
The long-term returns from stocks that investors have enjoyed, and continue to 
enjoy, have been remarkably constant from one generation to the next. Since 
1802, the U.S. stock market has returned an annual average of about 6 to 7 percent 
per year above the rate of inflation. That’s a remarkable track record, but don’t 
forget that it’s an annual average return.
Stocks have significant downdrafts and can easily drop 10, 20, or 30 or more per-
cent in relatively short periods of time. Stocks can also rise dramatically in value 
over short periods. The keys to making money in stocks are to be diversified, to 
invest consistently, and to own stocks over the long run.
Stocks exist worldwide, of course, not just in the United States. When investing in 
stocks, go global for diversification purposes. International (non-U.S.) stocks 
don’t always move in tandem with U.S. stocks. As a result, overseas stocks help 
diversify your portfolio. In addition to enabling U.S. investors to diversify, invest-
ing overseas has proven to be profitable over the years and decades.
Now, some folks make stock investing riskier than need be by doing some foolish 
things:
»
» Chasing after specific stocks or sectors that have recently been hot: Yes, 
what a rich genius you’d have been if you’d invested in Apple stock (or Google, 
Amazon, or Facebook) when it went public. With the benefit of hindsight, it’s 
easy to spot the “best” stock investments (companies or sectors) over specific 
periods. It’s quite another thing to put your money on the line now and to 
hope and expect that you have the ability to pick the best-performing stocks 
of the future.
»
» Excessive trading and market timing: Another type of wishful thinking 
occurs when folks would like to believe that they can jump into and out of the 
market at the right times to participate in moves higher and to sidestep 
downturns.
Chapter 8 goes into detail on stocks, explaining how to invest in them successfully 
and not lose your shirt.
Real estate returns
Just before, during, and for some time after the financial crisis of 2008 and asso-
ciated severe recession, most types of real estate in most parts of the country 
declined in value. Thus, you may think that real estate isn’t a good investment, 
but you’d be wrong.

CHAPTER 3  Setting Your Return Expectations      33
Real estate is a solid long-term investment. Real estate, as an investment, has 
produced returns comparable to those of investing in the stock market. Both 
stocks and real estate have down periods but have historically produced attractive 
long-term returns. Overall, real estate prices in most parts of the United States 
now have bounced back to record high levels.
Real estate does well in the long run because of growth in the economy, in jobs, 
and in population. Real estate prices in and near major metropolises and suburbs 
generally appreciate the most because people and businesses tend to cluster in 
those areas.
I’d like to make an important caution here about viewing a home in which you live 
solely as an investment. As I discuss in Chapter 12, your primary reason to buy and 
own a home should not be high expected investment returns, because you won’t 
be earning rental income if you live in your own home. That’s why you should 
thoroughly understand the effect that owning a home will have on your monthly 
spending and budget. (Investment real estate examples include a small apartment 
building and retail space.)
IS HIGHER ECONOMIC GROWTH 
BETTER FOR STOCK PRICES?
Stocks for the Long Run (McGraw-Hill) author Jeremy Siegel makes a surprising statement 
in his book: “. . .economic growth has nowhere near as big an impact on stock returns 
as most investors believe.” Siegel presents a long-term analysis going back to 1900, 
which shows that a country’s real GDP growth (that is, growth above the rate of 
­inflation) is negatively correlated with stock market returns.
This surprising finding means that those economies experiencing higher rates of growth 
actually tend to produce lower long-term stock market returns. Siegel’s analysis shows 
that this fact is even more pronounced in developing countries. China is a recent 
­example of a country that has enjoyed fast rates of growth but relatively low stock 
market returns.
In explaining how this reality could possibly be, Siegel points out that the primary 
­determinants of stock prices are earnings per-share and dividends per-share. Economic 
growth doesn’t necessarily boost earnings and dividends per-share because growth 
requires higher capital expenditures, and as Siegel points out, this capital does not 
come freely. “The added interest costs in the case of debt financing and the dilution 
of earnings in the case of equity financing reduce the growth of earnings per share,” 
says Siegel.

34      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
Small-business returns
When we think of the “American dream,” one image that comes to the minds of 
many folks is owning their own business and possibly making it big by doing so.
You have numerous choices for tapping into the rewards of the small-business 
world. If you have the drive and determination, you can start your own small 
business. Or perhaps you have what it takes to buy an existing small business. If 
you obtain the necessary capital and skills to assess opportunities and risk, you 
can invest in someone else’s small business. None of these avenues is easy. In fact, 
all these routes require drive, determination, and some skills and money (more on 
this in Chapter 14).
By starting a small business and retaining a major ownership stake, you can earn 
very high effective returns. Unlike with the stock market, for which plenty of 
­historic rate-of-return data exists, no specific data exists on the returns that 
small-time investors have had from investing in small private companies. (We do 
know that successful venture capital firms, which invest in small businesses with 
large potential, earn generous returns for the general partners.)
While the financial rewards can be attractive, there are other rewards from invest-
ing in small businesses. In my small-business ventures, for example, I’ve enjoyed 
designing and running businesses that provide useful and valued services. I also 
enjoy having flexible work hours and not feeling like I’m punching a time clock to 
satisfy a boss.
Compounding Your Returns
If you’ve read this chapter up to this point, you see that I’ve discussed the historic 
investment returns on common investments. To summarize: During the past cen-
tury, stocks and investment real estate returned around 9 percent per year, bonds 
around 5 percent, and savings accounts about 4 percent.
This section illustrates how compounding seemingly modest investment returns 
can help you accumulate a substantial sum of money to help you accomplish your 
personal and financial goals.
The value of getting a few extra percent
As I discuss in Chapter 1, investing in the stock market (and real estate) can be 
risky, which logically raises the question of whether investing in stocks and real 

CHAPTER 3  Setting Your Return Expectations      35
estate is worth the anxiety and potential losses. Why bother for a few extra 
­percent per year?
Here’s a good answer to that sensible question: Over many years, a few extra 
­percent per year will increase your nest egg dramatically. The more years you have 
to invest, the greater the difference a few percent makes in your returns (see 
Table 3-1).
These numbers are simply amazing! Start first with the 25 year column in 
Table 3-1. For every $1,000 invested over 25 years, you’ll have $1,282 at a 1 percent 
annual return. At a 9 percent return, you’ll have $8,623, or nearly seven times as 
much! Now look at what happens over 40 years. At a 9 percent investment return, 
you’ll have more than 21 times as much money versus what you’d have with a 
1 percent annual investment return.
Here’s a practical example to show you what a major difference earning a few 
extra percent can make in accomplishing your financial goals. Consider a 
30-year-old investor who’s saving toward financial independence/retirement on 
his $40,000 annual salary. Suppose that his goal is to retire by age 67 with about 
$30,000 per year to live on (in today’s dollars), which would be about 75 percent 
of his working salary.
If he begins saving at age 30, he needs to save about $460 per month if you assume 
that he earns about 5 percent per year average return on his investments. That’s

a big chunk to save each year (about $5,500) — amounting to about 14 percent of 
his gross (pretax) salary.
But what if this investor can earn just a few percent more per year on average 
from his investments — 8 percent instead of just 5 percent? In that case, he could 
accomplish the same goal by saving just half as much: $230 per month (or 
$2,800 per year)!
Considering your goals
How much do you need or want to earn? You have to balance your goals with how 
you feel about risk. Some people can’t handle higher-risk investments. Although 
investing in stocks, real estate, or small business can produce high long-term 
returns, investing in these vehicles comes with greater risk, especially over the 
short term.
Others are at a time in their lives when they can’t afford to take great risk. If 
you’re still in school, if you’ve lost your job, or if you’re starting a family, your 
portfolio and nerves may not be able to wait a decade for your riskier investments 
to recover after a major stumble.
If you work for a living, odds are that you need and want to make your invest-
ments grow at a healthy clip. Should your investments grow slowly, you may fall 
short of your goals of owning a home or retiring or changing careers.
All this is to say that you should take the time to contemplate, enumerate, and 
prioritize your personal and financial goals. If you haven’t already sorted 
them out, see Chapter 2 to get started.

Minimizing Your Taxes 
When Investing
Y
ou should pay attention to tax issues when making investing decisions. 
Actually, let me rephrase that. Like plenty of other folks, you could ignore or 
pay half attention to taxes on your investments. Unless you enjoy paying 
more taxes, however, you should understand and consider tax ramifications when 
choosing and managing your investments over the years.
Tax considerations alone shouldn’t dictate how and where you invest your money. 
You should also weigh investment choices, your desire and the necessity to take 
risk, personal likes and dislikes, and the number of years you plan to hold the 
investment.
In this chapter, I explain how the different components of investment returns are 
taxed. I also present proven up-to-date strategies to minimize your investment 
taxes and maximize your returns. Finally, I discuss tax considerations when sell-
ing an investment.

38      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
Understanding Investment Taxes
When you invest outside tax-sheltered retirement accounts, the profits and distri-
butions on your money are subject to taxation. (Distributions are taxed in the year 
that they are paid out; appreciation is taxed only when you sell an investment at a 
profit.) So the non-retirement-account investments that make sense for you 
depend (at least partly) on your tax situation.
Tracking taxation of investment  
distributions
The distributions that various investments pay out and the profits that you may 
make are often taxable, but in some cases, they’re not. It’s important to remember 
that it’s not what you make pretax on an investment that matters, but what you 
get to keep after taxes.
Interest you receive from bank accounts and corporate bonds is generally taxable. 
U.S. Treasury bonds, which are issued by the U.S. federal government, pay interest 
that’s state-tax-free but federally taxable.
Municipal bonds, which state and local governments issue, pay interest that’s fed-
erally tax-free and also state-tax-free to residents in the state where the bond is 
issued. (For more on bonds, see Chapter 9.)
Taxation on your capital gains, which is the profit (sales price minus purchase 
price) on an investment, is computed under a unique system. Investments held 
less than one year generate short-term capital gains, which are taxed at your nor-
mal marginal income tax rate (which I explain in the next section).
Profits from investments that you hold longer than 12 months are long-term capi-
tal gains. Under current tax law, these long-term gains are taxed at a maximum 
20 percent rate, except for folks in the two lowest income tax brackets: 10 percent 
and 15 percent. For these folks, the long-term capital gains tax rate is 0 percent (as 
in nothing). Dividends paid out on stock are also taxed at the same favorable long-
term capital gains tax rates under current tax law.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (informally referred to as 
­Obamacare) increased the tax rate on the net investment income for taxpayers 
with adjusted gross income above $200,000 (single return) or $250,000 (joint 
return). Net investment income includes interest, dividends, and capital gains. The 
increased tax rate is 3.8 percent. During 2017, efforts were underway to possibly 

CHAPTER 4  Minimizing Your Taxes When Investing      39
repeal and replace Obamacare and its associated taxes, but at the time of publica-
tion, no changes had been made.
Determining your tax bracket
Many folks don’t realize it, but the federal government (like most state govern-
ments) charges you different income tax rates for different parts of your annual 
income. You pay less tax on the first dollars of your earnings and more tax on the 
last dollars of your earnings.
Your federal marginal income tax rate is the rate of tax that you pay on your last, or 
so-called highest, dollars of income (see Table 4-1). Your taxable income is the 
income that is left after taking allowed deductions on your return.
Your actual marginal tax rate includes state income taxes if your state levies an 
income tax. Though this chapter focuses upon the federal income tax system and 
strategies to reduce those taxes, most of what is discussed also helps you reduce 
your state income taxes, which the vast majority of states levy. Each state income 
tax system is unique, so covering them all here is impossible. All but seven states —

There’s value in knowing your marginal tax rate. This knowledge allows you to 
determine the following (among other things):
»
» How much you could reduce your taxes if you contribute more money to 
retirement accounts
»
» How much you would pay in additional taxes on extra income you could earn 
from working more
»
» How much you could reduce your taxable income if you use investments that 
produce tax-free income (which might make sense only if you’re in a higher tax 
bracket — more on this later in the chapter)

Paying attention to the 2017  
Congressional tax bill
As this book went to press in the fall of 2017, the president and his administration 
had been promising a significant tax bill that would likely reduce the number of 
individual tax brackets and reduce the taxes paid by non-high income earners. 
Also discussed was reforming and lowering corportate income tax rates to bring 
those in line with other developed countries.
It has been hard to assess the likelihood of such a tax bill passing, especially since  
it still hasn’t been introduced after early 2017 promises that a bill would have 
been passed and signed into law by now. For updates, please visit my website at 
www.erictyson.com.
Devising tax-reduction strategies
Use these strategies to reduce the taxes you pay on investments that are exposed 
to taxation:
»
» Make use of retirement accounts and health savings accounts. Most 
contributions to retirement accounts gain you an immediate tax break, and 
once they’re inside the account, investment returns are sheltered from 
taxation, generally until withdrawal. Think of these as tax reduction accounts 
that will help you work toward achieving financial independence. See 
Chapter 2 for details on using retirement accounts when investing.

CHAPTER 4  Minimizing Your Taxes When Investing      41
Similar to retirement accounts are health savings accounts (HSAs). With HSAs, 
you get a tax break on your contributions up front; investment earnings 
compound without taxation over time; and there’s no tax on withdrawal so 
long as the money is used to pay for health-related expenses (as delineated by 
the IRS).
»
» Consider tax-free money market funds and tax-free bond funds. Tax-free 
investments yield less than comparable investments that produce taxable 
earnings, but because of the tax differences, the earnings from tax-free 
investments can end up being greater than what taxable investments leave 
you with. If you’re in a high-enough tax bracket, you may find that you come 
out ahead with tax-free investments.
For a proper comparison, subtract what you’ll pay in federal and state income 
taxes from the taxable investment income to see which investment nets you 
more.
»
» Invest in tax-friendly stock funds. Mutual funds that tend to trade less tend 
to produce lower capital gains distributions. For mutual funds held outside 
tax-sheltered retirement accounts, this reduced trading effectively increases 
an investor’s total rate of return. Index funds are mutual funds that invest in a 
relatively static portfolio of securities, such as stocks and bonds. (This is also 
true of some exchange-traded funds.) They don’t attempt to beat the market; 
rather, they invest in the securities to mirror or match the performance of an 
underlying index. Although index funds can’t beat the market, the typical 
actively managed fund doesn’t, either, and index funds have several advan-
tages over actively managed funds. See Chapter 10 to find out more about 
tax-friendly stock mutual funds, including some nonindex funds and exchange-
traded funds.
»
» Invest in small business and real estate. The growth in value of business 
and real estate assets isn’t taxed until you sell the asset. Even then, with 
investment real estate, you often can roll over the gain into another property 
as long as you comply with tax laws. Increases in value in small businesses can 
qualify for the more favorable longer-term capital gains tax rate and poten-
tially for other tax breaks. However, the current income that small business 
and real estate assets produce is taxed as ordinary income.
Short-term capital gains (investments held one year or less) are taxed at your 
ordinary income tax rate. This fact is another reason why you shouldn’t trade your 
investments quickly (within 12 months).

42      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
Reducing Your Taxes When  
Selling Investments
I advocate doing your homework so you can purchase and hold on to good invest-
ments for many years and even decades. That said, each year, folks sell and trade 
lots of investments.
My experience in helping people get a handle on their investments suggests that 
too many investors sell for the wrong reasons (while other investors hold on to 
investments for far too long and should sell them).
In this section, I highlight important tax and other issues to consider when you 
contemplate selling your investments, but I start with the nontax, bigger-picture 
considerations.
Weighing nontax issues
Although the focus of this chapter is on tax issues to consider when making, man-
aging, and selling your investments, I’d be remiss not to raise bigger-picture 
considerations:
»
» Meeting your goals and preferences: If your life has changed (or if you’ve 
inherited investments) since the last time you took a good look at your 
investment portfolio, you may discover that your current holdings no longer 
make sense for you. To avoid wasting time and money on investments that 
aren’t good for you, be sure to review your investments at least annually.
Don’t make quick decisions about selling. Instead, take your time, and be sure 
you understand tax and other ramifications before you sell.
»
» Keeping the right portfolio mix: A good reason to sell an investment is to 
allow yourself to better diversify your portfolio. Suppose that through your 
job, you’ve accumulated such a hefty chunk of stock in your employer that 
this stock now overwhelms the rest of your investments. Or perhaps you’ve 
simply kept your extra money in a bank account or inherited stock from a 
dear relative. Conservative investors often keep too much of their money in 
bank accounts, Treasury bills, and the like. If your situation is like these, it’s 
time for you to diversify. Sell some of the holdings of which you have too 
much, and invest the proceeds in some of the solid investments that I 
recommend in this book.

CHAPTER 4  Minimizing Your Taxes When Investing      43
If you think your employer’s stock is going to be a superior investment, holding 
a big chunk is your gamble. At minimum, review Chapter 8 to see how to 
evaluate a particular stock. Remember to consider the consequences if you’re 
wrong about your employer’s stock. Develop an overall investment strategy 
that fits your personal financial situation (see Chapter 5).
»
» Deciding which investments are keepers: Often, people are tempted to sell 
an investment for the wrong reasons. One natural tendency is to want to sell 
investments that have declined in value. Some people fear a further fall, and 
they don’t want to be affiliated with a loser, especially when money is involved. 
Instead, step back, take some deep breaths, and examine the merits of the 
investment you’re considering selling. If an investment is otherwise still sound 
per the guidelines I discuss in this book, why bail out when prices are down 
and a sale is going on? What are you going to do with the money? If anything, 
you should be contemplating buying more of such an investment.
Also, don’t make a decision to sell based on your current emotional response, 
especially to recent news events. If bad news has hit recently, it’s already old 
news. Don’t base your investment holdings on such transitory events. Use the 
criteria in this book for finding good investments to evaluate the worthiness of 
your current holdings. If an investment is fundamentally sound, don’t sell it.
Tuning in to tax considerations
When you sell investments that you hold outside a tax-sheltered retirement 
account, such as in an IRA or a 401(k), taxes should be one factor in your decision. 
If the investments are inside retirement accounts, taxes aren’t an issue because 
the accounts are sheltered from taxation until you withdraw funds from them.
Just because you pay tax on a profit from selling a non-retirement-account invest-
ment doesn’t mean you should avoid selling. With real estate that you buy directly, 
as opposed to publicly held securities like real estate investment trusts (REITs), 
you can often avoid paying taxes on the profit you make. (See Chapter 12 for more 
information.)
With stocks and mutual funds, you can specify which shares you want to sell. This 
option makes selling decisions more complicated, but you may want to consider 
specifying what shares you’re selling because you may be able to save taxes. (Read 
the next section for more information on this option.) If you sell all your shares of 
a particular security that you own, you don’t need to concern yourself with speci-
fying which shares you’re selling.

44      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
Determining the cost basis of your shares
When you sell a portion of the shares of a security (such as a stock, bond, or mutual 
fund) that you own, specifying which shares you’re selling may benefit you tax 
wise. Here’s an example to show you why you may want to specify selling certain 
shares — especially those shares that cost you more to buy — so you can save on 
your taxes.
Suppose you own 300 shares of a stock, and you want to sell 100 shares. You bought 
100 of these shares a long, long time ago at $10 per share, 100 shares two years ago 
at $16 per share, and the last 100 shares one year ago at $14 per share. Today, the 
stock is at $20 per share. Although you didn’t get rich, you’re grateful that you 
haven’t lost your shirt the way some of your stock-picking pals have.
The good tax folks at the Internal Revenue Service allow you to choose which 
shares you want to sell. Electing to sell the 100 shares that you purchased at the 
highest price — those you bought for $16 per share two years ago — saves you in 
taxes. To comply with the tax laws, you must identify the shares that you want the 
broker to sell by the original date of purchase and/or the cost when you sell the 
shares. The brokerage firm through which you sell the stock should include this 
information on the confirmation that you receive for the sale.
The other method of accounting for which shares are sold is the method that the 
IRS forces you to use if you don’t specify before the sale which shares you want to 
sell — the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. FIFO means that the first shares that you 
sell are simply the first shares that you bought. Not surprisingly, because most 
stocks appreciate over time, the FIFO method usually leads to your paying more tax 
sooner. The FIFO accounting procedure leads to the conclusion that the 100 shares 
you sell are the 100 that you bought long, long ago at $10 per share. Thus, you owe 
a larger amount of taxes than if you’d sold the higher-cost shares under the speci-
fication method.
Although you save taxes today if you specify selling the shares that you bought 
more recently at a higher price, when you finally sell the other shares, you’ll owe 
taxes on the larger profit. The longer you expect to hold these other shares, the 
greater the value you’ll likely derive from postponing, realizing the larger gains 
and paying more in taxes.
When you sell shares in a mutual fund, the IRS has yet another accounting method, 
known as the average cost method, for figuring your taxable profit or loss. This 
method comes in handy if you bought shares in chunks over time or reinvested the 
fund payouts in purchasing more shares of the fund. As the name suggests, the 
average cost method allows you to take an average cost for all the mutual fund 
shares you bought over time.

CHAPTER 4  Minimizing Your Taxes When Investing      45
Selling large-profit investments
No one likes to pay taxes, of course, but if an investment you own has appreciated 
in value, someday you’ll have to pay taxes on it when you sell. (There is an excep-
tion: You hold the investment until your death and will it to your heirs. The IRS 
wipes out the capital gains tax on appreciated assets at your death.)
Capital gains tax applies when you sell an investment at a higher price than you 
paid for it. As I explain earlier in this chapter, your capital gains tax rate is differ-
ent from the tax rate that you pay on ordinary income (such as from employment 
earnings or interest on bank savings accounts).
Odds are that the longer you’ve held securities such as stocks, the greater the capi-
tal gains you’ll have, because stocks tend to appreciate over time. If all your assets 
have appreciated significantly, you may resist selling to avoid taxes. If you need 
money for a major purchase, however, sell what you need and pay the tax. Even if 
you have to pay state as well as federal taxes totaling some 35 percent of the profit, 
you’ll have lots left. (For “longer-term” profits from investments held more than 
one year, your federal and state capital gains taxes probably would total less than 
20 percent to 25 percent.)
Before you sell, do some rough figuring to make sure you’ll have enough money 
left to accomplish what you want. If you seek to sell one investment and reinvest 
in another, you’ll owe tax on the profit unless you’re selling and rebuying real 
estate (see Chapter 12).
If you hold several assets, to diversify and meet your other financial goals, give 
preference to selling your largest holdings with the smallest capital gains. If you 
have some securities that have profits and some with losses, you can sell some of 
each to offset the profits with the losses.
Handling losers in your portfolio
Perhaps you have some losers in your portfolio. If you need to raise cash for some 
particular reason, you may consider selling select securities at a loss. You can use 
losses to offset gains as long as you hold both offsetting securities for more than 
one year (long term) or hold both for no more than one year (short term). The IRS 
makes this delineation because it taxes long-term gains and losses on a different 
rate schedule from short-term gains and losses.
If you sell securities at a loss, you can claim up to $3,000 in net losses for the year 
on your federal income tax return. If you sell securities with net losses totaling 
more than $3,000 in a year, you must carry the losses over to future tax years. This 
situation not only creates more tax paperwork but also delays realizing the value 

46      PART 1  Getting Started with Investing
of deducting a tax loss. Try not to have net losses (losses + gains) that exceed 
$3,000 in a year.
Some tax advisors advocate doing year-end tax-loss selling with stocks, bonds, 
and mutual funds. The logic goes that if you hold a security at a loss, you should 
sell it, take the tax write-off, and then buy it (or something similar) back. When 
selling investments for tax-loss purposes, be careful of the so-called wash sale 
rules. The IRS doesn’t allow the deduction of a loss for a security sale if you buy 
that same security back within 30 days. As long as you wait 31 or more days, you 
won’t encounter any problems.
If you’re selling a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, you can purchase a fund 
similar to the one you’re selling to easily sidestep this rule.
Selling investments when you don’t  
know their original cost
Sometimes, you may not know what an investment originally cost you, or you 
received some investments from another person, and you’re not sure what he or 
she paid for them.
If you don’t have the original statement, start by calling the firm where the invest-
ment was purchased. Whether it’s a brokerage firm or mutual fund company, the 
company should be able to send you copies of old account statements, although 
you may have to pay a small fee for this service.
Also, increasing numbers of investment firms, especially mutual fund companies, 
can tell you upon the sale of an investment what its original cost was. The cost 
calculated is usually the average cost for the shares you purchased.

Financial Plans
M
ost folks love to pick an investment, put their money into it, and then 
enjoy seeing it increase in value. And though I try to simplify and clearly 
explain investing, it isn’t that easy. You can do your homework and make 
a good decision but then see your well-chosen investment fall in value and test 
your nerves.
But that’s putting the cart before the horse. Before you make any great, wealth-
building investments, you should get your financial house in order. Understand-
ing and implementing some simple personal financial management concepts can 
pay off big for you in the decades ahead.
In this chapter, I explain what financial housekeeping you should do before you 
invest, as well as how to translate your overall personal and financial plans into 
an investment plan.

50      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
First Priorities: Paying Off High-Cost Debt 
and Building a Safety Reserve
Plenty of younger folks have debts to pay and lack an emergency reserve of money 
for unexpected expenses. High-cost debts, such as on a credit card, can be a major 
impediment to investing, in particular, and accomplishing your future personal 
and financial goals, in a broader sense. A high interest rate keeps the debt growing 
and can cause your debt to spiral out of control, which is why I discuss dealing 
with such consumer debt as your first priority, just before establishing an emer-
gency reserve.
Paying off high-cost consumer debt
Paying down debts isn’t nearly as exciting as investing, but it can make your 
investment decisions less difficult. Rather than spending your time investigating 
specific investments, paying off your debts with money you’ve saved may indeed 
be your best investment.
Consumer debt includes borrowing on credit cards, auto loans, and the like, which 
are often costly ways to borrow. Banks and other lenders charge higher interest 
rates for consumer debt than for debt for investments, such as real estate and 
business, because consumer loans are the riskiest type of loans for a lender. Risk 
means the chance of the borrower’s defaulting and being unable to pay back all 
that he or she borrowed.
Many folks have credit card debt that costs 18 percent or more per year in interest. 
Some credit cards levy interest rates well above 20 percent if you make a late pay-
ment or two. Reducing and eventually eliminating this debt with your savings is 
like putting your money in an investment with a guaranteed tax-free return equal 
to the rate that you pay on your debt.
For example, if you have outstanding credit card debt at 18 percent interest, pay-
ing off that debt is the same as putting your money to work in an investment with 
a guaranteed 18 percent tax-free annual return. Because the interest on consumer 
debt isn’t tax-deductible, you would need to earn more than 18 percent by invest-
ing your money elsewhere to net 18 percent after paying taxes. Earning such high 
investing returns is highly unlikely, and to earn those returns, you’d be forced to 
take great risk.
Consumer debt is hazardous to your long-term financial health (not to mention 
damaging to your credit score and future ability to borrow for a home or other 
wise investments) because it encourages you to borrow against your future earn-
ings. I often hear people say such things as “I can’t afford to buy a new car for 

CHAPTER 5  Laying Out Your Financial Plans      51
cash, given how expensive cars are.” Well, okay. New cars are expensive, so you 
need to set your sights lower and buy a good used car that you can afford. You can 
then invest the money that you’d otherwise spend on your auto loan.
Now, I do “recommend” one exception to my guideline of not borrowing through 
a credit card: Tapping credit card debt may make sense if you’re financing a busi-
ness. If you don’t have home equity, personal loans (through a credit card or auto 
loan) may actually be your lowest-cost source of small-business financing (see 
Chapter 14 for more information).
Establishing an emergency reserve
You never know what life will bring, so having an accessible reserve of cash to 
meet unexpected expenses makes good financial sense. If you have generous par-
ents or dear relatives, you can certainly consider using them as your emergency 
reserve. Just be sure you ask them in advance how they feel about that before you 
count on receiving funding from them. If you don’t have a financially flush family 
member, the onus is on you to establish a reserve.
I generally recommend that you have at least three months’ worth of living 
expenses to as much as six months’ worth of living expenses as an emergency 
reserve. Invest this personal-safety-net money in a money market fund (see 
Chapter 7). You may also be able to borrow against your employer-based retire-
ment account or against your home equity, should you find yourself in a bind, but 
these options are much less desirable.
If you don’t have a financial safety net, you may be forced, under duress, to sell an 
investment (at a relatively low price) that you’ve worked hard for. And selling 
some investments, such as real estate, can take time and cost significant money 
(transaction costs, taxes, and so on).
Riskier investments like stocks aren’t a suitable place to keep your emergency 
money invested. While stocks historically have returned about 9 percent per year 
(see Chapter 3), about one-third of the time, stocks decline in value in a given 
year, sometimes substantially. Stocks can drop and have dropped 20, 30, or 
50 percent or more over relatively short periods of time. Suppose that such a 
decline coincides with an emergency, such as the loss of your job or a health prob-
lem that creates major medical bills. Your situation may force you to sell at a loss, 
perhaps a substantial one. As I discuss in Chapter 8, stocks are intended to be a 
longer-term investment, not an investment that you expect (or need) to sell in the 
near future.

52      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
What about Paying Down Other Debts?
Getting out from under 18 percent interest rate credit card debt is clearly a priority 
and a bit of a no-brainer. But what should you do about other debts that carry a 
more reasonable interest rate? This section talks you through some common 
examples: student loans and mortgage debt.
Assessing student loans
If you’re one of many young adults with lingering student loan debt, you’re prob-
ably wondering whether you should focus your efforts on paying down that debt 
or instead invest the extra cash you have.
The best choice hinges on the interest rate on this debt (after factoring in any tax 
breaks) and how that compares with the expected return from investing. Of 
course, you must be reasonable and not pie-in-the-sky about the rate of return 
you expect from your investments.
Under current tax laws, with student loans, you can deduct up to $2,500 in stu-
dent loan interest annually on your federal 1040 income tax return. So this deduc-
tion can lower the effective interest rate you’re paying on your student loans. This 
deduction is available to single taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes (before 
subtracting the student loan interest) of $65,000 or less and married couples fil-
ing jointly with such incomes of $135,000 or less. Partial deductions are allowed 
for incomes up to $80,000 for singles and $165,000 for married couples filing 
jointly. Another requirement for taking this deduction is that you and your spouse, 
if filing jointly, cannot be claimed as dependents on someone else’s income tax 
return.
If you can deduct student loan interest on your tax return, to determine the value 
of that deduction, please see Chapter 4 to understand what tax bracket you’re in 
(what your marginal tax rate is). For most moderate income earners, 25 percent is 
a reasonable number to work with.
Suppose you have student loans outstanding at the attractive interest rate of just 
3.5 percent. Assume that you’re able to deduct all this interest and that your 
income tax bracket is 25 percent. So after taxes, the effective interest rate on your 
student loan is 3 5
0 25

Now, the question to consider is this: Can you reasonably expect to earn an aver-
age annual rate of return from your investments of more than this 2.63 percent? 
If you invest your money in a sleepy bank account, the answer will probably be no. 
If you instead invest in things like stocks and bonds, over the long term, you 
should come out with a higher return.

CHAPTER 5  Laying Out Your Financial Plans      53
If you have student loans at a higher interest rate — say, 6 percent — it may make 
more sense to pay those loans down faster with your extra cash than to invest that 
money elsewhere. To get a higher return than that from investments, you need to 
take a fair amount of risk, and of course there’s no guarantee that you’ll actually 
make a high enough return to make it worth your while.
When deciding whether you should pay down student loans faster, there are some 
factors to consider besides the cost of your student loans and comparing this cost 
to the expected return on your investments. Other good reasons not to pay off 
your student loans any quicker than necessary include the following:
»
» Paying off your student loan faster has no tax benefit. Instead, you could 
contribute to your retirement (also known as tax reduction) accounts, such as 
a 401(k), an IRA, or a SEP-IRA plan (especially if your employer offers matching 
money). Putting additional money in a retirement plan can immediately 
reduce your federal and state income tax bills. The more years you have until 
retirement, the greater the benefit you receive if you invest in your retirement 
accounts. Thanks to the compounding of your retirement account investments 
without the drain of taxes, you can actually earn a lower rate of return on your 
investments than you pay on your student loans and still come out ahead.
»
» You’re willing to invest in growth-oriented, volatile investments, such as 
stocks and real estate. To have a reasonable chance of earning more on 
your investments than it costs you to borrow on your student loans, you must 
be aggressive with your investments. As I discuss in Chapter 3, stocks and real 
estate have produced annual average rates of return of about 9 percent. You 
may be able to earn even more by creating your own small business or by 
investing in others’ businesses.
Keep in mind that you have no guarantee of earning high returns from 
growth-type investments, which can easily drop 20 percent or more in value 
over a year or two.
»
» Paying down your student loans depletes your emergency reserves. 
Psychologically, some people feel uncomfortable paying off debt more quickly 
if it diminishes their savings and investments. You probably don’t want to pay 
down your debt if doing so depletes your financial safety cushion. Make sure 
you have access — through a money market fund or other sources (a family 
member, for example) — to at least three months’ worth of living expenses (as 
I explain in “Establishing an emergency reserve” earlier in this chapter).

54      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
Considering paying down mortgage debt
Paying off your mortgage more quickly is an “investment” for your spare cash 
that may make sense for your financial situation. However, the wisdom of making 
this financial move isn’t as clear as is paying off high-interest consumer debt; 
mortgage interest rates are generally lower, and the interest is typically 
tax-deductible.
As with the decision to pay off a student loan faster (look to the previous section), 
when evaluating whether to pay down your mortgage quicker than necessary, 
compare your mortgage interest rate with your investments’ rates of return. Sup-
pose you have a fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of 5 percent. If you 
decide to make investments instead of paying down your mortgage more quickly, 
your investments need to produce an average annual rate of return, before taxes, 
of more than 5 percent for you to come out ahead financially.
Don’t get hung up on mortgage tax deductions. Although it’s true that mortgage 
interest is usually tax-deductible, you must also pay taxes on investment profits 
generated outside retirement accounts. You can purchase tax-free investments 
like municipal bonds, but over the long haul, such bonds and other types of lend-
ing investments (bank savings accounts, CDs, and other bonds) are unlikely to 
earn a rate of return that’s higher than the cost of your mortgage.
Sorting Out Your Financial Plans
I recommend establishing your financial goals before you begin investing. Other-
wise, you won’t know how much to save or how much risk you need to take or are 
comfortable taking.
You may want to invest money for several goals, or you may have just one pur-
pose. When I was in my 20s, I put some money away toward retirement, but my 
bigger priority at that time was to save money so I could hit the eject button from 
my management consulting job. I knew that I wanted to start my own business 
and that in the early years of my entrepreneurial endeavors, I couldn’t count on 
an income as stable or as large as the one I had in consulting.
I invested these two chunks of money quite differently. I kept the money I saved 
for the start-up of my small business, which was a shorter-term goal, safely 
invested in a money market fund that had a decent yield but didn’t fluctuate in 
value. By contrast, my retirement was a longer-term goal, so I invested the bulk 
of my retirement money in stock funds. If these funds fluctuated and declined in 
value, that was okay in the short term, because I wouldn’t be tapping that money.

CHAPTER 5  Laying Out Your Financial Plans      55
Considering your investment options  
and desires
Many good investing choices exist: You can invest in real estate, the stock market, 
mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or your own business or someone else’s. Or 
you can pay down debts such as on your student loans, credit cards, auto loan, or 
mortgage debt more quickly.
What makes sense for you depends on your goals as well as your personal prefer-
ences. If you detest risk-taking and volatile investments, paying down some 
debts, as recommended earlier in this chapter, may make better sense than invest-
ing in the stock market.
To determine your general investment desires, think about how you would deal 
with an investment that plunges 20 percent, 40 percent, or more in a few years or 
less. Some aggressive investments can fall fast. You shouldn’t go into the stock 
market, real estate, or small-business investment arena if such a drop is likely to 
cause you to sell or make you a miserable wreck. If you haven’t tried riskier invest-
ments yet, you may want to experiment a bit to see how you feel with your money 
invested in them.
A simple way to mask the risk of volatile investments is to diversify your  
portfolio  — that is, put your money into different investments. Not watching 
prices too closely helps, too; that’s one of the reasons why real estate investors are 
less likely to bail out when the market declines. Unfortunately (from my perspec-
tive), stock market investors can get daily and even minute-by-minute price 
updates. Add that fact to the quick phone call, click of your computer mouse, or tap 
on your smartphone that it takes to dump a stock or fund in a flash, and you have 
all the ingredients for shortsighted investing — and potential financial disaster.
Making investing decisions and determining your likes and dislikes is challenging 
when you consider just your own concerns. When you have to consider someone 
else, dealing with these issues becomes doubly hard, given the typically different 
money personalities and emotions that come into play. In most couples with 
whom I’ve worked as a financial counselor, usually one person takes primary 
responsibility for managing the household finances, including investments. In my 
observation, the couples that do the best job with their investments are those who 
communicate well, plan ahead, and compromise.
In my work as a financial counselor, one of the most valuable and difficult things 
I did for couples stuck in unproductive patterns of behavior was help them get the 
issue out on the table. For these couples, the biggest step was making the time to 
discuss their financial management, whether as a couple or working with an advi-
sor or counselor. The key to success is taking the time for each person to explain 

56      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
his or her different point of view and then offer compromises. So be sure to make 
time to discuss your points of view or hire a financial advisor or psychologist/
marriage counselor to help you deal with these issues and differences.
Assessing your savings rate
To accomplish your financial goals, you need to save money, and you also need to 
know your savings rate. Your savings rate is the percentage of your past year’s 
income that you saved and didn’t spend.
Part of being a smart investor involves figuring out how much you need to save to 
reach your goals. Not knowing what you want to do a decade or more from now is 
perfectly normal; after all, your goals, wants, and needs evolve over the years. But 
that doesn’t mean you should just throw your hands in the air and not make an effort 
to see where you stand today and think about where you want to be in the future.
An important benefit of knowing your savings rate is that you can better assess 
how much risk you need to take to accomplish your goals. Seeing the amount that 
you need to save to achieve your dreams may encourage you to take more risk with 
your investments.
During your working years, if you consistently save about 10 percent of your 
annual income, you’re probably saving enough to meet your goals (unless you 
want to retire at a relatively young age). On average, most people need about 
75 percent of their preretirement income throughout retirement to maintain their 
standards of living.
If you’re one of the many people who don’t save enough, do some homework. To 
save more, you need to reduce your spending, increase your income, or both. For 
most people, reducing spending is the more feasible way to save.
To reduce your spending, first figure out where your money goes. You may have 
some general idea, but to make changes, you need to have facts. Examine your 
bill-paying records and review your credit card bills and any other documentation 
that shows your spending history. Tally up how much you spend on dining out, 
operating your car(s), paying your taxes, and everything else. After you have this 
information, you can begin to prioritize and make the necessary trade-offs to 
reduce your spending and increase your savings rate. Earning more income may 
help boost your savings rate as well. Perhaps you can get a higher-paying job or 
increase the number of hours you work. But if you already work a lot, reining in 
your spending is usually better for your emotional and economic well-being.
If you don’t know how to evaluate and reduce your spending or haven’t thought 
about your retirement goals, looked into what you can expect from Social Security, 

CHAPTER 5  Laying Out Your Financial Plans      57
or calculated how much you should save for retirement, now’s the time to do so. 
Pick up my book Personal Finance in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies (Wiley) to find out 
all the necessary details for retirement planning and much more.
Investing regularly with  
dollar cost averaging
Regularly investing money at set time intervals, such as monthly or quarterly, in 
volatile investments such as stocks, stock mutual funds, or exchange-traded 
funds is called dollar cost averaging (DCA). If you’ve ever had money regularly 
deducted from your paycheck and contributed to a retirement savings plan invest-
ment account, you’ve done DCA.
Most folks invest a portion of their employment compensation as they earn it, but 
if you have extra cash sitting around, you can choose to invest that money in one 
fell swoop or to invest it gradually via DCA. The biggest appeal of gradually feed-
ing money into the market via DCA is that you don’t dump all your money into a 
potentially overheated investment just before a major drop. No one has a crystal 
ball and can predict which direction investments will move next in the short term. 
DCA helps shy investors psychologically ease into riskier investments.
DCA is made to order for skittish investors with larger lump sums of money sitting 
in safe investments like CDs or savings accounts. It also makes sense for investors 
with a large chunk of their net worth in cash who want to minimize the risk of 
transferring that cash to riskier investments, such as stocks.
As with any risk-reducing investment strategy, DCA has its drawbacks. If growth 
investments appreciate (as they’re supposed to over time), a DCA investor misses 
out on earning higher returns on his money awaiting investment. Studying U.S. 
stock market data over seven decades, finance professors Richard E. Williams and 
Peter W. Bacon found that approximately two-thirds of the time, a lump-sum 
stock market investor earned higher first-year returns than an investor who fed 
the money in monthly over the first year.
However, knowing that you’ll probably be ahead most of the time if you dump a 
lump sum into the stock market is little solace if you happen to invest just before 
a major drop in prices. For example, from late 2007 to early 2009, global stocks 
shed about half of their value.
If you use DCA too quickly, you may not give the market sufficient time for a cor-
rection to unfold, during and after which some of the DCA purchases may take 
place. If you practice DCA over too long a period of time, you may miss a major 
upswing in stock prices. I suggest using DCA over one to two years to strike a 
balance.

58      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
When you use DCA, establish an automatic investment plan so you’re less likely to 
wimp out of your strategy. Your money that awaits investment in DCA should have 
a suitable parking place. I recommend a money market fund that’s appropriate for 
your tax situation.
Knowing the Impact of Investing  
for College Costs
Many well-intentioned parents want to save for their children’s future educational 
expenses. The mistake that they often make, however, is putting money in accounts 
in the child’s name (in so-called custodial accounts) or saving outside retirement 
accounts in general. The more money you accumulate outside tax-sheltered retire-
ment accounts, the more you will generally end up paying for college costs.
Under the current financial needs analysis used by most colleges and universities 
in awarding “financial aid” (that is, how much of their very high sticker price they 
will charge you), the value of your retirement plan is not considered to be an asset. 
Money that you save outside retirement accounts, including money in the child’s 
name, is counted as an asset and reduces eligibility for financial aid.
Also, be aware that your family’s assets, for purposes of financial aid determina-
tion, generally include equity in real estate and businesses you own. Although the 
federal financial aid analysis no longer counts equity in your primary residence as 
an asset, many private (independent) schools continue to ask parents for this 
information when they make their own financial aid determinations. Thus, paying 
down your home mortgage more quickly instead of funding retirement accounts 
can harm you financially. You may end up paying more for college costs and pay 
more in taxes.
Make it a priority to contribute to your retirement savings plan(s). If you instead 
save money in a nonretirement account for your children’s college expenses, you 
will pay higher taxes both on your current income and on the interest and growth 
of this money. In addition to paying higher taxes, you’ll be expected to pay a 
higher price for your child’s educational expenses.
If you’re sufficiently wealthy that you expect to pay for your children’s full edu-
cational costs without applying for financial aid, you can save some on taxes if you 
invest through custodial accounts. Prior to your child’s reaching age 19, the first 
$2,100 of interest and dividend income is taxed at your child’s income tax rate 

CHAPTER 5  Laying Out Your Financial Plans      59
rather than yours. After age 19 (for full-time students, it’s those under the age of 
24), all income that the investments in your child’s name generate is taxed at your 
child’s rate.
Paying for college
If the way in which the financial aid system works effectively encourages you to 
save in your own retirement accounts, how will you pay for your kid’s education 
expenses? Here are some ideas and resources:
»
» Home equity: You can borrow against your home at a relatively low interest 
rate, and the interest is generally tax-deductible.
»
» Company retirement plans: Some 401(k)s allow borrowing for educational 
costs.
»
» Student loans: Several financial aid programs allow you to borrow at 
reasonable interest rates. The Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and Parent Loans 
for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), for example, are available, even when 
your family isn’t deemed financially needy.
»
» Grants and scholarships: Grant programs are available through schools and 
the government, as well as through independent sources. Complete the Free 
Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application to apply for the federal 
government programs. Grants available through state government programs 
may require a separate application. Specific colleges and other private 
organizations — including employers, banks, credit unions, and community 
groups — also offer grants and scholarships.
»
» Work and save: Your child can work and save money during high school and 
college. In fact, if your child qualifies for financial aid, she’s generally expected 
to contribute a certain amount to education costs from employment (both 
during the school year and summer breaks) and from savings. Besides giving 
your gangly teen a stake in her own future, this training encourages sound 
personal financial management down the road.
Considering educational  
savings account options
You’ll hear about various accounts you can use to invest money for your kid’s 
future college costs. Tread carefully with these, especially because they can affect 
future financial aid.

60      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
The most popular of these accounts are qualified state tuition plans, also known 
as Section 529 plans. These plans offer a tax-advantaged way to save and invest 
more than $100,000 per child toward college costs. (Some states allow upward of 
$300,000 per student.) After you contribute to one of these state-based accounts, 
the invested funds grow without taxation. Withdrawals are also tax-free provided 
the funds are used to pay for qualifying higher-education costs (which include 
PAYING FOR COLLEGE WITHOUT 
BREAKING YOUR BUDGET
One of my favorite financial advice books is Kalman Chany’s Paying For College Without 
Going Broke (Random House). Here are some of his top tips, whether you’re getting your 
first degree or going back to school for another one:
•	 Assume you’re eligible. Don’t rule yourself out because of income or academics, 
and don’t rule out a college because you think it’s too expensive. The higher the 
cost, the more aid you may receive.
•	 Don’t wait to be accepted to a college to apply for aid. The coffers may be 
empty by spring.
•	 Get application forms as soon as possible. You need the federal FAFSA form 
(http://www.fafsa.ed.gov, 800-433-3243). You may also need to complete the 
College Board’s CSS/PROFILE application, state aid forms, and forms provided by 
the colleges you’re interested in attending.
•	 Know the deadlines, and be sure to meet each one. Many colleges have differ-
ent deadlines for different forms. Some may be due in late December, although 
most are due in January through March.
•	 Figure out your expected family contribution. Before you apply, use worksheets 
in financial aid guidebooks to calculate what the colleges will estimate you can 
afford to pay. Be sure to get up-to-date information, as the rules and formulas 
change every year.
•	 Maximize your aid eligibility. Consider also making appropriate adjustments to 
your assets, debts, and retirement provisions before you apply.
•	 Follow instructions carefully on the application forms. Common mistakes that 
can disqualify your applications are forgetting to sign them, leaving lines blank, or 
using the wrong academic year’s version of the forms.
•	 Do your income tax forms early. To meet early aid application deadlines, you may 
need to do a draft version of your most recent year’s income tax return with esti-
mated numbers. Many schools will require a copy of your actual return in the 
spring to verify your information.

CHAPTER 5  Laying Out Your Financial Plans      61
college, graduate school, and certain additional expenses of special-needs stu-
dents). The schools need not be in the same state as the state administering the 
Section 529 plan.
Section 529 plan balances can harm your child’s financial aid chances. Thus, such 
accounts make the most sense for affluent families who are sure they won’t qual-
ify for any type of financial aid. If you do opt for a 529 plan and intend to apply for 
financial aid, you should be the owner of the accounts (not your child) to maxi-
mize qualifying for financial aid.
Investing money earmarked for college
Diversified mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which invest in stocks in 
the United States and internationally, as well as bonds, are ideal vehicles to use 
when you invest money earmarked for college. Be sure to choose funds that fit 
your tax situation if you invest your funds in nonretirement accounts. (See  
Chapter 10 for more information.)
When your child is young (preschool age), consider investing up to 80 percent of 
your investment money in stocks (diversified worldwide) with the remainder in 
bonds. Doing so can maximize the money’s growth potential without taking 
extraordinary risk. As your child makes his way through the later years of elemen-
tary school, you need to begin to make the mix more conservative. Scale back the 
stock percentage to 50 or 60 percent. Finally, in the years just before the child 
enters college, reduce the stock portion to no more than 20 percent or so.
Some 529s offer target-date-type funds that reduce the stock exposure as target 
college dates approach so you don’t have to make the adjustments yourself.
Securing Proper Insurance
As a financial counselor, I’ve seen that although many people lack particular types 
of insurance, others possess unnecessary policies. Many people also keep very low 
deductibles. Remember to insure against potential losses that would be financially 
catastrophic for you; don’t waste your money to protect against smaller losses.
You may be at risk of making a catastrophic investing mistake by not protecting 
your assets properly. Decisions regarding what amount of insurance you need to 
carry are, to some extent, a matter of your desire and ability to accept financial 
risk. But some risks aren’t worth taking. Don’t overestimate your ability to predict 
what accidents and other bad luck may befall you.

62      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
Here’s what insurance I recommend that you have to protect yourself, your loved 
ones, and your assets:
»
» Major medical health insurance: You need a policy that pays for all types of 
major illnesses and major medical expenditures. If your financial situation 
allows, consider taking a health plan with a high deductible, which can 
minimize your premiums. Also consider channeling extra money into a health 
savings account (HSA), which provides tremendous tax breaks. As with a 
retirement account, contributions provide an up-front tax break, and money 
can grow over the years in an HSA without taxation. You can also tap HSA 
funds without penalty or taxation for a wide range of current health expenses.
»
» Adequate liability insurance on your home and car to guard your assets 
against lawsuits: You should have at least enough liability insurance to 
protect your net worth (assets minus your liabilities/debts) or, ideally, twice 
your net worth. If you run your own business, get insurance for your business 
assets if they’re substantial. Also consider professional liability insurance to 
protect against a lawsuit. You may also want to consider incorporating your 
business. (See Chapter 14 for more on small-business issues.)
»
» Long-term disability insurance: Even if you don’t have dependents, odds are 
that you’re dependent on your employment income. What would you (and 
your family) do to replace your income if a major disability prevents you from 
working? Most large employers offer group plans that have good benefits and 
are much less expensive than coverage you’d buy on your own. Also check 
with your professional association for a competitive group plan.
»
» Life insurance, if others are dependent on your income: If you’re single or 
your loved ones can live without your income, skip life insurance. If you need 
coverage, buy term insurance that, like your auto and home insurance, is pure 
insurance protection. The amount of term insurance you need to buy largely 
depends on how much of your income you want to replace.
»
» Estate planning: Most folks need a simple will to delineate to whom they 
would like to leave all their worldly possessions. If you hold significant assets 
outside retirement accounts, you may also benefit from establishing a living 
trust, which keeps your money from filtering through the hands of probate 
lawyers. Living wills and medical powers of attorney are useful to have in case 
you’re ever in a medically incapacitated situation. If you have substantial 
assets, doing more involved estate planning is wise to minimize estate taxes 
and ensure the orderly passing of your assets to your heirs.
For all the details on the best and most effective ways to buy insurance, what to 
look for in policies, and where to get good policies, see my book Personal Finance in 
Your 20s & 30s For Dummies (Wiley), and visit my website at www.erictyson.com.

ustomer visits to stand-alone bank branches with a lobby and tellers are 
going the way of the big-city newspaper business. Both are in decline and 
in industries that are being revolutionized and changed by the Internet.
Who needs retail banks, with their costly-to-maintain branches, when you can do 
your banking online? You can conduct most transactions quicker online, and it 
saves the bank money, which enables it to offer you better account terms. And 
there’s no need to rush out at lunchtime to be sure you make it to your bank dur-
ing its limited open hours. Online banking is generally available 24/7.
But I have even bigger questions for you to consider: Do you even need a bank 
account? What are your best alternatives? That’s what this chapter explores.
Everyone needs an account or two from which to conduct transactions, including 
paying bills and storing newly earned money. Such foundational accounts are 
essential to get in order before proceeding with investing that has the potential to 
produce higher returns.

64      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
Understanding FDIC Bank Insurance
What makes keeping your money in a U.S. bank unique is the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance that protects bank deposits. If your bank 
fails (and as history shows, some banks do fail), and if your bank participates in 
the FDIC system, your bank account is insured by the U.S. government up to 
$250,000. The stamp of FDIC backing and insurance is soothing to some (primarily 
older) folks who worry about all the risks and dangers in the investment world.
While the FDIC insurance is worth something, banks have to pay for this protec-
tion. That cost is effectively passed along to you in the form of lower interest rates 
on your deposits.
Just because the federal government stands behind the banking FDIC system 
doesn’t mean your money is 100 percent safe in the event of a bank failure. 
Although you’re insured for $250,000 in a bank, if the bank fails, you may wait 
quite a while to get your money back — and you may get less interest than you 
thought you would. Banks fail and will continue to fail. During the 1980s and early 
1990s, and again in the late 2000s, hundreds of insured banks and savings and 
loans failed. (Between the early 1990s and mid-2000s  — a relatively strong 
­economic period — only a handful of banks failed annually.)
Any investment that involves lending your money to someone else or to some 
organization, including putting your money in a bank or buying a Treasury bond 
that the federal government issues, carries risk. Although I’m not a doomsayer, 
any student of history knows that governments and civilizations fail.
FDIC backing is hardly a unique protection. Every Treasury bond is issued and 
backed by the federal government, the same debt-laden organization that stands 
behind the FDIC. Plenty of other nearly equivalent safe lending investments yield 
higher returns than bank accounts. Highly rated corporate bonds are good exam-
ples (see Chapter 9). That’s not to say that you shouldn’t consider keeping some 
of your money in a bank. But first, you should be aware of the realities and costs 
of FDIC insurance.
Investing in Banking Account  
and Savings Vehicles
While traditional banks with walk-in branch locations are shrinking in number 
due to closures, bank mergers, and failures, online banks are growing — and for 
good reason. Some of the biggest expenses of operating a traditional retail bank 

CHAPTER 6  Starting Out with Bank and Credit Union Accounts      65
are the cost of the real estate and the related costs of the branch. An online bank 
eliminates much of those costs; thus, these banks are able, for example, to pay 
their customers higher interest rates on their account balances. And online banks 
can offer better terms on checking accounts and loans.
The Internet is lowering costs for many industries, and the banking industry is 
one of those. This doesn’t mean, however, that you should rush to become a cus-
tomer of an online bank, because other financial companies, like mutual funds 
and brokerage firms, offer attractive investment accounts and options as well. 
(See the section “Exploring Alternatives to Bank Accounts” later in this chapter.)
Bank checking accounts and debit cards
Whether it’s paying monthly bills or having something in your wallet to make 
purchases with at restaurants and retail stores, we all need the ability to conduct 
transactions and access our money. I’m not a fan of credit cards, because the 
credit feature enables you to spend money you don’t have and carry a debt balance 
month to month. Notwithstanding the lower short-term interest rates some cards 
charge to lure new customers, the reality is that borrowing on credit cards is 
expensive — usually, to the tune of more than 18 percent for most young adults.
Paying a credit card bill in full each month is the smart way to use such a card and 
avoid these high interest charges. But about half of all credit card holders use the 
high-interest-rate credit feature on their cards.
Debit cards are excellent transaction vehicles and a better alternative for folks 
who are prone to borrow via their credit cards. A debit card connects to your 
checking account, thus eliminating the need for you to carry around excess cash. 
And as with a credit card, you can dispute transactions if the product or service 
isn’t what the seller claimed it would be and fails to stand behind it. But unlike a 
credit card, a debit card has no credit feature, so you can’t spend money you don’t 
have. (Some checking accounts offer prearranged lines of credit for overdrafts.)
During periods of relatively low interest rates like those of the last several years, 
the fees levied on a transaction account, like a checking account, should be of 
greater concern to you than the interest paid on account balances. After all, you 
shouldn’t be keeping lots of extra cash in a checking account; you’ve got better 
options for that, which I discuss in the rest of this chapter.
One reason why bank customers have gotten worse terms on their accounts is that 
they gravitate toward larger banks and their extensive ATM networks so they can 
easily get cash when they need it. These ATM networks (and the often-associated 
bank branches) are costly for banks to maintain. So you pay higher fees and get 

66      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
lower yields when you’re the customer of a bank with a large ATM network, espe-
cially a bank that does tons of advertising.
By using a debit card that carries a VISA or MasterCard logo, you won’t need to 
access and carry around much cash. Debit cards are widely accepted by merchants 
and are connected to your checking account. These cards can be used for pur-
chases and for obtaining cash from your checking account.
Savings accounts and certificates of deposit
Banks generally pay higher interest rates on savings account balances than they 
do on checking account balances. But they have often lagged behind the best 
money market funds, offered by mutual fund companies and brokerage firms (see 
Chapter 7). Online banking is changing that dynamic, however, and now the best 
banks offer competitive rates on savings accounts.
The virtue of most savings accounts is that you can earn some interest yet have 
penalty-free access to your money. The investment won’t fluctuate in value the 
way that a bond will, and you don’t have early-withdrawal penalties, as you do 
with a certificate of deposit (CD).
The yield on bank savings accounts is generally pretty crummy. That’s why your 
friendly neighborhood banker will be quick to suggest a CD as a higher-yielding 
investment alternative to a bank savings account. He or she may tout the fact that 
unlike a bond (discussed in Chapter 9), a CD doesn’t have fluctuating principal 
value. CDs also give you the peace of mind afforded by the government’s FDIC 
insurance program.
CDs pay higher interest rates than savings accounts because you commit to tie up 
your money for a period of time, such as 6 or 12 months, or 3 or 5 years. The bank 
pays you, say, 2 percent and then turns around and lends your money to others 
through credit cards, auto loans, and so on. The bank charges those borrowers an 
interest rate of 10 percent or more. Not a bad business!
I’m generally not a fan of CDs. I’ve found that some investors (typically older ones 
who are worried about risk) use CDs by default without researching their pros and 
cons. Here are some drawbacks that your banker may neglect to mention:
»
» Early-withdrawal penalties: When you tie up your money in a CD and later 
decide you want it back before the CD matures, a hefty penalty (typically, 
about six months’ interest) is usually shaved from your return. With other 
lending investments, such as bonds and bond mutual funds, you can access 
your money without penalty and generally at little or no cost.

CHAPTER 6  Starting Out with Bank and Credit Union Accounts      67
»
» Mediocre yields: In addition to carrying penalties for early withdrawal, a CD 
yields less than a high-quality bond with a comparable maturity (such as two, 
five, or ten years). Often, the yield difference is 1 percent or more, especially if 
you don’t shop around and simply buy CDs from the local bank where you 
keep your checking account.
»
» Only one tax flavor: High-tax-bracket investors who purchase CDs outside 
their retirement accounts should be aware of a final and perhaps fatal flaw of 
CDs: The interest on CDs is fully taxable at the federal and state levels. Bonds, 
by contrast, are available in tax-free (federal and/or state) versions, if you 
desire.
You can earn higher returns and have better access to your money when it’s in 
bonds and bond funds than you can when it’s in CDs. Bonds make especially good 
sense when you’re in a higher tax bracket and would benefit from tax-free income 
in a nonretirement account. CDs may make sense when you know, for example, 
that you can invest your money for, say, two years, after which time you need the 
money for some purchase that you expect to make. Just make sure you shop 
around to get the best interest rate from an FDIC-insured bank. If having that U.S. 
government insurance gives you peace of mind, consider investing in Treasury 
bonds, which tend to pay more interest than many CDs (see Chapter 9).
Negotiating with Bankers
Especially at traditional bricks-and-mortar banks in your local community, you 
may be able to get better terms and deals if you ask. Let me give you a common 
example.
Suppose that for several years, you’ve had a checking account at your local bank 
and have not had any real issues or problems. Then one month, you end up bounc-
ing several check payments (say, four at $30 each) because a deposit into your 
account didn’t clear in time. You may very well be able to get some or even all of 
these fees waived by pleading your case to the local branch manager. Explain how 
long you’ve been a good customer and why this was a one-time case of bad luck, 
something beyond your control, and so on. The worst that can happen is that the 
manager will turn down your request, and you’ll have wasted a few minutes of 
your day. More likely, however, is that you might save yourself $90 to $120 for a 
small amount of your time.
Deposit account terms and loan terms are harder to negotiate, but I’ve seen folks 
have some success even in those arenas. Your regular bank may offer better mort-
gage terms if it knows it needs to match or beat a more competitive offer from 
another bank you’ve shopped, for example.

68      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
Feeling Secure with Your Bank
Putting your money in a bank may make you feel safe for a variety of reasons. For 
your parents and your grandparents, the first investing experience was likely at 
the neighborhood bank where they established checking and savings accounts.
Part of your comfort in keeping your money in a bank may stem from the fact that 
the bank is where your well-intentioned mom and dad may have first steered you 
financially. Also, at a local branch, often within a short distance of your home or 
office, you find vaults and security-monitoring cameras to protect your deposits.
Bank branches cost a lot of money to operate. Guess where that money comes 
from? From bank depositors and the customers of the banks’ various services, of 
course! These operating costs are one of the reasons why the interest rates that 
banks pay often pale in comparison to some of the similarly secure alternatives 
discussed elsewhere in this book (such as in Chapter 7, where I discuss money 
market funds in detail as alternatives to bank savings accounts). This also explains 
why an online bank may be your best choice if you want to keep some of your 
money in a bank.
Evaluating any bank
Most folks know to look for a bank that participates in the U.S.-government-
operated FDIC program. Otherwise, if the bank fails, your money on deposit isn’t 
protected. FDIC covers your deposits up to a cool $250,000.
Some online banks are able to offer higher interest rates because they are based 
overseas and, therefore, are not participating in the FDIC program. (Banks must 
pay insurance premiums into the FDIC fund, which adds, of course, to a bank’s 
costs.) Another risk for you is that noncovered banks may take excessive risks 
with their business to be able to pay depositors higher interest rates.
When considering doing business with an online bank or a smaller bank you’ve 
not heard of, you should be especially careful to ensure that the bank is covered 
under FDIC. Don’t simply accept the bank’s word for it or the display of the FDIC 
logo in its offices or on its website.
Check the FDIC’s website database of FDIC-insured institutions to see whether 
the bank you’re considering doing business with is covered. Search by going to the 
FDIC’s Bank Find page (https://research.fdic.gov/bankfind/). You can 
search by the name, city, state, or zip code of the bank. For insured banks, you can 
see the date when it became insured, its insurance certificate number, the main 

CHAPTER 6  Starting Out with Bank and Credit Union Accounts      69
office location for the bank (and branches), its primary government regulator, and 
other links to detailed information about the bank. In the event that your bank 
doesn’t appear on the FDIC list, yet the bank claims FDIC coverage, contact the 
FDIC at (877) 275-3342.
In addition to ensuring that a bank is covered by the FDIC, investigate the 
following:
»
» What is the bank’s reputation for its services? This may not be easy to 
discern, but at a minimum, you should conduct an Internet search of the bank’s 
name along with the words complaints or problems and examine the results.
»
» How accessible are customer-service people at the bank? Is a phone 
number provided on the bank’s website? How hard is it to reach a live person, 
the local branch, and its personnel (including the manager)? Are the customer-
service representatives you reach knowledgeable and service-oriented?
»
» What are the process and options for getting your money out? This issue 
is a good one to discuss with the bank’s customer-service people.
»
» What fees are charged for particular services? This information should be 
posted on the bank’s website in a section called something like Accounts 
Terms or Disclosures. Also, request and inspect the bank’s Truth in Savings 
Disclosure, which answers relevant account questions in a standardized 
format. Figure 6-1 is an example of an online bank’s disclosure for savings 
accounts.
Protecting yourself when  
banking online
The attractions of banking online are pretty obvious. For starters, it can be enor-
mously convenient, as you bank when you want on your computer. You don’t have 
to race around during your lunch break to find a local bank branch. And thanks to 
their lower overhead, the best online banks are able to offer competitive interest 
rates and account terms to their customers.
You probably know from experience that conducting any type of transaction 
online is safe as long as you use some common sense and know who you’re doing 
business with before you go forward. That said, others who’ve gone before you 
have gotten ripped off, and you do need to protect yourself.

70      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
Take the following steps to protect yourself and your identity when conducting 
business online:
»
» Never access your bank accounts from a shared computer or on a shared 
network, such as the free access networks offered in hotel rooms and in other 
public or business facilities.

»
» Make certain that your computer has antivirus and firewall software that is 
updated periodically to keep up with the latest threats.
»
» Be aware of missed statements, which could indicate that your account has 
been taken over.
»
» Report unauthorized transactions to your bank or credit card company as 
soon as possible; otherwise, your bank may not stand behind the loss of 
funds.
»
» Use a complicated and unique password (including letters and numbers) for 
your online bank account.
»
» Log out immediately after completing your transactions on financial websites.
Exploring Alternatives to Bank Accounts
If you’ve been with me since the beginning of this chapter, you know that the best 
banks that are focused online should have a cost advantage over their peers that 
have branch locations. Well, there are other financial companies that have similar, 
and in some cases even better, cost advantages (which translates into better deals 
for you): credit unions, discount and online brokerage firms, and mutual fund 
companies.
Credit union accounts and benefits
Credit unions are unique creatures (I guess I should say a unique species) within 
the financial-services-firm universe. Credit unions are similar to banks in the 
products and services that they offer (although private banks tend to offer a deeper 
array). However, unlike banks, which are run as private businesses seeking prof-
its, credit unions operate as nonprofit entities and are technically owned by their 
members (customers). If they’re efficiently operated, the best credit unions offer 
their customers better terms on deposits, including checking and savings accounts 
(higher interest rates and lower fees) and some loans (lower rates and fees).
Don’t assume that credit unions necessarily or always offer better products and 
services than traditional banks, because they don’t. The profit motive of private 
businesses isn’t evil; quite to the contrary, the profit motive spurs businesses to 
keep getting better at and improving on what they do.

72      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
Credit unions have insurance coverage up to $250,000 per customer through the 
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), similar to the FDIC protection that 
banks offer their customers. As when checking out a bank, be sure that any credit 
union you may deposit money into has NCUA insurance coverage.
The trick to getting access to a credit union is that by law, each individual credit 
union may offer its services only to a defined membership. Examples of the types 
of credit union memberships available include
»
» Alumni
»
» College and university
»
» Community
»
» Employer
»
» Place of worship
There can be some overlap between these groups. To access a credit union, you 
also may be able to use your family ties.
To find credit unions in your local area, visit the Credit Union National Association 
consumer’s website at www.asmarterchoice.org/.
Brokerage accounts
A type of account worth checking out at brokerage firms is generally known as an 
asset management account. When these types of accounts first came into exis-
tence decades ago, they really were only for affluent investors. That is no longer 
the case, although the best deals on such accounts at some firms are available to 
higher-balance investors.
Brokerage firms enable you to buy and sell stocks, bonds, and other securities. 
Among the larger brokerage firms or investment companies with substantial bro-
kerage operations you may have read or heard about are Charles Schwab, ETrade, 
Fidelity, ScottTrade, T.D. Ameritrade, and Vanguard.
Now, some of these firms have fairly extensive branch office networks, and others 
don’t. But those that have a reasonable number of branch offices have been able 
to keep a competitive position because of their extensive customer and asset base 
and because they aren’t burdened by banking regulations (they aren’t banks) and 
the costs associated with operating as a bank.

CHAPTER 6  Starting Out with Bank and Credit Union Accounts      73
The best of brokerage firm asset management accounts typically enable you to
»
» Invest in various investments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and 
exchange-traded funds, and hold those investments in a single account.
»
» Write checks against a money market balance that pays competitive yields.
»
» Use a VISA or MasterCard debit card for transactions.
Money market mutual funds
Because bank savings accounts historically have paid pretty crummy interest 
rates, you need to think long and hard about keeping your spare cash in the bank. 
Instead of relying on the bank, try keeping your extra savings in a money market 
fund, which is a type of mutual fund. (Other funds focus on bonds or stocks.) 
Money market funds historically have offered a higher-yielding alternative to 
bank savings and bank money market deposit accounts. I use a money market 
fund that offers unlimited check writing at a mutual fund company. I also don’t 
keep my extra savings in the bank.
The mutual fund business is huge; fund companies hold assets totaling in excess 
of $17 trillion. A significant chunk of that — nearly $3 trillion — is held in money 
market mutual funds.
A money market fund is similar to a bank savings account except that it is offered 
by a mutual fund company and therefore lacks FDIC coverage. Historically, this 
hasn’t been a problem, as retail money market funds have never lost shareholder 
principal for retail investors.
A money market fund is similar to a bank savings account except that it is offered 
by a mutual fund company and therefore lacks FDIC coverage. Historically, this 
hasn’t been a problem because retail money market funds have lost shareholder 
principal in only one case for retail investors (the Reserve Primary fund lost less 
than 1 percent of assets during the 2008 financial crisis).
The attraction of money market funds has been that the best ones pay higher 
yields than bank savings accounts and also come in tax-free versions, which is 
good for higher-tax-bracket investors. I explain money market funds in greater 
detail in Chapter 7.

Managing Money 
Market Funds
F
or many years, folks kept their spare cash in a local bank, and for good rea-
son. The local bank was convenient, offered safety and peace of mind with 
the government backing for money on deposit, and generally paid some 
interest on the money.
In the 1970s, however, the investment landscape changed for smaller investors. 
Interest rates and inflation increased, yet banks were limited by regulations in  
the interest rates they could pay depositors. Thus was born the money market fund.
In this chapter, I discuss the risks and rewards of money funds, uses for funds, 
and how to pick the best ones to help you meet your investing goals.
Defining Money Market Mutual Funds
Money market mutual funds began in 1971. They invested in the higher-yielding 
financial instruments that were accessible only to larger institutional investors 
with large sums to invest. Money market funds “democratized” these invest-
ments by selling shares to investors with relatively small amounts to invest. 

76      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
By pooling the money of thousands of investors, and after charging a reasonable 
fee to cover their operational expenses and make a profit, money market funds 
were able to offer investors a better yield than typical bank accounts.
Money market funds are unique among mutual fund company offerings because 
they don’t fluctuate in value and maintain a fixed $1-per-share price. (An excep-
tion: During the 2008 financial crisis, the Reserve Primary fund had a small 
­portion of its investments go bad, and some shareholders lost just under 1 percent 
of their invested principal.) As with a bank savings account, your principal invest-
ment in a money market fund doesn’t change in value.
With a money market fund, your investment earns dividends. Dividends are much 
like the interest you receive from a bank savings account.
Making sense of the appeal  
of money market funds
The best money market mutual funds offer the following benefits over bank 
­savings accounts:
»
» Higher yields: Money market mutual funds generally yield more because 
they don’t have the higher costs that banks do from having branch offices all 
over. Banks can get away with paying lower yields because they know that 
many depositors believe that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC) insurance that comes with a bank savings account makes it safer than a 
money market mutual fund. (For more on the safety of money funds com-
pared with banks, see the next section, “Understanding the drawback of 
money market funds”). Also, the FDIC insurance is an expense that banks 
ultimately pass on to their customers. (See Chapter 6 for more on banks and 
banking options.)
»
» Tax-free flavors: If you’re in a high tax bracket, tax-free money market funds 
offer you something that bank accounts don’t. Bank accounts only pay interest 
that is fully taxable at both the federal and state levels. Money market funds 
can be state and federal tax-free (for folks in high tax brackets), just federal 
tax-free (for folks in a high federal tax bracket), or fully taxable.
»
» Check writing: Another useful feature of money market mutual funds is the 
ability they provide you to write checks, free of charge, against your account. 
Most mutual fund companies require that the checks that you write be for 
larger amounts — typically $250 minimum. Some brokerage cash manage-
ment accounts that include money funds (at firms like Charles Schwab, 

CHAPTER 7  Managing Money Market Funds      77
Fidelity, T.D. Ameritrade, and Vanguard) allow you to write checks for any 
amount. With these types of money market fund accounts, you can ditch your 
bank completely because such accounts often come with debit cards that you 
can use at bank ATMs for a nominal fee. (Some brokerage firms levy service 
fees if you don’t have enough assets with them or don’t have regular monthly 
electronic transfers, such as direct deposit of your paycheck.)
Understanding the drawback  
of money market funds
The best money market mutual funds have higher yields, tax-free alternatives, 
and check writing — features not offered by bank savings accounts. But you need 
to know about one difference between bank accounts and money market mutual 
funds: Money funds aren’t insured (except for a one-year period during the 
2008–2009 financial crisis).
Bank accounts come with FDIC insurance that protects your deposited money up 
to $250,000 (see Chapter 6). So if a bank fails because it lends too much money to 
people and companies that go bankrupt or abscond with the funds, you should get 
your money back from the FDIC.
The lack of FDIC insurance on a money fund shouldn’t trouble you, however. 
Mutual fund companies can’t fail because they have a dollar invested in securities 
for every dollar that you deposit in their money funds. By contrast, banks are 
required to have available just a portion — about 10 cents for every dollar that you 
hand over to them.
Cases have occurred in which money market funds bought some investments that 
declined in value. However, in all but one case involving funds taking in money 
from retail investors like you and me, the money funds kept their $1-per-share 
price.
If you’re concerned about the lack of FDIC insurance on a money market fund, 
stick with money market funds from the bigger mutual fund companies. They 
have the financial wherewithal and the biggest incentive to save a foundering 
money fund. Fortunately, the bigger fund companies typically have the best 
money funds anyway.

78      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
Understanding Money Market  
Fund Holdings
Money market funds are a safe, higher-yielding alternative to bank accounts. 
Under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, money market funds can 
invest only in the highest-credit-rated securities, and their investments must 
have an average maturity of less than 60 days. The short-term nature of these 
securities effectively eliminates the risk of money market funds being sensitive to 
changes in interest rates (a concern with bonds, which are covered in Chapter 9).
The securities that money market funds buy and hold are extremely safe. General-
purpose money market funds invest in government-backed securities, bank cer-
tificates of deposit, and short-term corporate debt that the largest and most 
creditworthy companies and the U.S. government issue.
You may not know (or care) what these holdings are. However, here’s a short 
explanation of the most common money fund holdings to aid your understanding 
and comfort level:
»
» Commercial paper: Larger corporations often need to borrow money to help 
make their businesses grow and prosper. In the past, most companies needing 
a short-term loan had to borrow money from a bank. In recent decades, issuing 
short-term debt known as commercial paper directly to interested investors has 
become easier. Money market funds buy high-quality commercial paper issued 
by large companies, banks, and foreign governments.
»
» Certificates of deposit: When you put your money in a certificate of deposit 
(CD) at your local bank, what you’re doing is making a specific-term loan  
(3 months, 6 months, 2 years) to your bank. Money market funds can buy CDs 
as well. When they do, however, they usually invest millions of dollars in bank 
CDs. Thus, they can command a higher interest rate than you can get on your 
own. Money funds buy CDs that mature within a couple of months. The 
money fund is insured only up to $250,000 per bank CD (so they may use 
multiple banks), just like the bank insurance that customers receive. As with 
other money fund investments, the money fund does research to determine 
the credit quality of banks and other institutions that it invests in. Remember 
that money funds’ other investments aren’t insured.
»
» Government debt: The U.S. federal government has trillions of dollars in 
debt outstanding in the form of Treasury securities. In addition to investing 
in Treasuries soon to mature, money funds invest in short-term debt issued 
by government-affiliated agencies. Some money market funds specialize in 
certain types of government securities that distribute tax-free income to their 

CHAPTER 7  Managing Money Market Funds      79
investors. Treasury money market funds, for example, buy Treasuries and pay 
dividends that are state-tax-free but federally taxable. State-specific municipal 
money market funds invest in debt issued by state and local governments in 
one state. The dividends on state money funds are federal-tax-free and 
state-tax-free, if you’re a resident of that state.
Protecting and Accessing Your  
Money in Money Funds
A potentially big psychological impediment to some folks using money funds is 
that they must deal with money funds online, by phone, and through the mail. 
That creates some worries, like one of your checks getting lost or stolen and how 
accessible your money is, but protecting and accessing your money isn’t as chal-
lenging as it may seem.
Protecting your money
Checks received and sent from a money market fund are just as safe as those 
received and sent from any other type of account. No one can legally cash a check 
made payable to you. Don’t mistakenly think that going to your local bank in 
­person is safer. Bank robberies happen all the time, totaling in the thousands 
annually.
Increasing numbers of money market funds offer mobile apps that enable you to 
take a picture of and deposit checks with your smartphone, all from the comfort 
of your home or wherever you happen to be. If your fund company doesn’t offer a 
mobile check deposit app and you’re really concerned about sending a check in the 
mail, use a fund company or discount broker with branch offices reasonably close 
to your home or office. I don’t recommend spending the extra money and time 
required to send your check by way of registered or certified mail. You know if 
your check got there when you get the transaction entry from the fund company 
processing the deposit.
In those rare cases where a check does get lost, remember that checks can be reis-
sued. And when you’re depositing a check made payable to you, be sure to endorse 
the check with the notation “For deposit only” along with your account number 
under your signature.

80      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
Accessing your money
With most money market mutual funds, you will likely be sending your money to 
a company out of state, so it may seem to you that you won’t be able to access 
these funds efficiently if you need to. However, you can efficiently tap your money 
market fund in a variety of ways. You can use the following methods at most fund 
companies:
»
» Check writing: The simplest way to access your money market fund is to 
write a check. Suppose you have an unexpectedly large expense that you can’t 
afford to pay out of your bank checking account. Just write a check on your 
money market mutual fund.
»
» Electronic transfers: Another handy way to access your money is to call the 
fund company and ask to have money sent electronically from your money 
market fund to your bank account, or vice versa. Such transactions can also 
usually be done on fund companies’ websites and typically take one business 
day to complete. Or you can have the fund company mail you a check for your 
desired amount from your money fund (although that obviously isn’t a “quick” 
way to get needed money). If you need money regularly sent from your money 
market fund to, say, your local bank checking account, you can set up an 
automatic withdrawal plan. On a designated day of the month, your money 
market fund electronically sends money to your checking account.
»
» Debit cards: Brokerage account money funds that offer debit cards allow 
access to your money through bank ATMs. Just find out first what fees you 
may have to pay for using particular ATM networks.
»
» Wiring: If you need cash in a flash (for example, same day), many money 
market funds offer the option of wiring money to and from your bank. Both 
the money market fund and the bank usually assess a small charge for this 
service. Most companies can also send you money via an overnight express 
carrier, although you’ll likely have to foot that bill.
Unlike when you visit a bank, you can’t simply drop by the branch office of a 
mutual fund company (even if it happens to be nearby) and withdraw funds from 
your account. Money market fund companies don’t keep money in branch offices 
because they’re not banks. However, you can establish the preceding account fea-
tures, if you didn’t set them up when you originally set up your account, by mail-
ing in a form or by visiting the fund’s branch office. Alternatively, you may be able 
to add these services to your account through the fund company’s website.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Money Market Funds      81
Using Money Market Funds 
in Your Investment Plan
The best money market funds enable you to substitute for a bank savings account 
while offering comparable safety to a bank, but with a better yield. Money market 
funds are well suited for some of the following purposes:
»
» Rainy-day/emergency reserve: Because you don’t know what the future 
holds, you’re wise to prepare for the unexpected, such as job loss, the desire 
to take some extra time when changing jobs, unexpected health care bills, or 
a leaky roof on your home. Three to six months’ worth of living expenses is a 
good emergency reserve target for most people. (If you spend $2,500 in an 
average month, for example, keep $7,500 to $15,000 in reserve.) Three 
months’ living expenses may do if you have other accounts, such as a 401(k), 
or family that you could tap for a loan. Keep up to one year’s expenses if your 
income fluctuates greatly. If your profession involves a high risk of job loss, 
and if finding another job could take a long time, you also need a significant 
cash safety net.
»
» Short-term savings goals: If you’re saving money for a big-ticket item that 
you hope to purchase within the next couple of years — whether it’s an HDTV, 
a car, or a down payment on a home — a money market fund is a sensible 
place to save the money. With a short time horizon, you can’t afford to expose 
your money to the gyrations of stocks or longer-term bonds. A money market 
fund offers a safe haven for your principal and some positive return.
»
» A parking spot for money awaiting investment: Suppose you have a chunk 
of money that you want to invest for longer-term purposes, but you don’t 
want to invest it all at once, for fear that you may buy into stocks and bonds 
just before a big drop. A money market fund can be a friendly home to the 
money awaiting investment as you gradually move it into your chosen 
investment. (I explain this technique, known as dollar cost averaging, in 
Chapter 5.)
»
» Personal checking accounts: You can use money market funds with no 
restrictions on check writing for household checking purposes. Some discount 
brokerage services that offer accounts with a check-writing option downplay 
the fact that an investor is allowed to write an unlimited number of checks in 
any amounts on his or her account. You can leave your bank altogether; some 
money funds even come with debit cards that you can use at bank ATMs for a 
nominal fee.

82      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
»
» Business accounts: You can also open a money market fund for your 
business. You can use this account for depositing checks received from 
customers and holding excess funds, as well as for paying bills by means of 
the check-writing feature. Some money funds allow checks to be written for 
any amount, and such accounts can completely replace a bank checking 
account.
Shopping for the Best Money Funds
If you’re interested in putting some of your money into a money market mutual 
fund, in this section, I name names. Before getting to that, however, allow me to 
explain what I look for when selecting a money market fund.
Understanding traits of leading  
money funds
When looking for an outstanding money market fund, look for these attributes:
»
» Low expenses: Select a money market fund that does a good job of control-
ling its expenses. The operating expenses that the fund deducts before 
payment of dividends are the biggest determinant of yield. All other things 
being equal (which they usually are with different money market funds), lower 
operating expenses translate into higher yields for you. Within a given 
category of money market funds (general, Treasury, municipal, and so on), 
fund managers invest in the same basic securities. The market for these 
securities is pretty darn efficient, so “superstar” money market fund managers 
may eke out an extra 0.1 percent per year in yield, but not much more. Lower 
expenses don’t mean that a fund company cuts corners or provides poor 
service. By attracting more money to manage, efficiently managed larger 
funds are able to manage money for a lower expense percentage.
»
» Tax appropriate for your situation: With money market funds, all your 
return comes from dividends. What you actually get to keep of these returns 
is what’s left over after the federal and state governments take their cut of 
your investment income. If you invest money that’s held outside a retirement 
account, and you’re in a high tax bracket, you may come out ahead if you 
invest in tax-free money market funds. (Tax-free refers to the taxability of the 
dividends that the fund pays. You don’t get a tax deduction for money that 
you put into the fund, as you do with certain retirement accounts.) If you’re in 
a high-tax state, a state money market fund — if a good one exists for your 
state — may be a sound move.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Money Market Funds      83
»
» Other attractive fund offerings: Consider what other investing you plan to 
do at the fund company where you establish a money market fund. Suppose 
you decide to make mutual fund investments in stocks and bonds at a specific 
fund company. In that case, keeping a money market fund at a different firm 
that offers a slightly higher yield may not be worth the time and administra-
tive hassle, especially if you don’t plan on holding much cash in your money 
market fund.
»
» Associated services: Good money market funds offer other useful services 
included with their accounts, such as check writing, telephone exchange and 
redemptions, and automated electronic exchange services with your bank 
account.
Most mutual fund companies don’t have many local branch offices. Generally, this 
fact helps fund companies keep their expenses low so they can pay you greater 
money market fund yields.
You may open and maintain your mutual fund account via the fund’s company’s 
website, toll-free phone lines, or the company’s website. You don’t really get 
much benefit from selecting a fund company with an office in your area (although 
you may feel some peace of mind).
Naming good money funds
Using the criteria in the preceding section, in this section, I recommend good 
money market funds — that is, those that offer competitive yields, check writing, 
access to other excellent mutual funds, and other commonly needed money mar-
ket services.
Money market funds that pay taxable dividends may be appropriate for retirement 
account funds that await investment as well as non-retirement-account money 
when you’re not in a high federal tax bracket and aren’t in a high state tax bracket 
(less than 5 percent).
Here are the best taxable money market funds to consider:
»
» Fidelity Cash Reserves
»
» T. Rowe Price Summit Cash Reserves (higher yields if you invest $25,000)
»
» Vanguard’s Prime Money Market
Consider U.S. Treasury money market funds if you prefer a money market fund 
that invests in U.S. Treasuries, which maintain the safety of government backing, 

84      PART 2  Preparing Your Investing Foundation
or if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but are in a high state tax bracket  
(5 percent or higher).
Here are the U.S. Treasury funds that I recommend:
»
» Fidelity’s Government Money Market
»
» USAA’s Treasury Money Market
»
» Vanguard Treasury Money Market
Municipal (also known as muni) money market funds invest in short-term debt 
that state and local governments issue. A municipal money market fund, which 
pays you federally tax-free dividends, invests in munis issued by state and local 
governments throughout the country.
A state-specific municipal fund invests in state and local government-issued 
munis for one state, such as New  York. So if you live in New  York and buy a 
New York municipal fund, the dividends on that fund are federal and New York 
state tax-free.
So how do you decide whether to buy a nationwide or state-specific municipal 
money market fund? Federal tax-free-only money market funds may be appro-
priate when you’re in a high federal tax bracket but not in a high state bracket 
(less than 5 percent). State tax-free municipal money market funds are worth 
considering when you’re in a high federal and a high state tax bracket (5 percent 
or higher).
If you’re in a higher state tax bracket, your state may not have good (or any) state 
tax-free municipal money market funds available. If you live in any of those 
states, you’re likely best off with one of the following national municipal money 
market funds:
»
» T. Rowe Price Summit Municipal Money Market ($25,000 minimum)
»
» USAA Tax-Exempt Money Market
»
» Vanguard Tax-Exempt Money Market
Fidelity, USAA, and Vanguard have good funds for several states. If you can’t find 
a good state-specific fund for your state, or you’re in a high federal tax bracket 
only, use one of these nationwide muni money markets.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Money Market Funds      85
Alternatives to Money Market  
Mutual Funds
Banks developed an account that is similar to a money market mutual fund, which 
they typically call a money market deposit account (MMDA). Banks set the inter-
est rate on MMDAs, and historically, those rates have been a bit lower than what 
you can get from one of the better money market mutual funds (although this has 
been less true during the extended period of low interest rates during the 2010s). 
Check writing on MMDAs, if it’s available, may be restricted to a few checks 
monthly.
As latecomers to the mutual fund business, some banks now offer real money 
market mutual funds, including tax-free money funds. Again, the better money 
market mutual funds from mutual fund companies are generally superior to those 
offered by banks. The reason: Most bank money market funds have higher operat-
ing expenses and, hence, lower yields than the best money funds offered by 
mutual fund companies.
Although I advocate use of the best money market funds, I realize that a bank or 
credit union savings account is sometimes the most practical place to keep your 
money. Your local bank, for example, may appeal to you if you like being able to 
conduct business face to face. Perhaps you operate a business where some cash is 
processed; in this case, you probably can’t beat the convenience and other services 
that a local bank offers.
If you have only $1,000 or $2,000 to invest, a bank savings account may be your 
better option; the best money market funds generally require a higher minimum 
initial investment.
For investing short-term excess cash, you may first want to consider keeping it in 
your checking account. This option may make financial sense if the extra money 
helps you avoid monthly service charges because your balance occasionally dips 
below the minimum. In fact, keeping money in a separate savings account rather 
than in your checking account may not benefit you if service charges wipe out 
your interest earnings. This is especially true with interest rates at such relatively 
low levels.
Be sure to shop around for the best deals on your checking account because mini-
mum balance requirements, service fees, and interest rates vary. Credit unions 
offer some of the best deals, although they usually don’t offer extensive access to 
free ATMs (see Chapter 6). The largest banks with the most ATMs generally don’t 
have the best terms on checking and savings accounts.

s it true that only the rich get richer and that to get ahead, you have to know the 
right people?
I’ve never been a fan of the class warfare that too often permeates partisan politi-
cal discourse these days. One reason for my distaste is the simple truth that the 
facts are on the side of capitalism’s being the best system to allow folks of all dif-
ferent means to better their lives and enjoy a good standard of living.
Consider the opportunity to share in the upside presented by owning a stake in 
successful businesses. That’s exactly what you’re doing when you buy shares of 
stock, either through funds or directly through a stock exchange.
You don’t need big bucks or the right connections or inside information to earn 
handsome long-term returns in stocks. (Trading on true inside information can 
land you in legal hot water.) You simply need to read and digest the time-tested 
principles I present in this chapter.
I explain what stocks are, how you can make money with them, and the pros and 
cons of the various methods for purchasing them. I also detail how to time your 
purchases and sales and how to sidestep disasters and maximize your chances for 
success.

90      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
What Are Stocks?
Entrepreneurs start companies, and at some point in that process, perhaps even 
many years after the company was initially formed, company founders may sell a 
portion of their shares of ownership in the company known as stock. Some com-
panies choose to issue stock to raise money, whereas others choose to issue bonds, 
which are simply loans that the company promises to repay (see Chapter 9).
When you and other members of the investing public buy stock, these outside 
investors continue to hold and trade it over time. From time to time, some com-
panies may choose to buy back some of their own stock, usually because they 
think it’s a good investment, but they’re under no obligation to do so.
By issuing stock, company founders and employee–owners are able to sell some 
of their relatively illiquid private stock and reap the rewards of their successful 
company. Growing companies also generally favor stock offerings (over selling 
bonds to investors) because the company doesn’t want the future cash drain that 
comes from paying loans (bonds) back.
Although many company owners like to take their companies public (issuing 
stock) to cash in on their stake in the company, not all owners want to go public, 
and not all who do go public are happy that they did. One of the numerous draw-
backs of establishing your company as public includes the burdensome financial 
reporting requirements, such as publishing quarterly earnings statements and 
annual reports.
Regulatory required documents not only take lots of time and money to produce, 
but they can also reveal competitive secrets. Some companies also harm their 
long-term planning ability because of the pressure and focus on short-term cor-
porate performance that comes with being a public company.
From your perspective as a potential investor, you can usually make more money 
in stocks than bonds, but stocks are generally more volatile in the short term. You 
can also get burned when buying stock when a company is issuing new stock for 
the first time, through what is called an initial public offering (IPO).
Ultimately, companies seek to raise capital in the lowest-cost way they can, so 
they elect to sell stocks or bonds based on what the finance folks tell them is the 
best option. For example, if the stock market is booming and new stock can sell at 
a premium price, companies opt to sell more stock through an IPO. (Some have 
jokingly said that IPO may actually stand for “It’s Probably Overpriced!”)

CHAPTER 8  Getting Your Slice of Capitalism with Stocks      91
You generally should avoid IPOs, because newly issued stock more often than not 
declines or underperforms in price soon after the offering. Some companies opt 
for selling stock because they don’t like carrying debt.
When a company decides to issue stock, the company’s management team works 
with investment bankers, who help companies decide when and at what price to 
sell stock. When a company issues stock, the price per share that the stock is sold 
for is somewhat arbitrary.
The amount that a prospective investor will pay for a particular portion of the 
company’s stock should depend on the company’s profits and future growth 
prospects. Companies that produce higher levels of profits and grow faster gener-
ally command a higher sales price for a given portion of the company.
A stock’s price per share by itself is meaningless in evaluating whether to buy a 
stock. Ultimately, the amount that investors will pay for a company’s stock should 
depend greatly on the company’s growth and profitability prospects, which I dis-
cuss in the next section.
How (And Why) You Can Make  
Money with Stocks
Understanding why stocks tend to appreciate over time and produce better returns 
than bonds and bank accounts isn’t rocket science. It’s really pretty simple. In this 
section, I explain how corporate profits drive stock prices and the different ways 
you can make money from stocks.
Understanding the importance  
of corporate profits
The goal of most companies is to make a profit, or earnings. Earnings result from 
the difference between what a company takes in (revenue) and what it spends 
(costs). I say most companies because some organizations’ primary purpose is not 
to maximize profits.
Nonprofit organizations — such as the American Cancer Society, Goodwill, Red 
Cross, and numerous medical centers, colleges, and universities  — are well-
known examples. However, even nonprofits can’t thrive and prosper over the long 
haul without a steady flow of money.

92      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Companies that trade publicly on the stock exchanges seek to maximize their 
profit; that’s what their shareholders want. Higher profits generally make stock 
prices increase. Most private companies seek to maximize their profits as well, but 
they retain much more latitude to pursue other goals.
Among the major ways that successful companies increase profits are
»
» Building (or buying) a brand name: What comes to mind when you think of 
Amazon, Apple, Cheesecake Factory, CVS, eBay, McDonald’s, Microsoft, Target, 
and UPS? These are all powerful brand names that have taken their respective 
companies many years and many dollars to build. Companies with recogniz-
able and positive brand images enjoy more consumer traffic, sales, and profits.
»
» Containing costs: Well-managed companies continually search for ways to 
control costs. Lowering the cost of manufacturing their products or providing 
their services allows companies to offer their products and services at lower 
prices. Managing costs may help boost a company’s profits. The marketplace 
and a company’s reputation (and the threat of lawsuits) keep companies from 
cutting corners and making their products and services dangerous in some way.
»
» Developing superior products or services: Some companies develop or 
promote an invention or innovation that better meets customer needs. 
Smartphones, 3-D printers, home gutters that don’t require cleaning, hybrid 
vehicles, numerous biotechnology offerings — the list goes on. This progress 
is what keeps the American economy resilient and strong, regardless of the 
parade of knuckleheads in Washington.
»
» Monitoring competitors: Successful companies don’t follow the herd, but 
they do keep an eye on what their competition is up to. If lots of competitors 
target one part of the market, some companies target a less-pursued segment 
that, if they can capture it, may produce higher profits thanks to reduced 
competition.
»
» Selling products and services in new markets: Many successful U.S.-based 
companies, for example, have been expanding into foreign countries to sell 
their products. Although some product or service adaptation is generally 
required to sell overseas, selling a proven, developed product or service to 
new markets generally increases a company’s chances for success.
Making sense of how you profit with stocks
Company stock prices tend to rise over time as the company’s profits increase. So 
how do you make money investing in the company’s stock? When you purchase a 
share of a company’s stock, you can profit from your ownership in two ways:

CHAPTER 8  Getting Your Slice of Capitalism with Stocks      93
»
» Price appreciation: When the price per share of your stock rises to a higher 
price than you originally paid for it, you can make money. This profit, however, 
is only on paper until you sell the stock, at which time you realize a capital 
gain. Such gains realized over periods longer than one year are taxed at the 
lower long-term capital gains tax rate (see Chapter 4). Of course, the stock 
price per share can fall below what you originally paid, in which case you have 
a loss on paper unless you realize that loss by selling at a lower price than you 
paid for the stock.
»
» Dividends: Most stocks pay dividends. Companies generally make some 
profits during the year. Some high-growth companies reinvest most or all of 
their profits right back into the business. Many companies, however, pay out 
some of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends.
Your total return from investing in a stock, then, comes from dividends and stock 
price appreciation. Stocks differ in the dimensions of these possible returns, par-
ticularly with respect to dividends. (See the sections on stock funds and exchange-
traded funds in Chapter 10 for more information.)
Timing Your Stock Buying and Selling
One of the biggest temptations and one of the mistakes you’re most likely to make 
investing in stocks is trying to jump into and out of stocks based on your shorter-
term expectations of where a particular stock or the market as a whole may be 
heading.
In this section, I explain what the major market indexes mean and what value 
there may be in “following” any of them. I cover what measures might be useful 
in spotting when to buy and sell, and what problematic practices are likely to 
undermine your stock market investing success.
Following market indexes
You invest in stocks to share in the rewards of capitalistic economies. When you 
invest in stocks, you do so through the stock market. In the United States, when 
folks talk about “the market,” they’re usually referring to the Dow Jones Indus-
trial Average (DJIA), a widely watched U.S. stock market index created by Charles 
Dow and Eddie Jones of The Wall Street Journal. The DJIA market index tracks the 
performance of 30 large companies that are headquartered in the United States, 
but it’s not the only index.

94      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Indexes serve the following purposes:
»
» They can quickly give you an idea of how particular types of stocks are doing 
at the moment and over time.
»
» They enable you to compare or benchmark the performance of your stock 
market investments. If you invest primarily in large-company U.S. stocks, for 
example, you should compare the overall return of the stocks in your portfolio 
to a comparable index — in this case, the S&P 500 (which I define later in this 
chapter).
You may also hear about some other types of more narrowly focused indexes, 
including those that track the performance of stocks in particular industries, such 
as airlines, banking, energy, health care, retail, semiconductors, technology, and 
utilities. Other indexes cover other stock markets, such as those in the United 
Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, and Hong Kong.
Focusing your investments on the stocks of just one or two industries, especially 
those that aren’t major ones, or smaller countries is dangerous due to the lack of 
diversification and your lack of expertise in making the difficult decision about 
what to invest in and when. Thus, I suggest that you ignore these narrower 
indexes.
In addition to the DJIA, important market indexes and the types of stocks they 
track include
»
» Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500: Like the DJIA, the S&P 500 tracks the price of 
500 larger-company U.S. stocks. These 500 big companies account for about 
75 percent of the total market value of the tens of thousands of stocks traded 
in the United States. Thus, the S&P 500 is a much broader and more represen-
tative index of the larger-company stocks in the United States than is the DJIA.
»
» Russell 2000: This index tracks the market value of 2,000 smaller U.S. company 
stocks of various industries. Although small-company stocks tend to move in 
tandem with larger-company stocks over the longer term, it’s not unusual for 
one to rise or fall more than the other or for one index to fall while the other 
rises in a given year.
»
» Wilshire 5000: Despite its name, the Wilshire 5000 index actually tracks the 
prices of about 3,600 stocks of U.S. companies of all sizes — small, medium, 
and large. Thus, many people consider this index to be the broadest and most 
representative of the overall U.S. stock market.
»
» MSCI EAFE: Stocks don’t exist only in the United States. MSCI’s EAFE (Europe, 
Australasia, and Far East) index tracks the prices of stocks in the other major 
developed countries of the world.

CHAPTER 8  Getting Your Slice of Capitalism with Stocks      95
»
» MSCI Emerging Markets: This index follows the value of stocks in less 
economically developed but emerging countries, such as South Korea, Brazil, 
China, Russia, Taiwan, India, South Africa, and Mexico. These stock markets 
tend to be more volatile than those in established economies. During good 
economic times, emerging markets usually reward investors with higher 
returns, but stocks can fall farther and faster than stocks in developed markets.
Using price/earnings ratios to value stocks
You can’t compare different companies’ stock prices and determine from that 
which one(s) might be a better investment. The level of a company’s stock price 
relative to its earnings or profits per share helps you measure how expensively, 
cheaply, or fairly a stock price is valued.
Over the long term, stock prices and corporate profits tend to move in tandem. 
The price/earnings (P/E) ratio compares the level of stock prices to the level of cor-
porate profits, giving you a good sense of the stock’s value. Over shorter periods 
of time, investors’ emotions as well as fundamentals (data that can affect the per-
ceived value or price of a stock) move stocks, but over longer terms, fundamentals 
possess a far greater influence on stock prices.
P/E ratios can be calculated for individual stocks as well as entire stock indexes, 
portfolios, or funds. The P/E ratio of U.S. stocks has averaged around 15 over the 
past century. During times of low inflation, the ratio has tended to be higher — in 
the high teens to low twenties.
Just because U.S. stocks have historically averaged P/E ratios of about 15 doesn’t 
mean that every individual stock will trade at that P/E level. Faster-growing com-
panies usually command higher P/E ratios.
Though a stock price or an entire stock market may appear to be at a high price 
level, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the stock or market is overpriced. 
­Compare the price of a stock to that company’s profits per share or the overall 
market’s price level to the overall corporate profits. The P/E ratio captures this 
comparison. Faster-growing and more-profitable companies generally have 
higher P/E ratios (meaning that they sell for a premium). Also remember that 
future expected earnings, which are difficult to predict, influence stock prices 
more than current earnings, which are old news.
Most of the time, the stock market is reasonably efficient. By that, I mean that a 
company’s stock price normally reflects many smart people’s assessments as to 
what is a fair price. Thus, it’s not realistic for an investor to expect to discover a 
system for how to “buy low and sell high.” Few investors may have some ability 

96      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
to spot good times to buy and sell particular stocks, but doing so consistently is 
enormously difficult.
The simplest and best way to make money in the stock market is to regularly feed 
new money into building a diversified and larger portfolio. If the market drops, 
you can use your new investment dollars to buy more shares. The danger of trying 
to time the market is that you may be out of the market when it appreciates greatly 
and in the market when it plummets.
Avoiding temptations and hype
Because the financial markets move on the financial realities of the economy and 
companies, as well as on people’s expectations and emotions (particularly fear 
and greed), you shouldn’t try to time the markets. Knowing when to buy and sell 
is much harder than you may think.
As a young adult, you’re in a position to take more risks because you’re investing 
for the long haul. However, you should be careful that you don’t get sucked into 
investing a lot of your money in aggressive investments that seem to be in a hyped 
state. Many people don’t become aware of an investment until it receives lots of 
attention. By the time everyone else talks about an investment, it’s often nearing 
or at its peak.
Before you invest in any individual stock, no matter how great a company you 
think it is, you need to understand the company’s line of business, strategies, 
competitors, financial statements, and P/E ratio versus the competition, among 
many other issues. Selecting and monitoring good companies take research, time, 
and discipline.
Also, remember that if a company taps into a product line or way of doing busi-
ness that proves to be highly successful, that success invites competition. So you 
need to understand the barriers to entry that a leading company has erected and 
how difficult or easy it is for competitors to join the fray.
Be wary of analysts’ predictions about earnings and stock prices. Investment 
banking firm analysts, who are too optimistic (as shown in numerous indepen-
dent studies), have a conflict of interest because the investment banks that they 
work for seek to cultivate the business (new stock and bond issues) of the compa-
nies that they purport to rate and analyze.
Simply buying today’s rising and analyst-recommended stocks often leads to 
future disappointment. If the company’s growth slows or the profits don’t mate-
rialize as expected, the underlying stock price can nosedive.

CHAPTER 8  Getting Your Slice of Capitalism with Stocks      97
Psychologically, it’s easier for many folks to buy stocks after those stocks have 
had a huge increase in price. Just as you shouldn’t attempt to drive your car look-
ing solely through your rearview mirror, basing investments solely on past per-
formance usually leads novice investors into overpriced investments. If many 
people are talking about the stunning rise in the market, and new investors pile in 
based on the expectation of hefty profits, tread carefully.
I’m not saying that you need to sell your current stock holdings if you see an 
investment market getting frothy and speculative. As long as you diversify your 
stocks worldwide and hold other investments, such as real estate and bonds, the 
stocks that you hold in one market need to be only a portion of your total 
holdings.
Timing the markets is difficult: You can never know how high is high and when 
it’s time to sell, and then how low is low and when it’s time to buy. And if you sell 
non-retirement-account investments at a profit, you end up sacrificing a lot of 
the profit to federal and state taxes.
Getting past the gloom
During the 2008 financial crisis, panic (and talk of another Great Depression) was 
in the air, and stock prices dropped sharply. Peak to trough, global stock prices 
plunged more than 50 percent. While some companies went under (and garnered 
lots of news headlines), those firms were few and were the exception rather than 
the norm. Many terrific companies weathered the storm, and their stock could be 
scooped up by investors with cash and courage at attractive prices and 
valuations.
When bad news and pessimism abound and the stock market has dropped, it’s 
actually a much safer and better time to buy stocks. You may even consider shift-
ing some of your money out of your safer investments, such as bonds, and invest 
more aggressively in stocks. During these times, investors often feel that prices 
can drop farther, but if you buy and wait, you’ll likely be amply rewarded.
Sidestepping common investing minefields
Shares of stock, which represent fractional ownership in companies, offer a way 
for people of all economic means to invest in companies and build wealth. History 
shows that long-term investors can win in the stock market because it appreciates 
over the years. That said, some people who remain active in the market over many 
years manage to lose some money because of easily avoidable mistakes, which I 
can keep you from making in the future.

98      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
You can greatly increase your chances of investing success and earning higher 
returns if you avoid the following common stock investing mistakes:
»
» Broker conflicts: Some investors make the mistake of investing in individual 
stocks through a broker who earns commissions. The standard pitch of these 
firms and their brokers is that they maintain research departments that 
monitor and report on stocks. Their brokers use this research to tell you when 
to buy, sell, or hold. It sounds good in theory, but this system has significant 
problems. Many brokerage firms happen to be in another business that 
creates enormous conflicts of interest in producing objective company 
reviews. These investment firms also solicit companies to help them sell new 
stock and bond issues. To gain this business, the brokerage firms need to 
demonstrate enthusiasm and optimism for the company’s future prospects. 
Studies of brokerage firms’ stock ratings have shown that from a predictive 
perspective, most of their research is barely worth the cost of the paper that 
it’s printed on.
»
» Short-term trading: Unfortunately (for themselves), some investors 
track their stock investments closely and believe that they need to sell after 
short holding periods — months, weeks, or even days. With the growth of 
Internet and computerized trading, such shortsightedness has taken a turn 
for the worse as more investors now engage in a foolish process known 
as day trading, in which they buy and sell a stock within the same day! 
Whether you hold a stock for only a few hours or a few months, you’re not 
investing; you’re gambling. Specifically, the numerous drawbacks that I see 
to short-term trading include higher trading costs, more taxes and tax 
headaches, lower returns from being out of the market when it moves up, 
and inordinate amounts of time spent researching and monitoring your 
investments.
»
» Following gurus: It’s tempting to wish that you could consult a guru who 
could foresee an impending major decline and get you out of an investment 
before it tanks. Believe me when I say that plenty of these pundits are talking 
up such supposed prowess. From having researched many such claims (see 
the “Guru Watch” section of my website, www.erictyson.com), I can tell you 
that nearly all these folks significantly misrepresent their past predictions and 
recommendations. Also, the few who made some halfway-decent predictions 
in the recent short term had poor or unremarkable longer-term track records. 
As you develop your investment portfolio, take a level of risk and aggressive-
ness with which you’re comfortable. No pundit has a working crystal ball that 
can tell you what’s going to happen with the economy and financial markets in 
the future.

CHAPTER 8  Getting Your Slice of Capitalism with Stocks      99
Highlighting How to Invest in Stocks
When you invest in stocks, you have lots of choices. In addition to the tens of 
thousands of stocks to choose from, you can invest in mutual funds, exchange-
traded funds (ETFs), or hedge funds.
Investing in stock mutual funds  
and exchange-traded funds
Mutual funds take money invested by people like you and me and pool it into pro-
fessionally managed investment portfolios in securities, such as stocks and bonds. 
Stock mutual funds, as the name suggests, invest primarily or exclusively in stocks. 
(Some stock funds sometimes invest a bit in other stuff, such as bonds.)
If you’re busy and realize your lack of expertise analyzing and picking stocks, 
you’ll love the best stock mutual funds. Investing in stocks through mutual funds 
can be as simple as dialing a toll-free phone number or logging on to a fund com-
pany’s website, completing some application forms, and zapping off the money 
you want to invest.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are newer versions of mutual funds. The best ETFs 
are in many ways similar to mutual funds except that they trade on a stock 
exchange. The chief attractions are those ETFs that offer investors the potential 
for even lower operating expenses than those of comparable mutual funds.
The best stock mutual funds and ETFs offer numerous advantages:
»
» Diversification: Buying individual stocks on your own is relatively costly 
unless you buy reasonable chunks (100 shares or so) of each stock. But to buy 
100 shares each of, say, a dozen companies’ stocks to ensure diversification, 
you may need about $60,000 if the stocks you buy average $50 per share.
»
» Professional management: Even if you have big bucks to invest, funds offer 
something that you can’t deliver: professional, full-time management. Mutual 
fund managers peruse a company’s financial statements and otherwise track 
and analyze its business strategy and market position. The best managers put 
in long hours and possess lots of expertise and experience in the field.
»
» Low costs: To convince you that mutual funds and ETFs aren’t good ways for 
you to invest, those with a vested interest, such as stock-picking pundits, may 
point out the high fees that some funds charge. But high-cost funds aren’t the 
only ones out there. Through a no-load (commission-free) mutual fund or ETF, 
you can hire a professional, full-time money manager to invest $10,000 for a 
mere $10 to $50 per year.

100      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Mutual funds and ETFs, of course, have drawbacks:
»
» Less control: If you like being in control, sending your investment dollars to a 
seemingly black-box process in which others decide when and in what to invest 
your money may unnerve you. However, you should be more concerned about 
the potential blunders that you may make investing in individual stocks of your 
own choosing or, even worse, those stocks pitched to you by a broker.
»
» Taxes: Taxes are a concern when you invest in mutual funds and ETFs outside 
retirement accounts. Because the fund manager decides when to sell specific 
stock holdings, some funds may produce relatively high levels of taxable 
distributions. But you can use tax-friendly funds and ETFs if taxes concern you.
Picking your own stocks
Plenty of investing blogs, gurus, and books enthusiastically encourage people to 
do their own stock picking. However, the vast majority of investors are better off 
not picking their own stocks.
I’ve long been an advocate of people educating themselves and taking responsi-
bility for their own financial affairs, but taking responsibility for your own 
finances doesn’t mean you should do everything yourself.
Some popular investing websites and books try to convince investors that they can 
do a better job than the professionals at picking their own stocks. Amateur inves-
tors, however, need to devote a lot of study to become proficient at stock selection. 
Many professional investors work 80 hours a week at investing, but you’re unlikely 
to be willing or able to spend that much time on it.
INVESTING THROUGH HEDGE FUNDS
Like mutual funds, hedge funds are managed investment vehicles — an investment 
management team researches and manages the funds’ portfolio. However, hedge 
funds are oriented toward affluent investors and typically charge steep fees — a 
1.0 percent to 1.5 percent annual management fee, plus a 20 percent cut of the annual 
fund returns. Those high hedge-fund fees depress their returns.
Notwithstanding the small number of hedge funds that have produced better long-term 
returns, too many affluent folks invest in hedge funds due to the funds’ hyped marketing 
and the badge of exclusivity they offer.

CHAPTER 8  Getting Your Slice of Capitalism with Stocks      101
Researching individual stocks
When investing in stocks, I think you’re better off sticking to mutual funds and 
ETFs. In Chapter 10, I dive into far more detail about how to do just that. However, 
I realize that you may be interested in picking some stocks on your own.
You can spend hundreds of hours researching and reading information on one 
company alone. Therefore, unless you’re financially independent and want to 
spend nearly all your productive time investing, you need to focus on where you

Because discount brokers aren’t in the investment-banking business of working 
with companies to sell new issues of stock, discount brokers have a level of 
objectivity in their research reports that traditional brokers (ones like Merrill

» Successful money managers’ stock picks: To make money in stocks, you 
certainly don’t need an original idea. In fact, it makes sense to examine what 
the best money managers are buying for their portfolios. Mutual fund 
managers, for example, are required to disclose at least twice a year what 
stocks they hold in their portfolios. You can call the best fund companies and 
ask them to send their most recent semiannual reports that detail their stock 
holdings, or you can view those reports on many fund companies’ websites. 
Through its website, Morningstar allows you to see which mutual funds hold 

102      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
large portions of a given stock that you may be researching and what the 
success or lack thereof is of the funds that are buying a given stock. Finally, 
you can follow what Warren Buffett’s and other successful investors’ funds 
are buying by visiting the Securities and Exchange Commission website at 
www.sec.gov and looking up specific investment funds’ holdings (via their 
so-called 13F filings).

» Financial publications and websites: Many publications and websites cover 
the world of stocks. But you have to be careful: Just because certain colum-
nists or publications advocate particular stocks or investing strategies doesn’t 
mean that you’ll achieve success by following their advice. Hundreds of 
publications, blogs, and websites are devoted to stock picking. (Visit my site at

» Annual reports: Publicly traded companies must file certain financial 
documents annually. Consider reviewing these documents to enhance your 
understanding of a company’s businesses and strategies rather than for the 
predictive value that you may hope they provide. The annual report is a 
yearly report that provides standardized financial statements, as well as 
management’s discussion of how the company has performed and how it 
plans to improve future performance. While some companies have been 
sued for misleading shareholders with inflated forecasts or lack of disclosure 
of problems, know that responsible companies try to present a balanced —  
and, of course, hopeful — perspective in their annual reports.

» 10-Ks: 10-Ks are expanded versions of annual reports. Most investment 
professionals read the 10-K rather than the annual report because the 10-K 
contains additional data and information, especially for a company’s various 
divisions and product lines. Also, 10-Ks contain little of the verbal hype that 
you find in most annual reports. In fact, the 10-K is probably one of the most 
objective reports that a company publishes. If you’re not intimidated by 
annual reports or if you want more details, read the 10-Ks of the companies 
you want to check out. 10-Qs provide information similar to 10-Ks, but on a 
quarterly basis.

» Earnings calls: Listen to a recent earnings call. Earnings calls allow you to hear 
from management, as well as listen to the questions that professional analysts 
ask. Replays are often available on companies’ investor-relations websites.
Final thoughts on stock picking
Keep the amount that you dedicate to individual stock investments to a 
­minimum — ideally, no more than 20 percent of your invested dollars. I encour-
age you to do such investing for the educational value and enjoyment that you 
derive from it, not because you smugly think you’re as skilled as the best profes-
sional money managers. Unless you’re extraordinarily lucky or unusually gifted at 

CHAPTER 8  Getting Your Slice of Capitalism with Stocks      103
analyzing company and investor behavior, you won’t earn above-average returns 
if you select your own stocks.
Try to buy stock in good-size chunks. Otherwise, commissions gobble a large per-
centage of the small dollar amount you invest. If you don’t have enough money to 
build a diversified portfolio all at once, don’t sweat it. Diversify over time. Pur-
chase shares of one stock after you have enough money accumulated and then 
wait to buy the next stock until you’ve saved another chunk of money to invest.
Maximizing Your Stock Market Returns
Anybody, no matter what his or her educational background, IQ , occupation, 
income, or assets, can make solid returns investing in stocks.
To maximize your chances of stock market investment success, remember the 
following:
»
» Don’t try to time the markets. Anticipating where the stock market and 
specific stocks are heading is next to impossible, especially over the short 
term. Economic factors, which are influenced by thousands of elements as 
well as human emotions, determine stock market prices. Be a regular buyer of 
stocks with new savings. As I discuss earlier in this chapter, buy more stocks 
when prices are down and market pessimism is high.
»
» Diversify your investments. Invest in the stocks of different-size companies 
in varying industries around the world. When assessing your investments’ 
performance, examine your whole portfolio at least once a year, and calculate 
your total return after expenses and trading fees.
»
» Keep trading costs, management fees, and commissions to a minimum. 
These costs represent a big drain on your returns. If you invest through an 
individual broker or a financial advisor who earns a living on commissions, 
odds are that you’re paying more than you need to be, and you’re likely 
receiving biased advice, too.
»
» Pay attention to taxes. Like commissions and fees, federal and state taxes 
are major investment expenses that you can minimize. Contribute most of 
your money to your tax-advantaged retirement accounts. You can invest your 
money outside retirement accounts, but keep an eye on taxes (see Chapter 4). 
Calculate your annual returns on an after-tax basis.
»
» Don’t overestimate your ability to pick the big-winning stocks. One of the 
best ways to invest in stocks is through mutual funds and ETFs, which allow 
you to use an experienced, full-time money manager at a low cost to perform 
all the investing grunt work for you (see Chapter 10).

hen you invest, it’s fun and rewarding to see your investments grow 
over the years. Riskier investments like stocks and real estate can pro-
duce generous long-term returns, well in excess of the rate of inflation. 
But lending investments like bonds make sense for a portion of your money if
»
» You expect to sell some of those investments within five years. Stocks 
and other growth-oriented investments can fluctuate too much in value to 
ensure your getting your principal back within five years.
»
» Investment volatility makes you nervous, or you just want to cushion 
some of the volatility of your other, riskier investments. High-quality and 
shorter-term bonds tend to provide investors a smoother ride.
»
» You need more current income from your investments. Bonds tend to 
produce more income in the short term. That said, you need to be aware that 
dividend-paying stocks may offer more income over the long term, as their 
dividends tend to increase over time.

» You don’t need to make your money grow after inflation and taxes. 
Perhaps you’re one of those rare folks who has managed to amass a nice-size 
nest egg at a relatively young age, and you’re less concerned with growing that 
money.
Mind you, all these conditions need not apply for you to put some of your money 
into bonds. Also, this list isn’t meant to be an exhaustive list of reasons to invest 
some money in bonds.
In this chapter, I discuss how and why to use bonds in your investment portfolio, 
explain the different types of bonds as well as alternatives to bonds, and describe 
the best ways to invest in bonds.
Defining Bonds
Bonds are middle-ground investments. They generally offer higher yields than 
bank accounts and less volatility than the stock market. That’s why bonds appeal 
to safety-minded investors as well as to otherwise-aggressive investors who seek 
diversification or investments for short-term financial goals.
Bonds differ from one another according to several factors: the entities that issue 
the bonds (which has important associated tax implications), credit quality, and 
time to maturity. After you have a handle on these issues, you’re ready to consider 
investing in bond mutual funds, exchange-traded bond funds, and perhaps even 
some individual bonds (although I caution you especially against jumping into 
individual bonds, which can be minefields for inexperienced investors).
Unfortunately, due to shady marketing practices by some investing companies 
and bond salespeople, you can have your work cut out for you while trying to get 
a handle on what many bonds really are and how they differ from their peers. 
I walk you through how bonds differ from one another in this section.
Understanding bond issuers
A major dimension in which bonds differ is the organizations that issued the 
bonds. The issuer of a bond is actually borrowing money from the folks who buy 
the bonds when they’re originally sold.

CHAPTER 9  Securing Investment Income and Principal with Bonds      107
Who issues a bond is hugely important. First, it determines how likely the bond 
issuer is to be able to pay back the bonds’ principal when the bonds mature. Sec-
ond, the type of entity doing the bond issuance determines the taxation of the 
bond’s interest payments.
The following list covers the major options for who issues bonds (in order of pop-
ularity) and tells you when each option may make sense for you:
»
» Corporate bonds: Companies such as Boeing, Ford, Johnson & Johnson, and 
VISA issue corporate bonds. Corporate bonds pay interest that’s fully taxable 
at the federal and state levels. Thus, such bonds make sense for investing 
inside retirement accounts. Lower-tax-bracket investors can consider investing 
in such bonds outside a tax-sheltered retirement account. (Higher-tax-bracket 
investors should consider municipal bonds, which appear later in this list.)
»
» Treasury bonds: Treasuries are issued by the U.S. government. Treasuries 
pay interest that’s state-tax-free but federally taxable. Thus, they make sense 
if you want to avoid a high state income tax bracket but not a high federal 
income tax bracket. However, most people in a high state income tax bracket 
also happen to be in a high federal income tax bracket. Such investors may be 
better off in municipal bonds (explained next), which are both free of federal 
and state income tax (in their state of issuance). The best use of Treasuries is 
in place of bank certificate of deposits (CDs), as both types of investments 
have government backing. Treasuries that mature in the same length of time 
as a CD may pay the same interest rate or a better one.
Bank CD interest is fully taxable, whereas a Treasury’s interest is state-tax-free.
»
» Municipal bonds: Municipal bonds (muni bonds, for short) are issued by state 
or local governments. Muni bonds pay interest that’s free of federal and state 
taxes to residents in the state of issue. For example, if you live in New York 
and buy a bond issued by a New York government agency, you probably won’t 
owe New York state or federal income tax on the interest. The government 
organizations that issue municipal bonds know that the investors who buy 
these bonds don’t have to pay most or any of the income tax that is normally 
assessed on other bonds’ interest payments. Therefore, the issuing govern-
ments can pay a lower rate of interest. If you’re in a high tax bracket and want 
to invest in bonds outside of your tax-sheltered retirement accounts, compare 
the yield on a given muni bond (or muni bond fund) to the after-tax yield on a 
comparable taxable bond (or bond fund).
»
» Convertible bonds: Convertible bonds are bonds that you can convert under a 
specified circumstance into a preset number of shares of stock in the company 
that issued the bond. Although these bonds do pay taxable interest, their yield 
is lower than that of nonconvertible bonds because convertibles offer you the 
potential to make more money from the underlying stock.

108      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
»
» International bonds: You can buy bonds issued by foreign countries. These 
international bonds are riskier because their interest payments can be offset 
by currency price changes. The prices of foreign bonds tend not to move in 
tandem with U.S. bonds. Foreign bond values benefit from, and thus protect 
against, a declining U.S. dollar; therefore, they offer some diversification value. 
Conversely, when the U.S. dollar appreciates versus most currencies (which 
happened during the early 1980s, from 1995 to 2002, and during the early 
2010s), that lowers a U.S. investor’s return on foreign bonds.
Foreign bonds aren’t vital holdings for a diversified portfolio. They’re generally 
more expensive to purchase and hold than comparable domestic bonds.
TREASURY INFLATION-PROTECTED 
SECURITIES (TIPS)
The U.S. government offers bonds called Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). 
Compared with traditional Treasury bonds, TIPS usually carry a lower interest rate. The 
reason for this lower rate is that the other portion of your return with these inflation-
indexed bonds comes from the annual inflation adjustment to the principal you invest. 
The inflation portion of the return gets added back into the principal yearly.
If you invest $10,000 in an inflation-indexed bond, and inflation is 3 percent the first 
year you hold the bond, your principal increases to $10,300 at the end of the first year.
What’s potentially attractive about these bonds is that no matter what happens with the 
rate of inflation, investors who buy TIPS earn some return (the yield or interest rate 
paid) above and beyond the rate of inflation, especially when held to maturity. Thus, 
holders of inflation-indexed Treasuries can’t have the purchasing power of their princi-
pal or interest eroded by high inflation.
Because inflation-indexed Treasuries protect investors from the ravages of inflation, 
they represent less-risky securities. But consider this little-known fact: If the economy 
experiences deflation (falling prices), your principal isn’t adjusted down, so these bonds 
offer some deflation protection as well. Technically, the principal can’t fall below the 
original par amount, but it can decline back to that level. So if you buy a TIPS that was 
issued a while ago and it has had the principal factored higher due to inflation, you 
could suffer a declining principal if deflation occurs.

CHAPTER 9  Securing Investment Income and Principal with Bonds      109
Considering credit (default) risk
Closely tied to what organizations are actually issuing the bonds, bonds also differ 
in the creditworthiness of their issuers. Credit rating agencies such as Moody’s, 
Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch rate the credit quality and likelihood of default of 
bonds.
The credit rating of a bond depends on the issuer’s ability to pay back its debt. 
Bond credit ratings are usually done on some sort of a letter-grade scale. AAA 
usually is the highest rating, and ratings descend through AA and A, followed by 
BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, and so on.
»
» AAA- and AA-rated bonds are considered to be high-grade or high-credit- 
quality bonds. Such bonds possess little chance of default (a fraction of 
1 percent).
»
» BBB-rated bonds are considered to be investment-grade or general-quality 
bonds.
»
» BB- or lower-rated bonds are known as junk bonds (or as their marketed 
name, high-yield bonds). Junk bonds, also known as non-investment-grade 
bonds, are more likely to default; perhaps as many as 2 percent per year 
actually default.
To minimize investing in bonds that default, purchase highly rated bonds. Now, 
you might ask why investors would knowingly buy a bond with a low credit rating. 
They may purchase one of these bonds because the issuer pays a higher interest 
rate on lower-quality bonds to attract investors. The lower a bond’s credit rating 
and quality, the higher the yield you can and should expect from such a bond.
Poorer-quality bonds aren’t for the faint of heart, because they’re generally more 
volatile in value. I don’t recommend buying individual junk bonds; consider 
investing in these only through a well-run junk-bond fund. (Keep in mind that 
the volatility profile for a junk-bond fund is closer to stocks than it is for high-
grade corporate bonds.)
Making sense of bond maturities
Bonds are generally classified by the length of time until maturity. Maturity simply 
means the time at which the bond promises to pay back your principal if you hold 
the bond. Maturity could be next year, in 7 years, in 15 years, and so on.

110      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Bonds classifications are as follows:
»
» Short-term bonds mature in the next few years.
»
» Intermediate-term bonds come due within three to ten years.
»
» Long-term bonds mature in more than 10 years and generally up to 30 years.
A small number of companies (such as Coca-Cola, Disney, and IBM) issue 
100-year bonds. I don’t recommend buying such bonds, however, especially 
those issued during a period of low interest rates, because they get hammered 
if long-term interest rates spike higher.
You should care how long a bond takes to mature because maturity gives you some 
sense of how volatile a bond may be if overall market interest rates change. If 
interest rates fall, bond prices rise; if interest rates rise, bond prices fall. 
Longer-term bonds generally drop more in price when the overall level of interest 
rates rises.
If you hold a bond until it matures, you get your principal back unless the issuer 
defaults. In the meantime, however, if interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The 
reason is simple: If the bond that you hold is issued at, say, 4 percent, and interest 
rates on similar bonds rise to 5 percent, no one (except someone who doesn’t 
know any better) will want to purchase your 4 percent bond. The value of your 
bond has to decrease enough so it effectively yields 5 percent.
Most of the time, long-term bonds pay higher yields than short-term bonds do. 
You can look at a chart of the current yield of similar bonds plotted against when 
they mature — a chart known as a yield curve. At most times, this curve slopes 
upward. Investors generally demand a higher rate of interest for taking the risk of 
holding longer-term bonds.
Using Bonds in a Portfolio
Investing in bonds is a time-honored way to earn a better rate of return on money 
that you don’t plan to use within the next couple of years or more. Like stocks, 
bonds can generally be sold any day that the financial markets are open.
In this section, I discuss how to use bonds as an investment and explain how 
bonds compare with other lending investments.

CHAPTER 9  Securing Investment Income and Principal with Bonds      111
Finding uses for bonds
Because their value fluctuates, you’re more likely to lose money if you’re forced to 
sell your bonds sooner rather than later. In the short term, if the bond market 
happens to fall and you need to sell, you could lose money. In the long term, as is 
the case with stocks, you’re far less likely to lose money.
Following are some common situations in which investing in bonds can make 
sense:
»
» You’re looking to make a major purchase. This purchase should be one 
that won’t happen for at least two years. Examples include buying a car or a 
home. Short-term bonds may work for you as a higher-yielding and slightly 
riskier alternative to money market funds.
»
» You want to diversify your portfolio. Bonds don’t move in perfect tandem 
with the performance of other types of investments, such as stocks. In fact, in 
a poor economic environment (such as during the Great Depression of the 
1930s or the 2008 financial crisis), bonds may appreciate in value while riskier 
investments such as stocks decline.
»
» You’re interested in diversifying your long-term investments. You may 
invest some of your money in bonds as part of a long-term investment 
strategy, such as for retirement. You should have an overall plan for how you 
want to invest your money (see Chapter 2). Aggressive younger investors 
should keep less of their retirement money in bonds than older folks who are 
nearing retirement.
»
» You need income-producing investments. When you’re retired (probably 
much later in life) or not working, bonds can be useful because they’re better 
at producing current income than many other investments.
I don’t recommend putting your emergency cash reserve in bonds. That’s what a 
money market fund or bank savings/credit union account is for (see Chapters 6 
and 7).
Don’t put too much of your long-term investment money in bonds, either. Bonds 
are generally inferior investments for making your money grow. Growth-oriented 
investments — such as stocks, real estate, and your own business — hold the 
greatest potential to build real wealth.
Comparing other lending  
investments with bonds
As I explain in Chapter 1, lending investments are those in which you lend your 
money to an organization, such as a bank, company, or government, that typically 

112      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
pays you a set or fixed rate of interest. Ownership investments, by contrast, pro-
vide partial ownership of a company or some other asset, such as real estate, that 
has the ability to generate revenue and potential profits.
Lending investments aren’t the best choice if you really want to make your money 
grow, but even the most aggressive investors should consider placing some of 
their money in lending investments.
In this chapter, I focus on bonds, but I’d be remiss if I failed to point out that 
lending investments are everywhere: banks, credit unions, brokerage firms, 
insurance companies, and mutual fund companies. Lending investments that you 
may have heard of include bank accounts (savings and CDs), Treasury bills and 
other bonds, bond mutual funds and exchange-traded bond funds, mortgages, 
and guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs).
Bonds, money market funds, and bank savings vehicles are hardly the only lend-
ing investments. A variety of other companies are more than willing to have you 
lend them your money and pay you a relatively fixed rate of interest. In most 
cases, though, you’re better off staying away from the investments described in 
the following sections.
Too many investors get sucked into lending investments that offer higher yields 
and are pitched as supposedly better alternatives to bonds. Remember: Risk and 
return go hand in hand, so higher yields mean greater risk, and vice versa.
One of the allures of nonbond lending investments, such as private mortgages, 
GICs, and CDs, is that they don’t fluctuate in value — at least not that you can see. 
Such investments appear to be safer and less volatile. You can’t watch your prin-
cipal fluctuate in value because you can’t look up the value daily, the way you can 
with bonds and stocks.
But the principal values of your mortgage, GIC, and CD investments really do fluc-
tuate; you just don’t see the fluctuations! Just as the market value of a bond drops 
when interest rates rise, so does the market value of these investments — and for 
the same reasons. At higher interest rates, investors expect a discounted price on 
a fixed-interest-rate investment because they always have the alternative of pur-
chasing a new mortgage, GIC, or CD at the higher prevailing rates. Some of these 
investments are actually bought and sold, and behave just like bonds, among 
investors in what’s known as a secondary market.
If the normal volatility of a bond’s principal value makes you uneasy, try not to 
follow your investments so closely!

CHAPTER 9  Securing Investment Income and Principal with Bonds      113
In the sections that follow, I explain common lending investments that are often 
pitched as bond alternatives with supposedly more stable prices. You can find 
information on CDs in Chapter 6.
Guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs)
Through your retirement plan at work, you may be pitched to invest in 
guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs). The allure of GICs, which are sold and 
backed by insurance companies, is that your account value doesn’t appear to 
fluctuate. (Other insurer-backed investments sold to the public through brokers 
are similar.) Like one-year bank CDs, GICs generally quote you an interest rate 
for the next year. Some GICs lock in the rate for longer periods, whereas others 
may change the interest rate several times per year.
Keep in mind that the insurance company that issues the GIC does invest your 
money, mostly in bonds and maybe a bit in stocks. Like other bonds and stocks, 
these investments fluctuate in value; you just don’t see the fluctuation.
Typically once a year, you receive a new statement showing that your GIC is worth 
more, thanks to the newly added interest. This statement makes otherwise-­
nervous investors who can’t stand volatile investments feel safe and sound.
The yield on a GIC is usually comparable to those available on short-term, high-
quality bonds, yet the insurer invests in long-term bonds and some stocks. The 
insurer pockets the difference between what these investments generate for the 
insurer and what the GIC pays you in interest.
The insurer’s take can be significant and is generally hidden. Mutual funds and 
exchange-traded funds are required to report the management fees that they 
­collect and subtract before paying your return, but GIC insurers have no such obli-
gations. By having a return guaranteed in advance (with no chance for loss), you 
pay heavily with many GICs — an effective fee upward of 2 percent per year — for 
peace of mind in the form of lower long-term returns.
The high effective fees that you pay to have an insurer manage your money in a 
GIC aren’t the only drawbacks. When you invest in a GIC, your assets are part of 
the insurer’s general assets. Insurance companies sometimes fail, and although 
they typically merge with healthy insurers if that happens, you can still lose 
money. The rate of return on GICs from a failed insurance company is often slashed 
to help restore financial soundness to the company. So the only “guarantee” that 
comes with a GIC is that the insurer agrees to pay you the promised rate of interest 
as long as it is able.

114      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Private mortgages
To invest in mortgages directly, you can loan your money to people who need 
money to buy or refinance real estate. Such loans are known as private mortgages, 
or second mortgages if your loan is second in line behind someone’s primary 
mortgage.
You may be pitched to invest in a private mortgage by folks you know in real 
estate-related businesses. Mortgage and real estate brokers often arrange mort-
gage investments, and you must tread carefully, because these people have a 
vested interest in seeing the deal done. Otherwise, the mortgage broker doesn’t 
get paid for closing the loan, and the real estate broker doesn’t get a commission 
for selling a property.
Private mortgage investments appeal to investors who don’t like the volatility of 
the stock and bond markets and who aren’t satisfied with the seemingly low 
returns on bonds or other common lending investments. Private mortgages 
appear to offer the best of both worlds — stock-market-like returns without the 
volatility that comes with stocks.
One broker who also happens to write about real estate wrote an article describing 
mortgages as the “perfect real estate investment” and added that mortgages are 
a “high-yield, low-risk investment.” The writer/broker further gushed that 
mortgages are great investments because you have “little or no management, no 
physical labor.”
You may know by now that a low-risk, high-yield investment doesn’t exist. Earn-
ing a relatively high interest rate goes hand in hand with accepting relatively high 
risk. The risk is that the borrower can default — which leaves you holding the bag. 
(In the mid- to late 2000s, mortgage defaults skyrocketed.) More specifically, you 
can get stuck with a property that you may need to foreclose on, and if you don’t 
hold the first mortgage, you’re not first in line with a claim on the property.
The fact that private mortgages are high-risk should be obvious when you con-
sider why the borrower elects to obtain needed funds privately rather than through 
a traditional mortgage lender like a bank. Put yourself in the borrower’s shoes. As 
a property buyer or owner, if you can obtain a mortgage through a conventional 
lender, such as a bank, wouldn’t you do so? After all, banks generally give better 
interest rates. If a mortgage broker offers you a deal where you can, for example, 
borrow money at 9 percent when the going bank rate is, say, 5 percent, the deal 
must carry a fair amount of risk.
I recommend that you generally avoid investing in private mortgages. If you really 
want to invest in such mortgages, you must do some time-consuming homework 
on the borrower’s financial situation. A banker doesn’t lend someone money 
without examining a borrower’s assets, liabilities, and monthly expenses, and you 

CHAPTER 9  Securing Investment Income and Principal with Bonds      115
shouldn’t either. Be careful to check the borrower’s credit, and get a large down 
payment (at least 20 percent). The best circumstance in which to be a lender is if 
you sell some of your own real estate, and you’re willing to act as the bank and 
provide the financing to the buyer in the form of a first mortgage.
Also recognize that your mortgage investment carries interest-rate risk: If you 
need to “sell” it early, you’ll have to discount it, perhaps substantially if interest 
rates have increased since you purchased it. Try not to lend so much money on one 
mortgage that it represents more than 5 percent of your total investments.
If you’re willing to lend your money to borrowers who carry a relatively high risk 
of defaulting, consider investing in high-yield (junk) bond mutual funds or 
exchange-traded funds instead (see Chapter  10). With these funds, you can at 
least diversify your money across many borrowers, and you benefit from the pro-
fessional review and due diligence of the fund management team. You can also 
consider lending money to family members.
How and Where to Invest in Bonds
You can invest in bonds in one of two major ways: You can invest in a profession-
ally selected and managed portfolio of bonds via a bond mutual fund or exchange-
traded fund (ETF), or you can purchase individual bonds.
In this section, I help you decide how to invest in bonds. If you want to take the 
individual-bond route, I cover that path here, including the purchasing process 
for various types of bonds such as Treasuries, which are different in that you can 
buy them directly from the government. If you fall on the side of mutual funds and 
ETFs, see Chapter 10 for all the details.
Choosing between bond funds  
and individual bonds
Unless the bonds you’re considering purchasing are easy to analyze and homoge-
neous (such as Treasury bonds), you’re generally better off investing in bonds 
through a mutual fund or ETF. Here’s why:
»
» Diversification is easy with funds and much more difficult with individ-
ual bonds. You shouldn’t put your money in a small number of bonds of 
companies in the same industry or that mature at the same time. It’s difficult 
to cost-effectively build a diversified bond portfolio with individual issues 
unless you have more than $1 million that you want to invest in bonds.

116      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
»
» The best funds are cost-effective; individual bonds cost you more money. 
Great bond funds are yours for less than 0.5 percent per year in operating 
expenses (see Chapter 10). If you purchase individual bonds through a broker, 
you’re going to pay a commission. In most cases, the commission cost is 
hidden; the broker quotes you a price for the bond that includes the commis-
sion. Even if you use a discount broker, these fees take a healthy bite out of 
your investment. The smaller the amount you invest, the bigger the percent-
age bite. On a $1,000 bond, the commission fee can equal several percent.
»
» You have better things to do with your time than research bonds and go 
bond shopping. Bonds are boring, and bonds and the companies that stand 
behind them aren’t simple to understand. Did you know, for example, that 
some bonds can be called before their maturity dates? Companies may call 
bonds, which means they repay the principal before maturity, to save money 
if interest rates drop significantly. After you purchase a bond, you need to do 
the same things that a good bond fund portfolio manager needs to do, such 
as track the issuer’s creditworthiness and monitor other important financial 
developments. In addition to the direction of overall interest rates, changes in 
the financial health of the issuing entity company that stands behind the bond 
strongly affect the price of an individual bond.
Investing in Treasury bonds
If you want to purchase Treasury bonds, buying them through the Federal 
Reserve’s Treasury Direct program online is generally the lowest-cost method. 
The Federal Reserve doesn’t charge for buying Treasuries through these online 
accounts (www.treasurydirect.gov).
You may also purchase and hold Treasury bonds through brokerage firms and 
mutual funds. Brokers typically charge a flat fee for buying a Treasury bond. Buy-
ing Treasuries through a brokerage account makes sense if you hold other securi-
ties through the brokerage account and you like the ability to quickly sell a 
Treasury bond that you hold. Selling Treasury bonds held through the Federal 
Reserve is a hassle, as you must transfer the bonds out to a broker to do the selling 
for you.
The advantage of a fund that invests in Treasuries is that it typically holds Trea-
suries of differing maturities, thus offering diversification. You can generally buy 
and sell no-load (commission-free) Treasury bond funds easily and without fees. 
Funds, however, do charge an ongoing management fee. (See Chapter 10 for my 
recommendations of Treasury mutual funds with good track records and low 
management fees.)

CHAPTER 9  Securing Investment Income and Principal with Bonds      117
Investing in non-Treasury  
individual bonds
Purchasing other types of individual bonds, such as corporate and mortgage 
bonds, is a much more treacherous and time-consuming undertaking than buying 
Treasuries. Here’s my advice for doing it right and minimizing the chance of 
mistakes:
»
» Buy quality, not yield. Yes, junk bonds pay higher yields, but they also have a 
much higher chance of default. Also, did you know what a subprime mortgage 
was before it was all over the news that defaults were on the rise? (Subprime 
mortgages are mortgage loans made to borrowers with lower credit ratings 
who pay higher interest rates because of their higher risk of default.) You’re 
not a professional money manager who’s trained to spot problems and red 
flags; stick with highly rated bonds so you don’t have to worry about and 
suffer through these unfortunate consequences.
»
» Diversify. Invest in and hold bonds from a variety of companies in different 
industries to buffer changes in the economy that adversely affect one industry 
or a few industries more than others. Of the money that you want to invest in 
bonds, don’t put more than 5 percent in any one bond. Diversification requires 
a large amount to invest, given the size of most bonds, and trading fees erode 
your investment balance if you invest too little. If you can’t achieve this level of 
diversification, use a bond fund.
»
» Understand that bonds may be called early. Many bonds, especially 
corporate bonds, can legally be called before maturity. In this case, the bond 
issuer pays you back early because it doesn’t need to borrow as much money 
or because interest rates have fallen and the borrower wants to issue new 
bonds at a lower interest rate. Be especially careful about purchasing bonds 
that were issued at higher interest rates than those that currently prevail. 
Borrowers pay off such bonds first.
»
» Shop around. Just like when you buy a car, shop around for good prices on the 
bonds you have in mind. The hard part is doing an apples-to-apples compari-
son, because brokers may not offer exactly the same bonds. Remember that 
the two biggest determinants of what a bond should yield are its maturity date 
and its credit rating. Beware of using commission-based brokers. Many of the 
worst bond-investing disasters have befallen customers of such brokerage 
firms. Your best bet is to purchase individual bonds through discount brokers.

118      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Evaluating individual bonds  
you currently hold
Perhaps you’ve already bought some bonds or inherited them. If you already own 
individual bonds, and they fit your financial objectives and tax situation, you can 
hold them until maturity, because you already paid a commission when you pur-
chased them. Selling the bonds before their maturity would just create an addi-
tional fee. (When the bonds mature, the broker who sold them to you will probably 
be more than happy to sell you some more. That’s the time to check out good bond 
funds — see Chapter 10.)
Don’t mistakenly think that your current individual bonds pay the yield that they 
had when they were originally issued. That yield is the number listed in the name 
of the bond on your brokerage account statement. As the market level of interest 
rates changes, the effective yield (the interest payment divided by the bond’s price) 
on your bonds fluctuates to rise and fall with the market level of rates for similar 
bonds. So if rates have fallen since you bought your bonds, the value of those 
bonds has increased — which in turn reduces the effective yield that you’re earn-
ing on your invested dollars.

Investing in Funds: 
Mutual Funds and 
Exchange-Traded Funds
T
his chapter is all about investing through funds  — mutual funds and 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Mutual funds are simply pools of money 
from investors that a mutual fund manager uses to buy a bunch of stocks, 
bonds, and other assets that meet the fund’s investment criteria.
The best ETFs are quite similar to mutual funds  — specifically, index mutual 
funds. Such ETFs generally track a major market index. (Some ETFs, however, 
track narrowly focused indexes, such as an industry group or small country.) The 
most significant difference between a mutual fund and an ETF is that to invest in 
an EFT, you must buy it through a stock exchange where the ETF trades, just as 
individual stocks trade.
Different types of funds can help you meet various financial goals. You can use 
money market funds for something most everybody needs: an emergency savings 
stash of three to six months’ living expenses. Or perhaps you’re thinking about 
saving for a home purchase, retirement, or future educational costs. If so, you can 
consider some stock and bond funds.

120      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Because efficient funds take most of the hassle and cost out of deciding which 
companies to invest in, they’re among the finest investment vehicles available 
today. Also, funds enable you to have some of the world’s best money managers 
direct the investment of your money.
In this chapter, I discuss how to match funds to your investing objectives and 
assemble a portfolio of superior funds. I also cover alternatives to funds.
Understanding the Advantages of Funds
The best funds are superior investment vehicles for people of all economic means, 
and they can help you accomplish many financial objectives. The following list 
highlights the main reasons for investing in funds rather than in individual 
­securities. (If you want to invest in individual stocks, see Chapter 8.)
»
» Low cost: When you invest your money in an efficiently managed fund, it 
should cost you less than trading individual securities on your own. Fund 
managers can buy and sell securities for a fraction of the cost that you pay. 
Funds also spread the cost of research over many, many investors. The most 
efficiently managed mutual funds cost less than 1 percent per year in fees. 
(Bonds and money market funds cost much less — in the neighborhood of 0.5 
percent per year or less.) Some of the larger and more established funds can 
charge annual fees less than 0.2 percent per year; that’s less than a $2 annual 
charge per $1,000 you invest.
»
» Diversification: Funds generally invest in dozens of securities. Diversification 
is a big attraction for many investors who choose funds because proper 
diversification increases the chance that the fund will earn higher returns with 
less risk. Most funds own stocks or bonds in dozens of companies, thus 
diversifying against the risk of problems from any single company or sector. 
Achieving such diversification on your own is difficult and expensive unless 
you have a few hundred thousand dollars and a great deal of time to invest.
»
» Professional management: Fund investment companies hire a portfolio 
manager and researchers whose full-time jobs are to analyze and purchase 
suitable investments for the fund. These people screen the universe of 
investments for those that meet the fund’s stated objectives. Fund managers 
are typically graduates of the top business and finance schools, where they 
learned portfolio management, securities valuation, and securities selection. 
Many have additional investing credentials, such as Chartered Financial 
Analyst (CFA) certification. The best fund managers also typically possess 
more than ten years’ experience analyzing and selecting investments.

CHAPTER 10  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      121
For fund managers and researchers, finding the best investments is a full-time 
job. They do major analysis that you lack the time or expertise to perform. 
Their activities include assessing companies’ financial statements; interviewing 
company managers to hear the companies’ business strategies and vision; 
examining competitors’ strategies; speaking with companies’ customers, 
suppliers, and industry consultants; attending trade shows; and reading 
industry periodicals.
»
» Achievable investment minimums: Many mutual funds have minimums of 
$1,000 or less. Retirement-account investors can often invest with even less. 
Some funds even offer monthly investment plans so you can start with as little 
as $50 per month. ETFs are even better in this department because there are 
no minimums, although you need to weigh the brokerage costs of buying and 
selling ETF shares. (Some fund companies do offer their own and certain 
other companies’ ETFs free of brokerage fees).
»
» Funds to fit varying needs: You can select funds that match the ratio of risk to 
reward you need to meet your financial goals. If you want your money to grow 
over a long period, and if you can handle down as well as up years, choose 
stock-focused funds. If you seek current income and don’t want investments 
that fluctuate as widely in value as stocks do, consider some bond funds. If you 
want to be sure that your invested principal doesn’t decline in value because 
you may need to use your money in the short term, select a money market 
fund. Most investors choose a combination of these types of funds to diversify 
and to accomplish different financial goals.
»
» High financial safety: Fund companies can’t fail because the value of fund 
shares fluctuates as the securities in the fund rise and fall in value. For every 
dollar of securities that they hold for their customers, mutual funds and ETFs 
have a dollar’s worth of securities. The worst that can happen with a fund is 
that if you want your money, you may get less money than you originally put 
into the fund due to a market value decline of the fund’s holdings — but you 
won’t lose all your original investment. For added security, the specific stocks, 
bonds, and other securities that a mutual fund buys are held by a custodian, a 
separate organization independent of the mutual fund company. A custodian 
ensures that the fund management company can’t abscond with your funds.
»
» Accessibility: Funds are set up for people who value their time and don’t like 
going to a local branch office and standing in long lines. You can fill out a simple 
form (often online, if you want) and write a check in the comfort of your home 
(or authorize electronic transfers from your bank or other accounts) to make 
your initial investment. Then you typically can make subsequent investments by 
sending money electronically or other convenient methods. Many fund compa-
nies and investment brokerage firms also allow you to transfer money electroni-
cally back and forth from your bank account. Selling shares of your mutual fund 
usually is simple, too. Generally, all you need to do is call the fund company’s 
toll-free number, visit its website, or use its app to make the arrangements.

122      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Maximizing Your Chances for  
Fund Investing Success
I recommend using some straightforward, common-sense, easy-to-use criteria 
when selecting funds to greatly increase your chances of fund investing success. 
The criteria presented in this section have proven to dramatically increase your 
fund investing returns. (My website, www.erictyson.com, has details on research 
and studies that validate these criteria.)
Understanding the importance  
of performance and risk
A common and often costly mistake that many investors make when they select a 
fund is overemphasizing the importance of past performance. The shorter the 
time period you analyze, the greater the danger that you’ll misuse high past per-
formance as an indicator for a fund’s likely future performance.
High past returns for a fund, relative to its peers, are largely possible only if a fund 
takes more risk or if a fund manager’s particular investment style happens by luck 
to come into favor for a few years. The danger of a fund’s taking greater risk in the 
pursuit of market-beating and peer-beating returns is that it doesn’t always work 
the way you hope. The odds are great that you won’t be able to pick the next star 
before it vaults to prominence in the fund universe. You’re more likely to jump 
into a recently high-performing fund and then be along for the ride when it plum-
mets back to reality.
Some funds make themselves look better by comparing themselves with funds 
that aren’t really comparable. The most common ploy starts with a manager 
investing in riskier types of securities; then the fund company, in its marketing, 
compares its fund’s performance with that of fund companies that invest in less-
risky securities. Always examine the types of securities that a fund invests in and 
then make sure the comparison funds or indexes invest in similar securities.
A fund’s historic rate of return or performance is one of several important factors 
to examine when you select funds. Keep in mind that — as all fund materials must 
tell you — past performance is no guarantee of future results. In fact, many for-
mer high-return funds achieved their results only by taking on high risk or simply 
by relying on short-term luck. Funds that assume higher risk should produce 
higher rates of return, but high-risk funds usually decline in price faster during 
market declines.

CHAPTER 10  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      123
Examining fund management experience
Although the individual fund manager is important, a manager isn’t an island 
unto himself. The resources and capabilities of the parent company are equally, if 
not more, important. Managers come and go, but fund companies usually don’t.
Different companies maintain different capabilities and levels of expertise with 
different types of funds. A fund company gains more or less experience than 
­others not only from the direct management of certain fund types, but also 
through hiring out. Some fund families contract with private money management 
firms that possess significant experience. In other cases, private money manage-
ment firms with long histories in private money management — such as Dodge & 
Cox and Primecap Management — offer funds to the general public.
Keeping costs down
The charges that you pay to buy or sell a fund, as well as the ongoing fund operat-
ing expenses, have a major effect on the return that you ultimately earn on your 
fund investments. Given the enormous number of choices available for a particu-
lar type of fund, there’s no reason to pay high costs.
Fund costs are an important factor in the return that you ultimately earn from a 
fund because fees are deducted from your investment returns. High fees and other 
charges depress your returns. Here’s what I recommend you do regarding fees:
»
» Minimize operating expenses. All funds charge fees as long as you keep 
your money in the fund. The fees pay for the costs of running a fund, such as 
employees’ salaries, marketing, toll-free phone lines, and writing and publish-
ing prospectuses (the legal disclosure of the fund’s operations and fees).  
A fund’s operating expenses are invisible to you because they’re deducted 
from the fund’s share price on a daily basis. Funds with higher operating 
expenses tend to produce lower rates of return on average. Conversely, funds 
with lower operating costs can more easily produce higher returns for you 
than comparable types of funds with high costs. This effect makes sense 
because companies deduct operating expenses from the returns that your 
fund generates.
Fund companies quote a fund’s operating expenses as a percentage of your 
investment. The percentage represents an annual fee or charge. You can find 
this number in the fund expense section of a fund’s prospectus, usually on a line 
that says “Total Fund Operating Expense.” You also can call the fund’s toll-free 
phone number and ask a representative, or you can find the information at the 
fund company’s website. Make sure a fund doesn’t have lower expenses simply 
because it’s waiving them temporarily. (You can ask the fund representative or 
look at the fees in the fund’s prospectus to find this information.)

124      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
»
» Use no-load funds. A sales load is a commission paid to brokers and financial 
planners who work on commission and sell loaded mutual funds. Commissions, 
or loads, generally are about 5 percent of the amount you invest. Sales loads  
are additional and unnecessary costs that are deducted from your investment 
money. You can find plenty of outstanding no-load (commission-free) funds.  
I recommend a few later in this chapter.
Invest in funds that have low total operating expenses and that don’t charge sales 
loads. Both types of fees come out of your pocket and reduce your rate of return. 
Plenty of excellent funds are available at reasonable annual operating-expense 
ratios (less than 1 percent for stock funds and less than 0.5 percent for bond 
funds). See my recommendations of specific funds later in this chapter.
Note: Many of the Vanguard funds recommended in this chapter offer Admiral 
versions that have even lower operating fees for customers who invest at least 
$50,000, or $10,000 for an index or tax managed fund that offers Admiral shares. 
Some of Vanguard’s sector-focused Admiral funds have a $100,000 minimum.
Understanding and using index funds
In some funds, the portfolio manager and a team of analysts scour the market for 
the best securities. These funds are generally known as actively managed funds. An 
index fund, however, simply invests to match the makeup  — and, thus, the 
­performance — of an index such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 index of 500 large 
U.S.-company stocks. Index funds, also known as passively managed funds, operate 
with far lower operating expenses because ongoing research isn’t needed to iden-
tify companies in which to invest.
Index funds deliver relatively solid returns by keeping expenses low, staying 
invested, and not changing investments (unless changes occur to the securities in 
the underlying index). With actively managed stock funds, a fund manager can 
make costly mistakes, such as not being invested when the market goes up, being 
too aggressive when the market plummets, or just being in the wrong stocks. An 
actively managed fund can easily underperform the overall market index that it’s 
competing against. Over ten years or more, index funds typically outperform about 
three-quarters of their peers. Most so-called actively managed funds can’t over-
come the handicap of high operating expenses that pull down their rates of return.
In addition to lower operating expenses, which help boost your returns, index 
funds are usually tax-friendlier to invest in when you invest outside retirement 
accounts. Fund managers of actively managed portfolios, in their attempts to 
increase returns, buy and sell securities more frequently. This trading, however, 
increases a fund’s taxable capital gains distributions and reduces a fund’s after-
tax return.

CHAPTER 10  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      125
Vanguard is the largest and most successful provider of index funds because it 
generally maintains the lowest annual operating fees in the business. Vanguard 
has all types of bond and stock (both U.S. and international) index funds. See my 
recommended-fund sections later in this chapter.
Understanding exchange-traded funds: 
Index funds that trade
Index mutual funds, which track particular market indexes and the best of which 
feature low costs, have been around for decades. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 
represent a twist on index funds. ETFs trade as stocks do and offer some potential 
advantages over traditional mutual funds, but they also have some potential 
drawbacks.
As with index funds, the promise of ETFs is low management fees. I say promise 
because the vast majority of ETFs actually have expense ratios far higher than 
those of the best index funds.
In addition to slightly lower expenses, the best ETFs have one possible advantage 
over traditional index funds: Because ETFs may not be forced to redeem shares to 
cash and recognize taxable gains (which can happen with an index fund), they 
may be tax-friendlier for non-retirement-account investors.
If you can’t meet the minimum investment amounts for index funds (typically, 
several thousand dollars), you face no minimums when buying an ETF, but you 
must factor in the brokerage costs of buying and selling ETF shares through your 
favorite brokerage firm. Suppose you pay a $10 transaction fee through an online 
broker to buy $1,000 worth of an ETF. That $10 may not sound like much, but it 
represents 1 percent of your investment and wipes out the supposed cost advan-
tage of investing in an ETF.  Because of the brokerage costs, ETFs aren’t good 
vehicles for investors who seek to make regular monthly investments. (Note: Some 
brokers waive brokerage fees for trading their own ETFs and selected other ETFs.)
Here are some drawbacks of ETFs:
»
» The perils of market timing: Being able to trade in and out of an ETF during 
the trading day presents challenges. In my experience working with individual 
investors, most people find it both nerve-racking and futile to try to time their 
moves in and out of stocks with the inevitable fluctuations that take place 
during the trading day. In theory, traders want to believe that they can buy at 
relatively low prices and sell at relatively high prices, but that’s far easier said 
than done.

126      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
»
» Brokerage commission every time you trade: With no-load index funds, 
you generally don’t pay fees to buy and sell. With ETFs, however, because 
you’re actually placing a trade on a stock exchange, you generally pay a 
brokerage commission every time you trade. (Note: Some brokers offer 
certain ETFs without brokerage charges in the hope of getting your account 
and making money on other investments.)
»
» Fluctuating prices: Because ETFs fluctuate in price based on supply and 
demand, when you place a trade during the trading day, you face the 
complication of trying to determine whether the current price on an ETF is 
above or below the actual value. With an index fund, you know that the price 
at which your trade was executed equals the exact market value of the 
securities it holds.
»
» Poorly diversified investments: Many ETFs (that don’t invest in an index) 
invest in narrow segments, such as one specific industry or one foreign 
country. Such funds undermine the diversification value of fund investing and 
tend to have relatively high fees.
»
» Excessive risks and costs with leverage: ETF issuers have come out with 
increasingly risky and costly ETFs. One particular class of ETFs I especially 
dislike consists of so-called leveraged ETFs. These ETFs claim to magnify the 
move of a particular index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index, by 
double or triple. So a double-leveraged S&P 500 ETF is supposed to increase 
by 2 percent for every 1 percent increase in the S&P 500 index. My investiga-
tions of whether the leveraged ETFs actually deliver on their objectives show 
that they don’t — in fact, they don’t even come close. Leveraged ETFs aren’t 
investments; they’re gambling instruments for day traders.
Creating and Managing a Fund Portfolio
When you invest money for the longer term, such as for retirement, you can 
choose among the various types of funds that I discuss in this chapter. Most peo-
ple get a big headache when they try to decide how to spread their money among 
the choices. This section helps you begin cutting through the clutter for longer-
term investing. (I discuss recommended funds for shorter-term goals later in this 
chapter as well.)
Asset allocation simply means that you decide what percentage of your investments 
you place, or allocate, in bonds versus stocks and international stocks versus U.S. 
stocks. Asset allocation can include other assets, such as real estate and small 
business, which are discussed throughout this book.

CHAPTER 10  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      127
In your 20s and 30s, time is on your side, and you should use that time to your 
advantage. You may have many decades before you need to draw on some portion 
of your retirement-account assets, for example. If some of your investments drop 
in value over a year or even over several years, the investments have plenty of 
time to recover before you spend the money during retirement.
Your current age and the number of years until you retire are the biggest factors 
in your allocation decision. The younger you are and the more years you have 
before retirement, the more comfortable you should be with volatile, growth-
oriented investments, such as stock funds.
Table  10-1 provides my guidelines for allocating fund money that you’ve ear-
marked for long-term purposes, such as retirement. It’s a simple but powerful 
formula that uses your current age and the level of risk you’re willing to take with 
your investments.
Suppose you’re an aggressive type who prefers taking a fair amount of risk to 
make your money grow faster. Using Table 10-1, if you’re 30 years old, consider 
putting 10 percent (30 – 20) into bond funds and 90 percent (120 – 30) into stock 
funds.
Now divvy up your stock investment money between U.S. and international funds. 
Here are the portions of your stock allocation that I recommend investing in over-
seas stocks:
»
» 20 percent for a play-it-safe attitude
»
» 35 percent for a middle-of-the-road attitude
»
» 50 percent for an aggressive attitude
If, in Table 10-1, the 30-year-old aggressive type invests 90 percent in stocks, 
then she can invest about 50 percent of the stock fund investments (which works 
out to be around 45 percent of the total) in international stock funds.
TABLE 10-1

Aggressive

128      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
So here’s what the 30-year-old aggressive investor’s portfolio asset allocation 
looks like:
Bonds
10 percent
U.S. stocks
45 percent
International stocks
45 percent
Suppose your investment allocation decisions suggest that you invest 50 percent 
in U.S. stock funds. Which ones do you choose? As I explain in “Picking the best 
stock funds” later in this chapter, stock funds differ on several levels. You can 
choose among growth-oriented stocks and funds and those that focus on value 
stocks, as well as funds that focus on small-, medium-, or large-company stocks. 
I explain these types of stocks and funds later in this chapter. You also need to 
decide what portion you want to invest in index funds versus actively managed 
funds that try to beat the market.
Deciding how much you should use index versus actively managed funds is really 
a matter of personal taste. If you’re satisfied knowing that you’ll get the market 
rate of return and that you can’t underperform the market (after accounting for 
your costs), index your entire portfolio. On the other hand, if you enjoy the chal-
lenge of trying to pick the better managers and want the potential to earn more 
than the market level of returns, don’t use index funds at all. Investing in a happy 
medium of both, as I do, is always a safe bet.
Identifying the Best Mutual Funds  
and ETFs
In this section, I explain the different types of funds — stock, bond, and money 
market — and where to find the best ones. Remember that with stock funds and 
bond funds, you have the option of investing in ETFs as well as traditional mutual 
funds.
Investing in the best ETFs
Like the vast majority of investors, you don’t need to complicate your life by 
investing in ETFs. Use them only if you’re an advanced investor who understands 
index funds and you’ve found a superior ETF for a given index fund that you’re 
interested in.

CHAPTER 10  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      129
I strongly encourage you to employ the buy-and-hold mentality that I advocate 
throughout this book. Don’t hop in and out of ETFs. Also, you should buy only the 
ETFs that track the broader market indexes and that have the lowest expense 
ratios. Avoid those that track narrow industry groups or single small countries.
Check whether the ETF you’re considering is selling at a premium or discount to 
its net asset value. You can find this information on the ETF provider’s website 
after the market’s close each business day.
The best ETFs, like the best index funds, have low expense ratios. My top picks 
among the leading providers of ETFs include the following:
»
» Vanguard: Historically, Vanguard has been the low-cost leader with index 
funds, and now it has low-cost ETFs as well. If you’re interested in finding out 
more about ETFs, be sure to examine Vanguard’s ETFs. Vanguard also offers 
the Admiral Share class for bigger-balance customers (more than $100,000)  
of its index funds that match the low expense ratio on its ETFs. (https://
personal.vanguard.com/us/home; 800-662-7447)
»
» WisdomTree: This family of indexes is weighted toward stocks paying higher 
dividends. These ETFs have higher fees but offer a broad family of index 
choices for investors seeking stocks that pay higher dividends. Note: Other 
ETF providers offer several value-oriented and high-dividend-paying stock 
funds. (www.wisdomtree.com; 866-909-9473)
Three additional and larger providers of ETFs include the following firms (beware 
that some of their ETFs are pricey or too narrowly focused):
»
» iShares: BlackRock has competitive expense ratios on some domestic ETFs 
based on quality indexes, such as Russell, Morningstar, S&P, Lehman, Dow 
Jones, and so on. Fidelity offers dozens of iShare ETFs free of brokerage 
charges. (www.ishares.com; 800-474-2737)
»
» Schwab: The investment brokerage firm Charles Schwab, which revolution-
ized the discount brokerage business, offers many very low cost ETFs.  
(www.schwab.com; 800-435-4000)
»
» State Street Global Advisors SPDRs: This group uses indexes from Dow 
Jones, S&P, Russell, and MSCI, among others. (www.ssgafunds.com; 
866-787-2257)

130      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Picking the best stock funds
Stock funds differ from one another in several dimensions. The following charac-
teristics are what you should pay the most attention to:
»
» Company location: Stocks and the companies that issue that stock are 
classified based on the location of their main operations and headquarters. 
Funds that specialize in U.S. stocks are, not surprisingly, called U.S. stock funds; 
those that focus overseas typically are called international or overseas funds.
»
» Growth stocks versus value stocks: Stock fund managers and their funds 
are categorized by whether they invest in growth or value stocks.
•	 Growth stocks have high prices in relation to the company’s assets, profits, 
and potential profits. Growth companies typically experience rapidly 
expanding revenue and profits. These companies tend to reinvest most of 
their earnings in the company to fuel future expansion; thus, these stocks 
pay no or low dividends.
•	 Value stocks are priced cheaply in relation to the company’s assets, profits, 
and potential profits. Value stocks tend to pay higher dividends than 
growth stocks and historically have produced higher total returns.
»
» Company size: Another dimension on which a stock fund’s stock selection 
differs is based on the size of the company in which the fund invests: small, 
medium, or large. The total market value — capitalization, or cap for short — 
of a company’s outstanding stock defines the categories of the stocks that the 
fund invests in. Small-capitalization stocks are usually defined as stocks of 
companies that possess total market capitalization of less than $2 billion. 
Medium-capitalization stocks have market values of $2 billion to $10 billion. 
Large-capitalization stocks are those of companies with market values greater 
than $10 billion. (Note: These definitions can change over time.)
Putting together two or three of these major classifications, you can start to com-
prehend those lengthy names that are given to various stock funds. You can have 
funds that focus on large-company value stocks or small-company growth stocks. 
You can add U.S., international, and worldwide funds to further subdivide these 
categories into more fund types. So you can have international stock funds that 
focus on small-company stocks or growth stocks.
You can purchase several stock funds, each focusing on a different type of stock, 
to diversify into various types of stocks. Two potential advantages result from 
doing so:

CHAPTER 10  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      131
»
» Not all your money rides in one stock fund and with one fund manager.
»
» Each of the different fund managers can look at and track particular stock 
investment possibilities.
The following sections describe the best stock funds that are worthy of your 
consideration.
U.S. stock funds
Of all the types of funds offered, U.S. stock funds are the largest category. The only 
way to know for sure where a fund currently invests (or where the fund may 
invest in the future) is to ask. You can call the fund company that you’re interested 
in to start your information search, or you can visit the company’s website. You 
can also read the fund’s annual report. (The prospectus generally doesn’t tell you 
what the fund currently invests in or has invested in.)
Here’s my short list of U.S. stock funds:
»
» Dodge & Cox Stock (800-621-3979; www.dodgeandcox.com)
»
» Fidelity Low-Priced Stock (800-544-8544; www.fidelity.com)
»
» Harbor Capital Appreciation (800-422-1050; www.harborfunds.com)
»
» Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, Primecap, Selected Value, Strategic Equity, 
Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation, and Tax-Managed Small Capitalization 
(800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
International stock funds
Be sure to invest in stock funds that invest overseas for diversification and growth 
potential. You usually can tell that you’re looking at a fund that focuses its invest-
ments overseas if its name contains the word International, which typically means 
the fund’s stock holdings are foreign only. If the fund name includes the word 
Global or Worldwide, such funds generally hold both foreign and U.S. stocks.
Shun foreign funds that invest in just one smaller country. As with investing in a 
sector fund that specializes in a particular industry, this lack of diversification 
defeats a major benefit of investing in funds. Funds that focus on specific regions, 
such as Southeast Asia, are better but generally still problematic because of poor 
diversification and higher expenses than those of other, more-diversified inter-
national funds.
If you want to invest in more geographically limiting international funds, take a 
look at T. Rowe Price’s and Vanguard’s offerings, which invest in broader regions, 

132      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
such as investing just in Europe, Asia, and the volatile but higher-growth- 
potential emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America.
In addition to the risks normally inherent with stock fund investing, changes in 
the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar cause price changes in 
international stocks. A decline in the value of the U.S. dollar helps the value of 
foreign stock funds. Conversely, a rising dollar versus other currencies can reduce 
the value of foreign stocks. Some foreign stock funds hedge against currency 
changes. Although this hedging helps reduce volatility, it does cost money.
Here are my picks for diversified international funds:
»
» Dodge & Cox International (800-621-3979; www.dodgeandcox.com)
»
» Litman Gregory Masters’ International (800-960-0188; www.mastersfunds.com)
»
» Oakmark International and Global — holds some U.S. stocks (800-625-6275; 
www.oakmark.com)
»
» T. Rowe Price Spectrum Growth — actually a global fund that invests in some 
foreign stocks (800-638-5660; www.troweprice.com)
»
» Tweedy, Browne Global Value — invests in the United States as well (800-432- 
4789; www.tweedybrowne.com)
»
» Vanguard Global Equity (invests in the United States too), International 
Growth, Tax-Managed International, and Total International Stock Index 
(800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
Balancing your act: Funds that  
combine stocks and bonds
Some funds — generally known as balanced funds — invest in both bonds and 
stocks. These funds are usually less risky and less volatile than funds that invest 
exclusively in stocks. In an economic downturn, bonds usually hold value better 
than stocks do.
Balanced funds make it easier for investors who are skittish about investing in 
stocks to hold stocks because they reduce the volatility that normally comes with 
pure stock funds. Because of their extensive diversification, balanced funds are 
also excellent choices for an investor who doesn’t have much money to start with.
Balanced funds aren’t appropriate for some investors who purchase funds outside 
tax-sheltered retirement accounts because these funds pay decent dividends from 
the bonds that they hold. With the exception of the Vanguard Tax-Managed 

CHAPTER 10  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      133
Balanced Fund, which holds federal-tax-free bonds, you should avoid balanced 
funds if you’re in a higher tax bracket. Consider buying separate tax-friendly 
stock funds and tax-free bond funds to create your own balanced portfolio.
Here’s my short list of great balanced funds:

» Dodge & Cox Balanced (800-621-3979; www.dodgeandcox.com)
»
» Fidelity Freedom Funds and Fidelity Puritan (800-343-3548; www.fidelity.com)

(800-638-5660; www.troweprice.com)
»
» Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds, Wellesley Income, and Wellington (800-662- 
7447; www.vanguard.com)
Finding the best bond funds
Although there are thousands of bond fund choices, not many remain after you 
eliminate high-cost funds, low-performance funds, and funds managed by fund 
companies and fund managers with minimal experience investing in bonds (all 
key points that I address in “Maximizing Your Chances for Fund Investing 
­Success” earlier in this chapter).
Among the key considerations when choosing bond funds are
»
» Years to maturity: Bond-fund objectives and names usually fit one of three 
maturity categories: short-, intermediate-, and long-term. You can generally 
earn a higher yield from investing in a bond fund that holds longer-term 
bonds, but such bond prices are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. 
(Duration, which quantifies a bond fund’s sensitivity to changes in interest 
rates, is another term you may come across. A fund with a duration of eight 
years means that if interest rates rise by 1 percent, the fund should decline by 
8 percent.)
»
» Bond credit quality: The lower the issuer’s credit rating, the riskier the bond. 
As with the risk associated with longer maturities, a fund that holds lower-
quality bonds should provide higher returns for the increased risk you take.  
A higher yield is the bond market’s way of compensating you for taking 
greater risk. Funds holding higher-quality bonds provide lower returns but 
more security.
»
» Fees and costs: After you settle on the type of bonds you want, you must 
consider a bond fund’s costs, including its sales commissions and annual 
operating fees. Stick with no-load funds that maintain lower annual operating 
expenses.

134      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
»
» Taxability: Pay attention to the taxability of the dividends that bonds pay. If 
you’re investing in bonds inside retirement accounts, you want taxable bonds. 
If you invest in bonds outside retirement accounts, the choice between 
taxable and tax-free depends on your tax bracket.
»
» Type of bond issuer: Bonds can be issued by corporations, state and local 
governments, the federal government, and foreign entities (corporate and 
governments). Although some bond funds hold an eclectic mix, many focus 
on specific types of bonds (such as corporate bonds).
Because bond funds fluctuate in value, invest in them only if you have sufficient 
money in an emergency reserve. If you invest money for longer-term purposes, 
particularly retirement, you need to come up with an overall plan for allocating 
your money among a variety of funds, including bond funds.
The dangers of yield-chasing
When selecting bond funds to invest in, investors are often led astray as to how 
much they can expect to make. The first mistake is looking at recent performance 
and assuming that you’ll get that return in the future.
Investing in bond funds based on recent performance is particularly tempting 
immediately after a period where interest rates have declined, because declines in 
interest rates pump up bond prices and, therefore, bond funds’ total returns. 
Remember that an equal but opposite force waits to counteract high bond returns 
as bond prices fall when interest rates rise.
To make performance numbers meaningful and useful, you must compare bond 
funds that are comparable, such as intermediate-term funds that invest exclu-
sively in high-grade corporate bonds.
Bond funds calculate their yield after subtracting their operating expenses. When 
you contact a fund company seeking a fund’s current yield, make sure you under-
stand what time period the yield covers. Fund companies are supposed to give you 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yield, which is a standard yield 
calculation that allows for fairer comparisons among bond funds. The SEC yield, 
which reflects the bond fund’s yield to maturity, is the best yield to use when you 
compare funds because it captures the effective rate of interest that an investor 
can receive in the future.
If you select bond funds based on advertised yield, you’re quite likely to purchase 
the wrong bond funds. Bond funds and the fund companies that sell them can play 
more than a few games to fatten a fund’s yield. Higher yields make it easier for 
salespeople and funds to hawk their bond funds. Remember that yield-enhancing 
shenanigans can leave you poorer. Here’s what you need to watch out for:

CHAPTER 10  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      135
»
» Lower-credit-quality bonds: When comparing one bond fund with another, 
you may discover that one pays a higher yield and decide that it looks better. 
You may find out later, however, that the higher-yielding fund invests a 
sizeable chunk of its money in junk (non-investment-grade) bonds, whereas 
the other fund fully invests only in high-quality bonds.
»
» Longer-maturity bonds: Bond funds usually can increase their yield just by 
increasing their maturity a bit. So if one short-term bond fund invests in bonds 
that mature in an average of two years, and another fund has an average 
maturity of seven years, comparing the two is comparing apples and oranges.
»
» Return of principal as dividends: Some funds return a portion of your 
principal in the form of dividends. This move artificially pumps up a fund’s 
yield but actually depresses its total return. When you compare bond funds, 
make sure you compare their total return over time in addition to making 
sure they have comparable portfolios of bonds.
»
» Temporary waivers of expenses: Some bond funds, particularly newer ones, 
waive a portion or even all of their operating expenses to inflate the fund’s 
yield temporarily. Bond funds that engage in this practice often quietly end 
their expense waiver when the bond market is performing well.
Recommended short-term bond funds
Short-term bonds work well for money that you earmark for use in a few years, 
such as to purchase a home or a car, and for money that you plan to withdraw 
from your retirement account in the near future.
Short-term bond funds are the least sensitive to interest rate fluctuations in the 
bond-fund universe. The stability of short-term bond funds makes them appro-
priate investments for money on which you seek a better rate of return than a 
money market fund can produce for you. With short-term bond funds, however, 
you also have to tolerate the risk of losing a percentage or two in principal value if 
interest rates rise.
Consider bond funds that pay taxable dividends when you’re not in a high tax 
bracket and when you want to invest inside retirement accounts. My favorite is 
the Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade fund.
U.S. Treasury bond funds may be appropriate if you prefer a bond fund that invests 
in U.S. Treasuries, which possess the safety of government backing. They’re also 
a fine choice if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but are in a high state tax 
bracket (5 percent or higher). Vanguard Short-Term Treasury is a good choice.  
I don’t recommend Treasuries for retirement accounts because they pay less 
interest than fully taxable bond funds.

136      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
State- and federal-tax-free short-term bond funds are scarce. If you want short-
term bonds, and if you’re in a high federal tax bracket but in a low state tax 
bracket (less than 5 percent), consider investing in these federal-tax-free bond 
funds (whose dividends are state-taxable):
»
» Vanguard Short-Term Tax-Exempt (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
»
» Vanguard Limited-Term Tax-Exempt (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
If you live in a state with high taxes, consider checking out the state- and federal- 
tax-free intermediate-term bond funds (which I discuss in the next section) if 
you can withstand their volatility.
Recommended intermediate-term bond funds
Intermediate-term bond funds hold bonds that typically mature in a decade or so. 
They’re more volatile than shorter-term bonds but can also be more rewarding. 
The longer you own an intermediate-term bond fund, the more likely you are to 
earn a higher return on it than on a short-term fund unless interest rates continue 
to rise over many years.
As an absolute minimum, don’t purchase an intermediate-term fund unless you 
expect to hold it for three to five years — or even longer, if you can. Therefore, you 
need to make sure the money you put in an immediate-term fund is money that 
you don’t expect to use in the near future.
Taxable intermediate-term bond funds to consider include the following:
»
» Dodge & Cox Income (800-621-3979; www.dodgeandcox.com)
»
» Doubleline Total Return (877-354-6311; www.doubleline.com)
»
» Vanguard Total Bond Market Index and ETF (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
Consider U.S.  Treasury bond funds if you prefer a bond fund that invests in 
U.S. Treasuries, which provide the safety of government backing. You can also 
invest in them if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but are in a high state tax 
bracket (5 percent or higher). A couple of my favorites are Vanguard Inflation-
Protected Securities and Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury. I don’t recom-
mend Treasuries for retirement accounts because they pay less interest than fully 
taxable bond funds.

CHAPTER 10  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      137
Consider federal-tax-free bond funds if you’re in a high federal tax bracket but a 
relatively low state tax bracket (less than 5 percent). Good ones include
»
» Fidelity Intermediate Municipal Income (800-343-3548; www.fidelity.com)
»
» Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
If you’re in high federal and state tax brackets, refer to the state- and federal- 
tax-free bond fund company providers that I mention in the next section.
Recommended long-term bond funds
Long-term bond funds are the most aggressive and volatile bond funds around. If 
interest rates on long-term bonds increase substantially, you can easily see the 
principal value of your investment decline 10 percent or more.
Long-term bond funds are generally used for retirement investing in one of two 
situations by investors who
»
» Don’t expect to tap their investment money for a decade or more
»
» Want to maximize current dividend income and are willing to tolerate volatility
Don’t use long-term bond funds to invest money that you plan to use within the 
next five years, because a bond-market drop can leave your portfolio short of your 
monetary goal.
My favorite taxable bond fund that holds longer-term bonds is the Vanguard 
Long-Term Investment-Grade fund (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com). Also 
consider the Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF.
U.S.  Treasury bond funds may be advantageous if you want a bond fund that 
invests in U.S. Treasuries. They’re also great if you’re not in a high federal tax 
bracket but are in a high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher). I recommend 
Treasuries for non-retirement accounts only because Treasuries pay less interest 
than fully taxable bond funds. I recommend the Vanguard Long-Term Treasury 
fund (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com).
State and federally tax-free bond funds may be appropriate when you’re in high 
federal and state (5 percent or higher) tax brackets. A municipal (federal-tax- 
free) long-term bond fund that I recommend is Vanguard Long-Term Tax- 
Exempt. Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and Vanguard offer good funds for several states. 
If you can’t find a good state-specific fund where you live, or if you’re in a high 
federal tax bracket, you can use the nationwide Vanguard Municipal bond funds.

138      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Considering Alternatives  
to Investing in Funds
If you’re getting into the investment game, you’ll likely hear about, and be pitched, 
some alternatives to investing in funds. In this section, I reveal the truth about 
those options.
Your own online fund
On some websites, various services claim that you can invest in a chosen basket of 
stocks for a low fee and without the high taxes and high fees that come with 
mutual fund investing.
These “create your own funds” services pitch their investment products as supe-
rior alternatives to mutual funds. One such service calls its investment vehicles 
folios, charging you $29 per month ($290 per year paid in advance) to invest in 
folios, each of which can hold a few dozen stocks that are selected from the uni-
verse of stocks that this service makes available. The fee covers trading in your 
folios that may occur only during two time windows each day that the stock mar-
ket is open. Thus, in addition to the burden of managing your own portfolio 
of stocks, you have virtually no control of the timing of your trades during the 
trading day.
According to my analysis, you’d need to invest more than $150,000 through this 
folio service to come out ahead in terms of the explicit fees. You also need to be 
aware of additional fees, which you usually have to search the fine print to find. 
You may get whacked $30 to wire money out of your account or even $100 to close 
an account and have it transferred elsewhere!
Evaluating the performance of self-created funds is difficult. Also, unlike mutual 
funds, these funds have no standards or easily accessible services that report and 
track the performance of your customized folio.
Unit investment trusts
Unit investment trusts (UITs) have much in common with both mutual funds and 
exchange-traded funds. UITs take a fixed initial amount of money and buy 
­securities that meet the objectives of the UIT. Unlike a mutual fund, however, a 
UIT doesn’t make any changes in its holdings over time. This holding of a diversi-
fied portfolio can be advantageous because it reduces trading costs and possible 
tax bills.

CHAPTER 10  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      139
With that said, UITs do suffer from the following major flaws:
»
» High commissions: Brokers like to sell UITs for the same reason they like  
to pitch load mutual funds: the commissions paid out of your investment. 
Commissions usually are around 5 percent, so for every $10,000 that you 
invest in a UIT, $500 comes out of your investment and goes into the broker’s 
pocket. (Although UITs do have ongoing fees, their fees tend to be lower than 
those of most actively managed mutual funds — typically, in the neighbor-
hood of 0.2 percent per year. The best no-load funds also have reasonable 
management fees, and some charge even less than UITs charge.)
»
» Lack of liquidity: Especially in the first few years after a particular UIT is 
issued, you won’t readily find an active market in which you can easily sell 
your UIT. In the event that you can find someone who’s interested in buying a 
UIT that you want to sell, you’ll likely have to sell the UIT at a discount from its 
actual market value at the time.
»
» Lack of ongoing management oversight: Because UITs buy and hold a fixed 
set of securities until the UITs are liquidated (years down the road), they’re more 
likely to get stuck holding some securities that end up worthless. Compared 
with the best bond funds, bond UITs are more likely to end up holding bonds in 
companies that go bankrupt.
Brokerage managed accounts
Brokerage firms offer investment management services for an ongoing fee rather 
than commissions. (Merrill Lynch is one common example of a brokerage firm.) 
Wrap accounts, or managed accounts, go by a variety of names, but they’re the 
same in one crucial way: For the privilege of investing your money through their 
chosen money managers, they charge you a percentage of the assets that they’re 
managing for you. These accounts are quite similar to mutual funds except that 
the accounts don’t have the same regulatory and reporting requirements.
These managed accounts tend to have relatively high fees — upward of 2 percent 
per year of assets under management. No-load mutual funds and ETFs offer 
investors access to the nation’s best investment managers for a fraction of 
the cost of brokerage managed accounts. Many excellent funds are available for 
0.5 ­percent or less annually.
Hedge funds for the wealthier
Hedge funds, historically investments reserved for big-ticket investors, seem to 
be like mutual funds in that they typically invest in stocks and bonds. They have 

140      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
the added glamour and allure, however, of taking significant risks and gambles 
with their investments. Here’s how they stack up compared with mutual funds 
and ETFs:
»
» Hedge funds are often much higher-risk. When a hedge fund manager bets 
right, he can produce high returns. When he doesn’t, however, his fund can 
get clobbered. With short selling, because the value of the security that was 
sold short can rise an unlimited amount, the potential loss from buying it back 
at a much higher price can be horrendous. Hedge fund managers have also 
been clobbered when a previously fast-rising commodity, such as natural gas 
or copper futures, plunges in value or an investment they make with leverage 
goes the wrong direction. Several hedge funds went belly-up when their 
managers guessed wrong. In other words, their investments did so poorly that 
investors in the fund lost everything. This won’t occur with a mutual fund 
or an ETF.
»
» Hedge funds have much higher fees. Hedge funds charge an annual 
management fee of about 1 percent to 2 percent and a performance fee, 
which typically amounts to a whopping 20 percent of a fund’s profits.
»
» Hedge funds have had problems with fraud and lousy returns. During the 
severe stock market decline in the late 2000s, many hedge funds did poorly. 
Some funds went under or were exposed to be Ponzi schemes, the most 
notorious being the fund run by the now-jailed Bernie Madoff. According to 
Forbes magazine, “Hedge funds exist in a lawless and risky realm. . . . Hedge 
funds aren’t even required to keep audited books — and many don’t.” They’re 
often “guilty of inadequate disclosure of costs, overvaluation of holdings to 
goose reported performance and manager pay, and cozy ties between funds 
and brokers that often shortchange investors.” Objective studies of all hedge 
fund returns show that they underperform funds, which makes sense, 
because hedge funds have the burden of much higher fees.

Understanding 
Investment Brokers
A
s I discuss in Chapter 1, many investment firms vie for your business. In 
addition to the major fund companies (for example, Fidelity, T.  Rowe 
Price, Vanguard, and so on), investment brokerage firms are worth con-
sidering. There’s overlap among these firms because the leading fund companies 
also generally have brokerage offering and divisions.
In this chapter, I focus on brokerage firms and which ones may be worthy of your 
dollars and investments.
Getting Your Money’s Worth:  
Discount Brokers
When you hear the word discount, you probably think of adjectives like cheap, 
­inferior-quality, and such. However, in the securities brokerage field, the discount 
brokers who place your trades at substantial discounts can offer you even better 

142      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
value and service than high-cost brokers. The following list offers some of the 
reasons discount brokers give you more bang for your buck:
»
» They can place your trades at a substantially lower price because they have 
much lower overhead.
»
» They tend not to rent the posh downtown office space, complete with 
mahogany-paneled conference rooms, in order to impress customers.
»
» They don’t waste tons of money employing economists and research analysts 
to produce forecasts and predictive reports.
In addition to lower commissions, another major benefit of using discount bro-
kers is that they generally work on salary. Working on salary removes a significant 
conflict of interest that continues to get commission-paid brokers and their firms 
into trouble. People who sell on commission to make a living aren’t bad people, 
but given the financial incentives they have, don’t expect to receive holistic, in- 
your-best-interest investing counsel from them.
Assessing the high-commission  
salespeople’s arguments
One of the many sales tactics of high-commission brokerage firms is to try to 
disparage discounters by telling you, “You’ll receive poor service from discount-
ers.” My own experience, as well as that of others, suggests that in many cases, 
discounters actually offer better service.
Many of the larger discounters with convenient branch offices offer assistance 
with filling out paperwork and access to independent research reports. From dis-
counters, you also can buy no-load (commission-free) mutual funds that are run 
by management teams that make investment decisions for you. Such funds can be 
bought from mutual fund companies as well. (See Chapter 10 for more on these 
mutual funds.)
High-commission firms used to argue that discount brokerage customers received 
worse trade prices when they bought and sold. This assertion is a bogus argument 
because all brokerage firms use a computer-based trading system for smaller 
retail trades. Trades are processed in seconds. High-commission brokers also say 
that discounters are only “for people who know exactly what they’re doing and 
don’t need any help.” This statement is also hard to justify, especially given the 
abundance of financial information and advice available today.

CHAPTER 11  Understanding Investment Brokers      143
Selecting a discount broker
Which discount broker is best for you depends on what your needs and wants are. 
In addition to fees, consider how important having a local branch office is to you. 
If you seek to invest in mutual funds, the discount brokerage firms that I list later 
in this section offer access to good funds (you can access all exchange-traded 
funds through a broker because ETFs trade like stocks on exchanges). In addition, 
these firms offer money market funds into which you can deposit money awaiting 
investment or proceeds from a sale.
Within the discount brokerage business, deep discounters are firms that offer the 
lowest rates but fewer frills and other services. Generally, deep discounters don’t 
have local branch offices like big discounters do, and they also don’t offer money 
market funds with the highest yields.
Be careful of some deep discounters that offer bargain commissions but stick it to 
you in other ways, such as by charging high fees for particular services or offering 
below-market interest rates on money awaiting investment.
Here are my top picks for discount brokers:
»
» T. Rowe Price (800-225-5132; www.troweprice.com): T. Rowe Price offers a 
solid family of no-load mutual funds. The company’s brokerage fees are 
competitive and among those on the lower end for discounters. Its six branch 
offices are primarily in the Baltimore-Washington metro areas, Florida, 
and Colorado.
»
» Vanguard (800-992-8327; www.vanguard.com): Vanguard is best known for 
its excellent family of no-load mutual funds, but its discount brokerage 
services have improved over the years. Vanguard has also reduced its 
brokerage fees in recent years, and its prices are now near the low end of 
discount brokers.
»
» TD Ameritrade (800-454-9272; www.tdameritrade.com): This firm was 
created by the merger of TD Waterhouse with Ameritrade. TD Ameritrade 
offers competitive commission rates and more than 100 branch offices. The 
company offers round-the-clock customer assistance.
All the preceding firms offer mutual funds from many fund companies in addition 
to their family of funds (if they have a family of funds). In other words, you may 
purchase mutual funds that aren’t in the T. Rowe Price family of funds through 
the T. Rowe Price brokerage department. Other discounters certainly have good 
service and competitive rates, so shop around if you desire. Note, however, that 
you generally pay a transaction fee to buy funds from firms that don’t offer their 
own family of funds.

144      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Absent from my list are the large discounters Fidelity and Schwab. The simple 
reason they’re missing is that they charge significantly higher transaction fees 
than the competition does for many outside mutual fund family transactions. 
These firms can get away with premium pricing, despite comparable services, 
because enough investors prefer to do business with name-brand companies. 
Although I think that both companies can offer investors a fine base from which 
CAN FINANCIAL ADVISORS ACCESS BETTER 
FUNDS THAT AREN’T AVAILABLE TO YOU?
Some financial advisors promote their services in part by saying that they can get you 
into funds that are sold only through advisors. Please allow me to separate the hype 
from reality in assessing advisor/institutional funds.
Some investment management companies offer different share classes of some of their 
funds. Some of these are much-higher-minimum funds (for example, $100,000 or 
$1,000,000 minimum) that are targeted to wealthy individuals or institutions. Such 
funds tend to have slightly lower expense ratios, which of course should translate into 
slightly higher returns for the fund’s investors.
Some institutional funds can be accessed only by financial advisors. That said, that 
doesn’t mean that the funds an advisor can get you into are worthy of your investing 
dollars. Just because a fund restricts access, that doesn’t make the fund among the best 
to invest in (consider the many mediocre and lousy hedge funds).
The bottom line is that access to advisor/institutional funds is a consideration, a minor 
one, if and only if the advisor is actually doing a good job seeking out funds that are in 
your best interests and that have the best characteristics. You should evaluate a finan-
cial advisor on many factors, especially and including how the advisor is compensated 
and what conflicts of interest he or she may have.
Some of the larger fund companies, such as Vanguard and T. Rowe Price, offer lower-
expense, higher-minimum-investment fund share classes that are available to anyone 
who can pay the minimum. For example, Vanguard has “Admiral” funds, which have 
$10,000 minimums (for index funds) or $50,000 minimums (for actively managed 
funds). T. Rowe Price has higher-minimum “Summit” funds with a $25,000 minimum  
initial investment.
There are also exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as Vanguard’s, that generally have 
expense ratios that are even lower than or as low as their high-balance Admiral funds 
without having any minimum investment requirement. That said, you generally have to 
pay brokerage fees to buy and sell ETFs through a broker.

CHAPTER 11  Understanding Investment Brokers      145
to do their investing, I don’t feel that their fees are justified unless you want to do 
business with a broker that maintains a branch office in your area. If you’re going 
to invest in individual stocks, Schwab and Fidelity deserve more consideration 
because they offer a comprehensive array of useful and independent research 
resources, and their brokerage fees in that arena are more competitive.
Considering Online Brokers
To get the lowest trading commissions, you generally must place your trades 
online. Even if you’ve never visited an online brokerage site, ads for them online, 
in print publications, and even on national television have surely bombarded you. 
Visit any website that’s remotely related to investing in stocks, and you’re sure to 
find ads for various Internet brokers. Anyone familiar with the economics of run-
ning a brokerage firm can tell you that technology, when properly applied, reduces 
a broker’s labor costs. Some brokerages, thanks to technology, can now perform 
market orders (which means they’ll execute your trade at the best current available 
price) for a few bucks. Hence the attraction of online trading.
Before you jump at the chance to save a few dollars by trading online, read the 
following sections for other considerations that should factor in to your choice of 
an online broker or your decision to trade online at all.
Examining your online trading motives
If trading online attracts you, first examine why. If you’re motivated by how easily 
you can check account balances, beware. Tracking prices daily (or, worse, minute 
by minute) and frequently checking your account balances leads to addictive trad-
ing. A low fee of $5 or $10 per trade doesn’t really save you any money if you trade 
a lot and rack up significant total commissions, and you pay more in capital gains 
taxes when you sell at a profit. (That’s the big problem with some brokerage trad-
ing apps supposedly offering free trading; see Chapter 17.) Don’t forget that as 
with trading through a regular brokerage firm, you also lose the spread (difference 
between the bid and ask prices when you trade stocks and bonds) and incur the 
explicit commission rates that online brokers charge.
Frankly, trading online is also an unfortunately easy way for people to act impul-
sively and emotionally when making important investment decisions. If you’re 
prone to such actions or if you find yourself tracking and trading investments too 
closely, stay away from this form of trading and use the Internet only to check 
account information and gather factual information.

146      PART 3  Investing in Stocks, Bonds, and Funds
Investment websites also push the surging interest in online trading with the 
pitch that you can beat the market averages and professionals at their own game 
if you do your own research and trade online. Beating the market and profession-
als is highly unlikely. You can save some money trading online but perhaps not as 
much as the hype has you believe. Online trading is good for the convenience and 
low costs if you’re not obsessive about it.
Taking other costs into account
Online brokerage customers often shop for low costs. However, by simply talking 
with many folks who have traded online and by reviewing online forums where 
customers speak their minds, I’ve discovered that shopping merely for low-cost 
trading prices often causes investors to overlook other important issues. The big-
gest problem is firms that nickel-and-dime you with fees. For instance, some 
brokers whack you $20 here and $50 there for services such as wiring money or 
simply closing your account. Also beware of “inactivity fees” that some brokers 
levy on accounts that have infrequent trading. So before you sign up with any 
broker, make sure you examine its entire fee schedule.
Also beware below-market rates on money market accounts at many cut-rate 
brokers. When you buy or sell an investment, you may have cash sitting around in 
your brokerage account. Not surprisingly, the online brokers pitching their cheap 
online trading rates in 3-inch-high numbers don’t reveal their money market 
rates in such large type (if at all). Some don’t pay interest on the first $1,000 or so 
of your cash balance, and even then, some companies pay half a percent to a full 
percent less than their best competitors. In the worst cases, some online brokers 
have paid up to 3 percent less during periods of normal interest rates. Under those 
terms, you’d earn up to $150 less in interest per year if you averaged a $5,000 cash 
balance during the year.
Looking at service quality
Common complaints among customers of online brokers include slow responses 
to email queries, long wait times to speak with a live person to answer questions 
or resolve problems, delays in opening accounts and receiving literature, unclear 
statements, incorrect processing of trading requests, and slow web response dur-
ing periods of heavy traffic. With a number of firms that I called, I experienced 
phone waits of up to ten minutes and was transferred several times to retrieve 
answers to simple questions, such as whether the firm carried a specific family of 
mutual funds.

CHAPTER 11  Understanding Investment Brokers      147
When you shop for an online broker, check your prospects thoroughly. Here are 
some things to do:
»
» Call for literature and to see how long it takes you to reach a live human 
being. Ask some questions and see how knowledgeable and helpful the 
representatives are. For nonretirement accounts, if you want to gauge the 
quality of the firm’s year-end account statements, ask prospective brokerages 
to send you a sample. If you’re a mutual fund investor, check out the quality of 
the funds that the company offers. In other words, don’t let the sheer number 
of funds that the company offers impress you. Also, inquire about the interest 
rates that the company pays on cash balances. Try sending some questions to 
the broker’s website and see how accurate and timely the response is.
»
» Consider checking online forums to see what current and past custom-
ers say about the firms you’re considering. Most online brokers that have 
been around for more than six months lay claim to a number-one rating with 
some survey or ranking of online brokers. Place little value on such claims.
»
» Examine what the firm did before it got into the online brokerage 
business. Would you rather put your money and trust in the hands of an 
established and respected financial service company that has been around for 
a number of years or an upstart firm run by a couple of people hoping to 
strike it rich on the Internet? Transact business only with firms that offer 
sufficient account insurance (enough to protect your assets) through the 
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). The severe stock market 
downturns in the early and late 2000s led to major shakeouts, and you need 
to protect yourself.

WHY YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR SECURITIES 
IN A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT
When most investors purchase stocks or bonds today, they don’t receive the actual 
paper certificate demonstrating ownership. Brokerage accounts often hold the certifi-
cate for your stocks and bonds on your behalf. Holding your securities through a broker-
age account is beneficial because most brokers charge an extra fee to issue certificates.
Sometimes people hold stock and bond certificates themselves, though this practice 
was more common among previous generations. The reason: During the Great 
Depression, many brokerage firms failed and took people’s assets down with their sink-
ing ships. Since then, various reforms have greatly strengthened the safety of money 
and the securities that you hold in a brokerage account.
Just as the FDIC insurance system backs up money in bank accounts, the Securities 
Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) provides insurance to investment brokerage firm 
customers. The base level of insurance is $500,000 per account. However, many firms 
purchase additional protection, some as high as $100 million total!
Brokerage firms don’t often fail these days, but unlike during the Depression, the SIPC 
protects you if they do. However, the SIPC coverage doesn’t protect you against a falling 
stock market. If you invest your money in stocks or bonds that drop in value, that’s your 
own problem!
Besides not having to worry about losing your securities if a brokerage firm fails, 
another good reason to hold securities with a broker is so you don’t lose them, literally! 
Surprising numbers of people, the exact number is unknown, have lost their stock and 
bond certificates. Those who realize their loss can contact the issuing firms to replace 
them, but doing so takes a good deal of time. However, just like future goals and plans, 
some certificates are simply lost, and owners never realize their loss. This financial 
fiasco sometimes happens when people die and their heirs don’t know where to look 
for the certificates or the securities that their loved ones held.
Another reason to hold your securities in a brokerage account is that doing so cuts 
down on processing all those dividend checks. For example, if you own a dozen stocks 
and each pays you a quarterly dividend, you must receive, endorse, and otherwise deal 
with 48 separate checks. Some people enjoy this practice, they say that doing so is part 
of the “fun” of owning securities. My advice: Stick all your securities in one brokerage 
account that holds your paid dividends. Brokerage accounts offer you the ability to 
move these payments into a reasonably good-yielding money market fund. Most of the 
better discount brokers even allow you to reinvest stock dividends in the purchase of 
more shares of that stock at no charge.

Seeking Shelter and

Real Estate
T
hinking of a home in which you live as an investment may seem like a poor 
idea to you. In many parts of the country, home prices suffered in the late 
2000s and early 2010s.
Although homes may require plenty of financial feeding, over the course of your 
adult years, owning rather than renting a home can make and save you money. 
The pile of mortgage debt seems daunting in the years just after your purchase, 
but someday your home may be among your biggest assets.
Like stocks, real estate does well over the long term but doesn’t go continuously 
higher. Astute investors take advantage of down periods; they consider these peri-
ods to be times to buy at lower prices, just as they do when their favorite retailers 
are having a sale.

152      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Comparing Owning a Home to Renting
As financial decisions go, deciding whether and when to buy a home is pretty chal-
lenging. You have plenty of financial considerations to contend with, as well as 
personal issues. Psychologically, many folks equate buying a home with settling 
down. After all, you’ll be coming home to your home day after day, year after year. 
You can always move, of course, but doing so can be costly and time-consuming, 
and as a homeowner, you’ll have a financial obligation to deal with.
In this section, I cover the important issues to consider when comparing buying 
to renting.
Weighing financial considerations
You’ve probably already heard some arguments regarding the supposed financial 
benefits of owning a home. These benefits include the notion of buying and own-
ing a home for the tax breaks, as well as the thought that paying rent is analogous 
to throwing your money away.
The biggest homeownership costs are mortgage interest and property taxes, and 
in the United States, these costs are generally tax-deductible. The tax breaks are 
already largely factored into the higher cost of owning a home, however, so you 
should never buy a home just because of the tax breaks.
Renting isn’t necessarily like throwing your money away. In fact, renting can have 
several benefits, including the following:
»
» Renting sometimes costs less (sometimes much less) than owning. In the 
mid-2000s, in some parts of the country, renting a given property cost about 
half as much as owning that same property (a monthly comparison even after 
factoring in the tax benefits of owning).
»
» You may be able to save more toward your personal and financial goals 
if you can rent at a relatively low cost. You can invest, for example, in other 
financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and funds (and may be able to do so 
through tax-favored accounts).
»
» Renting has potential emotional and psychological rewards. You usually 
have more flexibility to pack up and move on as a renter. You may have a 
lease to fulfill, but you may be able to renegotiate it if circumstances require 
you to move. As a homeowner, you have some major monthly payments to 
take care of. To some people, this responsibility feels like a financial ball and 
chain. After all, you have no guarantee that you will be able to sell your home 
in a timely fashion or at the price you desire if you want or need to move.

CHAPTER 12  Seeking Shelter and Appreciation in Real Estate      153
Renting does have at least one big drawback: exposure to inflation (cost-of-living 
increases). As the cost of living increases, unless you live in a rent-controlled unit, 
your landlord can keep increasing your rent. By contrast, if you’re a homeowner, 
your largest monthly expense  — the mortgage payment  — doesn’t increase, 
assuming that you buy your home with a fixed-rate mortgage. Your property 
taxes, homeowner’s insurance, and maintenance expenses are exposed to infla-
tion, but these expenses are usually much smaller in comparison with your 
monthly mortgage payment.
Considering costs and your time frame
You face significant costs when buying and selling a home. My analysis suggests 
that you probably need at least three to five years of low to moderate appreciation 
to recoup your transaction costs. Some of the expenses you face when buying and 
selling a home include the following:
»
» Agent’s commission: Real estate agents generally charge a commission of 
5 percent to 7 percent of the purchase price. Even if the seller is technically 
paying the commission out of the proceeds that he or she receives from 
selling a home, both the buyer and seller of a home are effectively paying 
commissions because those costs are built into the home’s sale price. (You 
may be able to reduce these costs somewhat by doing the selling yourself, but 
a buyer may offer less, knowing that you’re not having to pay commission.)
»
» Inspection fees: When you buy a property, you should hire a professional to 
thoroughly check it out. Good inspectors can help you identify problems with 
the plumbing, heating, electrical systems, foundation, roof, pests like termites, 
and so on. Property inspections typically cost at least a few hundred dollars 
up to $1,000 for larger homes.
»
» Moving expenses: Moving costs vary wildly, but you can count on spending 
hundreds to thousands of dollars. Costs increase with the distance you have 
to go and the amount of stuff you have, of course.
»
» Mortgage costs: The costs of getting a mortgage include such items as the 
points (up-front interest — about 1 percent to 2 percent of the loan amount), 
application and credit report fees, and appraisal fees.
»
» Title insurance: When you buy a home, you and your lender will want to 
protect yourselves against the small probability that the property seller doesn’t 
actually legally own the home that you’re buying. Title insurance protects you 
financially from unscrupulous sellers. Although title insurance costs vary by 
area, 0.5 percent of the purchase price of the property is about average.
On top of all these transaction costs of buying and then selling a home, you face 
maintenance expenses — repairs, cosmetic work, and so on — during your years 
of home ownership. To cover the typical transaction and maintenance costs of 

154      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
homeownership, the value of your home needs to appreciate about 15 percent over 
the years that you own it for you to be as well off financially as if you’d continued 
renting. Counting on that kind of appreciation in case you need or want to move 
elsewhere in a few years is risky.
Some people invest in real estate even when they don’t expect to live in the home 
long, and they may consider turning their home into a rental if they move within 
a few years. Doing so can work well financially in the long haul, but don’t under-
estimate the responsibilities that come with rental property. See the section 
“Investing in Investment Real Estate” later in this chapter.
Deciding when to buy
If you’re considering buying a home, you may be concerned about whether home 
prices are poised to rise or fall. No one wants to purchase a home that then plum-
mets in value. And who wouldn’t like to buy just before prices zoom higher?
It’s not easy to predict what’s going to happen with real estate prices in a particu-
lar town or neighborhood over the next few years. Ultimately, the economic health 
and vitality of an area drive the demand and prices for homes in that area. An 
increase in jobs, particularly ones that pay well, increases the demand for hous-
ing, and when demand goes up, so do prices.
If you buy your first home when you’re in your 20s or 30s, you will likely be a 
homeowner for many decades. Over such a long time, you will surely experience 
numerous ups and downs. But you’ll probably see more ups than downs, so don’t 
be too concerned about trying to predict what’s going to happen to the real estate 
market in the near term and whether prices may fall a little. You should do a basic 
rent-versus-buy comparison, of course, to see whether the properties you’re con-
sidering offer decent value or not. A silver lining of the late-2000s decline in home 
prices is that homes were more affordable than they had been in a long time and 
offered better value versus renting in many areas.
That said, at particular times in your life, you may be ambivalent about buying a 
home. Perhaps you’re not sure whether you’ll stay put for five years. Therefore, 
part of your home-buying decision may hinge on whether current home prices 
versus the costs of renting in your local area offer you a good value. The state of 
the job market, the number of home listings for sale, and the level of real estate 
prices compared with rent are useful indicators of the housing market’s health.
Trying to time your purchase has more importance if you think you may move 
within a few years. In that case, avoid buying in a market where home prices are 
relatively high compared with rental costs. If you expect to move so soon, renting 
generally makes sense because of the high transaction costs of buying and selling 
real estate.

CHAPTER 12  Seeking Shelter and Appreciation in Real Estate      155
Figuring Your Home-Buying Budget
Buying a home is a long-term financial commitment. You’ll probably take out a 
15- or 30-year mortgage to finance your purchase, and the home you buy will 
need maintenance over time. So before you decide to buy, take stock of your over-
all financial health, determine how large a down payment you’ll need, and under-
stand how much lenders will be willing to lend you.
Getting your financial house in order
To qualify for a mortgage, you need good credit and a stable, reliable source of 
employment income. Mortgage lenders will tell you the maximum amount that 
you’re qualified to borrow. Just because they offer you that maximum amount, 
however, doesn’t mean you should borrow that much.
Buying a home without considering your other monthly expenditures and long-
term goals may cause you to end up with a home that dictates much of your future 
spending. Have you considered, for example, how much you need to save monthly 
to reach your goals? How about the amount you want to spend on your current 
lifestyle?
If you want to continue your current lifestyle, you have to be honest with yourself 
about how much you can really afford to spend as a homeowner. First-time home 
buyers in particular run into financial trouble when they don’t understand their 
current spending.
Buying a home can be a wise decision, but it can also be a huge burden. Also, you 
can buy all sorts of nifty things for a home. Some people prop up their spending 
habits with credit cards — a dangerous practice. So before you buy a property or 
agree to a particular mortgage, be sure you can afford to do so and that it fits with 
your overall plans and desires.
Determining your down payment
When deciding how much to borrow for a home purchase, keep in mind that most 
lenders require you to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI) if your down 
payment is less than 20 percent of your home’s purchase price. PMI protects the 
lender from getting stuck with a property that may be worth less than the mort-
gage you owe, in the event that you default on your loan. On a moderate-size loan, 
PMI can add hundreds of dollars per year to your payments.

156      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
If you have to purchase PMI to buy a home with less than 20 percent down, keep 
an eye on your home’s value and your loan balance. Over time, your property 
should appreciate, and your loan balance should decrease as you make monthly 
payments. After your mortgage represents 80 percent or less of the market value 
of the home, you can get rid of the PMI. Doing so usually entails contacting your 
lender and paying for an appraisal.
I’ve never liked interest-only loans, which entice cash-strapped buyers with 
lower monthly payments because all the initial payments go toward interest. 
These loans typically have higher interest rates and fees than conventional mort-
gages do, and they cause some buyers to take on more debt than they can handle. 
(After a certain number of years, the payment amount jumps higher when the 
principal and interest begin to be repaid together.)
What if you can afford to make more than a 20 percent down payment? How much 
should you put down then? (This problem is rare; most buyers, especially first-
time buyers, struggle to get a 20 percent down payment together.) The answer 
depends on what else you can or want to do with the money. If you’re considering 
other investment opportunities, determine whether you can expect to earn a 
higher rate of return on those other investments versus the interest rate that 
you’d pay on the mortgage. (Forget about the tax deduction for your mortgage 
interest. The interest is deductible, but remember that the earnings from your 
investments are ultimately taxable.)
All investments come with risk. If you prefer to put down just 20 percent and 
invest more money elsewhere, that’s fine. Just don’t keep the extra money (beyond 
an emergency reserve) under the mattress, in a savings account, or in bonds with 
a lower yield than your mortgage’s interest rate. Invest in stocks, real estate, or 
other growth investments. Otherwise, you don’t have a chance of earning a higher 
return than the cost of your mortgage; therefore, you’d be better off paying down 
your mortgage.
Doing lenders’ calculations
Mortgage lenders calculate the maximum amount that you can borrow to buy a 
home. All lenders want to gauge your ability to repay the money that you borrow, 
so you have to pass a few tests.
For a home in which you will live, lenders total your monthly housing expenses. 
They define your housing costs as
Mortgage payment + Property taxes + Insurance

CHAPTER 12  Seeking Shelter and Appreciation in Real Estate      157
Note: Lenders don’t consider maintenance and upkeep expenses (including utilities) 
in owning a home, but of course, you will incur these expenses as a homeowner.
Assessing consumer debt
Although lenders may not care where you spend money outside your home, they 
do care about your other debt. A lot of other debt, such as consumer debt on credit 
cards or auto loans, diminishes the funds that are available to pay your housing 
expenses. Lenders know that having other debt increases the possibility that you 
may fall behind or actually default on your mortgage payments.
If you have consumer debt that requires monthly payments, lenders calculate 
another ratio to determine the maximum that you can borrow for a home. Lenders 
add the amount you need to pay on your other consumer debt to your monthly 
housing expense.
Consumer debt is bad news, even without considering the fact that it hurts your 
qualification for a mortgage. Consumer debt is costly and encourages you to live 
beyond your means. Unlike the interest on mortgage debt, consumer debt interest 
isn’t tax-deductible.
Get rid of your consumer debt as soon as possible. Curtail your spending, and 
adjust to living within your means. If you can’t live within your means as a renter, 
you likely won’t be able to do it as a homeowner either.
Determining homeownership tax savings
Your mortgage interest and property taxes are generally tax-deductible on Form 
1040, Schedule A of your personal tax return. When you calculate the costs of 
owning a home, subtract the tax savings to get a more complete and accurate 
sense of what homeownership will cost you.
When you finally buy a home, refigure how much you need to pay in income tax, 
because your mortgage interest and property tax deductions can help lower your 
income tax bill. If you work for an employer, ask your payroll/benefits department 
for Form W-4. If you’re self-employed, you can complete a worksheet that comes 
with Form 1040-ES. (Call 800-829-3676 for a copy.) Many new home buyers don’t 
bother with this step, and they receive a big tax refund on their next filed income 
tax return. Although getting money back from the Internal Revenue Service may 
feel good, it means that at minimum, you gave the IRS an interest-free loan. In the 
worst-case scenario, the reduced cash flow during the year may cause you to accu-
mulate other debt or miss out on contributing to tax-deductible retirement accounts.
If you want a more precise estimate of how home ownership may affect your tax 
situation, get out your tax return, and plug in some reasonable numbers to guess-
timate how your taxes may change. You can also speak with a tax advisor.

158      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Down the road, also know that eligible homeowners can exclude a large portion of 
their gain on the sale of a principal residence from taxable income: up to $250,000 
for single taxpayers and up to $500,000 for married couples filing jointly.
Shopping for Your Home
Be realistic about how long it may take you to get up to speed about different areas 
and to find a home that meets your various desires. If you’re like most people, 
with a full-time job that allows only occasional evenings and weekends free to 
look for a house, three to six months is a short period to research and see possible 
areas in which to live, settle on an area and actually find and successfully negoti-
ate for a property. Six months to a year isn’t unusual or slow.
Remember that you’re talking about an enormous purchase that you’ll come home 
to daily. Buying a home can also involve a lot of compromise when you buy with 
other family members, particularly spouses.
Real estate agents can be a big barrier to taking your time with this monumental 
decision. Some agents are pushy; they just want to make a sale and get their com-
mission. Don’t work with such agents as a buyer, because they can make you 
stressed and broke. If necessary, begin your search without an agent to avoid this 
outside pressure.
In this section, I discuss your housing choices, how to research communities, and 
finally how to check out homes and value them.
Understanding your housing options
If you’re ready to buy a home, to help focus your search, you should make some 
decisions about what and where to buy. Here are the most common types of hous-
ing you will encounter:
»
» Single-family homes: If you grew up in the suburbs, you probably saw plenty 
of single-family homes, even if you didn’t live in one. This type of home is a 
detached house on a piece of land. Lots may be small or large, but the land is 
100 percent yours, and the house is separate from other neighboring 
properties.
»
» Condominiums: These properties typically are apartment-style units that are 
on top of and adjacent to one another. Many condo buildings were originally 
apartments that were converted to condos through the sale of ownership of 
separate units. When you purchase a condominium, you purchase a specific 

CHAPTER 12  Seeking Shelter and Appreciation in Real Estate      159
unit as well as a share of the common areas (the pool, landscaping, entry and 
hallways, laundry room, and so on).
»
» Townhomes: Townhomes are attached or row homes. A townhome is 
essentially a cross between a condominium (because it’s attached, sharing a 
roof and some walls) and a single-family house (because it has its own yard).
»
» Cooperatives: Cooperatives (or co-ops) resemble apartment and condomin-
ium buildings. When you buy a share in a cooperative, you own a share of the 
entire building, including some living space. Unlike in a condo, you generally 
need to get approval from the cooperative association if you want to remodel 
or rent your unit to a tenant. In some co-ops, you must even gain approval 
from the association to sell your unit to a proposed buyer.
Co-ops generally are much harder to obtain loans for and to sell, so I don’t 
recommend that you buy one unless you get a good deal and are certain you 
can obtain a loan.
With the exception of single-family homes in the preceding list, the other types of 
housing are shared housing. This type of housing generally gives you more living 
space for your dollars. This value makes sense, because a good chunk of the cost 
of a single-family home is the land on which the home sits. Land is good for 
decks, recreation, and children’s playgrounds, but you don’t live “in” land the 
way you do in your home. Shared housing maximizes living space for the housing 
dollars that you spend.
Another possible benefit of shared housing is that in many situations, you’re not 
personally responsible for general maintenance. Instead, the homeowners’ asso-
ciation (which you pay into) takes care of it. If you don’t have the time, energy, or 
desire to keep up a property, shared housing can make sense. Shared housing 
units may also give you access to recreation facilities, such as a pool, tennis courts, 
and exercise equipment.
From an investment perspective, shared housing isn’t best. Single-family homes 
generally appreciate more than shared housing does. Part of the reason for that is 
that shared housing is easier to build and to overbuild, and the greater supply 
tends to keep prices from rising as much. On the demand side, single-family 
homes tend to attract more potential buyers. Most folks, when they can afford it, 
prefer a stand-alone home, especially for the increased privacy.
If you can afford a smaller single-family home instead of a larger shared-housing 
unit and don’t balk at maintaining a home, buy a single-family home. Shared 
housing makes more sense for people who don’t want to deal with maintenance 
and who value the security of living in a larger building with other folks. (Recog-
nize that you may not like or even feel comfortable with everyone living in a given 
shared housing complex.) Shared-housing prices tend to hold up better in 

160      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
developed urban environments. If possible, avoid shared housing units in subur-
ban areas, where the availability of developable land makes building many more 
units possible, thus increasing the supply of housing and slowing growth in value.
Researching communities
You may have an idea about the type of property and location that interests you or 
that you think you can afford. Even if you’ve lived in an area for a while and think 
that you know it well, be sure to explore different types of properties in a variety 
of locations before you start to narrow your search.
Thinking that you can know what an area is like from anecdotes or from a small 
number of personal experiences can be a mistake. Anecdotes and people’s percep-
tions often aren’t accurate reflections of the facts. Check out the following key 
items in an area you’re considering:
»
» Amenities: Ideally, you don’t spend all your time at work, slaving away to 
make your monthly mortgage payment. I hope you have time to use parks, 
recreation facilities, and so on. Walk and drive around the neighborhoods 
you’re interested in to get a sense of these attractions. Most real estate agents 
enjoy showing their favorite neighborhoods. Talk to folks you know in the 
areas you’re considering. Visit those cities’ and towns’ websites.
»
» Catastrophic risks: Are the neighborhoods in which you’re considering 
buying a home prone to floods, tornadoes, mudslides, fires, or earthquakes? 
Although homeowner’s insurance, with proper supplements, can protect you 
financially, consider how you may deal with such catastrophes emotionally. 
Insurance addresses only the financial pain of a home loss. You can’t eliminate 
all risks, but you can get educated about catastrophic risks. The U.S. Geological 
Survey (www.usgs.gov) has maps that show earthquake risks, and the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (www.fema.gov) has flood-risk maps. 
Insurance companies and agencies can also tell you what they know about 
risks in particular areas.
»
» Crime: Cities and towns keep all sorts of crime statistics for neighborhoods, 
so use them! Call the local police department, or get local crime data online at 
sites like www.neighborhoodscout.com.
»
» Development: Check with the planning office in towns that you’re consider-
ing living in to find out what types of new developments and major renova-
tions are in the works. Planning people may also be aware of problems in 
particular areas.
»
» Property taxes: What will your property taxes be? Property tax rates vary 
from community to community. Check with the town’s assessment office or 
with a good real estate agent.

CHAPTER 12  Seeking Shelter and Appreciation in Real Estate      161
»
» Schools: If you have kids, you care about this issue a lot. Unfortunately, many 
people make snap judgments about school quality without getting the facts. 
Visit schools, talk to parents and teachers, and discover what goes on at the 
schools.
Consider school quality even if schools aren’t important to you, because they 
can affect the resale value of your property.
Checking out and valuing a home
Over many months, you may see dozens of homes for sale. Use these viewings as 
an opportunity to find out what specific homes are worth. Odds are that the listing 
price isn’t what a house is actually worth. Property that’s priced to sell usually 
does sell. Properties left on the market are often overpriced. The listing prices of 
such properties may reflect what an otherwise greedy or uninformed seller and 
his or her agent hope that some fool will pay.
Of the properties that you see, keep track of the prices they end up selling for. 
(Good agents can provide this information.) Properties usually sell for less than 
the listed price. Keeping track of selling prices gives you a good handle on what 
properties are really worth and a better sense of what you can afford.
After you set your sights on a home you like, thoroughly check out the surround-
ings. Go back to the neighborhood in which the property is located at different 
times of the day and on different days of the week. Knock on some doors, and 
meet your potential neighbors. Ask questions. Talk to property owners as well as 
renters. Because they don’t have a financial stake in the area, renters are often 
more forthcoming with negative information about an area.
After you decide where and what to buy, you’re ready to try to put a deal together. 
To do so, you need to understand mortgages, negotiations, and inspections. 
I cover these issues and many more in the latest edition of Home Buying Kit For 
Dummies (Wiley), which I cowrote with Ray Brown.
Investing in Investment Real Estate
If you’ve already bought your own home (and even if you haven’t), using real 
estate as an investment may interest you. Real estate investing, like the stock 
market and small-business investments, has long generated tremendous wealth 
for many investors.

162      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Real estate is like other types of ownership investments, such as stocks, in that 
you have an ownership stake in an asset. Although you have the potential for sig-
nificant profits, don’t forget that you also accept greater risk. Like stocks, real 
estate goes through good and bad performance periods. Most people who make 
money investing in real estate do so because they invest in and hold property over 
many years.
Real estate investing isn’t for everyone. You should avoid real estate investments 
that involve managing property if you’re pressed for time. Buying and owning 
investment property and being a landlord take a lot of time. If you fail to do your 
homework before purchasing real estate, you can end up overpaying — or buying 
a heap of trouble. You can hire a property manager to help with screening and 
finding good tenants, as well as troubleshooting problems with the building you 
purchase, but this step costs money and still requires some time involvement. 
Also, remember that most tenants don’t care for a property the same way that 
property owners do. If every little scratch or carpet stain sends your blood pres-
sure skyward, avoid the stress of being a landlord.
In this section, I discuss how to make wise real estate investments.
Understanding real estate  
investment’s appeal
Many people build their wealth by investing in real estate. Some people focus 
exclusively on property investments, but many others build their wealth through 
the companies they started or through other avenues and then diversify into real 
estate investments.
Real estate, like all investments, has its pros and cons. Investing in real estate is 
time-intensive and carries risks. Do it because you enjoy the challenge and because 
you want to diversify your portfolio. Don’t take this route because you seek a get- 
rich-quick outlet. Here are some of the reasons why people pursue real estate 
investments:
»
» Ability to add value: Perhaps you can fix up a property or develop it further 
and raise the rental income and resale value. Through legwork, persistence, 
and good negotiating skills, you may also be able to make money by purchas-
ing a property below its fair market value.
»
» Appreciation and income: You can make money from investment real estate 
through appreciation and from rental income in excess of your expenses. The 
appreciation of your properties compounds without taxation during your 
ownership. You don’t pay tax on this profit until you sell your property, and 

CHAPTER 12  Seeking Shelter and Appreciation in Real Estate      163
even then, you can roll over your gain into another investment property to 
avoid paying tax. The federal tax rate on gains from property held more  
than one year (known as long-term capital gains) are taxed a reduced rate —  
currently, a maximum of 20 percent (and possibly an additional 3.8 percent if 
you’re a high income earner subject to the Obamacare investment income 
surtax). You also seek to rent out your investment property at a profit based 
on the property’s rental income in excess of its expenses (mortgage, property 
taxes, insurance, maintenance, and so on). Over time, your operating profit, 
which is subject to ordinary income tax, should rise as you increase your 
rental prices faster than your expenses.
»
» Leverage: Real estate is different from most other investments because you 
can generally borrow up to 75 percent of the value of the property to buy it. 
Thus, you can use your down payment of 25 percent of the purchase price to 
buy, own, and control a much larger investment; this concept is called leverage. 
You hope, of course, that the value of your real estate goes up; if it does, you 
make money on your original dollars invested as well as on the money that 
you borrowed. Leverage can also work against you when prices decline.
»
» Limited land: There’s a limited supply of buildable, desirable land, and as the 
population grows, demand for land and housing continues to grow. Land and 
what you can do with it are what make real estate valuable.
»
» Longer-term focus: One problem with investing in the stock market is that 
prices are constantly changing. Because all you need to do is tap your phone 
app, click your computer mouse, or call a toll-free phone number to place 
your sell or buy order, some stock market investors fall prey to irrational snap 
judgments. While the real estate market is constantly changing, short-term, 
day-to-day, and week-to-week changes are invisible (although some real 
estate–pricing websites are calculating updated prices, of questionable 
accuracy, more often). If prices do decline over months and years, you’re 
much less likely to sell real estate in a panic. Preparing a property for sale and 
eventually getting it sold take a good deal of time, and this barrier to selling 
quickly helps you keep your perspective.
Sizing up real estate investment options
If you think you’re cut out to be a landlord and are ready for the responsibility of 
buying, owning, and managing rental real estate, you have numerous real estate 
investment options to choose among.
Some investors prefer to buy properties, improve them, and then move on.  
Ideally, however, you should plan to make real estate investments that you hold 
for many years, perhaps into your retirement years. But what should you buy? 
Following is my take on various real estate investments.

164      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Real estate investment trusts
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are entities that generally invest in different 
types of property, such as shopping centers, apartments, and other rental build-
ings. For a fee, REIT managers identify and negotiate the purchase of properties 
that they believe are good investments; then they manage these properties, 
including handling all tenant relations.
REITs are a good way to invest in real estate if you don’t want the hassles and 
headaches that come with directly owning and managing rental property. You can 
research and purchase shares in individual REITs, which trade as securities on the 
major stock exchanges. An even better approach is to buy a mutual fund or 
exchange-traded fund that invests in a diversified mixture of REITs.
Residential housing
If you’re willing to be a landlord, your best bet for real estate investing is to pur-
chase residential property. People always need places to live. Residential housing 
is easier to understand, purchase, and manage than most other types of property, 
such as office and retail property. If you’re a homeowner, you already have expe-
rience locating, purchasing, and maintaining residential property.
The most common residential housing options are single-family homes, condo-
miniums, and townhouses. You can also purchase multiunit buildings. Consider 
the following issues when you decide what type of property to buy:
»
» Appreciation potential: Look for property where simple cosmetic and other 
fixes may allow you to increase rents and increase the market value of the 
property. Although condos may be easier to maintain, they tend to appreciate 
less than homes or apartment buildings do, unless the condos are located in a 
desirable urban area.
»
» Cash flow: The difference between the rental income that you collect and the 
expenses that you pay out is known as your cash flow. As time goes on, generat-
ing a positive cash flow usually gets easier as you pay down your mortgage debt 
and increase rents.
»
» Maintenance: Condominiums are generally the lowest-maintenance proper-
ties because most condominium associations deal with issues such as roofing, 
landscaping, and so on for the entire building. Note that as the owner, you’re 
still responsible for maintenance that’s needed inside your unit, such as 
servicing appliances, interior painting, and so on. Be aware, though, that some 
condo complexes don’t allow rentals. With a single-family home or apartment 
building, you’re responsible for all the maintenance. You can hire someone to 
do the work, but you still have to find the contractors and coordinate, oversee, 
and pay for the work they do.

CHAPTER 12  Seeking Shelter and Appreciation in Real Estate      165
»
» Tenants: Single-family homes with just one tenant (which could be a family, a 
couple, or a single person) are simpler to deal with than a multiunit apartment 
building that requires the management and maintenance of multiple renters 
and units.
Unless you really want to minimize maintenance responsibilities, avoid condo-
minium investments. Similarly, apartment-building investments are best left to 
sophisticated investors who like a challenge and can manage more complex prop-
erties. Single-family home investments are generally more straightforward for 
most people. Be sure you run the numbers on your rental income and expenses to 
see whether you can afford the negative cash flow that often occurs in the early 
years of ownership.
Land
If having tenants and maintaining a building is a lot of work, you can consider 
investing in land. Over time, in areas experiencing economic and building growth 
and using up available land, land values appreciate well.
Although land doesn’t require upkeep and tenants, it does require financial feed-
ing. Investing in land can be problematic for the following reasons:
»
» Identifying many years in advance which communities will experience 
rapid population and job growth isn’t easy. Land in those areas that people 
believe will be the next hot spot often already sells at a premium. If property 
growth doesn’t happen, appreciation will dry up.
»
» Investing in land is a cash drain. Because it costs money to purchase land, 
you also have a mortgage payment to make. Mortgage lenders charge higher 
interest rates on loans to purchase land because they see it as a more 
speculative investment.
»
» You don’t get depreciation tax write-offs because land isn’t depreciable. 
You also have property tax payments to meet, as well as other expenses. With 
land investments, you don’t receive income from the property to offset these 
expenses.
»
» If you someday decide that you want to develop the property, it can cost 
a great deal of money. Obtaining a loan for development is challenging and 
more expensive (because it’s riskier for the lender) than obtaining a loan for a 
developed property.
If you decide to invest in land, be sure you meet the following criteria:
»
» You can afford it. Tally up the annual carrying costs so you can see what your 
cash drain may be. What are the financial consequences of this cash outflow? 

166      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Will you be able to fund your tax-advantaged retirement accounts, for example? 
If you can’t, count the lost tax benefits as another cost of owning land.
»
» You understand what further improvements the land needs. Running 
utility lines, building roads, landscaping, and so on all cost money. If you plan to 
develop and build on the land you purchase, research what these things may 
cost. Remember that improvements almost always cost more than you expect.
»
» You know its zoning status. The value of land depends greatly on what you 
can develop on it, so thoroughly understand the land’s zoning status and what 
you can — and can’t — build on it before you buy. Also research the disposi-
tion of the planning department and nearby communities. Areas that are 
antigrowth and antidevelopment are less likely to be good places for you to 
invest in land, especially if you need permission to do the type of project you 
have in mind.
Be aware that zoning can change for the worse. Sometimes a zoning altera-
tion can reduce what you can develop on a property and, consequently, the 
property’s value.
»
» You’ve researched the local economic and housing situations. Buy land in 
an area that’s home to rapidly expanding companies and that has a shortage 
of housing and developable land.
Commercial real estate
If you’re really motivated and willing to roll up your sleeves, you may want to 
consider commercial real estate investments (such as small office buildings or 
strip malls). Generally, however, you’re better off not investing in such real estate, 
because it’s much more complicated than investing in residential real estate. It’s 
also riskier from an investment and tenant-turnover perspective. When tenants 
move out, new tenants sometimes require extensive and costly improvements to 
the space they want to rent.
In addition to considering investing in commercial real estate when your analysis of 
the local market suggests that it’s a good time to buy, consider it when you can use 
some of the space to run your own small business. Just as owning your home can be 
more cost-effective than renting over the years, so is owning commercial real estate 
if you buy at a reasonably good time and hold the property for many years.
So how do you evaluate the state of your local commercial real estate market? 
Examine the supply-and-demand statistics over recent years. Determine how 
much space is available for rent and how that number has changed over time. Also 
discover the vacancy rate and find out how it has changed in recent years. Finally, 
investigate the rental rates, usually quoted as a price per square foot. Ask your 
local commercial property real estate agent for this data or for the local sources 
where you can find it.

CHAPTER 12  Seeking Shelter and Appreciation in Real Estate      167
Here’s one way to tell that purchasing a commercial property in a certain area is a 
bad idea: The supply of available space has increased faster than demand, leading 
to falling rental rates and higher vacancies. A slowing local economy and an 
increasing unemployment rate also spell trouble for commercial real estate prices. 
Each market is different, so make sure you check out the details of your area.
Conducting real estate investing research
In the following sections, I explain what to look for in a community and area 
where you seek to invest in real estate. Investing in real estate closer to home is 
best because you’re probably more familiar with the local area, allowing you to 
have an easier time researching and managing the properties.
Assessing employment vitality
Invest in real estate in communities that maintain diverse job bases. If the local 
economy relies heavily on jobs in a small number of industries, that dependence 
increases the risk of your real estate investments. The Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(www.bls.gov) compiles this type of data for metropolitan areas and counties.
Also determine which industries are most heavily represented in the local econ-
omy. Areas that have a greater concentration of high-growth and higher-paying 
industries stand a greater chance of faster price appreciation.
Finally, check out the unemployment situation, and examine how the jobless rate 
has changed in recent years. Good signs to look for are declining unemployment 
and increasing job growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also tracks this data.
Evaluating the realty market’s health
The price of real estate, like the price of anything else, is driven by supply and 
demand. The smaller the supply and the greater the demand, the higher prices 
climb. An abundance of land and available credit, however, inevitably leads to 
overbuilding. When the supply of anything expands at a much faster rate than 
demand, prices usually fall.
Upward pressure on real estate prices tends to be greatest in areas with little 
buildable land. In addition to buildable land, consider these important real estate 
market indicators to gauge the health of a particular market:
»
» Building permits: The trend in the number of building permits tells you how 
the supply of real estate properties may soon change. A long and sustained 
rise in permits over several years can indicate that the supply of new property 
may dampen future price appreciation.

168      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
»
» Vacancy rates: If few rentals are vacant, you can assume that the area has 
more competition and demand for existing units, which bodes well for future 
real estate price appreciation. Conversely, high vacancy rates indicate an 
excess supply of real estate, which may put downward pressure on rental 
rates as many landlords compete to attract tenants.
»
» Listings of property for sale and number of sales: Just as the construction of 
many new buildings is bad for future real estate price appreciation, increasing 
numbers of property listings are an indication of potential trouble. A sign of a 
healthy real estate market is a decreasing and relatively low level of property 
listings, indicating that the demand from buyers meets or exceeds the supply 
of property for sale from sellers. When the cost of buying is relatively low 
compared with the cost of renting, more renters can afford and choose to 
purchase, thus increasing the number of sales.
»
» Rental rates: The trend in rental rates that renters are willing and able to 
pay over the years is a good indication of the demand for housing. When the 
demand for housing keeps up with the supply of housing and the local econ-
omy continues to grow, rents generally increase. This increase is a positive sign 
for continued real estate price appreciation. Beware of buying rental property 
that’s subject to rent control; the property’s expenses may rise faster than you 
can raise the rents.
Valuing property and financial projections
Crunching some numbers to figure what revenue and expenses a rental property 
may have is one of the most important exercises that you can go through 
when determining a property’s worth and making an offer. Here are some key 
things to do: 
»
» Estimate cash flow. Cash flow is the difference between the money that a 
property brings in and what goes out for its expenses.
»
» Value property. Estimating a property’s cash flow is an important first step in 
figuring a property’s value, but a building’s cash flow doesn’t provide enough 
information for you to decide intelligently whether to buy a particular real 
estate investment. Property valuations are most often done by appraisers, 
who value property for a living, or real estate agents, who can do an analysis 
of comparable property sales.

Financing and Putting 
Together Real Estate 
Investments
I
n this chapter, I discuss issues such as understanding and selecting mortgages, 
working with real estate agents, negotiating, and other important details that 
help you put a real estate deal together. I also provide some words of wisdom 
about taxes and selling your property that may come in handy down the road.
Financing Your Real Estate Deals
Unless you’re affluent or buying a low-cost property, you likely need to borrow 
some money via a mortgage to make the purchase happen. Without financing, 
your dream to invest in real estate remains just that: a dream. So first you have to 
maximize your chances of getting approved for a loan. Shopping wisely for a good 
mortgage can save you thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, of dollars in 
interest and fees. Don’t get saddled with a loan that you may not be able to afford 
someday and that could push you into foreclosure or bankruptcy.

170      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Achieving loan approval
Even if you have perfect or near-perfect credit, you may encounter financing 
problems with some properties. And, of course, not all real estate buyers have a 
perfect credit history, tons of available cash, and no debt. Because of the soft real 
estate market in the late 2000s and the jump in foreclosures since that time, lend-
ers tightened credit standards to avoid making loans to people likely to default. If 
you’re one of those borrowers who end up jumping through more hoops than oth-
ers to get a loan, don’t give up hope. Few borrowers are perfect from a lender’s 
perspective, and many problems are fixable.
To head off some potential rejections before you apply for a loan, disclose to your 
lender anything that may cause a problem. For example, if you already know that 
your credit report indicates some late payments from when you were out of the 
country for several weeks five years ago, write a letter that explains this situation.
Fixing down payment blues
Many people, especially when they make their first real estate purchase, are 
strapped for cash. In order to qualify for the most attractive financing, lenders 
typically require that your down payment be at least 20 percent of the property’s 
purchase price. Investment property loans may require 25 to 30 percent down for 
the best terms. In addition, you need reserve money to pay for other closing costs, 
such as title insurance and loan fees.
If you don’t have 20-plus percent of a property’s purchase price available, don’t 
despair. You can still own real estate with the following strategies:
»
» Take out private mortgage insurance. Some lenders may offer you a 
mortgage even though you can put down only, say, 10 percent of the pur-
chase price. These lenders will likely require you to purchase private mortgage 
insurance (PMI) for your loan, however. This insurance generally costs a few 
hundred dollars per year and protects the lender if you default on your loan. 
When you have at least 20 percent equity in the property, you can generally 
eliminate the PMI.
»
» Dip into your retirement savings. You may be able to borrow against your 
retirement account balance through your employer’s retirement savings plan 
under the condition that you repay the loan within a set number of years. 
Subject to eligibility requirements, first-time homebuyers can make penalty-
free withdrawals of up to $10,000 from IRA accounts. (Note: You still must pay 
regular income tax on the withdrawal.)
»
» Postpone your purchase. If you don’t want the cost and strain of extra fees 
and bad mortgage terms, you can postpone your purchase. Go on a financial 
austerity program and boost your savings further.

CHAPTER 13  Financing and Putting Together Real Estate Investments      171
»
» Consider lower-priced properties. Lower-priced properties can help keep 
down the purchase price and the required down payment.

» Find a partner. Sharing the financial load with a partner often makes buying 
real estate easier. Just make sure you write up a legal contract to specify what 
happens if a partner wants out. Family members sometimes make good 
partners. Your parents, grandparents, and even your siblings may have some 
extra cash they’d like to loan, invest, or give to you as a gift!
»
» Look into seller financing. Some property owners or developers may 
finance your purchase with as little as 5 to 10 percent down. However, you 
can’t be as picky about such seller-financed properties because a limited 
supply is available. Many that are available need work or haven’t yet sold for 
other reasons.
Boosting your credit score
Late payments, missed payments, or debts that you never bothered to pay can 
tarnish your credit report and squelch a lender’s desire to offer you a mortgage. If 
you’re turned down for a loan because of your less-than-stellar credit history, 
find out the details of why by requesting (at no charge to you) a copy of your credit 
report from the lender that turned down your loan.
If you think your credit history may be a problem as you’re looking for a loan, the 
first thing to do is get the facts. By law, you’re entitled to one free credit report per 
year from each of the three consumer credit reporting companies  — Equifax, 
Experian, and TransUnion. You can get all three reports at once or space them out 
throughout the year (checking in on one each at four-month intervals). The 
­companies have set up one central website where you can access these reports 
(www.annualcreditreport.com), or you can call toll-free at 877-322-8228. Just 
be careful not to buy the ongoing credit monitoring services these companies will 
pitch you.
If you do find credit report problems, explain them to your lender. If the lender is 
unsympathetic, try calling other lenders. Tell them your credit problems up-front 
and see whether you can find one willing to offer you a loan. Mortgage brokers 
may also be able to help you shop for lenders in these cases. (I discuss working 
with mortgage brokers later in this chapter.)
Sometimes you may feel that you’re not in control when you apply for a loan. In 
reality, however, you can fix a number of credit problems yourself, and you reap 
great rewards (access to better loan terms, including lower interest rates) for 
doing so. And you can often explain those that you can’t fix. Remember that some 
lenders are more lenient and flexible than others. Just because one mortgage 
lender rejects your loan application doesn’t mean all the others will as well.

172      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
If you discover erroneous information on your credit report, get on the phone to 
the credit bureaus and start squawking. If specific creditors are the culprits, call 
them, too. Keep notes from your conversations and make sure you put your case 
in writing and add your comments to your credit report. If the customer service 
representatives you talk with are no help, send a letter to the president of each 
company. Let the head honcho know that his or her organization caused you prob-
lems in obtaining credit. For more information on examining and disputing items 
on your credit report and managing credit in general, check out the Federal Trade 
Commission’s website at www.ftc.gov/credit.
Besides late or missed payments, another common credit problem is having too 
much consumer debt at the time you apply for a mortgage. The more consumer 
debt you rack up (including credit card and auto loan debt), the less mortgage 
credit you qualify for. If you’re turned down for a mortgage, consider it a wake-up 
call to get rid of your high-cost debt. Hang on to the dream of buying real estate 
and plug away at paying off your debts before you attempt another foray into real 
estate.

see the latest edition of my book Personal Finance For Dummies (Wiley).
Addressing a low appraisal
Even if you have sufficient income, a clean credit report, and an adequate down 
payment, a lender may deny your loan if the appraisal of the property that you 
want to buy comes in lower than you agreed to pay for the property.
If you still like the property, renegotiate a lower price with the seller by using the 
low appraisal to strengthen your case. You need to follow a different path should 
you encounter a low appraisal on a property that you already own and are refi-
nancing. If you have the cash available, you can simply put more money down to 
get the loan balance to a level for which you qualify. If you don’t have the cash, 
you may need to try another lender or forgo the refinance until you save more 
money or until the property value rises. (I discuss refinancing in more detail later 
in this chapter.)
Handling insufficient income
If you’re self-employed or have changed jobs, your current income may not 
resemble your past income or, more importantly, your income may be below what 
a mortgage lender likes to see given the amount that you want to borrow. A way 
around this problem, although challenging, is to make a larger down payment.

CHAPTER 13  Financing and Putting Together Real Estate Investments      173
If you can’t make a large down payment, another option is to get a co-signer for 
the loan. For example, your relatives may be willing to sign with you. As long as 
they aren’t overextended themselves, they may be able to help you qualify for a 
larger loan than you can get on your own. As with partnerships, put your agree-
ment in writing so no misunderstandings occur.
Debating fixed-rate versus  
adjustable-rate mortgages
Two major types of mortgages exist: those with a fixed interest rate and those 
with an adjustable rate. Your choice depends on your financial situation, how 
much risk you’re willing to accept, and the type of property you want to purchase. 
For example, obtaining a fixed-rate loan on a property that lenders perceive as a 
riskier investment is more difficult than getting an adjustable-rate mortgage for 
the same property.
Understanding fixed-rate mortgages
Fixed-rate mortgages, which are typically for a 15- or 30-year term, have interest 
rates that stay fixed or level — you lock in an interest rate that doesn’t change 
over the life of your loan. Because the interest rate stays the same, your monthly 
mortgage payment stays the same. You have nothing complicated to track and no 
uncertainty. Fixed-rate loans give people peace of mind and payment stability.
Fixed-rate mortgages do, however, carry risks. If interest rates fall significantly 
after you obtain your mortgage and you’re unable to refinance, you face being 
stuck with a higher-cost mortgage, which could be problematic if you lose your 
job or the value of your property decreases. (This scenario — declining interest 
rates and falling real estate values — happened to plenty of people in the late 
2000s.) Even if you’re able to refinance, you’ll probably have to spend significant 
time and money to complete the paperwork.
Analyzing adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
In contrast to a fixed-rate mortgage, an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) carries an 
interest rate that varies over time (based on a formula the lender establishes). 
Such a mortgage begins with one interest rate, and you may pay different rates for 
every year, possibly even every month, that you hold the loan. Thus, the size of 
your monthly payment fluctuates. Because a mortgage payment makes a large 
dent in most property owners’ bank accounts, signing up for an ARM without fully 
understanding it is fiscally foolish.

174      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
The advantage of an ARM is that if you purchase your property during a period of 
higher interest rates, you can start paying your mortgage with a relatively low 
initial interest rate, compared with fixed-rate loans. (With a fixed-rate mortgage, 
a mortgage lender takes extra risk in committing to a fixed interest rate for 15 to 
30 years. To be compensated for accepting this additional risk, lenders charge a 
premium with fixed-rate mortgages in case interest rates, which they have to pay 
on their source of funds in the form of deposits, move much higher in future 
years.) If interest rates decline, an ARM allows you to capture many of the benefits 
of lower rates without the cost and hassle of refinancing.
Deciding between fixed and  
adjustable mortgages
You can’t predict the future course of interest rates. Even the professional finan-
cial market soothsayers and investors can’t predict where rates are heading. If you 
BEWARE OF BALLOON LOANS
Balloon loans generally start the way traditional fixed-rate mortgages start. You make 
level payments based on a long-term payment schedule — over 15 or 30 years, for 
example. But at a predetermined time, usually within ten years of the loan’s inception, 
the remaining loan balance becomes fully due.
Balloon loans may save you money because they have a lower interest rate than a 
­longer-term fixed-rate mortgage and you pay that interest over a shorter period of time. 
However, balloon loans are dangerous; your financial situation can change, and you 
may not be able to refinance when your balloon loan is due. What if you lose your job 
or your income drops? What if the value of your property drops and the appraisal 
comes in too low to qualify you for a new loan? What if interest rates rise and you 
can’t qualify at the higher rate on a new loan? You’re still going to have to pay off your 
balloon loan when it comes due.
Sometimes, balloon loans may be the only option for the buyer (or so the buyer thinks). 
Buyers are more commonly backed into these loans during periods of high interest 
rates. When a buyer can’t afford the payments on a conventional mortgage and really 
wants a particular property, a seller may offer a balloon loan.
Warning: Shun balloon loans. Consider a balloon loan if, and only if, such a loan is your 
only financing option, you’ve really done your homework to exhaust other financing 
alternatives, and you’re certain you can refinance when the balloon comes due. If you 
take a balloon loan, get one with as much time as possible, preferably ten years, before 
it becomes due.

CHAPTER 13  Financing and Putting Together Real Estate Investments      175
could foretell interest rate movements, you could make a fortune investing in 
bonds and interest-rate futures and options. So cast aside your crystal ball and ask 
yourself the following two vital questions to decide whether a fixed or adjustable 
mortgage will work best for you.
What financial risks can you handle?
How much of a gamble can you take with the size of your monthly mortgage pay-
ment? For example, if your job and income are unstable and you need to borrow 
an amount that stretches your monthly budget, you can’t afford much risk. If 
you’re in this situation, stick with fixed-rate mortgages because you likely won’t 
be able to handle a large increase in interest rates and the payment on an ARM.
If, on the other hand, you’re in a position to take the financial risks that come with 
an adjustable-rate mortgage, you have a better chance of saving money with an 
adjustable loan rather than a fixed-rate loan. Your interest rate starts lower and 
stays lower if the market level of interest rates remains unchanged. Even if rates 
go up, they’ll likely come back down over the life of your loan. If you can stick with 
your adjustable-rate loan for better and for worse, you may come out ahead in the 
long run.
Adjustables also make more sense if you borrow less than you’re qualified for. Or 
perhaps you regularly save a sizable chunk — more than 10 percent — of your 
monthly income. If your income significantly exceeds your spending, you may feel 
less anxiety about fluctuating interest rates. If you do choose an adjustable loan, 
you may be more financially secure if you have a hefty financial cushion (at least 
six months’ to as much as a year’s worth of expenses reserved) that you can 
access if rates go up.
Almost all adjustables limit, or cap, the rise in the interest rate that your loan 
allows. Typical caps are 2 percent per year and 6 percent over the life of the loan. 
Ask your lender to calculate the highest possible monthly payment that your loan 
allows. The number that the lender comes up with is the lifetime cap, the payment 
you face if the interest rate on your loan goes to the highest level allowed. If you 
can’t afford the highest-allowed payment on an adjustable-rate mortgage, don’t 
take one. You shouldn’t take the chance that the rate won’t rise that high — it can, 
and you could lose the property.
Don’t take an adjustable mortgage just because the lower initial interest rates 
allow you to afford the property that you want to buy (unless you’re absolutely 
certain your income will rise to meet future payment increases). Instead, set your 
sights on a property that you can afford to buy with a fixed-rate mortgage.

176      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
How long do you anticipate keeping the mortgage?
Saving interest on most adjustables is usually a certainty in the first two or three 
years. By nature, an adjustable-rate mortgage starts at a lower interest rate than 
a fixed-rate mortgage. However, if rates rise while you hold an ARM, you can end 
up giving back the savings that you achieve in the early years of the mortgage.
If you aren’t going to keep your mortgage for more than five to seven years, you’ll 
probably end up paying more interest to carry a fixed-rate mortgage. Also con-
sider a hybrid loan, which combines features of fixed- and adjustable-rate mort-
gages. For example, the initial rate may hold constant for several years and then 
adjust once a year or every six months thereafter. Such loans may make sense for 
you if you foresee a high probability of keeping your loan seven years or less but 
want some stability in your monthly payments. The longer the initial rate stays 
locked in, the higher the interest rate.
Finding your best fixed-rate mortgage
You may think that comparing one fixed-rate loan to another is simple because 
the interest rate on a fixed-rate loan is the rate you pay every month over the 
entire life of the loan. And as with your golf score and the number of times that 
your boss catches you showing up late for work, a lower number (or interest rate) 
is better, right?
Unfortunately, banks generally charge an up-front interest fee, known as points, 
in addition to the ongoing interest over the life of the loan. Points are actually 
percentages: One point is equal to 1 percent of the loan amount. So when a lender 
tells you a quoted loan has 1.5 points, you pay 1.5 percent of the amount you bor-
row as points. On a $100,000 loan, for example, 1.5 points cost you $1,500. The 
interest rate on a fixed-rate loan must always be quoted with the points on the 
loan, if the loan has points.
You may want to take a higher interest rate on your mortgage if you don’t have 
enough cash to pay for a lot of points, which you pay up-front when you close the 
loan. On the other hand, if you’re willing and able to pay more points, you can 
lower your interest rate. You may want to pay more points because the interest 
rate on your loan determines your payments over a long period of time — 15 to 
30 years.
Suppose one lender quotes you a rate of 5.75 percent on a 30-year fixed-rate loan 
and charges one point (1 percent). Another lender, which quotes 6 percent for 
30 years, doesn’t charge any points. Which is better? The answer depends on how 
long you plan to keep the loan.

CHAPTER 13  Financing and Putting Together Real Estate Investments      177
The 5.75 percent loan is 0.25 percent less than the 6 percent loan. However, it 
takes you about four years to earn back the savings to cover the cost of that point 
because you have to pay 1 percent (one point) up-front on the 5.75 percent loan. 
So if you expect to keep the loan more than four years, go with the 5.75 percent 
option. If you plan to keep the loan less than four years, go with the 6 percent 
option.
To make it easier to perform an apples-to-apples comparison of mortgages from 
different lenders, get interest rate quotes at the same point level. For example, ask 
each lender for the interest rate on a loan for which you pay one point. And 
remember that if a loan has no points, it’s sure to have a higher interest rate. I’m 
not saying that no-point loans are better or worse than comparable loans from 
other lenders. Just don’t get sucked into a loan because of a no-points sales pitch. 
Lenders who spend big bucks on advertising these types of loans rarely have the 
best mortgage terms.
All things being equal, no-point loans make more sense for refinances because 
points aren’t immediately tax-deductible as they are on purchases. (You can 
deduct the points that you pay on a refinance only over the life of the mortgage.) 
On a mortgage for a property that you’re purchasing, a no-point loan may help if 
you’re cash poor at closing.
Consider a no-point loan if you can’t afford more out-of-pocket expenditures 
now or if you think you’ll keep the loan only a few years. Shop around and com-
pare different lenders’ no-point loans.
Landing an appropriate adjustable-rate 
mortgage
Selecting an ARM has a lot in common with selecting a home to buy. You need to 
make trade-offs and compromises. In the following sections, I explain the numer-
ous features and options — caps, indexes, margins, and adjustment periods — 
that you find with ARMs. (These aren’t issues with fixed-rate loans.)
Understanding the start rate
Just as the name implies, your start rate is the rate that your adjustable mortgage 
begins with. Think of the start rate as a teaser rate — the initial rate on ARMs is 
often set artificially low to entice you. Don’t judge an ARM by this rate alone. You 
won’t pay this attractively low rate for long. With ARMs, interest rates generally 
rise as soon as the terms of the mortgage allow. Even if the market level of interest 
rates doesn’t change, your adjustable rate is destined to increase. An increase of 
1 or 2 percentage points is common.

178      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
The formula for determining the rate caps and the future interest rates on an 
adjustable-rate mortgage (see the next section) are far more important in deter-
mining what a mortgage will cost you in the long run. For more on rate caps, see 
the section “Analyzing adjustments” later in this chapter.
Assessing your future interest rate
The first thing you need to ask a mortgage lender or broker about an adjustable 
rate is the exact formula it uses for determining the future interest rate on your 
particular loan. You need to know how a lender figures your interest rate changes 
over the life of your loan. All adjustables are based on the following general for-
mula, which specifies how the interest rate is set on your loan in the future:
Index
Margin
Interest rate
The index determines the base level of interest rates that the mortgage contract 
specifies in order to calculate the specific interest rate for your loan. Indexes are 
generally (but not always) widely quoted in the financial press.
For example, suppose that the current index value for a given loan is equal to the 
6-month Treasury bill index, which is, say, 2 percent. The margin is the amount 
added to the index to determine the interest rate that you pay on your mortgage. 
Most loans have margins of around 2.5 percent. Thus, the rate of a mortgage 
driven by the following formula
6-month Treasury bill rate
2.5 percent
is set at 2
2 5
4 5
.
.  percent. This figure is known as the fully indexed rate. If the 
advertised start rate for this loan is just 3 percent, you know that if the 
index (6-month Treasuries) stays at the same level, your loan will increase to 
4.5 percent.
Compare the fully indexed rate to the current rate for fixed-rate loans. During 
particular time periods, you may be surprised to discover that the fixed-rate loan 
is at about the same interest rate or even a tad lower. This insight may cause you 
to reconsider your choice of an adjustable-rate loan, which can, of course, rise to 
an even higher rate in the future.
Making sense of common ARM indexes
The different indexes vary mainly in how rapidly they respond to changes in 
interest rates. Some common indexes include the following:
»
» Treasury bills: Treasury bills, which are often referred to as T-bills, are IOUs 
(bonds) that the U.S. government issues. Most adjustables are tied to the 
interest rate on 6-month or 12-month T-bills. T-bill interest rates move 
relatively quickly.

CHAPTER 13  Financing and Putting Together Real Estate Investments      179
»
» Certificates of deposit: Certificates of deposit, or CDs, are interest-bearing 
bank investments that lock you in for a specific period of time. ARMs are 
usually tied to the average interest rate that banks are currently paying on 
6-month CDs. Like T-bills, CDs tend to respond quickly to changes in the 
market’s level of interest rates.
»
» London Interbank Offered Rate Index (LIBOR): This index is an average of 
the interest rates that major international banks charge one another to borrow 
U.S. dollars in the London money market. Like the U.S. Treasury and CD 
indexes, LIBOR tends to move and adjust quickly to changes in interest rates.
If you select an adjustable-rate mortgage that’s tied to one of the faster-moving 
indexes, you take on more of a risk that the next adjustment will reflect interest 
rate increases. Because you take on this risk, lenders cut you breaks in other ways, 
such as through lower caps or points. If you want the security of an ARM tied to a 
slower-moving index, you pay for that security in one form or another, such as 
through a higher start rate, caps, margin, or points.
Trying to predict interest rates is risky business. When selecting a mortgage, 
keeping sight of your financial situation is far more important than trying to 
guess future interest rates.
Analyzing adjustments
After the initial interest rate expires, the interest rate on an ARM fluctuates based 
on the loan formula that I discuss earlier in the chapter. Most ARMs adjust every 
6 or 12 months, but some adjust as frequently as monthly. In advance of each 
adjustment, the lender sends you a notice telling you your new rate.
All things being equal, the less frequently your loan adjusts, the less financial 
uncertainty you have in your life. However, less-frequent adjustments usually 
have a higher starting interest rate.
Almost all adjustables come with an adjustment cap, which limits the maximum 
rate change (up or down) at each adjustment. On most loans that adjust every 
6 months, the adjustment cap is 1 percent. In other words, the interest rate that 
the loan charges can move up or down no more than one percentage point in a 
given adjustment period.
Loans that adjust more than once per year usually limit the maximum rate change 
that’s allowed over the entire year as well. On the vast majority of such loans, 
2  percent is the annual rate cap. Likewise, almost all adjustables come with  
lifetime caps. These caps limit the highest rate allowed over the entire life of the 
loan. Adjustable loans commonly have lifetime caps 5 to 6 percent higher than the 
initial start rate.

180      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Never take an ARM without rate caps! Doing so is worse than giving a credit card 
with an unlimited line of credit to your teenager for the weekend. (At least you get 
the credit card back on Monday!) When you want to take an ARM, you must iden-
tify the maximum payment that you can handle. If you can’t handle the highest 
allowed payment, don’t look at ARMs.
Avoiding negative amortization ARMs
As you make mortgage payments over time, the loan balance you still owe is 
­gradually reduced, or amortized. Negative amortization — increasing your loan 
­balance — is the reverse of this process. Some ARMs allow negative amortization. 
How can your outstanding loan balance grow when you continue to make mort-
gage payments? This phenomenon occurs when your mortgage payment is less 
than it really should be.
Some loans cap the increase of your monthly payment but don’t cap the interest 
rate. Thus, the size of your mortgage payment may not reflect all the interest you 
owe on your loan. So rather than paying the interest you owe and paying off some 
of your loan balance (or principal) every month, you end up paying off some, but 
not all, of the interest you owe. Thus, lenders add the extra, unpaid interest you 
still owe to your outstanding debt.
Negative amortization resembles paying only the minimum payment that your 
credit card bill requires. You continue to rack up finance charges (in this case, 
greater interest) on the balance as long as you make only the artificially low 
­payment. Taking a loan with negative amortization defeats the whole purpose of 
borrowing an amount that fits your overall financial goals.
Avoid adjustables with negative amortization. Most lenders and mortgage brokers 
aren’t forthcoming about telling you, so the only way to know whether a loan 
includes negative amortization is to explicitly ask. You find negative amortization 
more frequently on loans that lenders consider risky. If you have trouble finding 
lenders that will deal with your financial situation, make sure you’re especially 
careful.
Understanding other mortgage fees
In addition to points and the ongoing interest rate, lenders tack on all sorts of 
other up-front charges when processing your loan. Get an itemization of these 
other fees and charges in writing from all lenders that you’re seriously consider-
ing. (I explain how to find the best lenders for your needs in the next section.) You 
need to know the total of all lender fees so you can accurately compare different 
lenders’ loans and determine how much closing on your loan will cost you. These 
other mortgage fees can pile up in a hurry. Here are the common ones you may see:

CHAPTER 13  Financing and Putting Together Real Estate Investments      181
»
» Application and processing fees: Most lenders charge a few hundred dollars 
to work with you to complete your paperwork and funnel it through their loan 
evaluation process. If your loan is rejected, or if it’s approved and you decide 
not to take it, the lender needs to cover its costs. Some lenders return this fee 
to you upon closing with their loan.
»
» Credit report charge: Most lenders charge you for the cost of obtaining your 
credit report, which tells the lender whether you’ve repaid other loans on 
time. Credit report fees typically run about $75.
»
» Appraisal fee: The property for which you borrow money needs to be valued. 
If you default on your mortgage, a lender doesn’t want to get stuck with a 
property that’s worth less than you owe. The cost for an appraisal typically 
ranges from several hundred dollars for most residential properties to as 
much as $1,000 or more for larger investment properties.
Some lenders offer loans without points or other lender charges. However, 
remember that if they don’t charge points or other fees, they charge a higher 
interest rate on your loan to make up the difference. Such loans may make sense 
for you when you lack the cash to close a loan or when you plan to keep the loan 
for just a few years.
To minimize your chances of throwing money away applying for a loan that you 
may not qualify for, ask the lender whether he sees any reason your loan request 
may be denied. (Also consider getting pre-approved.) Be sure to disclose any 
problems on your credit report or any problems with the property that you’re 
aware of. Lenders may not take the time to ask about these sorts of things in their 
haste to get you to complete their loan applications.
Finding the best lenders
You can easily save thousands of dollars in interest charges and other fees if you 
shop around for a mortgage deal. It doesn’t matter whether you do so on your own 
or hire someone to help you, but you definitely should shop because a lot of money 
is at stake!
Shopping through a mortgage broker
A competent mortgage broker can be a big help in getting you a good loan and 
closing the deal, especially if you’re too busy or uninterested to dig for a good deal 
on a mortgage. A good mortgage broker also stays abreast of the many different 
mortgages in the marketplace. She can shop among lots of lenders to get you the 

182      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
best deal available. The following list presents some additional advantages to 
working with a mortgage broker:
»
» An organized and detail-oriented mortgage broker can help you through the 
process of completing all those tedious documents that lenders require.
»
» Mortgage brokers can help polish your loan package so the information you 
present is favorable yet truthful.
»
» The best brokers can help educate you about various loan options and the 
pros and cons of available features.
A mortgage broker typically gets paid a percentage, usually 0.5 to 1 percent, of the 
loan amount. This commission is completely negotiable, especially on larger loans 
that are more lucrative. So be sure to ask what the commission is on loans that a 
broker pitches. Some brokers may be indignant that you ask, but that’s their 
problem. You have every right to ask. After all, it’s your money.
Be careful when you choose a mortgage broker because some brokers are lazy and 
don’t shop the market for the best current rates. Even worse, some brokers direct 
their business to specific lenders so they can take a bigger cut or commission.
Even if you plan to shop on your own, talking to a mortgage broker may be worth-
while. At the very least, you can compare what you find with what brokers say 
they can get for you. But again, be careful. Some brokers tell you what you want to 
hear — that they can beat your best find — and then can’t deliver when the time 
comes.
If your loan broker quotes you a really good deal, ask who the lender is. (However, 
do be aware that most brokers refuse to reveal this information until you pay the 
necessary fee to cover the appraisal and credit report.) You can then check with 
the actual lender to verify the interest rate and points that the broker quotes you 
and make sure you’re eligible for the loan.
Shopping by yourself
Many mortgage lenders compete for your business. Although having a large num-
ber of lenders to choose from is good for keeping interest rates lower, it also 
makes shopping a chore, especially if you’re going it alone (instead of using a 
broker). But there’s no substitute for taking the time to speak with numerous 
lenders and exploring the range of options.
Real estate agents may refer you to lenders with whom they’ve done business. Just 
keep in mind that those lenders don’t necessarily offer the most competitive rates; 
the agent simply may have done business with them in the past or received client 
referrals from them.

CHAPTER 13  Financing and Putting Together Real Estate Investments      183
You can get a sense of current rates and start searching for a good deal by visiting 
Internet sites, such as HSH Associates, Bankrate, and Realtor.com that provide 
current rates and lender ads. Use them as a starting point and then call the lenders 
that list the best rates.
Refinancing for a better deal
When you buy a property, you take out a mortgage based on your circumstances 
and available loan options at that time. But things change. Maybe interest rates 
have dropped, or you have access to better loan options now than when you first 
purchased. Or perhaps you want to tap into some of your real estate equity for 
other investments.
If interest rates drop and you’re able to refinance, you can lock in interest rate 
savings. But getting a lower interest rate than the one you got when you took out 
your original mortgage isn’t reason enough to refinance your mortgage. When you 
refinance a mortgage, you have to spend money and time to save money. So you 
need to crunch a few numbers to determine whether refinancing makes financial 
sense for you.
Calculate how many months it will take you to recoup the costs of refinancing, 
such as appraisal costs, loan fees and points, title insurance, and so on. You also 
have to consider tax issues. For example, if the refinance costs you $2,000 to 
complete and reduces your monthly payment by $100, it may appear that you can 
recoup the cost of the refinance in 20 months. However, because you lose some tax 
write-offs if you reduce your mortgage interest rate and payment, you can’t 
­simply look at the reduced amount of your monthly payment.
For a better estimate without spending hours crunching numbers, take your tax 
rate as specified in Chapter 4 (for example, 28 percent) and reduce your monthly 
payment savings on the refinance by this amount. That means, continuing with 
the preceding example, that if your monthly payment drops by $100, you’re actu-
ally saving only around $72 a month after you factor in the lost tax benefits. So it 
takes about 28 months ($2,000 divided by $72), not 20 months, to recoup the 
refinance costs.
Consider refinancing when you can recover the costs of the refinance within a few 
years or less and you don’t plan to move in that time frame. If it takes longer to 
recoup the refinance costs, refinancing may still make sense if you anticipate 
keeping the property and mortgage that long. If you estimate that breaking even 
will take more than five to seven years, refinancing is probably too risky to justify 
the costs and hassles.

184      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Refinancing a piece of real estate that you own to pull out cash for some other 
purpose can make good financial sense because under most circumstances, mort-
gage interest is tax-deductible. Perhaps you want to purchase another piece of 
real estate, start or purchase a business, or get rid of an auto loan or some high-
cost credit card debt. The interest on consumer debt isn’t tax-deductible and is 
usually at a much higher interest rate than what mortgage loans charge you.
Be careful that you don’t borrow more than you need to accomplish your financial 
goals. For example, just because you can borrow more against the equity in your 
real estate doesn’t mean you should do so to buy an expensive new car or take 
your dream vacation.
Working with Real Estate Agents
If you’re like most people, when you purchase real estate, you enlist the services 
of a real estate agent. A good agent can help screen property so you don’t spend all 
your free time looking at potential properties, negotiating a deal, helping coordi-
nate inspections, and managing other pre-closing items.
USING A HOME EQUITY LOAN
Home equity loans, also known as second mortgages, allow you to borrow against the 
equity in your home in addition to the mortgage you already have (a first mortgage).
A home equity loan may benefit you if you need more money for just a few years or if 
your first mortgage is at such a low interest rate that refinancing it to get more cash 
would be too costly. Otherwise, I advise you to avoid home equity loans.
If you need a larger mortgage, why not refinance the first one and wrap it all together? 
Home equity loans have higher interest rates than comparable first mortgages because 
they’re riskier from a lender’s perspective. They’re riskier because the first mortgage 
lender gets first claim against your property if you file bankruptcy or you default on the 
mortgage.
Interest on home mortgage loans of up to $1 million (first or second residences) is tax-
deductible. Interest deduction on home equity loans is limited to the first $100,000 of 
such debt.

CHAPTER 13  Financing and Putting Together Real Estate Investments      185
Recognizing agent conflicts of interest
All real estate agents (good, mediocre, and awful) are subject to a conflict of inter-
est because of the way they’re compensated: on commission. I respect real estate 
agents for calling themselves what they are. They don’t hide behind an obscure 
job title, such as “shelter consultant.” (Many financial “planners,” “advisors,” or 
“consultants,” for example, actually work on commission and sell investments 
and life insurance and therefore are really stockbrokers and insurance brokers, 
not planners or advisors.)
Real estate agents aren’t in the business of providing objective financial counsel. 
Just as car dealers make their living selling cars, real estate agents make their liv-
ing selling real estate. Never forget this fact as a buyer.
The pursuit of a larger commission may encourage an agent to get you to do 
things that aren’t in your best interest, such as the following:
»
» Buy, and buy sooner rather than later: If you don’t buy, your agent doesn’t 
get paid for all the hours she spends working with you. The worst agents fib 
and use tricks to motivate you to buy. They may say, for example, that other 
offers are coming in on a property that interests you, or they may show you a 
bunch of dumps and then one good listing that has much of what you’re 
looking for to motivate you to buy the nicer property.
»
» Spend more than you should: Because real estate agents get a percentage 
of the sales price of a property, they have a built-in incentive to encourage 
you to spend more on a property than what fits comfortably with your other 
financial objectives and goals. An agent doesn’t have to consider or care about 
your other financial needs.
»
» Purchase their company’s listings: Agents also have a built-in incentive 
(higher commission) to sell their own listings. So don’t be surprised when an 
agent pushes you in the direction of one of her own company’s properties.
»
» Buy in their territory: Real estate agents typically work a specific territory. 
As a result, they usually can’t objectively tell you the pros and cons of the 
surrounding region.
»
» Use people who scratch their backs: Some agents refer you to mortgage 
brokers, lenders, inspectors, and title insurance companies that have referred 
customers to them. Some agents also solicit and receive referral fees (or 
bribes) from mortgage lenders, inspectors, and contractors to whom they 
refer business.

186      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Selecting a good agent
A mediocre, incompetent, or greedy agent can be a real danger to your finances. 
Whether you’re hiring an agent to work with you as a buyer or as a seller, you 
want someone who’s competent and with whom you can get along. Working with 
an agent costs a good deal of money, so make sure you get your money’s worth out 
of him.
Interview several agents and check references. Ask agents for the names and 
phone numbers of at least three clients with whom they’ve worked in the past six 
months in the geographical area in which you’re looking. By narrowing the period 
during which they worked with these references, you maximize the chances of 
speaking with clients other than the agent’s all-time-favorite clients.
As you speak with an agent’s references, ask about these traits in any agent that 
you’re considering working with, whether as a buyer or as a seller:
»
» Full-time employment: Some agents work in real estate as a second or even 
third job. Information in this field changes constantly, so keeping track of it is 
challenging on a full-time basis. It’s hard to imagine a good agent being able to 
stay on top of the market on a part-time basis while working full time elsewhere.
»
» Experience: Hiring someone with experience doesn’t necessarily mean 
looking for an agent who’s sold real estate for decades. Many of the best 
agents come into the field from other occupations, such as business and 
teaching. Agents can acquire some sales, marketing, negotiation, and 
communication skills in other fields. However, keep in mind that some 
experience in real estate or a related field does count.
»
» Honesty and integrity: You need to trust your agent with a lot of informa-
tion. If the agent doesn’t level with you about what a neighborhood or 
particular property is really like, you suffer the consequences.
»
» Interpersonal skills: An agent must get along not only with you but also with 
a whole host of other people who are involved in a typical real estate deal: 
other agents, property sellers, inspectors, mortgage lenders, and so on. An 
agent needs to know how to put your interests first without upsetting others.
»
» Negotiation skills: Putting a real estate deal together involves negotiation. Is 
your agent going to exhaust all avenues to get you the best deal possible? 
Most people don’t like the sometimes aggravating process of negotiation, so 
they hire someone else to do it for them. Be sure to ask the agent’s former 
client references how the agent negotiated for them.
»
» High quality standards: Sloppy work can lead to big legal or logistical 
problems down the road. If an agent neglects to recommend an inspection, 
for example, you may get stuck with undiscovered problems after the deal is 
done and paid for.

CHAPTER 13  Financing and Putting Together Real Estate Investments      187
Agents who pitch themselves as buyers’ brokers claim they work for your inter-
ests. However, agents who represent you as a buyer’s broker still get paid only 
when you buy. And agents still get paid a commission that’s a percentage of the 
purchase price. So they still have an incentive to sell you a piece of real estate 
that’s more expensive because their commission increases.
Some agents market themselves as top producers, meaning that they sell a rela-
tively larger volume of real estate. This title doesn’t matter much to you, the 
buyer. In fact, you may use this information as a potential red flag for an agent 
who focuses on completing as many deals as possible. Such an agent may not be 
able to give you the time and help you need to get the house you want.
When you buy a home, you need an agent who is patient and allows you the neces-
sary time to educate yourself and who helps you make the decision that’s best for 
you. The last thing you need is an agent who tries to push you into making a deal.
You also need an agent who’s knowledgeable about the local market and commu-
nity. If you want to buy a home in an area where you don’t currently live, an 
informed agent can have a big impact on your decision.
Finding an agent with financing knowledge is a plus for buyers, especially first-
time buyers or those with credit problems. Such an agent may be able to refer you 
to lenders that can handle your type of situation, which can save you a lot of 
legwork.
BUYING WITHOUT A REAL ESTATE AGENT
You can purchase property without an agent if you’re willing to do some additional  
legwork. You need to do the things that a high-quality real estate agent does, such as 
searching for properties, scheduling appointments to see those properties, determining 
fair market value, negotiating the deal, and coordinating inspections.
If you don’t work with an agent, have a real estate attorney review the various contracts. 
Having someone else not vested in the transaction look out for your interests helps 
your situation. Real estate agents generally aren’t legal experts, so getting legal advice 
from an attorney is generally better. (In fact, in some states, you need to hire an attor-
ney in addition to the real estate agent.)
One possible drawback to working without an agent is performing the negotiations 
yourself. Negotiating can be problematic if you lack these skills or get too caught up 
emotionally in the situation.

188      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Putting Your Deal Together
After you locate a property you want to buy and you understand your financing 
options, the real fun begins. At this point, you have to put the deal together. The 
following sections discuss key things to keep in mind.
Negotiating basics
When you work with an agent, she usually carries the burden of the negotiation 
process. But even if you delegate that responsibility to your agent, you still should 
have a strategy in mind. Otherwise, you may overpay for real estate. Here’s what 
you should do:
»
» Find out about the property and the owner before you make your offer. 
How long has the property been on the market? What are its flaws? Why is the 
owner selling? The more you understand about the property you want to buy 
and the seller’s motivations, the better your ability to draft an offer that meets 
everyone’s needs. Some listing agents love to talk and will tell you the life 
history of the seller. Either you or your agent may be able to get a listing agent 
to reveal helpful information about the seller.
»
» Bring facts to the bargaining table; get comparable sales data to support 
your price. Too often, homebuyers and their agents pick a number out of the 
air when they make an offer. If you were the seller, would you be persuaded 
to lower your asking price? Pointing to recent and comparable home sales to 
justify your offer price strengthens your case.
Price is only one of several negotiable items. Sometimes sellers fixate on 
selling their homes for a certain amount. Perhaps they want to get at least 
what they paid for it several years ago. You may get a seller to pay for certain 
repairs or improvements or to offer you an attractive loan without all the 
extra fees that a bank charges. Also, be aware that the time for closing on the 
purchase is a bargaining point. Some sellers may need cash fast and may 
concede other terms if you can close quickly. Likewise, the real estate agent’s 
commission is negotiable.
»
» Try to leave your emotions out of any property purchase. Being objective 
rather than emotional regarding a purchase is easier said than done, and it’s 
hardest to do when buying a home in which you’ll live. So do your best not to 
fall in love with a property. Keep searching for other properties even when 
you make an offer because you may be negotiating with an unmotivated 
seller.

CHAPTER 13  Financing and Putting Together Real Estate Investments      189
Inspecting the property
Unless you’ve built homes and other properties and performed contracting work 
yourself, you probably have no idea what you’re getting yourself into when it 
comes to furnaces and termites.
Spend the money and take the time to hire inspectors and other experts to evalu-
ate the major systems and potential problem areas of the home. Because you can’t 
be certain of the seller’s commitment, I recommend you do the inspections after 
you’ve successfully negotiated and signed a sales contract. Even though you won’t 
have the feedback from the inspections to help with this round of negotiating, you 
can always go back to the seller with the new information. Make your purchase 
offer contingent on a satisfactory inspection.
Hire people to help you inspect the following features of the property:
»
» Overall condition of the property (for example, look for peeling paint, level 
floors, appliances that work properly, and so on)
»
» Electrical, heating and air conditioning, and plumbing systems
»
» Foundation
»
» Roof
»
» Pest control and dry rot
»
» Seismic/slide/flood risk
Inspection fees often pay for themselves. If you uncover problems you weren’t 
aware of when you negotiated the original purchase price, the inspection reports 
give you the information you need so you can go back and ask the property seller 
to fix the problems or reduce the property’s purchase price.
Never accept a seller’s inspection report as your only source of information. When 
a seller hires an inspector, he may hire someone who isn’t as diligent and critical 
of the property. Review the seller’s inspection reports if available, but also get 
your own evaluation. And beware of inspectors who are popular with real estate 
agents. They may be popular because they don’t bother to document all the prop-
erty’s problems.
As with other professionals whose services you retain, interview a few different 
inspection companies. Ask which systems they inspect and how detailed of a 
report they can prepare for you. Consider asking the company that you’re thinking 
of hiring for customer references. Ask for names and phone numbers of three 
people who used the company’s services within the past six months. Also request 
from each inspection company a sample of one of its reports.

190      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
The day before you close on the purchase, take a brief walk-through of the prop-
erty to make sure everything is still in the condition it was before and that all the 
fixtures, appliances, curtains, and other items the contract lists are still there. 
Sometimes, sellers ignore or don’t recall these things, and consequently, they 
don’t leave what they agreed to leave in the sales contract.
Shopping for title insurance  
and escrow services
Mortgage lenders require title insurance to protect against someone else claiming 
legal title to your property. For example, when a husband and wife split up, the 
one who remains in the home may decide to sell and take off with the money. If 
the title lists both spouses as owners, the spouse who sells the property (possibly 
by forging the other’s signature) has no legal right to do so. The other spouse can 
come back and reclaim rights to the home even after it has been sold. In this event, 
both you and the lender can get stuck holding the bag. (If you’re in the enviable 
position of paying cash for a property, buying title insurance is still wise to protect 
your investment, even though a mortgage lender won’t prod you to do so.)
Title insurance and escrow charges vary from company to company. (Escrow 
charges pay for neutral third-party services to ensure that the instructions of the 
purchase contract or refinance are fulfilled and that everyone gets paid.) Don’t 
simply use the company that your real estate agent or mortgage lender suggests —  
shop around. When you call around for title insurance and escrow fee quotes, 
make sure you understand all the fees. Many companies tack on all sorts of charges 
for things such as courier fees and express mail. If you find a company with lower 
prices and want to use it, consider asking for an itemization in writing so you 
don’t receive any unpleasant surprises.
An insurance company’s ability to pay claims is always important. Most state 
insurance departments monitor and regulate title insurance companies. Title 
insurers rarely fail, and most state departments of insurance do a good job of 
shutting down financially unstable ones. Check with your state’s department if 
you’re concerned. You can also ask the title insurer for copies of its ratings from 
insurance-rating agencies.
Selling Real Estate
Buying and holding real estate for the long term really pays off. If you do your 
homework, buy in a good area, and work hard to find a fairly priced or underpriced 
property, why sell it quickly and incur all the selling costs, time, and hassle to 
locate and negotiate another property to purchase?

CHAPTER 13  Financing and Putting Together Real Estate Investments      191
Some real estate investors like to buy properties in need of improvement, fix them 
up, and then sell them and move on to another. Unless you’re a contractor or 
experienced real estate investor and have a real eye for this type of work, don’t 
expect to make a windfall or even to earn back more than the cost of the improve-
ments. The process of buying, fixing, and flipping can be profitable, but it’s not as 
easy as the home-improvement television shows and some books would have you 
believe. In fact, you’re more likely to erode your profit through the myriad costs 
of frequent buying and selling. The vast majority of your profits should come from 
the long-term appreciation of the overall real estate market in the communities in 
which you own property.
Use the reasons that you bought in an area as a guide for considering selling. 
Review the criteria that I discuss in Chapter 12 as a guideline. For example, if the 
schools in the community are deteriorating and the planning department is allow-
ing development that will hurt the value of your property and the rents that you 
can charge, you may have cause to sell. Unless you see significant problems like 
these in the future, holding good properties over many years is a great way to 
build your wealth and minimize transaction costs.
Negotiating real estate agents’ contracts
Most people use an agent to sell real estate. As I discuss in “Selecting a good 
agent” earlier in this chapter, selling and buying a home demand agents with dif-
ferent strengths. When you sell a property, you want an agent who can get the job 
done efficiently and for the highest possible sales price.
As a seller, seek agents who have marketing and sales expertise and who are will-
ing to put in the time and money necessary to sell your house. Don’t be impressed 
by an agent just because she works for a large company. What matters more is 
what the agent can do to market your property.
When you list a property for sale, the contract that you sign with the listing agent 
includes specification of the commission that you pay the agent if she succeeds in 
selling your property. In most areas of the country, agents usually ask for a 
6 ­percent commission for single-family homes. In an area with relatively low-
priced housing, agents may ask for 7 percent. For small multifamily properties and 
commercial properties, commissions often hover around the 3 to 5 percent range.
Regardless of the commission an agent says is “typical,” “standard,” or “what 
my manager requires,” always remember you can negotiate commissions. Because 
the commission is a percentage, you have a much greater ability to get a lower 
commission on a higher-priced property. If an agent makes 6 percent selling both 
a $200,000 and a $100,000 property, the agent makes twice as much on the 
$200,000 property. Yet selling the higher-priced property doesn’t usually take 
twice as much work.

192      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
If you live in an area with generally higher-priced properties, you may be able to 
negotiate a 5 percent commission. For really expensive properties, a 4 percent 
commission is reasonable. You may find, however, that your ability to negotiate a 
lower commission is greatest when an offer is on the table. Because of the coop-
eration of agents who work together through the multiple listing service (MLS), if 
you list your real estate for sale at a lower commission than most other properties, 
some agents won’t show it to prospective buyers. For this reason, you’re better off 
having your listing agent cut his take instead of cutting the commission you pay 
to a real estate agent who brings a buyer for your property.
In terms of the length of the listing agreement, 3 months is reasonable. If you give 
an agent too long to list your property (6 to 12 months), the agent may simply toss 
your listing into the multiple listing database and not expend much effort to get 
your property sold. Practically speaking, you can fire your agent whenever you 
want, regardless of the length of the listing agreement, but a shorter listing may 
motivate your agent more. A shorter listing period also allows you to more easily 
part company with your agent if he doesn’t do a good job and to move on to some-
one who will.
Selling without an agent
The temptation to sell real estate without an agent is usually to save the commis-
sion that an agent deducts from your property’s sale price. If you have the time, 
energy, and marketing experience, you can sell sans agent and possibly save some 
money.
The major problem with attempting to sell real estate on your own is that you 
can’t list it in the MLS, which, in most areas, only real estate agents can access. If 
you’re not listed in the MLS, many potential buyers never know that your home is 
for sale. Agents who work with buyers don’t generally look for or show properties 
that are for sale by owner or listed with discount brokers.
Besides saving you time, a good agent can help ensure you’re not sued for failing 
to disclose known defects of your property. If you decide to sell on your own, con-
tact a local real estate legal advisor who can review the contracts. Take the time to 
educate yourself about the many facets of selling property for top dollar. Read the 
latest edition of House Selling For Dummies, which I co-authored with Ray Brown 
(published by Wiley).

Taking Your Talents to 
the Small-Business 
Arena
M
any people’s American Dream isn’t a 9-to-5 job working for someone 
else, especially a large company, for the duration of their career. A lot of 
these folks dream of starting and running their own business. Making 
plenty of money, being their own boss, and having flexibility in setting their hours 
are often part of the dream.
I’ve known plenty of dreamers over the years, as well as those who achieved their 
dream. This chapter is designed to help you to invest in yourself by making the 
most of your working years and figuring out how to pursue entrepreneurial 
endeavors, if that’s what you desire. I also discuss alternative ways to invest in 
small business that don’t involve starting a business from scratch.

194      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Investing in Your Career
Some people aren’t going to enjoy — or be successful — as entrepreneurs. The 
simple truth and reality is that some folks are better off working for someone else. 
Plenty of people are happy or content as employees. There are many solid compa-
nies that need and want good employees, so you should be able to find a desirable 
job if you have skills, a good work ethic, and the ability to get along with others.
The global economy is increasingly competitive, and those whose skills don’t 
measure up will have a harder time finding the best jobs at the best wages. Well-
paying, interesting jobs are out there, but applicants must have the right kind of 
background and training.
You can make the most of your income-earning ability and invest in your career 
in a variety of ways:
»
» Get useful experience. You probably have in your mind at least a dream job 
(such as working for a particular company or organization). The reality, 
however, is you may not have the requisite training and experience to land 
the dream job right now. So you have to figure out what jobs will allow you to 
tap your talents and help you gain needed experience to realize your dream.
»
» Read. One of the reasons you don’t need an advanced degree or even a fancy 
liberal-arts undergraduate college degree to succeed in business is that you 
can find out a lot on your own. You can gain insight by doing, but you can also 
gain expertise by reading. A good bookstore or well-stocked library has no 
entrance requirements, such as a high grade-point average or SAT score. A 
good book costs a heck of a lot less than taking college or graduate courses!
You can read lots of “content” online. Just be sure you understand the quality 
and source of what you’re consuming. If something is “free,” investigate how 
the purveyor ultimately makes money and what its bias and agenda may be.
»
» Continue your education. If you haven’t completed your college or graduate 
degree and the industry you’re in values those who have, consider investing 
the time and money to finish your education. Speak with others who have 
taken that path, and see what they have to say. Also, check out the increasing 
numbers of online courses being offered on sites like www.academicearth.
org, www.coursera.org, www.edx.org, and www.udemy.com.
»
» Work hard. Be willing to work extra hours and take on more responsibility. 
Those who take extra initiative and then deliver really stand out in a company 
where many people working on a salary have a time-clock, 9-to-5 mentality. 

CHAPTER 14  Taking Your Talents to the Small-Business Arena      195
Be careful, however, that the extra effort doesn’t contribute to workaholism, a 
dangerous addiction that causes folks to neglect important personal relation-
ships and their own health. Don’t bite off more than you can chew; otherwise, 
your supervisors won’t have faith that they can count on you to deliver. Find 
ways to work smarter, not just longer, hours.
Deciding to Start Your Own Business
Should you start your own business? It’s often a difficult decision for most people, 
and it’s the first question you should answer before turning your business idea 
into the reality of your start-up company. In addition to helping you decide 
whether to start your own business, in this section I discuss a potentially attrac-
tive alternative: being an entrepreneur inside an established company.
Weighing your options
Of all your small-business options, starting your own business involves the great-
est amount of work. Although you can perform this work on a part-time basis in 
the beginning, most people end up working in their business full-time.
For most of my working years, I’ve run my own business, and overall, I really like 
it. In my experience counseling small-business owners, I’ve seen many people of 
varied backgrounds, interests, and skills achieve success and happiness running 
their own businesses.
Most people perceive starting their own business as the riskiest of all small-­
business investment options. But if you get into a business that uses your skills 
and expertise, the risk isn’t nearly as great as you may think.
Instead of leaving your job cold turkey and trying to build your business from 
scratch, you may be able to make progress by moonlighting. Many an entrepre-
neur has laid a nice foundation for his business over a couple of years by building 
up his business in this fashion.
You can start many businesses with little money by leveraging your existing skills 
and expertise. If you have the time to devote to building sweat equity, you can 
build a valuable company and job. As long as you check out the competition and 
offer a valued product or service at a reasonable cost, a principal risk with your 
business is that you won’t do a good job of marketing what you have to offer.

196      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Sometimes entrepreneurial advocates imply that running your own business or 
starting your own not-for-profit organization is the greatest thing in the world 
and that all people would be happy owning their own businesses if they just set 
their minds to it. Starting and running a business aren’t for everyone, though. The 
good news: Other options may offer you the best of both worlds.
Entrepreneuring at a company
Wouldn’t it be great if you could have a job that gave you the challenge and upside 
of running your own business, with the security and support that come with a 
company environment? This combination does exist  — if you can manage an 
entrepreneurial venture at a company.
If you’re able to secure an entrepreneurial position inside a larger company, in 
addition to gaining significant managerial and operational responsibility, you can 
negotiate your share of the financial success that you help create. The parent 
company’s senior management wants you to have the incentive that comes from 
sharing in the financial success of your endeavors. Bonuses, stock options, and the 
like are often tied to a division’s performance.
For more small-business options beyond starting your own business or leading an 
entrepreneurial effort inside an established company, see “Considering Small-
Business Investment Options” later in this chapter.
Turning a Business Idea into Reality
Ideas are a dime a dozen. I’d love to see you turn your best ideas into reality. To 
make that happen, you should develop a business plan, lay the groundwork finan-
cially and emotionally to leave your job, and determine how you’re going to 
finance your new venture. I cover these topics in this section.
Drawing up your business plan
If you’re motivated to start your own business, the next step is to prepare a busi-
ness plan. Your business plan should be a working document or blueprint for the 
early days, months, and years of your business. It should enable you to plan your 
goals, apply for and obtain loans, and show potential investors what you plan to 
do with any money they would invest in or loan to your business.

CHAPTER 14  Taking Your Talents to the Small-Business Arena      197
The amount of detail that your plan needs depends on your goals and the specifics 
of your business. A simple, more short-term-focused plan of 10 pages or less is 
fine if your goal is a “smaller” small business. However, if your goal is to grow, 
hire employees, and open multiple locations, your plan generally needs to be more 
substantial (30 to 50 pages) to address longer-term issues. If you want to solicit 
outside investors, a longer business plan is a necessity.
As you put together your business plan and evaluate your opportunities and chal-
lenges, keep your ears and eyes open. Expect to do research, and speak with other 
entrepreneurs and people in the industry. Most folks will spend time talking with 
you as long as they realize that you don’t want to directly compete with their 
businesses.
What follows are the highlights your business plan should cover:
»
» The executive summary: An executive summary is a two- to three-page 
summary of your entire business plan that you can share with interested 
investors who don’t have the time and desire to wade through a lengthy plan. 
The executive summary whets the prospective investor’s appetite by touching 
on the highlights of your entire plan.
»
» Business-concept definition: What do you want your business to do? What 
product or service do you want to offer? Your concept doesn’t need to be 
unique to survive in the business world. The existence of plenty of other 
businesses doing what you want to do validates the potential for your 
small-business ideas. I’m not suggesting that an innovative idea lacks merit. 
Indeed, a creative idea gives you the chance to hit it big, and being the first 
person to successfully develop a new idea can help you achieve big success.
»
» Your objectives: Before starting your firm, think about your objectives, or 
what you’re seeking to achieve. Your objectives will likely evolve over time. 
Most for-profit businesses, not surprisingly, seek to maximize profits. Other 
common objectives can include working with people you like and respect, 
educating others, and improving an industry or setting a higher standard. You 
can’t accomplish these loftier objectives without profits, of course, and doing 
these things isn’t inconsistent with generating greater profits.
»
» Understanding of the marketplace: The single most important area to 
understand is the marketplace in which your business competes. To be 
successful, your business must not only produce a good product or service 
but also reach customers and persuade them to buy your product at a price 
at which you can make a profit. So you must understand your desired 
customers and their needs. Discern what the competition has to offer, as well 
as its strengths and weaknesses. You also need to understand government 
regulations that affect the type of business that you’re considering.

198      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
»
» Plans to deliver your service or product: How are you going to provide your 
product or service to your customers? If you want to manufacture a product, 
you definitely need to scope out the process you’re going to use. Otherwise, 
you have no idea how much time the manufacturing process may take or 
what the process may cost. As your business grows and you hire employees 
to provide services or create your products, the more you document what you 
do, and the better your employees can replicate your good work.
»
» Plans to market your service or product: How much will you charge for 
your services and products? How will you position your products and services 
compared with the competition? Where will you sell your product or service? 
Finding and retaining customers is vital to any business owner who wants her 
company to grow and be profitable. One simple, inexpensive way to stay in 
touch with customers you’ve dealt with or others who have made inquiries 
and expressed interest in your company’s offerings is via a mailing list. 
Software and websites (such as Constant Contact) give you fast, efficient ways 
to keep customer mailing lists up to date and print mailing labels if desired.
»
» Plans to organize and staff your business: Many small businesses are 
one-person operations — so much the better for you if that’s what you desire, 
because you’ll have none of the headaches of hiring, payroll, and so on. But if 
you hope to grow your business and would rather manage the work being 
done instead of doing all of it yourself, you’ll eventually want to hire people. 
Give some thought now to the skills and functional areas of expertise that 
future hires will need. If you want to raise money, the employment section of 
your business plan is essential to show your investors that you’re planning 
long-term. Also consider what legal form of organization — sole proprietor-
ship, partnership, S corporation, limited liability company, and so on — your 
business will adopt. This decision affects how the business is taxed and what 
its liabilities are in the event of a lawsuit, among other important issues.
»
» Financial projections: An idea may become a business failure if you neglect to 
consider, or are unrealistic about, the financial side of the business you want 
to start. Financial projections are mandatory, and knowledgeable investors will 
scrutinize them if you seek outside money. Before the revenue begins to flow 
in, you incur expenditures as you develop and market your products and 
services. Therefore, you need to understand what you must spend money on 
and the approximate timing of the needed purchases. Preparing an estimated 
income statement that summarizes your expected revenue and expenses is a 
challenging and important part of your business plan.
A balance sheet details a company’s assets and liabilities. A detailed balance 
sheet isn’t as important as tracking your available cash, which will likely be 
under pressure in the early years of a business because expenses can 
continue to exceed revenue for quite some time. A complete balance sheet is 
useful for a business that owns significant equipment, furniture, inventory, 
and so on.

CHAPTER 14  Taking Your Talents to the Small-Business Arena      199
After you research and evaluate the needs of your prospective business, at some 
point you need to decide whether to actually start your business. If you really want 
to, you can conduct and analyze market research and crunch numbers until the 
cows come home. Even if you’re a linear, logical, analytic, quantitative kind of 
person, you ultimately need to make a gut-level decision: Do you jump in the 
water and start swimming, or do you stay on the sidelines and remain a spectator? 
In my opinion, watching isn’t nearly as fun as doing. If you feel ready but have 
some trepidation, that’s normal.
Mind you, I’m not trying to present a rosy view of entrepreneurship. Plenty of 
small businesses fail, and plenty of small-business owners end up losing rather 
than making money.
Plotting to leave your job
You may never discover that you have the talent to run your own business, and 
perhaps have a good idea to boot, unless you prepare yourself financially and psy-
chologically to leave your job. Financial and emotional issues cause many aspiring 
entrepreneurs to remain chained to their employers and cause those who do break 
free to soon return to their bondage.
On the financial side, plan for a reduction in the income that you bring home from 
work, at least in the early years of your business. Do all you can to reduce your 
expenses to a level that fits the entrepreneurial life that you want to lead.
In addition to reducing your spending before and during the period that you start 
your business, figure out how to manage the income side of your personal finances. 
One way to pursue your entrepreneurial dreams is to continue working part-time 
in a regular job while you work part-time at your own business. If you have a job 
that allows you to work part-time, seize the opportunity. Just be sure that the 
outside work you’re doing doesn’t conflict with your regular job.
Another option is to completely leave your job but line up work that provides a 
decent income for a portion of your weekly work hours. Consulting for your old 
employer is a time-tested first “entrepreneurial” option with low risk.
For many people, walking away from their employer’s benefits (including insur-
ance, retirement funds, and paid time off) is both financially and emotionally 
challenging. Benefits are valuable, but you may be surprised by how efficiently 
you can replicate them in your own business:
»
» Health insurance: The first option to explore is whether your existing 
coverage through your employer’s group plan can be converted to individual 
coverage (through COBRA). Also, get proposals for individual coverage from 

200      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
major health plans in your area. Take a high deductible, if available, to keep 
costs down. Having a high-deductible health plan, which is defined as an 
individual plan with a deductible of at least $1,350 or a family plan with a 
minimum $2,700 deductible for tax year (this amount increases over time with 
inflation), qualifies you to contribute money to a health savings account (HSA). 
Contributions to an HSA reduce your current year’s taxable income, and the 
money compounds without taxation over time. Withdrawals aren’t taxed so 
long as you use the money for qualified health-care expenses, which are 
broadly defined.
»
» Long-term disability insurance: Your greatest asset probably is your ability 
to earn money. Long-term disability (LTD) insurance protects your work 
income in the event of a disability. Before you leave your job, secure an 
individual LTD policy. After you leave your job and are no longer earning 
steady income, you won’t qualify for a policy. Check with any professional 
associations that you belong to or could join to see whether they offer LTD 
plans. Association plans are sometimes less expensive because of the group’s 
purchasing power.
»
» Life insurance: If you have dependents who count on your income, you need 
life insurance. You can generally purchase a life insurance policy on your own 
for less money than additional coverage through your employer would cost.
»
» Retirement savings plans: If your employer offers retirement savings 
programs, such as a 401(k) plan or a pension plan, don’t despair about not 
having these in the future. One of the best benefits of self-employment is the 
availability of SEP-IRAs, which allow you to sock away up to 20 percent of your 
net income on a tax-deductible basis. With employees, the decision is a bit 
more complicated but often still a great idea.
Financing your business
While creating your business plan (discussed earlier in the chapter), you should 
estimate your business’s start-up and development costs. Luckily, you can start 
many worthwhile small businesses with little capital, but you will need capital — 
and for some businesses, significant amounts.
Here are proven, time-tested methods of financing your business:
»
» Bootstrapping: Bootstrapping simply means that a business lives within its 
own means and without external support. This funding strategy generally 
forces a business to be more resourceful and less wasteful. Bootstrapping is 
also a great training mechanism for producing cost-effective products and 
services. It offers you the advantage of getting into business with little capital.

CHAPTER 14  Taking Your Talents to the Small-Business Arena      201
Misconceptions abound about how much money a company needs to achieve 
its goals and sources of funding. The vast majority of small businesses obtain 
their initial capital from personal savings, relatives, and friends rather than 
from outside sources, such as banks and venture capital firms.
Eventually, a successful, growing company may want outside financing to 
expand faster. Raising money from investors or lenders is much easier after 
you demonstrate that you know what you’re doing and that a market exists 
for your product or service.
»
» Taking out business loans: If you’re starting a new business or have been in 
business for just a few years, borrowing, particularly from banks, may be 
difficult. Borrowing money is easier when you don’t really need to do so. No 
one knows this fact better than small-business owners. To borrow money 
from a bank, you generally need a business plan, three years of financial 
statements and tax returns for the business and its owner, and projections for 
the business. Seek out banks that are committed to and understand the 
small-business marketplace.
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers workshops and counsel-
ing services for small-business owners. Its SCORE (Service Corps of Retired 
Executives) consulting services (www.score.org; 800-634-0245) provide free 
advice and critiques of business plans, as well as advice on raising money for 
your business. For more information on the SBA’s services and how to contact 
a local office, call 800-827-5722, or visit its website at www.sba.gov.
If you don’t have luck with banks or the SBA, credit unions can be a source of 
financial help. They’re often more willing to make personal loans to individuals.
»
» Borrowing from relatives and friends: Because they know you and (ideally) 
like and trust you, your family members and friends may seem like good 
sources of investment money for your small business. They also likely have 
the added advantage of offering you better terms than a banker, wealthy 
investor, or a venture capitalist. Be sure to prepare and sign a letter of 
agreement that spells out the terms of the investment or loan and that states 
that you had a candid discussion with all involved as to the risks and downside 
if things don’t work out the way you hope.
»
» Tapping investors for an equity investment: Beyond family members and 
friends, wealthy individuals are your next best source of capital if you want an 
equity investor. An angel investor is a wealthy individual who invests in small 
companies and has a track record of success in funding somewhat-similar 
businesses. Angels bring things to the table besides money, such as strategic 
advice and helpful business contacts.

202      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Finding folks who may be interested in investing requires persistence and 
creativity. Try consulting tax advisors and attorneys you know who may have 
contacts, and network with successful entrepreneurs in similar fields. Also 
consider customers or suppliers who like your business and believe in its 
potential.
Considering Small-Business  
Investment Options
Only your imagination limits the ways you can make money with small busi-
nesses. Choosing the option that best meets your needs isn’t unlike choosing 
other investments, such as in real estate or in the financial markets. In this sec-
tion, I discuss the major ways you can invest in small business, including what’s 
attractive and not so attractive about each option.
Buying an existing business
If you don’t have a specific idea for a business that you want to start, but you have 
business management skills and an ability to improve existing businesses, con-
sider buying an established business.
Although you don’t have to go through the riskier start-up period if you take this 
route, you’ll likely need more capital to buy a going enterprise. You also need to be 
able to deal with potentially sticky personnel and management issues. The history 
of the organization and the way things work predate your ownership of the busi-
ness. If you don’t like making hard decisions, firing people who don’t fit with your 
plans, and coercing people to change the way they did things before you arrived 
on the scene, buying an existing business likely isn’t for you. Also realize that 
some of the good employees may be loyal to the old owner and his style of running 
the business, so they may split when you arrive.
Some people perceive that buying an existing business is safer than starting a new 
one, but buying someone else’s business can actually be riskier. You have to put 
out far more money up-front, in the form of a down payment, to buy a business. 
And if you don’t have the ability to run the business, and it does poorly, you may 
lose much more financially. Another risk is that the business may be for sale for a 
reason. Perhaps it’s not very profitable, it’s in decline, or it’s generally a pain in 
the posterior to operate.

CHAPTER 14  Taking Your Talents to the Small-Business Arena      203
Good businesses that are for sale don’t come cheaply. If the business is a success, 
the current owner has removed the start-up risk from the business, so the price 
of the business should include a premium to reflect this reduced risk. If you have 
the capital to buy an established business and the skills to run it, consider going 
this route.
Investing in someone else’s business
If you like the idea of profiting from successful small businesses but don’t want 
the day-to-day responsibility of managing the enterprise, you may want to invest 
in someone else’s small business. Although this route may seem easier, fewer 
people are actually cut out to be investors in other people’s businesses.
Consider investing in someone else’s business if the following points describe you:
»
» You have sufficient assets: You need enough assets so that what you invest 
in small, privately held companies is a small portion (20 percent or less) of 
your total financial assets.
»
» You can afford to lose what you invest: Unlike with investing in a diversified 
stock fund, you may lose all of your investment when you invest in a small, 
privately held company.
»
» You’re astute at evaluating financial statements and business strategies: 
Investing in a small, privately held company has much in common with 
investing in a publicly traded firm. A main difference is that private firms aren’t 
required to produce comprehensive, audited financial statements that adhere 
to certain accounting principles, the way public companies are. Thus, you have 
a greater risk of not receiving sufficient or accurate information when you 
evaluate a small, private firm. (There are also liquidity differences, in that with 
a small, private company, you may not be able to sell out when you want and 
at a fair current price.)
Putting money into your own business (or someone else’s) can be a high-risk but 
potentially high-return investment. The best options are those that you under-
stand well. If you hear about a great business idea or company from someone you 
know and trust, do your research, and use your best judgment. That company or 
idea may be a terrific investment.
Before investing, read and review the business plan. Thoroughly check out the 
people who are running the business. Talk to others who don’t have a stake in the 
investment; you can benefit from their comments and concerns. Remember, 
though, that many a wise person has rained on the parade of what turned out to 
be a terrific business idea.

204      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Looking at franchises
Purchasing a good franchise can be your ticket into the world of small-business 
ownership. Franchising makes up a huge part of the business world. Companies 
that franchise  — such as Papa John’s, Jiffy Lube, 7-Eleven stores, Gymboree, 
Century 21 Real Estate, Supercuts, Holiday Inn, Avis, Smoothie King, Subway, and 
Foot Locker — account for more than $1 trillion in sales annually.
When you purchase a franchise, you buy the local rights to a specified geographic 
territory to sell the company’s products or services under the company’s name 
and to use the company’s system of operation. In addition to an up-front franchi-
see fee, franchisers also typically charge an ongoing royalty.
Here are the primary advantages that come with a good franchise:
»
» Proven business: A company that has been in business for several years and 
has successful franchisees proves the demand for the company’s products 
and services and shows that the company’s system for providing those 
products and services works. As a franchise owner, you benefit from and 
share in the experience that the parent company has gained over the years.
»
» Name-brand recognition: Some consumers recognize the company name of 
a larger and successful franchise company and may be more inclined to 
purchase its products and services. The comfort that comes from dealing with 
such firms may stem from the influence of advertisements, recommendations 
of friends, or your own familiarity with their services in another part of the 
country. Most freestanding small businesses for sale in a community lack this 
name-brand recognition.
»
» Centralized purchasing power: You would hope and expect that a corpora-
tion made up of hundreds of locations buys supplies at a low price. (Volume 
purchasing generally leads to bigger discounts.) In addition to possibly saving 
franchisees money on supplies, the parent company can take the hassle out 
of figuring out where and how to purchase supplies. Again, most unattached 
small businesses that you could buy won’t offer this advantage. However, 
quality business associations can provide some of these benefits.
When you purchase a new franchise, as with starting a business, you must find 
customers. However, the parent company should have a track record and multiple 
locations with customers. (You can also purchase existing franchises from owners 
who want to sell, and these businesses come complete with customers.)

CHAPTER 14  Taking Your Talents to the Small-Business Arena      205
Buying a franchise isn’t for everyone. Here are some common problems that may 
cause you to reconsider buying a franchise:
»
» You’re not the franchise type. When you buy a franchise, you buy into an 
established system. If you’re the creative type who likes to experiment and 
change things, you may be an unhappy franchisee. Unlike starting your own 
business, where you can get into the game without investing lots of your time 
and money, buying a franchise that you end up not enjoying can make for an 
expensive learning experience.
»
» You may be locked in to buying overpriced supplies. Centralized, bulk 
purchasing through the corporate headquarters supposedly saves franchi-
sees time and money on supplies and other expenditures. Some franchisers, 
however, take advantage of franchisees through large markups on propri-
etary items that franchisees must buy from the franchisers.
»
» The franchise is unproven. If the company’s concept hasn’t stood the test of 
time, don’t make yourself a guinea pig. Some franchisers show more interest 
in simply selling franchises to collect the up-front franchise money. Reputable 
franchisers want to help their franchisees succeed so they can collect an 
ongoing royalty from the franchisees’ sales. In the worst cases, franchisers 
engage in fraud and sell next to nothing, except the hopes of getting rich quick.
Do your due diligence before you agree to buy a franchise. You may be tempted to 
cut corners when reviewing a franchise from a long-established company. Don’t. 
You may not be right for the specific franchise, or perhaps the “successful” com-
pany has mostly been good at keeping problems under wraps.
Beware the pitfalls of multilevel  
marketing companies
Franchises and multilevel marketing companies have some similarities: Both offer 
a prepackaged and defined system for running a business. Although both types 
may be worth your exploration, significant obstacles can trip you up, especially 
with multilevel marketing companies (MLM).
MLM companies, sometimes known as network companies, can be thought of as a 
poor person’s franchise. I know dozens of people, from clients I’ve worked with to 
students I’ve taught in my courses, who have been sorely disappointed with the 
money and time they’ve spent on MLM companies.

206      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
In companies that use multilevel marketing, representatives who work as inde-
pendent contractors recruit new representatives, known in the industry as your 
downline, as well as solicit customers. For those weary of traditional jobs, the 
appeal of multilevel marketing is obvious. You can work at home, part time if you 
want. You have no employees. You don’t need any experience. Yet you’re told you 
can still make big bucks ($10,000, $25,000, $50,000, or more per month).
A big problem to watch out for when dealing with MLM companies is the business 
equivalent of the pyramid scheme — businesses that exist to sign up other people. 
Beware of MLM companies that advocate the following: “Sell directly to those you 
have direct influence over. The system works great because you don’t need to 
resell month after month. It’s an opportunity for anybody; it’s up to that person 
how much work he wants to put into it.”
Think twice before you sign up relatives, friends, and co-workers. A danger in 
doing business with those people you have influence over is that you put your 
reputation and integrity on the line. You could be putting your friendships and 
family relations on the line as well.
The bottom line on any network marketing “opportunity” is to remember that it’s 
a job. No company is going to pay you a lot of money for little work. As with any 
other small-business venture, if you hope to earn a decent income, multilevel 
marketing opportunities require at least three to five years of low income to build 
up your business. Most people who pay to buy into networks make little money, 
and many quit and move on.
Any MLM company examination should start with the company’s product or ser-
vice. How does its product or service stack up to the competition on price and 
quality? Remember that due diligence requires digging for facts and talking to 
people who don’t have a bias or reason to sell to you. Contact the Better Business 
Bureau in the city where the MLM company is headquartered to see what kinds of 
complaints are on file. Be skeptical of multilevel marketing systems unless the 
company has a long track record and many people who are happy. In other words, 
assume that an MLM company isn’t worth pursuing until your extensive due dili-
gence proves otherwise.
Quality multilevel marketing companies are the exception and make sense for 
people who really believe in and want to sell a particular product or service and 
don’t want to or can’t tie up a lot of money buying a franchise or other business. 
Just remember to check out the MLM company and realize that you won’t get rich 
in a hurry — or probably ever.

Exploring Other 
Investment Vehicles
I
n the earlier chapters of this book, I present and discuss a pretty wide range of 
investments that are time-tested. You’ve probably already heard of and been 
pitched “other investments.” The vast majority of these alternative invest-
ments are flawed due to high fees, lousy performance, or worse.
In this chapter, I discuss the most common of these alternative investments: gold 
and other commodities, collectibles, and annuities and cash-value life insurance. 
In each case, I explain each investment’s redeeming qualities as well as its flaws.
Considering Gold and Other  
Precious Metals
Of all the commodities, gold and silver have gotten the most attention over time, 
especially in recent decades. Gold and silver are also known as precious metals.

208      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Gold and silver have served as mediums of exchange or currency over thousands 
of years because they have tangible value and can’t be debased the way that paper 
currencies can (by printing more money). These precious metals are used in 
­jewelry and manufacturing.
As investments, gold and silver perform well during bouts of inflation, especially 
when the inflation is unexpected. During the 1970s, for example, when inflation 
zoomed into the double-digit range in the United States and stocks and bonds 
went into the tank, gold and silver prices skyrocketed more than 500 percent.
Precious-metals prices have zoomed upward again since 2000. From less than 
$300 per ounce, gold hit more than $1,900 per ounce in the early 2010s, as some 
feared the return of inflation due to excessive government debt, government 
stimulus spending, and expansion of the printed money supply. During this 
period, silver jumped from just over $4 per ounce to a high of $45 per ounce. Since 
then, however, gold and silver have dropped dramatically in value.
Although precious metals may shine for a decade, over the long, long term, they’re 
lousy investments. They don’t pay any dividends, and their price increases may at 
best just keep up with, but not ahead of, increases in the cost of living. Consider 
the fact that even when gold breached $1,900 per ounce in 2011, it was still below 
the inflation-adjusted levels it reached more than 30 years ago. To reach those 
levels, gold would have to rise to more than $2,500 an ounce!
Although investing in precious metals is better than keeping cash in a piggy bank 
or stuffing it in a mattress, the long-term investment returns aren’t nearly as 
good as those of bonds, stocks, and real estate. One way to earn better long-term 
returns is to invest in a fund containing the stocks of gold and precious-metals 
companies.
One such fund to consider is the Vanguard Precious Metals and Mining fund (trad-
ing symbol VGPMX). This presents an interesting alternative to investing directly 
in precious metals. VGPMX invests in companies that benefit from increased 
demand for physical assets such as gold, other precious metals, and minerals.
Since the fund’s inception in 1984, it has returned approximately 4.5 percent per 
year versus about 3.6 percent per year for gold itself. Going forward, also consider 
the fact that gold pays no dividends. The Vanguard fund typically has a dividend 
yield of about 1 to 2 percent.
Be aware that VGPMX is quite volatile. That fact is borne out by the wide swings 
in the fund’s annual performance in absolute terms as well as within its peer 
group.

CHAPTER 15  Exploring Other Investment Vehicles      209
GOLD AND COLLECTIBLES DON’T  
GET FAVORABLE CAPITAL GAINS  
TAX TREATMENT
While gold and other precious metals have increased in value over the years, they’ve 
produced returns significantly below stocks and even bonds. And unbeknownst to most 
investors, the profits on precious metals aren’t eligible for the low 20-percent tax rate 
cap on long-term capital gains (for investments held more than one year). Collectibles, 
which includes precious metals, are taxed at 28 percent, which further reduces the sub-
par return on gold and other precious metals.
Historically, investors haven’t been allowed to own gold and other collectibles in retire-
ment accounts. However, investors in precious metals were happy to hear that in 2007, 
the IRS ruled that investors could own precious metal ETFs in retirement accounts since 
ETFs are shares of ownership and not a direct stake in a precious metal.
“This ruling hinges on the ETF being formed as a trust. The shareholders of the ETF do 
not have claims on the bullion owned by the fund and can’t ask for distributions of the 
metal,” says Bob Carlson, who publishes the Retirement Watch newsletter.
However, a more recent IRS ruling contained bad tax news for investors holding gold and 
other precious ETFs in taxable (nonretirement) accounts: “. . . If the investor sells shares in 
the ETF, the investor is treated as selling his or her share of the metal backing the shares. 
When the investor owned the shares for more than one year, the gains are taxed at the 
28 percent rate” rather than the lower long-term capital gains tax rate, says Carlson.
Of course, if you own the ETF in a retirement account, you lose all possible preferential 
capital gains tax treatment. Upon withdrawal from a retirement account, all profits are 
taxed as ordinary income.
Contemplating Collectibles
The term collectibles is a catch-all category for antiques, art, autographs of famous 
folks, baseball cards, clocks, coins, comic books, diamonds, dolls, gems, photo-
graphs, rare books, rugs, stamps, vintage wine, writing utensils, and a whole host 
of other items. In this section, I discuss the appeal and reality of investing in 
collectibles.

210      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Understanding the allure of collectibles
The best returns that collectibles investors reap come from the ability to identify, 
years in advance, items that will become popular. Do you think you can do that? 
You may be the smartest person in the world, but you should know that most 
dealers can’t tell what’s going to rocket to popularity in the coming decades.
Dealers make their profits the same way other retailers do — from the spread or 
markup on the merchandise they sell. The public and collectors have fickle, quirky 
tastes that no one can predict.
You can find out enough about a specific type of collectible to become a better 
investor than the average person, but you have to be among the best such collec-
tors to have a shot at earning decent returns. To get to this level of expertise, you 
need to invest hundreds, if not thousands, of hours reading, researching, and 
educating yourself about your specific type of collectible.
Don’t get me wrong: There’s nothing wrong with spending money on collectibles. 
Just don’t fool yourself into thinking that they’re investments (more on their 
actual returns in the next section). You can sink lots of your money into these 
non-income-producing, poor-return “investments.” At their best as investments, 
­collectibles give the wealthy a way to buy quality stuff that doesn’t depreciate.
Seeing the realities of collectibles  
and their returns
Although connoisseurs of fine art, antiques, and vintage wine wouldn’t like the 
comparison of their pastime with buying old playing cards, collectibles generally 
are objects with little intrinsic value. Wine is just a bunch of old, mushed-up 
grapes. A painting is simply a canvas and some paint that at retail would set you 
back a few bucks. Stamps are small pieces of paper, usually less than an inch 
square. What about baseball cards? Heck, my childhood friends and I used to stick 
them between our bike spokes (the crummiest players’ cards, of course)!
I’m not trying to diminish contributions that artists and others make to the 
world’s culture. And I know that some people place a high value on some of these 
collectibles. But true investments that can make your money grow  — such as 
stocks, real estate, or a small business — are assets that can produce income and 
profits.

SHOULD YOU INVEST IN BITCOIN AND 
OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES?
Perhaps you have heard of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. I find that far more young 
adults know about them than older folks do. That makes sense, because they’re digital 
currencies used for Internet transactions.
Bitcoin in particular has been making news more and more as its price climbs to dizzy-
ing heights. In early June 2017, the price of a bitcoin breached the $3,000 mark.
So what exactly is bitcoin? For starters, it’s not actually a coin; that’s a marketing gim-
mick to make it sound like a real currency. Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies exist 
only in the online world. Bitcoin’s creators have limited the number of bitcoins that can 
be mined and put into online circulation to about 21 million.
As its promoters have talked up its usefulness and meteoric rise, many people who 
have bitcoins continue to hold onto them in the hopes that the price will keep rising. Its 
owners and promoters are hoping for and expecting further steep price increases like 
shares of stock in the next Amazon.com or Apple. People don’t hoard real currencies 
with similar pie-in-sky hopes for large investment returns.
One problem is that bitcoin transactions can be done anonymously, and you can’t con-
test, dispute, or reverse them. So if you buy something using bitcoin and have a prob-
lem with the item, that’s too bad; you have no recourse — unlike, say, with a purchase 
made on your credit card. The clandestine nature of cryptocurrencies makes them 
attractive to folks trying to hide money or engage in illegal activities.
Another issue is that cryptocurrencies have no inherent value. Contrast that with gold. 
Gold not only has a long history of being used as a medium of exchange (currency) but 
also has commercial and industrial uses. Furthermore, gold costs real money to mine 
out of the ground, which provides a floor of support under the price of gold in the range 
of $800 to $900 per ounce, not far below the approximate $1,260-per-ounce price at the 
time of this writing.
Bitcoin is hardly unique; it’s one of hundreds of cryptocurrencies. If another cryptocur-
rency or two or three are easier to use online and perceived as attractive (in part 
because they’re far less expensive), bitcoin will tumble in value. China has recently said 
it isn’t going to allow such currencies to operate in its country. And in India, a country 
with more than one billion people, a new frictionless payment system — IndiaStack —  
threatens to unseat bitcoin.
(continued)

212      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Because collectibles have little inherent value, they’re fully exposed to the whims 
and speculations of buyers and sellers. As history has shown, of course, and as I 
discuss elsewhere in the book, the prices of particular stocks, real estate, and 
businesses can be subject to the whims and speculations of buyers and sellers, too, 
especially in the short term. Over the long term, however, securities’ market 
prices return to reality and sensible valuations. Also, a real investment can ­provide 
a return to you even if no one ever buys it from you.
Here are some other major problems with collectibles:
»
» Large markup costs: The spread between the price that a dealer pays for an 
object and the price for which he sells the same object is often around 100 
percent. Sometimes, the difference is even greater, particularly if a dealer is 
the second or third middleman in the chain of purchase. So at minimum, your 
purchase typically must double in value just to get you back to even, and a 
value may not double for 10 to 20 years or more!
»
» Substantial other costs: If the markups aren’t bad enough, some collectibles 
incur all sorts of other costs. If you buy more-expensive pieces, for example, 
you may need to have them appraised. You may have to pay storage and 
insurance costs as well. And unlike the case with markup, you pay some of 
these fees year after year of ownership.
»
» Costly mistakes of nonexpert buyers: Sometimes, you may overpay even 
more for a collectible because you didn’t realize some imperfection or 
inferiority of the item. Worse, you may buy a forgery. Even reputable dealers 
have been duped by forgeries. Also, you may make storage mistakes that 
cause your collectible to deteriorate over time. Damage from sunlight, 
humidity, temperatures that are too high or too low, and a whole host of 
vagaries can ruin the quality of your collectible. Insurance doesn’t cover this 
type of damage or negligence on your part.
Even though bitcoin has been the most popular cryptocurrency in recent years, few 
merchants actually accept it. And, to add insult to injury, bitcoin users get whacked  
with unfavorable conversion rates, which adds greatly to the effective price of items 
bought with it.
I can’t tell you what will happen to bitcoin’s price next month, next year, or next decade. 
But I can tell that it has virtually no inherent value as a digital currency, so those paying 
thousands of dollars for a bitcoin will eventually be very disappointed. There are nearly 
1,000 of these cryptocurrencies, and the field keeps growing as creators hope to get in 
on the ground floor of the next cryptocurrency they hope will soar in value. They actu-
ally have some things in common with collectibles.
(continued)

CHAPTER 15  Exploring Other Investment Vehicles      213
»
» Terrible returns: Even if you ignore the substantial costs of buying, holding, 
and selling, the average returns that investors earn from collectibles rarely 
keep ahead of inflation, and they’re generally inferior to returns from stocks, 
real estate, and small-business investing.
Objective return data on collectibles is hard to come by. Never, ever trust so-called 
“data” that dealers or the many collectibles trade publications provide.
Considering advice on buying collectibles
If you want to buy collectibles and can afford to do so, you have my blessing. Here 
are some tips to keep in mind to make the most of your efforts:
»
» Do your homework. Use a comprehensive resource to research, buy, sell, 
maintain, and improve your collectible, such as the books by Ralph and Terry 
Kovel or their website at www.kovels.com.
»
» Collect for your love of the collectible, your desire to enjoy it, or your 
interest in finding out about or mastering a subject. In other words, don’t 
collect these items because you expect high investment returns, because you 
probably won’t get them.
»
» When you know what you want, buy direct, and eliminate the middle-
man where possible. In some cases, you may be able to buy directly from 
the artist.
»
» Check collectibles that are comparable to the one you have your eye on, 
shop around, and don’t be afraid to negotiate. An effective way to negoti-
ate after you decide what you like is to make your offer to the dealer or artist 
by phone. Because the seller isn’t standing right next to you, you don’t feel 
pressure to decide immediately.
»
» Get a buy-back guarantee. Ask the dealer (who thinks that the item is such a 
great investment) for a written guarantee to buy the item back from you 
within five years, if you opt to sell it, for at least the same price you paid for it.
»
» Keep quality items that you and your family have purchased, and hope 
that someday they’ll be worth something. Keeping these quality items is 
the simplest way to break into the collectibles business. The complete sets of 
baseball cards I gathered as a youngster are now (30-plus years later) worth 
hundreds of dollars, and one is worth $1,000!

214      PART 4  Investing in Real Estate, Small Business, and Other Investments
Understanding Annuities and  
Cash-Value Life Insurance
Odds are that if you’re looking to make investments, you’ll be pitched various 
types of investment vehicles by folks who are licensed to sell insurance products. 
In this section, I discuss two of the most common vehicles: annuities and cash-
value life insurance.
Availing yourself of annuities
Annuities are contracts that insurance companies back. If you, the annuity holder 
(investor), should die during the so-called accumulation phase (before receiving 
payments from the annuity), your designated beneficiary is guaranteed reim-
bursement of the amount of your original investment.
Annuities, like Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), allow your capital to grow 
and compound tax-deferred. You defer taxes until you withdraw the money. 
Unlike with an IRA, which has an annual contribution limit of $5,500, you can 
deposit as much as you want into an annuity in any year — even millions of dol-
lars, if you’ve got them! As with a Roth IRA, however, you get no up-front tax 
deduction for your contributions.
The problem with annuities is that insurance agents try to sell them to many folks 
who won’t benefit from them — and the vast majority of folks won’t be in a posi-
tion to benefit from them.
If you’ve contributed all you’re allowed to contribute to your IRA and your 
employer’s retirement accounts, and you still want to put more money into retire-
ment accounts, you might consider annuities.
Don’t consider contributing to an annuity until you’ve fully exhausted your other 
retirement account investing options. The reason: Annuity contributions aren’t 
tax-deductible, and annuities carry higher annual operating fees to pay for the 
small amount of insurance that comes with them. Because of their higher annual 
expenses, annuities generally make sense only if you have 15 or more years to wait 
until you need the money.
Considering cash-value life insurance
If you have dependents, you may need life insurance. The key question to ask 
yourself and your family is how they would fare if you died and they no longer 

CHAPTER 15  Exploring Other Investment Vehicles      215
had your employment income. You need life insurance if your family is dependent 
on your income from work and would be unable to maintain its current standard 
of living with your passing.
Term life insurance is pure insurance protection and the best choice for the vast 
majority of people. The other major type of life insurance is cash-value coverage, 
which includes a life insurance death benefit (as does a term policy), as well as a 
savings and investment feature.
You generally can’t combine insurance with investing when you buy an auto, dis-
ability, or homeowner’s policy, so why can you with life insurance? You can thanks 
to an exemption in the tax code.
Insurance companies and agents who sell their products and earn commissions 
favor cash-value life insurance. The reasons are pretty simple: Cash-value life 
insurance costs much more and provides heftier profits for insurance companies 
and commissions to the agents who sell it.
You should consider getting cash-value life insurance only if your net worth is 
high enough that you anticipate having an estate-planning “problem.” When you 
buy a cash-value policy and place it in an irrevocable life insurance trust, the 
death benefits can pass to your heirs free of federal estate taxes.
Under current tax law, you can leave up to $5.49 million free of federal estate 
taxes to your heirs. If you’re married, you can pass on double these amounts 
through the use of a bypass trust. So most people don’t have an estate-planning 
situation that warrants cash-value life insurance.

Ten Things to Know 
about Investing 
Resources
E
verywhere you look or listen, you’ll find plenty — and I mean plenty — of 
investing opinions and advice. Some of it may be great information but not a 
good fit for you. Much of it is mediocre or downright awful, biased, unin-
formed, and misleading.
In this chapter, I highlight ten important things you should know and do to evalu-
ate investing resources and get the best and right information for you.
Get Educated to Discern  
the Best from the Rest
With the tremendous increase in the coverage of investing, more and more 
“­journalists” and self-anointed experts are writing about increasingly technical 
issues — often in areas in which they have little or even no expertise. (This type 

220      PART 5  The Part of Tens
of reporting is true in traditional print publications but especially so online.) Some 
writers provide good information and advice. Unfortunately, many others dish out 
bad, biased and/or mediocre advice.
How can you know what information is good and whom you can trust? Although I 
suggest my favorite resources later in this chapter, I know you’ll encounter many 
investment resources, and you need to know how to tell the best from the rest. 
The answer rests in educating yourself. The more knowledgeable you are about 
sound and flawed investment strategies, the better able you are to tell good from 
not-so-good investment resources.
Beware “Free”
Too many folks get suckered into supposedly free resources when looking for 
investing information and advice. The Internet is filled with tons of “free” invest-
ing websites and blogs, and if you turn on your television or radio, you come 
across mountains of “free” stuff. Someone is paying for all this “free” content, of 
course, and it’s all available for some reason.
Most of the free Internet sites are run by investment companies or someone else 
(such as small-time money managers) with something to sell. What these sites 
give away is nothing but subtle and not-so-subtle advertising for whatever prod-
ucts and services they sell. Also, watch out for free sites that make money through 
referrals. Affiliates are companies that provide referral fees and income for busi-
ness that websites direct their way, and such payments create major conflicts of 
interest for the websites. For that reason, a website shouldn’t receive affiliate fees 
when recommending a financial product or service.
Many investing books also contain thinly veiled advertisements. Some so-called 
authors choose to write books that are the equivalent of infomercials for some-
thing else — such as high-priced seminars — that they really want to sell you. 
Such writers aren’t interested in educating and helping you as much as they’re 
seeking to sell you something else. So, for example, an author may write about 
how complicated the investing markets are, saying that investing is too compli-
cated to do on your own and that you really need a personal investment manager 
like the author.

CHAPTER 16  Ten Things to Know about Investing Resources      221
Understand the Influence of Advertising
Whether on the Internet, on television, in print, or on the radio, advertising often 
compromises the quality of the investment advice it accompanies. I won’t say that 
you can’t find some useful investment resources in media with lots of advertising. 
These resources, however, are exceptions to the rule that sources with lots of 
advertising contain little valuable information and advice.
Many organizations, such as newspaper and magazine publishing companies and 
radio and television stations that accept ads, say that their ad departments are 
separate from their editorial departments. The truth, however, is that in most of 
these organizations, advertisers wield influence over the content. At minimum, 
the editorial environments at these organizations must be perceived as being con-
ducive to the sale of the advertisers’ products.
Another problem is the merging of editorial and advertising content into adverto-
rials, whereby a company or person pays a fee to a website to place provided con-
tent that’s really an ad in disguise. This practice is unethical, especially when it 
isn’t clearly and boldly disclosed.
The influence of advertisers prevents readers, viewers, and listeners from getting 
the truth and best advice. Specifically, some media organizations and publishers 
simply won’t make derogatory comments about advertisers, and sometimes they 
highlight and praise investment companies that are big advertisers.
Value Quality over Quantity
Talk about information overload! Blogs on the topic of investing continue to 
multiply. You can’t peruse a newspaper or magazine or turn on the television or 
radio without bumping into articles, stories, segments, and entire programs 
devoted to investment issues.
The Internet introduced a whole new medium. Now, at a relatively low cost, ­anyone 
can publish “content” online. The number of television channels has mushroomed 
as a result of cable television. Flip through your cable channels at any hour of the 
day, and you see infomercials that promise to make you a real estate tycoon or 
stock market millionaire in your spare time. These communications options are 
primarily structured around selling advertising rather than offering quality con-
tent. The accessibility of these communications media allows just about anyone 
with an animated personality or access to a computer to appear to be an expert. 
Much of the advice out there can easily steer you in the wrong direction.

222      PART 5  The Part of Tens
Because investment information and advice is so widespread and constantly 
growing, knowing how to sift through it is just as important as hearing what the 
best resources are today. When chosen wisely, the best investing resources can 
further your investment knowledge and enable you to make better decisions. 
Quality is more important than quantity. Later in this chapter, I name the best 
investment resources that I’m familiar with.
Know How to Check Out a Resource
The best thing to do when you encounter a financial magazine, website, blog, 
radio or television program, or other resource for the first time is scrutinize it.
All things being equal, you have a greater chance of finding quality content when 
subscriber fees account for the bulk of a company’s revenue and advertising 
accounts for little or none of the revenue. This generalization, of course, is just 
that: a generalization. Some publications that derive a reasonable portion of their 
revenue from advertising have some good columns and content. Conversely, some 
relatively ad-free sources aren’t very good.
Deciphering a writer’s philosophy and agenda is important in determining 
whether he provides quality information. Readers of my books, for example, can 
clearly understand my philosophies about investing. I advocate buying and hold-
ing, not trading and gambling. I explain how to build wealth through proven vehi-
cles, including stocks, real estate, and small-business ownership.
Unfortunately, many publications and programs don’t make it as easy for you to 
see or hear their operating beliefs. You have to do some homework. With a radio 
program, for example, you probably have to listen to at least portions of several 
shows to get a sense of the host’s investment philosophies.
Examine the backgrounds, including professional work experience and education 
credentials, of a resource’s writers, hosts, or anchors. If such information isn’t 
given or easily found, consider this omission to be a red flag. People who have 
something to hide or who lack solid credentials usually don’t promote their back-
grounds. Also, don’t blindly accept presented qualifications as being honest or 
truthful.
Other red flags include publications and programs that make investing sound 
overly complicated and that imply — or say outright — that you won’t succeed or 
do as well if you don’t hire a financial advisor or follow your investments like 
a hawk.

CHAPTER 16  Ten Things to Know about Investing Resources      223
Beware Hype and Exaggeration
There’s an old news-media expression that says, “If it bleeds, it leads.” Transla-
tion: Jarring, violent, or blood-and-gore stories attract attention.
Too often, this is the case in financial reporting too. If the stock market drops 
quickly or there’s a disappointing economic report, you’re sure to hear about it 
over and over again. Ditto for political scandals.
I’m not suggesting that only good news be reported. But frequently, negative 
events are blown out of proportion and hyped to garner more attention. Don’t get 
carried away by the hype or be misled into believing that much of this short-term 
news should impact your important and longer-term investing decisions.
Don’t Assume Quoted Experts  
Know Their Stuff
Historically, one way that investment journalists have attempted to overcome 
technical gaps in their knowledge has been to interview and quote experts in the 
field. Although these quotes may add to the accuracy and quality of a story, jour-
nalists who aren’t experts themselves often have difficulty discerning qualified 
experts from hacks.
One common example of this phenomenon is that many investment writers quote 
unproven advice from investment-newsletter writers. As I discuss later in this 
chapter, the predictive advice of many newsletter writers is often poor, causing 
investors to earn lower returns and miss investment gains due to frequent 
­trading. Journalists who simply parrot this type of information and provide an 
endorsement that unqualified sources are “experts” do readers an immense 
disservice.
Investigate Gurus’ Claims
The tremendous growth in the number of people talking and writing about 
investing on websites, on cable television, and on radio means that more pundits 
are making claims about the value of their predictions. Unfortunately, many 

224      PART 5  The Part of Tens
publications and media outlets that interview and give air time to these pundits 
fail to independently investigate most such claims.
You don’t need predictions and soothsayers to make sound investing choices. If 
you choose to follow this “expert” advice and you’re lucky, little harm will be 
done. But more often than not, you can lose lots of money by following a pundit’s 
predictions.
Never accept a guru’s performance claims as valid. These claims should always be 
verified through an independent source. Visit the “Guru Watch” section of my 
website, www.erictyson.com, for analysis of many of the popular gurus in the 
media today.
Don’t Believe Investment- 
Newsletter Claims
Especially in the investment-newsletter business, you’ll see and hear lots of 
extraordinary performance claims. Private money managers, who aren’t subject to 
the same scrutiny and auditing requirements as fund managers, can do the same.
Be especially wary of any newsletters making claims of high returns. According to 
the Hulbert Financial Digest, the worst investment newsletters have underper-
formed the market averages by dozens of percentage points; some would even 
have caused you to lose money during decades when the financial markets 
­performed extraordinarily well (like the 1980s and 1990s).
Also be aware that plenty of gurus and newsletters will tout many strategies, 
investments, and funds, and then continue to hype only the one or two that hap-
pen to do well. The strategy or back-tested model may in fact have a good track 
record over a given period, but it may be cherry-picked and unlikely to succeed in 
the future.
Don’t believe a track record unless a reputable accounting firm with experience 
doing such audits has audited it. Stay far away from publications that purport to 
be able to tell what’s going to happen next. No one has a crystal ball.

Ten Essential Tips for 
Investing Success
I
nvesting appears to be complicated and complex. But if you can take some rela-
tively simple concepts to heart and adhere to them, you can greatly increase 
your success.
In this chapter, I present my ten favorite, time-tested principles of investing suc-
cess. Following these principles will pay you big dividends (and capital gains) for 
many years to come.
Regularly Save and Invest 5 Percent 
to 10 Percent of Your Income
Unless you enjoy a large inheritance, you should consistently save 5 percent to 
10 percent of the money you’re earning. When should you start doing this? I say, 
as soon as you begin earning money on a regular basis.

228      PART 5  The Part of Tens
Preferably, invest through a retirement savings account to reduce your taxes and 
ensure your future financial independence. You can reduce both your current fed-
eral and state income tax bills (on the contributions) as well as these ongoing bills 
(on the investment earnings).
The exact portion of your income you should be saving is driven by your goals and 
by your current financial assets and liabilities. Take the time to crunch some 
numbers to determine how much you should be saving monthly.
Understand and Use Your 
Employee Benefits
The larger the employer, the more likely it is to offer avenues for you to invest 
conveniently through payroll deduction, and with possible tax benefits and dis-
counts. Some companies enable you to buy company stock at a reduced price.
Often, the most valuable benefit you have is a retirement savings plan, such as a 
401(k) plan that enables you to make contributions and save on your current 
income taxation. Also, after the money is in the account, it can compound and 
grow over the years and decades without taxation.
If you’re self-employed, be sure to establish and use a retirement plan (see 
Chapter 2). Also take time to learn about the best investment options available to 
you — and use them.
Thoroughly Research Before You Invest
The allure of large expected returns too often is the enticement that gets novices 
hooked on a particular investment. That’s a whole lot more appealing than 
researching an investment. But research you must if you want to make an informed 
decision.
Be sure you understand what you’re investing in. Don’t purchase any financial 
product that you don’t understand. Ask questions, and compare what you’re being 
offered with the best sources I recommend. Beware of purchasing an investment 
on the basis of an advertisement or a salesperson’s solicitation.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Essential Tips for Investing Success      229
Shun Investments with High Commissions 
and Expenses
The cost of the investments you buy is an important variable you can control.  
All fees must be disclosed in a prospectus, which you should always review before 
making any investment.
Companies that sell their investment products through aggressive sales tech-
niques generally have the worst financial products and the highest fees and 
commissions.
Invest the Majority of Your Long-Term 
Money in Ownership Investments
When you’re young, you have plenty of time to let your investments compound 
and grow. Likewise, you have time to recover from setbacks.
So with your long-term money, focus on investments that have appreciation 
potential, such as stocks, real estate, and your own business. When you invest in 
bonds or bank accounts, you’re simply lending your money to others and will earn 
a return that probably won’t keep you ahead of inflation and taxes.
Avoid Making Emotionally Based  
Financial Decisions
Successful investors keep their composure when the going gets tough. You need 
the ability and wisdom to look beyond the current environment, understanding 
that it will change in the months and years ahead.
You don’t want to panic and sell your stock holdings after a major market correc-
tion, for example. In fact, you should consider such an event to be a buying oppor-
tunity for stocks. Be especially careful about making important financial decisions 
after a major life change, such as marriage, the birth of a child, a divorce, job loss, 
or a death in your family.

230      PART 5  The Part of Tens
Make Investing Decisions Based  
on Your Plans and Needs
Your investment decisions should come out of your planning and your overall 
needs, goals, and desires. This requires looking at your overall financial situation 
first and then coming up with a comprehensive plan.
Don’t be swayed and influenced by the predictive advice offered by various invest-
ment pundits or the latest news headlines and concerns. Trust that you know 
yourself and your financial situation better than anyone else does.
Tap Information Sources with  
High Quality Standards
You need to pare down the sources you use to keep up with investing news and the 
financial markets. Give priority to those that aren’t afraid to take a stand and rec-
ommend what’s in your best interests.
I don’t have a problem with opinion shows that are clearly labeled as such. The 
public clearly has an appetite for some of them; on the political left, you have 
programs on CNN and MSNBC. On the political right, FOX has some popular con-
servative opinion shows. I’m not suggesting that you or anyone else should watch 
or like such programs.
Political partisans distort the news rather than report the news, and they prevent 
you from better understanding what’s really going on so you can make informed 
decisions. Political partisans overstate the impact that the president and others 
can have over our economy and financial markets.
Stay away from outlets that cater to advertisers or are driven by an ideological 
agenda.
Trust Yourself First
Look in the mirror. You’ll see the best financial person you can hire and trust. 
What may be missing is enough education and confidence to make more and bet-
ter decisions on your own, which this book can assist you with doing.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Essential Tips for Investing Success      231
If you need help making a major decision, hire conflict-free advisors who charge 
a fee for their time. Work in partnership with advisors. Never turn over or abdicate 
control.
Invest in Yourself and Others
Don’t get so wrapped up in making, saving, and investing money that you lose 
sight of what matters most to you. Invest in your education, your health, and your 
relationships with family members and friends.
Having a lot of money isn’t worth much if you don’t have your health and people 
with whom to share your life. Give your time and money to causes that better our 
society and our world.

Ten Things to Know 
about Investing Apps
M
ost apps are offered by existing larger companies as another option for 
their customers to connect to and interact with what they offer. And, of 
course, companies would love for you to use their apps so they can con-
tinue to promote themselves to you and ensure that you remain a loyal customer. 
The investment companies you do business with — banks, mutual fund compa-
nies, brokerage firms, and so on — are no exception.
That said, you can also find some apps offered by smaller, start-up companies 
that solely exist online and perhaps even only as an app. You don’t need me to tell 
you that you should be skeptical and extremely careful with such enterprises, for 
reasons I discuss later in this chapter.
Over time, the best new firms emerge and help improve the overall financial land-
scape and your options. But I don’t want you to be some small company’s guinea 
pig. Given the choice between a start-up and a longer-standing, proven, success-
ful investment company with good customer service, I bet you can guess which 
one will get my investment dollars.
With that as background, in this chapter, I offer advice for how to make the most 
out of using investing related apps and sidestep common app pitfalls and prob-
lems, as well as providing a short list of the best investment apps I’ve reviewed.

234      PART 5  The Part of Tens
Beware of the General Dangers of Putting 
Apps on Your Cellphone
Computer viruses, malware, and ransomware attacks have garnered more atten-
tion, but similar problems occur with smartphone apps. The worst of the lot can 
end up tracking and spying on you. Some are a scam and/or some sort of virus or 
malware.
Even if an app doesn’t have these nefarious issues, you should also check out the 
background and agenda of any company offering an investment-related app and 
understand how such companies may be making money from the app. Most apps 
are nothing more than glorified advertising from the company behind the app. 
Sure, the product may dangle something seemingly helpful (such as free stock 
quotes), but ultimately you need to uncover what the provider’s agenda, track 
record, and reputation are.
Do your research on an app before downloading and beginning to use one. Check 
with more than one independent source and read independent reviews, especially 
those which are critical and less than flattering.
Use Apps Only from Proven Companies 
with Good Reputations and Longevity
Most of the companies I recommend in this chapter are fairly large companies 
with lengthy track records of success. For sure, technology is disrupting and 
changing many industries and companies. But that doesn’t mean you should only 
do business with firms that exist solely online, in the cloud, and so on.
First, such companies are far more likely to be here today but gone tomorrow. 
Second, if you need actual customer service — such as talking with a real live 
person by phone — some of these newfangled firms simply don’t provide such 
contact options. They may only offer email, which isn’t ideal for resolving nuanced 
or mildly complicated problems. Finally, start-ups by definition lack a long-term 
proven track record.
Research the history of companies that you’re considering doing business with. 
Download apps directly from the company’s website so you’re sure you’re getting 
their actual app rather than a knock-off or a fraudulent one.

CHAPTER 18  Ten Things to Know about Investing Apps      235
Consider the Alternatives to an App
Before downloading and using an app, you should question the need for it and 
consider the alternatives. Remember that the company behind the app wants to tie 
you to its company so you do more business with it. Is that your goal?
You likely have your phone with you all the time. Do you really want this app run-
ning and in your face all the time? Maybe, maybe not — think about it and exam-
ine the alternatives. Getting constantly changing investment prices on your phone 
every hour or every day isn’t going to make you a better investor.
Use the Best Personal Finance Apps 
to Have More to Invest
Unless you’ve been fortunate to earn a lot of money in a short period of time, 
received a large inheritance, or won the lottery, you likely want more money to 
invest. Some folks need extra help and hand-holding to lick the problem of over-
spending, and some simply want to feel on top of where their money goes and do 
something constructive about it. Many websites and related apps purport to 
address this problem, but in reality they have massive conflicts of interest through 
the affiliate relationships (that is, kickbacks) they have with companies that they 
direct business to. Advertising is also a common problem.
Some apps to date have overcome these problems, but things can change, so don’t 
take my current recommendation in this space as a forever endorsement. That 
said, here are a few good options right now:
»
» I like the Goodbudget app for its simplicity and practicality. The basic version 
provides you with up to one year of spending-tracking history in 10 main 
categories (envelopes). A paid or premium version ($45 per year) gives you up 
to five years of expense tracking with unlimited categories as well as email 
support. I suggest starting with the free version and then deciding later 
whether an upgrade is worth your while.
»
» Some apps are simply designed to save you money. GasBuddy, for example, 
shows you the price for gasoline at various service stations in a local area. It’s 
free for consumers to use.
»
» Especially when you’re going on lengthy car trips, car tolls can add up quickly. 
The Tollsmart Toll Calculator app is a low-cost app that enables you to 
compare toll costs for alternative routes. The Waze app can help with 

236      PART 5  The Part of Tens
navigating traffic. Somebody should really combine a navigation app with the 
information from a toll app so drivers can select routes that save time and 
money!
»
» CamelCamelCamel is a price tracker that scans items on Amazon, shows you 
their price history, and sends you alerts when a product you’re interested in 
drops in price. PriceGrabber scans items everywhere online, although its 
website is much easier to use than its app is.
Be Skeptical of Investing Apps 
Offering “Free” Trading
Thanks to deregulation decades ago, and now technology, brokerage trading fees 
have dropped dramatically. Many leading investment companies that I highlight 
elsewhere in this book offer broad menus of the best investments (for example, 
mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, stocks, bonds, and so on). I explain in this 
book how to buy many of the funds without any trading fees at all, and when fees 
are levied, they’re typically quite low.
But that hasn’t stopped some folks from trying to offer even better deals. Hence, 
the rise of some brokerage firms claiming “free” trading. Of course, there’s a 
catch — a brokerage firm can’t possibly exist, let alone survive, if it doesn’t charge 
any fees at all for any of its services.
One such company offering “free” brokerage trades had many many catches when 
I researched what it offers:
»
» It exists only as an app, so you can’t access the company through a traditional 
desktop display or through a web-based version.
»
» If you need customer service or help resolving a problem on your account, 
you have limited access to phone assistance, and then only during normal 
business hours. After hours, including on weekends, you’re stuck using email.
»
» You can only use the app for taxable accounts; it doesn’t offer retirement 
accounts like an IRA.
»
» It also doesn’t offer mutual funds.
»
» You can’t tap into any tools or research.

CHAPTER 18  Ten Things to Know about Investing Apps      237
»
» If you want or need a paper statement of your account, it will cost you $5 each 
time you request it.
»
» Should you decide to close your account and have it transferred to another 
broker, you get to pay $75 for the privilege of leaving.
There are no free lunches in the investment world. And I wouldn’t recommend 
any of the “free” brokerage trading platforms/apps I have reviewed to date. They 
simply have too many deficiencies and drawbacks, and they won’t actually save 
you money in the long run compared with the best investment and brokerage 
firms I recommend in this book.
Review Current and Historic Financial 
and Economic Data
The St. Louis Fed’s signature economic database  — FRED, which stands for 
Federal Reserve Economic Database — is accessible through an app. Here’s a rare 
case where you can have a wealth of data at your fingertips and not be bombarded 
with ads or plugs to buy things.
Are you curious how the latest unemployment rate compares with prior years and 
decades? Would you like to see how corporate profits stack up now compared with 
past economic cycles? How about understanding what the “financial stress index” 
is and how it has changed in recent months and years? You can see all this data 
and much much more on the St. Louis FRED website.
Invest with Leading Fund Providers
Of course, many banks, investment companies, brokers, and so on have apps. So 
if you have a favorite investment firm or bank, check out what it offers. For its 
broad array of cost effective funds with solid long-term performance, I use 
Vanguard’s app.
In addition to Vanguard, other major fund companies with quality offerings and 
apps include T. Rowe Price and Fidelity.

238      PART 5  The Part of Tens
Tap into the Best Investment 
Brokerage Firms
Check out the apps offered by leading investment brokerage firms recommended 
in this book, such as ETrade, TD Ameritrade, Scottrade, and Charles Schwab. Also 
remember that the leading fund companies mentioned in the preceding section 
also have discount brokerage operations.
Examine the Best Real Estate Apps
If you’re looking for a home or basic types of investment real estate, the Real 
Estate App from realtor.com has the most comprehensive and up-to-date collec-
tion of listings. It includes a mapping feature that enables you to specify specific 
areas in which you want to see the homes for sale. Also, you can detail specific 
features of a home that interest you. If you’re still a renter, realtor.com also has 
an easy to use Rentals App.
Seek out Good Small-Business Apps
You can find lots of apps for small business. Among the better ones I’ve reviewed 
are the QuickBooks App and the Wave Accounting App for small businesses (not to 
be confused with the Waze app I mention earlier in the chapter for trip navigation). 
I also like Dropbox, a cloud-based service for storing and sharing documents, 
files, photos, videos, and so on.

The Lowdown on 
Health Insurance
W
hen you’re young and living under your parents’ roof, you’re unlikely 
to be concerned with health insurance. School-aged kids generally get 
their health insurance through a parent’s coverage, a practice that’s 
usually continued through college.
Welcome to the young-adult world of health insurance! Health insurance was in 
the news soon after the election of President Barack Obama in 2008 because he 
promised during the campaign, and then pushed for, a national health insurance 
program mandated by the federal government.
Health insurance was front and center once again during the 2016 Presidential 
election. Candidate Donald Trump promised over and over again that he would 
“repeal and replace” Obamacare with “something so much better.” Once elected, 
President Trump soon discovered that the U.S. healthcare and health insurance 
industries are much more complicated than he realized, as is getting members of 
Congress to agree on a specific repeal-and-replace plan. “Now, I have to tell you, 
it’s an unbelievably complex subject . . . Nobody knew healthcare could be so com-
plicated,” President Trump said in his second month in office.

I could have told Mr. Trump that the healthcare industry and reforming it is 
complicated  — but he didn’t ask me! In fact, I’ve had involvement with and 
interest in the healthcare and insurance industry since my first professional job 
after college as a management consultant. Most young adults are fortunate to not 
be big consumers of healthcare. But, because you never know what the future 
holds and people of all ages should get checkups and preventative care, this 
chapter discusses the best and most affordable ways to secure health insurance in 
your 20s and 30s. I also cover the ramifications of the healthcare bill that was 
signed into law in 2010 and what may be coming in the Trump administration.
Making Sure You’re Covered
Having health insurance is essential for nearly everyone, no matter your age. 
Many people get health insurance through their employers. Unfortunately, plenty 
of people don’t have coverage. In fact, studies estimate that about one in five folks 
in their 20s lack health insurance coverage.
Historically, some people who can afford health insurance choose not to buy it 
because they believe they’re healthy and they’re not going to need it. Others who 
opt not to buy health insurance figure that if they ever really need healthcare, 
they’ll get it even if they can’t fully afford it.
Although you may think you’re healthy and don’t need health insurance, think 
again. People without health insurance are more prone to put off getting routine 
and preventative care, which can lead to small problems turning into big ones. 
Besides this being an unwise approach to optimizing your health, it often costs 
more because of advanced illness, emergency room visits, and so on.
This section discusses transitioning from your parents’ coverage to your own and 
how the healthcare laws help you get coverage.
Transitioning your coverage
Each state once had its own laws as far as health insurance coverage went, so 
there was no one-size-fits-all approach. In the past in most states, an adult child 
generally lost health insurance coverage under a parent’s policy upon college 
graduation or when turning a particular age (for example, 25 or 26). Each state 
had a unique set of laws. Consider, for example, three state rules I pulled at 
random:

BONUS CHAPTER  The Lowdown on Health Insurance      243
»
» Connecticut required that group comprehensive and health insurance policies 
extend coverage to unwed children until the age of 26, provided they 
remained residents of Connecticut or were full-time students.
»
» Florida allowed for dependent children up to age 25 who lived with a parent 
or were students, and those up to 30 who were also unmarried and had no 
dependent children of their own, to remain on their parents’ insurance.
»
» Wyoming allowed a child who was unmarried and a full-time student to 
remain on a parent’s insurance up to age 23 if the parent was covered by a 
small group policy.
What a headache! And then the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, 
was passed in 2010 so states had to amend their approach to conform with Obam-
acare’s requirements — detailed in the next section. (At the time this book goes to 
press in late 2017, it is unclear what, if any, changes may be coming out of the new 
Congress and President.)
So what are the best ways to negotiate keeping health insurance coverage in your 
20s without spending a small fortune for coverage? Here’s my advice:
»
» Consider staying on your parents’ policy until you secure full-time 
employment. As soon as you’re eligible for your employer’s health plan, 
sign up for it.
»
» If you don’t have access to your own coverage through your employer, 
look to COBRA. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 
(COBRA) enables you to stay on your parents’ policy for up to 18 months from 
the time you lose coverage on that policy. Just be aware that you have to pay 
the full premiums.
»
» If you’re self-employed, or your employer doesn’t offer health coverage,  
or the coverage isn’t very good, get your own policy with a high deductible. 
A deductible is the amount of medical claims you must first pay out of your 
pocket before insurance coverage kicks in. Check out the later section “Finding 
Your Best Health Plan” for advice. You can then sock money away in a health 
savings account (HSA) if you desire. See the section on HSAs later in this 
chapter.
Seeing how the 2010 healthcare laws 
(Obamacare) changed your coverage
In 2010, Congress passed, and President Obama signed, two comprehensive health-
care reform bills that affect how you can get health insurance coverage. 

244      Personal Finance in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
Summarizing thousands of pages of legislation in a concise space is challenging, but 
the reality is that the highlights that apply to young adults aren’t that extensive.
Obamacare implemented the following changes to group health plans offered 
through employers:
»
» They must offer coverage to their employees for their adult children up to 
age 26 who aren’t eligible for coverage under another employer’s health plan. 
So if your mother or father is covered under a group health plan, you may get 
coverage through that plan through age 26, even if you aren’t a dependent for 
income tax purposes. The coverage isn’t taxable to the employee or 
dependent.
»
» They may not impose lifetime limits on claims paid (annual limits became 
prohibited as of 2014).
»
» Employers must offer minimum coverage to full-time employees or make 
payments to the government.
»
» Group health plans must limit cost sharing and deductibles to those in a 
health savings account–eligible, high-deductible health plan.
»
» Group health plans must remove all preexisting-condition exclusions on all 
participants.
Higher-income earners are subjected to some higher taxes to help pay for the 
health bill:
»
» Single taxpayers with earned income above $200,000 and married couples 
filing jointly with earned income above $250,000 pay an extra 0.9 percent 
Medicare tax on wages and self-employment income in excess of these 
thresholds.
»
» Taxpayers with modified adjusted income (MAGI) from any source (including 
investments) above these thresholds are subject to a 3.8 percent tax on the 
lesser of their net investment income (for example, interest, dividends, and 
capital gains) and the amount by which their modified adjusted gross income 
exceeds the thresholds.
Trumpcare?
At the time that this book went to press in late 2017, the new Congress and 
President Trump had been working to repeal and replace Obamacare but hadn’t 

BONUS CHAPTER  The Lowdown on Health Insurance      245
made any progress. A more probable outcome could be modifying Obamacare 
rather than repealing and replacing it, but only time will tell.

Finding Your Best Health Plan
Most working-age folks obtain health insurance through their employer. 
Employer-provided coverage eliminates the hassle of having to shop for coverage 
from scratch. Also, thanks to the purchasing power of a group, employer-provided 
coverage may provide a higher level of benefits, given the cost, than individually 
purchased coverage.
If you’re self-employed, out of work, or working for an employer that doesn’t 
offer health coverage, you need to shop for and secure health insurance. And even 
if your employer does offer health policies, you may well have choices to make. In 
the following sections, I discuss the important issues to consider when selecting 
among available health insurance plans.
Selection of doctors and hospitals
Open-choice plans that allow you to use any doctor or hospital you want are less 
common and generally more expensive than restricted-choice plans, such as health 
maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). 
These plans keep costs down because they negotiate low rates with selected 
providers.
HMOs and PPOs are more similar than they are different. The main difference is 
that PPOs still pay the majority of your expenses if you use a provider outside their 
approved list. If you use a provider outside the approved list with an HMO, you 
typically aren’t covered at all.
If you want to use particular doctors or hospitals, find out which health insurance 
plans they accept as payment. Weigh whether the extra cost of an open-choice 
plan is worth being able to use the services of particular medical providers if 
they’re not part of a restricted-choice plan. Also be aware that some plans allow 
you to go outside their network of providers as long as you pay a bigger portion of 
the incurred medical costs. If you’re interested in using alternative types of pro-
viders, such as acupuncturists, find out whether the plans you’re considering 
cover these services.

246      Personal Finance in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
Plan benefits and features
Healthcare plans typically offer many bells and whistles. The following identifies 
the key features to search for to ensure a quality plan at the most reasonable cost:
»
» Major medical coverage: This includes hospital care, physician visits, and 
ancillary charges, such as X-rays and laboratory work. If you’re a woman and 
you think you may want to have children, make sure your plan has mater-
nity benefits.
»
» Deductibles and co-payments: To reduce your health insurance premiums, 
choose a plan with the highest deductible and co-payment (the amount you pay 
when service is rendered, such as $10 to $30) you can afford. As with other 
insurance policies, the more you’re willing to share in the cost of your claims, 
the less you’ll have to pay in premiums. Most policies have annual deductible 
options (usually $250, $500, $1,000, or higher) as well as co-payment options, 
which are typically 20 percent or so of the claim amount. With the passage of 
Obamacare and plans compatible with health savings accounts, many plans 
have a deductible of several thousand dollars. Insurance plans generally set a 
maximum out-of-pocket limit such as $1,000 or $2,000 on your annual 
co-payments. The insurer covers 100 percent of any medical expenses that go 
over that cap. Many HMO plans don’t have deductible and co-payment 
options.
If you have existing health problems and you have a choice of group plans 
through your employer, consider plans with low out-of-pocket expenses. 
Because you’re part of a group, the insurer won’t increase your individual 
rates just because you file more claims.
»
» Lifetime maximum benefits: Health insurance plans specify the maximum 
total benefits they’ll pay over the course of time you’re insured by their plan. 
The national health insurance bill signed into law in 2010 prevents insurers 
from setting lifetime maximums. Should Obamacare be modified or repealed, 
keep in mind that with the high cost of healthcare, you should choose a plan 
that has no maximum or that has a maximum of at least $5 million. See the 
section “Seeing how the 2010 healthcare laws (Obamacare) changed your 
coverage” earlier in this chapter.
Shopping for Health Insurance
Yes, health insurance is among the more complicated things to shop for, but it’s 
like other products and services — there’s a marketplace of providers competing 
for your business. This section explains how to unearth your best options and 
what to do in case you’re ever denied coverage in the future.

BONUS CHAPTER  The Lowdown on Health Insurance      247
Uncovering the best policies
When shopping for health insurance, you basically have two options: You can buy 
a health plan through an agent or you can buy directly from an insurer. When 
particular health insurance plans are sold both ways, buying through an agent 
usually doesn’t cost more.
Obamacare provided a new way in some states to buy health insurance — through 
state-based exchanges. Whether these continue depends on what Congress and 
President Trump can agree to. As of the publication of this book in late 2017, most 
state-based exchanges continue to operate.
If you’re self-employed or you work for a smaller employer that doesn’t offer 
health insurance as a benefit, get proposals from the larger and older health 
insurers in your area. Larger plans can negotiate better rates from providers, and 
older plans are more likely to be here tomorrow. Nationally, Blue Cross Blue 
Shield, Kaiser Permanente, Aetna, UnitedHealth, CIGNA, Assurant, and Anthem 
are among the older and bigger health insurers.
Many insurers operate in a bunch of different insurance businesses. You want an 
insurer that’s one of the biggest in the health insurance arena and is committed 
to, understands, and has more experience in that business. If your coverage is 
canceled, you may have to search for new coverage if the law continues nationally 
that mandates coverage for folks with an existing medical problem.
Before the passage of Obamacare, which included requiring coverage for everyone 
with pre-existing conditions, many states offered coverage for those folks. (Check 
out the next section for more info.)
Also check with professional or other associations that you belong to, as such 
plans sometimes offer decent benefits at a competitive price because of the pur-
chasing clout they possess. A competent independent insurance agent who spe-
cializes in health insurance can help you find insurers who are willing to offer you 
coverage.
Health insurance agents have a conflict of interest that’s common to all financial 
salespeople who work on commission: The higher the premium plan they sell you, 
the bigger the commission they earn. So an agent may try to steer you into higher-
cost plans and avoid suggesting some of the cost-reducing strategies that I discuss 
in this chapter, such as opting for a higher deductible.

248      Personal Finance in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
Handling insurance rejection
Before the passage and implementation of Obamacare, those with so-called pre-
existing conditions sometimes got turned down when applying for health insur-
ance or had to pay substantially higher premiums. A similar phenomenon happens 
with other types of insurance when you’re deemed too great a risk. For example, 
you may have problems with getting life or disability insurance or have to pay a 
much greater price if you’re not in the best of health. If you’ve had a bunch of car 
accidents and speeding tickets, obtaining reasonably priced auto insurance may 
be a challenge.
When you try to enroll in a particular life or disability insurance plan (discussed in 
Chapter 15), you may be turned down because of current or previous health prob-
lems. That may happen (but isn’t likely to) in the future with health insurance, 
depending on what happens with Congress and President Trump. If your current 
health causes you to be charged a high premium or be denied coverage outright, 
try these strategies to find out why and get approved:
»
» Ask the insurer why you were denied. If you’re denied coverage because of 
a medical condition, find out what information the company has and deter-
mine whether it’s accurate. Perhaps the company made a mistake or misinter-
preted some information that you provided in your application.
»
» Request a copy of your medical information file. Just as you have a credit 
report file that details your use (and misuse) of credit (see Chapter 4), you also 
have a medical information report. Once per year, you can request a free copy 
of your medical information file (which typically highlights only the more 
significant problems over the past seven years, not your entire medical 
history) by calling 866-692-6901 or visiting www.mib.com (click on “Request 
Your MIB Consumer File”). If you find a mistake on your report, you have the 
right to request that it be fixed. However, the burden is on you to prove that 
the information in your file is incorrect. Proving that your file contains errors 
can be a major hassle — you may even need to contact physicians you saw in 
the past because their medical records may be the source of the incorrect 
information.
»
» Shop around. Just because one company denies you coverage doesn’t mean 
that all insurance companies will deny you. Some insurers better understand 
certain medical conditions and are more comfortable accepting applicants 
with those conditions. Although most insurers charge higher rates to people 
with blemished medical histories than people with perfect health records, 
some companies penalize them less than others. An agent who sells policies 
from multiple insurers, called an independent agent, can be helpful because 
she can shop among a number of different companies.

BONUS CHAPTER  The Lowdown on Health Insurance      249
»
» Find a job with an employer whose insurer doesn’t require a medical 
exam. Of course, this shouldn’t be your only reason for seeking new employ-
ment, but it can be an important factor. If you’re married, you may also be 
able to get into an employer group plan through your spouse’s plan.
»
» Find out about state high-risk pools. A number of states, before the 
implementation of Obamacare, acted as the insurer of last resort and provided 
insurance for those who couldn’t get it from insurance companies. State 
high-risk pool coverage is usually quite basic, but it beats going without any 
coverage. The Health Insurance Resource Center website provides links to all 
state health coverage high-risk pools on its website at www.healthinsurance.
org/risk_pools. Alternatively, you can check with your state department of 
insurance (enter your state and “department of insurance” into your favorite 
search engine) for high-risk pools for other types of insurance, such as 
property coverage.
Health Savings Accounts: Tax Reduction 
for Healthcare Costs
Health savings accounts (HSAs) are terrific for reducing your taxes while saving 
money for healthcare expenses. They especially make sense if you’re self-
employed or an employee of a smaller company with no health plan or a high-
deductible health plan.
An HSA is fairly simple: You put money earmarked for medical expenses into an 
investment account that offers tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred 
compounding, just like a retirement account (withdrawals aren’t taxed so long as 
the money is used for qualified healthcare expenses). For tax year 2017, you can 
sock away up to $3,400 for an individual account and $6,750 for a family account. 
To qualify for an HSA, you must have a high-deductible health insurance policy — 
at least $1,300 for individuals and $2,600 for families.
You don’t have to deplete the HSA by the end of the year: Money can compound 
tax-deferred inside the HSA for years. If you qualify, you can begin to investigate 
an HSA through insurers offering health plans you’re interested in or with the 
company you currently have coverage through (also see my website, www.
erictyson.com, for the latest information on the best HSAs).
You may also be able to save on taxes if you have a substantial amount of health-
care expenditures in a year relative to your income. You can deduct medical and 

250      Personal Finance in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
dental expenses as an itemized deduction on Schedule A to the extent that they 
exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income.
If you expect to have out-of-pocket medical expenses and can’t qualify for an HSA 
because of your employer’s plans, find out whether your employer offers a flexible 
spending or healthcare reimbursement account. These accounts enable you to pay for 
uncovered medical expenses with pretax dollars. If, for example, you’re in a com-
bined 35 percent federal and state income tax bracket, these accounts allow you to 
pay for necessary healthcare at a 35 percent discount. These accounts can also be 
used to pay for vision and dental care.
Be forewarned of the major stumbling blocks you face when saving through medi-
cal reimbursement accounts:
»
» You need to elect to save money from your paycheck prior to the 
beginning of each plan year. The only exception is at the time of a “life 
change,” such as marriage, a spouse’s job change, divorce, the birth of a child, 
or a family member’s death.
»
» You also need to use the money within the year you save it. These 
accounts contain a “use it or lose it” feature.

264      Investing in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies

About the Author
Eric Tyson is an internationally acclaimed and best-selling personal finance 
author, lecturer, speaker, and former advisor. Through his work, he is dedicated 
to teaching people to manage their money better and to successfully direct their 
own investments.
Eric is a former management consultant to businesses for which he helped 
improve operations and profitability. Before, during, and after this time of work-
ing crazy hours and traveling too much, he had the good sense to focus on finan-
cial matters.
He has been involved in the investing markets in many capacities for more than 
three decades. Eric first invested in mutual funds when he opened a mutual fund 
account at Fidelity in high school. With the assistance of Dr. Martin Zweig, a now-
famous investment market analyst, Eric won his high school’s science fair with a 
project on what influences the stock market. In addition to investing in securities 
over the decades, Eric has successfully invested in real estate and started and 
managed his own business. He has counseled thousands of clients on a variety of 
investment quandaries and questions.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in economics at Yale and an MBA at the Stanford 
Graduate School of Business. Despite these impediments to lucid reasoning, he 
came to his senses and decided that life was too short to spend it working long 
hours and waiting in airports for the benefit of larger companies.
An accomplished freelance personal finance writer, Eric is the author of numerous 
best-selling books, including For Dummies books on personal finance, investing, 
mutual funds, and home buying (co-author), and is a syndicated columnist. His 
work has been featured and quoted in hundreds of national and local publications, 
including Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, 
The Wall Street Journal, and Bottom Line/Personal, and on NBC’s Today Show, ABC, 
CNBC, FOX, FOX Business, PBS’s Nightly Business Report, CNN, CBS national radio, 
Bloomberg Radio, National Public Radio, and Business Radio Network. He’s also 
been a featured speaker at a White House conference on retirement planning.
You can visit him on the web at www.erictyson.com.

Dedication
Before I get to the thank-yous, please allow me a really major thank-you and 
dedication.
This book is hereby and irrevocably dedicated to my family and friends, as well as 
to my former students, counseling clients, and customers, who ultimately taught 
me everything I know about how to explain financial terms and strategies so that 
all of us may benefit.

Author’s Acknowledgments
First, I’d like to thank Vicki Adang and Tracy Boggier. Thanks also to Megan Knoll 
for all of her fine editing! And thanks to everyone else who contributed to getting 
this book done well and on time.
A tip of my cap to our fine technical reviewer, Morgan Housel, who helped to 
ensure that I didn’t write something that wasn’t quite right.
