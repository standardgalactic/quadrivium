Introduction
T
he need for etiquette has not disappeared just because we live and do
business differently from the way we did 1,000 years ago. In fact, knowing
how to treat other people well is more important now than ever. In the past
40 years, fundamental changes have occurred in the makeup of the workforce
and the way people do business, and some of the rules have changed forever.
By examining how good manners apply to the work world, you benefit your-
self and everyone around you. After all, who you are shows in how you
behave and in how you appear to others. How you look, talk, walk, sit, stand,
and eat — in other words, how you present yourself — speaks volumes about
who you are and creates the impression you give other people, not only in
your personal life, but in your professional life as well.
Although the basics of etiquette remain the same, many business situations
now need redefinition and rethinking. How do you promote the right sorts of
relationships in the global office? How do you foster general goodwill and
success with your peers and managers? How do you handle gender, race, and
sexual orientation in the boardroom and in the workplace? What are the new
rules for interviewing, supervising, and changing jobs? Are there new rules
about dressing and about conversing with colleagues, clients, and bosses? 
Do new rules apply to business entertainment, conferences, trade shows, 
and travel?
Think, too, of the enormous impact of computers and the Internet on the busi-
ness world. Whether you work in the vortex of Silicon Valley or do business
far from the high-tech tornado, the Information Age and its technologies have
permanently changed most businesses. Do you know the rules for online eti-
quette; e-mail; and the use of cell phones, laptops, PDAs, and MP3 players?
The essential soft skills of good manners are critical to advancing your
career. Not only do they give you added credibility, but they also ensure that
you are an exceptional representative of your company. Having these skills
often means the difference between being pigeonholed in your current posi-
tion and being offered an attractive promotion or the opportunity to start
your own company. You may even find yourself becoming a model for others
in your business by setting a standard of respectful behavior and kindness
toward others. People around you will appreciate your graciousness and
follow your lead.

Proper etiquette is now understood to be vital to career and professional
growth, and it is important to personal growth as well. Integrating civility into
your behavior allows you to stop worrying about what to do in complex social
and business situations. When good manners become part of who you are,
they provide a foundation that you can take for granted when you encounter
stress and anxiety. More than that, etiquette helps you recognize the impor-
tance of other people and the ways in which you can be a presence without
being a burden.
The world has changed dramatically during the past few years; cross-cultural
awareness is crucial, and social and business niceties aren’t nearly as perva-
sive or clearly defined as they used to be. Knowing how to behave courte-
ously and professionally is far from trivial. Etiquette and protocol really do
count in the business world. No matter how brilliant an employee may be,
any lack of social grace will make a bad first impression on clients and busi-
ness associates.
About This Book
Business Etiquette For Dummies, 2nd Edition, guides you through the new rules
of business etiquette. You soon find that good manners are far more than just
superficial observance of social customs. You see that graciousness and civil-
ity are sincere and come from the heart.
My intention for this book is not only to answer the technical hows and whys
of etiquette and protocol, but also to show that the core of etiquette is really
a way of life — one that emphasizes attention to the needs of other people
and recognizes diversity. A person with good manners is someone who
always tries to be generous and attentive.
Read on to rediscover the good manners you may have misplaced. Perhaps
you’ll pick up a few new tips that you can incorporate into the way you work.
As you read this book, grade yourself on how you conduct yourself at work
right now, noting where you can improve.
You may use this book as a reference guide, reading any section that interests
you. You can start at the back or in the middle. I hope that I have avoided
dogmatism, but because I think certain things are really important, I have
repeated and overstated them for emphasis. This book discusses some diffi-
cult parts of life. The tough issues can’t be trivialized, but neither do I want
to be overly serious when it’s not necessary. Remember: “Life has to be lived
forward, but it must be understood backward.”

Business Etiquette For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

The book is wider than it is deep. In the effort to portray a panorama of busi-
ness etiquette, I have tried to include virtually all the topics that affect it. 
Yet no single book can provide every detail. I encourage you to join me in
exploring the rules of etiquette. Perhaps you will be encouraged to check out
some of the many other excellent books on this subject.
Conventions Used in This Book
Here are a few conventions to help you make your way through this book:
 Italics highlight definitions and emphasize certain words.
 Boldface text indicates key words in bulleted lists and actions to take in
numbered lists.
 Monofont points out Web addresses.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t put in
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. When you’re
entering one of these Web addresses, just type exactly what you see in this
book, pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Throughout this book, I share some information that may be interesting to
you but isn’t essential to your grasp of a given etiquette topic. This informa-
tion appears in sidebars (shaded gray boxes); feel free to skip them.
Foolish Assumptions
It’s never too early or too late to learn about etiquette. Everyone has to inter-
act with others to succeed. This book is great for new players in the working
world, but it’s also great for those who have been in the workplace for a while
and want to clear up some confusion about the complexities of social interac-
tion in culturally diverse business environments. In short, I assume that
those of you who pick up this book seek to understand or brush up on appro-
priate manners for the workplace; for work-related events; and for business
travel, both domestic and foreign.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts, with 24 chapters and an index. Cross-
referencing is provided between the chapters.
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully 
in the Business World
What’s all this fuss about business etiquette? Can it really help you get ahead
in business? In Part I, I explore these basic questions and share the secrets of
contributing positively to the office environment and building good relations
with people above and below you on the corporate ladder. I also navigate cul-
tural diversity in the workplace. Finally, I talk about appearance, how much it
matters, what people read into your style of dress and body language, and
what you can do to give yourself every grooming and style advantage.
Part II: Building Better 
Communication Skills
“What we have here is a failure to communicate.”
How often have you heard those words? Communication is key in business,
just as it is in personal life. In Part II, I help you get started by tackling one of
your most common challenges: meeting and greeting other people. Many of
us get tripped up on introductions, so I set you on the right path of who to
introduce to whom, how to use titles, and the all-important firm handshake.
Then I give you tips on making sparkling business conversation that every-
one will want to be part of.
Speaking on the telephone is another situation in which manners seem to
slide, so I cover how to speak and listen considerately on the phone. I explore
new tactics for handling voice mail, call waiting, caller ID, speaker phones,
and cell phones. Next, I look at the written word, and I close with brand-new
advice on electronic etiquette.
Part III: Behaving in the 
Boardroom and Beyond
Meetings are chances for people to size one another up, make judgment calls,
and decide who they want on their team. In Part III, I help you shine in the
boardroom. I hit the potential highs and lows of group gatherings, from seating
4
Business Etiquette For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

arrangements to chairing a meeting. I give you words of wisdom on surviving
trade shows and conferences, and on representing yourself and your company
to your best advantage. In addition, I show you what to do if the responsibility
for planning a special event falls to you.
Business isn’t all about meetings and industry events, however; entertaining
is also key. Business entertaining has expanded far beyond the traditional
business dinner. What about golf games, rock climbing, and hang gliding? In
this part, I put you through a real etiquette workout, reviewing everything
from table settings and wine choices to buffet lines and company retreats.
Then I help you figure out the office-party minefield. Should you give a gift?
And if so, what? I also include a reminder about combining alcohol with work
functions, and I give you some tips for handling them both gracefully.
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related
Challenges
Every office has at least one challenge: the difficult person. How do you handle
that person and wind up on the high ground? What are some tactics for deal-
ing with difficult people? In Part IV, I offer tips and strategies to help keep you
sane. I also cover office conflicts and help you decide when and how to get
involved. Then I tackle the subject of stress and how to keep your cool under
pressure. I discuss some ethical dilemmas that occur at work, and use real-
life scenarios to illustrate the right and wrong ways to handle them. I close
with a discussion of office romance and sexual harassment — and how to
draw the line between the two situations.
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale
As communication and business travel increase, people are working more
and more with colleagues overseas. You have to know how to get along in
Minneapolis and in Mumbai. Having to know so much can be intimidating, 
but in Part V, I give you some universally helpful pointers. From traveling
with colleagues to surviving airline travel to knowing what to pack and how
to speak when you get there, I get you through international business travel
with dignity. I examine international etiquette by region, explaining ways of
adapting to other cultures, customs, foreign attitudes toward women, and
ways in which business is conducted around the world.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part is where you find my best advice, concisely given — quick, tried-
and-true tips for the transition from college to career and for job interviews.

B
usiness etiquette is vitally important for creating a harmonious work
environment and for representing your company in the best manner
possible. Although many people consider their technical skills and intelli-
gence to be their most important job qualifications, many employers con-
sider the ability to get along well with colleagues and clients even more
important. Being well mannered means two things above all else: respecting
others, and treating people with courtesy and kindness.
Whether your company is a highly caffeinated startup, a small gift boutique,
or a large law firm, good manners at work are important because they empha-
size your willingness to control your behavior for the benefit of others. I
introduce you to the basics of business etiquette in this chapter.
Conducting Yourself with Class
As a representative of your company, you stand not only for yourself, but also
for the company as a whole. If you are poised, courteous, and respectful to
your company’s clients, they will extend their approving judgment to other
employees of your company. If you are inconsiderate, insolent, and rude to
your company’s clients, you will be out of a job soon.
Acting with grace and tact is also crucial within your workplace. In the follow-
ing sections, I introduce you to three important concepts: making a positive
impression on your colleagues, working well in a diverse environment, and
dressing appropriately.

Making a good impression
Your considerate behavior in the office and with clients makes a big impres-
sion; it’s instantly recognizable and beneficial to both you and to your com-
pany. When a courteous employee works with others, including his peers,
staff, and superiors, his grace lends an air of professionalism to the work-
place that others emulate and that employers reward.
Being a well-mannered business professional is harder than memorizing a
bunch of stuffy rules. The greatest challenge is to incorporate the rules of
good behavior so readily that you don’t have to think about them at all. For
details on how to make a positive impression on the job, see Chapter 2.
Working in diverse environments
In today’s increasingly global business environment, people of various 
physical abilities, races, ethnicities, and genders work together. But 
misunderstandings, thoughtlessness, and poor attitudes create barriers
among colleagues and cause fear, hurt, and isolation. The use of appropriate
language is crucial for respectful and dignified communication. Education
and considerate thought are needed to remove misunderstandings and
unnecessary discrimination in the workplace. See Chapter 3 for full 
information about acting gracefully in diverse work environments.
Dressing well
Psychologists say that most people form impressions of others in the first
four minutes and that 80 percent of an impression is based on nonverbal
signs. In other words, what comes out of your mouth has very little to do
with how people judge you. Also, after you make a first impression, getting
people to change that judgment is hard.
How you dress, how you groom yourself, and how you handle your body lan-
guage in the workplace are all part of your “packaging.” As in product packag-
ing, you can present yourself to be most appealing, and you can present
yourself differently according to the time and place.
A well-mannered person always considers the impression communicated by
clothing, body language, and grooming. Always be thinking about what 
your appearance says about you. Never pretend to be anything you aren’t.
You should not be uncomfortable or present an image that is not you, 
but you should present the best you that you possibly can. For more on
appropriate business attire and professional presence, see Chapter 4.
10
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Communicating in the Business Arena
Clear communication in business is an essential part of being courteous to
others, whether you’re conversing in person, talking on the phone, writing a
letter, or chatting on the Internet. What you say reflects who you are, so you
want your words to build others up rather than tear them down in any way.
Polishing your introductions
In the business world, you meet new people all the time, for many reasons
and in many situations. Being able to introduce others makes everyone feel
comfortable and is one of the most useful skills you can acquire in business.
The ability to remember names, shake hands properly, and graciously accept
and receive a business card demonstrates that you’re at ease and in control,
which sets others at ease too.
Knowing how to make a graceful introduction not only allows you to concen-
trate on making a good impression, but also gives you the confidence and
power to nurture relationships from the get-go. To discover more about prac-
ticing these skills and using them properly, see Chapter 5.
Mastering the art of conversation, 
in person and on the phone
So many people work in front of a computer screen all day that they tend to
forget the usual social graces of conversing. A conversation occurs when two
or more people discuss a topic, exchange ideas, share information, and give
one another an opportunity to contribute. Having a conversation is the best
way to find out what other people like, think, and need.
Every time you make or receive a telephone call at work, you’re representing
your company. Many times, the first contact a person has with a company is
over the phone, so the impression you make on the phone may be a lasting
one. Therefore, you want to sound professional.
Take the opportunity to reinforce your business contacts and improve your
work relationships by exercising your best manners when conversing in
person and using the phone. For more on improving your conversational
skills, both in person and on the phone, head to Chapters 6 and 7.
11
Chapter 1: Displaying Good Manners at Work

Understanding business 
writing, online and off
Just like a handshake or good phone skills, business correspondence can tell
people a lot about you. Anything that you mail out is a reflection on your
company, so make sure that you correspond professionally. Selecting appro-
priate stationery, crafting a business letter correctly, and remembering to
send thank-you notes not only makes you look good, but also shows that you
care about the impression you make for your company.
Communicating by e-mail is no different from writing on company letterhead.
A business communication is business, period. A certain degree of formality
is required. Just because e-mail tends to be more immediate and personable
doesn’t mean that it needs to get personal. Just thinking about how the other
person is likely to receive your communication can go a long way toward pre-
venting misunderstandings and offenses. A simple test is to ask yourself,
“How would I feel in these circumstances if I received this message?”
To find out more about how business correspondence can be the best way to
accomplish your business goals, see Chapter 8. I discuss the rules of proper
work e-mail in Chapter 9.
Taking care when using technology
The Internet has developed its own unique rules for proper behavior.
Although the Internet may seem to offer a perplexing array of new etiquette
situations, the old rules still apply. Basic courtesy always means considering
others’ needs first; it requires you to make others feel comfortable, which
forms the basis of what’s called netiquette.
One of the main principles of Internet etiquette is remembering that you are
interacting with real people in real time. Even though you see only words on
a monitor, a flesh-and-blood person is behind them. This live human being
deserves the same respect that you would offer him face to face.
The manners associated with these new devices have taken a turn for the
worse. The problem isn’t the technologies, but the ways they are being used
and abused. Technology has made communication easier, yet at the same
time, people have created a need for instant gratification. For guidelines on
minding your manners with technology, see Chapter 9. Although the informa-
tion there may not be totally new to you, knowing the rationale behind it 
is always helpful. Either way, being able to distinguish yourself online as a
considerate person to your colleagues and coworkers is important.
12
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Behaving No Matter Where 
Your Business Takes You
In business today, you must know how to conduct yourself properly in a vari-
ety of situations. From company parties to the boardroom, your behavior is
observed and judged daily by employers, clients, and coworkers. Knowing
how to behave properly and respond in certain business situations puts
everyone at ease and builds self-confidence. Your ability to establish effective
working relationships wherever your business takes you can make or break
your career.
Meetings
Business meetings are one area in which poor etiquette can have really nega-
tive effects. No matter what your job entails or where you work, knowing
meeting-etiquette rules should be a priority. Meetings provide you an oppor-
tunity to shine in front of your clients, coworkers, and superiors. You can
demonstrate your meeting manners in quite a few ways with positive results.
If you haven’t thought about what goes into being an effective meeting chair
or participant, or about how knowing a few meeting guidelines can improve
your chances of success, check out Chapter 10.
Business meals and parties
The business world can be quite overwhelming, even if you never leave the
office. When entertaining enters into the business mix, it’s easy to get con-
fused about what is appropriate and what is not. The goal of mixing business
with pleasure is to create a warm social atmosphere even with the necessary
business undertones. Business entertaining is a way to foster personal trust
and confidence in others and is the fastest-growing way to do business. From
staff breakfasts to working lunches to cocktail receptions for clients, being in
your best business form at any meal really pays off. See Chapter 11 to find
out key strategies for entertaining.
Table manners can make the difference between getting that promotion or
not, and between closing that business deal or not. Fortunately, old habits
can be changed if you want to change them; all it takes is some effort. For a
thorough discussion of proper dining etiquette, see Chapter 12.
13
Chapter 1: Displaying Good Manners at Work

Conferences, trade shows, off-site 
activities, and other events
Conferences and trade shows may masquerade as chances to update the
status of a project or to catch up on industry developments, but they’re
really a way to find out about and measure other people. These events 
give you an opportunity to shine in front of your superiors and your peers.
Industry events are also great places to make contacts in your field and find
out more about what’s going on at other companies. No matter how you feel
about these events (some people love them, and some people hate them),
guidelines exist. For details on attending special work-related events, see
Chapter 13.
Most would agree that off-site company activities are an effective means of
team building and a big part of today’s work environment. But, knowing how
to be a team player and balance work with play requires a few skills. Whether
you’re hosting a group activity, playing golf with a client, or attending a busi-
ness retreat, make your way to Chapter 14 for a few key etiquette elements
that can help you when taking part in a variety of off-site activities.
Life’s major passages
Special occasions, such as a coworker’s wedding or your boss’s birthday, can
put your manners to the test. Even though you may encounter these situa-
tions less frequently in business, they often require you to be aware of a dif-
ferent set of etiquette rules. Whether you’re attending a christening, a funeral,
or a graduation, what counts most is that you are there for your coworkers,
colleagues, and clients and that you show you care. Head to Chapter 15 for
more on making it through life’s big events with grace and style.
Overcoming Challenges at Work
Your success in getting along with others in your workplace has a major influ-
ence on your career success. You can have excellent job skills and good 
productivity, but if you don’t fit in with the people you work with and your
colleagues find you difficult, you’ll have a much tougher time winning promo-
tions and advancing your career. On the flip side, you may have to work with
someone difficult or manage conflict among colleagues. In this section, I
introduce the basics of overcoming these and other challenges.
14
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Dealing with difficult people
Sometimes, folks who work together don’t get along. Some people are diffi-
cult because of their personalities; others are difficult because of their posi-
tions in the company. You may never know why certain people are difficult,
but the reason could be a lack of self-esteem or confidence.
For better or worse, what goes on at work comprises the most significant
portion of your social life. You most likely spend more time with coworkers
than you do with friends outside work, and in many instances, you spend
more time at your job than you do with your family. Mastering the techniques
of understanding various personality traits and group dynamics will make
your work life a lot less stressful. See Chapter 16 for complete guidelines on
dealing with difficult personalities.
Coping with conflict
You can manage office conflict effectively in lots of ways. Practice active lis-
tening, ask clarifying questions, be willing to compromise, look at the bigger
picture, watch your language, and put yourself in the other person’s shoes.
When the temperature goes up, actively look for ways to cool it down. Vent if
you must (just not at work).
Believe it or not, some conflict is actually helpful. In Chapter 17, you find out
why. That chapter also introduces some effective conflict-management tools
to help you and your colleagues get along better.
Managing ethical dilemmas
Countless unfamiliar situations can arise in the workplace — situations in
which you simply don’t know how to behave. Knowing how to handle every
situation that comes up is impossible, but there are ways to handle the ups
and downs of life on the job. See Chapter 18 to learn how your ethical man-
ners can be your trademark.
Handling sexuality
Know your company’s policies before you get into any situation involving
more than day-to-day contact with another employee. Your company may
have rigid rules about fraternizing and may have special provisions designed
to head off suspicions of harassment. The etiquette of office romances
15
Chapter 1: Displaying Good Manners at Work

involves a combination of good judgment and discretion, but company rules
are absolute. Yield to temptation of the wrong sort, and you may find yourself
out of a job or transferred to a remote location that’s snowbound eight months
out of the year.
Assuming that both you and your prospective partner are unencumbered and
officially eligible, and that your company has no policy against it, there’s
nothing shameful about a blossoming romance. But no etiquette exists for
illicit romances — just sad consequences. To learn more about handling sex-
uality in the workplace, check out Chapter 19.
Traveling Near and Far
You can’t find a tougher test of your manners than when you’re traveling,
especially when you’re traveling abroad. No question, travel — especially
business travel — can put people under tremendous stress. But being away
from home doesn’t give you permission to abandon politeness. Good travel-
ers are always ready for the unexpected.
Packing up and heading out
Being a model of good manners means that when you leave home, your man-
ners travel with you. Knowing a few key elements for having a safe and suc-
cessful trip is essential. What does that have to do with etiquette? The better
prepared you are for a trip, the better your experience will be. Head to
Chapter 20 for details on traveling anywhere with your manners intact.
Acting gracefully after you arrive
After you arrive at your destination, you have to adapt to the local ways of
getting around, time changes, unusual foods or table manners, and means of
communication. Feeling completely comfortable in another culture can take
months or sometimes years, but with just a little research, you can lessen
your chances of committing a minor error or a major faux pas.
To acclimate yourself to a different culture and avoid offending your host or
business colleagues, try to blend in, dress conservatively and appropriately,
keep your voice low, refrain from showing strong emotions in public, and
behave in a pleasant manner no matter what happens. Also, when you’re
asked to taste some exotic food, do your best to be a good sport! For more 
on ways of adapting to another culture, see Chapter 21.

Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Minding your manners in different 
regions of the world
A wide variety of appropriate behavior exists for building business relation-
ships in different areas of the world. By discovering and understanding the
customs and cultures of the country you’re visiting, you show that you have
respect for the other side, and respect is crucial in building a rapport and
developing business relationships. For complete details on regional business
etiquette, travel to Chapter 22.

Chapter 2
Making a Positive 
Impression on the Job
In This Chapter
 Standing out during the job interview
 Developing good office etiquette
 Visiting other offices
A
successful career does not come only to those who have worked the
longest or the hardest, or to those who have the most impressive
résumés. These days, many corporations are unwilling to send someone to
the front lines unless she has a little polish, style, and finesse. (And a little
finesse goes a long way!) This is the new competitive edge.
In this chapter, you are introduced to the skills required to be respectful and
polite in your professional life, from your job interview to everyday life in the
office, classroom, hospital, or wherever you work. Among other things, you
discover how to respect others’ privacy, how to handle criticism and compli-
ments, and how to be a good visitor. By the end of the chapter, you’ll know
what it takes to be a gracious and generous colleague.
Surviving the Job Interview
So after days of networking, you have an interview with the company you
most want to work for. Congratulations! Your next response is likely dread.
How can you make the best possible impression? What will make you stand
out above the others? You want to be polite and charming, but you don’t
want to come across as overly confident or arrogant. You want to negotiate a
great starting package, but you don’t want to seem greedy. Bottom line: You
want the company to like you, and you want it to convert that affection into
cash while everyone maintains professional decorum.

If you’re like most people, job interviews are on your list of least-favorite
activities. Just as you’re meeting a whole group of people for the first time,
you’re also trying to assess them as potential colleagues, as well as to deter-
mine whether all those nice things they’re saying about the company and how
much they love it are really true. You’re also trying to assess the job and 
how it compares with your other opportunities. As though those things weren’t
enough, you suddenly need to brag about your many accomplishments —
something your mother told you never, ever to do. All this pressure is enough
to send you around the bend.
Relax. This section doesn’t guarantee you that dream job, but it can help you
make a positive impression while maintaining your dignity.
Soul searching before job searching
First of all, you need to put some serious effort into deciding what kind of job
you really want. You’re in luck. An entire industry is dedicated to helping you
find the perfect job. Start on the Internet, or at your local library or bookstore.
You can also check out job-search Web sites such as www.monster.com or
www.careerbuilder.com. These sites not only give you guidance about dif-
ferent lines of work, but also provide job counseling, interviewing tips, and
outstanding advice on composing an effective résumé.
Before you secure an interview, read and learn as much as possible about the
company. Test flagship products, read annual reports, memorize the names
of the top executives, and know the stock price. You can gain this information
by searching online for relevant articles, looking in business journals, or read-
ing a company brochure or Web site. This not only gives you added confidence
and prepares you to answer questions or ask questions about the company or
the products, but it also helps you decide whether it’s a company that you
truly want to work for.
In the very unlikely event that the company doesn’t have an online presence
or that its site isn’t very informative, start with what you know:
 Query the person who referred you to the company for information.
Does the boss have any pet peeves? What are they? What is the com-
pany culture? Is the company formal or casual? Is there a dress code?
What should you wear to the interview?
 Do a news search for the past few months, and see what you can find.
Being aware of recent press releases gives you a better understanding 
of the business, and it also shows you’re interested in the company, the
new products, marketing strategies, or other activities. You’ll also be
better prepared to answer questions.
 Track down the friend of the friend who used to work there. Most
people like to talk about their careers, and almost everyone is pleased 
to help a job-hunter.
20
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Writing appropriate cover 
letters and résumés
Unless you’re using a job-search company, most employers today request that
you e-mail them a résumé and state that they’ll contact you if they’re inter-
ested. When you send your résumé to a company, either via e-mail or as hard
copy, you should always attach a cover letter. Cover letters are so important
to the application process that many times employers or HR managers reject
those résumés that arrive without one.
The cover letter should be on personalized stationery, with your address,
telephone number, and e-mail address (if you have one) at the top of the
page. Include this basic information even if the letter is an e-mail message 
or e-mail attachment.
Do not use unusual fonts or brightly colored paper. Use fonts such as Times
or Arial. And stick to cream-colored paper and black type. You want your
résumé to stand out — but in a good way!
Stick to the communication medium you start with until the employer changes
it. If you begin the correspondence on the Internet, you may continue on the
Internet. If the company starts to call you, you call the company back. (See
the next section for information on how to handle yourself on the phone with
a potential employer.)
Your cover letter should follow these guidelines:
 Keep the letter short and to the point. Even though your résumé took
you hours to write, hiring managers typically spend one minute reviewing
it. Keep the cover letter to one page and make the most of it by briefly
highlighting your qualifications, giving a short explanation of any gaps in
your employment, and providing information that will entice the employer.
 State your interest in the job, and provide contact information. If you
have names to drop, now is an appropriate time. (“Our mutual friend, Dr.
Phil Thomas, told me you have been golfing together for years, and he
suggested I get in touch with you about entry-level accounting positions.”)
 Don’t go into unnecessary detail or discuss personal interests. The
same goes for your religious affiliation, height, weight, sexual orienta-
tion, or any other facts that could possibly be used against you. Until
you’re in an actual interview, potential employers are unlikely to be
interested in any type of personal information.
 Don’t be too generic. It’s important to customize your résumé and cover
letter for each employer and job for which you apply. By tailoring your
information and materials, you can show that you will be a perfect fit for
the position.
21
Chapter 2: Making a Positive Impression on the Job

 Avoid grammatical and typographical errors in your résumé and cover
letter at all costs. Your sloppiness, however unintentional, may be inter-
preted as a character trait. Use spell-checking and grammar-checking soft-
ware, and have at least two people you trust proofread both résumé and
letter before you send them. Use Standard American English, please — no
shortcuts or text-messaging vocabulary!
Your résumé should be long enough to include all pertinent information that
is relevant to your current career. One page is just fine if it allows you to pre-
sent a complete picture. If not, don’t be shy about adding an extra sheet, but
your résumé shouldn’t be longer than two pages.
One reliable format is a modified chronology, listing skills first, followed by
work experience in reverse chronological order (most current first) and then
education.
Unless you already have permission to do so, do not e-mail large or complex
attachments with your cover letter and résumé. Although attachments may
be appropriate if you’re applying for a position as a Web designer, never
assume that the other person has time to download your creations.
For more information, check out Cover Letters For Dummies, 2nd Edition, and
Resumes For Dummies, 5th Edition, written by Joyce Lain Kennedy and pub-
lished by Wiley.
Making the most of phone calls
After you send a résumé and cover letter, the next step normally is a follow-
up call to make sure that the résumé was received. However, this depends on
the manner in which you have applied for the job. If you send a résumé for a
job opening on a job search Web site or on a company Web site, check first to
see what policy is in place. Many times it states that you will be contacted if
there is an interest. If you’ve spoken with a potential employer or had any
communication before you’ve sent your résumé, normally you can follow up
with a call. Prepare for the call by practicing what you want to say. Your goal
is to sound and speak intelligently — no shakiness in your voice, stammering,
or (worse) rambling on out of nervousness. You want to sound confident, so
practice until you feel completely comfortable, and use the following tips:
 If you’re calling the company for information or to follow up on a sent
résumé, always introduce yourself first. Say something like “Hello, this
is Ron Johnson. I’m calling for Harold Haynes” or “Hello, this is Ron
Johnson. I’m calling to find out the name of your vice president of 
marketing.”
 Be patient. Receptionists often must put you on hold momentarily to
address other incoming calls or to transfer the call.
22
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

 Provide additional information politely if the person with whom you’re
speaking requests it. Most receptionists and assistants try to screen calls;
however, they normally have no problem with providing the information
you need to send a résumé or to follow up after sending one. Let the
person you’re speaking with know your availability (and flexibility) should
an interview be requested.
 Explain the subject briefly when making follow-up calls. Say some-
thing like “I had sent Mr. Haynes my résumé, and I’m calling to make
sure he received it.”
 Leave a brief message if you get the person’s voice mail. Include your
name and phone number, and explain your reason for calling. At the end
of the message, repeat your name and number slowly.
 Find out the name of the person who has helped you before hanging
up, in case you need to call back.
 Always say, “Thank you”!
Knowing what to wear 
(and what not to wear)
Dressing for a job interview used to be very simple: navy suit, white blouse
or shirt, and well-polished black shoes. If you’re interviewing in a traditional
office and/or industry, these rules still apply. Pick a conservative tie or scarf
to match your suit ensemble, snip off errant price tags, lose the flashy jew-
elry and excessive perfume or aftershave, use a comb, brush your teeth, and
you’re home free.
In recent years, however, dress codes have become much more relaxed at
many companies and nonexistent at others. In this case, your decision is a
little more difficult.
Many employers explain that their casual dress policies recognize that job
performance is more important than appearance. At the same time, most of
the people who will interview you — whether they admit it or not — would
like to see some sign that the interview is worth some special effort on your
part. Dress is one way to convey that impression.
Even though workplace dress codes have relaxed in the past few years and
you have more choices regarding what you can wear, it is still important to
step it up a notch. If you’re not wearing a business suit for the interview, your
attire should reflect that you respect yourself. Beyond that, you may want to
consider a few subtleties that can affect your choice of outfit. For example, 
to make a good impression, wear an outfit that would be suitable for the work
you would be doing. If you would be doing computer work in an office envi-
ronment, neat slacks and a well-pressed, button-down shirt or blouse will do.
23
Chapter 2: Making a Positive Impression on the Job

If the job calls for a uniform, business casual for the interview is appropriate.
For an outside sales position, men should consider dressing in a tie and busi-
ness suit. Women clearly have more options, but a jacket and skirt or slacks
will suffice. Remember, business casual isn’t the same as “casual” and can vary
from company to company. Just make sure you’re within the boundaries of the
company’s standards. For more on dressing professionally, see Chapter 4.
As a general rule, tattoos and piercings shouldn’t be visible during the inter-
view, especially in conservative business settings. Remove your piercing
ornaments ahead of time.
Practicing for the interview
The best person for the job must be able to communicate to the interviewer
that she is the best person for the job. To effortlessly navigate through the
interview process, practice is required.
Careful thought about your job search will keep you from wasting others’
time. Doing practice interviews is an excellent strategy — if you can’t hire 
a professional coach, rehearse interviewing with friends, family members,
friends of the family, or at least at companies you have some interest in, even
if you consider them to be last resorts. If you can’t get anyone to listen to
your interview, do an interview with yourself and videotape it if possible.
Face-to-face communication is 58 percent body language, 35 percent tone of
voice, and 7 percent words used. Your body doesn’t know how to lie. Find out
as much as you can about your body language by being aware of your posture
and breathing, the positions of your hands and feet, and your facial tensions.
(See Chapter 4 for more about the importance of body language.)
There are numerous Web sites on the Internet that give you everything you
need to know for acing that interview! These job search sites include recom-
mendations and suggestions on what to wear, relaxation techniques, how to
get mentally prepared, what not to say, questions for you to ask, sample dia-
logue, common questions interviewers ask (and answers to sell yourself), tips
for group interviews, and much more. For an interesting array of resources,
check out the following Web sites: www.careerbuilder.com, www.monster.
com, and www.hotjobs.yahoo.com.
If you can’t videotape your rehearsal, use an audiotape so you can hear your
responses. What you say is important, but how you say it is just as important.
24
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Once you’re prepared, rehearse the interview from start to finish — from
greeting the interviewer, to exiting confidently. Here are a few pointers to
keep in mind when practicing on your own:
 Dress in the attire you plan to wear to the interview.
 Practice while sitting in a chair in front of a full-length mirror so you can
observe your mannerisms. Observe your posture while standing and 
sitting, as well as your facial expressions and hand movements.
 Don’t fidget, tap your fingers, wring your hands, or touch your hair, face,
or jewelry.
 Read through a list of common questions and respond to each as though
you are really in the interview.
 Don’t ramble on; keep answers short and on track.
 Remain professional and upbeat, but don’t be overly friendly or get 
too comfortable by discussing health problems or sharing personal
information.
 If it’s an interview over a meal, practice your table manners.
For additional help, purchase a copy of Job Interviews For Dummies,
3rd Edition, by Joyce Lain Kennedy (Wiley).
Painting a rosy picture on the big day
Everybody’s nervous about a job interview. What should you do? If your hands
have a tendency to sweat, apply some hand sanitizer with alcohol just prior to
entering the office or, in severe cases, apply antiperspirant to your palms just
before leaving the house in the morning and again just before entering the
interview building.
Next, relax! That’s right — relax. If that seems impossible, just concentrate
on breathing deeply. The idea is to keep oxygen flowing to your brain so that
you can remember all the reasons why you deserve this job. Deep breathing
also prevents you from losing consciousness and waking up underneath that
big ficus tree in the lobby.
You have a great deal on the line in a job interview, of course, but your dis-
play of nervousness may thwart your ability to negotiate the best deal and
may even harm your chances of getting the job. Does that fact not make you
feel any better? Take more deep breaths, and read the following sections.
(For additional help, see Job Interviews For Dummies.)
25
Chapter 2: Making a Positive Impression on the Job

Arriving at the office
Here are a few pointers to get you started:
 Be on time. If you get lost easily (or even if you don’t), allow a few extra
minutes for construction delays, traffic, and a pit stop. If you’ve never
been to the building before, get specific directions, including where to
park, which entrance to use, and where to go when you get inside. Write
the information down, and look at a map. Better yet, drive over a day 
or two in advance so that you know exactly where you’re going.
 Be early. There’s no crime in arriving early. Arriving early will help you
relax, allow you to review your notes, and give you time to freshen up in
the restroom and perhaps get a drink of water before the interview.
 Get the correct pronunciation of your interviewer’s name. You can ask
for this information when you’re asking for directions. If the name is dif-
ficult, practice.
 Know your interviewer’s title, if any, and use it until asked to do oth-
erwise. You do not call your interviewer by her first name until your
host informs you that you can drop the titles and surnames.
 Bring a folder with a few clean copies of your résumé, some paper to
write on, and a pen. A leather portfolio adds a nice touch.
 Leave unnecessary items in your car. When the interviewer shows you
to her office, you don’t want to spend time packing for the trip. Women
in particular sometimes find themselves loaded down with purses, tote
bags, briefcases, and enormous zippered day planners.
 Be pleasant to the receptionist, assistant, security guard, or anyone
else who may be helping you find your interviewer. If this person is on
the phone, be patient. Find something else to look at until she finishes,
and don’t tap your fingers on the counter or succumb to other nervous
tics. At the very least, this person is another working professional who
deserves your respect.
Try not to be overly friendly, however. Take your cue from the employee.
If she strikes up a conversation, go with it. If she seems busy, don’t bother
her. Now is not the time to line up a date. (If you don’t get the job, you can
always call back.)
 Don’t chew gum, smoke, eat, or drink on company premises unless
refreshments are offered. Your water bottle, handy though it may be,
does not belong on the interviewer’s desk — even if you’re very thirsty,
and even if your doctor has advised you to drink lots of water.
Acting appropriately during the interview
If you’ve been practicing your etiquette, then good behavior has already
become habit. If you have not been practicing, you may want to skip around
to other pertinent chapters of this book to refresh your memory.
26
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Also, do the following:
 Dress appropriately.
 Start with a smile and firm handshake.
 Stand up when your interviewer approaches.
 Greet the interviewer by name, look him in the eye, and thank him
for this opportunity. Refer to the interviewer as “Mr. Nguyen” if you
have never met. If you have met, and if he indicated that calling him by
his first name is okay, you can do so.
 Give the interview your full attention. This opportunity may be your
best chance not only to sell yourself, but also to notice important details
about the interviewer and the company. Minimize possible distractions
by turning off cell phones, watches, and other beeping gadgets.
 Watch your language. Swearing is never appropriate at the office and
never appropriate during an interview. Even if the interviewer swears,
you don’t have to.
 Be as specific as possible in answering the interviewer’s questions.
Anticipating possible questions (again, with the help of the many avail-
able resources) is helpful and allows you to prepare your answers.
Whenever possible, cite actual examples from your experience. Give
yourself time to think about your answers before you speak; they don’t
have to be automatic.
 Add other comments and ask questions at the end of the interview.
When the interviewer finishes answering questions, she almost always
gives you the opportunity to add other comments and ask questions. 
If you feel that the questions she asked didn’t allow you to explain why
you’re the right person for the job, now is the time to volunteer that
information.
Be positive, and always paint a rosy picture of previous jobs and bosses.
You should always have some upbeat questions. Even if you feel that
you know everything already, ask something like “What is your favorite
thing about working here?” Avoid questions on a negative topic for the
company or questions that you can answer easily through a Web site or
annual report; if you ask them, the interviewer may conclude that you
didn’t take the time to research the company.
Closing the interview
When the interview is over, do the following:
 End as you began, with a firm handshake, good eye contact, and a big
smile.
 Tell the interviewer now that you’ll call her to follow up, and specify 
a time period that’s reasonable based on your discussion. If she indi-
cated that the company will be interviewing for another three weeks
27
Chapter 2: Making a Positive Impression on the Job

before making a decision, tell her that you’ll follow up with a call near
the end of the three weeks.
 Thank the interviewer again for her time.
 Walk out confidently. You did it!
Sealing the deal
You must always, always write a follow-up note immediately after an inter-
view. Compose your note in your very best handwriting in black or blue ink,
on quality cream or white paper — no cheap store-bought thank-you notes or
decorated stationery, please.
And yes, if you interviewed with several people, each person gets a note. You
should make an effort to vary the wording a little, just in case these people . . .
well, compare notes!
Your note can be very simple: a salutation, a thank-you, a specific point of
some kind, and a closing. Figure 2-1 shows an example.
Even if your handwriting is atrocious, a handwritten note has far more impact
than an e-mail or no note at all. At the very least, the interviewer will put you
on the list of people who took the time to follow up. If the hiring decision is a
close contest among several candidates, your graceful good manners could
give you the edge.
In many instances, you may apply for a job via e-mail or a Web site and then
be interviewed via e-mail without ever speaking to a human being. In that
case, you may e-mail your follow-up note. If you’ve had a telephone interview,
however, your note should still be handwritten. The only other time an e-mail
follow-up/thank-you note is appropriate is when the length of time until the
decision to hire is less than the time your handwritten note will take to arrive
by regular mail. In this instance, do make mention of this in your e-mail by
indicating that although your preference would have been to send a nice note
by regular mail, because of the shortness of time, you had to send it via e-mail.
You even send a short thank-you note to someone who gives you a screening
interview. You may not get beyond the screening interview, but your good
manners will be remembered if any other job for which you’re qualified
comes up in the future.
Last, follow up by phone as you said you would. If you don’t get a return call
right away, don’t be a pest. Let a couple of days pass between calls, or alter-
nate between telephone calls and e-mails. Most people are busy but commit-
ted to getting back with you. If someone refuses to call you back, you’re
probably lucky not to be working with that person!

Everyone knows people who are easy to work with and people who are not

just why some people are so much harder to work with than others. Psycho-
logical explanations may help you understand, but they don’t always help
you work with difficult individuals. For that, you need patience, respect, and
consideration. In short, you need good manners.
The prime directive in office or basic work etiquette is treating each person
with courtesy and respect. Having good manners in the workplace means
working with others so that you’re a positive part of the work environment,
even when the environment is stressful, even when others aren’t being help-
ful, even when some people are being out-and-out rude. I explain how to
interact with colleagues, staff, and superiors in the following sections.
Problems that start small can become big if you let them go on very long. Small
slights, swearing, peevishness, and forced smiles have a way of getting under
everyone’s skin. More-outrageous behavior — such as temper tantrums,
yelling matches, crude displays of power, and harassment of any kind —
simply shouldn’t be tolerated by anyone.
Developing good relations with your peers
You can do many things in a work environment to irritate people, just as you
can do many things to make yourself a prized worker. In the following sec-
tions, I explain how to foster happy, well-mannered work relationships with
your colleagues.
Understanding personality types
Part of respect is knowing enough about others to know what they’re likely to
like and dislike. The polite person is sensitive to differences in personality
types and acts on that knowledge. A work environment has lots of personal-
ity types. Watch for the behaviors that each personality type exhibits, and
appreciate the diversity. People’s quirks are inherently interesting, and
acknowledging them can help increase harmony.
 The control freak: This personality wants to do it all herself. She 
doesn’t easily trust others but will do a great deal of work. You can 
identify a control freak by her impatience with others on tactical and
strategic decisions and by her constant desire for more challenges.
 The appreciation fan: This person wants to be recognized by others. You
can identify her by her self-promotion and her promotion of her team. She
gets sulky if her hard work isn’t recognized publicly on a regular basis.
 The obsessive: This person wants to get things right. She’s an informa-
tion junkie and may be a loner. You can identify this person by the way
she devours information — the more, the better! She’ll do outrageous
amounts of work, but she doesn’t like to make decisions because she is
afraid that the decision she makes may be wrong.
30
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

 The consensus-builder: This person wants everyone to get along. Not
given to making quick decisions — how could there be such a thing
when everyone has to agree? — the consensus-builder is inclusive and
compassionate. She enjoys working with others but gets nervous when
asked to take the initiative by herself.
 The socialite: This person wants everyone to have a good time. You can
identify her by her preference for chatting while others are around and
having fun. Although she works best after hours or at home, the socialite
generally improves other people’s motivation.
 The steamroller: This person wants to get things done now. You can
identify her by her willingness to make decisions, even when informa-
tion is incomplete. On a team, the steamroller keeps the group moving 
at full speed and won’t tolerate seemingly meaningless discussions.
Most people are combinations of these basic types, and each of these person-
ality types is helpful in particular situations. Need a quick decision? Go to the
steamroller. Need to put a team together for a project? Make sure that you
include a consensus-builder. Need someone to sift through a long report? 
The obsessive person is your choice.
The idea behind looking at personality types is not to pigeonhole people, but
to recognize certain strengths and weaknesses. One of the keys to etiquette 
is paying enough attention to others to be able to modify your behavior to
accommodate them. Appropriate responses to particular personality types
are helpful for anyone who wants to be an effective colleague.
Using the right office manners
All the different personality types have to live together in a small space, of
course. Keep the following tips in mind for surviving life in a workplace 
environment:
 Dress in a manner consistent with company culture, and make sure that
your clothes are always clean.
 Treat a cubicle as though it has a door and a ceiling. Speak calmly and
with an even cadence in person and on the telephone. Personal tele-
phone conversations should be kept to a minimum if you inhabit a cubi-
cle. No one wants to hear your arguments with your spouse.
Confidential business conversations should also be kept to a minimum if
you’re in a cubicle. You don’t want to spill the beans prematurely about
some important deal.
 Face forward in elevators. If you’re getting off near the top of the build-
ing, move to the rear of the elevator. If you’re getting off on a lower floor,
stand close to the front.
 Say “Hello” or “Good morning” to those you encounter in the morning
and “Good night” to those you encounter as you leave.
 Shower or bathe every day.
31
Chapter 2: Making a Positive Impression on the Job

Avoid these faux pas:
 Don’t interrupt others unnecessarily or visit their offices or cubicles
while they are working.
 Don’t bring odorous food to the office.
 Keep music low so as not to disturb others.
 Heavy use of perfume or cologne is a no-no.
Developing good relations with your staff
Your staff helps you do your work. They’re not your slaves, and they’re not
drones; they’re people who deserve your respect. Praise them when their
work is excellent. Comment on their work (in private) when it needs improve-
ment. Above all, acknowledge their existence and their hard work, and treat
them with courtesy. Without them, you wouldn’t get your work done. In the
following sections, I show you how to work well with your staff.
The best way to earn respect is to treat others with respect. As the boss, the
things you say and do have consequences for others. Do your best to make
these consequences positive:
 Ask, rather than tell, others to do things.
 Be clear.
 Be polite.
 Learn people’s names, and use them.
 Recognize that everyone has a life outside work.
 Show sensitivity, be accommodating, and don’t pry.
Remembering the right names
Get names right. Learn other people’s names and how they prefer to be
addressed. Memorizing names is hard for some people and easy for others. 
If it’s hard for you, admit it up front. If you make a mistake and call someone
by the wrong name, apologize, and blame yourself. Say something like “I’m
terribly sorry, Juan. I’m so bad with names sometimes. I’ll get it right from
now on.” Then make an effort to get it right.
Repeat the name to yourself as soon as possible; then find a pen and write
“Juan in Information Technology” 30 or 40 times. This trick works!
As far as your own name goes, let your staff know how you prefer to be
addressed. Say your name slowly and clearly when you meet new employees
so that others will understand the proper pronunciation. Spell your name if
you think it will help.
32
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Acting calm, collected, and respectful
An oppressive boss is a nightmare. Someone who thinks her employees need
to be blamed for her mistakes, or someone who thinks her assistants should
understand that her violent temper is simply part of her creativity, is a noto-
rious figure. Follow these guidelines for harmonious working relations with
your staff:
 You want your employees to respect you, and you want them to be will-
ing to give their best for you and the company. You will get both only if
you treat them with respect and hold yourself to the same standards.
 Keeping an even tone in your voice helps everybody work efficiently.
Dictating a dismissal letter in a calm manner is better than venting your
rage while you dictate. Correcting errors is best accomplished privately,
politely, and precisely. Yelling at people — even people who deserve 
it — is rarely effective.
 Try to give precise and clear instructions. Vague and ambiguous instruc-
tions are stressful for anyone who’s trying to fulfill them. Rather than
saying “Do you understand?” say, “I’m not sure I’ve covered everything.
Can you think of anything that I’ve left out?”
No one is perfect, of course. If you make a mistake, admit it. If someone else
makes a mistake, remember that your irritation is rarely another person’s
motivation. Instead, focus on the situation and its solution.
Developing good relations 
with your superiors
Unfortunately, plenty of bosses expect a level of servitude that is utterly un-
reasonable. Whether you’re in business, entertainment, academia, or bank-
ing, you find oppressive superiors who enjoy watching people squirm. I talk
about how to deal with some kinds of bad bosses in Part IV. Here, I discuss
general guidelines for appropriate behavior toward those who are higher
than you in rank.
Newcomers at a company often believe that they can establish themselves in
a company’s culture by being unfailingly outgoing and friendly. The trouble
is, business culture is based on rank; friendliness, even if well intentioned, is
sometimes at odds with rank. Your primary function at work is to do your
job. Too much friendliness can actually hurt your effectiveness.
One way that friendliness unleavened with manners can be unproductive is in
your relations with your superiors. Slapping them on the back and assuming
that they’re interested in your latest adventure may get you nowhere fast.
And talking to them as though you are their equal may be seen not as
friendly, but as bumptious and pushy.
33
Chapter 2: Making a Positive Impression on the Job

So curb your chumminess, and check your sense of humor enough to avoid
humiliation. Take the following tips as your first lesson in cultivating good
relations with your superiors:
 Follow the boss’s lead.
 Do your job.
 Treat your boss with respect and understanding.
 Call your boss “Mr. Garcia” if everyone else in your position does so.
Don’t assume that you have the right to call him “Spike” unless he asks
you to do so.
 Don’t assume that your boss is your friend. Don’t venture into your
boss’s private life unless you’re invited.
 Don’t confuse business entertaining with social events.
Interacting with superiors requires that you be aware of certain subtleties.
Although your company may have a friendly “backyard barbecue” culture,
your boss should be the person to introduce more-personal subjects. 
If you’re in a social situation with your boss, general small-talk topics are 
permissible until your boss takes the lead and introduces other topics. See
Chapter 6 for more on business socializing.
Offering compliments and criticism
Compliments and criticism are unavoidable in the workplace. I cover both in
this section.
Praise and criticize the work, not the person.
Compliments
Compliment others when they’ve done exceptional work, when they’ve done
more than you’ve asked them to do, and when they’ve done you a favor.
Don’t cheapen compliments by offering them willy-nilly, like a kindergarten
teacher. Give compliments when people deserve them. Think of them as 
little gifts.
A compliment shows appreciation for someone else’s work. Focus the atten-
tion on the other person, not on yourself.
Giving compliments should be easy, but surprisingly, most people need prac-
tice to do it right. Always compliment
34
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

 Politely: Be sincere, and use a genuine tone of voice. Insincere or snarling
compliments are pointless.
 Precisely: Be precise and detailed. Say something like “Jane, you did an
excellent job on the Millman project. It was accurate and extremely well
written, and I really appreciated receiving it before the deadline. Thank
you for such a great effort.”
 Promptly: Be timely. No one wants to hear “Oh, by the way, Ralph, the
work you did on that contract for what’s-his-name last year was good.”
 Publicly: Usually, it’s best to praise in public. But shy people and those
with cultural prohibitions against public praise are best praised in private.
Delivering compliments in person or in writing is largely a matter of personal
style. Some people prefer face-to-face contact; others prefer e-mail. One nice
thing to do is to compose a handwritten note, seal it in an envelope, and
deliver it to the person with a handshake and a quick “Good job.” A hand-
written note from a superior is a pleasant surprise that is long remembered.
Receiving compliments is even easier but is done poorly even more frequently.
There is one — and only one — rule for receiving a compliment. When getting
a compliment, always say, “Thank you.” That’s it! No other comments or qual-
ifiers need to be added. Be genuine. Accepting praise is hard. But thinking of
a compliment as a small gift may help.
Don’t apologize, belittle your accomplishment, or amplify the compliment by
adding your own self-praise. If you apologize or belittle your accomplishment,
the person giving the compliment will think you’re fishing for something
more. If you congratulate yourself after someone else does, you appear to 
be an arrogant so-and-so who doesn’t deserve compliments at all! Just say,
“Thank you,” perhaps smile, and be done with it.
Criticism
Giving and receiving criticism are difficult. Unfortunately, they’re necessary
parts of working. If you have to give criticism, make it constructive criticism.
Avoid anger and irrelevant detail. If you need to give praise and criticism,
give the praise before the criticism and follow up with an uplifting and posi-
tive close.
The only reason to give criticism is to improve performance. Criticizing is not
complaining, and it’s not attacking. Criticize in the following manner:
 Privately: Make comments only to those who need to be criticized, and
do so away from all others. Nobody else needs to hear what you have 
to say.
35
Chapter 2: Making a Positive Impression on the Job

 Politely: Assume that the other person has feelings that will be hurt
when she hears your criticism. Focus your comments on the problem-
atic work and not the person. Avoid identifying what she did as “stupid,”
“brainless,” or worse. And never call anyone names.
 Precisely: Criticism should be specific and constructive. Identify the
problem, and look for a solution. Say something like “Chris, last week’s
order for Arete Systems was shipped in error to Hexis World instead.
This is the third time this month that one of their orders has gone
astray. Let’s discuss what happened and figure out how to prevent this
problem in the future.”
 Promptly: Hand out criticism as soon as possible. If you’re mad, take a
few deep breaths and count to ten. Repeat as necessary! If you need
time to formulate your criticism, take it. But procrastinating only
increases the chance that the problem will be repeated and makes you
feel worse. Deal with it now.
Being criticized is difficult. When someone is criticizing you, follow the four
cardinal rules, and always take criticism
 Professionally: If the criticism is appropriate, accept responsibility.
Avoid excuses or blaming others. Apologize, assure the other person
that the mistake won’t happen again, and then live up to your word.
 Politely: Assume that the other person doesn’t mean to insult you when
she gives criticism. If she calls you names or is rude, redirect the discus-
sion to the work itself. Avoid retaliating in like manner; you’ll almost
always make the situation worse. If necessary, you may say something
like “I can see the problem here. Please accept my apologies. I’d like to
think about what you’re saying and think of a solution. May we talk again
after lunch?”
 Positively: Assume that the other person has something helpful to say.
Listen. Try to understand the issue. If you’re too mad to understand,
count to ten. Repeat as necessary! Ask for clarification. Ask for assistance.
 Appropriately: If the criticism is unfair or misplaced, say so, so long as
you’re polite and do so in private. The workplace is neither a family nor
a therapist’s office. You’re no one’s punching bag, and you’re not respon-
sible for accepting other people’s mistakes or poor performance.
Visiting Another Office
Visiting someone else’s office is generally not a complicated affair, and the
rules are fairly simple. Nonetheless, tales of churlish behavior by visiting 
colleagues have inspired these tips:
36
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

 Make an appointment. If you choose not to make an appointment, leave
quietly and cheerfully when your colleague doesn’t have time to see
you. When setting the appointment, specify how long you would ideally
like the meeting to last. This way you aren’t thinking one hour when
your colleague is thinking only 30 minutes.
 Look up your destination on a map before departing. Internet maps and
auto GPS systems have greatly reduced the risk of getting lost. Better yet,
call the office and talk to an expert — someone who drives to work there
every day. That person can also tell you where to park, which entrance to
use, and so on.
 Don’t bring any food or drink with you to someone else’s office unless
you’ve been asked to provide food for the meeting. No one wants to
watch you eat or dispose of your lukewarm latte after you leave.
 Be polite to everyone at the office. If the office has a reception desk,
state your name, whom you’re visiting, and the scheduled time of your
appointment. If the receptionist is on the phone, be quiet and wait 
your turn.
 Don’t touch things in someone’s office without asking, even if they
look like toys.

Chapter 3
Working in a Diverse Environment
In This Chapter
 Showing respect for physical differences
 Handling racial and ethnic differences
 Dealing with gender and sexual differences
T
he fact that people are different isn’t a news flash. Why, then, do people
spend so much time belaboring the obvious? People love to talk about
other people. Perhaps curiosity makes others a natural topic of conversation.
Perhaps differences are an easy source of cheap humor. But this kind of
cheap humor can get you into trouble, especially in the workplace.
Stereotyping, ridiculing, demeaning, or insulting other people is always a mis-
take. At work, this behavior can be disastrous. You should not assume that
the women in the room are secretaries or nurses, or that the men are bosses
or investors. Neither should you assume that the person on the other end of
the phone shares your ethnicity. The man using the wheelchair may be the
CEO, and your potential client may be gay.
These differences are simply not always that interesting and shouldn’t be the
subject of comment. Even when the story behind the difference may be inter-
esting, remember that prying is rude. Regardless of individual particulars,
you have a job to do that brings you together. Focus on the job, and treat
other people as important. In other words, treat them with respect.
In this chapter, you find out how to be a respectful colleague to people who
are physically, ethnically, and culturally different from you. You also are 
introduced to some straightforward principles regarding gender and sexual
differences in the workplace.
Respecting Physical Differences
The United States is home to more than 54 million people with disabilities,
and more than half of all Americans say they’re a bit unsure around people
with disabilities. Pretty clearly, life at work can be tough if you’re among the

54 million, and getting over your uncertainty about people with disabilities is
a matter of urgent importance if you’re one of the others. The following sec-
tions help you work more comfortably with your colleagues or clients who
have disabilities. If you have a disability, take the initiative by giving your
coworkers, employees, or boss some guidelines for working with you.
Starting with a few general guidelines
When you work with someone who has a disability, you may think that he
should be treated differently. This thought is a mistake, for the most part.
People are people first and disabled or nondisabled second. In the following
sections, I provide a few simple but helpful general guidelines for working
with people who have disabilities.
Making reasonable accommodations
Federal law requires that employers make reasonable accommodations for
those with disabilities. Any employer who hires someone with a disability is
expected to accommodate the disability unless undue hardship is the result.
These accommodations include providing auxiliary aids for those with vision
or hearing disabilities and making sure that physical barriers are removed if
possible. If barriers cannot be removed, employers must provide alternatives.
The National Organization on Disability (NOD) is a great place to start if you
want to find out more about disability issues. On its Web site (www.nod.org)
you can find Frequently Asked Questions, a summary of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), findings of the NOD/Harris Survey on Americans with
Disabilities, links to other sites, and more. Or contact the organization for
information: National Organization on Disability, 910 Sixteenth St. NW, Ste. 600,
Washington, DC 20006.
If you own a business, make every effort to hire workers with disabilities and
to implement Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements (www.
usdoj.gov). You may be surprised how little it costs to fully accommodate a
worker with a disability, and what a tremendous contribution that worker can
make to your company. Make the effort to court clients who are disabled as
well; doing so makes good business sense. A good resource is W. C. Duke and
Associates (www.wcduke.com), which offers industry-specific “Opening
Doors” seminars and video programs on disability etiquette and ADA 
compliance.
Really, these legal requirements are no more than what common courtesy
dictates. If you hire someone who uses a wheelchair but have no way for that
person to enter and exit the building, you haven’t considered his comfort.
40
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Using considerate language
A good place to start treating those with disabilities with respect is the lan-
guage you use. Your choice of words and the way you say them have an enor-
mous impact on the way you interact with others. Many disability groups
consider terms such as “physically challenged” patronizing:
 Avoid using words such as “handicapped,” “crippled,” and “invalid”
to refer to those with disabilities. Saying “Tom has epilepsy” is prefer-
able to saying “The epileptic guy? His name is Tom.”
 Avoid using words such as “healthy” and “normal” to refer to those
without disabilities. Many people with disabilities are in excellent health.
 Don’t refer to someone as “wheelchair-bound” or “confined to a wheel-
chair.” The chair, in fact, is a freedom machine, affording independence
and mobility.
 Use people-first terminology. A general rule is to acknowledge the dis-
ability but always place the person first. Simple as it may sound, if you
use the term “person with a disability” rather than “disabled person,”
you’re off to a good start. For example, the preferred term for a person
who can’t speak is “without speech” — not “mute” and never “dumb.”
 Talk to everyone in a medium tone of voice. Don’t talk too loudly to
anyone with a disability.
 Avoid getting overly concerned about figures of speech in the pres-
ence of people with disabilities. You can say “I see what you mean!” 
to someone who has a visual impairment, for example, and you can
invite someone who uses a wheelchair to go for a walk.
Acting properly
If you are interviewing or employing a person with a disability, certain rules
of etiquette can help you deal with that person appropriately:
 As an employer, train your staff to anticipate and accommodate those
with disabilities: Know where the accessible parking facilities, eleva-
tors, restrooms, and drinking fountains are in your building. Be prepared
to give clear directions to those with visual impairments.
 Educate yourself about the assistance technologies people with dis-
abilities are using: These devices include wheelchairs, hearing aids,
enhanced and auditory computer screens, transcription devices, walk-
ing aids, and guide animals. Find out about the assistive technologies
that your coworkers use, and adapt your presentations and communica-
tions to accommodate them. People with vision impairments use scan-
ners to move text from page to computer and screen-reading software 
to synthesize the words on the screen. People with hearing impairments
41
Chapter 3: Working in a Diverse Environment

use telecommunications devices for the deaf (TDDs) or similar 
tools. High-tech devices of all kinds are available to individuals with 
limited mobility. For an interesting primer on available assistive 
innovative products, check out Apple’s Web site at www.apple.com/
accessibility/.
Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology,
to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to
encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these
goals. Visit www.section508.gov/ for resources and tools that are
provided as a service to help implement Section 508.
 Offer to shake hands when you meet someone with a disability for the
first time: If the other person extends the left hand, shake the left hand
using your right hand, not your left. If shaking hands isn’t possible, a
nod of the head is fine. In the United States, a light touch on the shoul-
der or forearm to acknowledge the person is also appropriate. For exam-
ple, Senator Bob Dole is disabled in his right arm. He will extend his left
hand to you for the handshake and your response should be to extend
your right hand, turning it over to meet his left hand to complete a
proper handshake.
 Avoid staring at someone with a disability or averting your gaze:
Staring and averting your gaze are equally hurtful to a person with a dis-
ability. If someone stares at you, it makes you wonder what’s so strange.
But it may actually be worse if people avert their gaze, which can make
you feel that you’re so hideous that other people can’t stand to look at
you. Either way, you feel awful. Not surprisingly, then, my advice is
simple: Look everyone in the eye.
 “Helping” someone who has a disability is discouraged unless the
person has given you permission to do so: People who have disabilities
aren’t incompetent. Just as you would be offended by others who rou-
tinely offered to carry your briefcase because you’re so small or volun-
teered to make your phone calls for you because your voice sounds like
a bullhorn, people with disabilities are offended by patronizing offers of
assistance. Refraining from helping someone can be painful sometimes.
As painful as watching someone struggle may be, however, a decision to
decline your assistance must be respected.
If you’re asked to help, ask for specific instructions, and follow them
carefully. Otherwise, assume that the person is no less able to care for
himself than you are.
Dealing with specific disabilities
Some rules of disability etiquette are firm; others aren’t. You should never feed
a guide animal, but whether you should help those who have visual impair-
ments cross the street depends on their interest in having your assistance. In
42
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

the following sections, I explain how to interact with folks who have hearing,
visual, and mobility impairments.
Hearing impairments
Hearing disabilities range from the mild to the severe; they’re usually hidden
and often hard to detect. If you’re having difficulty getting a response from
someone you are speaking to, he may have a hearing disability. He probably
isn’t being rude.
If someone is hearing impaired, the best way to get his attention is to move
so that he can see you or to touch him lightly on the shoulder or forearm.
If the person with a hearing disability would like to use American Sign
Language (ASL), and you know it, by all means use it. If you don’t know how
to sign, admit it; then either find someone who does know or use writing.
Although some people would love to teach you a new language, insisting that
a person with a hearing impairment teach you ASL is rude. If you want to
learn it, go buy a book or take a class.
If the person has an interpreter, here are a few tips:
 The interpreter sits or stands next to you, facing the person with the
hearing disability: An interpreter does not say and use every word you
say. Interpreters often explain and paraphrase the meaning of your
words, versus a translator, who must, to the best of his ability, use the
exact words you have chosen to use, in the translated language. In this
situation the translator may fall behind, so pause occasionally to allow
him to catch up.
 Always talk to the person, not to the interpreter: In a business situa-
tion, never consult the interpreter. The interpreter’s job is to facilitate
conversation, not to make business decisions. If there are specific indus-
try words the interpreter should learn, make every effort to provide the
interpreter with a list or hold a brief meeting ahead of time.
Although interpreters are common in some workplace circles, particularly
political and diplomatic ones, they’re not universal. Those with hearing
impairments often use sign language or read lips. If the person you’re talking
to can read lips, here are some tips:
 Face your conversation partner: Don’t walk around.
 Speak clearly and slowly, but naturally: Exaggerating your lip movement
only makes lip-reading harder.
 Don’t eat or smoke while talking, and don’t talk with your hands near
your mouth: These activities may make it difficult for the person who’s
trying to read your lips.
43
Chapter 3: Working in a Diverse Environment

Avoid these embarrassing mistakes at all costs:
 Never shout: Shouting won’t do any good, even if the person has only
partial hearing loss.
 Never simplify what you say: You’re talking to an adult, not a child.
Visual impairments
Like hearing impairment, vision impairment comes in a wide variety of kinds
and degrees. Visual impairments include tunnel vision, in which one sees only
a small, central part of the visual field; partial vision, in which one sees a 
portion of the visual field, usually one side; and total vision impairment, in
which one sees nothing.
Always use words with someone who has a visual impairment. Here are some
tips to keep in mind:
 Announce yourself and whoever is with you to the person with a visual
disability. Say something like this: “Hi, Juan; it’s Sally. I have Wanda Lee
with me as well.”
 Say “Hello” and “Goodbye,” and tell the person when you’re moving
around the room.
 In meetings, use names with exchanges between people to help the
person with the visual impairment follow the conversation: “Valerie?
John here. Can you give us the latest on the Lohman account?”
 Offer to read instructions or other printed material aloud.
 Where danger looms, voice your concerns politely. Say, for example, “Ben,
there’s a chair directly in front of you. Would you like me to move it?”
You can really inconvenience someone if you make the following blunders:
 Never touch or move anything in the office of a person with a visual
impairment.
 Never move furniture elsewhere in the office without informing someone
with a visual impairment.
People with visual impairments often use a variety of technologies to navigate
through the world. Some carry canes, and some are accompanied by guide
dogs. Offering assistance to someone with a visual impairment is always
appropriate, but if he refuses the offer, accept it politely. And keep the follow-
ing pointers in mind:
 If you’re asked to guide, offer your elbow. Describe your route, announc-
ing upcoming transitions and changes. When you reach your destination,
avoid leaving the person in empty space. Find a chair, table, or a wall.
Place the person’s hand on the back of the chair, on the table, or on the
wall for orientation.
44
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

 At meals, describe the location of the food on the plate by using clock
time, such as “Shrimp at 7 o’clock; peas at 3.” Offer to help cut food.
 When exchanging money, place bills in separate stacks, and present
each stack. Say, for example, “Your change is $47.54. Here are two twen-
ties, one five, and two ones. And here are the 54 cents.”
 When signing documents, offer to guide the person’s hand to the cor-
rect position, and offer a straight edge (such as a ruler) for alignment.
When dealing with guide animals, never touch a guide or service animal
unless the handler gives you permission, and never call out a guide animal’s
name. Committing these faux pas is dangerous, not only to the animal and its
handler, but also potentially to you. If you touch a guide animal, you may
inadvertently be giving it a signal to do something that its handler doesn’t
want it to do. Also, calling out a guide animal’s name can divert its attention
from assisting its handler.
Mobility impairments
Mobility impairments vary from walking with difficulty to walking with a cane
to using a wheelchair. As always, treat those with mobility impairments with
respect.
People with mobility impairments often cannot go where people without
those impairments can. Be gracious in picking out routes to destinations,
taking the impairment into account.
If someone uses a motorized wheelchair, wait until the wheelchair is powered
down to shake hands. When having a conversation with someone in a wheel-
chair, move so that the two of you are at the same eye level.
Don’t let yourself make the following gaffes:
 While you put a client’s coat in the closet, never move mobility aids out
of reach.
 Never “try out” another person’s mobility aids; they’re part of his per-
sonal space.
 Never push a person in a wheelchair without permission.
 Never lean or hang on a person’s wheelchair.
Going the extra mile
If you have a disability, taking the initiative yourself is perfectly acceptable.
At the workplace, you may say, “Jim, I don’t know whether you’ve ever
worked with a person with a mobility impairment before. Here are a couple
things that will make working together easier for us.”
45
Chapter 3: Working in a Diverse Environment

As a colleague or an employer, educate yourself about the assistance tech-
nologies that your coworkers use, and adapt your presentations and commu-
nications to accommodate them. For example:
 People with hearing impairments use TDDs or similar tools.
 People with visual impairments can use scanners to move text from hard
copy pages to computer screen-reading software to synthesize the words
on the screen. They include options for magnifying the screen or spe-
cific objects on screen, or adjusting the display characteristics to make
it easier to read.
 High-tech devices of all kinds are available to individuals with limited
mobility.
Respecting Racial and Ethnic Differences
Along with the cultural diversity inherent in the global marketplace comes
confusion about how to behave. People don’t always know how to interact
with others from different ethnic and racial backgrounds. In fact, people 
don’t even know whether their behavior should be different.
Race and ethnicity are less important than your beliefs and attitudes about
these things. Don’t typecast or stereotype because of physical or cultural fea-
tures. The paramount rule of etiquette — respect for others — rules out such
behavior. Nevertheless, differences do exist, and you need to know how to
respect them. You also need to know the etiquette of particular situations
and how to adjust your verbal and nonverbal behavior for those situations.
Over time, a standard code has emerged to allow people to get along with one
another in business and to know what to expect from each other. Standard
American English is the international language of business, and standard
Western manners are the official protocol in the United States.
For better or worse, if you don’t speak or behave according to these standards,
you immediately set yourself up for criticism. But by the same token, if you
don’t recognize and respect those who follow other traditions, you may get
yourself in a jam.
A paradox lurks here. The standards of business etiquette in the United States
require Standard American English and Western manners. But Standard
American English may not be your native language, and you may be a member
of a tradition whose codes of manners are different from Western manners.
Luckily, you have a way out: When you’re in the United States, do as the
Americans do.
46
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

You don’t have to adopt American business etiquette around the clock, of
course. At times, U.S. business etiquette is entirely inappropriate, and your
role as a professional need not consume your life entirely. U.S. business eti-
quette applies when you’re doing business in the United States. When you’re
not doing business, or when you’re not doing business in the United States,
other codes of etiquette may apply. This is code change.
In addition, knowing more than one language helps almost everyone in the
business world. Learning even a few words and phrases can be a real plus. In
certain businesses — the music industry, for example — slang and jargon are
useful. But in almost all other situations, speaking and writing clearly and
grammatically are paramount (see Part II for communication tips).
Now that you can communicate, how do you behave? Respect dictates that
you take it upon yourself to learn about other cultures. If your business regu-
larly takes you to other parts of the world, take a course in protocol, or read
about those parts of the world. Flip to Part V to find out how to do business
on a global scale.
Respecting Gender and 
Sexual Differences
Dealing with gender and sex in the workplace can be a mess. In the same way
that business is color blind, it is sex blind.
The way to get along is to assume that everyone has a sex life — and then
forget about it! I don’t mean that everyone has to act the same way or that
you can’t express your individuality. But what people do in their private lives
is exactly that: private. Don’t assume that everyone is heterosexual; don’t
assume that everyone is gay. Assume that other people are interested in love
and sex but that the details are none of your business. Never make jokes or
snide remarks about gender or sexual preference.
Business is gender blind. What matters are rank and status, not gender. You
may be completely stumped when it comes to working with members of the
opposite gender, however. If you’re a woman, do you open the door for others?
Do you wait for your male boss to open the door for you?
To prevent crashes, here’s the rule: In business, the first person to the door
opens the door for everyone else, regardless of gender. Full arms exempt you
from door duty, however.
Like all good rules, this one has an exception: You always open the door for
your client or customer.
47
Chapter 3: Working in a Diverse Environment

Use the following common-sense tips as a guide to intergender relations:
 Offer to help an overburdened colleague, regardless of gender. If your
colleague has an armful of books and papers, for example, offer to take
some of them.
 The host pays for a business lunch, regardless of gender.
 Help others if they’re having a difficult time with a coat, regardless of
gender.
 Men and women stand to greet someone, regardless of the other
person’s gender.
 Women shake hands in business, as men do.

 Beginning with wardrobe basics
 Putting together workplace attire for women and men
 Grooming yourself properly
 Minding your body language
L
ike it or not, most people believe that what you see is what you get. What
they usually see first is your clothes. Clothes are a nonverbal code of
communication. What you wear signals your image to others. What signals 
do you want to send?
In business, creativity in ideas is often more important than creativity in dress.
Derived from the military dress code, the idea here is that if everyone
dresses in a relatively similar manner, the playing field isn’t so bumpy. Some
restraint is appropriate, because you want to emphasize the product or serv-
ice of your company, not your wacky sense of personal style (which is why
you have days off). You are the vehicle for the product or the service, not the
center of attention.
Then you have to consider your body language. Comporting yourself with ease
and dignity signals to others that you care enough about them, and enough
about yourself, to pay attention to your physical presence. This chapter helps
you be aware of what your clothes and your body are saying.
The basic etiquette principle of not calling too much attention to yourself
applies to clothes, too.

The Essentials of Building an 
Appropriate Work Wardrobe
No doubt about it — clothes are a source of anxiety in the business world. So
many styles are appropriate in today’s business world that getting dressed in
the morning can be baffling.
The solution? KISS — Keep It Simple and Sophisticated. You want your confi-
dence to come from your professional abilities, not to be manufactured in
Italy. Still, your clothes are important; if you dress with your next position 
in mind, you’re more likely to get there.
In this section, I describe the staples of any work wardrobe, explain how to
deal with formal dress codes and casual work environments, and show you
how to take inventory of what you own before you start shopping.
Sticking to basic colors and pieces
Memorize these colors:
 Navy blue
 Charcoal gray
 Black
 Khaki
 White
These hues are the staple colors of every business wardrobe. Regardless of
how formal or casual you are or whether you’re male or female, these colors
are the ones you start with. Don’t get me wrong; color can look great. A bright-
colored shirt, for example, can punch up a dark gray suit for both men and
women. But in general, you are better off starting with the neutrals I just listed
and adding color, rather than starting with color and trying to find something
appropriate to match. You can add a mango shirt, tie, or scarf to a charcoal
suit more easily than you can accessorize a mango suit.
Here are some guidelines for both men and women to keep in mind:
 In the suit world, start with the basics: A navy blue wool suit and a
charcoal wool suit, white shirts, black shoes, black belt, and black
leather briefcase/notebook computer case.
 In the casual world, start with the basics: Khaki pants or skirts, white
shirts, black or brown shoes and belt, and a black or brown leather or
ballistic nylon briefcase/notebook computer case.
50
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

 Add your own touches in keeping with your company’s dress code
and style.
This system is rigid, of course, and you certainly don’t have to follow it exactly.
But starting with a good foundation of high-quality, neutral-tone clothing
allows you to build a wardrobe that minimizes your anxiety and maximizes
your investment. Remember to buy the best quality you can afford. Your
wardrobe is an investment in your profession; treat it accordingly. With some
discipline, you can create a wardrobe that stays current and looks smart
without breaking your paycheck.
You shouldn’t feel uncomfortable or present an image that is not you, but you
should present the best you that you possibly can.
Dealing with dress codes
A wrinkle in business clothes is that different businesses and professions have
different dress codes. If you’re in a traditional profession like law or banking
and you’re calling on clients or having business lunches, you want to dress
within the basic guidelines for that profession. In this case, that would be
more on the conservative side — business suits and ties for men; business
suits, skirts, slacks, and jackets for women. In some cases, depending on the
style, a dress is appropriate. The most current dress style to own for work is
a classic sheath.
If you work in a more informal environment or the hi-tech industry, a less
conservative or business-casual attire is appropriate. (Read on for more on
the business-casual dilemma.)
Most companies today have a dress code, which may be articulated in an offi-
cial document available from the human resources department. If so, get a
copy of it and read it. More frequently, the dress code is unstated but enforced
by practice. In these cases, you simply have to watch and learn. Watch the
people around you, especially your boss. Whether your boss is a man or a
woman, notice the style. How formal is it? Plan your wardrobe in a similar
style. If your boss always wears suits, you should buy a suit or two. But you
don’t have to match exactly; use your own personal style.
You don’t need a millionaire’s budget to be perceived as confident and self-
assured. Being consistently well groomed, tidy, and dressed in attire that fits
you properly is far more important than the designer label or cost of your
clothing. Wear clothing that is appropriate, of the best quality you can afford,
and in good taste. Your clothing should reflect your positive attitude toward
yourself, your work, and others.
If you work in retail or advertising, you usually have many more clothing
options. Within the limits of what is considered good taste (and assuming
51
Chapter 4: Look Sharp! Creating Professional Style and Presence

you’re young enough), you can add a little flair by wearing the latest trends
and fads — many times your employer encourages this.
Defining “business casual” and “casual”
The casual look has invaded business in a big way. Dressing casually for busi-
ness takes a great deal of thought, however. Casual may allow for something
other than a suit, but it doesn’t mean that you should go to work in a skimpy
top and Birkenstocks (unless you work at a surf shop). Business casual isn’t
the same as other kinds of casual.
Business-casual wear is its own category and has caused a lot of confusion in
the business world. Before business casual was in existence, the terms used
were formal business wear, informal business wear, and casual wear. (These
terms are still used today as well.)
Business-casual wear is a growing trend and an accepted dress code that
started in white-collar companies in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particu-
larly in the information technology businesses in Silicon Valley, California.
(Just to add to the confusion, business casual is also referred to as smart
casual.) In some parts of the United States (and other countries), this style of
dress or work attire has taken the place of formal business wear or interna-
tional standard business attire (suits, neckties, and dress shoes).
Just to make everything even more confusing, business casual and Friday
casual are different:
 Business casual (or casual) for men generally means khaki pants, dress
slacks in linen or wool, Dockers, or corduroys with a sports jacket,
button-down shirt, or sweater, and a casual loafer or Dr. Martens shoes.
 Friday casual includes all the preceding items but adds jeans, tennis
shoes, and, in some workplaces, T-shirts. This doesn’t include inappro-
priate items, such as shorts, revealing tops, or soiled or ragged clothing.
Taking stock of what you have
Begin by thinking about your profession and your place of work, and your
leisure time. If the two are very different, separate your work wardrobe from
your leisure or casual wardrobe. Before you pull out the credit card and head
for the mall, take inventory of what you currently own by following these steps:
1. Take everything out of your closets, drawers, boxes, and laundry 
baskets.
2. Divide your clothes, shoes, and accessories into piles. The rule to
remember is that if you haven’t worn the item in six months, get rid of 
52
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

it! Please be environmentally conscious and try your best to toss out as
little as possible. Take into consideration whether the item of clothing
can be donated or used for another purpose. Leather shoes can take up
to 40 years to decompose.
• Everything with holes, stains, or rips goes into the “fix or toss” pile.
• Everything that doesn’t fit right now goes into the “donate” or
“sell” pile.
• Separate clothing that you consider as wearable, yet casual, non-
work clothing.
• Separate everything that may qualify as business attire.
3. Look carefully at all items that qualify as business attire, including
formal and informal (business casual).
Do they really fit? Try them on to be sure. If they don’t, move them to
the donate or sell stack. Are they worn out or hopelessly out-of-date? If
so (be honest), they go to the donate or sell pile.
4. Divide the clothes in the “fix or toss” pile into those items that can be
repaired and those that cannot.
If clothes can be repaired, take them to a good tailor or to Goodwill. Try
to recycle items whenever possible.
Now you should have examined your entire wardrobe and accessories
enough to know what you own.
Casual Workplace Wear for Women
Casual business attire (or business casual) for women requires some thought
because women have so many choices. Keep to the KISS principle — Keep It
Simple and Sophisticated — even with casual clothes. Dark colors convey
authority; bright colors convey friendliness. Light colors, such as taupe and
khaki, generally are more casual than black, gray, and navy.
Because all casual clothing is not suitable for the office, the following guide-
lines can help you determine what is appropriate to wear to work. Here are 
a few tips to get you started:
 Start with the following items:
• A dark jacket and several high-quality cotton shirts and plain white
blouses.
• Dark skirts or pants (boot-cut or straight leg) and one or two
dresses (sheath style). Select colors in a dark neutral shade such
as black, brown, navy blue, or gray.
53
Chapter 4: Look Sharp! Creating Professional Style and Presence

• Three to four pairs of high-quality leather shoes (in brown, black,
and navy).
 Twin sets or other sweaters (cardigans) — which can be a great place to
add color — provide more finish than just a shirt or blouse but are less
formal than a jacket.
 Ensembles are casual variations on the traditional suit. Many items come
in coordinated fabrics that you can mix and match. Pair them with a
crisp white or colored blouse or a light sweater and/or jacket, an A-line
or straight (pencil) skirt, and slacks or pants. You may wear matching
jackets, pants, and skirts together for a more formal look or as separates
for a more casual look.
 Dark colors are a good first choice for jackets, pants, and skirts because
they wear well. Add blouses and shirts, scarves, belts, shoes, and jew-
elry in interesting colors and textures.
 Consider having your colors analyzed by a color expert. By knowing
what color looks best (and worst) on you, you can choose items to buy
and wear that will always enhance your appearance. Even without
having your colors done professionally, you can normally tell what
colors look best on you. Take a moment to see how the color makes you
feel. If you’re shopping, ask a salesperson’s opinion. Also, take notice of
the color you’re wearing when you receive compliments like “Gee, that
color looks great on you!” Eventually, you’ll figure it out.
A number of small things can kill a positive impression. Try to avoid these
image and fashion mistakes:
 Excessive use of bright color and wild patterns
 Excessive jewelry or jewelry that signals your arrival with tiny clinking
sounds
 Shoes that always “match” your blouse
 Any sheer fabrics that show your undergarments
 Undergarment straps showing and visible panty lines
 Wrinkled or stained clothing
 Loose hems
 Spiky, strappy sandals in metallic colors or with rhinestones, or open-
toed shoes (not appropriate for most businesses)
 Missing buttons
 Dirty or overly bleached or colored hair or obvious roots
 Chipped nail polish
 Chewing gum

Business-casual dress codes have been established to allow employees to
work comfortably in the workplace while still projecting a professional image
on the job, with customers or clients.
Formal Business Clothes for Women
You’re well advised to stay conservative at a formal workplace until it’s blaz-
ingly obvious that you don’t have to. You’ll want to have some suits and
appropriate, conservative coordinates in your business wardrobe.
Suits
The keys to suits (either skirt suits or pantsuits) are fabric, fit, and comfort:
 For autumn, winter, and spring, wool is still the best choice. For summer,
cotton, gabardines, and linen are good choices, especially if blended
with a small amount of polyester and other stretchy fabrics. Tropic
weight wool and other wool blends are another good option. (I explain
these types of fabrics in the later section about men’s suits.)
If you work in an office, you can occasionally wear leather effectively,
but the key to doing so is keeping it understated and tailored. Any hints
of the motorcycle world or other dark regions are off-limits.
 Have the suit professionally fitted if you have problems with off-the-rack
clothes. Choose suits with jackets and skirts that are appropriate for
your body type. Long jackets that cover the hips can be flattering to
some women, yet many of the short styles today also look professional.
Buy clothes that you can wear now rather than clothes you may be able
to wear someday, if only. . . .
 Comfortable clothing is essential not only because it’s distracting to be
constantly tugging, pulling, or adjusting an item, but also because
clothes that are either too loose, too tight, too long, or too short look
unprofessional.
Navy blue, black, charcoal gray, taupe, white, burgundy, and forest green are
acceptable business colors. Although dark colors typically are worn in winter,
winter white is also making a fashion statement. Light colors are worn in the
spring and summer. This rule really is no longer hard and fast. Some women
can wear red, but oranges, yellows, bright purples, and other loud colors are
best used in small amounts.
55
Chapter 4: Look Sharp! Creating Professional Style and Presence

Skirts
The most important things to concern yourself with here are fit and length:
 Don’t make your skirt too tight, and don’t make it too short. Sit down in
front of a mirror. If you’re concerned about the view in any way, the skirt
is too short. Likewise, if you must walk like a geisha, the skirt is too tight.
 If you appear to have just arrived from Queen Victoria’s court, the skirt
is too long. Straight skirts are preferred over full or pleated skirts, all
other things being equal. But all other things are rarely equal, so if you
wear full or pleated skirts, make them longer than straight skirts.
Business skirts typically are hemmed just around the knee.
Pantsuits
You find pantsuits, which are flattering for most women, in almost every
venue of the contemporary business world. Keep the colors muted: blue,
black, charcoal, taupe, burgundy, and some greens are good choices. And
make sure that your pantsuit is fitted properly.
Blouses and shirts
What you wear with your suit is as important as the suit itself. Blouses made
of transparent material are inappropriate. High-quality cotton and silk are
good choices, as are high-quality microfiber blends. Collars on women’s
blouses and shirts are much more varied than those on men’s shirts. Have
fun, but avoid the Tinker Bell look. Choose opaque materials for business
shirts, and coordinate your blouse color with your suit color. Whatever you
do, avoid wearing tank tops or any low-cut top. What about today’s trend of
wearing lingerie as outerwear? Some of these slip style of tops can be worn
under jackets; however, it doesn’t come across as professional, so save them
for evenings.
Any attire that reveals too much cleavage, skin, your midriff, or your undergar-
ments is not appropriate for the workplace, even in a casual business setting.
Stockings and pantyhose
Pantyhose and stockings are both acceptable in the workplace, so long as
they’re matched to your other clothes, aren’t heavily patterned, and don’t
suggest anything other than a commitment to work. Currently, very sheer
56
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

skin-toned stockings are the standard, although some people prefer black or
gray with dark skirts. During warm months, or if you feel comfortable doing
so, going without pantyhose is fine (though wearing underwear is always
advisable).
Shoes
Even if you’ve never bothered to visit the cobbler, in business, I strongly
advise you to take care of your shoes. Keep them functional, attractive, clean,
and shined.
Have you found a scuff on your favorite pair of black pumps? Keep a black
marker with you to touch up scuffed shoes.
Most women find that low-heeled pumps or flats are suitable for the vast
majority of business situations. They’re good-looking, comfortable, and avail-
able in sufficient variety to coordinate with anything you may be wearing.
Make sure that you have at least one or two pairs of good-quality black shoes
to wear year-round.
Never wear white shoes (except sneakers) before Memorial Day or after
Labor Day — unless you’re a bride.
Heels can be as high as, say, 11⁄2 or 2 inches, but heels much higher than that
look unprofessional. Keep the higher heels for your skirts; 2-inch heels with a
pantsuit are too dressy for day.
Open-toed sandals or shoes and mules are popular but inappropriate in con-
servative establishments. Hiking boots, clogs, running shoes, spike heels, and
platforms are appropriate for specialty businesses only.
Accessories
Welcome to the bottomless pit of accessories! What if you don’t know 397
ways to tie a scarf? What if you don’t know anything about jewelry or hand-
bags? Don’t worry; you can still save your wardrobe by keeping it simple and
sophisticated.
Handbags
Handbags should be large enough to carry a few items of makeup and what-
ever technology you use to plan your week, but no larger. Your handbag
shouldn’t be able to carry your weekly groceries or your dry cleaning.
57
Chapter 4: Look Sharp! Creating Professional Style and Presence

Don’t skimp on quality; buy the best handbag you can afford. Dark leather is
by far the best choice; save the bright colors for social occasions. Though
they are quite fashionable, avoid spangles, sparkles, and jewels on handbags
unless you work at the local retro fashion shop.
Briefcases
You still find briefcases at the end of most businesspeople’s arms. Some
women carry a briefcase in lieu of a handbag, which is much neater. If you
must carry an additional handbag, keep it small.
Increasingly, the briefcase and notebook computer bag are merging into one
article. Briefcases traditionally are made of black or brown leather, and again,
black is the dressier of the two. Don’t skimp on quality. For a more profes-
sional look, coordinate your handbag color with your briefcase color. If you
choose a separate notebook computer bag in addition to a briefcase and
handbag, make sure that they all coordinate.
In some professions, canvas or ballistic-nylon bags are de rigueur. Watch those
around you to see whether this alternative is common in your business.
Belts
Belts should be leather and 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch thick, though if they’re worn properly,
some of the wider belts, worn lower on the hips, can look stylish. Coordinate
their color with your outfit. Avoid metallic belts, belts covered with studs,
bejeweled belts, and belts made of plastic or fur. Buckles should be subdued
and smallish, made of metal or leather.
Proper attire dictates that when a garment (such as pants) has belt loops,
you are supposed to wear a belt to be fully and properly dressed.
Scarves
Scarves are readily acceptable in all but the stuffiest workplaces. They should
be made of silk, wool, cashmere, or a blend of these fabrics. Cotton scarves
rarely hang properly for long.
Some part of the scarf should match some color in your outfit. Although you
can wear a scarf in different ways — under a jacket, draped over the shoul-
der, as an ascot, in your hair — always make sure that it looks as though it’s
meant to be there, rather than as though you forgot to put your towel back
on the rack after your shower. Avoid really loud scarves, metallic scarves,
and scarves with obvious topography.
Jewelry
Some women are nuts about jewelry — the more, the better. But in business,
this enthusiasm is best replaced with another maxim: Less is more. Keep
your jewelry simple and understated.
58
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Very delicate jewelry looks best on small-boned women. Clunky jewelry is
best on big-boned gals. Here are a few additional jewelry tips:
 Earrings can be of precious metal, such as silver or gold, and can con-
tain diamonds or pearls. Hollow hoops, so long as they are smallish, are
acceptable as well. Match your earrings’ size, shape, and color to your
necklace (if you’re wearing one), and make sure that any color coordi-
nates with your garment colors. Even if larger earrings are in vogue, save
the enormous or jangly ones for social occasions, especially if your job
requires you to make presentations. You don’t want the audience to be
distracted by your jewelry.
 Necklaces can be of precious metal, such as silver or gold, or of pearls.
Match your necklace shape to the collar shape of your blouse or other
garment. A V-shaped necklace with a round collar doesn’t cut it.
 Watches can be either analog or digital. All things considered, analog
watches (those with faces and hands) are still better than digital watches.
A large digital or sports watch that boasts an altimeter and a computer
isn’t appropriate, even if you did wear it on your last trip to Mount
Everest.
Choose your watch band carefully. Make sure that it complements your
other jewelry and garments. Leather (black or brown) and matte metal
bands are acceptable, with a slight edge going to black leather. Also,
avoid joke watches, cartoon watches, and watches that are hard to read
or require a professional maintenance team.
 Brooches and pins should be worn only when you don’t wear a neck-
lace. Make sure that the brooch is large enough not to be lost but not so
large as to draw attention to itself or look like a Star Trek communica-
tions badge. Brooch shape is best coordinated with suit style: edgy with
blunt-cut jackets and V-necked and square-necked blouses; rounded
with round-necked blouses.
 Rings should be simple and few. Big sparklers are not appropriate at
the office unless they’re part of your engagement ring. Your best bet is
to limit rings to a wedding ring/engagement ring/anniversary ring set. If
you must, you may add a small class ring or family heirloom on the ring
finger of your right hand.
Eyeglasses
A person who wears glasses has the greatest responsibility to choose a pair
that fits their face and personality. Eyeglasses frame your face and either
bring out your best features or, if they’re the wrong style, detract from your
features. For most people, finding the right look and fit for your face is the
absolute toughest thing to achieve. There are just too many choices out there
from which to choose! As with other fashion, be sure the style fits your pro-
fession. If you work in a law firm, you may not want to wear glasses with
bright red frames.
59
Chapter 4: Look Sharp! Creating Professional Style and Presence

At one time, large bright-colored or metallic glasses were thought to bring
authority to women in business. Those days are gone, and so are all the tired
facial muscles that went along with these glasses.
Today’s look in eyeglasses is small and stylish. Glasses are among the few
areas in business dress where you’re allowed to assert your individuality
even in conservative environments. Like ties, glasses are a small enough part
of the overall look to accommodate creativity without ruining the outfit. With
this choice, of course, comes the responsibility to assert yourself with care.
You can certainly wear your red glasses with the pineapple inlays on the tem-
ples, but you may also want to have a more subdued pair on hand if you’re
meeting with old Mr. Fuddyduddy to discuss his annuity portfolio.
Never wear tinted glasses in the office; they make you look shady! Lenses
that change color with available light are acceptable, however.
Casual Workplace Wear for Men
Business casual can be a tough assignment for some men. While most men
understand formal or business dress (suit, white shirt, tie, polished dress
shoes), they have difficulty when the occasion calls for attire that falls some-
where between formal business dress and casual dress. One of the biggest
reasons that men struggle with sharp casual clothing is there is some gray
area with company policies and the guidelines of business casual.
As I explained in the earlier section “Defining ‘business casual’ and ‘casual,’”
business casual and Friday casual are distinct from one another:
 Business casual generally means khaki pants, a plain polo shirt or a long-
sleeved casual button-down oxford shirt, a V-neck sweater, sometimes 
a sports coat or blazer, and brown leather shoes. Loafers are a good
choice, and you should wear socks.
 Friday casual includes all the above, and in some companies can include
jeans, T-shirts, and tennis shoes, but this does not mean ratty or torn
jeans, and it never means cutoffs or an old T-shirt with something offen-
sive written on it.
Don’t forget these general guidelines:
 A short-sleeved shirt is, by definition, always a casual shirt.
 Khaki and flannel pants are casual for most businesses.
 Tank tops, shorts, and sandals are weekend wear, not business wear.
60
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

 Advertising, artist, and fashion types can wear leather jackets.
 Plain shirts are best in general; shirts with ads on them are for fishing.
 Button-down oxford shirts are casual; T-shirts are for musicians and
computer types (and for mowing the lawn).
 Loafers and dark walking shoes are casual; clean sneakers, running
shoes, and hiking boots are for play but can make occasional appear-
ances on Fridays.
 Blazers and sports coats are casual for some businesses and dressy for
others.
Formal Business Clothes for Men
Men don’t have as many options as women do. Formal means a suit of some
sort, but dressing well means much more than just slapping on a suit, as I
explain in the following sections.
Suits
If you’re a professional, you probably own at least a few suits: two or three
made of wool and other blends for autumn and winter and one made of
cotton or tropic weight wool and microfibers for spring and summer. When
choosing a suit, look first for fabric, fit, and comfort; look second for style.
Fabrics include wool, cotton, linen, and various microfibers. Wool is easily
the most versatile fabric, coming in summer or tropic weight and winter
weight and in a variety of fabric styles. Worsted wool is composed of tightly
twisted fibers; gabardine and crepe are worsted wools. Various woolen fab-
rics, such as tweed and flannel, are more loosely twisted. Wool blends are
fabrics in which wool is woven with microfibers such as nylon or polyester.
Although wool-blend suits aren’t as traditional as worsted wools or tweed,
they are strong and durable, and they feel good.
Cotton and linen suits are also available. One classic cotton suit is the seer-
sucker, a vertically striped affair rarely found off the East Coast or out of 
the Deep South. Linen suits are popular in some quarters because they’re
comfortable in extreme heat and high humidity. But be forewarned: Linen
wrinkles immediately. Although these two fabrics have their adherents,
tropic-weight wool is still by far the most popular choice for a summer suit.
Your suit fabric should never shine or change colors in different lighting.

Chapter 4: Look Sharp! Creating Professional Style and Presence

You can choose among three basic suit styles (and their multiple variations):
 American cut: These suits can have two or three buttons. They have
center-vented jackets with natural shoulders, and pants with a straight
line.
 Italian cut: These suits have unvented jackets with padded shoulders,
and pants that are fuller than those in American-cut suits.
 British cut: These suits have side-vented or unvented jackets with square
shoulders and a tapered waist, and pants that are narrower than those
in both American-cut and Italian-cut suits.
When standing or walking, button the top button of a two-button jacket;
button the middle button of a three-button jacket. Unbutton your jacket when
sitting down. If you button all the buttons on a suit, you’ll look like you did
when you were a 4-year-old ring bearer at your Aunt Ellie’s wedding.
Double-breasted suits rarely look as good as you think they will.
The only rule about fit is that you have the suit professionally tailored.
Purchasing a $1,500 suit off the rack is absolutely pointless if it won’t be 
tailored to fit you. As I mention earlier in this chapter, regardless of the price
tag of the garment, if it doesn’t fit properly, it ruins the entire image. Normally
clothing that is more expensive is well-made and fits better, so buying high
quality can pay off in the long run. Most good men’s clothing stores and
department stores have tailors, and many times alterations are a complimen-
tary service. Even if you think the suit looks great and fits properly, get the
opinion of a good tailor first. Long sleeves, long jackets, long pants, and
shoulders that are too large destroy the overall appearance.
If the back of the collar of the suit has a gap, it does not fit well. The collar
should always be sitting on the back of your neck, even when you move
about. That shows it is a well-fitted suit.
As for color, navy blue, black, charcoal gray, and dark brown are the standard
colors for business suits. Navy blue and charcoal gray wool are excellent
choices for first suits. Conservative pinstriped suits are acceptable in some
businesses, as are some patterned suits. Khaki and tan make appearances in
late spring and summer only. An exception: You can wear the camel-hair
sports coat year-round.
Brush off your jackets and pants at the end of each day and before you leave
the house in the morning. If you don’t have a clothing brush, you can use
masking tape or a pet tape roller.

Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Pants
Traditional dress slacks or more casual khakis, corduroys, and wool and linen
pants are appropriate, either with or without a jacket or blazer, though a
sports jacket can pull the look together. No matter what style of pant you
wear, always make sure they are ironed neatly and fit properly.
Shirts
Buy five long-sleeved white shirts and five long-sleeved light blue shirts.
(There’s no such thing as a short-sleeved dress shirt.) If you work in a 
conservative environment, you’ve just finished your shirt shopping!
Collar styles come and go. Currently, spread collars, point collars of various
extremes, and button-down collars all have their purposes:
 Spread collars are considered to be dressiest because you can’t wear
them without a tie.
 Point collars are the best compromise collars because they look good
with or without a tie.
 Hidden button-downs are increasingly popular. Button-down collars are
still quite popular for certain professions (such as academia and pub-
lishing) and for casual-wear days.
Socks
Socks are simple: Like shoes, socks should be at least as dark as your suit or
pants when it comes to formal and business-casual attire. Wear dark socks
coordinated with the color of your suit. Wear khaki or dark brown socks with
khakis. Patterns are permissible so long as they’re not ostentatious. Socks
should be cotton, wool, or silk. Polyester socks will create problems I’d
rather not discuss here. Socks should be mid-calf or full calf in length to pre-
vent your untanned shins from blinding others.
White socks are unacceptable in business. And in case the thought crosses
your mind, wearing no socks is equally unacceptable.
63
Chapter 4: Look Sharp! Creating Professional Style and Presence

Shoes
Match your footwear to your clothing and the occasion. Wearing wing tips
with a casual pant or khaki is too dressy; wearing an informal loafer style is
best. Laced shoes are more appropriate with a formal suit. Well-shined shoes
show you care about detail. Like socks, shoes are relatively simple: Plain- and
cap-toed oxfords, wingtips, and plain or tasseled loafers are the extent of
your choices for dress business shoes. There are suede styles that can be
worn for a more casual look.
Your shoes should be at least as dark as your suit. Coordinate your shoe
color with your suit color: black shoes with charcoal gray, black, and navy
blue suits, and brown shoes with brown and tan suits.
To prolong the life of your shoes, keep shoetrees in your closet and use them
to retain your shoes’ shape and size. Also, keep a shoeshine kit in your closet
and polish your shoes at least once a week or wipe them down the day you
wear them. And, if heels get worn down, have them replaced.
Keep a black marker with you to touch up scuffed shoes.
Accessories
You’re probably thinking, “Real men don’t accessorize!” Think again. The little
things are what matter most.
Briefcases
Briefcases traditionally are black or brown leather. Don’t skimp on quality. 
If you choose a notebook computer bag instead, hold it to the same high-
quality standards you would a briefcase.
64
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 
The debate of the ages: Do you wear 
black or brown shoes with navy blue?
There are two trains of thought when it comes to
the color of shoe you wear with navy blue (for
both men and women). There are some rules of
fashion that state all shades of blue are incom-
patible with any shades of brown, and black
shoes always will be de rigueur with navy blue
suits. (Take notice of military uniforms.) Then
there are those who believe brown is seen as
more sophisticated than black and that a brown
shoe can look elegant. However, this only applies
if the shoes are a dark hue of brown, not light
brown or tan. If your brown shoes are of a dark-
ness approaching black, you’re in good shape.

Belts
Belts should match or closely match the color and texture of your shoes.
Your socks should match your pants. Brown shoes, brown belt; black shoes,
black belt; and so on.
Ties
Ah, the tie! Do you use it to express your individuality or your bank balance?
Or do you think that attempting to express your inner soul through your tie 
is lame? Either way, follow these simple rules with ties:
 Ties should be silk.
 Ties should be understated.
 Ties should be coordinated with the suit and shirt.
 Ties should end at the top of your belt.
Play it safe. If you’re partial to the unusual, keep an extra clean white shirt
and a couple of plain or understated ties in your office, just in case your con-
servative client pays a surprise visit. Don’t wear Mickey Mouse ties unless
other people in your office wear Bugs Bunny or Dilbert.
The bow tie is a special case. If you work in a think tank or at an Ivy League
university, bow ties are acceptable. But outside the tradition-obsessed halls
of academia and jurisprudence, the bow tie is often (perhaps unfairly) treated
with suspicion. So be careful: If you love yourself in a bow tie and think that
there aren’t enough bow-tied men in the world, go for it.
Watches
If you go for status symbols, buy an expensive watch. Otherwise, a medium-
range watch with a leather or metal band is the way to go.
Eyeglasses
As with women, a man who wears glasses should select a pair that fits his
face and personality. Choose a pair that is flattering. Try to update the style
of your glasses every three to four years. Wearing styles that went out of
style years ago can age a person. Take the time to see what’s new. Looking
through a men’s fashion magazine can be helpful.
Hats
Forty years ago, fedoras were the hats of choice. Today, the only hat of choice,
it seems, is the baseball cap. Let these rules suffice: Make sure that baseball
caps are insignia free, and don’t wear them indoors at any time. Other hats —
especially winter hats that offer varying degrees of arctic protection — are
acceptable out in the elements but not in the building.
65
Chapter 4: Look Sharp! Creating Professional Style and Presence

You Clean Up Well! Personal 
Hygiene and Grooming
Wearing the right clothes does no good if you haven’t bathed or your nails
are dirty. Bathe or shower every day, and use a deodorant or antiperspirant;
then use the specific guidelines in the following sections.
Hands
Everyone should follow these guidelines for hands:
 Keep your hands and fingernails scrupulously clean and well cared for.
 Don’t bite your nails or cuticles.
 Keep your cuticles pushed back.
 Get an occasional professional manicure. Both men and women benefit
from this treatment.
Women should follow these guidelines for nails:
 Clear nail polish is easy to maintain. If you wear colored nail polish,
stick to red or pink, and get a professional manicure weekly. Do your
best to never go out with chipped nail polish. Keep a color handy at
work for the occasional accident.
 Nails should be no longer than half an inch beyond the end of your
fingers. If you can’t pick up a dime with your fingertips, your nails are
too long.
Men, your rules are simple: Nails should be clean, short, buffed, and filed.
Hair
Hair should be clean, well-combed, and trimmed. Eliminate dandruff with a
good shampoo. Other than that, almost anything goes. (Everyone looks bad
in a mullet, of course.)
Ladies, keep your hair out of your eyes. If your hair is long, consider pulling it
back, but avoid looking like a schoolgirl. Barrettes and other ornamentation
should be simple.
66
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

Men, keep your hair trimmed and orderly. Long hair is acceptable in some
companies but not in others. If yours is too long for the company where
you’ve been hired, you’ll be told so. If you aren’t told, ask. If your hair is long,
consider pulling it back in a ponytail. If you have a beard or other facial hair,
keep it trimmed and free of crumbs. If necessary, shave your neck and upper
chest to below your T-shirt line. Eyebrows, nostrils, and ears should be free
of stragglers at all times. Shave every day and before leaving the office, if nec-
essary, if you have an evening appointment.
Face
Wash your face daily. If you have acne, consult a dermatologist; many excel-
lent treatments are available.
Also, you should brush your teeth after every meal. Equip your office with a
toothbrush, toothpaste, breath mints, and mouthwash.
A woman’s makeup should enhance her natural features, not create new
ones. A foundation that matches her skin tone, lipstick, mascara, and a light
dusting of powder are often enough. Heavy eyeliner, metallic or bright-
colored eye shadow, and thick rouge are only for the stage.
Scents
Use perfume or aftershave/cologne sparingly so that it neither precedes you
nor lingers after you.
Piercings and tattoos
Tattoos shouldn’t be visible during the business day. In more conservative
business settings, remove your piercing ornaments during the day.
Sending All the Right Signals: Body
Language and Comportment
Clothes may make the person, but body language may make or break the deal.
How you carry yourself when engaged in conversation is often as important
as what you say. Body language is nonverbal, but it communicates volumes
about you nonetheless. Paying attention to your body language communi-
cates to others that you pay attention to detail.
67
Chapter 4: Look Sharp! Creating Professional Style and Presence

Body language is an interpretive affair. Like most human behavior, your phys-
ical behavior is symbolic. Take some simple examples:
 Failure to maintain eye contact during conversations is a sign of eva-
siveness and cowardice to some people. In some cultures, however,
avoiding eye contact is polite behavior.
 Stroking your chin while thinking is supposed by some people to indi-
cate reflection and deep thought. But sometimes, your chin just itches.
The truth is that practically any behavior you engage in can be freighted with
significance. You may scratch your ear one evening in a bar and, unknown to
you, signal the man with the newspaper that the diamonds are in the
umbrella stand.
With almost infinite symbolic interpretations for body language, no wonder
people are nervous about it! Your best bet is to know about some of the
body-language pits you can fall into and how to avoid them.
Standing
When you stand, you want to stand with your back straight, middle section in
alignment with your back, shoulders back, and head up. This posture connotes
comfort with yourself and ease in the situation.
Slouching, sticking your belly out, stuffing your hands in your pockets, and
folding your arms defensively all suggest aggressive unease. Winding yourself
up like a corkscrew, with your ankles crossed and your arms holding them-
selves, is the very picture of insecurity and nervousness.
Sitting
Take care in the way you sit, for no other position connotes so much on its
own. Think of the diversity of sitting positions that you’ve seen in business
meetings, from practically horizontal to alert and upright. Sit with a straight
back and with your legs together in front of you or crossed, either at the knee
or at the ankle. Normally, women don’t cross their legs, but men are allowed.
Given male and female physiology, the position of your legs while sitting can
send some primeval signals to those around you. Take care that the signals
you send are neither overtly nor covertly aggressive or sexual:
 Jiggling your knee is a sign of nervousness.
 Leaning forward can suggest aggressiveness at times, so do so with
care.
68
Part I: Conducting Yourself Gracefully in the Business World 

 Leaning back with your hands behind your head and your pelvis lifted
is an unseemly display for a man. So is sitting with your legs open if no
desk shields your conversation partner from you. Avoid sitting with one
ankle over the other knee in all but the most casual settings.
 Leaning back with your legs crossed and one side off the seat of the
chair is an unseemly display for a woman. So is sitting like a sexy star-
let on a late-night talk show.
Hands
Some people talk with their hands; others stand there with their hands glued
to their sides. Most people haven’t the foggiest notion what their hands are
doing when they talk.
Using your hands can be effective sometimes, aggressive sometimes, and
irrelevant most of the time. Using your index finger can be effective in empha-
sizing a point. But plenty of chest-pointing bosses use their hands in a barely
controlled way to assert their power over you.
Controlling your hands takes effort and willpower. Monitor your hand move-
ments. Avoid making sweeping, cappuccino-clearing gestures during meet-
ings. If you have to, sit on your hands.
Head movements
Head movements communicate important information. Nodding in agreement
can be immensely helpful to others, but too much nodding makes you look
like one of those bobbing dogs in the back window of a car. Shaking your
head can signal disagreement or disapproval, but avoid shaking your head
too much.
Facial expressions
Facial expressions are crucial in your repertoire of body language. No other
part of your body can convey the immense richness of nonverbal communi-
cation that your face does. For example:
 You already know that smiles are important signals of generosity and
nonaggression. But forced smiles are neither: They’re signals that you
can barely tolerate the other person. And incessant smiles are signals of
servility or foolishness.
 Likewise, frowns signal disagreement, disapproval, and sometimes anger.
But they can also suggest hard thinking and focused concentration.
69
Chapter 4: Look Sharp! Creating Professional Style and Presence

These facial expressions are the most obvious ones, but hundreds of others
exist: an arched eyebrow, pursed lips, flared nostrils, squinting eyes, a wrin-
kled nose, a bitten lip, a tongue out of the mouth, a grimace, widely opened
eyes . . . and on and on. Every one of them has a culturally agreed-on set of
meanings.
Take a day to monitor your most frequently used facial expressions, and when
the inventory is complete, assess their appropriateness and their effective-
ness. You’ll probably be surprised by the kinds of things you weren’t even
aware that you do!
You can learn to control all these emotions and develop a poker face, of course.
Some people think that a poker face is a great thing to have in business.
Eyes
Maintain eye contact when talking with others. Do not study your hands or
clean your fingernails while others are talking. When talking in a group, make
eye contact with everyone; don’t focus on only one person.

In This Chapter
 Making graceful introductions
 Shaking hands with skill
I
n today’s fast-paced, high-tech world, people tend to forget the importance
of simple human contact and kindness — remembering people’s names,
trying to make a good first impression, and greeting people with a firm hand-
shake. I’m asked many business etiquette questions; invariably, I find that
many of them center on introductions. Rightly so. Even though people may
have loosened up somewhat in their use of titles, you still find a very distinct
pecking order in who is introduced to whom in the business world.
Being able to introduce people and explain who they are makes everyone feel
comfortable in a new situation and is one of the most useful skills you can
acquire in the business world. The ability to introduce yourself or others con-
fidently demonstrates that you are at ease and in control — and by extension,
you set others at ease too. In this chapter, I introduce you to the proper tech-
niques for meeting and greeting people that will make you look — and be —
completely at ease in public.
Making Introductions with Ease
The goal for making introductions is to provide information about each other
in order to give you a common ground to carry on a conversation. How many
times have you been at a business event where you were the one in a group
not introduced to anyone? Or the person doing the introduction forgot your
name? How did that make you feel? Not so good, right? Knowing how to make
a graceful introduction will not only allow you to concentrate on making a
positive impression but it will also empower you. The following section pro-
vides general guidelines on how to make a proper introduction in various
business situations.

Deciding who makes the introductions
The rules of who makes introductions depend on the situation:
 In formal business situations, your host (generally, the most senior exec-
utive from the company that planned the event) meets, greets, and 
introduces you to other guests. If your company is hosting the event,
and you’re the only or most senior representative of your company in 
a group, your job is to assume the role of host and make introductions.
 In less-formal situations, you don the role of host for your immediate
circle and facilitate introductions.
 If you enter a group in which introductions have already been made,
introducing yourself is always appropriate and in most instances
expected.
Understanding the pecking order
Who goes first? Traditionally, in social situations a man is introduced to a
woman.
The most common mistake made in introductions is the failure to keep all
honorifics equal. If you use Ms Hughes, you must use Mr. Cunningham. You
could use Karen Hughes and John Cunningham, although this would make it 
a less formal introduction. Of utmost importance to keep in mind is never to
use first names only.
Introducing someone junior to someone senior
In business, introductions are based on a person’s rank and position in a
company. Whether that person is a man or a woman, young or old, makes 
no difference. You always introduce, or present, a “lesser” person to a more-
senior person. You name the senior person first and the person who is being
introduced, or presented, last.
If you’re introducing a junior account executive named Alex Goldberg to the
vice president of your division, Joanne Michaels, the proper form is “Joanne
Michaels, I’d like to introduce Alex Goldberg. He is an account executive with
Jones & Co. and Joanne Michaels is our division’s vice president.”
If someone uses her first and last names when introducing herself, the proper
response is to still use her proper honorific or title and her last name: “Hello,
my name is Janice Jones.” Response: “Hello, Ms Jones” or “How do you do,
Ms Jones.” Don’t use her first name unless she invites you to do so. If the
person is of equal rank, you can feel comfortable using both his first and last
names, if that’s how the person introduces himself. I discuss titles and forms
of address in more detail later in this chapter.
74
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

Introducing your boss to a client
It must be noted a client always takes precedence over your boss or the owner
or president of your company. You introduce the president of your company,
Chris Rosati, to the vice-president of your client’s company, Myra Pay, as fol-
lows: “Ms Pay, I’d like to introduce Mr. Rosati, the president of Acme Graphics.”
You use “Ms Pay” if you normally address her this way. If you normally address
your client as “Myra,” then the introduction should be “Myra Pay, I’d like to
introduce Chris Rosati, the president of Acme Graphics. Ms Pay will say, “How
do you do, Mr. Rosati.” Mr. Rosati will reply, “How do you do, Ms Pay.” They
may both say, “Please call me Myra/Chris.”
“How do you do” is not really a question. The correct response is “How do
you do” or “Hello,” but never “Hi.”
Introducing two people of equal rank
When you’re introducing two people of equal rank in the corporate hierarchy,
introduce the person who is not in your company to the person in your com-
pany. If you and Mike Hirschman are both vice presidents in your company’s
Chicago office and you see Valerie Martinez, a vice president in the Los
Angeles office, you say, “Valerie Martinez, I’d like to introduce Mike Hirschman.
Valerie is vice president of our Los Angeles office, and Mike works here with
me in our Chicago office.” Because everyone is of equal rank, the key in this
example is to honor the guest from another office over your pal in the same
office. As a result, her name is said first. If you happen to introduce peers 
to one another, a simple, “Carol, this is Karen Miller, Karen, meet Carol Andre;
Carol works in our marketing department” will do.
Introducing people in a group
In a large group, introduce several people to one person at a time, following
the hierarchy by using the “important” person’s name first. Depending on the
rank of the people in the group, the “important” person’s name is first; the
person or persons being introduced, or presented to the important person, 
is named last.
“Mr. Rogers, I’d like to present Lauren Lundsten and Michele Swanberg. They’re
summer interns from USC working for our firm for the next three months.
Lauren and Michele, this is Mr. Andrew Rogers, the senior partner of our law
firm.”
If you’re in a group and making many introductions, it’s helpful to give people
a little information about one another to help them start a conversation. You
don’t want to make an introduction without offering something about each
other’s company or position and how they may relate to each other. You
might say, “Mr. Raymond Godfrey, I would like to present Mr. Dwight Schaffer,
who is the president of our company. Mr. Godfrey is the president of Express
Shipping, and also serves on the International Shipping Council.”
75
Chapter 5: The Art of Meeting and Greeting

Introducing yourself
You often have to introduce yourself in business situations. If you’re waiting
in a conference room for a meeting to begin, and someone new to you arrives,
you stand, offer your hand, and introduce yourself and your role: “Hi, I’m
Mike Perez. I’m chair of the Echelon Promotion Board.” At that point, the
other person can introduce herself to you: “How do you do, Mr. Perez. I’m
Linda Pollack, and I’m going to be handling PR for the new communications
campaign.” Be sure to always use both your first and last name, not just your
first name.
Never leave people guessing about your name. To save someone the possible
embarrassment of forgetting your name, always offer a handshake and state
both your first and last name. “Hello, I’m Allison Pay.” Now the person can
easily introduce you around. Even if the person remembers your name and
says, “Of course, Allison; how could I forget you!” everyone will be comfort-
able and happy, and you’ll have smoothed over a potentially awkward
moment simply by saying your name right away.
Applying titles and forms of address
What’s in a title? A whole heck of a lot. In a business situation, titles are cru-
cial in introductions, because they put the people being introduced into 
context for others. Is he a marketing person, a salesperson, an engineer, an
accountant? This information is critical to making sure that everyone is com-
fortable with one another (and immediately opens the door to conversation
that can ease initial awkwardness). People want to know to whom they are
speaking so that they can make appropriate comments.
Never assume that you can automatically call someone by a first name. You
should use a person’s proper honorific until he invites you to use the first
name. Stick with Mr., Ms, Doctor, General — whatever is right. In the case of 
a woman, if you’re not sure which variation she prefers — Mrs. or Ms — just
ask her. If you know that the woman is a physician, a PhD, or a military offi-
cer, use the appropriate title.
In contemporary society, a grown woman is never a “Miss.” Only young girls
under 18 are addressed as Miss.
If someone has been an ambassador, a governor, a senator, or a judge, he
remains so all his life. Always use the title in front of the person’s family
name.
Americans tend to jump to the first name very quickly, as any recent phone
solicitation will convince you. This trend is an epidemic; regrettably, hosts
and superiors often set the wrong example. When in doubt, err on the side 
of formality.
76
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

Remembering names (and behaving 
properly if you forget)
Everyone has problems remembering names, at least now and then (and
sometimes more often). What’s the best way to handle this embarrassment?
First, try to recall and share something — anything — you do remember
about the person, such as, “I know we met last month at the fund-raising
event.” Say, “I’m so sorry, sometimes I can’t even remember my own name!”
In some situations you can feel comfortable using humor, but you do not
want to make a joke of the circumstances because in some cultures it’s con-
sidered an insult to forget someone’s name. It’s best to simply apologize and
move on.
If — horrors! — you forget someone’s name when you’re about to make an
introduction, don’t make a scene. It’s not the end of the world. Simply say,
“I’ve momentarily forgotten your name.” The person should jump in and say,
“It’s Rex Martin.” You can say, “Of course, Rex, I’d like to introduce Linda
Thornhill.” It’s a big deal only if you make it a big deal. Admit your mistake
and move on.
The ability to remember names and titles, especially in a large group, makes a
lasting impression. If you can master this new form of professional polish,
you will present yourself with confidence and authority — and outclass the
competition. Remembering names is a skill, and one that you can acquire:
1. Repeat the person’s name a few times to yourself after you’re 
introduced.
2. Use the person’s name immediately in the conversation after an 
introduction.
3. Immediately introduce that new person to someone else you know.
If you don’t have an opportunity to speak up immediately, you may want
to try finding a word association with the person’s name, such as “Bob —
B — Brown shoes.”
4. Jot down the person’s name, if you happen to have a pad and pencil.
5. Listen, listen, listen.
Good listening skills and concentration are the real keys to recalling a
name. If you heard the name but didn’t understand it, simply ask the
person to repeat the name. You also can ask for a business card; just 
be sure to read it as soon as you receive it (see “Exchanging business
cards,” later in this chapter).
77
Chapter 5: The Art of Meeting and Greeting

Correcting others’ introductions
If someone mispronounces your name or gets it completely wrong, just smile
and say something like this: “Thank you, but my name is actually Karen Miller,
not Morton.” Should you mispronounce someone’s name, simply apologize,
ask for the correct pronunciation, repeat the name aloud, and continue with
your introduction.
If you happen to have a name that’s easily mispronounced, you may jump in
and help the person making the introduction. Many people find it helpful to
find something your name rhymes with or something people can visualize
(“It’s Sue Fox, like the animal”).
Never walk up to someone and ask, “Remember me?” Doing so is cruel! Always
stop and reintroduce yourself politely. If you see someone you’ve met but
can’t remember the name, simply say something along the lines of this: “I
remember meeting you recently. Was it at corporate headquarters?” Usually,
the other person is flattered that you remember having met him or her, even
if you’ve forgotten the name. And if you’ve been introduced to someone pre-
viously, allow yourself to be reintroduced if you’re not recognized. Don’t
make this situation an issue.
Exchanging business cards
The biggest mistake you can make when you receive someone’s business
card is to glance at it and then slide it into a pocket. This treatment shows
little respect for the other person, regardless of their position and rank.
When you’re handed a business card, read it thoroughly. You may want to
repeat the person’s name for pronunciation and acknowledge the person’s
company as being well respected, or ask something about the company or
his position. Finally, express your gratitude for being given this information.
Handling the Handshake
Does a handshake really matter? Think back to the last time you got a limp
handshake or a bone-crusher. What impression did it make on you? Was it
distracting? Disgusting? Shocking? Whatever your reaction, you probably
weren’t feeling positive about the other person.
What a sloppy handshake says about the person behind the hand is that he
just doesn’t have things together. And if you’re the sloppy shaker, you’re telling
the client, boss, or interviewer that you have problems. That conclusion can
lead him to make a subconscious decision that he doesn’t want to do business
with you — or that you won’t make a good representative of his company.

The handshake is the physical greeting that accompanies a verbal greeting.
Because the handshake is used universally in business, knowing when to
shake hands and how to shake hands confidently is vital.
Not shaking hands is a very clear form of rejection and is extremely insulting
to the other person.
Using the perfect form
What is a proper handshake? The act seems so simple, yet people get con-
fused about how to do it.
In the United States, you’re expected to offer a firm handshake and make eye
contact at the same time. A firm handshake with good eye contact communi-
cates self-confidence. In U.S. etiquette, an appropriate handshake begins with
the introduction:
1. Extend your hand and grip the other person’s hand in such a way that
both are pushed all the way in to meet web-to-web and your thumbs
are facing straight up. (See Figure 5-1.)

and

Chapter 5: The Art of Meeting and Greeting

2. Shake just a couple of times in a vertical up-and-down motion.
The range of motion is 2 or 3 inches. The motion is extended from the
shoulder, through the elbow, and straight through to your hand.
3. End the handshake cleanly, before the introduction is over.
If you want to count, a good handshake is held for 3 or 4 seconds.
Handshaking is a form of nonverbal communication that says a lot about a
person. For example, an overpowering handshake can indicate dominance or
control. A weak handshake can indicate insecurity, disinterest, shyness, and
aloofness. An awkward handshake indicates nervousness or a lack of social
skills, which in turn reflects on credibility.
Understanding some rules of protocol
When someone makes an introduction, always remember to stand (if you’re
seated at the time) so that you can shake hands on an even level. That rule
goes for women as well. If you happen to be seated at a table where reaching
the other person is difficult or awkward, however, you don’t have to stand. In
this situation, mention how regretful you are that you cannot stand to meet
them properly. By doing this it shows your savvy of correct business 
etiquette.
If you’re wearing a name tag, place it on your right shoulder, because that’s
where a person’s eye naturally wanders when shaking hands.
Shaking hands can be awkward in some situations. Should you be introduced
to someone when your hands are full, carrying files or other packages, don’t
try to rearrange everything. Simply nod your head in a cordial greeting, state
how, unfortunately, you are unable to shake their hand, and respond to the
introduction.
When holding a cocktail at a stand-up reception, hold your drink in your left
hand. You don’t want to offer someone a wet or cold hand to shake. Except
for opera-length gloves, when wearing gloves as part of formal attire, always
remove them before shaking hands (the same goes for wearing sunglasses or
gloves outdoors — you should always take them off, unless the temperature
is bitterly cold or the sun is overly glaring).
Knowing when to shake hands
The answer is, all the time. When in doubt, offer your hand. Shaking hands is
appropriate when you’re
80
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

 Renewing an acquaintance
 Acknowledging someone who enters your office, cubicle, or home
 Greeting a client, new coworker, host, or others you know or are meeting
for the first time
 Meeting someone you already know outside work or home
 Concluding a transaction
 Leaving a business or social event
In fact, because you should shake hands more often than not, the real question
is, when don’t you shake hands? Mainly, you should avoid shaking hands when
the other person has his hands full, and putting everything down to shake your
hand would be a big inconvenience, or when the person is of a certain culture
or religion (see Chapter 22 for details). The final exception may be when the
person you want to greet is someone much higher ranked than you and with
whom you really have nothing in common. In this case, rushing up to shake 
his hand and introducing yourself may appear overly pushy.
81
Chapter 5: The Art of Meeting and Greeting
Avoiding the clammy-hand dilemma
If you tend to have cold hands, stick your right
hand in your pocket to warm it up as you
approach a situation in which you’ll have to
shake hands. And if you have perennially clammy
hands, try the high-school prom-date approach:
Quickly swipe your right hand on your skirt or
trousers so that when you present your hand, it’s
dry. You can do so quickly and gracefully, and no
one will be aware that you made the gesture. If
you are prone to sweaty palms, try rubbing a
sanitizer with alcohol or antiperspirant (non-
sticky and unscented!) on your hand before leav-
ing the house and meeting someone.

Chapter 6
Making Polite Conversation
In This Chapter
 Speaking and listening courteously
 Cruising through office communication
 Mingling effectively
 Avoiding common conversation mistakes
F
ew skills are more appreciated than the ability to make conversation.
The person who is able to draw people into conversations, introduce
interesting topics, and make everyone comfortable is valued in all situations,
business and social. Conversation is an art as well as a skill.
In this chapter, I introduce you to some techniques for improving your con-
versational skills. You discover that good speaking and listening skills require
practice. I also show you how to keep the channels of communication open in
the office, how to mingle at social gatherings, and how to avoid making some
common conversational mistakes.
Speaking Wisely and Listening Well
Those people who have been able to cultivate the skill of conversation have a
leg up on others who are stuck behind a computer or buried under a stack of
paper. To become an interesting conversationalist, first keep in mind these
three principles:
 Always try to put the other person at ease.
 Engage in a genuine exchange of information.
 Show that you care about what’s on the other person’s mind.

Good conversationalists also share these abilities:
 They know how to give and accept compliments gracefully.
 They can talk about many subjects and are able to maneuver through con-
versations pertaining to things they know little about without difficulty.
 They can quickly discern potential topics of interest to any given group
and steer the conversation in that direction.
 They don’t repeat gossip.
 They never correct another person’s vocabulary or grammar.
 They know when to discuss business and when not to.
 They involve everyone in the group in conversation, not just one person.
 They know how to step in to fill in an embarrassing void in conversation.
 They have a good sense of humor and are able to relate stories well.
 They can sense when other people are bored.
Keep in mind, though, that engaging in polite conversation involves a lot
more than just talking about appropriate topics; it also requires sharp listen-
ing skills and the use of tact, as you find out in the following sections.
Sparking a conversation
There’s no one way to spark a conversation. The best conversationalists know
that the topic depends on the group and the context of the situation. If you
happen to be shy or feel uneasy about chatting with coworkers or those
you’ve just met, you may need to work a little harder. In conversation, as with
other skills, practice makes perfect.
Good conversation starters involve everyone in your group in a lively discus-
sion. For example, introducing the topic of baseball and then going on and on
about statistics with one other person in the circle who is a fan is not a good
idea. If you’re in a group of people and you need to raise a conversation, try
one of the following topics:
 Nationally prominent sports (so everyone can participate): Examples
include the Super Bowl and the Olympics.
 Current events: Make sure to read a newspaper, a newsmagazine, or
Internet news on the day of the event. Appropriate current events
include business news, personal-interest stories, stories about nature,
and stories about local civic accomplishments.
 Positive items of interest to everyone in the company: Potential topics
include the new advertising campaign, company blogs, and the
redesigned corporate cafeteria, for example.
84
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

 Best-selling books, cultural events, or a recent film: Talking about the
latest film, play, musical performance, or art show interests almost
everyone.
 A compliment about the event, host, food, wine, or venue: Providing
positive comments always gets the conversation rolling on a 
pleasant note.
Try to include everyone in the group in the conversation by asking various
people questions and drawing out their opinions. Commenting on why you’re
attending the event, asking other people why they’re attending, or asking
others to tell you something about themselves are various ways to start a
conversation.
Asking a question is also a good way to break the ice. It all begins with a reso-
lution on your part to say something when you find yourself making eye con-
tact with another person. For example: “I’m currently working in the marketing
department on the Delta project. You’ve probably seen my name copied in
some of your e-mails — Jon Kenton. Aren’t you working on the budget for our
new Internet marketing campaign?”
The other party’s duty is to respond with a reasonable answer. A simple yes
or no turns off the whole conversation and leaves an awkward silence.
The power of question-and-answer dialogue will keep the conversational ball
rolling. Be prepared to listen to the answer and try not to be thinking ahead
about what you want to say.
To stay out of hot water conversationally, follow these guidelines:
 Avoid asking very personal questions (about someone’s impending
divorce or broken engagement, for example).
 Stay away from religion, politics, sex, and money. If you raise one of
these topics, even in a joking manner, you’re walking on thin ice, as 
you never know whether you’re offending other people’s sensibilities.
 Avoid using inappropriate language, such as slurs or curse words, and
never tell a joke that you think may be even slightly off-color. (If you
think the joke may be off-color, it probably is.)
 Recognize when you’ve been speaking with someone for more than 5 or
10 minutes. This elapsed period is your cue to move on to another con-
versation. People appreciate the conversationalist who stays away from
talking nitty-gritty business at a company event. No one wants to get
into a long-winded discussion of the outcome of your latest personal-
injury case as you detail everything your client did to make life difficult
for you. Save this conversation for Monday morning in the office.
85
Chapter 6: Making Polite Conversation

If you notice you’ve hit on an uncomfortable topic someone isn’t interested in,
as awkward as it may be, try to turn the conversation to another subject —
even simple small talk will do. Watch for physical communication signals as
well as verbal ones.
Listening politely
The wisest people seem to listen more than they speak. As a well-mannered
person, you want to emulate that behavior. (By doing so, you train yourself to
listen better, and other people will also listen very carefully to the words you
do speak.)
When you listen well, you remember all the conversation’s major points,
including any actions that are your responsibility. You can ask intelligent
questions at the end of the conversation, and you may even learn something!
If you find that you’ve been monopolizing the conversation, simply apologize
and throw the ball in the other person’s court without drawing too much
attention to your faux pas. You can easily do this by asking a question.
Listening well means more than just sitting quietly. Your body language also
shows that you’re attentive:
 Neither slump down in your chair nor sit rigidly without moving. Keep
both your feet flat on the floor, or cross your feet only at the ankles.
Don’t cross your legs at the knees, and don’t prop your feet up on chair
rungs. Keep your hands and arms relaxed, resting on the arms of the
chair, or sitting in your lap. Don’t fold your arms across your chest.
 Watch the speaker, and don’t let your eyes wander all over the room.
 Sit comfortably, without shifting every few minutes. Crossing and
uncrossing your legs or arms signals boredom. For more on body lan-
guage, see Chapter 4.
 Acknowledge and confirm that you’re listening by using periodic oral
sounds, such as “ah-hah,” “yes,” “I see,” and the like.
When receiving instructions from bosses or clients, repeat what you think
you hear them saying to clarify everyone’s understanding of the issues at
hand.
Using tact in any situation
A tactful person is also a diplomatic person, which means she gently conveys
difficult information so that it’s acceptable to the receiving party. Flatly issu-
ing commands and loudly mouthing opinions are great ways to show complete
86
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

ignorance of the use of tact. If a client or coworker is sharing a new idea or
strategy, be quiet and listen; then come up with a suitable response, such 
as, “That’s an interesting concept, can you give us the details?”
The untactful thing to do would be to blurt out your first thought about a dis-
agreeable idea or strategy (“Are you out of your mind?!?” or worse, “We’ve
tried that before and it didn’t work!”). This reaction may not achieve your
objective of steering the client from that horrifyingly bad idea. What may
work better? “That’s an interesting idea. Why don’t we take it back to the
team and review our research on consumer response? I’ll give you a call
tomorrow morning to let you know what we find.”
Ending a conversation gracefully
All things must come to an end (no matter how good or bad), and conversa-
tions are no exception. No rule says you have to remain trapped in a conver-
sation you’d rather end. A pleasant ending to a conversation can go a long
way, so take time and thought to end on a positive note. People remember
what they hear last the longest.
The ideal way to end a conversation is to smile, shake hands, thank the other
person for his time (though it isn’t always that simple), and close by saying
“It was nice talking to you.” How you extricate yourself is another measure of
your mastery of good manners. For example, a polite exit line can be: “I didn’t
know about all the fascinating projects you’ve been working on. Perhaps we
can meet for lunch soon so you can tell me more.”
You should never be dishonest when coming up with an exit line. Make 
sure your reason for ending the conversation is legitimate so you don’t 
risk making the person feel bad.
Handling Office Conversations
You can’t avoid communicating with others you work with. And whether
you’re small-talking with a coworker or meeting privately with your boss,
each mode of communication has its own set of etiquette guidelines.
Not only is clear communication one of the best ways to ensure that your
career advances, but it also ensures that your work environment is a pleasant
one and that everyone functions efficiently. Office conversations that take 
etiquette rules into account will help avoid unintentional errors that mis-
communication engenders. Read on to discover how to communicate politely
with your coworkers, make your point concisely with a group or an individ-
ual, and speak to your boss respectfully.
87
Chapter 6: Making Polite Conversation

Developing cubicle courtesy
The cubicle is a curious invention, giving the illusion of privacy without actu-
ally providing privacy. Although you can’t see your coworkers, you can cer-
tainly hear them. Engrain that fact in your mind. Loud telephone conversations
or group social chats centered on your cubicle can annoy people working
nearby. Although everyone expects and accepts the occasional social call,
receiving multiple calls (don’t fool yourself into thinking that your next-door
neighbor won’t be listening) and getting lots of visits from coworkers who
want to chat will annoy everyone around you. Keep chatting to a minimum,
or, if possible, make your personal calls away from your cubicle while you’re
on a break or at lunch, or make them while the people around you are in
meetings.
Chatting politely with coworkers
You’ll likely spend more time chatting with colleagues than with your boss
(although I give you some pointers for chatting with the boss in the next 
section). Here are some tips for talking to your coworkers:
 Be careful in the language you use with coworkers. Although slang
may be all right among your friends, your coworkers may have sensitivi-
ties you’re not aware of. Too much slang or use of foul language can turn
off coworkers.
 Keep in mind that you want to be friendly but you don’t want to
monopolize others’ time. Never bother someone by talking when 
that person is obviously trying to concentrate on making a deadline.
 Keep secrets. Any new information is your personal property, and you
shouldn’t share it with others.
 Keep personal discussions of your love life and your spouse to a mini-
mum. Close social friends can discuss almost anything, but people you
work with are not entitled to deeply personal details of your life. More-
over, there’s a chance that something you say may be repeated, or —
worse — turn into office gossip.
 Make sure that the tone of your conversations is positive. The person
who goes from cubicle to cubicle complaining and putting down other
people won’t go far.
 Don’t brag or boast to coworkers or other colleagues. It’s considered
rude to discuss details about achievements or things your boss said to
you privately, brag about your paid vacation, or succumb to conversa-
tion faux pas by dropping names.
88
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

 Always weigh your words carefully. Whether you’re chatting with a
coworker or participating in a meeting, always think before you speak.
Do your best not to repeat gossip, talk about other employees, or say
anything that could be offensive or confidential.
 Be gracious and considerate to others you work with. When a colleague
has had bad news, such as a sick child or a project that didn’t go well,
stopping by to show your concern is perfectly acceptable. By all means
express how sad you are and offer your assistance. If a colleague is feel-
ing discouraged, offering some words of encouragement is compassion-
ate. Even if you’re in the middle of making a tight deadline, take a few
minutes to help the other person. Someday, you may be the person
needing help.
In business, as in social situations, people appreciate someone who knows
how to make a conversation flow pleasantly. Take the initiative in starting
conversations, and always remember to be friendly, upbeat, and enthusiastic!
Getting some face time with the boss
Part of the reason you were hired is because your boss liked your personality
and thought you’d fit in and become a valuable addition to the team. Keeping
cordial relations with your boss is important, as is conveying that you enjoy
her company as a person as well as your superior, so stop by for some
friendly small talk.
Friendly chitchat is appropriate if your boss’s office door is open and if another
member of the team is already there having a chat. On the other hand, if your
boss’s door is closed, or if he’s working quietly in his office typing intently 
on the computer, he’s likely trying hard to get some serious work done and
won’t welcome a frivolous interruption. Likewise, if your boss is on the phone
or has a scowl on his face, you should probably wait for another time.
Respecting ethnic, cultural, 
and gender differences
Inadvertently insulting someone with a racial or ethnic slur is one of the
fastest ways to embarrass yourself and hurt others. As a well-mannered
person, you should have no problem avoiding this pitfall, because you’re
alert to your coworkers’ sensitivities and needs! As people from different
89
Chapter 6: Making Polite Conversation

ethnic, cultural, religious, and national origins unite, you need a tolerant 
and inclusive attitude, which means watching your language and your
actions. Here are some guidelines:
 Learn the currently accepted terms for the ethnic groups, religions,
and nationalities of those with whom you work. Get rid of all those
slang terms that you may have heard in the past.
 Don’t identify or refer to others by race or ethnic identity. People are
people.
 Use names and titles, and avoid other labels. Sexist terms are strictly
taboo. A person is a sales representative, not a salesman or saleslady.
An administrative assistant is not a secretary, and an information-
systems specialist is not a computer jockey.
 Be alert to a person’s special needs. If one of your colleagues must be
absent for a religious observance, offer to cover his responsibilities for
the day.
 Always make a conscious effort to speak inclusively. Don’t let sexist
terms creep into your vocabulary, and listen to the words that slip out of
your mouth.
See Chapter 3 for more information on respecting everyone’s differences in
the workplace.
Offering your opinion gently
Never interrupt or correct someone while she’s speaking. If you want to offer
a different opinion, don’t say, “Linda, you’re wrong. If you took time to read
the report, you’d understand.” It’s better to avoid a confrontation and harsh
words by not using the accusatory “you” and by gently providing another
point of view. You might say, “Linda’s point about our on-time delivery record
is interesting. I was reviewing last year’s customer-service survey yesterday,
and it pointed out a different reason why our delivery record may not be up
to par.”
Meetings are the place to show that you’re a team player. Use we when you’re
referring to work done by your team. Acknowledge your coworkers’ contribu-
tions by using we instead of I and our instead of my. Try to avoid saying things
like “I launched the new fund-raising campaign.” Instead, say, “Our team
worked together to launch the new fund-raising campaign.” See Chapter 10
for more information on meeting manners.

Branching Out and Getting Noticed 
with Effective Mingling
Nowhere is the art of mingling more important to your career than at a com-
pany party. You should be mixing with as many people as possible — not just
those in your department whom you know well. Believe it or not, mingling is
a vitally important business skill. Mingling well demonstrates that you’re a
friendly, open, and engaged person who is interested in other people. Mingling
poorly shows others that you’re either unsure of yourself or so egotistical
that you can’t listen to others.
Make the rounds at the party. Don’t spend all your time talking to one person;
you want to circulate. Many other people will be anxious about mingling and
will welcome your efforts to make conversation. The following tips show you
how to make the most out of an event and be a good representative for your
company:
 Be prepared. Know what you want to accomplish at the event — to meet
a number of people, find a particular resource, or get noticed.
 Remember to carry business cards and exchange them when appropriate.
 As you circulate, make sure you politely excuse yourself from the con-
versation. To say nothing as you exit is considered rude.
 Hold your drink in your left hand so that if you are introduced to some-
one, you don’t extend a cold, wet hand to shake.
 Be well-informed on current events and company news so you’ll have
small-talk options and various ways to start a conversation.
 Always avoid making negative comments. You don’t have to lie, but
never slander your employer or coworkers. Even if you think the com-
pany is mismanaged, keep it to yourself.
 Don’t overindulge at work events. Your behavior is a reflection of your
company, and staying sober can keep you from saying things you will
regret later.
 Introduce yourself and others properly. If possible, learn the names of
the attendees and the appropriate way of making an introduction before-
hand. If name tags are available, wear one on your right shoulder. For
more about meeting, greeting, and introducing people, see Chapter 5.
Make good eye contact, give solid handshakes, and try to speak to people
you haven’t met before. You never know what doors may open for you simply
because you made the effort to greet your colleagues in another department.
Follow the preceding guidelines and you’ll be set!
91
Chapter 6: Making Polite Conversation

Mingle! The definition of the word is “to socialize,” “come together,” and
“blend.” Don’t let fear stop you from approaching someone you’ve never 
met. With a bit of practice and planning before the event, you’ll soon be 
conversing with confidence.
While making small talk with a new group of people, the worst thing you can
do is keep glancing around for someone better to engage in conversation.
You can’t find a faster way to make someone feel unimportant. When you’re
speaking with someone, she should receive your full attention — no wander-
ing eyes!
Cocktail parties and other mingling events usually are noisy and punctuated
with interruptions. They’re not ideal venues for serious business conversa-
tions, so people will appreciate your keeping the conversation light. If you
see the potential for a fruitful business discussion, hand the other person
your business card, and say you will call her to make an appointment to con-
tinue the conversation.
Dealing with Common Conversational
Faux Pas
Many people are scared to death about conversing with others, particularly
groups of people, mostly out of fear of making mistakes. Never fear. Making
mistakes happens to everyone, and with a bit of practice and planning, you
can converse confidently.
If you’ve made a social faux pas, the worst thing you can do is slink off into a
corner and vow to move out of town, assume an alias, and never see that
group of people again as long as you live. Yes, that reaction is a normal human
reaction to embarrassment. You should fight it, however. You’re much better
off taking a deep breath, staying put, and facing the consequences with a
little humor. You’re much better off taking responsibility for your blunder
than blaming it on someone or something else. Keep that in mind as you read
about some common conversation mistakes in the following sections.
Saying something awkward
Relating your grandmother’s mysterious bladder problem to your client in
the hospital system’s marketing department may seem just fine to you, but 
it may well cause the vice president of marketing to feel squeamish. If your
conversation partner begins moving away from you for no apparent reason
or looks disturbed, you know that you’ve hit on an uncomfortable subject.
92
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

Religion, politics, how much things cost, salaries, gossip, and office secrets
are off-limits as conversation topics. Turn the conversation to current events,
food, positive news about colleagues, hobbies, industry talk, current trends,
or sports; all these topics make for good small talk. (See the earlier section
“Sparking a conversation” for more information.)
Cutting in on a conversation
Wanting to add your two cents to a conversation is only natural. If, however,
you feel the urge to cut in on someone else’s sentence with a fascinating tidbit
of information that you think makes you look witty and erudite, sit back and
wait a second. If a pause occurs, use it as your cue to talk. If a pause doesn’t
occur, or if the conversation changes course, be content with the thought
that although you may have missed a chance to contribute your wisdom about
the latest theory regarding the effect of debt on earnings per share, at least you
look composed and cool. Surveys show that the most annoying thing people
do when communicating is interrupting when others are speaking.
Talking too loudly
Speaking loudly in public, especially in restaurants, is common nowadays. It’s
not the loudest person who impresses his companions; it’s the person with
quiet confidence and good manners. Always try to use low, intimate tones.
If you’re speaking loudly in a restaurant because you’re talking on a cell phone,
shame on you. Cell phones should be turned off before entering a restaurant.
Even if you don’t mind interrupting a business dinner with a call, others in
the restaurant may appreciate having their meals in peace. See Chapter 7 for
more details on improving your phone manners.
Drawing a blank on what to say
If you come upon a pause in the conversation and have no idea what to say,
depending on the length of the pause, it may be just fine. Relax. There is no
need to feel you have to fill every second with conversation. Yet, the good
conversationalist can get the other person to talk about herself. You might
mention an article you read and ask the person’s opinion: “I’ve been reading
everything I can about the XYZ Company merger plans, but I still wonder
whether it makes sense. What do you think about their plans?” Or you may
ask about the person’s recent travels. If all else fails, you can always compli-
ment something about the event you are attending, whether it’s the food,
interesting guests, or a table setting.

Chapter 7
Improving Your Telephone
Manners
In This Chapter
 Speaking and listening politely on the phone
 Using telephone technology appropriately
 Conducting conference calls and videoconferences
You’re one of the new breed; you go everywhere outfitted with the latest
wireless technology. At your office, your phone system has more gizmos
than a starship: voice mail, call waiting, call forwarding, caller ID, speaker-
phones, and a headset. You are always in touch, whether you’re at a business
lunch, on your way to the dry cleaner, or in the backyard with your kids.
Funny thing — even with all your technologies at hand, you’re still not pleas-
ing everyone. People seem annoyed when you fiddle with your cell phone
during a meeting. Your kids groan every time your cell phone rings. Other dri-
vers send daggers your way when they see you chatting away in the car as
you weave your way in and out of six lanes of traffic at 70 miles an hour
(which in some states is illegal).
The problem isn’t the technologies; it’s the way they’re being used and abused.
One telling symptom of the need for new etiquette rules is the fact that news-
papers, magazines, the Internet, and business conversations are liberally
dosed with the latest funny story or outrageous thing someone has done with
the new technology. Think about the past few months: How many times has
someone told you about something hilarious someone else did with a cell
phone? How many articles and letters to the editor have you read describing
the outrage someone feels when a cell phone starts to ring at the worst time
or the impossibility of finding your way out of an automated answering
system?

Pretty clearly, a lot of us need some help with telephone etiquette. So this
chapter gives you the scoop on how to talk and listen on the phone, how to
use various phone technologies, how to use your phone with a minimum of
intrusion into others’ space, and how to conduct conference calls and video-
conferences with grace.
Speaking and Listening on the Phone
Some people just don’t know how to speak on the phone. You can hear every
breath they’re taking and the crunch-crunch of their afternoon corn chips, 
or they have the receiver so far away from their mouths that they sound like
they’re talking to you from the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. Some people also
don’t know how to listen on the phone. They respond “Uh-huh” to whatever
you say while you hear the clicking of their busy fingers on the keyboard in
the background, or they talk so much that you can’t get a word in edgewise.
These typical scenarios are common, but shouldn’t be this way! If you use the
information in the following sections, you’ll be a polite speaker and listener
on the phone in no time.
Practicing the basics
The basic facts of communication are these: One person is a speaker, and the
other is a listener. In most circumstances, the speaker’s job is to be as clear
as he can be and to speak in a polite, even tone. The listener’s job is . . . well,
to listen to what the speaker says and then respond appropriately.
Sounds simple, doesn’t it? But messing the process up is amazingly easy.
Usually, people just forget. As speakers, we mumble, shout, whisper, or speak
with food in our mouths. As listeners, we do other things when we’re sup-
posed to be listening, listen without hearing anything the other person says,
or respond to another person’s question from left field — with an entirely 
different topic.
Everyone gets overworked and distracted, and no doubt you have those
moments when someone calls you at exactly the wrong time. But it’s crucial
that you pay attention to what you say, how you say it, and how you listen
and respond to others on the phone. Studies have shown that the top rea-
sons why customers do not become repeat customers are employees’ indif-
ference and rudeness on the phone.

Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

So what can you do? Practice speaking and listening with someone you trust
by using these guidelines:
 Speak clearly, and pay attention to your conversational partner. Find
the correct distance from your mouth to hold the receiver so that your
voice doesn’t sound like part of the ambient background or like a hector-
ing protester speaking into a bullhorn.
 Practice listening, too. When you get a phone call, make a point of turn-
ing off other noisemaking equipment, including the radio. Turn away
from your computer if you have to so that you can avoid the temptation
to fiddle with the document on your screen. Excuse yourself from any
conversations you are currently having so as to give your telephone con-
versational partner your undivided attention.
Calling on the phone
So many people work in front of a computer screen all day that it’s easy to
forget the usual social graces — which include things they learned as chil-
dren, such as how to answer and place a call. Every time you make or receive
a telephone call at work, you’re representing your company. And, many
times, the first contact a person has with a company is over the phone, 
so the impression you make on the phone may be a lasting one. Therefore,
you want to sound professional. Now for some basic telephone manners:
 Prepare for the phone call before you make it. Have some idea of what
you’re going to talk about. Have a pen and paper handy.
 Make notes if necessary, especially if you’re forgetful. Planning is
better than having to make a second call.
When you call someone, introduce yourself the right way:
1. Say, “Hello.”
2. Identify yourself and your affiliation.
3. Ask for the person to whom you would like to speak.
Here’s an example:
“Hello. This is Tom Canon from Canon Technologies, calling for Ms
Hillander concerning next spring’s conference. Is she available?”
97
Chapter 7: Improving Your Telephone Manners

Always state the reason for your call. Don’t feel put off if you’re asked to state
the purpose of your business.
If Ms Hillander is available, you will be transferred to her. When she answers,
repeat your name and affiliation, state your business, and give an estimate of
the time you think the call will take, as in this example:
“Hello, Ms Hillander. This is Tom Canon from Canon Technologies, calling
about next spring’s conference in San Francisco. Do you have ten minutes
to talk about marketing strategy?”
That’s all you need. You’ve said who you are and what you want to talk about.
Now you pass the ball into the other person’s court and let her respond.
If the person you are calling is not available, whether you’re leaving a voice
mail or a message with a real person, give your name, your company’s name,
your telephone number, a time you can be reached, and a brief message.
Refrain from leaving a monologue to replace the conversation you would
have had. If you’re leaving a voice mail, repeat your phone number and 
speak slowly.
When your conversation is finished, end it cordially and quickly. A business
call is not a social call, so you don’t need to drag the conversation out
beyond the business at hand. If you know the other person well, however,
you may end the conversation with a few questions about something per-
sonal, such as “I was glad to hear your mother is back from the hospital” 
or “How did Sarah’s soccer game go?”
Keep the following guidelines in mind during a phone conversation:
 Answer as promptly as possible.
 Exercise patience on the phone, and let other people finish their 
sentences.
 Focus on listening.
 Speak so as not to be misunderstood.
 Listen to what the other person is saying.
 Don’t interrupt and speak over and while the other person is speaking.
 Confirm you’re listening with periodic oral sounds, such as “ah-hah,”
“yes,” and the like.
 Don’t chime in to interject you own comments and opinions.
 Be sure to speak directly into the mouthpiece, slowly and clearly.
Articulate properly, for example, “yes” instead of “yeah.”
98
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

 Your posture when you speak on the phone strongly affects how you
sound to the person on the other end and the energy that comes across
on the telephone. Don’t slump in your chair; sit up straight. Also, smiling
while you speak can actually make the tone of your voice more pleasant.
 If you dial an incorrect number, apologize before you hang up. This is
also considerate if you get someone’s voice mail.
Be helpful! If a caller has reached the wrong person, assist him in getting to
the right party. If you can’t find the person, or they have no voice mail, offer
to take and deliver a message.
Watch out for these mistakes:
 Never sneeze, belch, blow your nose, snort, or cough into a phone. Of
course this can be unavoidable, so always turn your head away from 
the phone and offer an apology.
 Never use phone calls as an opportunity to get caught up with paper-
shuffling.
 Never eat, drink, or chew gum while you’re on the phone.
 Never answer the phone abruptly by simply saying “yes.” Never use
slang terms or words that are inappropriate in business, such as
“honey,” “dear,” and “sweetheart.”
Answering the phone
The majority of phones today seem to be answered by voice mail. Getting an
actual voice on the other end of the line is a pleasant surprise! Companies
have lots of protocols for answering the phones. Most companies use an
automated voice-mail system with a variety of menus. If well constructed,
these answering systems can be helpful and efficient. If poorly constructed,
they can be a confusing and frustrating experience.
The first contact a potential client or customer typically has with your com-
pany is when someone answers your company’s phone. Make sure that it’s
answered well. When you answer the phone, speak clearly, identify your 
company, and ask the caller how you may direct the call or how you may
help. Answer any questions, if you can. If you can’t, direct the call to the
appropriate person.
Many greetings are acceptable, but they all contain the following information:
your company name and your name. Here’s a greeting that gets it right:
“Good morning. Holistic Health, Inc. James Moody speaking.”
99
Chapter 7: Improving Your Telephone Manners

This greeting is simple, succinct, and informative. If you say it with the right
inflection in your voice — that is, upbeat and engaged — you set the right
tone for the rest of the conversation immediately.
When you pick up the phone, remember to
 Stop whatever else you are doing.
 Speak clearly into the receiver.
 Be upbeat. Try smiling while you’re speaking; it works!
Putting a caller on hold is frustrating to the caller, so refrain from doing it
unless you absolutely have to. If you have to, remember that the process is
easier on the caller if you say “Will you please hold for a moment? I’ll go get
that information” than if you command the caller to “Hold!” and push the
button. Try your hardest to remember that people are on hold when you put
them there. Update the caller every half-minute or so on the progress you’re
making in putting his call through.
If you need to connect a caller to someone else, tell him the name of the
person you are directing the call to, and provide that person’s extension
number. If the call then gets disconnected, the caller will appreciate having
the name and the extension when he returns the call.
Screening calls for other people is a delicate matter. Not only may the caller
feel slighted when an administrative assistant tells him that Mr. Bigshot is not
available, but also, he may resent telling an administrative assistant about
the call and having the assistant determine its importance. Tact is necessary.
Good bosses provide their receptionists and administrative assistants the
protocols they want to use for screening and the language to be used with
callers. If your boss doesn’t set the criteria for screening or the language to
be used, ask him to do so.
Making the Most of Telephone
Technology
Cell phones, speakerphones, voice mail, answering machines, caller ID, and
call waiting — these communications technologies are much more prevalent
now than they once were, and they are undeniably helpful. Still, they have to
be used with care, lest you use them as an opportunity to exercise your frus-
trations or inadvertently make your caller annoyed . . . or (worse) mad.
100
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

Cell phones
Cell phones have a place in today’s business world. But that place is when you
are alone — such as while you’re walking or riding in a cab. If you’re using
your cell phone anywhere in public, such as on a train or in a mall, find a
secluded corner to converse away from others. Respect other people’s right
not to hear your conversation.
Public phones have been around for a long time, usually in phone booths that
protect the callers from noise and passersby from the details of the calls. Keep
the same principle in mind when using your cell phone. Try to construct a vir-
tual phone booth around yourself for the duration of the conversation.
That trick isn’t always possible, however, and when it isn’t, you should be
exceedingly sparing in your cell-phone use. Cell phones have no place in
restaurants; at the theater, movies, or symphony; in churches or classrooms;
or in meetings. You are in these places to do something other than talk on the
phone. Whenever you go into one of these settings, have the courtesy to turn
your wireless phone off.
The more available you make yourself, the more available everyone expects
you to be. People will begin to get upset if you are not instantly and con-
stantly available! Ask yourself, do you really want to be connected 24/7/365,
and is it absolutely necessary?
Think before you speak! A number of recent studies have concluded that
motorists who use cell phones while driving are four times as likely to get
into accidents. Most everyone agrees that handheld cell phones while driving
can constitute a hazardous distraction. Also, the theory that hands-free sets
are any safer has been challenged by the findings of a number of studies.
Researchers at the University of Utah, published in the summer 2006 issue of
Human Factors, the quarterly journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics
Society, conclude that talking on a cell phone while driving is as dangerous as
driving drunk, even if the phone is a hands-free model.
If you inadvertently forgot to turn the phone off and it starts to ring, hasten
to quiet it, even if that means turning it off without answering it, and apolo-
gize to those around you, as appropriate and convenient. Sometimes just
silencing your phone is all that is necessary.
Never answer a cell phone or begin a cell-phone conversation while you’re in
a bathroom. The potential for embarrassment is high.
101
Chapter 7: Improving Your Telephone Manners

Now that you know when it’s appropriate to have a cell-phone conversation,
you should be aware that some cell phones create problems during 
conversations:
 Cell phones have a habit of clipping off the beginnings of words and sen-
tences. When you’re talking to someone on a cell phone, the give and
take of the conversation can lead you into a black hole of clipped
queries.
To get out of the black hole, I recommend that you treat cell-phone 
conversations with the same courtesy you use for landline phone 
conversations — plus some. Remind yourself never to talk over your
telephone partner’s voice and to wait patiently to speak until he has 
finished talking.
 Another quirk of wireless phones is their occasional tendency to drop
calls. You can’t do much to avoid embarrassment and frustration when
you realize that the last two minutes of the review of the Steven Spielberg
flick you’ve been dictating to your editor drifted off into cyberspace.
Take a deep breath, and try again.
Speakerphones
Speakerphones are appropriate to use when you want to have a group meet-
ing with someone on the phone, but rarely otherwise. If you put people on
speakerphone, by all means tell them that you are doing it, and tell them who
else is in the room. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that the person on the
other end of the phone can’t tell when you put them on the speakerphone.
The additional echo of a speakerphone is instantly identifiable.
Suppose your caller is conferencing with three people in your office. First,
introduce your colleagues to the caller. Second, when talking, be especially
careful to identify yourselves to the caller at the beginning of your input to
the meeting. Having no visual means to connect voices to people, the caller
may be at a complete loss about who is talking without repeated identifica-
tion. (I give more details on conducting conference calls later in this chapter.)
Speakerphones are loud. If you’re using one, close the door to your office.
Voice mail and answering machines
Voice-mail systems allow people to leave a message for you when you are
away from your office or on another line.
102
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

When you record a greeting for your voice-mail system, remember that you
are at work and not at home. Messages such as “Hello, I’m Johnny Cash, and
I’m not here” aren’t helpful, and messages such as “I’m chillin’ — leave me
your 411!” will be indecipherable to most business callers. It’s preferable to
say something like the following:
“This is Georgette Johnson in the billing department at MacIntosh
Marketing. Please leave me a message, and I’ll return your call as 
soon as possible. Thank you.”
Some people record messages on a daily basis or direct callers to others in
the office who may be able to assist the caller. Most people change their mes-
sage when they are out of town on vacation or away on business for more
than a day. It is appropriate to record a message informing the caller when
you will be out of the office and saying that you will return the call when you
get back. You may also leave the name and number of someone else in the
office who can help the caller if he cannot wait until you return.
When you leave a message on someone else’s voice-mail system, the first
thing to do — before leaving the message — is give your name, your com-
pany affiliation, your telephone number, and the date and time of your call.
The next thing to do is leave a short message that is direct and to the point.
Message machines are no substitute for talking one on one, so don’t think
that the person listening to your message needs to hear all the gory details.
At the end of the message, repeat your name and your phone number, slowly.
When you get a message on your own voice-mail system, remember to return
the call the same day, if possible, or the next morning.
All of what I’ve said about voice mail applies to answering machines as well.
But one little issue concerning answering machines requires separate treat-
ment: Never admit to using your answering machine as a screening device. If
you want to take the call, pick up and say something like this: “Hi. Sorry; I
was in the other room.” This technique keeps your paranoid callers from feel-
ing screened (“Well, I made it through this time, but what about next time?”).
Caller ID
Caller ID has legitimate uses, and it’s becoming more and more popular. At
times, knowing who is on the other end of the phone is a tremendous 
advantage. The four or five extra seconds you have to concoct your latest
explanation about why you haven’t completed the new company marketing
strategy can, on occasion, save your hide.
103
Chapter 7: Improving Your Telephone Manners

You should avoid a couple of behaviors with caller ID:
 Just because you were “suddenly” out of the office when Mr. Drummond
called doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t return the message he leaves on
your voice-mail system. Having elected not to answer the phone doesn’t
relieve you of your obligation to return the call.
 It’s better to avoid saying “Hello, Jim” when you recognize the number.
This sort of greeting is a little unnerving to the caller, who may wonder
whether you have ESP.
Call waiting
Fortunately, call waiting is losing out in popularity to voice-mail systems,
especially in business. Soon, it could be gone completely.
If you find yourself using a phone equipped with call waiting, the best thing
to do is ignore the clicks. Remember that your current conversation takes
precedence unless special circumstances apply. If you absolutely need to
answer the second call, you should alert the caller you’re speaking with as
soon as you answer. Let him know that you may have to take another call
that you’re expecting. If the call is short, you can ask him to hold; if you
expect the call to be longer than a minute or two, apologize and ask him if
you can call him back.
Conducting Conference Calls and
Videoconferences with Care
Conference calls are increasingly popular, largely because the technology has
improved so much in the past ten years. In the not-too-distant future, real-
time videoconferencing will be affordable for most businesses via computers;
it is a reality now for many businesses.
Perhaps surprisingly, videoconferences are helping reintroduce people to
meeting manners. The explanation is straightforward: The camera has the
unfortunate ability to focus on one person at a time. Any flaws in a person’s
body language — slouching in the chair, for example — become glaringly
obvious on camera. Being part of a videoconference is a little like seeing
yourself on video for the first time: All those tics and quirks that you thought
you’d mastered years ago suddenly slap you in the face!
Conference calls and video (or Web) conferences are wonderful tools when
used properly. A few moments of real conversation over the phone or
through video can be worth a thousand e-mailed words. As with all meetings,
104
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

however, these electronic get-togethers require attention to etiquette. (Flip to
Chapter 10 for general information on in-person meetings.)
Conference calls
Some conference calls, usually for smaller groups, consist of several people
calling in to one participant’s office. The central person conferences every-
one together by pressing the conference button for each addition. Other
types of calls are monitored, meaning that all participants call a central
number and are placed in the conference by speaking to an operator or by
entering a password.
You should always identify yourself when you join a call, but do so with cau-
tion. On a monitored call, you may not be able to hear other speakers for a
few seconds, so don’t announce yourself immediately; if you do, you may
step on another speaker. If you join the call late, other callers usually hear 
a beep of some kind. Don’t announce yourself immediately. When a break 
in the action occurs, the host will probably say something like “Who just
joined the call?” Then you can announce your name and apologize profusely
for your tardiness.
Don’t ever sit in complete silence on a call without announcing yourself. The
other callers deserve to know everyone who is listening to them. Not announc-
ing your presence is akin to hiding behind the curtains in the boardroom.
Try to identify yourself each time you speak during a conference call. That
way, you can compensate for the lack of visual clues. And remember to be
especially considerate about other people’s contributions to the conference.
Give each person enough time to finish what he is saying before you reply.
Most teleconferencing systems today have mute features. However, if the
conference call is open to everyone, remember that every additional person
on a phone call adds an extra layer of background noise. When you’re on a
conference call, put your phone on mute unless you’re actually speaking.
Don’t forget to take yourself off mute when you have something to say. This
rule is amazingly hard to remember.
Videoconferencing
Given the growing trends of outsourcing and teams working together as well
as the increasing cost of air travel, the need for conferences between groups
of people at opposite ends of the country — or the world, for that matter —
has never been greater.
105
Chapter 7: Improving Your Telephone Manners

Many companies today are using affordable Web and videoconferencing soft-
ware for Internet meetings. Some companies still use old-style videoconfer-
encing, though more of it is being done on the Internet and then projected
onto a large screen.
The following Web sites offer products that make Web or videoconferencing
simple to use:
 www.ivci.com
 www.megameeting.com
When you are scheduled for a videoconference, begin your preparation for it
well in advance. Train those who are unfamiliar with the format by staging
mock meetings and videotaping them. Show everyone the tapes, and make
suggestions if necessary. Have an agreed-upon agenda for the meeting in
place, if you can. Make sure that everyone whose input is required during 
the videoconference can make it at the scheduled time.
During the actual meeting, take care to sit properly, listen attentively, speak
clearly, and be patient. Be aware that some long-distance audio can introduce
slight delays in the conversation (although the technology has improved
greatly), and compensate for those delays.
Some people appear to think that because they aren’t in the same physical
space as their videoconferencing colleagues, they’re free to do things that
they would never dream of doing were they in the same room. But this opin-
ion is an error in judgment. Your videoconferencing setup may not allow you
to view everyone, but that doesn’t mean they can’t see all the people on your
end, and it doesn’t mean that a camera won’t find you just as you’re counting
holes in the ceiling tiles. It’s best to always be aware of your body language
and facial expressions during a videoconference.

W
ith all the spell-check, grammar-check, and letter-writing programs on
computers, you may think you no longer need to know how to write
well. Think again. Writing is still an essential skill for the professional, as you
may have discovered the day your boss returned one of your letters sprin-
kled with her red editing marks.
Think about how many letters, e-mails, memoranda, and reports you get every
week. Even if you’re not a grammar expert, you can tell that some of them are
more effective than others. Some are so disorganized that you can’t find the
point. Others are so brusque as to be a little offensive. With still others, you
look in vain for a paragraph that doesn’t have a misspelled word. By contrast,
an effective letter or report is grammatically correct and contains no spelling
errors; its tone is appropriate to its content; it’s direct without being curt; and
it gets to the point quickly and stays there.
In this chapter, I show you how to compose various types of business corre-
spondence. You also find out how to avoid some basic grammatical, stylistic,
and spelling errors; how to write in a consistent and well-organized manner;
what to have in your stationery drawer; and how to address business
envelopes. By the end of the chapter, you’ll no longer be intimidated by 
business writing. You may even have enough knowledge to become the 
office expert!

Communicating with Clarity 
and Courtesy
Perhaps you don’t have a strong background in grammar. Maybe you avoided
every university class that had a heavy writing component. You’re the best
technician in your division, but now you’re expected to write memoranda
and letters to all kinds of people, and you don’t have an administrative assis-
tant. Result? Your trash can is full of rejected drafts, and your temperature
rises to the boiling point every time you have to write a memo.
For all but the luckiest of us, clear writing is a skill that must be learned. Sure,
naturally great writers exist, but for the rest of us, practice — and lots of it —
is required. The trouble is that you don’t have time to practice. So you do it
on the fly, with each piece of correspondence that you write.
I have two suggestions for you. The first is to read this section carefully. The
second is to buy a dictionary, a thesaurus, and a copy of Strunk and White’s
The Elements of Style. This little book (fewer than 100 pages) is recognized as
the best primer on writing ever composed. Other good writing books are
available (and plenty of business-writing books too), but Strunk and White
provide more about writing in less space than in any other book.
With that said, it’s time for your crash course on clear and courteous busi-
ness writing. I assume that you learned elementary grammar and know the
difference between a noun and a verb, a subject and a predicate, a proper
noun and a common noun. If you don’t, consult your Strunk and White.
Writing well
Clear business writing requires a good grasp of grammar and spelling, a good
vocabulary, the desire to not be misunderstood, and ruthless self-editing.
Business writing also requires a touch of grace.
Brushing up on the basics
You’re probably starting with a good grasp of basic grammar and spelling. You
acquire a good vocabulary in only one way: by reading. To paraphrase, 
“You are what you read.” Business executives around the world recommend
that you read a lot of difficult material in diverse fields. This recommendation
is twofold: You learn new perspectives and information; and you learn new
words. Both types of learning help your writing. The intention is to be as
clear as you can be and to avoid all avoidable ambiguity. Writing requires 
an attention to detail that is not needed in conversation.
108
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

Editing is perhaps the most difficult thing to do with your own writing. After
all, you wrote it, so you don’t want to change it. But you should, because
even trained writers can always find changes to make.
Edit, edit, edit — at least three times. Before anyone else gets the chance to
hack away at your work, be your own worst critic. Eliminate the grammatical
mistakes, spelling errors, and poor style. Read the letter out loud. Can that
sentence be clearer? Make it so. Reread the letter out loud. Perhaps that
word is too aggressive. Change it. Reread the letter. This paragraph isn’t as
clear as it should be. Rework it. Reread the letter. It looks good? Give it to
someone else, and have her read it. When she can find no fault, reread it once
more. Then print it, sign it, and send it!
Adding grace
Business writing, like all professional writing, is bound by the code that per-
formance — not the person — is the subject of criticism. Focus on the topic
at hand, rather than on the person who is talking about it, even if the person
is a rude so-and-so. Here are the mistakes to avoid:
 Never swear in business correspondence.
 Never call people names in business correspondence.
 Never make off-color remarks in business correspondence.
Courteous writing requires that your tone be moderate. Tone is a function of
word choice and sentence style. Choosing your words carefully demands a
vocabulary rich enough to have words to choose from.
Speak softly, whether in person or in writing, even to your enemies. Your
lawyers are carrying the big sticks.
Avoiding writing errors
Writing clearly requires that you eliminate the mistakes that threaten clarity.
The first mistake is thinking that writing is no more than transcribed speech.
It isn’t. When you’re talking in person or on the telephone, you can rely on
the context of conversation to fill in gaps and to compensate for being
ungrammatical. That context is absent in writing, so a good writer makes
sure that her writing is clear, grammatically correct, and to the point.
When you acknowledge that writing is different from talking, the next impor-
tant task is to eliminate the errors to which every writer is prone, which I 
discuss in the following sections.
109
Chapter 8: Sharpening Your Written Communication Skills

Spelling errors
Believe it or not, spelling errors can doom business relations. You may find it
hard to believe, but clients notice when your letters aren’t proofread.
Many spelling errors are easily remedied by running your document through
your computer’s spell-check program. But beware — spell-checkers don’t
catch all the errors that can creep into a document. A trained eye is still
better than a spell-check program. Remember to always double-check the
spelling of the person’s name to whom you are writing.
Grammatical errors
Most people are bored to tears by grammar, and for good reason: It’s boring
to most people! Grammar is a necessary skill for composing effective busi-
ness letters, e-mails, and memoranda, however. Repeatedly making gram-
matical errors instantly brands you as being poorly educated and careless.
Bad grammar leaves a bad impression.
So you slept through your grade-school grammar classes; your major in col-
lege required that you take only multiple-choice exams; and in graduate
school, everyone was wowed by your fabulous technical expertise. Now you
sweat bullets every time you have to compose a letter. Not to worry! The fol-
lowing sections note some of the most common grammatical errors and how
to correct them.
Subject/verb agreement
If the subject of the sentence is singular, so is the verb; if the subject is plural,
so is the verb. This rule applies even if other words intervene between the
subject and the verb.
Mistake: The job description — a full-time shipper in a variety of small-
business settings — are not detailed enough.
Better: The job description — a full-time shipper in a variety of small-business
settings — is not detailed enough.
The subject is the job description, not the business settings.
Subjects such as everyone, everybody, neither, nobody, and someone should
be treated as singular.
Mistake: Everyone has their own idea.
Better: Everyone has his or her own idea. Everyone has an idea. We all have
our own ideas.
110
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

Sentence fragments
A sentence is a complete thought that must have a subject and a predicate
phrase, including a verb. Sentences that lack subjects or predicates are 
sentence fragments.
Mistake: We are unwilling to take action. While we acknowledge your concerns.
Better: We are unwilling to take action, even though we acknowledge your
concerns.
Run-on sentences
Run-on sentences include too much for a single sentence. Breaking one long
sentence into several shorter sentences is a quick and easy fix.
Mistake: Mr. Weaver informed us that his Tonka truck was irreparable but
that he didn’t want to trade it for a similar toy, instead he wanted to get a
cash refund so that he could buy his son a different toy which we disagreed
with and so refused his suggestion.
Better: Mr. Weaver informed us that his Tonka truck was irreparable. However,
he didn’t want to trade it for a similar toy, preferring to get a cash refund so
that he could buy his son a different toy. We disagreed with Mr. Weaver and
refused to comply with his demand.
Dangling modifiers
Modifiers are sentence clauses that modify or affect the subject of the sen-
tence. Modifiers dangle when what they modify is unclear. The results are
often quite funny. The following was written by a man describing an ad 
campaign being considered by his company:
Mistake: Numerous times, I sat in my living room and watched June Cleaver
vacuum and dust while wearing a dress, high heels, and pearls.
The clause “while wearing a dress, high heels, and pearls” is meant to modify
“June Cleaver.” However, it actually modifies the author!
Better: Numerous times, I sat in my living room and watched June Cleaver
vacuum and dust while she wore a dress, high heels, and pearls.
Punctuation errors
Punctuation errors are among the most common writing errors. They make
your correspondence look unprofessional. Here, then, is a brief refresher
course on punctuation.
111
Chapter 8: Sharpening Your Written Communication Skills

Commas
The comma marks a pause, sets off parenthetical material, separates main
clauses in a compound sentence, or follows introductory expressions.
Mistake: If you’re going to buy a camera you should get a flash.
Better: If you are going to buy a camera, you should get a flash.

The period ends a sentence.
Mistake: Please consider our proposal, we think you will agree that our 
service has overwhelming advantages.
Better: Please consider our proposal. We think you will agree that our service
has overwhelming advantages.
Semicolons
The semicolon marks the end of a thought to which the next thought is inti-
mately linked, or punctuates lists that are longer than three items.
Mistake: When using our product, care is required, without proper care, all
warranties are null and void.
Better: When using our product, care is required; without proper care, all
warranties are null and void.
Colons
The colon marks the break between a sentence and a list that follows. The
colon is not used in lieu of a period, a comma, or a semicolon.
Dashes
The dash takes the place of a comma (when offsetting a parenthetical remark),
period (when the succeeding sentence has the same subject), or colon (when
the material following the dash expands on something before the dash). The
dash is more informal than any of the punctuation marks it replaces. When
used sparingly, it can be an effective tool.
Mistake: Tom who never said a mean thing about anyone admitted to think-
ing that Terry was vicious.
Better: Tom — who never said a mean thing about anyone — admitted to
thinking that Terry was vicious.

Disorganization
Because words are organized into sentences, sentences into paragraphs, and
paragraphs into the finished product, start with your sentences. Make sure
that they are grammatically correct and that they say what you want them to
say — and don’t say anything that you don’t want them to say.
Paragraphs composed of nothing but grammatically correct sentences are a
good start. But your paragraphs also need to be organized. Typically, the
most important sentence is the topic sentence, in which you identify what
will be discussed in that paragraph. The balance of the paragraph is devoted
to articulating, defending, explaining, or describing what you announce in
your topic sentence.
Mistake: There is a golf course nearby and the pumps were plugged in at the
time of the house inspection. Mr. Olson informs me that he did not mislead
you about the need for sump pumps on the property. We are not really sure
what this litigation is about. Mr. Olson put the pumps in after spring rains one
year and did not conceal this fact during the inspection.
Better: We are not sure what this litigation concerns. First, Mr. Olson did not
mislead you about the need for sump pumps on the property. Mr. Olson put
the pumps in and disclosed this at the time of the house inspection. Moreover,
they were running at the time of the inspection. Furthermore, the golf course
is clearly visible from the property.
The first paragraph meanders through events that are not obviously con-
nected. The second paragraph starts with a topic sentence that tells you
exactly what the issue is. The other sentences defend the claim made in 
the topic sentence.
Passive voice
Passive voice is easy to diagnose: When the subject of the sentence is no
longer the actor who does things, you have passive voice. Look at the 
difference between these two sentences, which “say” the same thing:
Mistake: We were told by the director that our scene would not be shot
because we were likely to be hit with rain before the afternoon was through.
Better: The director told us that the forecast for rain would probably scuttle
our shoot.
The first sentence is in passive voice; the second is in active voice. The first
sentence implies that no one is responsible, because things just happen.

Chapter 8: Sharpening Your Written Communication Skills

Excess verbiage
Bad writers use more words than are needed. Good writers don’t; they know
what words will convey their message efficiently. You improve your writing
immediately by eliminating verbiage. Verbiage is like a jungle: Too much lush-
ness means you can’t see the sky.
Mistake: Due to the fact that any and all persons who had relations in con-
nection with the reorganization of the hospital have experienced the move
that human resources has had to make to the west wing owing to their down-
sizing, it is perhaps to be expected that some procedures have suffered.
Better: Human resources’ move to the west wing has caused some proce-
dural problems.
Chop! Chop! Chop! Out of the suffocating verbal vines emerges one clear 
sentence.
Surveying Corporate and 
Executive Stationery
Every corporate and executive office has a variety of stationery in its drawers.
Each type has its function. But all types should share some characteristics:
 First, the paper should be of high quality. Paper for business letters
should contain some rag-cotton content — typically, about 25 percent.
When you’re at the paper store, you can determine the rag content by
looking at the box the paper comes in. You also want paper that is water-
marked. You can determine whether paper has a watermark by holding 
a piece of it up to the light; you will be able to see the watermark
embossed on the paper.
 Second, the stationery should be uniform in color, weight, and letterhead
across sizes. Your company needs an identity, and one way to establish
identity is through stationery. Having one font for your letterhead and
another for your monarch sheets makes your corporate identity look
uncertain.
Here are a few more guidelines:
 Don’t skimp! Stationery is an essential part of your corporate identity.
 Quality usually trumps gimmicky color, shape, and design.
The following sections explain what goes in the stationery drawer.
114
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

Corporate letterhead
Letterhead should be 81⁄2 x 11 inches, with high rag content and with the fol-
lowing relevant information printed on it:
 Business name
 Business address
 Business telephone number
 Business fax number
 Business e-mail address or Web page, if appropriate
Businesses that are partnerships, such as law firms and group medical prac-
tices, typically list all the partners or members on the letterhead.
Envelopes are printed with the company name and address.
Plain sheets of paper
Plain sheets should be 81⁄2 x 11 inches and of the same quality as corporate
letterhead. This paper is for letters longer than one page. (Second and sub-
sequent pages are not presented on letterhead.)
Monarch paper
This type of paper should be 71⁄4 x 101⁄2 inches, with high rag content. The sheets
are used for personal business letters and have the following information
printed on them:
 Person’s name, but not the company’s name
 Business address
If monarch sheets are used as corporate letterhead (as consultants, physi-
cians, and attorneys sometimes do), include the business name.
Envelopes are printed with the person’s name and business address.
115
Chapter 8: Sharpening Your Written Communication Skills

Correspondence cards
These small (typically, 41⁄2-x-61⁄2-inch), nonfoldable cards are used for personal
messages, announcements, and thank-you notes. They have the following
information only:
 Person’s name, not business name
 Business address
Envelopes are printed with the person’s name and business address.
You may also use a fold-over card of the same size. These cards are some-
times called informal and may have a logo on the front.
Business cards
Business cards generally are 31⁄2 x 2 inches, although other sizes are increas-
ingly used in certain businesses. You present the business card to other people
at business functions. The card should contain the following information:
 Person’s name and title
 Business name
 Business address
 Business telephone number
 Business e-mail address
 Business fax number
 Business Web-page address
Your company logo may be incorporated into the design of the business 
card. You may also include a brief description or motto of your business.
Although some people prefer to leave the back of the card blank, you may
print additional information about your company on the reverse side.
Writing Common Types of 
Business Correspondence
A letter is still the single most important form of communication in business.
It is less ambiguous than a meeting simply because no one has to rely on
memory to know what occurred; there, in black and white, is what you said.
116
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

For that reason, important business decisions are formalized in letters. In the
following sections, I explain how to write a proper business letter and another
common kind of correspondence: the memorandum.
Business letters
Most business letters are written with the intention of getting the reader to
respond in some way. Given that goal, your writing should be efficient, clear,
error-free, friendly, and pertinent.
When composing business letters, keep the following pointers in mind:
 Use high-quality paper with at least 25 percent cotton rag content. (I
describe different types of business stationery earlier in this chapter.)
 Never send a letter written in anger unless you’ve waited 24 hours to
review it.
 Plan your correspondence before writing it. Know what you want to say
and in what order you want to say it.
 Compose your correspondence after planning it. Use direct, active lan-
guage; vary your sentence structure; adopt a moderate, friendly tone;
and give clear directions.
 Revise the letter to include any new information.
 Edit the letter for spelling, grammar, style, tone, and content.
 Edit again.
Each time you reread the letter, it is recommended that you focus on one
aspect. Do not attempt to look for more than one or two elements when you
reread letters. Instead, reread letters several times, focusing first only on
grammar, then on spelling and missing or incorrect words (that a spell-
checker won’t catch), and finally on tone, content, and style.
The form of a business letter is standardized. All business letters have the 
following elements:
 Dateline: Three to six lines beneath the letterhead, flush left or right.
The dateline contains the month (fully spelled out), day, and year.
 Reference line: One or two lines below the dateline, flush left, and
repeated on each additional page. The reference line contains case or
file numbers or policy numbers.
 Recipient address: Three to six lines below the dateline, flush left. The
recipient address is composed of:
• Addressee’s courtesy title and full name: Courtesy titles in busi-
ness are Mr., Ms, and Dr. Spell names out completely.
117
Chapter 8: Sharpening Your Written Communication Skills

• Addressee’s business title: The title appears on the line below the
name.
• Business name: This text appears on the line below the business
title. Spell it exactly as it appears on the company’s letterhead. 
If the letterhead abbreviates Company as Co., you do too.
• Street address: This address appears on the line below the busi-
ness name. Spelling numbers out isn’t necessary unless confusion
would result otherwise; using “1745 26th Street” is just fine.
• City, State, Zip: When typing the state name on letterhead, the
entire word is to be spelled out, such as California or Pennsylvania.
It is not technically correct to use the U.S. Postal Service two-letter
code — for example, CA or PA — on the letterhead. It is properly
used on the envelope to expedite the processing of your letter for
mailing.
 Greeting or salutation: One or two lines below the last line of the recipi-
ent’s address. Usually, the salutation is “Dear Ms (Mr., Dr.),” followed by a
colon. If you use first names in person, you may do so in your salutation.
 Body: Starts one line below the greeting. The body of the letter contains
whatever you have to say. Be polite and courteous, but don’t be a wind-
bag. (Pay attention to the tips I provide earlier in this chapter.)
 Complimentary close and signature: Two lines below the last line of the
body of the letter, flush left or centered. All the following closes are
appropriate in business letters when you don’t know the addressee:
Yours truly, Very truly yours, Yours very truly, Sincerely, Yours sincerely,
Sincerely yours.
If you know the addressee by her first name, you can use any of the fol-
lowing: All the best, Best wishes, All best wishes, Regards, Best regards,
Kindest regards
Immediately below your complimentary close, you hand-write your sig-
nature. Use your full name if you don’t know the addressee; use your
first name only if you’re on a first-name basis with that person.
Immediately below your handwritten signature, you type your signature,
along with whatever complimentary and academic/professional degrees
and ratings you like to see following your name.
 Final notations: Two lines below your typed signature. If, for example,
the letter is typed by someone other than you, that person’s initials
appear here. If you are enclosing something with the letter, you may
type the notation enclosure or encl. If you are sending copies of the letter
to other people, you may type cc:, followed by the alphabetically listed
names of those receiving the letter.

Chapter 8: Sharpening Your Written Communication Skills

Memoranda
Memorandum is singular; memoranda is plural. If your Latin is weak, try using
memo or memos. Memos are written communications within companies or
within units of companies. Memos typically make announcements, discuss
procedures, report on company activities, and disseminate employee infor-
mation. They’re informal and public. If you have something confidential to
communicate, don’t do it in a memo.
The tone of memos usually is informal and friendly. Although you don’t need
to be curt, officious, or patronizing, a certain succinctness is acceptable.
Structure the memo so that the most important information comes in the
first paragraph and that subsequent paragraphs spell out what is discussed
in the first paragraph.
All memos are structured similarly. They have the following elements:
 An addressee: Flush left, in capital letters, near the top of the page
 The sender: Flush left, in caps, immediately below the addressee
 Date: Flush left, in caps, immediately below the sender’s name
 Subject: Flush left, in caps, immediately below the date
 Suitable paper: White bond, either note size or standard to fit most desk
in-baskets.
Figure 8-2 is an example of a properly structured memo.
Some people appear to think that the world can never have enough memos,
and they stuff others’ mailboxes to overflowing with them. Remember that
everyone is busy and has a job to do. Other people appear to think that
memos, because they are public, are effective management tools. Although
memos are effective for direction and suggestion, criticism and praise are
best given in person. If you must use a memo to criticize, make sure that the
criticism is not of the person, but of the performance.
Even though the majority of information today is conveyed via e-mail, it’s
important that the style of using an attached memo (document) is still 
an important style of writing in 21st-century business. Sending hard copy
memos may be a thing of the past, but it’s still important to use the correct
style when sending a memo in the body of an e-mail. When you’re conveying
larger amounts of information, it is better to send the information as a prop-
erly formatted memo attachment than to send it all via an e-mail blast. This
way the message can contain the correct headings, numbered items, and
other formatted information that an e-mail does not allow as easily.

Handling Formal Correspondence
At some point, you will have the opportunity to host social business events,
respond to an invitation, thank a colleague for a gift or an event, or announce
something for the business.
Business and social invitations
Include every bit of information that is required for the invitee to decide
whether to accept or decline the invitation. Make sure that everyone who
should be invited is invited, which requires consulting all the department
heads and other relevant people about their guest lists.
Although casual invitations are often extended by telephone, more formal or
larger events call for written invitations. Whether your invitation is in person
or in writing, here’s a checklist to guarantee that you include what you need
to (see Figure 8-3 for an example):
 Who is the function’s host? Having an executive name herself as host
gives the invitee a person to contact and thank.

121
Chapter 8: Sharpening Your Written Communication Skills

 What is the function? The nature of the event should be explicit.
 Where is the function? The place where the function will be held and the
phone number of the host are listed near the bottom of the invitation.
 When is the function? The time when the function will begin is listed. If
the event is a cocktail party, the time when the party will end is also
listed.
 Will food be provided? If the event is a sit-down dinner, the invitation
should say dinner. Cocktails in an invitation means that hors d’oeuvres
will be provided, but no more. Buffet supper means that the event will
feature something more substantial than hors d’oeuvres but less sub-
stantial than dinner. Cocktail buffet means that the event will feature
something more substantial than hors d’oeuvres but less substantial
than a buffet supper.
 Will dancing be involved? If the event will include dancing, say so.
 Will sports be involved? If the event will feature volleyball, basketball,
swimming, hang-gliding, or golf, say so.
 What is the expected dress? The style of dress should be specified.
Formal or Black Tie means tuxedos for men, while women have a couple
of options: either a long gown or a short, dressy cocktail dress. Evening
Formal means a dark suit, a white shirt, and a tie for men; women can
wear a short cocktail dress or a dressy pantsuit. Business Dress means a
regular suit and tie for men, while women can wear a dress, a skirt with 
a blouse, or nice slacks with a top or a sweater. Informal means blue
blazer and tie; and Casual Dress means business casual attire, such as a
nice colored shirt and slacks for men, and a nice dress or pants outfit for
women.
 How should invitees reply? The host determines how you should
respond — by e-mail, telephone, or by return reply card. If a reply 
is requested, the letters RSVP usually occur near the bottom of the 
invitation. If you see Regrets Only, that means that you do not have to
respond if you are going, but do have to respond if you are not going.
The most important thing to remember is to reply by whatever due date
was set by the host.
Thank-you notes
Thank-you notes are sent to the host within a day or two after the function.
These notes are short, gracious, and to the point. Two to three lines is a per-
fectly acceptable length; you don’t need to write several paragraphs. Thank-
you notes are not for discussing business or bringing the host up to speed
about your family life.

Chapter 8: Sharpening Your Written Communication Skills

Thanking people for something usually follows the form in which the invita-
tion was extended. If you receive a telephone invitation, a telephone thank-
you is appropriate, although a thank-you note is a nice touch. If you receive 
a written invitation, you should write a thank-you note.
Thank-you notes are not reserved for parties and dinners. The general rule is
this: If someone goes the extra mile for you, a thank-you note is appropriate;
if the thank-you is just for day-to-day business, a verbal “Thank you” is good
enough. Thank-you notes are always appropriate for gifts you’ve received.
Use white, cream, or gray paper for a professional look; texture and weight
aren’t as important. Note cards or fold-over notes (informal) in white, cream,
or gray can also be used. You can have these engraved, embossed, or printed
with your name or monogrammed in the center of the card’s front.
When you write a thank-you note, be sure to do the following (see Figure 8-4
for a sample):
 Thank the person for the gift.
 Recognize the effort that went into giving the gift.
 Tell the person how you will use the gift.
If you’re feeling at a loss for words in starting a thank-you note, try writing
these words: “What a [wonderful luncheon, fantastic evening at the theater,
thoughtful gift].” The rest of the note should flow from there. Try not to start
with “Thank you”; mention the event or gift, or make a general comment,
first.
Announcements
Businesses on occasion make public announcements of important events,
such as a move, a significant new hire or promotion, a meeting, or a signifi-
cant death. If you are asked to compose such an announcement (like the one
in Figure 8-5), keep three things in mind:
 Keep it simple.
 Get to the point immediately.
 Print it on correspondence cards, not letterhead.

Chapter 8: Sharpening Your Written Communication Skills

Addressing Envelopes for Business
First impressions are lasting impressions — especially with business corre-
spondence. Letters are mirrors that reflect your taste and character (or those
of your company). You should use printed envelopes that match your com-
pany letterhead with a printed return address. The recipient’s address should
be typed or printed by a software program.
Printed labels affixed to an envelope are not professional. Your letter could
get set aside or thrown away because the envelope looks like junk mail.
Keep these additional points in mind when you’re addressing an envelope for
a business letter or a business social event:
 Include your complete return address. If you are not using printed
envelopes that match your company stationery, print your name and
company name and return address legibly in the top-left corner of the
envelope. It’s also acceptable to write the return address on the envelope
flap, although the U.S. Postal Service prefers to have it on the front. A
complete address comes in handy if your recipient wants to post a reply.
Keep the lines aligned on the left. Write the street address and suite
number (if any) on one line. Start a new line for the city, state, and zip
code. Use numerals instead of writing out numbers, and make sure that
you use the postal code abbreviation for your state — that is, NY for
New York, IL for Illinois, AZ for Arizona, and so on.
 List the recipient’s formal title and address. Regardless of the informal-
ity of the letter itself, the address on the envelope should be complete.
The recipient’s name and title should go on the first line. The second
line is the street address, and the third line is the city, state (use the
postal code abbreviation with no periods), and zip code.
 Neatness counts! If you address the envelope by hand, write legibly.
Take a deep breath just before you begin. If you mess up somewhere
along the line, start over on a fresh envelope. Strikeovers, ink blots,
messy erasures, and the like are signals that you don’t really care, but of
course, you do care.
You can find more valuable information about addressing business envelopes

Keeping Up with 
Electronic Etiquette
In This Chapter
 Guarding information
 Communicating around the clock
 Displaying great etiquette on the Internet and via e-mail
 Understanding the rules for high-tech gadgets
 Using laptops and office equipment courteously
N
ew technology has turned business on its ear and created a whole new
set of etiquette conundrums. Yes, all this new technology saves time,
but it also contributes to the ever-more-hectic pace of life and work. In this
environment, in which everyone is trying to fit more activity into less time,
misunderstandings about etiquette are bound to arise. But the problem isn’t
technology; it’s the way technology is being used and abused.
You can easily forget good etiquette when you’re using the latest technology,
yet it isn’t too late to change your behavior by being aware of it and by being
sensible and considerate of others. (Emily Post didn’t know anything about
e-mail, but she did know that the essence of etiquette is putting other people
at ease.)
Although the information in this chapter may not be new to you, knowing the
rationale behind it is smart. No matter what, you must know how to present
yourself as a considerate professional when you’re using the latest technol-
ogy. (Be sure to review Chapter 7 for information on improving your phone
manners as well.)

Keeping Your Information Secure
Technology has made communication easier for you and me. It has also made
communication easier for the bad guys — those who want to steal your com-
pany’s proprietary technology, employee Social Security numbers, or other
confidential information. Yes, all this new technology sounds a little like
Mission: Impossible, but information security is part of business etiquette.
After all, what could be more impolite than letting your company’s secrets
fall into the wrong hands?
Because the character of the Internet keeps changing, and the lingo can be
confusing, the rules of common courtesy may be hard to grasp initially. Add
the fact that an online faux pas has the potential to reach millions of people
who have access to the Internet, and you may be a bit nervous about how to
act online.
Some companies ask new employees to sign a confidentiality agreement,
which states something to the effect that the employee will not share any
information he learns at the company to help another company succeed.
These agreements aren’t just formalities; they’re important, legally binding
contracts that dictate how you should conduct yourself. If you sign one, keep
a copy of it, and understand what it says.
Many large companies have specific guidelines about information storage
and security, document retention, and so on. If you’re not sure about your
company’s guidelines, ask. And don’t leave any hard drives behind the copier
or coffee machine!
Here are a few more guidelines:
 If you work with vendors, don’t reveal more about internal projects than
they need to know to complete the job. (Don’t share lists of employee
names and phone numbers, for example.)
 When you leave your desk for more than a minute, turn on your screen
saver, and set a password to lock it. If you’re not sure how to do this,
check with the person who set up your computer.
 When you leave at night, lock up your disks and documents. Make sure
that all confidential information is inside your locked cabinet and that
any piles on the floor are just magazines and unopened mail.
 If you travel with a laptop computer, don’t leave it in an unlocked confer-
ence room or sitting out in plain sight in your hotel room.
For complete details on security alerts, activities, reports, and updates, check
out the National Cyber Alert System: www.us-cert.gov. Also, the Federal

Trade Commission has created a Web site for consumers and businesses as 
a source of information about computer security and safeguarding personal
information. You can find further information by visiting the Web site:

Handling ’Round-the-Clock
Communications
In the old days, workers in the vast majority of professions had predictable
work hours. Most professionals worked from 8 or 9 in the morning until 5 or 6
in the afternoon, and any incomplete work waited until the next day. People
took lunch breaks every day. When Mr. Threemartini was out for the after-
noon, generally no one could reach him unless the situation was urgent. He
would return calls the next morning, when he arrived at the office to find a
stack of pink phone-message slips.
How things have changed! Now, with all the new technology — cell phones,
personal digital assistants (PDAs), and text-messaging devices, to mention
just a few — people are connected 24 hours a day!
In such an environment, everyone has to be a bit flexible in understanding
the needs and priorities of colleagues. If you’re the boss, don’t expect your 
3 a.m. e-mail to have been read before the 8 a.m. staff meeting. If you’re the
employee, be aware of your boss’s idiosyncrasies, and learn to anticipate
them (even if you’ll never love them). If you’re in either position, don’t call or
text-message someone after hours unless an emergency arises or you have
discussed the contact in advance (“Please contact me when you get those
numbers, Bob, and I’ll call you from the prime minister’s dinner party.”).
Here are a few additional guidelines:
 If you’re seized by a fit of creativity in the middle of the night, read your
e-mails again the next morning before sending them. Your idea (not to
mention your level of coherence) may look different in the light of day.
 Don’t practice voice-mail avoidance by returning all your calls at odd
hours. If someone has left a message for you, requesting specific infor-
mation, leaving a specific answer late at night is fine. If someone needs
to talk to you, however, don’t return the call at 10 p.m. and then insist
smugly that you have done your part. You’re not fooling anyone.
 If you send an e-mail that needs an immediate response, call to alert the
recipient.

Practicing Civility on the Internet
Some observers believe that the Internet has been a great democratizer
because it has made great volumes of information available to everyone 
who has access to a computer and modem. People who have never left their
hometowns can take virtual tours of the Louvre or travel anywhere in the
world by using Google Earth. But the world is made up of two kinds of
people: those who know how to use the Internet with élan and those who
don’t.
Be sure to keep these rules in mind:
 First and foremost, a business Internet account is for business. Even if
everyone else seems to be doing it, resist the temptation to shop for
shoes online during that interminable conference call. Some companies
may allow you to use your Internet account for personal use during
breaks or lunch hours, but ask first.
 Unless your job description requires you to participate in company blogs
and online chatting, you shouldn’t be doing these activities on company
time. If your job requires that you manage or respond to blogs and chat
rooms, make sure you use the appropriate etiquette. Most blogs and chat
rooms have rules and guidelines, so follow them! A few general tips: Use
the spell-checker, be accurate and honest, and stay on topic.
 Be aware that many employers monitor employee Internet use. Find out
whether your company has an official policy on Internet use, and be
sure to follow it carefully. Wouldn’t it be embarrassing to explain that
you were fired because you were updating your MySpace page or writing
comments in an inappropriate blog on company time?
 If it’s necessary in your job to navigate the Internet or intranet sites at
work, it’s important to remember that your communication is coming
from your work e-mail address. You’re bound to run into problems with
obsolete links, error messages, or outdated information. Some sites
solicit your information via Contact Us or Feedback links. Your feedback
is important, but remember that a real person will read your e-mail. Send
feedback such as “As a frequent user of your site, I find this problem
frustrating” rather than slacker-like feedback such as “Your site is lame,
and your company blows!” The ruder and less rational your feedback is,
the more likely the Webmaster will be to dismiss it as the raving of a
lunatic shut-in.
 You have no excuse for viewing adult Web sites at the office, even if you
do so after hours, when you’re the only person around. Despite the
uproar about children discovering inappropriate Web content, happen-
ing upon dirty pictures by accident isn’t easy. And with the current legal
climate around sexual harassment in the workplace, most employers
have a zero-tolerance policy for this kind of behavior.
130
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

 Some Internet service providers have rules and policies about online
behavior. If you’re at work and discover anything online that is inappro-
priate, that makes you feel uncomfortable, or that you believe is harass-
ment, contact your company’s IT department or the company’s Internet
service provider immediately.
Take the time to understand online lingo. Many Web sites list Internet terms
and acronyms. Knowing some of the key vocabulary will not only help you
communicate clearly, but also show that you are a savvy Internet user. For
the lowdown on Internet vocabulary, check out The Internet For Dummies,
11th Edition, by John R. Levine, Margaret Levine Young, and Carol Baroudi
(Wiley).
Figuring Out E-Mail Etiquette
A couple of years ago, e-mail surpassed postal mail as the highest-volume
carrier of messages. Its popularity has been booming ever since and shows
no signs of stopping. Though volumes have been written about the etiquette
of communicating through this new medium, many of the worst offenders
don’t seem to be listening. Are you one of them? The following sections
explain how to avoid some of the pitfalls of instantaneous communication.
Communicate clearly
The best feature of e-mail is also the worst: Communication with one or many
people, across the hall or across the world, can happen immediately. That
immediacy can be a tremendous asset when you need that kind of power. It
can also be a real problem when you use it as a substitute for thoughtful,
meaningful communication.
One problem with overusing e-mail is that your tone can easily be misunder-
stood. In person or on the phone, listeners can get visual or verbal cues, and
pick up emotions and nuances, particularly sarcasm. Even in the age of irony,
and even if you use the ubiquitous smiley, readers may miss your point. “I
heard Thursday’s staff meeting went really well!” has a completely different
meaning when it’s spoken in a sarcastic tone (the meeting didn’t go well at
all) than it does when it’s spoken in a happy, direct tone. Chances are good
that your readers will misunderstand this statement in an e-mail.
In a conversation, people often ask clarifying questions, as in this example:
“Did you send that report to Steve?”
“Steve Ferrill?”
131
Chapter 9: Keeping Up with Electronic Etiquette

“No, Steve Peterson. He wanted me to add some information about SLAs.”
“Well, I sent it to Steve Ferrill. What’s an SLA?”
You can easily see how, in an e-mail about Steve and SLAs, both parties could
end up confused. Always reread your e-mail message for clarity before you
send it, and follow up with a phone call if you don’t get a prompt response.
Write with style
Here are a few stylistic mistakes that people make when using e-mail:
 Forgetting the rules of spelling and grammar: Perhaps because of the
sheer volume of e-mails that people send, e-mail tends to be a very infor-
mal medium. Informal, however, should not mean sloppy. Watch for prob-
lems such as sentence fragments and spelling errors. If you’re not sure
about the rules of grammar, read Chapter 8, and purchase a style manual
such as The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White.
 Being unprofessional: Just because you’re sending an e-mail instead of a
memo or telephone call doesn’t mean you can let your professional stan-
dards relax. Although a touch of humor in the tone of an e-mail can be
fine, make sure you preserve your professionalism. Although smileys
may be helpful in social e-mails, try to avoid using them in business.
 Omitting a greeting and/or closing: Even worse is using “Hey” as a greet-
ing. Is it really that hard to type “Hi Charlene” or “Best wishes, Biff”?
 Using ALL CAPITALS: Capitals are harder to read than regular text. In
addition, many people view their use as the e-mail equivalent of yelling,
so if you wouldn’t scream something in the conference room, don’t type
it in all capitals.
 Using all lowercase letters: Are you e.e. cummings? If not, capitalize
proper nouns, names, and the first letter of each sentence.
 Using offensive language: Though you should watch your language at
work in general, spoken expletives float away into the air. Written ones sit
there on the computer screen, maybe for longer than you want them to.
Think before you send
Some other e-mail annoyances are simply the result of taking too little time to
think. They include
 Sending a message to too many people: Does everyone on your project
team need to see the details about setting up a conference room for next
Thursday? No. After you have completed the legwork with the person or
people who are really affected, you can notify others with a single message.
132
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

 Using Reply All or a similar function instead of Reply to Sender: If
your manager sends out a message thanking everyone on the team for
great work on the project, don’t respond to the entire group, telling him
that it was your pleasure and that he’s a great leader.
 Not double-checking the list of recipients, especially if the message says
something potentially negative: A public-relations executive received a
particularly irritating e-mail from a despised colleague. The executive
forwarded the note and her sarcastic commentary on it to a friend — 
or so she thought. In fact, she had clicked the Reply button and sent the
e-mail right back to her nemesis. Imagine her humiliation when she had
to apologize!
 E-mailing someone who sits across the aisle from you: If you’re recap-
ping a meeting, e-mailing is fine. But if you have a question for discus-
sion, try the old-fashioned approach of speaking to each other.
 Sending and receiving personal e-mail at work: The equipment and
Internet time belong to your company, so using them for personal 
purposes probably violates company policy. And although I know you
would never send anything potentially offensive or harassing from work,
it could be equally damaging to receive such material at work from a
friend.
Avoid venting
E-mail is a great tool for venting your spleen. Unfortunately, you shouldn’t do
it at work. Observe the following rules:
 Don’t use e-mail to lambaste a colleague, and especially don’t copy
others on the message. That’s tantamount to chewing someone out in
front of a room full of his peers. Disagreements or discipline are best
handled in person or at least over the phone.
 If you receive a scathing e-mail, resist the urge to write a similarly
scathing message in return. Take the high road. Offer the olive branch,
or at the very least, distract the other person by making him wonder
why you haven’t responded.
 Never, ever write something in an e-mail that you wouldn’t want pub-
lished in the newspaper. Even if you send them to people you trust,
e-mails that contain sensitive, mean, or potentially embarrassing infor-
mation have a way of being forwarded beyond your original audience.
E-mail should not be a substitute for face-to-face discussions and telephone
time, and e-mailing should not go on too long. After two back-and-forth
exchanges on the same issue, it’s time to pick up the phone.
133
Chapter 9: Keeping Up with Electronic Etiquette

Be aware that managers in e-mail-intensive companies may get 200 or more
messages per day! Take pity on them; be brief, and if you don’t get a response
when you need one, follow up by phone.
You should also return e-mail messages promptly, even if only to say, “I
received your message but won’t be able to give it my full attention until next
week.” If your e-mail program supports this feature, you should also set a
vacation auto-reply when you will be out of touch for more than a day or two.
The e-mail program will respond automatically to correspondents (usually,
only once to each person) to let them know that you’re away and not reading
e-mail.
Always remember to add the subject in the Subject line. This not only helps
the person quickly locate the e-mail at a later time, but it is also the polite
thing to do. One of the worst offenses in e-mail etiquette is how people use
the Subject line to send their entire message, leaving the text area totally
blank . . . not even an auto-signature. Although the sender may think it is only
one sentence, it is often an extremely long sentence. Regardless, it is not cor-
rect and is a sign of laziness. Subject lines are meant to be a quick reference
to what is written in the body of the e-mail.
Being Mannerly with High-Tech Gadgets
Today, many people seem to be more focused on their fancy gadgets than on
other people. Face-to-face meetings have become a low priority because
they’re constantly being interrupted by technology, and many people can’t
figure out what to do. What’s more important: the gadget or the person
you’re with?
If you don’t want to be seen as a rude person, consider the advice in the fol-
lowing sections when you use high-tech tools.
The same etiquette rules that apply to handheld devices apply to cell-phone
use. See Chapter 7 for more on this topic.
Managing text-messaging on PDAs
Be with the one you’re with! Social norms say that the person you are con-
versing with takes precedence over text-messaging on your personal digital
assistant (more commonly known as a PDA). This rule applies in business 
as well. Most businesses prefer employees not make personal calls and send
personal e-mails on company time. The same rule applies to text-messaging.
If the text message isn’t related to work, don’t do it. Or wait to respond during
134
Part II: Building Better Communication Skills 

your break, lunch, or after work. It is not only rude but also distracting to
check or send text messages in the presence of other people, whether socially
or for business.
Follow these additional rules for proper text-messaging:
 Before using any handheld device, consider your location. Sending text
messages is acceptable in semiprivate situations, such as in the airport,
in a cab or a train, alone in a café, or waiting in line. Just don’t hold up
the line by asking the person at the counter to wait until you finish 
sending or reading a message. When dining out with others, keep your
electronic gadgets neatly tucked away at mealtime — never left sitting
on the table.
 If you receive an urgent or important message in the presence of some-
one else, excuse yourself, and find a secluded corner where you can
communicate.
Listening to audio files on MP3 players
It’s best to check company policy first, however, most businesses allow their
employees to use MP3 players or other devices as long as they use a headset
or earpiece so the music or program does not disturb coworkers. Normally
this is fine in an office environment or if you work in a cubicle, or if your job
requires you to cover some background noise, such as that of a warehouse
worker. Just remember to keep the volume low. An exception applies to those
who work in the public eye, such as sales clerks or receptionists. In these
instances, listening to private selections is clearly inappropriate.
Shooting pictures and 
videos on cell phones
No longer a novelty, the camera phone has become ubiquitous. When it comes
to business, however, you should steer clear of certain things. A picture may
be worth a thousands words, for example, but think twice before you use your
cell phone to take covert shots of fellow employees or unreleased products
without approval.
Photographing or videotaping people you work with without their knowledge
or approval is not professional. Respect others’ privacy. Always ask permis-
sion before taking a photo or video of someone and never post photos to any
Internet sites unless you have a signed agreement.
135
Chapter 9: Keeping Up with Electronic Etiquette

Using laptop computers appropriately
What possible etiquette pitfalls could surround laptop computers? Here are
some:
 Some keyboards are quieter than others, but loud typing during a meet-
ing can be very distracting to your colleagues. If you’re getting the look
of death from the person sitting next to you, switch to a pen and paper.
 The same rule applies to conference calls; ambient noise can drown out
speakers. Set your phone on mute unless you’re speaking so that others
won’t hear you typing.
Using Office Equipment Appropriately
The key to using and sharing office equipment is remembering that it belongs
to everyone. Here are a few tips:
 If you notice that the fax machine or copier is out of paper, put in more
paper.
 If the fax machine or copier is broken, either fix it (if you know how to
do so without making the problem worse) or call someone who can fix
it. Then put a sign on the equipment to let other users know the problem
has been called in.
 If you need to make lots of copies, and someone else needs to make only
a few, let him go first.
 Have respect for the IT folks and other people who fix your office equip-
ment and maintain computers, phones, and other office equipment by
keeping it clean. Think of how much more pleasant your job is because
of them!

I
f you’ve been in the work world very long, you know that meetings are the
butt of frequent jokes, and, in many cases, the bad reputation that meet-
ings have is well-deserved. Conducting efficient and effective meetings is 
possible, however.
If you can master the art of the meeting, you will be a powerful asset to your
organization. And even if you’re not planning the meeting, you still need to
know the proper etiquette for your role as a participant.
Planning a Meeting
Planning a meeting can be a thankless job. Your work often goes unrecognized
unless something goes wrong, in which case you become the object of intense
scrutiny. If you’re lucky, though, your boss recognizes and appreciates your
skill. In the following sections, I provide some handy tips for figuring out the
purpose of a meeting, putting together an agenda, and scheduling an agree-
able time.
Determining the purpose
Perhaps the single most important element of a good meeting is purpose. You
must know why you’re holding the meeting and what you hope to accomplish.
If you’re initiating the meeting yourself, spend a few moments clarifying the
purpose in your mind. If you’re asked to plan a meeting for your boss, ask her
to take the time to explain her expectations.

A clear purpose is essential for a successful meeting. Ask yourself or your
boss these questions: “What goal (or goals) do we hope to accomplish? 
How will a meeting help accomplish this goal?”
After you’ve determined your purpose, make sure that a meeting will help
you achieve your goal. A meeting can be a good way to disseminate informa-
tion to several people at the same time. Although e-mail or other means of
communication can be effective, a meeting allows for eye contact, body lan-
guage, and opportunities to ask questions so as to clarify the information. 
On the other hand, a meeting may not be a good idea if the information is
unlikely to generate discussion.
Drawing up an agenda
After you figure out the purpose of your meeting, put together an agenda out-
lining what the meeting will cover. An agenda helps participants prepare for
the meeting, which minimizes choruses of the always-popular “I’ll have to get
back to you on that.” Ask participants to review the agenda and to come pre-
pared. No one likes to look disorganized and incompetent in front of a room
full of people. If you provide your coworkers an opportunity to prepare,
they’ll take advantage of it.
Be aware that if you don’t set an agenda, participants may arrive at the meet-
ing with their own hidden agendas — possibly ones you don’t like. A written
agenda puts you in the driver’s seat.
A complete agenda includes a list of topics to be covered, assignments of who
should be prepared to cover each topic, time estimates for discussion of each
topic, and start and end times. Be sure to leave a little more time than you
think you’ll need. You find out later in this chapter how to control the mus-
ings of those long-winded bores in your office, but you should still build in
plenty of time for discussion. Your agenda also should include the meeting
location and a list of attendees so that they can discuss items before the
meeting if necessary (or gird themselves for verbal battle).
Including all this information means you’ll have to hold off on your meeting
announcement until you have all the details. Resist the temptation to shoot
out an e-mail prematurely; otherwise, you’ll end up having to send two or
three messages, and people will start to think of you as unorganized.
If you’re new to the company or organization, consider consulting another
coworker or your manager to review your agenda. Nothing is more painful
than sitting in a meeting with exactly the same agenda items or strategies
that have been covered or tried previously. Otherwise, the attitude of the
attendees usually is “Been there, done that.”
140
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

Scheduling the meeting
Scheduling a meeting can be tough, and it gets more complicated with every
added participant. In some cases, you have to schedule a time that’s conve-
nient for the most important players and ask the other participants to
rearrange their schedules.
One strategy is to come up with three meeting times on different days and 
at different times of day, and then propose those times and ask people to
respond with their availability. E-mail and calendar-sharing software pro-
grams are excellent tools for this task.
In many corporate situations, a meeting is actually part of a larger event. Large
corporations with employees in several locations often host combination
meeting/social events to get managers or employees together in one place. 
If you’re in charge of putting together an awards banquet/golf outing/Cajun
cookout/all-night dance party, read the section in Chapter 13 on planning 
special events. With any luck, you can get help from a consultant or another
employee who can show you the ropes.
Taking a Seat
At a company that makes a point of minimizing hierarchy, seating arrange-
ments probably are no big deal. Even in many larger companies, seating
arrangements often are inconsequential at internal meetings that do not
include vendors or clients. In more formal sessions, however, you may need
to be aware of possible seating rules that affect where you should sit after
you’ve confidently strolled into the meeting.
Many people have theories about the psychology of seating arrangements:
that you should sit directly across from the most important attendee so as to
be noticed (or sit behind a large person if you don’t want to be noticed); that
you should sit at the right hand of the important person; that the right hand
of the important person is less impressive than the left hand; and on and on.
Probably some people even recommend sitting in the lotus position with
your fingertips pressed together for greater meeting harmony.
In fact, you need to follow just a few basic guidelines:
 Don’t sit where the host or most important attendee plans to sit, which
usually is at the head of the table — an easy task if that person is already
seated. If not, you can remain standing until she arrives or, depending on
the situation, take a seat that you know the boss won’t desire.
141
Chapter 10: Minding Your Meeting Manners

 If the host or the most important attendee has an assistant coming to
the meeting, the assistant probably will want to sit directly to the right
of the boss.
 If you start to suspect that you have chosen the wrong seat — for exam-
ple, if your boss is suddenly giving you that look — say something like
“Would you like to sit here?”, and make getting-up motions. This strategy
is far preferable to having your boss ask you to move.
 Always be flexible. If the room is small, for example, and the last arrival
will have to navigate around you to get to the last available seat, you
might offer to move.
If you are the meeting planner, you may give polite direction to attendees
about where to sit. You could say “Sebastian, why don’t you sit at this end?”
or “Miss Barker and Dr. Cooper, please be seated at the head of the table.”
Being an Effective Chair or Participant
Meetings may masquerade as a chance to update the status of a project or
catch up on industry developments, but they’re really used as a way to learn
about and measure participants. Whether you’re running the meeting or are 
a participant, meetings provide you with an opportunity to shine in front of
your peers and superiors. That’s why communicating by using all the right
verbal and nonverbal signals is important. The following sections tell you
what those signals are and how to use them to be an effective chair or 
participant.
When you’re running the meeting
When you’re the host, your job is to take charge and make sure that the meet-
ing runs smoothly. Meetings aren’t football games, so not every meeting
requires formal rules. Knowing the rules can be helpful, however, in politely
corralling boorish (or simply inexperienced) colleagues and letting them
know that they are out of line.
Starting the meeting
Your first job is arriving at all meetings a little early. If you’re in charge, your
next job is beginning the meeting promptly. Part of civility in the workplace is
respecting the value of everyone’s time. Those who sit around waiting for
latecomers to show up are understandably annoyed. Their schedules are also
full, and they don’t deserve this kind of treatment. If you develop a reputation
as a person who starts meetings on time, people will be more likely to arrive
142
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

on time to your meetings. Conversely, if you develop a reputation as someone
who always starts late, people will start showing up late, and the situation
will spiral downward.
In some cases, you may need to bend your starting-on-time rule if the boss or
some other very important attendee is late. Even so, you probably shouldn’t
delay for more than about 5 minutes. This person may exercise her prerogative
to have you repeat the part of the meeting that she missed. If you’re lucky, 
she will call in advance to warn you, apologize profusely upon arrival, and not
make this behavior a habit. Most people are late once in a while, but frequent
lateness is a subtle way of telling others that they’re not important — not a
good management strategy!
Adhering to the agenda with Robert’s Rules of Order
Another important job for the meeting host is sticking to the agenda. Though
you sent the agenda to all participants in advance, you may want to bring
along copies to distribute, ensuring that everyone knows what’s about to
happen. Then you should keep an eye on your watch so that you can hold up
your end of the bargain: Participants arrive at your meeting on time, and you
do your best to get them out on time.
To run a meeting effectively, you should be at least somewhat familiar with
Robert’s Rules of Order, a system of parliamentary procedures first published
in 1876. Although the system sounds daunting, Robert’s Rules are simply a
system for agreeing on how meetings should be run. Some of the rules are
extremely detailed, but knowing all of them isn’t necessary. You should, 
however, be familiar with the basic concepts of procedure.
Not all meetings are formal enough to require Robert’s Rules. Many of the
meetings you’ll run will be entirely informal affairs in which people get
together to hash things out. Yet even for these meetings, some procedure
must be followed. Everybody can’t talk at the same time, and you’ll have to
agree on some method for discussing the options, reaching a decision, and
implementing it. Knowing the basic steps of procedure, as Robert’s Rules
spells them out, can help:
 The moderator — usually, the same person as the host — is in charge of
keeping the meeting on track and preventing participants from interrupt-
ing one another. At the beginning of the meeting, the moderator should
make it clear what rules are being used, such as not interrupting while
someone is speaking and avoiding confrontations.
 Participants generally raise their hands when they want to speak, and
the moderator recognizes a speaker. If the meeting is a small one, you
don’t have to raise your hand above your head; a small hand gesture will
do the trick. Even a particularly earnest look may get across your desire
to speak.
143
Chapter 10: Minding Your Meeting Manners

 When a participant is recognized, she is said to have the floor, meaning
that she can speak for a reasonable amount of time about her suggestion
or point of view. If someone attempts to interrupt, the moderator has the
right to remind that person — politely — that someone else has the
floor at the moment. You can say something like, “Thank you John, how-
ever, you’ll have an opportunity to take the floor shortly. Let’s let Carol
finish.” The moderator should eventually recognize everyone who wants
to speak, of course.
Some organizations have been known to have an object of some kind
that is passed from speaker to speaker. Although this method makes 
it patently obvious who has the floor, it also has the disadvantage of
reminding people of the humiliating potty pass from grade school.
 In addition to preventing interruptions, the moderator should prevent
speakers from repeating themselves or blathering on too long. An appro-
priate comment might be “Gene, I think we have heard enough to under-
stand your position. I’d like to recognize Jezebel now and hear what she
has to say.”
 The speaker should voluntarily yield the floor when she’s finished speak-
ing by sitting down (if she is standing) or simply saying, “I’m finished.”
In some cases, a meeting includes voting. Meeting formality can depend on
the culture of the company. If the environment is more on the conservative 
or formal side, the following steps are normally followed:
1. After ideas have been discussed, a participant makes a motion (an
idea to be voted on).
The participant makes the motion by saying something like “I move that
the water cooler be filled with sparkling wine.” Although you, as the
moderator, usually don’t make a motion, you can start the process after
you feel that adequate discussion has taken place by saying something
like “Do I have a motion to fill the water cooler with sparkling wine?” At
that point, someone who advocates that position should jump in and
make the motion.
2. Another participant should second the motion.
3. You, acting as the moderator, ask whether further discussion is needed.
4. Say “All in favor, say ‘Aye’” and count the votes; then say “All
opposed, say ‘Nay,’” and count those votes if necessary.
If the discussion starts wandering far from the central topic, the moderator
or host should suggest that the new topic be tabled for another meeting.
Most participants will acknowledge the need to stay on track and finish 
the meeting on time, even if they are very concerned about the new topic.
144
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

If you are the chairman of an organization or find yourself leading meetings
frequently, you may want to pick up a guide to Robert’s Rules for easy refer-
ence. Even if no one else knows them, your familiarity will help you run an
efficient meeting. I highly recommend Robert’s Rules For Dummies by C. Alan
Jennings (Wiley).
Taking notes
Finally, as host or chair, you have to take notes. Taking notes isn’t glamorous,
but it’s an important part of a successful meeting. Though other participants
may take their own notes, those notes may not be comprehensive. As the
meeting host, you want to make sure that everyone who attended the meet-
ing ends up with the same record of what happened. If you’re lucky enough
to have an assistant at your disposal, you can ask that person to take the
notes and then simply approve them. If not, taking notes is your job.
If you use a laptop computer to take notes, be certain that the noise you make
typing does not distract the other participants in the meeting. You can do
this by asking the chair and other participants at the beginning of the meet-
ing whether using your laptop is distracting.
Unless your organization has a specific format for meeting notes, you can
include this information:
 Time and date of the meeting
 List of participants
 Agenda and notes of the discussion about each agenda item
 Any motions made and the resulting decisions
When you’re participating in the meeting
Some people arrive late at meetings, come in loudly, and start asking questions
about topics that have already been covered. Don’t ever be that person. If you
arrive late, keep quiet, and ask a sympathetic soul to catch you up later — not
while someone else is talking.
There’s no question that we live in a hectic and quick-paced world. Punctuality
is critical, however, not only for your career, but for your personal relation-
ships as well. Time is our most precious commodity, and wasting other
people’s time by making them wait for you is extremely rude. Be on time for
any meeting you’re participating in. Period! If you can’t help being late, call
ahead, apologize, and let the other participants know when you’ll arrive.
Afterward, send an e-mail apology to the chair of the meeting.
145
Chapter 10: Minding Your Meeting Manners

As a meeting participant, follow the procedures that the chair or host adopts.
If your host is running an informal meeting, your points of order are unneces-
sarily rigid. If your host is running a formal meeting, learn enough about
Robert’s Rules of Order to be able to participate effectively. (I discuss these
rules earlier in this chapter.)
You should never interrupt other speakers, of course. Also avoid the tempta-
tion to sigh loudly, roll your eyes, or otherwise express your contempt when
someone else is speaking. If you have a colleague who incessantly interrupts
others, please refer to Chapter 16.
You’re obliged to stay for the entire meeting unless you have another
appointment or commitment. If so, at the beginning of the meeting, let your
chair know when you’ll have to leave, and leave quietly at that time. If you’re
unlucky enough to be a participant in a meeting whose chair has not set an
adjournment time, and the meeting is dragging on and on, pass a note to the
chair explaining your other commitment, stand up, excuse yourself quickly,
and leave without making a show of it.
If you like taking notes, by all means do so. If you’re not fond of note-taking,
and someone else appears to be, don’t take notes. You’ll know after a couple
of meetings how accurate other people’s notes are. If you’re concerned that
the decisions made during the meeting diverge from the decisions reported
in the notes and subsequent memoranda, offer to take notes for the meeting.
You’ll be doing your chair a favor.
Always think before you speak and weigh your words carefully. Whether
you’re running the meeting or are a participant, always stick to the agenda.
Do your best to avoid harsh words, and don’t repeat yourself, blather on for
too long, or be offensive to anyone present.
One of the biggest mistakes in business today is acting rushed. This is partic-
ularly evident in a meeting when people begin looking at their watches or cell
phones for the time, clearly showing they are distracted, which means they
are not listening.

W
hy combine food and business? At first, the answer may seem simple:
time. Although it’s true that you often don’t have enough hours in the
day to complete business unless you schedule some meetings during meal-
time, sharing a meal is also a time-honored way of cultivating trust.
In a business meal, the devil and the deal are in the details. In this chapter, I
show you clever ways to stay organized, save time, and build relationships. 
I also provide suggestions for entertaining at home without anxiety.
The more formal the meal, the more emphasis on the social aspects of your
relationship. Informal meetings are for discussing business details, but formal
dinners are for building personal rapport. In Chapter 12, I introduce you to
the nitty-gritty of polite dining.
Organizing a Business Meal 
at a Restaurant
The most typical business meals are breakfast and lunch. Dinner usually is
reserved for special occasions or out-of-town guests. Breakfast meetings are
good if your time is limited and your agenda is short, but keep in mind that
not everyone is an early bird. Lunch is the default business meal. Its neutral-
ity implies neither the informality of a breakfast meeting nor the formality of
a dinner meeting.

Assume that you’ve decided to take someone out for lunch. The following
sections list the steps to follow.
Step 1: Schedule the lunch
Choosing the restaurant is your business, though you can make a couple sug-
gestions for your guest and let him select one. If possible, select restaurants
that you have been to, or choose a couple of restaurants that you think will
appeal to your guest. See whether reservations are available on the day you
want to take your client to lunch. Ask for two times: noon and 1 p.m. Also, 
the restaurant location should be convenient to your guest, not to you.
The actual invitation (extended during a phone conversation) can be phrased
like this:
Chris, I’d like you to be my guest at lunch next week. Would Wednesday or
Thursday work for you? Noon or one o’clock? Would you prefer Indian
Garden or Chez Chez?
After you’ve worked out the details, repeat them at the end of the 
conversation:
Great talking with you, Chris. I look forward to seeing you at Chez Chez at
noon on Wednesday.
Immediately call the restaurant to confirm your reservation and cancel any
other reservations.
Step 2: Confirm
A day before the meeting, check with your guest and confirm the date, time,
and location with either an e-mail or phone call, and confirm the reservation
with the restaurant.
Step 3: Pay before you eat
Arrive early at the restaurant, and ask the maitre d’ to take your credit card
and run it through for preapproval right away. Sign the receipt; add a gratuity
of 18 to 20 percent; and if you want, request that the receipt be mailed to you
in a stamped, self-addressed envelope that you provide. You also can estab-
lish a house account at the restaurant. Either way, the bill never appears at
the table, so there’s no confusion about who pays.
148
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

Step 4: Be nonchalant
Arrive at the restaurant about ten minutes ahead of your guest. When the
maitre d’ or hostess asks you, “Would you like to wait in the bar, in the lobby,
or at your table?” you choose the table. This way you can set the seating
arrangements and make sure you aren’t seated near the kitchen door or in
some other inappropriate location. If the table is not ready and it’s necessary
to wait, at least check the table location and wait in the lobby. Greet your
guest warmly by name and with a handshake.
Step 5: Take the worst seat
If you’ve not been seated at the table before your guest arrives and you’ve
met him in the lobby, motion for your guest to follow the maitre d’ to the
table. Allow him to have the best seat. Guests should never sit looking at 
a mirror or toward the kitchen door.
Once seated, pay attention to your posture and body language. Always sit 
up straight at the table with your feet flat on the floor or cross them at the
ankles, and leave your shoes on!
Step 6: Order carefully
Keep these guidelines in mind while you and your guest order:
 Take a couple of minutes to get situated. While you’re perusing the
menu, you can give your guest clues about the limits of your hospitality.
You might say, “Hmm, I think I’ll have a cocktail today” or “I think I’ll
have iced tea.”
You can help your guest by suggesting items from each course on the
menu. You might say, “The shrimp dumplings here are good, and they’re
famous for their green-chile corn chowder.” If you are on a tight com-
pany budget or company expense account, these suggestions can be in
the price range that is allowable. If money is not a problem, then don’t
be stingy! Recommend one of the more expensive entrees. As the host
you can encourage guests to order extra courses: “John, do have an
appetizer, soup, or salad before your main course.”
 Always order the same number of courses your guest does. If your
guest orders an appetizer, for example, you should too. This action pre-
vents the awkward situation that arises when one of you is eating and
the other is not.
If your guest is a light eater, so are you. You won’t starve.
149
Chapter 11: Engaging in Business Meals and Parties

 Once your food has arrived, be sure to use impeccable table manners.
See Chapter 12 for complete details.
Ordering at a business lunch has relaxed some in recent years. As encouraged
by the host, everyone may order as many or as few courses as they want.
However, it is a delicate balance. When in a group of three or more, it is best
to make every effort not to appear too hungry.
As a guest, never order extra courses, until encouraged by the host. If the
host says nothing, stick to ordering only a main course.
Step 7: Know when to start 
talking business
Unless the need to transact business is urgent and you and your guest have
agreed to get right down to business, don’t discuss business matters until the
end of the meal. Yes, not until the end of the meal! Granted, in certain fast-
paced businesses, this rule is broken so frequently that it’s no longer a rule.
Nevertheless, plenty of people still feel that business and dining don’t mix.
You should be able to get a feel for whether your guest wants to jump into
business talk right away or would like to be social first.
Here are some more tips:
 During business meals, you often see memos and papers on the table.
But resist the temptation to use cell phones or laptops at the table; the
restaurant isn’t your office. If you have to use all sorts of electronic
devices to conduct the meeting, have the meal catered in a conference
room or a private room in the restaurant.
 Don’t forget that other people in the restaurant are dining. They don’t
want your business interfering with their meal. Try to find a table
located at the edge or in the back of the dining area.
 Keep your voice low and pleasant.
 Don’t load up the table with your sunglasses, keys, and electronic gad-
gets. Put these things in a briefcase or handbag, and put them under the
table or on an empty chair.
 Turn off all beeping electronic gadgets, or turn on the vibrating option.
150
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

Planning the Perfect Social 
Event for Business
The time will come for you to welcome your business colleagues, bosses, or
clients into your home. You’ll want to make the experience as pleasant and 
as memorable as possible.
Whether your event is as simple as a weekend picnic for your colleagues and
their families or as complicated as a formal dinner for the president of
Venezuela and 50 corporate titans, your test as a gracious host is how you
plan the event and whether you can deal with unexpected disasters.
Your budget determines the kind of event you can host. If you have enough
money, you don’t need to worry about budgeting time and energy, because
you can hire people to do everything for you. If you’re considering having a
large, catered affair, read the suggestions about special events in Chapter 13.
If your goals are more modest, you can provide a gracious ambience and
good company all by yourself by following a few simple guidelines.
Staying organized throughout 
the planning process
Before pulling together your guest list, consider the reasons for having the
party. Do you want to celebrate a promotion, bid farewell to a colleague, or
have fun with some brews? Know your reasons, know your budget, and plan.
After you’ve determined the occasion and style, make a schedule to keep
yourself organized. At least 45 days before the party, you will
 Determine the guest list (see the next section for details).
 Plan the menu; prepare your grocery and beverage list.
 Select decorations and supplies.
 Arrange for a tent, tables, chairs, and other equipment, if necessary.
 Select linens.
At least a month to no later than two weeks before the party, you will
 Mail the invitations.
151
Chapter 11: Engaging in Business Meals and Parties

At least two weeks ahead you should
 Check your dishes and glasses for chips and cracks, and replace them as
necessary.
One week before the event, you will
 Select platters and serving dishes, matching each menu item to a con-
tainer and utensils. If you will be replacing buffet items, select the
second set of serving pieces, too.
 Choose appropriate music, and confirm that your extension cords are
long enough to reach the cabana.
 Order flowers, if appropriate.
One or two days before the event, you will
 Wash dishes, glasses, and flatware.
 Call any guests who have not responded.
 Buy groceries and beverages.
 Polish the silver, if necessary.
 Clean the house and yard.
 Prepare any food items that can be made in advance, and refrigerate
them.
 Coordinate last-minute arrangements with the caterer.
 Put extra hangers in the entryway closet, or provide a coat rack.
 Put away valuable and/or breakable items.
 Order ice, if necessary.
Consider how much time you’re going to have on the day of the party, and
arrange to have things delivered. Also, have enough help. Consider “hiring”
your own teenager or her friends to help you serve and clean up.
Assembling the right crowd
Sometimes, choosing the guest list is easy because the whole company
should be invited to the party; it gets tricky when some people will be invited
but not others. Try to make clear categories. You might invite the sales force
and their spouses or guests, for example, or the company’s clients, or the
people on your floor. The point here is to have a ready, justifiable explanation
for including some people and excluding others.
152
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

In the following sections, I explain how to assemble a great guest list and how
to issue invitations that contain all the pertinent information.
Including all the necessary information in an invitation
An invitation is the first news of your intention to host an event. The way you
word your invitations begins to set the tone for the affair. Invitations to casual
events can be creative and unusual, but those to formal affairs should follow
protocol. If the party has a theme, include it in the invitation.
Invitation basics include who, what, where, why, when, and how:
 Who is doing the inviting and who is being invited
 What you are inviting the person to do
 Where the party is being held
 Why the party is being held
 When the party will start and when it will end
 How to let your host know whether you will attend
If you plan an informal gathering of business associates, you can issue your
invitations orally, either in person or by telephone, but make sure that you’re
clear about the date and time of the affair. Say something like “We’d love to
have you join us for an informal brunch with a few others from work at our
house a week from Sunday. We plan to get together at 11, have brunch on the
deck, and play a little croquet in the yard for an hour or so.”
If you are composing a written invitation, make sure that it has all the rele-
vant information listed earlier in this section. See Chapter 8 for details on
writing invitations and addressing envelopes.
Considering significant others and children
Many business parties are just for groups of employees, but occasionally
more informal parties allow for significant others and children. Always men-
tion exactly whom you’re inviting when you issue invitations:
 For a married couple, mention both names.
 For a single adult whom you expect to bring a date, you do one of two
things, depending on whether the invitation is oral or written:
• If you’re issuing a phone invitation, say something like this: “Hi,
Steve. This is Juanita. I was calling to let you know I’m having a
party next Saturday at the beach house — a luau! Please bring 
a guest, if you’d like. The festivities will start around 5:00. Please
let me know by Wednesday if you’ll be able to make it. My office
number is XXX-XXXX, or you can reach me at home at YYY-YYYY.
Hope to see you.”
153
Chapter 11: Engaging in Business Meals and Parties

• If you’re issuing a written invitation or e-vite, first call the person
you’re inviting. Say that you’re planning to send him an invitation,
and ask whether he’d like to bring a guest. If so, ask him whether
he’d be kind enough to tell you that person’s name. Then send a
written invitation or e-mail directly to the guest.
 For couples who live together, both names go on a separate line of the
envelope. Roommates’ names are also listed on separate lines.
 Generally, children aren’t invited to formal parties, but sometimes they
turn up anyway. If you want them to attend, your invitation can simply
state that children are welcome.
Determining guest attire
A written invitation should include a freestanding line that specifies how you
expect your guests to dress (see Chapter 4 for more about proper dress):
 If you want to see the gentlemen in tuxedos, the proper phrase is Black
Tie.
 For suits and ties and cocktail dresses, people often use the phrase
Black Tie optional, or Semiformal, although Formal is technically correct.
 For a reception after work at which you expect everyone to wear suits,
use the phrase Business Dress.
 For slacks, sport coats, skirts, or pants, use Business Casual.
 For volleyball, use the phrase Casual.
If you’re not sure what to wear to an informal or casual party, call your host
and ask! Say something like this: “Hi, Sid. I’m looking forward to seeing you on
Sunday, but I’m not quite sure what to wear. Any hints?” If you’re the host, as
people respond to the invitation, say, “I’m so glad you can make it. It really
will be casual — shorts and T-shirts.” Let people know how happy you are
that they can come, and let them know what they can wear.
Providing directions and parking
Don’t make your guests search and fumble through an unfamiliar suburb or
area of town. Enclose a separate sheet of paper with accurate directions. If
necessary, make copies of a local road map, and point out landmarks and 
distances.
One of your responsibilities as the host of a large affair is to provide parking.
You can hire someone from a valet-parking service to park cars. Alert your
neighbors to the event, and let them know that your guests probably will be
parking on the street. If the parking situation is difficult, and your street or
home cannot handle a large number of cars, consider limiting your guest list
or hiring a shuttle for your guests.
154
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

If the event takes place at an establishment that offers valet parking, arrange
beforehand to handle the fees and gratuities for your guests. The invitation
should state that valet parking will be provided.
Dealing with RSVPs
If you’re having a casual party, you can request phone or e-mail responses 
to your invitations. Include your own phone number and e-mail address.
If you’re hosting an informal or formal party, send written invitations and
request an RSVP. For all but the most formal occasions, you can include a
separate response card — a note-size card that allows the recipient to
respond quickly.
The most formal invitations require that you respond in writing on fine sta-
tionery, echoing the wording of the invitation.
If you haven’t received an RSVP back from a guest within a week of the event,
it’s perfectly acceptable to call and ask whether he is attending. A guest
should respond to an invitation as soon as possible — certainly, within a
week of receiving it.
Finalizing preparations on 
the day of the event
On the day of the event, take care of last-minute details. Mentally walk through
the event. Review the names of guests, spouses, and significant others; com-
pany affiliations; and interesting tidbits from the week’s newspapers. Allow
plenty of time to set up and dress. Try to give yourself half an hour to relax
before the party begins. If you have a nonsmoking household, now’s the time
to make arrangements for smokers by reserving a place for them outside.
Above all else, maintain your sense of humor in the face of adversity. The most
important things are your attitude, friendliness, and genuine pleasure in your
guests’ presence.
Greeting your guests
As your first guests arrive, greet them at the door. Use their names; shake
hands; look them in the eye; and say, “I’m so glad you could join us.” As the
party progresses, you may have an associate or your spouse greet people by
saying, “Hello. I’m Joe Cook — Lynne’s husband. Lynne is on the balcony.”
Make sure that you’re close by and that the person who’s welcoming your
guests knows where you are.
155
Chapter 11: Engaging in Business Meals and Parties

Introduce newcomers all around the room until the number of guests gets too
large. When that happens, introduce newcomers only to the people who are
closest at hand. Keep an eye out for shy guests who plaster themselves to the
walls. Engage them in conversation, and introduce them to someone you
hope can draw them out.
Offer your guests a drink, or show them to the bar. Always have both alco-
holic and nonalcoholic beverages, including water, available during cocktail
hour. Keep cocktail napkins close at hand, or offer them with the drink. Serve
cocktails for no more than an hour, and provide appetizers and snacks while
serving alcoholic beverages.
Serve the most senior guests first.
Running the meal
How you organize the meal depends on the number of guests and the atmos-
phere that you want to create. Your main options are a buffet meal and a sit-
down dinner.
The buffet meal
A buffet works for 10 guests or 100. It is a great way to build camaraderie and
allow people to mingle. A buffet can be a bit formal or casual, depending on
the seating arrangements and style of food.
With a buffet, you can serve guests without having to traipse back and forth
to the kitchen. Arrange everything on a side table, stack up the plates and sil-
verware, and let your guests help themselves. Buffets can work beautifully if
you avoid a few hazards that can turn a party into a nightmare. Be sure to
156
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 
Handling the uninvited guest with grace
As a host, you face one of life’s bigger chal-
lenges when an uninvited guest arrives at your
carefully planned party. A guest may arrive with
someone you didn’t invite. Perhaps a relative
from out of town showed up unexpectedly, and
it seemed rude for your guest to leave him at
home alone. Perhaps your cubicle-mate shows
up with his brand-new girlfriend.
As a host, your job is to ignore your guest’s
breech of etiquette and to welcome any unin-
vited guest warmly, as though you were hoping
for just such a visit. Say how wonderful it is that
he can join you all. Begin making introductions
immediately. Rearrange the seating to shoehorn
the extra guest. SMILE! In the most absolute
last resort, with much regret, a host may decline
the additional guest if there are real circum-
stances that exist.

 Set up the bar away from the hors d’oeuvres and the buffet table to 
prevent congestion.
 Provide a drop-off table for cocktail glasses before the buffet.
 Think about traffic flow. Make sure people have enough room to get to
and away from the buffet table. Consider setting up the buffet table 
so that people can serve themselves from both sides.
 Set up glasses and dinner beverages on the dining tables so that your
guests don’t have to juggle food plates and drinks.
 Organize menu items in standard menu order — main courses first and
desserts last. (I describe the courses of a meal in Chapter 12.)
 Be sure to have backup serving dishes of each menu item so that they
can be replaced easily. Guests shouldn’t have to scrape the bottom of 
a serving dish.
Without exception, provide adequate seating for everyone invited. Rent
enough tables and chairs, or arrange your own furniture to accommodate
small groups. For very casual occasions, the floor and some cushions or 
the lawn and a few bales of hay are perfectly fine.
The dinner party
A dinner party is a small affair, usually with no more than 12 guests. Its busi-
ness function is to provide a gracious climate in which to build relationships.
The conversation at a dinner party should be general, social, and witty. The
food at a dinner party should be prepared and served in courses — at least
three and no more than five.
This type of party is an opportunity to use your wedding silver, your fine
china, and your crystal. If you don’t have enough matching plates and silver-
ware, mix and match, or have a party-rental company or your caterer provide
extra pieces.
If you can’t even remember what the inside of a grocery store looks like, let
alone attempt to provide a gourmet meal for 12 titans of industry, reserve a
private room at a good restaurant or hotel. Or hire a caterer.
Certain rules govern where guests sit during a formal meal. The host sits at
the end of the table. If a couple is hosting, the man sits at one end and the
woman sits at the other. The male guest of honor sits to the hostess’s right.
The next most important man sits on the hostess’s left. The female guest of
honor sits to the host’s right and the second most important woman sits to
the host’s left.
In many formal situations, guests are seated at round tables, which put every-
one on an equal basis. Whatever the shape of the table, couples should be
separated and men and women seated alternately.
157
Chapter 11: Engaging in Business Meals and Parties

As the host, you are the leader. When the time comes, move toward the dining
room; your guests will follow. After you have properly directed everyone to
their seats, you will take your seat as a sign that others should do the same.
As soon as all the guests are seated, place your napkin in your lap, which is
the signal that the meal has begun.
As soon as the wine is poured, offer a short opening toast. You might say
something like “Here’s to the great pleasure of dining with friends.” If a spe-
cial occasion has prompted the dinner, suit your toast to the event: “To a
wonderful new vice president.”
When it comes to serving food and drinks, if you remember only these three
things, you’ll do fine:
 Water glasses should be filled before your guests sit down at the table.
 Guests are served from the left, and dishes are removed from the right,
unless the arrangement of the tables and chairs does not allow this
system.
 Make sure that all the utensils for each course are on the table before
the food arrives.
For further information about table manners, see Chapter 12.
When you rise from the table after dessert, so will everyone else. Make sure
that the slowest guest has finished eating before you stand. When you lead
the way from the dining table to the living room or other conversation 
location, your guests will follow. Try to engage every guest in at least a short
personal conversation after the meal.
Ending the party
One of the toughest challenges for a gracious host is the delicate process of
getting your guests to go home. Moving your guests homeward is really a
two-sided issue, because they are expected to exhibit their own good man-
ners by knowing when it’s time to leave. The party should be over an hour
after dessert is finished.
If your guests are lingering too long, you don’t need to rely on hints or sub-
tlety. Stand up, say “This has been such a lovely evening,” and begin thanking
your guests for coming.
As people begin to leave, station yourself at the door; accept their compli-
ments; thank them for coming; and wish them a good evening. Don’t apolo-
gize for the roast being overdone or for running out of tonic. Just say how
pleased you were to have them at your party.
158
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

Drinks, Anyone? Understanding 
Cocktail Parties
Eating food while you’re standing up and holding a drink can be a real night-
mare. What are you supposed to do with those little toothpicks? Put them in
that ficus-tree pot over there? And how are you supposed to shake someone’s
hand when you’re holding a plate and a glass of wine?
Cocktail parties and receptions are among the favorite events for businesses
to host because they last for a short period of time, and cocktails and hors
d’oeuvres require a little less planning, less time, and less energy. And some-
times, if planned well, they’re easier on your budget than hosting a sit-down
formal dinner. Normally, cocktail parties and receptions have a larger guest
list, which gives the host an opportunity to meet or get to know more people.
There are three kinds of cocktail parties, each of which has its own function
and structure, as well as its own wardrobe expectations:
 A true cocktail party is usually about two hours long, starting sometime
after 5 p.m. and ending sometime before 7:00 or 7:30 p.m. Dinner is not
served at a cocktail party, but hors d’oeuvres are. A full bar is standard
at a cocktail party, with nonalcoholic drinks available for those who
don’t imbibe. This type of cocktail party is the most flexible of the three
types and can be casual to formal. Be sure to specify dress in the invita-
tion. The primary function of the party is to provide a forum for mingling
and meeting people.
 A cocktail buffet typically is held between 6 and 9 p.m. during the busi-
ness week. A buffet dinner is served (hence, the name). Tables, chairs,
and silverware are provided. Often, the food is varied, copious, and
served from different locations. The function of a cocktail buffet varies
from mingling to announcing a new product to thanking long-standing
clients. The event usually requires business dress. Again, be sure to
specify proper dress in the invitation.
 A cocktail reception traditionally is held for two hours before another
evening engagement — say, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. before an 8 p.m. 
theater curtain, or it can be held after an evening event, usually for only
an hour and a half. Champagne is usually served. Early cocktail recep-
tions serve hors d’oeuvres; and the occasional late cocktail reception
after a play or the theater often features egg dishes, such as omelets,
fruits, and desserts. Cocktail receptions are the most formal of the three
types of cocktail parties, usually reserved for making significant
announcements, honoring someone, or celebrating an important event.
Dressy or formal wear is in order. Again, be sure to specify proper dress
in the invitation.
159
Chapter 11: Engaging in Business Meals and Parties

When you attend a cocktail party without seating, you will be challenged 
to hold on to your food and drink at the same time. Here’s what to do:
1. Hold your drink in your left hand so that your handshaking hand
cannot be mistaken for a freshly caught mackerel.
2. If you are holding both drink and food and someone approaches you,
put the food on a nearby table and offer your right hand (unless shak-
ing hands would be awkward for the other person).
With a little practice, many people can master the art of holding a small
plate and a wineglass in their left hand. If you are unable to perform this
astounding feat, try to stay near tables or other surfaces.
3. If you cannot comfortably shake hands, smile and nod or shrug in
greeting; the other person will understand.
If you are the person making the greeting, it is rude to stand there with
your hand out while the other person is looking around for a place to set
his food and drink down.
Attending a Banquet
A banquet is a large luncheon or dinner typically hosted by a company or
other organization; awards sometimes are presented at banquets. At the
event itself, your job as host is to ensure that all your guests are satisfied.
You will be milling, mingling, and massaging the situation most of the
evening. You probably won’t eat much. Don’t fret. Your job is to talk to every-
one, guarantee that people get what they want, and provide the necessary
social skills to make the event a success for both yourself and your company.
You can help yourself to food and drink, but only to the extent that doing so
doesn’t compromise your ability to be an effective host. (If low blood sugar is
a problem for you, eat a substantial snack before the event.)
If you’re the guest at a banquet, the guidelines that apply to any business
function apply here as well. Don’t overeat or overdrink; be polite to those
whom you meet; and never forget that as pleasant as the surroundings may
be, this event is a business function at which business conversation is going
to happen, so be prepared to talk business at least some of the time. (See
Chapter 5 for general information on meeting and greeting at business 
events; Chapter 13 has details on acting appropriately at special events.)
One other piece of advice: Leave before or at the stated ending time for the
event. The polite guest knows when to leave.
In the following sections, I explain the responsibilities of a host and a master
of ceremonies, and I give a few tips for giving a toast at a banquet.
160
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

Acting as host and master of ceremonies
The host is the person who represents the organization having the banquet —
often, the president, CEO, or chairman of the board. The master of ceremonies
announces and introduces speakers, those who offer toasts, and other enter-
tainment. Sometimes, the host is also the master of ceremonies. When differ-
ent people perform the different functions, remember to direct your logistical
questions about the event to the host’s office and any questions about enter-
tainment to the master of ceremonies.
As a host for an event, make the appropriate contact people available to your
speaker and guests.
Dinner speakers are common at large banquets and are often members of the
company itself. Sometimes, they are celebrities or experts in other walks of
life. The purpose of dinner speakers varies from providing reports on techni-
cal matters to offering comedy for the evening’s entertainment.
Many professional speakers travel with an aide-de-camp or an entourage.
Figure out who is in charge, and talk to that person. Some speakers like to
make the decisions themselves; others prefer to delegate these matters 
to their handlers. Know your speaker’s preferences.
If you’re the host for a dinner speaker, your primary responsibility is to ensure
that the speaker is at the right place at the right time and has everything he
needs. This means making sure that the master of ceremonies knows how 
to introduce the speaker, that the speaker is aware of all the details of the
scheduled appearance, and that any technology the speaker will use (such 
as a projector, laptop, and microphone) has been tested and is ready to go.
Remember to do the following as well:
 Ask whether the speaker would like instructions on using any of the
technology.
 Ask the speaker whether he requires anything else.
 Introduce the speaker to important audience members during cocktails.
 Supply the speaker with water for the speech and be sure that their meal
is served ahead of other guests, just following the guest of honor.
As master of ceremonies, you introduce the speaker. Introductions need not
be long — good introductions usually are two minutes or less — but they
should be prepared. Recognize that your impromptu witticisms may desert
you as you face a thousand people in a brilliantly lit banquet room. Write
something down ahead of time in a size large enough to read.
161
Chapter 11: Engaging in Business Meals and Parties

Making and receiving a toast
Toasts can be made with wine or any other beverage. Traditionally, you do
not toast to yourself, although some people now think that it’s okay to raise
your glass in response. In either case, you do not drink if you’re the one being
toasted.
Toasting was once a man’s job, and only the men drank the toast while the
women nodded and smiled. Now it is perfectly appropriate for anyone to
make a toast and for anyone to respond to the toast, regardless of gender.
Are there any rules left? A few:
 The host can and should propose the first toast (a welcome toast) to
begin the dining.
 If the event has a guest of honor, the host proposes a toast to that
person.
 If the guest of honor is a dignitary, a very important person, or a distin-
guished elder, it is a sign of respect for everyone to rise to perform 
the toast.
The guest of honor, regardless of gender, responds to the toast by thanking
and toasting the host, and thanking everyone for their attendance. In fact,
guest of honor or not, if you’re toasted, you should always respond with a
toast.
At large events where you want to command the attention of a room or of
more than one table, rising for the toast is traditional. For smaller events,
rising isn’t necessary; simply ask for everyone’s attention. When you have
the floor, be respectful; take a minute or less to make the toast; and be seated
again.
Clinking your crystal with a fork to get attention is gauche and potentially
dangerous.

W
ell done — you’ve been invited to the company’s annual awards cere-
mony at the ritziest room in town. But instead of thrills, you’ve got
chills. They didn’t teach you how to go to one of these affairs in business
school. When you ask your parents how to go to one of these things, they 
just laugh, recalling that in the commune, formal meant wearing shoes. No
help there!
You need a quick course in dining etiquette. Not just in basic eating, either —
you’ve got to know what to do with that place setting from Titanic. You don’t
know a Chardonnay from a Beaujolais, let alone how to locate your bread
plate. Relax! Meals are supposed to be fun and entertaining — even business
meals. They often aren’t, of course, but by the end of this chapter, at least
you’ll know how to handle yourself with grace at any business meal. 
Bon appetit!
Starting Any Meal on the Right Foot
Whether you’re having lunch with well-known business associates or sitting
down to a formal dinner with complete strangers — who just happen to be
your company’s most important clients — knowing dining etiquette will help
put you and others at ease. Good manners are like the handrails on a rope
bridge. You may not be dashing across the chasm like Indiana Jones, but if
you hang on tightly, you won’t fall off!

Attending to preliminaries
As I note in Chapter 11, if you’re the host, arrive early to make arrangements
for paying the bill. Make sure that the table or room is what you had arranged,
and decide on the seating plan. The guest or most important person sits in
the best chair (normally, the one with the best view and location). The maitre
d’ can help you identify that seat. Everyone should be able to see everyone
else and converse easily. Have large flower arrangements or other obstacles
removed from the table by the waiter or maitre d’ if you think that they will
be distracting. Return to the bar or waiting area to greet your guests.
Do not order a drink before your guests arrive. Even if you have arrived 20
minutes earlier to make sure everything is in good order, it should appear 
to your guests that you, too, have just arrived. Don’t start off by making your
guests uncomfortable, thinking that they are late or have kept you waiting.
Some restaurants will not seat you until your entire group has arrived. In this
case, for business lunches, you will wait in the lobby, not the bar. For dinner
events, it is appropriate to wait in the bar and perhaps have one round of
drinks before being seated for dinner.
As each guest arrives, get off to a good start by making formal introductions
(see Chapter 5 for guidance). Unless doing so is unwieldy, everyone should
stand for an introduction and exchange handshakes (if the parties are being
introduced for the first time).
In the international business arena, business cards are never exchanged at
the onset of a business lunch or dinner. The reason for the meal is supposed
to be social and only at the end are business cards more appropriately
exchanged.
Mentioning the purpose of the gathering is appropriate. Try something like
this: “I know we’re all thinking about the roll-out schedule, which we will get
to. But first, I’d like to invite you all to just relax. We’ll save that discussion
for the end of the meal.”
Coming to the table
After introductions, cocktails, and pre-dining chitchat are complete, you just
sit down at the table, right? Wrong. At business meals, the host or lead busi-
nessperson should seat clients first and her business associates second. In
formal business occasions, the seating is predetermined by place cards. 
In diplomatic situations, ladies are seated, but men do not sit until the host
or guest of honor is seated.
164
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

Never switch place cards at a business function. You may be more comfort-
able, but considerable thought involving business strategy probably has gone
into the seating plan. Moving the cards around might be a ticket to Palukaville.
Before sitting down, make sure that you know everyone at the table. If you
don’t, make last-minute introductions. Unlike in social situations, it is not nec-
essary for men to seat women at a business meal. Regardless of your gender,
however, if you are to the left of an elderly woman or man, or someone who
requires assistance, you may always draw the chair for that person and assist
as needed.
Behaving after you’re seated
After you’re seated, wait for your host to take up her napkin and place it on
her lap. Then place your own napkin in your lap. Unlike in a social situation,
in which guests wait for the hostess to touch her napkin, in a business situa-
tion, hierarchy replaces gender.
Opening a large napkin fully isn’t necessary, and you should avoid flourishing
it like a bullfighter’s cape. The purpose of your napkin is to dab the corners
of your mouth — not to wipe off lipstick or blow your nose. If you leave the
table during the meal, place your napkin on your chair. When you’ve finished
your entire meal and are leaving the table for the last time, place your napkin
to the left of your place setting.
Posture at the table should be straight but not stiff. Lean slightly forward
from the back of the chair, but never slouch. Sit on three quarters of the
chair, with your feet flat on the floor. As you eat, bring the food to your
mouth; do not bend forward to meet it halfway.
Sit up at the table throughout the meal, and remember not to support your-
self with your forearms or elbows. Your elbows are never to be on the table
when people are eating. This posture is permissible only when you are
attending a casual social meal with friends and no food is on the table. In
addition, never encircle your plate with one arm while eating. You may rest
your wrists on the edge of the table, but lightly. Even though doing so may 
be tempting, don’t rest your head in your hands between courses.
Don’t fidget! That means don’t plink on the table with your cutlery or play
with the tablecloth, your napkin, cocktail stirrers, appetizer picks, your hair,
your fingernails, or anything else that’s close to hand.
165
Chapter 12: Mastering Dining Etiquette

As soon as you’re seated, informal conversation is in order. Avoid discussing
your personal life, sex, politics, or religion, and avoid telling jokes. You want
cordial conversation, not controversy. See Chapter 6 for pointers on making
polite conversation.
A drink or two before dinner as an icebreaker is perfectly acceptable and, for
some, a way of life. If you intend to conduct business, however, protect your
mental clarity. Remember, loose lips sink ships.
There’s nothing wrong with ordering mineral water or iced tea, regardless of
the choices others make. When you are the host, the best practice is to follow
the lead of your guest. You can offer a cocktail, but if your guest doesn’t
order one, abstain as well. If you’re a nondrinking host, suggest to your
guests that they have cocktails, and offer to order wine during the meal.
It takes time for a productive discussion to develop. One purpose of chitchat
during the meal is to warm up. This is the time to build rapport. If you’ve had
a lively conversation during the meal, everyone will be primed to talk about
the business plan over coffee. On the average, allow about two hours for 
a business meal. Be prepared to spend as much time as necessary at the
meal. Don’t book an appointment too close to the time when you think 
the meal should end, because you don’t want to be rushed or appear to 
your guests to be preoccupied.
Beginning the meal
When should you start to eat? Almost every meal has a host (the person who
invited you to the meal or the person in whose home you are dining). It’s
your turn to eat when — and only when — your host begins to eat. If it’s a
formal meal, unless you are choking, avoid having even a sip of water until
your host does.
If you’re attending an informal business lunch, it is acceptable for a guest to
take a sip of water before the host does, but never at a formal dinner party.
If you’re at a banquet or other group situation, wait until all those around you
have been served the first course, and begin to eat together. If the first course
is brought to the table in groups of two or three plates, and not everyone has
food yet, wait until everyone has food. Sometimes, the host will encourage
you to eat by saying, “Go ahead. Please don’t wait.” In this case, begin eating.
Or, if you want, you can still wait for everyone to have the course before you
begin, chatting with the other guests in the meantime.
166
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

The host may offer a toast before the meal. The toast should be simple and
short. Something like “Here’s to dining with esteemed colleagues” is fine.
A Primer on Basic and 
Formal Table Settings
The first step in intelligent utensil use is learning where the basic utensils and
dishes go on a dining table and how to use them. Then you’ll be ready for
advanced utensil information — those additional utensils and china you may
encounter in formal dining. At every meal, you have a plate, a napkin, several
utensils — usually consisting of a knife, fork, and soup spoon — and at least
one glass. Sometimes, you have a bread-and-butter plate. When you add a
salad fork, you’ve filled out the simple place setting that most Americans rec-
ognize. Sometimes, a salad plate rests on the table rather than being delivered
with the salad, and the dessert utensils, dessert plate, and coffee or teacups
and their spoons may appear after the meal. See Figure 12-1 for an illustration
of a basic table setting.
The basic setting is an abbreviated version of a full or formal place setting,
which can have any number of other utensils, plates, and glasses.
Figure 12-1:
An
American
basic table
setting.
167
Chapter 12: Mastering Dining Etiquette

The most important rules to learn in dining, whether casual or formal, are
 Drinks right, bread plate left. (Another version is liquids to the right,
solids to the left.)
 Fork is a four-letter word, as is the word “left.” Knife is a five-letter
word, as is the word “right.”
 Start by using the utensils placed farthest from the plate and work
inward with each course. By examining the formal place setting in 
Figure 12-2, you get a good idea of what each course will be.
Plates
The place plate, or main dinner plate, is in the center in front of each chair
setting. In formal dining, you usually find a charger (underplate) as well. The
bread plate is always to the left, slightly above the forks, with a small knife
across the top. That knife is the butter spreader. If soup is served as a first
course, the soup bowl will be on a service plate. A salad, if served as a first
course, may be placed on the service plate, and the salad plate will then be
removed. The charger or underplate is removed from the table before the
dessert is served.
Toward the end of the meal, you may find a small plate with a doily and a
small bowl above your dinner plate. These items are the dessert plate and
finger bowl, respectively. A small fork and spoon — your dessert spoon 
and fork — will be resting on the edge of the dessert plate.
Utensils
Forks are to the left of the plate, and knives and spoons go to the right (with
the exception of the tiny cocktail fork, which is placed on the soup spoon or
to the right of the soup spoon). The dessert fork and spoon are above the
dinner plate.
If a salad is the first course (as is often the case in the United States but
rarely the case in other countries), the salad fork, which is smaller than the
dinner fork, will be farthest to the left. If fish is being served as the first
course, a fish fork comes first. Next is your dinner fork for the entree. Salad
sometimes is served as the third or fourth course, in which case your salad
fork is closest to the plate. The butter spreader is on the bread plate on the
left above the forks.
To the right of the plate, starting from the outermost utensil, are a cocktail
fork, a soup spoon, a fish knife, a dinner knife, and (nearest the plate) a 
salad knife. The sharp edge of the knife is always turned toward the plate.
168
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

A dessert fork is placed horizontally above the place plate, tines right; a
dessert spoon is placed horizontally above the place plate, bowl left. All
these additional knives, forks, and spoons have specific functions — and to
add to the confusion, a few look slightly different in Europe than they do in
the United States.
If you’re unsure which utensil to use or do not know how to eat a certain
food, it is best to delay by having a sip of your beverage and watching what
the others are doing.
Glassware
In a formal setting, you usually have lots of glasses at the table. These glasses
are to the right of your plate. Each glass is slightly different in shape and size.
Their purposes are fairly easy to master; your waiter will fill the glasses with
the correct beverages in the right order. As long as you are not drinking from
an empty glass, you will be fine.
Figure 12-2:
An
American
formal table
setting.
169
Chapter 12: Mastering Dining Etiquette

The glass farthest to the right may be a sherry if one is served to accompany
the soup course. This glass will be the first one you use. When each course 
is finished, allow the waiter to remove the glass, as well as the plate, for that
course. Next is the white-wine glass, which is used during the fish course or
appetizer. Behind the white-wine glass is the red-wine glass. This glass is
larger, with a fuller bowl that allows the red wine to breathe. The largest glass
is the water goblet, which sits closest to the center of the dining table, often,
just above the dinner knife. Finally, behind and to the right of the water
goblet is the champagne glass, if champagne will accompany dessert. You
may also find a champagne glass in the first position, perhaps served with
oysters as an appetizer.
Salt and pepper
Most table settings include salt and pepper shakers or grinders. At formal
meals, you’ll see individual salt and pepper dishes with tiny spoons.
In some situations, where there is no salt or pepper on the table, do not ask
for any salt; this is considered an insult to the chef. It is fine to ask for pepper,
however, because it is considered a condiment and salt is considered a flavor
enhancer.
Thoughtfully taste your food before you add any seasoning. The chef has
tried to achieve perfect seasoning, and when you reach for the salt and
pepper immediately, you indicate that perfection was not quite achieved.
Always pass the salt and pepper as a pair so that they can stay together
throughout the meal.
The Meal: Managing Basic 
to Formal Dining
Knowing proper dining etiquette and using table manners simply gives you
more confidence in embracing new dining experiences, especially important
in business situations. Dining graciously, whether it’s a job interview over a
meal, dining at the White House, or dinner at your boss’s home — not only
makes you more comfortable, but it also makes a positive lasting impression.
If the food or the wine is especially good, mention it to your host, but keep
complaints to yourself.
170
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

Ordering food
As I note in Chapter 11, you may suggest items from the menu for the guests,
but when the time comes to order, follow the lead of your guests. Order an
item similar to theirs and in the same price range. If they order appetizers,
you should order one too, so that your guests don’t have to eat alone. At a
formal dinner, a menu card will be presented to you, with each course to be
served printed on the card. The date, location, and purpose of the dinner
appear at the top. This card is the main (or only) keepsake for guests.
Avoid selecting the most expensive item on the menu. If a client or your
employer will be paying for the meal, it’s best to order from the mid-price
offerings. If you dine in restaurants that specialize in international cuisine,
and you don’t speak the language, take the time to learn four or five food
items ahead of time. It’s also acceptable to request assistance from the
waiter.
During a business meal, your mind is on business, even if the preliminary
chitchat is about Tiger Woods. Don’t overburden yourself by ordering foods
that challenge your table manners and your wardrobe. As you survey the
menu, be alert to the following hazardous foods:
 Deeply colored sauce or gravy
 Spaghetti
 Food that requires on-the-plate management, such as whole lobster,
crab, and spare ribs
 Finger foods such as hamburgers or French fries
 Unfamiliar foods that may challenge your digestion or allergies
If you have special dietary needs, and you know in advance where you will be
dining, call ahead and discuss your needs with the restaurant personnel.
Serving food
In banquets or banquet-style serving, platters of food are served from the left.
A serving spoon and a serving fork usually are on the serving platter, spoon
with bowl up and fork with tines down. Take the fork in your left hand, tines
remaining down, and use it to steady the food. Using the spoon in your right
hand, lift the food, and steady it with the fork while bringing it to your plate.
171
Chapter 12: Mastering Dining Etiquette

Serve the food in individual portions, as it is presented on the platter. Don’t
take more than one portion. If the food is presented as a whole — mashed,
grouped, or in gels — take a portion with the spoon, using the spoon side-
ways to cut if necessary. Return the spoon and fork to the serving plate as
they came to you: spoon bowl up on the right, fork tines down on the left.
Distinguishing between American 
and Continental dining styles
There are two methods of handling and using the silverware at a meal: the
American style and the European or Continental style. Either version is fine in
the United States.
In both the European and the American style, you cut your food as follows:
1. Hold the knife in your right hand.
2. Place your index finger on the handle and a little of the blade, if 
necessary.
3. Hold the fork with your left hand, prongs facing down (with the curve
pushing up), as shown in Figure 12-3.
4. Eat your food one or two bites at a time.
Figure 12-3:
Cutting food.
172
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

At no time should you hold your utensils in any fashion other than those sug-
gested in the following sections. Whether you’re left-handed or right-handed
doesn’t matter. Never saw your food; simply request a steak or meat knife.
Never cut all your meat into bites at the same time. Don’t place your utensils
on the edge of the plate by their tips, letting them hang onto the table; after
you pick up your utensils, they should never touch the table again. And don’t
wave your utensils around while you’re talking; you’re not conducting an
orchestra!
The American style
In the American, or zigzag, style, after you finish cutting, you lay the knife on
the plate near the top of the plate, cutting edge facing in, and switch the fork
to your right hand after cutting your food. Holding the fork with your thumb
over the end and your index finger underneath, and the prongs up, you pick
up the food, either with the prongs, as shown in Figure 12-4, or by slipping
the food onto the prongs.
When you finish a course, you place your knife and fork side by side, knife on
top, in the 4 o’clock position on the plate, the blade of the knife facing in (see
Figure 12-5). This way, your server knows that you have finished this course
and she can remove those dishes and utensils.
Figure 12-4:
Eating
American
style.
173
Chapter 12: Mastering Dining Etiquette

If you want to rest between courses, you use the same position, but space the
utensils farther apart and slightly higher on your plate, as shown in Figure 12-6.
The European or Continental style
In the European or Continental style, you simply use the fork to prong the
bite and bring it to your mouth with your left hand. Raise the fork to your
mouth with the tines down but turning your forearm toward your mouth. 
The knife stays in your right hand, ready to be used again, as shown in 
Figure 12-7. If you put something on the tines of your fork, use a gentle nudge
from your knife. You may also rest your wrist on the edge of the table while
you hold your cutlery.

174
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

To rest your cutlery in the European or Continental style of eating, you cross
the fork (tines down) across the knife, cutting edge in, in the 4 o’clock posi-
tion, as shown in Figure 12-8. Place your utensils in either of these positions 
if you must leave the table, take a drink, or use your napkin. The finished
position is the same as in American style, but with the fork tines down.
Taking bites of food with grace
Conversation will continue during the meal, so be prepared to participate.
Don’t get caught chewing a large hunk of pork chop when the company presi-
dent asks you how your children are doing in school. Remember the sage
advice of President George Washington: “Put not another bit into your mouth
till the former be swallowed. Let not your morsels be too big for the jowls.”

175
Chapter 12: Mastering Dining Etiquette

Take small bites, always remember to chew with your mouth closed, and
don’t talk while you have food in your mouth. Though it’s acceptable in some
cultures, in the West it’s never acceptable to pick your teeth while you’re at
the table. Excuse yourself and go to the restroom if you have food stuck in
your teeth.
Following etiquette for basic courses
The following sections cover the basic courses diners encounter most often.
After finishing a course, don’t push your plate or bowl away. The way your
cutlery is placed informs the wait staff that you’ve finished. If you’ve placed
your cutlery properly in the 4 o’clock position, the staff also can pick up your
plate easily. Never “help” the wait staff by handing them plates or holding
glasses for them to fill unless you’re asked to do so.
A sorbet or intermezzo may be served between courses to cleanse the palate.
You need to have only a small taste; finishing the entire dish isn’t necessary.
If you’re planning a personal menu card for your guests, you don’t have to
include the intermezzo in the menu. If you think that some of your guests may
be confounded by the course, however, list it. Think of your guests’ comfort.
Bread
As a guest, if a bread basket or bread plate is sitting in front of you, you may
generally begin by taking one slice or roll, as directed by the host, then pass-
ing it. If the table is round, offer the bread to the person on your right. As the
host, you will not take bread first, you will wait to take bread until the bread
comes back around at the end.
When bread is served half sliced in a basket with a napkin, take a portion of
the napkin with your left hand and hold a section of the bread, without touch-
ing the bread, while you tear off one piece with your right hand. The napkin 
is in the basket to cover or protect the remaining bread.
176
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 
Eating French fries in France
American table manners allow for considerable
latitude in the use of fingers while dining infor-
mally. European etiquette, however, is much
more formal, even during a casual meal.
Americans will eat French fries with their fingers,
for example. But in France, pommes frîtes are
eaten with a knife and fork. When you dine over-
seas or with an international group, be especially
watchful for the behavior of your foreign com-
panions. When in doubt, use a knife and fork.

Place butter from the serving dish on your bread-and-butter plate, not directly
on the bread. Never use the knife with the butter dish to butter your bread. If
no knife is with the butter dish, you may use your own butter spreader or
dinner knife.
Break off a piece of bread only when you’re ready to eat it. Do not butter the
entire slice or roll at the same time. Break off one piece, hold it over the plate
to butter it, and eat it. If you’re eating a crunchy hard roll, keep it as close to
your bread plate as possible; it’s not the end of the world if a few crumbs get
on the table. The wait staff will take care of them later in the meal.
Whether at an informal or formal meal, dipping, dunking, or wiping sauces
with your fingers holding bread is not polite. Instead, you are allowed to
place a small piece of bread into your soup or on your plate, but use your
soup spoon or fork to move the bread around and then carry it to your
mouth to eat, except in the most informal gatherings or with certain dishes
that are designed to do just that — such as fondues, certain au jus dishes,
and olive oil. If you are dipping your bread into a communal plate of olive oil,
never, ever double dip! Take smaller bites.
Soup
Soup is served in a variety of bowls and cups, hot or cold. Clear soup is served
with a small round soup spoon; cream soup and soup with ingredients such
as chicken or vegetables will have a medium, more oval soup spoon.
Occasionally, you may be served consommé, served in a small bowl with han-
dles on each side, without a spoon. Pick up the delicate bowl by the handles,
and sip.
All other soups should be handled this way: Hold your spoon the way you
would hold a pencil, between your index and middle fingers, with your thumb
up. Spoon the soup away from you toward the center or top of the bowl, and
then sip the soup from the side — not the point — of the spoon. You may rest
the spoon in the soup bowl (not cup) while you pause. When you have fin-
ished, place the spoon on the saucer or plate beneath the cup or bowl. Don’t
leave the spoon in the bowl or cup.
Blowing on your soup to cool it is not polite. You may gently stir it or spoon
the soup from the edge of the bowl first, or hold your spoon with the soup in
your hand for an extra moment or two. Never add ice from your water glass!
A small glass of sherry is often served, or aperitif may be served with your
soup. It is polite to sip the sherry slowly. It’s not necessary to finish the 
entire glass.

Entree
Your main course normally is beef, chicken, duck, or lamb, and you eat these
foods with a knife and fork. Finger foods, such as fried chicken or barbecued
ribs, are not served at formal occasions.
If you happen to be served a very large steak, in the American style of eating,
you may cut it into two or three sections, but not into many small pieces at
the same time. In the Continental style, you will cut one bite at a time.
Salad
Salad may be served before or after the main course; the placement of 
the salad fork will tip you off. A basic American table setting (which I
describe earlier in this chapter) usually has only one knife. For this reason,
some Americans seem to think that the knife is for the main course and that
they cannot use it for the salad.
A fine restaurant or considerate host always serves the lettuce in bite-size
pieces. If you’re served large pieces, however, cut one bite at a time by using
the knife provided. Using your knife to cut lettuce is perfectly fine; just
request a clean knife when the main course arrives.
If salad is the main course, such as at a luncheon, use the entree fork. If the
salad is served before or after the main course, use the smaller salad fork.
When a salad is served during a formal meal, you always have a salad knife.
Notice that this knife usually is smaller than the dinner knife.
Here’s a trick to eating cherry tomatoes on a salad without making them fly
off the plate: With your fork, pierce the top where the stem was located.
Finger bowl
First place the dessert fork and spoon on the table beside you, to make ready
for the dessert service. Then it will be up to you whether you want to use the
finger bowl at this time or after dessert. If after dessert, you will dip just your
fingertips in the water and dry them on your napkin. Remove the doily and
bowl and place it to the upper-left side of your place setting. After dessert, you
will then bring the finger bowl back to the center to gently dip the fingertips of
one hand and then the other to wash, drying each hand with your napkin. You
will not dip both hands at once as though you are washing your hands from a
basin. The server will then remove it following the dessert.
Dessert
When the main-course plate is removed, you may have a spoon and a fork left
above it. It is your responsibility to move the fork down to your left and the
spoon down to your right. If you do not have silverware above your plate, it
178
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

will be brought to you before dessert. If you’re served ice cream, use just
your spoon; if you’re served cake with a sauce, use both the spoon and the
fork. In a Continental-style setting, you hold your spoon in your right hand
and the fork in your left hand, tines down.
Fresh fruit and cheese sometimes are served either as dessert or before
dessert. You eat these foods with a knife and fork.
Excusing yourself from the meal
If you must leave the table for any reason, rise from your seat, put your napkin
on your chair, and say a simple “Excuse me” as you depart. When you return,
resume your seat without comment.
Don’t announce a visit to the “john” or the powder room, or the need to make
an important phone call.
If an occasion arises in which you must quit the meal permanently before it is
over, make a brief apology, indicate when you will next talk with important
guests or clients, and then leave with as little interruption as possible.
Anyone else leaving the meal temporarily should return and gracefully and
discreetly re-enter the meal and conversation.
Silence your gadgets! If an emergency arises, briefly explain the situation to
the others before excusing yourself: “I regret the interruption, but my wife
has been involved in a traffic accident. I’ll be in contact as soon as I take 
care of the emergency.”
Scoring High Marks for Wine Savvy
Wine enhances food. Like music, wine can be as much a pleasure for the
blissfully ignorant as for the expert. The only danger with wine is knowing
that your knowledge is so limited that you won’t order the right one. Relax!
Nearly everyone is curious about wines, and most people are delighted to 
try new kinds. You can read more about choosing the right wine for your
meal in Mary Ewing-Mulligan and Ed McCarthy’s Wine For Dummies, 4th
Edition (Wiley).
179
Chapter 12: Mastering Dining Etiquette

Selecting a wine to complement your meal
Think of wine as the final seasoning of the dish. Normally, you order red
wines with red meats and other robust dishes, and white wines with fish and
other delicate entrees. Delicate foods usually are better with delicate wines.
But some of these rules are changing. Wine experts sometimes simply drink
what they like. What if you order oven-roasted sea bass served with a veal-
reduction sauce? If a dish has a wine base, such as a Pinot Noir, a buttery
Chardonnay is an excellent choice. Or try to choose an appropriate Pinot
Noir to match the sauce; you will find it a sure hit. If you’re not certain, ask
the waiter to make a suggestion.
Taste, learn, and drink what you enjoy. Personal preference should be the
deciding factor.
Basic wines
Wine and food go together. The key to choosing a wine is finding one that
won’t overpower the food or be overpowered by it. In general, the following
are examples of wines that complement certain foods:
 Light meat dishes (such as pork), poultry, or full-flavored fish (such as
salmon) go well with a red wine such as a light-bodied Pinot Noir or
Burgundy.
 Lighter fish and shellfish dishes are fine with a light-bodied white wine,
such as Chenin Blanc, Sancerre, Pinot Grigio, or German Riesling.
 Lobster or richer fish dishes are complemented by a full-bodied
Chardonnay, Semillion, or Viognier.
 Chicken and pasta can take either red or white wine, depending on the
sauce. A heavy meat sauce will be better complemented by a medium-
bodied red wine, such as a Merlot or Cabernet Franc.
 Stews, roasts, game, duck, and other full-flavored dishes go best with
full-bodied red wines, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, or
Zinfandel.
Sparkling wines
Champagne is for celebrating and normally is served before a meal or with
dessert. But champagne is the ultimate “power beverage” and also can com-
plement appetizers and first courses. Just opening a bottle of champagne
injects zest and signals the importance of the meal and your guests.
Champagne is distinguished by its degree of dryness. Brut is very dry, extra
dry is slightly sweet, sec is medium-sweet, and demi-sec is sweet. Dry cham-
pagne and rose wines are served chilled. Champagne is bottled in various
180
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

sizes of bottles, all but one of which have Biblical names: magnum, jeroboam,
rehoboam, and methuselah. You are unlikely to need more than a magnum,
which holds about 1.5 liters.
Everyone loves hearing the pop when a bottle of champagne is opened, but
you need to open the bottle with a minimum of fanfare to protect your guests
from a flying cork. Holding the bottle at a 45-degree angle from your body,
making sure not to point it toward anyone, follow these steps:
1. With your thumb over the cork, remove the foil and wire hood from
around the cork.
2. Cover the top of the bottle loosely with a clean cotton napkin.
3. With one hand about two thirds of the way down the bottle and the
other over the cork outside the napkin, twist the bottle (not the cork)
while pushing down on the cork.
4. As the cork emerges, continue putting pressure on the cork so that it
makes only a quiet hiss as it’s released from the bottle.
Dessert wines
Dessert wines often go unnoticed or neglected. These rich-flavored sweet
wines go well with desserts of cheese, nuts, and fruit. They’re best served at
cellar temperature — with the exception of champagne, which is served
chilled. Particularly outstanding are sweet Chateau Y’quem, Marsala,
Angelica, Tokay, Malaga, Cream Sherry, Port, and Madeira.
181
Chapter 12: Mastering Dining Etiquette
Holding the glass: Stem or bowl?
Wine is served in clear glasses to show off 
its colors. The type of wine served determines
which glass to use.
 Rhine and white-wine glasses have long,
slender stems so that you can hold the stem
and avoid warming the wine with the heat
from your hand. The bowl of the glass is
smaller than that of a red-wine glass, with a
more fragile look to complement the wine’s
delicate flavor and clear color.
 A red-wine glass has a shorter stem with a
bulbous bowl. The bowl is large to allow the
wine to breathe. Hold the glass close to 
the bowl.
 Sherry and port glasses are small and open,
because these wines are more potent in
aroma, flavor, and alcoholic content.
 Champagne glasses are tall and narrow,
and are designed to emphasize the effer-
vescence and flavor of sparkling wines.
Many restaurants preset the tables with at least
two wine goblets: a long-stemmed glass for
white wines and a tulip-shape glass for ordinary
red wines. When you order wine, the server
leaves the appropriate goblet on the table and
removes the other.

Mastering the ritual of ordering wine
You and your guest have been seated, and you’ve been presented a wine list.
Uh-oh! All those French words! All those grape varieties! All those fancy
descriptions! Now what?
Deciding who selects the wine
In traditional business settings, the official host or hostess navigates the wine
list and orders the wine. If you know that one of the guests is a wine connois-
seur, it is considered gracious or flattering to ask the guest to select the wine;
however, I don’t recommend this if you are on a limited company expense
account. If you are the host and are not especially knowledgeable about wine,
you can ask for suggestions from the wine steward or sommelier. What hap-
pens if your important client makes a comment that one of her favorite wines
is on the list? Say no? Of course not! By all means select her favorite; if it’s
beyond your company budget, you can explain it to your boss later or you
can contribute the difference.
If you conduct business regularly at a favorite restaurant, consider calling
ahead and having the restaurant staff plan a menu and select the wine, or
arrive early to discuss the menu, wine choices, and prices.
Wine adds flair to a meal and communicates to your guests that they are
valued and important associates. The effort you put into wine selection not
only helps you entertain successfully, but also helps you appear confident
and in charge. Do your homework!
Determining how much to spend
If you are a beginning wine drinker, you may want to enlist the help of your
waiter in making a selection. Fine restaurants will have a wine steward, or
sommelier, on hand to assist you.
Have a price range in mind before you order. A sensible guideline is to spend
about as much on a bottle of wine as you spend on one complete dinner. Fine
wines can vary in price from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars, so make
sure that you know what you’re doing if you select an expensive wine.
Most restaurants price their wines by doubling the retail price and adding
$10. The most expensive wine on the wine list isn’t always the most impres-
sive. When looking for value, don’t follow the trends; select lesser-known
varieties or local wines, which normally are priced lower.
A good rule of thumb is to order the second least expensive wine on the wine
list because many times this is the owner’s pick or the wine buyer’s pick.
Upscale restaurant wine buyers normally are careful not to allow the con-
sumer or customer to be ripped off, so the wine price is in line with quality.
But, remember, the price isn’t always a good indicator of the value.
182
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

One bottle of wine contains approximately four glasses. Make sure to request
an adequate number of bottles for the number of guests. If more than four
guests are present, order a second bottle.
Asking what your guests want
Ask whether your guests have any preferences. It’s fine to offer or make sug-
gestions on an apéritif, champagne, or white wine to be served with the first
course.
Also ask your guests about their meal choices. If everyone decides to have a
rich red-meat entree, a red wine would be appropriate. If guests are having
lighter chicken or seafood dishes, suggest a lighter-bodied white wine.
Occasionally, you may have a guest who does not drink red wine. If the major-
ity of your guests prefer red wine, suggest individual glasses of white wine, or
order one bottle of white and one bottle of red for the table.
Red wines normally are served at room temperature, though not the normal
67°F standard but rather cellar temperature, around 55°F to 60°F. White wines
are served chilled so that their flavor and aroma are at their peak. If the
restaurant is hot, a slightly chilled light red wine may be more desirable than
a heavy Cabernet.
Handling the presentation
The server will present the wine to you, as the host or hostess. Now is the time
to examine the label, making certain that it is the correct wine and vintage. If
the wine is acceptable, the next step is for the server to remove the seal, take
out the cork, and place it on the table. Visually examine the cork. You don’t
have to sniff or smell it to tell whether the cork is in good condition. Unless 
the cork bears a different name from the label or is dry and crumbly, you have
nothing to worry about.
In recent years, more wines are using plastic or no corks. Screw tops are
increasingly popular with many wineries throughout the world and are no
reflection on the quality or level of the wine.
A crumbly cork is a sign that air may have leaked into the wine and spoiled it.
The bottle should be replaced with another.
Tasting the wine
The person who orders the wine normally is the taster, although the host may
ask one of the guests to taste instead, if she knows the guest is knowledgeable
and interested in wine. A small amount of wine will be poured into your glass.
Color tells you a lot about the age of the wine, so look carefully before you
taste. Red wines lose their color when aged. The younger the wine, the brighter
the color; the older the wine, the deeper the color and the more concentrated
the flavors. White wines become deeper yellow or gold with age.
183
Chapter 12: Mastering Dining Etiquette

Gently swirl the wine by holding the stem firmly and rotating the bowl. This
motion is a small one, not at all akin to preparing to lasso a steer. Swirling
wine provides it oxygen, which assists in releasing its aroma or nose. Now
sniff. Most of what you need to know about wine, you can determine by its
perfume. If you like, take a small sip. Although you don’t have to swish the
wine through your mouth, you may want to hold the wine in your mouth for 
a moment before swallowing.
Tasting allows you to discover the overall impression of the wine. If the wine
has been spoiled — or, as it is commonly known, corked — you will know that
upon tasting. It will taste terrible, not just strange. If the wine tastes off to
you, don’t hesitate to say so. The waiter or sommelier may also taste it to
confirm. He will then bring another bottle of the same wine. If that vintage 
is not available, the waiter or sommelier will suggest or bring a similar wine.
Establishments do not ask guests to pay for spoiled wine. Fine restaurants
always replace truly spoiled wine without hesitation.
Returning a bottle of wine only because you dislike it is gauche.
Coping with Difficult-to-Eat 
Foods and Unusual Utensils
Some foods are tough to eat without looking too much like an animal gnawing
away at bones or tubers. In the following sections, I offer some advice on how
to eat these difficult foods while maintaining your dignity.
A couple of general tips to begin with: In an informal setting, when you’re
eating fowl of any kind, separate the bird at its major joints. With small ani-
mals such as frogs and game hens, pick up the tiny legs and wings by a pro-
truding bone, and eat the meat as finger food. When you finish, place all
bones to one side of your dinner plate.
Specific foods
The following sections discuss the biggest troublemakers for those of us who
are unsure about dining etiquette.
Japanese soups and noodles
Soups are often served after the appetizer as the first course. The soup should
not be so hot that you have to imbibe quite a bit of air with your sips to avoid
being scalded.
184
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

Noodles are often served so hot that they can’t be eaten in puckered silence.
Open your mouth wide to accommodate the slippery pasta, and suck in with
a fair amount of gusto! For a Westerner, picking up the knack of noodle eating
depends on how quickly you can abandon the American taboo against noisy
eating.
Pitted foods
Olives are finger foods. Large stuffed olives are best eaten in two bites. You
may pick up olives and other foods that have pits with your fingers when they
are on your plate. Discreetly remove pits with your forefinger and thumb.
Shellfish and mollusks
Follow these guidelines for eating shellfish and mollusks:
 Lobster and crab: Whole lobster and crab are almost always served in
informal situations. The host provides bibs. Everyone accepts that a lot
of finger work is forthcoming. When in doubt about the correct method,
ask your host for guidance. If you’re unfamiliar with the procedure for
tackling a whole lobster, and you find yourself confronted by one, the
other guests are likely to have plenty of good advice. Don’t be shy about
asking for suggestions.
 Mussels: Steamed mussels may be eaten with a fork and spoon or a
cocktail fork. Spear the mussel, dip it into the sauce provided, and 
eat it whole. Place the empty shells in the shell bowl.
 Oysters: Oysters are attached to the bottom shell by a slender membrane.
To free the meat from the shell, slip your oyster fork underneath the
meat, and wiggle it back and forth a time or two. If you want, you may
dip it into the sauce on your plate. Eat the oyster in one bite — usually,
more of a swallow. You may pick up the shell with your fingers and drain
the juice directly into your mouth. Try not to slurp.
 Shrimp: If shrimp is served ready to eat in a cocktail appetizer, pierce
the shrimp on a little cocktail fork, and bite off a succession of manage-
able pieces. If the shrimp are large, place them on the plate and cut them
with the provided fork before dipping them into the sauce. Steamed
shrimp served in their shells, however, are definitely finger foods. Before
you tackle a serving of shrimp in their shells, make sure that you have a
large fabric napkin on hand. Ask for a bib if you fear for the safety of
your shirt or blouse. Usually, a large bowl is provided for the empty
shells; otherwise, pile them neatly on your plate.
 Snails (escargot): If the escargot is served in the shell, tongs to hold the
shell will be provided. Use the escargot tong to secure the snail, pick up
one escargot shell at a time, and remove the snail from the shell with
your cocktail fork. Dip the snail into the butter sauce provided. Many
restaurants serve escargot already removed from the shell and placed 
in special dishes with sauce or melted butter.
185
Chapter 12: Mastering Dining Etiquette

Spaghetti
It may look difficult, but eating spaghetti is easy: Spaghetti is normally twirled
on the edge of your plate with your fork and secured with your knife before
bringing the bite to your mouth to eat. However, a fork and a place spoon
may also be used (though you rarely see this method in most of Italy. It is pri-
marily used in Southern Italy, as in Sicily). The place spoon serves as a base
of operation. Place a forkful of spaghetti strands — not too many — in the
bowl of the place spoon. Then twirl the fork around until the strands are
firmly wrapped around the fork in a bite-size portion.
Using chopsticks
In many Asian countries, chopsticks are used instead of the Western knife,
fork, and spoon. Chopsticks come in a wide variety of finishes, from plain
wood to ornately decorated lacquer.
Using chopsticks involves a certain technique. Hold them between your
index finger and thumb, with the lower stick resting in the web of your hand
and the top stick being held like a pencil (see Figure 12-9). The top stick does
most of the moving. Use your two middle fingers to maneuver it. Holding
chopsticks too tightly restricts mobility; holding them too close to the tip
makes you lose leverage.
If your food is too big for a single bite, you may use your chopsticks to cut it
or you may hold the food with your chopsticks while you take a couple of
bites. Between bites, either place your chopsticks on the rest provided or 
lay them diagonally across the lower dish or plate.
Here is a brief list of chopstick don’ts:
 Never point, gesture, or talk with chopsticks.
 Do not leave chopsticks pointed upright in your rice or soup bowl.
 Do not pick through the common food plate to find your favorite
piece; select it visually and then help yourself.
 Never take food from another person’s chopsticks.
Figure 12-9:
Holding 
and using
chopsticks.
186
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

And remember — if you’re not ready to tackle chopsticks, it is perfectly fine
to request a fork and knife if you are in the United States. When traveling 
to Asian countries, it’s good to take time to learn to use chopsticks
(properly) ahead of time. In most traditional restaurants, they won’t have
forks, though many of the newer restaurants and hotels in large cities will
provide a fork if requested.
Managing Dining Mishaps
Eating in any social setting may result in mishaps. The following tips may
help you steer yourself out of common mishaps that can occur:
 You drop a utensil on the floor. Never lean over and pick up the utensil.
Beckon a waiter, and politely ask for a new one.
 You’re served a piece of food that is not cooked properly. Do you send
it back or live with it? Depending on the time allocated and the type of
meal you are attending, business lunch or dinner, it may be best to say
nothing and just eat it. If you choose to send it back, be aware of the
delays you may cause to the overall meal. Let the server know by dis-
creetly explaining the situation, and remember to keep your voice low.
Trust the server to reappear with a different plate of food for you.
 You find a foreign object in your food. Again, find a waiter, and tell her
about the problem in a very discreet manner. Rest assured that your
meal will be replaced quickly.
 You dislike the food that is being served, or you are allergic to it. The
polite thing to do is try a little of everything, but if you are allergic to a
food, just smile and say, “No, thank you.” It’s not necessary to say any-
thing critical.
 You have a piece of bone, gristle, or some other unwanted food item
in your mouth. Discreetly place the item on the tines of your fork and
lay it on your plate, hiding it under something if possible.
 You notice that your dining partner has spinach in her teeth or a
crumb in his beard. Catch your dining partner’s attention, and dis-
creetly motion to that part of your face where the offending morsel 
is lodged on his or her face.
If you have a mishap, always be discreet and apologetic — use a little light
humor to keep the mood upbeat.

Chapter 13
Attending Conferences, Trade
Shows, and Special Events
In This Chapter
 Remembering that you represent your company
 Mingling at social events
 Being social after hours
 Planning or attending a special event
M
ost people end up attending work-related special events at least once in
a while. Depending on your perspective, these events are enlightening
and energizing, or they’re a big fat bore. Regardless of how you feel about these
events, certain guidelines exist for how to act when you’re at one of them.
In this chapter, I show you how to be a good company representative, how to
mingle at conferences and conventions, and how to avoid embarrassing your-
self after hours. I also explain how to plan and participate in a special event
for your company.
Being a Stellar Representative 
of Your Company
It may not be fair, but it’s true: When you’re at a conference or a trade show,
your actions are not completely your own. If you are an employee of Big Fish
Corp., the people you meet will see you as a Big Fish representative, even if
you see yourself as a guppy. Make sure you conduct yourself in a way that’s
fair to the people who sign your paycheck.
Perhaps your most important responsibility is to avoid making negative com-
ments about your company. You don’t have to lie, but you shouldn’t slander
your employer either. Even if you hate your job or think that the company 
is mismanaged, it’s not your place to say so in this environment. Politely

change the subject. If someone says something like “I had a friend who
worked for XYZ Co., and he says the CEO spent all the company’s money on
exotic sharks for his personal pool,” you could respond, “Hmm. I haven’t
heard that. Did you say you work for Mega Technology? I’ve heard lots of
interesting things about your new product. Is it really going to revolutionize
the frozen-burrito industry?”
Come up with a few stock answers for questions about your company —
explanations of what the company does (if this question is common), positive
comments about the new CEO, or information about new products.
Obviously, you should never reveal any kind of confidential information about
your company. If you’re not sure whether something is a secret, assume that 
it is. What you’re saying may not seem to be especially important, and the
person you’re talking to may seem to be inconsequential, but you can never
be sure. You should discuss interesting and exciting news that’s public infor-
mation, however. Making comments about how much you like working for
your company or making other positive comments is always appropriate.
Your behavior at mealtimes, during meetings, and after hours also reflects on
your company. To be a good representative, follow the other rules you find
throughout this book.
Schmoozing and Networking
Industry events such as conferences and trade shows are great places to
make contacts in your field and to find out more about what’s going on at
other companies. In fact, your company may be paying your way to the event
in part so that you will learn more about your industry. If you’re naturally
confident and outgoing, the social aspects of work probably aren’t that diffi-
cult for you. But if you’re a little shy (or a lot), the idea of navigating a room
full of new faces may be terrifying. Instead of hiding in your room watching
HBO, take a deep breath, and try these strategies.
First of all, slap on a name tag. These events almost always provide them, and
they make you more approachable. The name tag should go on your right
shoulder, the idea being that when you shake hands, the other person’s eyes
will be drawn up your arm to your name tag. If the tags are the self-adhesive
kind, and you’re concerned about damaging a silk blouse, ask whether any
clip-on holders are available. Better yet, try to remember this problem when
you’re packing, and bring something a little sturdier.
Next, you should establish some goals for yourself. If you’re in sales, your goal
might be to gather as many business cards and sales leads as possible. If this
conference is your first, your goal might be simply to practice introducing
yourself. If you don’t have a specific need to meet people, your goal might be
to have a good time and sample the shrimp toast.
190
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

If introducing yourself to a stranger is daunting, keep in mind that saying
hello and telling someone your name are not major commitments. For 
some people, speaking to a stranger is as scary as asking for a first date. It
shouldn’t be. All the people in the room have at least something in common
with you: They don’t know many people either, they’re a little nervous, and
they’re not sure what to say. They will be very grateful if you break the ice by
starting the conversation. All you have to do is extend your hand and say
“Hello, I’m Johan Otto.” This introduction will prompt the other person to
respond with his name. Then you can say “What did you think of today’s
speaker?” or “What company do you work for?” or even “How’s the artichoke
dip?” What you say doesn’t have to be something profoundly interesting; it
just has to be something. The other person responds, and then you’re off.
Unless you’re attending a convention of Nobel laureates, no one is expecting
you to be outrageously witty or wise — just friendly.
If someone approaches you and starts the conversation, good for you! Smile
and be pleasant. Share some information about yourself and ask questions in
return. If you have a business card, hand it out. You’re doing great!
Now it’s time to remember your goal. If you’re trying to meet the maximum
number of people, stay on task. Although you want to be polite, you don’t
want to spend too much time with any one person. After you’ve chatted with
someone for a few minutes and learned a little bit about her, it’s all right for
you to move on. You can say something as simple as “Mary, it’s been nice get-
ting to know you,” hand her your business card, and ask whether she has a
card. If it makes you feel more comfortable, you can make up some small
excuse, such as “I really wanted to make sure I met this afternoon’s speaker,
and I see him over there.” Making excuses really isn’t necessary, though; you
don’t need to apologize for wanting to meet a variety of people at the event.
If you’re not concerned about making lots of contacts, you can be a bit more
relaxed. An interesting conversation could last all night, or you can end a
boring one and move on.
Whatever you do, avoid the temptation to look around the room while you’re
talking to someone. This can be difficult at a busy party, because so much
movement is going on — like sitting at a sports bar and trying not to watch
the hockey game. You have to discipline yourself, though. Seeing your eyes
darting around the room is very disconcerting for the other person.
If you have a friend or a colleague at the event, you may want to buddy up,
provided that you don’t talk only to each other. When you’re introducing
yourself to someone, introduce your friend at the same time. What you
shouldn’t do is stand together in the corner like cellmates looking out at 
the world. You’re there to meet new people and expand your boundaries.
Flip to Chapter 5 for more details about the art of meeting and greeting.
Chapter 6 has the goods on making polite conversation.

Chapter 13: Attending Conferences, Trade Shows, and Special Events

Socializing after Hours
Whether you’re at an industry conference or at a meeting that’s only for your
company’s employees, work lasts for only so long. In many cases, you’re on
your own in the evenings. You may want to use this opportunity to get to
know the people you work with — or want to work with — a little better.
Deciding whether to socialize
Before you get down to serious socializing, you should decide whether you
want to attend any social event at all. How should you decide?
 If your boss or another influential person asks you out to dinner, don’t
say no, even if you have a stack of work and a big headache. Although
such opportunities are not strictly part of the work day, they’re an
important part of your career. Even if the invitation is from a peer, you
usually should accept. If you routinely turn down opportunities to
socialize with your colleagues, you risk getting a reputation for being
aloof or not a team player.
 On the other hand, if you’re craving an evening alone, you may not make
a very good dinner companion. Particularly on long trips when you’re
working long days, you may be tired, cranky, and overwhelmed with
work. On those occasions, it’s all right to tell colleagues, “I’m really not
up to dinner this evening; I’m planning to get some work done and turn
in early.” Politely stick to your guns if they try to change your mind. You
have every right to use your evening the way you want to.
A busy executive for a telecommunications company travels frequently,
and he almost always has dinner with colleagues. He’s learned to recog-
nize his own limits, however, and sometimes lets others know that he’s
going to slam and click: shut his hotel-room door, click the lock shut, and
open it for no one but room service! As long as you don’t use it too often,
the slam and click can be a great strategy for renewing your energy.
Sticking to a few simple rules
So you’ve decided to go out with some colleagues after work. Great! 
When dining with colleagues, you should follow the standard rules for busi-
ness dining outlined in Chapter 11. Here are a few additional guidelines for
socializing after hours:
192
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

 When you’re with people from work, the conversation often drifts toward
office gossip. Watch your step, keep your own comments to a minimum,
and resist the temptation to say anything vicious or untrue. Although you
may be forced to respond to a question like “Is it true that you heard Sam
getting chewed out because he messed up on the IPO?”, avoid wallowing
in your own contempt for Sam and his incompetence. Just say something
like this: “I heard that he and Sue had a big talk about the offering, but
other than that, I don’t really know what happened.” Your colleagues may
be disappointed if they can’t get some good gossip, but that’s their prob-
lem, not yours.
 If you’re with your boss or some other senior person, you should follow
that person’s lead in ordering. If he orders an appetizer and an addi-
tional side dish, you should too. Keep courses balanced so that every-
one is eating at the same time.
 Although you can always drink less than the senior person, you should
not drink more. Two or three glasses of wine during a business dinner
are plenty for almost everyone. (It isn’t even necessary for you to drink
to make your clients comfortable, as long as your behavior in no way
suggests disapproval of their drinking.)
Be careful! Getting drunk in front of your colleagues will make you look
pathetic and out of control, not fun and sophisticated. Know your limit,
and stay well under it. If you’re having drinks at cocktail hour or later in
the evening, drink slowly, and have at least one glass of water for each
alcoholic drink. When you’re drinking wine or beer with dinner, savor it
slowly. If you feel even close to woozy, stop drinking, and keep eating.
 In addition to keeping your conversation under control, staying sober
can keep you from doing things you will regret back at the office. Even 
if you haven’t had a thing to drink, however, being out of town can make
you feel that a liaison with that attractive coworker isn’t so far out of
reach. Resist, resist, resist! You shouldn’t do anything out of town that
you wouldn’t do back at home. Why?
• If your colleague isn’t interested in your advances, you may find
yourself facing a sexual-harassment claim or, at the very least, an
awkward situation.
• Keep in mind that you have to work with this person for the fore-
seeable future.
• Stories about your after-hours activities may — and probably will —
find their way back to the office gossip, and possibly to your boss 
or members of your family. Even if you think you’re being very 
discreet, you may well be the subject of next week’s nudges and
smirks.
Questionable behavior with consenting adults from other companies
may be slightly less risky, but not much less.

Chapter 13: Attending Conferences, Trade Shows, and Special Events

Planning and Participating 
in Special Events
Myriad reasons exist for having special events in the business world —
boosting employee morale, celebrating company successes, recognizing
employees, entertaining and impressing clients, launching new products, and
many more. When you’re on the planning end of these events, you play a key
role in their success. Even as a participant, you are an important part of the
proceedings. The following sections give you some guidelines for each role.
When you’re the planner
Planning special events is such a huge task that some people make a career
of it. A few simple tips, however, go a long way toward helping you plan a 
successful event.
Begin planning as far in advance as possible
Start as far in advance as you can. In many cases, you don’t have much con-
trol of the schedule — many an executive has said something like “I’d like to
take our top ten clients ice fishing in Alaska two weeks from Saturday; get 
on that, won’t you?” — but you should control it as much as you can. If you
know that an event is coming up and that you will be in charge of organizing
it, get as much information as possible right away. What’s the purpose of the
event? Approximately how many people will be there — 50 or 5,000? Will it be
casual or formal? Where will it take place? Is a budget allocated? Take a cue
from the experts: Planning for some huge events, such as the Olympics,
begins years in advance.
If someone is reluctant to discuss the event with you because he doesn’t
have all the facts yet, explain to him that you will get started with whatever
facts are available now. The earlier you begin planning, the greater chance 
of success you have.
Get organized with detailed to-do lists
Be as organized as possible. You can’t put together a successful event by
keeping everything in your head and on those tiny sticky notes. Professional
event planners are known for their extensive, detailed to-do lists and ubiqui-
tous clipboards. Many professionals start a project by putting together a
huge list of every single thing they can think of that will need to be done.
From that list, they develop the following:
 A timeline, working backward from the event: The timeline includes a
list of tasks from booking the location (months in advance) to sending
out invitations (weeks in advance) to having fresh flowers delivered (the
194
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

morning of the event). The timeline must include reminders to get the
necessary approvals — everything from your fireworks permit from 
the city to your boss’s okay on the menu.
 A list of assignments: With any luck, you’ll be able to find someone to
pick up the keynote speaker from the airport while you’re busy cutting
10,000 egg-salad sandwiches into the shape of the company logo.
 A list of the vendors needed: Even if you don’t know right away who
these vendors will be, such as caterers, limousine services, travel agents,
sound-system experts, florists, belly dancers, and balloon-animal techni-
cians, you should make sure that you have all the categories in mind.
 A list of contingencies: What if extra attendees show up? What if the
speaker is late? What if it rains?
Share your big list of things to do with at least one other person, who will act
as your backup if needed. And have a list of contact people at the various 
service-providing organizations, including notes about what’s been arranged
with each of them. As the event gets closer, you may want to review this 
list with your backup, or at least send it to him, on a weekly or even daily
basis. Most events require lots of last-minute preparation and on-site manage-
ment. If you wake up with a debilitating rash on the day of the event, your
backup will appreciate having this list.
Think through every aspect of the event
Walk through the entire event in your mind, and if possible, walk through it
physically. How long does it take you to walk slowly from the conference
room to the gazebo? Take that figure and multiply it by four; that’s how long
herding your guests will take.
A new employee at a large company thought he had planned for everything —
prompt airport pickups, vegetarian meals for those who didn’t want Iowa
beef, fresh flowers on every table, and welcome letters in each room. What
he didn’t plan for was a huge speaker’s event in the room next door. For his
next event, he added “Check on other events in hotel” to his big list.
You dramatically increase your chances of pulling off a successful event if you
take into account that people will act the way they want to, not the way 
you want them to. Most people cannot sit still for three hours without a
break, for example. If you plan a meeting without sufficient break time, you
can be assured that it will be interrupted by a steady stream of participants
leaving to smoke, powder their noses, and make phone calls. Many others
will not eat certain foods — especially red meat — so you should always offer
at least one vegetarian choice. Most people also refuse to wear bathing suits,
sing, or do the limbo in front of coworkers.
195
Chapter 13: Attending Conferences, Trade Shows, and Special Events

When you’re an attendee
When you’re a guest in someone else’s home, you’re probably gracious and
polite by instinct. Your instincts at a special event should be no different.
Even in a hotel ballroom or in the middle of a wheat field, you’re someone’s
guest, and your behavior is important.
 Be on time. If the event starts at a certain time, you don’t want to be the
one walking in late and disrupting the speaker. Be sure to allow time for
getting a name tag and finding a seat, as well as for regular concerns like
traffic and parking.
 Do what’s asked of you. If a chair is marked “reserved,” don’t sit in it. If
someone asks you to move into the dining room, don’t keep standing
right where you are. Even if you’re used to being in charge, take this
opportunity to see how the other half lives.
 Stay seated, pay attention, and remain quiet. If the event involves a
meeting or a sit-down program, sit down, and do your best to pay atten-
tion. Turn off your pager and cell phone, just as you would during a busi-
ness meeting or meal, and refrain from jumping up to make calls. You
should also avoid talking during the presentation. Talking is distracting
to the speaker and to those around you. (These rules go for outdoor
concerts, too.)
 Be polite to the staff. If you have a problem that can be fixed, mention it
politely to your server. A knife, if you didn’t get one, and refills of coffee
should be easy. Some food-related requests, however, just don’t make
sense at a banquet. Your server probably won’t be able to correct an
overcooked steak while taking care of 79 other guests in a fixed period.
Accept that fact, and give thanks that you don’t have to eat in a hotel
ballroom every night of the week. Likewise, ask the buffet attendant
whether more shrimp will be coming out, but don’t complain to him; 
he can’t do a thing about it.
 If you’re at an outdoor event, don’t leave your manners inside. Paper
plates and napkins belong in the trash can, not on the ground. Your
mouth should be firmly closed while chewing, even if you’re eating corn
on the cob and fried chicken with your fingers. Casual dress doesn’t
mean frayed, see-through, or tight clothing — at least, not at a business
function. When you’re back in the office next week, you don’t want your
colleagues contemplating the image of you in a Metallica T-shirt with the
arms cut off.
Unless you’ve been given very special treatment of some kind, thank-you
notes usually are not required for business special events. A nice note to the
host and/or event planner, however, will be treasured for a long time and is
preferable to an e-mail. See Chapter 8 for details on thank-you notes and
other types of business correspondence.
196
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

When you’re part of the action
If you’re an important part of the special event — a speaker, entertainer, or
guest of honor — congratulations! You’ve obviously earned the respect and
admiration of your hosts. By following a few simple rules, you can be sure
that they will still respect and admire you after you leave:
 Try not to be extraordinarily high-maintenance. Asking your hosts 
to pick you up at the airport — which they probably will offer to do
anyway — is well within bounds. Asking them to pick you up, drop you
off for an afternoon of skydiving 40 miles in the opposite direction, and
then pick you up again later is out of bounds. If you want to combine 
the event with other personal business or pleasure activities, offer to
arrange your own transportation. If your hosts are in a position to assist
you, they will offer to do so.
 When traveling long distances for an engagement, plan extra time for
travel delays. If allowing extra time leaves you with an extra half-day of
down time, ask your hosts to help you out with finding temporary office
space, setting up a videoconference room, or getting whatever you may
need. They would much rather do that than have you arrive after the
event because of a weather delay.
 Don’t commit to an engagement unless you’re sure you can make it,
and don’t cancel unless circumstances make it absolutely unavoidable.
A parent’s sudden hospitalization is a reason to cancel; a golf game with
an old buddy at a really great course is not. Canceling plans because you
got a better offer is never polite, but it’s especially impolite when hun-
dreds of people have arranged their schedules to hear you speak.
 If you have a problem with your accommodations, speak up, but know
when to quit. It’s one thing to call the front desk of your hotel and com-
plain about the temperature, cleanliness, or smokiness of your room. It’s
another thing to rant at your host about the inferior quality of the hotel
he chose. At that point, it may be too late for him to do anything about
it, and he’ll only feel guilty (or annoyed). After the event is over, and his
stress level has receded, you could follow up with a polite note to let
him know that a different hotel might be a better choice for the next
speaker.
 Don’t be the boring presenter everyone talks about for years to come.
If you’ve agreed to be the keynote speaker, you’ve agreed to do your
very best work onstage. This rule may seem to be elementary, but it’s
important: Prepare for your presentation! If you’re the main event, your
audience expects an interesting, articulate, and enlightening presenta-
tion. Unless you are extremely good on your feet — and most people
aren’t — don’t plan to get on stage and wing it. Outline your presenta-
tion, and practice it as many times as necessary to make it shine. In
addition, having an outline may make it possible for a colleague to make
your presentation in case of an emergency.
197
Chapter 13: Attending Conferences, Trade Shows, and Special Events

When attending a trade show or convention, be sure to bring along three
times the number of business cards than you normally would take. You can
always take home what you do not use; it’s better to have too many than too
few. You don’t want to miss out on winning that special prize or not having a
business card for that VIP.

Social Off-Site Activities
In This Chapter
 Hosting business outings
 Going over special etiquette for a variety of sports
 Covering your bases at sporting and cultural events
W
ith the new flexibility in the workday, business isn’t restricted to the
office or the restaurant anymore. The contemporary world has as
many venues for business as it does activities that colleagues and associates
can share. Whether you and your best client are avid ice climbers or fanatical
golfers, at some point in your career you’re likely to find yourself in a situa-
tion in which you never thought you’d be doing business.
In this chapter, you get advice on some of the most common out-of-the-office
venues for business. Your list might include paragliding or heli-skiing in
Bugaboo State Park. But take heart: At least for now, trips to Mount Everest
are not de rigueur.
Hosting Group Outings
Just as the workday is more flexible than it used to be, so are the places
where you can conduct business. You may work for an engineering firm that
encourages employees to take after-lunch group bike rides to the city over-
look. Your boss may like to take small groups to her house so that you can
discuss strategy in the privacy of her backyard. You may visit a high-tech
firm in Portland and be invited on a walking tour of Horsetail Falls in the
Gorge. Come prepared with the appropriate clothing if at all possible.
If you’re the host of an off-site outing, take care to think things through ahead
of time. Schedule off-site outings at least two weeks in advance and notify the
guests of the plans. In the invitation, clearly state the equipment needed (if
any), as well as the purpose and length of the outing. Unless you provide

ample warning, respect people’s right to decline if the outing radically devi-
ates from the time and place of the regular workday. That way, an employee
won’t be stranded on a granite face 10 minutes before she needs to pick her
daughter up at day care.
Also take the time to learn about any other personal or practical impedi-
ments to the off-site outing. Perhaps your guest is asthmatic, and the trip
you’d hoped to take to the sea lions’ caves would only make her miserable.
Perhaps reservations have to be made months in advance for that ferry ride
across Puget Sound; if you show up without reservations, you’ll embarrass
both yourself and your guest. Whatever the event is, think things through,
and always consider the weather.
If you are hosting a guest from out of town and want to take him to see some
of the local sights and landmarks, discreetly inquire as to his willingness to
undertake such an excursion. Say something like this: “Mr. Ferrari, I would
like to offer you the opportunity to see our wonderful art museum and the
local arboretum tomorrow. Would that be of interest to you, or is there some-
thing else you would prefer?” If Ferrari has some restrictions that would pre-
vent him from enjoying walking, this phrasing of the question allows him to
back away gracefully. It prevents embarrassment to you as well, because the
way you’ve phrased the question doesn’t put your guest in the position of
having to admit that he’d rather not join you for reasons he’d rather not
reveal.
Avoid planning strenuous outings unless your guest is a health nut. There’s
no point in jeopardizing a business relationship by possibly humiliating 
your guest.
Displaying Good Manners, 
No Matter the Sport
Civility is fundamental and essential to survival, because it preserves our
basic human values. Lately, this ideal has been challenged in sports, with the
debasement of the traditional values of good sportsmanship. Almost every
week, you see TV and newspaper reports about both players and spectators
yelling, using vulgar language, and engaging in physical altercations.
Yes, losing is disappointing, and most people don’t like it. But we can all find
ways to control our behavior in reaction to a loss. Players and spectators
alike should practice these basic guidelines:
 Even if you lose, don’t make excuses or walk away angry; be a good sport,
smile, and hold your head high. No one likes a whiner or complainer.
 Treat your opponent(s) respectfully, and always try to avoid arguments.
200
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

 Accept judgment calls from the officials, and follow their directions.
 Abide by the rules of the game. Play fair.
 Offer encouragement to teammates; never criticize them if they make a
mistake.
 Play your best without showing off.
 Win without bragging or gloating.
 Never throw anything in anger. In addition to being rude and childish,
this behavior could be dangerous.
In the following sections, I discuss the etiquette of a variety of sports that
you may engage in during your career.
Admitting that you don’t play a sport you’ve been invited to play is perfectly
all right. Rank beginners and fakes aren’t appreciated. It’s better to decline
than to embarrass yourself in a sport you don’t know how to play at least
passably well.
Golfing
Golf and business are like hot dogs and baseball: They naturally go together.
The relaxed pace, bucolic surroundings, and handsome appointments of the
clubhouse provide an elegant way to get to know other people and to strike
deals.
Golf works well as an icebreaker and deal-maker only some of the time, of
course. The game is immensely frustrating on occasion, so it’s a remarkably
accurate test of a person’s stress-management abilities. If your partner 
doesn’t lose her cool after a quadruple bogey on the par-3 fifteenth hole,
chances are good that she’ll be cool under other kinds of fire.
201
Chapter 14: Taking Part in a Variety of Social Off-Site Activities
Combining cruises and business meetings
An increasingly popular place for off-site meet-
ings is — believe it or not — the cruise ship.
More than just conventions and trade shows
happen on board; day cruises from major and
minor ports and river cities for business meet-
ings are at an all-time high.
The reasons for the newfound popularity of busi-
ness cruises aren’t hard to find. Unlike hotels and
convention centers, cruise ships provide few dis-
tractions. Also, managers find that business
meetings held on board are focused and effi-
cient, and everyone has a good time to boot (at
least, as long as the weather is good).

As old as the game is, golf is loaded with expected behavior and attire. Except
on public courses, you rarely see jeans on a golf course, for example. About
as casual as things get is business casual.
When you’re golfing, keep in mind two codes of conduct: the etiquette of golf-
ing and the etiquette of combining golf and business.
General golf etiquette
When you golf, you should know that:
 Women wear knee-length skirts or long shorts or pants, shirts with col-
lars and sleeves, and golf shoes with soft spikes.
 Men wear slacks or long shorts, shirts with collars and sleeves, and golf
shoes with soft spikes.
 Colors never found in nature or in the office are acceptable on the golf
course. Some clubs favor more muted, conservative attire, however. 
If you’re in doubt, call the club and ask.
 Don’t talk when someone else is playing a stroke.
 Be ready to play when it’s your turn.
 The player with the lowest score on the preceding hole is first to tee off
on the next hole.
 Everyone in your group should be behind you when you hit.
 Let faster groups play through.
 If alcohol is allowed on the course, go easy! Drinking too much while
playing golf with clients is as dangerous as it is at any other company
function.
 Take your practice swings before you get to the tee.
 Repair divots and pitch marks, and rake away your footprints in sand
traps.
 Avoid offering bets, but accept them if they’re offered by your client or
boss. Win graciously, and pay promptly if you lose.
 Don’t cheat on your scorecard.
 In general, the host tips, but if you have a personal caddie, you may tip
your caddie even as a guest.
 Keep your off-color jokes to yourself, as you would at the office. (See
Chapter 2 for more about general office etiquette.)
 Don’t stand with your group on the green after you’ve all holed out.
“Holed out” means that everyone has finished their putt. Move off the
green so the next group can continue to play. You don’t want the players
behind you waiting around unnecessarily.
202
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

 If the golf cart is suppose to hold two people, put no more than two
people in the cart and drive it slowly, keeping it on the cart path and 
off the green unless you have special needs and have made special
arrangements.
 Never, ever scream obscenities or throw your clubs.
Business golf etiquette
Putting golf and business together is supposed to be fun and productive at
the same time. You can achieve both goals more effectively if you remember
that the golf outing is first and foremost a business event and that your boss
and clients have to look good if you’re going to get what you want. Keep
these tips in mind:
 Don’t outplay the boss or client, even if he’s a 15 handicap and you’re a 4.
 Avoid talking business until the group members are settled into the
game and are comfortable with one another.
 Avoid talking business if a companion is facing a difficult shot.
Playing tennis, racquetball, and squash
Racquet sports are popular in large cities because they happen inside and
don’t require a lot of space. A dress code usually is involved. Make sure that
you know ahead of time what the dress code is for the club you are going to
attend.
White is always appropriate at a racquet club, so you will be dressed cor-
rectly if you wear a white knit shirt with a collar and sleeves tucked into
white shorts. Women may also wear tennis dresses. Tennis shoes are the
appropriate footwear. Some clubs’ dress codes are less restrictive than
others. When in doubt, check with the club.
If you’re hosting a client at your club, be sure to arrive early so that your guest
will not face quizzical looks from the staff. Escort your guest to the locker
room, supply her with towels and a locker, and allow her some privacy for
changing.
When you’re the guest, you should arrive with the right gear and the appro-
priate attire. Bring your own racquet, balls, and protective eyewear, and
check ahead about the club’s dress code.
John McEnroe notwithstanding, racquet sports are known for genteel play.
And with the exception of professional or refereed competition matches, 
203
Chapter 14: Taking Part in a Variety of Social Off-Site Activities

racquet sports rely entirely on the honesty of the players to enforce the
rules. This feature requires you to observe the following codes of conduct:
 Show up on time.
 Call out-of-bounds shots on your side of the net.
 Don’t return serves that are out.
 Say nothing if your opponent makes a lousy call.
 Announce the score after every point when you’re serving.
 Return stray balls from other courts when you have a break in your
game.
 Stay in your court, and don’t interrupt other players while they’re play-
ing; wait for a break in their game.
 Never, ever scream obscenities or throw your racquet.
Although playing someone at your own skill level is fun, you will not always
have this luxury. If you are playing with someone at a different level, try to
make the game enjoyable for your guest. If you’re a beginner and your guest
is an accomplished player, let him know your status, and ask for advice. On
the other hand, if you’re an experienced player and your guest is not, don’t
destroy her in the game. Be encouraging. Remember, the point is to have fun.
Sailing and motorboating
Sailing and motorboating can be opportunities for the boss or client to show
off his latest toys. They can also be enormous fun, so long as you know what
you’re doing on the boat:
 Never call a yacht a yacht! All boats, from the smallest motorboat to the
largest yacht, are simply boats to their captains.
 Becoming proficient at sailing takes years of practice, and if you are a
novice, no amount of confident bluster will cover for your ignorance of
the difference between a line and a halyard. Faking it simply isn’t in your
strategic interest; admit your landlubber status, and ask for directions.
Most captains will be more than willing to tell you what to do.
 If the captain asks you to stay put and stop helping, stop helping.
Uninformed “helping” on a sailboat can result in an unintended swim.
 If you’re the host of a day at sea, advise your guests ahead of time about
what they should wear and whether they’re likely to get wet. Let them
know whether they will be sailing, motoring leisurely, or attempting to
break the sound barrier.
 Don’t invite more people than your boat can accommodate.
204
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

 If you’re a guest, remember that the boat is your captain’s. The captain
is boss at all times on the boat, which is not a democracy. Follow 
directions.
If your work will involve frequent sailing or boating expeditions and you grew
up in Nebraska or some other landlocked area, familiarize yourself with the
terms by browsing through an introductory handbook on sailing or boating
(such as Sailing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, written by J. J. Isler and Peter Isler,
and published by Wiley).
Here are some other guidelines to know:
 Wear clothes that will protect you from the elements and can get wet.
Layer! If the weather is reasonably warm, wear a bathing suit, shorts, 
T-shirt or polo shirt, a hat, and sunglasses. Bring a windbreaker and a
sweater or sweatshirt if you will be out in the evening or out on the
ocean. You may take most of your clothes off, but having the right kind
of clothes on hand can help if the weather goes bad or you’re out after
dark.
 Wear deck shoes or simple tennis shoes. Sandals, hiking shoes, or
leather-soled shoes are inappropriate and sometimes dangerous.
 Never smoke below deck; ask if you may smoke above deck.
 Bring only gifts that can be shared while you’re on board. If you’re not
sure about the galley facilities, ask.
 If you fear that you’ll be seasick, take medication along. If you are very
prone to motion sickness, it’s better to decline the invitation.
Skiing and snowboarding
The rules of skiing and snowboarding are, like many other etiquette guide-
lines, based on safety — yours and that of others. Begin by acknowledging
that skiing happens in winter and requires warm clothing. You have to be 
outfitted properly to enjoy skiing. Necessary clothing items include thermal
underclothes, pile shirts and sweaters, wool/nylon-blend socks, moisture-
wicking pants, breathable waterproof parkas and ski pants, gloves or mittens,
and a hat. Sunglasses or goggles (or both) and sunscreen are also necessary.
Skiing and boarding may look easy, but they aren’t. (Ask any orthopedic sur-
geon!) If you’ve never been on skis or a snowboard, counting on your natural
athletic ability to get you down the slope isn’t smart. Do the sensible thing,
and take a lesson or two. With parabolic skis now being the norm for recre-
ational skiers, learning to ski is easier than ever before. The same goes for
boarding.
205
Chapter 14: Taking Part in a Variety of Social Off-Site Activities

If you’re a skier or a boarder, you already know the etiquette rules. If you’re a
beginner, memorize the following:
 Don’t crash the lift line. Stay in order. Offer to ride with singles, or offer
to share a ride with a single.
 If you’ve never been on a lift, tell the operator at the bottom of the lift,
who will slow it and show you how to get on.
 If you’ve never gotten off a lift, motion to the operator at the top to slow
it so you can get off. Then move away from the off ramp immediately.
 Ski and board under control at all times. Skiing and snowboarding can be
lethal sports.
 Don’t go on runs you’re not prepared to go all the way down under your
own power.
 The skier or boarder below you has the right of way at all times. If you
want to pass, yell “Left!” or “Right!” before you do so.
 If you get in over your head on a slope, side-slip down the edge of the
slope to safer ground.
As a skiing host, be aware of your guests’ abilities. Don’t cajole them onto a
double black diamond run to impress them with your skill. Always be prepared
to ski well below your level to ensure the comfort and safety of all your guests.
Again, remember the point is to have fun. You’re not at the Winter Olympics.
Hosting social sporting events for business can be beneficial for your career
and company. If done properly, these occasions can make a positive and last-
ing impression. With good planning and a bit of practice, you will shine as a
gracious company representative — all while actually having fun! Remember,
the goal is to build client and customer relationships, trust, and a rapport. To
accomplish this, it isn’t always necessary to discuss business.
Participating in extreme sports
The etiquette of extreme sports is more than that of most other sports, due
to safety concerns. After all, a significant risk of injury or death is attached to
extreme sports. Your strict adherence to the sport’s etiquette may well save
your life and almost assuredly will save you from injury. Your knowledge of
specific safety concerns will help you enjoy the sport more and make it an
effective social activity for business.
Each extreme sport has its own set of etiquette guidelines. I won’t cover them
here. But I can say that the key business-etiquette issue is, again, to take care
not to outdo your guest or boss. If you and your guests are both kayakers,
but your guest is capable of handling only Grade IV water and you can
206
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

manage Grade VI, either don’t take her on a river with Grade VI water, or con-
firm that the Grade V and VI rapids can be portaged. Your guest may be
humiliated if she tries to run water she can’t run, and she may even get 
seriously injured.
It is always advisable for the host to introduce the etiquette of a particular
sport to his guests. And if you’re uncertain as a guest, don’t hesitate to ask.
(If you doubt this advice, read Into Thin Air, by Jon Krakauer. Need I say
more?)
Attending Sporting and Cultural Events
Corporate boxes at football and baseball stadiums and at basketball arenas
are more popular now than ever. These facilities are impressive places to
entertain clients, and companies in major cities spend lavishly to impress
clients with their firms’ prestige.
In the same vein, cultural events such as plays and concerts have become
popular activities for business entertainment. In the following sections, I pro-
vide guidelines on behaving appropriately at such events.
Be on time
When you’re attending a play, concert, or other indoor event, it’s never
appropriate to arrive late — or leave early. Doing so is unfair to the artist or
performers, not to mention very disruptive to other members of the audi-
ence. Many theaters now require latecomers to remain in the hallway or the
lobby until the end of the first act. Yes, sometimes being late is unavoidable,
so always confirm the start time of the event or performance, and plan
accordingly.
Know who pays for what
As host, you invite clients, employees, or friends to your box or club expect-
ing them not to pay. Your invitation carries with it the presumption that you
will pay for the time your guests spend there and for their food and drink, if
any. This extends to tips.
The presumption that the host pays does not extend to buying equipment 
for your guest, however. If you invite a client to a game of tennis at your club,
you pay for his time on the court and for his refreshments and rental equip-
ment, but your guest is expected to arrive ready to play.
207
Chapter 14: Taking Part in a Variety of Social Off-Site Activities

Dress the part
Wearing cutoffs, jeans, a T-shirt, or a halter top to a private box for a sporting
event or to play sports at a private club is inappropriate. If you’re participat-
ing in sports, make sure that you have the right wardrobe and equipment for
the sport you will be playing. If you’re unsure, call ahead to ask about proper
attire. If you are attending an event as a spectator, don’t wear clothes that
make you the spectacle. Dressing appropriately and wearing proper clothing,
clean and neatly pressed garments, and well-matched accessories is a sign
that you’re professional and in tune with whatever is going on. The key when
attending sporting or cultural events is to ask about proper attire. You should
never be uncomfortable or present an image that isn’t you or that may be 
a negative image for your company.
If you stick to the rules or category of business casual or slightly less than
business casual, you will make a positive impression. (For more tips on vari-
ous styles of dress, see Chapter 4.) Overdressing or under-dressing will send
a strong message either way.
Respect other people’s space
Share space with others courteously. Always be aware of your surroundings,
and adapt your actions when necessary. For example:
 If someone in front of you is moving too slowly, walk around on the out-
side, saying, “Excuse me, please.” But don’t push through the middle 
of people walking together. Pushing and shoving at a public event are
unacceptable.
 Don’t hog the seats. When you’re in a stadium with unassigned seats,
make sure that you’re not taking up more space than you need. Move
down, and allow others to sit down or let them pass you easily.
 Sit up straight in your seat, too. Do not lean too far forward in your chair
so you crowd or are in the space of the person in front of you.
 If you’re wearing a hat while seated, be certain it isn’t obstructing the
view of the people behind you.
 Keep your elbows, knees, and feet within your designated space.
These rules also apply when you’re entering or exiting moving walkways,
escalators, elevators, and open stairways.
208
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

Monitor your noise level
Audiences enjoy events in a variety of ways, such as by eating, talking, cheer-
ing, clapping, and whistling. Depending on the event, you need to strike a cer-
tain balance between behaving graciously and being an overly enthusiastic
fan, drinking too much and acting obnoxious. Be aware of and sensitive to
those around you. Try not to distract others by talking when you should be
watching, or cheering too loudly. Monitor noise levels, especially if you are
with a large group of your colleagues.
If you attend an indoor event, try not to distract those around you by rustling
the program or eating food loudly. Leave alarmed watches or any dangling
jewelry at home. The same goes for cellular phones; turn them off, or turn on
the vibrate feature.
Watch what you say
Refrain from using any form of obscene, foul, or disrespectful language when
you’re out in public, especially where other people are within earshot. Children
or others nearby (including your coworkers) may find your words offensive.
Dispose of trash properly
It is obvious that we all know the consequences of leaving litter behind when
we’re outdoors. Not only is it an eyesore for others, it pollutes our environ-
ment and can be a danger to wildlife. The same thought should apply when
you’re attending an indoor event. Not only is leaving litter around an eyesore,
it can create a danger, and it shows you’re inconsiderate of those who have
to clean up after you. Yes, they may be paid maintenance personnel, yet it’s
courteous to think of others by making their jobs easier (this goes for servers
in restaurants). Show that you are aware of your surroundings and you care
about others by throwing your trash in the proper recycle bin or receptacle,
not on the ground. Extremely courteous folks will also pick up after others.

Marking Life’s Major 
Events and Passages
In This Chapter
 Giving and attending office parties
 Responding to birthdays, weddings, births, and funerals
 Deciding when to give gifts — or not
 Selecting appropriate gifts for every occasion
W
hen the heat is on and everyone is working full force, a break to cele-
brate a colleague’s new baby can seem superfluous, but it may be just
what everyone needs. Some people tend to dismiss office celebrations or to
look at them as contrived affairs that no one really enjoys. But recognizing
major events in the lives of your colleagues helps establish camaraderie and
cooperative working relations; it also lets you acknowledge your colleagues
as individual human beings.
People often feel uncomfortable at such gatherings, not because they don’t
like their colleagues, but because they’re not sure what to talk about. In this
chapter, you come to see that the social gatherings that occur in professional
life can be handled with grace.
Making the Most of Company Parties
General office parties are useful for building morale and celebrating accom-
plishments. They can also be held for special occasions, such as a colleague’s
50th birthday.
Office parties should be given for a reason and should be reasonably short.
Once or twice a year is plenty for the entire company to celebrate together
with a big bash.

When you’re planning an office party, the first thing to do is verify with your
boss that the time and day you want to have the party are open. Failing to do
this can throw the shadow of your boss’s displeasure over the party, and you
wouldn’t want that.
If your division or department is going to host an office party, send invita-
tions in the form of memos or e-mails if the party will be held in the office;
send formal invitations if the party is to be held outside the office. (See
Chapter 8 for details on invitations.) The invitation should include the 
reason for the party, where it’s to be held, and its start time and duration.
Delegate the details of the party as you require, but guarantee a successful
party by putting one person in charge. If donations will be involved, desig-
nate one person to collect the money, and specify whether the money will be
used for a gift, refreshments, or both. Don’t ask for too much money; if you
can’t get by with less than $5 or $10 from each person, look for some other
way to supplement the party kitty.
In the following sections, I provide specific guidelines on hosting an office
party and on attending an office party as a guest.
Hosting a restaurant gathering
As the host of a restaurant gathering, you’re responsible for the invitations
and the reservations. Select a restaurant where you’ve dined previously so
that you know what to expect. If the restaurant is new, try it out beforehand
to familiarize yourself with the menu and service.
When you arrive at the restaurant, make arrangements to pay the bill pri-
vately, so that no one else has the opportunity to dispute your generosity. 
If everyone is pitching in for the meal, the bill can come to the table. But
remember to clarify this matter before the meal.
For larger groups, the host can arrange ahead of time for a set menu with two
or more menu choices in each category ordered, at an all-inclusive set price
that everyone brings on the day of the event. This way, no one is caught off
guard by not having enough money on hand, and no one is upset at having to
fund those individuals who ordered one of everything off the menu. The key
is informing everyone of all the details before the event (such as whether
wine and cocktails are included or will have to be paid for separately) so
there are no surprises.
As host, you must dress in appropriate business attire. Being a little over-
dressed is better than being underdressed. If the restaurant is on the formal
side, you need to include this information in the invitation so that guests
don’t show up in jeans and T-shirts.
212
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

As host, you’re also responsible for making sure that no one gets out of hand
and that even the wallflowers have as good a time as they can. Do your best
to greet all your guests at the entrance (if possible) with a welcoming smile
and to thank them for coming. Try to introduce guests to one another as they
arrive and give a little information about each person to keep conversations
going. Also do your best to spend a few minutes with as many of the guests
as you can and keep an eye on the seating and the flow of the group — this
task can be essential for ensuring that all guests feel included. For more on
entertaining, check out Chapter 11.
Make sure, too, that no one drinks too much punch. Remember, “Loose lips
sink ships.” If you’re a nondrinker, don’t give in to social pressure to drink,
and don’t expect a nondrinking guest to indulge. Being drunk on company
time is a very bad idea, and as host, you can try to prevent it. In some situa-
tions, the host can be held legally responsible if something happens to an
intoxicated guest.
Being a well-behaved guest
When you’re a guest, your normal guest responsibilities are in order at the
office party. Behaving in a professional and considerate manner is important.
Being rude or thoughtless is never in style and can do serious damage to
your career. Whenever you’re a guest at an office party, you should treat 
the host and other guests as you would want to be treated.
Here are tips that will leave a positive impression and surely will please your
host:
 Respond to invitations promptly. A timely response is vital because the
host plans the menu and cost of the meal around the number of people
attending. I recommend responding within a day or two of receiving an
invitation; however, a response within three to four days is acceptable.
 Dress appropriately. Dressing appropriately shows respect. A well-
mannered host will let you know what the attire is for the event.
However, if you’re unsure of the attire, contact the host and ask.
 Don’t be late. Being fashionably late is unfashionably rude. Being prompt
is a guest’s most important responsibility. The host carefully chose a
time for the event to begin, and you must respect that choice by show-
ing up at that time. When an invitation specifies a time, you’re supposed
to arrive at that time.
You shouldn’t arrive later than 15 minutes after the scheduled start of an
event. If the event is a dinner party and you’re running late, phone ahead
to request that the host start without you. Arriving too early is as unac-
ceptable as arriving too late.
213
Chapter 15: Marking Life’s Major Events and Passages

 Don’t bring an uninvited guest with you. If an unexpected houseguest
happens to show up on the day of the scheduled event, you can call the
host and ask whether it’s possible for you to bring a friend. Present 
the question in a manner that doesn’t put the host on the spot.
 Be pleasant and cheerful. Introduce yourself to other guests if you don’t
know them (a possibility if significant others have been invited to an
office party). If everyone knows one another, mingling is still important
(and polite). Don’t spend the evening speaking to the same people you
hang out with at work. Take advantage of the opportunity to network,
and get to know the other employees.
 Watch your conversation. Conversations should include interests that
most people share. Confidential company information is off-limits; so are
tasteless jokes and any subjects that may be politically incorrect and
could cause others to become uncomfortable (such as office gossip).
 Stay sober, and avoid illegal drugs. Consume alcoholic beverages in
moderation in all business and social situations. Nothing spoils a good
party faster than forcing a host to deal with an inebriated guest who cre-
ates a scene.
 Mind your behavior. Even if everyone is feeling giddy, avoid baring your
soul to your favorite shipper, displaying a little too much affection for
your romantic partner (or that attractive new accountant you wish 
were your romantic partner), or making aggressive sexual advances to
any of your colleagues.
 Don’t complain or make negative comments about the room or the
meal. If something was wrong with the food, speak to the server or 
your boss quietly and discreetly.
 Know when it’s time to leave. If the majority of the guests have already
left, thank the host and head for the door. Try not to engage the host in 
a long goodbye that keeps him from the other guests.
 Follow up with a thank-you note, e-mail, card, or letter of appreciation.
You’re expected to send a thank-you note within a few days (the sooner,
the better!).
Employee Birthdays, Weddings, 
Babies, and Deaths
Although many people keep their work lives separate from their private lives,
everyone has a birthday; many people get married and/or have babies; and
many people will lose someone dear to them while you know them at work.
What are the best ways to mark these milestones with colleagues, clients,
and bosses?
214
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

Birthdays
There is no general requirement to mark every coworker’s birthday. From a
company perspective, celebrating the anniversary date of someone’s employ-
ment is more appropriate; the celebration of someone’s birthday should be
left as a personal celebration among coworkers.
Also keep in mind that some people prefer not to have others know their
exact age. Unless you know that people have personally spoken about their
birthdays and revealed their ages publicly, birthdays shouldn’t involve any-
thing relating to age. If a person has acknowledged his birthday, a card signed
by everyone in the office and perhaps a group lunch or a gift are in order.
Birthday gifts from a boss to an employee are always acceptable, but a birth-
day gift from a subordinate to a boss at the office needs to be handled with
utmost care. Others may perceive the gift as sycophantic behavior. So if
you’re giving the boss a gift, be discreet and do it privately. A group card or
group gift for a special birthday is better.
Weddings
Colleagues, clients, and bosses get married, and you won’t be invited to all
the weddings. Unfair? Maybe. But not everyone shares everything with
coworkers: Plenty of people draw a sharp, bold line between work and home.
Rather than being hurt, acknowledge that some people are just plain different
from you. If you’re invited, send a gift by all means. But even if you’re not
invited, organizing an office gift for your fellow worker is a nice gesture.
Try to be gracious to coworkers even if you’re hurt because you’re not
invited to their weddings. Often, a wedding budget is tight, or the couple
have their own reasons for limiting the guest list. Assume that the omission
wasn’t personal.
If you’re invited to a colleague’s or client’s wedding, remember that being
asked to attend is an honor. Act accordingly. Respond to the invitation
promptly (and with the same formality as the invitation itself), and send a gift
either to the bride’s parents or to the bride herself before or shortly after the
wedding. Don’t take gifts to the wedding. If the invitation is to you alone, go
alone; don’t bring an uninvited guest. And be on your best behavior at the
wedding.
A gift of money in the form of a check is always proper for weddings. On the
other hand, asking for money as a wedding gift is always wrong.
215
Chapter 15: Marking Life’s Major Events and Passages

Babies
Anticipating the birth of a baby can bring out the very best in people; unfor-
tunately, it can bring out the weirdest in people too. Occasionally, office
showers are painful experiences for all involved. The reason is simple: Having
a baby is necessarily an intimate affair, and you may not be on intimate terms
with all your coworkers. Yet there you are, discussing things with your col-
leagues that even some of your closest friends don’t know.
Avoid making the following mistakes:
 Touching a pregnant woman’s stomach.
 Asking a new parent detailed questions. Demanding a play-by-play
description of the delivery or subjecting others to every detail of your
own experience is not appropriate.
Unless you and others in your office are good friends with the person having
the baby, group gifts are preferable to office baby showers. Most parents-to-
be have gift registries at local department stores and/or online, so check
them ahead of time.
Funerals
At some point in your career, someone you work with will lose someone dear.
The death of a loved one is a wrenching, debilitating event for the survivors
as they confront not only their loss, but also their conflicted feelings toward
the person who died.
It isn’t at all unusual for survivors to go through a prolonged period of
mourning after the death, during which sociability and probably even perfor-
mance will lag. As a coworker or superior, you can help the grieving person
by offering to help, either in a condolence card or in person.
As soon as you hear about the loss, draft a letter of condolence in black ink
on a plain white fold-over card or a plain monarch sheet. (See Chapter 8 if
you need to brush up on your business stationery needs.) In this letter, your
compassion for the survivor should be apparent, as should your own lack of
ego. You should focus on the loss of the loved one and offer to do what you
can to help the survivor through the period of mourning. Be prepared never
to get any such request, however; most people mourn alone.
Don’t get caught making these mistakes:
216
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

 Talking about your own loss of a loved one in a letter of condolence is
uncaring and mean.
 Offering ribald memories of the dead person is inappropriate.
As a manager or boss, watch the griever carefully. Offer to help with the
griever’s job if necessary, and if it’s clear that she cannot work, offer time 
off. It will be welcome.
At funerals or memorial services, your dress should reflect the somber
nature of the occasion. Wear a dark gray, black, or navy blue suit with a white
shirt and dark tie if you’re a man, or a dark dress or suit with subdued jew-
elry if you’re a woman. Check with the funeral home or church about the
appropriateness of flowers. Often, the obituary explicitly states that flowers
aren’t preferred. Please take that advice seriously. If a memorial is suggested,
send your donation to the given address. You don’t need to mention that you
have done so. The organization receiving the gift will send an acknowledg-
ment card to the bereaved.
At all times, your comportment should be quiet and dignified. If there is a
receiving line, shake hands with everyone in it. If you’re unknown to the
family, identify yourself. If you don’t know the family, say something simple
and genuine, such as “I am so sorry for your loss.”
Widows and widowers often forget to eat in the weeks following their loss.
Taking food to them is a kindness. You don’t need to stay long when deliver-
ing it; you can even call ahead and leave it on the porch.
It’s important to be sensitive to any specific cultural customs, observances,
and rituals that grieving members may have during their period of mourning.
Find out what will take place and what may be expected of you during the
ceremony ahead of time, so you’ll be knowledgeable and act appropriately.
Pondering Whether to Give or Not to Give
Giving and receiving gifts cause considerable concern in business, for obvi-
ous reasons. Gifts can be used appropriately to thank clients for business, to
reward someone for a job well done, to celebrate a promotion, or to com-
memorate a long-term relationship. But gift-giving can also veer into undue
influence and bribery.
Two kinds of gift-giving occur in business. The first kind — between colleagues
and/or supervisors — is easier to justify and is less fraught with danger than
the second kind — gift-giving between companies.
217
Chapter 15: Marking Life’s Major Events and Passages

Gifts at work
Gift-giving between coworkers, especially during the holiday season, is a
common practice at many companies. If you work for such a company, you’ll
be considered churlish if you don’t participate. This situation is one of those
coerced acts of generosity that you really can’t ignore or belittle, so bite the
bullet and join in.
Avoid making holiday gifts explicitly religious.
Gifts for coworkers don’t have to be lavish and ought not to be too personal.
Something a colleague can use in the office, such as a coffee mug or a picture
frame, is just fine.
Group gifts for weddings, babies, and retirements are the norm. Here again,
don’t presume to know your recipient so well that you get him something
personal. Focus on the utilitarian and the practical, not the exciting or the
alluring.
Gifts for bosses are a different matter altogether. There is cause for concern
with giving a gift to a boss. You may look like you’re trying to curry favor with
her or, worse, bribe her. Besides, if you spend too much, your boss — who,
after all, knows what you make — may decide that you’re a toadying fool.
Follow these simple guidelines:
 Extravagant gift-giving is both bad strategy and poor taste. Others may
not share your love of lavish gifts, and they may resent you for going
overboard.
 Send group gifts rather than individual gifts to bosses.
 Sending a card or flowers to your boss if he has been ill or in the hospi-
tal is all right. However, flowers aren’t always allowed. Check with the
hospital first.
Gifts between companies
Gift-giving between companies or between employees of different companies
is a thorny issue — so thorny, in fact, that most organizations have explicit
rules governing the practice. The following sections discuss two kinds of cor-
porate gift-giving: gifts that you or your company presents to others, and gifts
that you or your company receives from others.
Giving gifts
Companies commonly give gifts to clients and customers during the holiday
season. So long as the gift isn’t ostentatious, this practice doesn’t seem to be
218
Part III: Behaving in the Boardroom and Beyond 

an attempt to curry favor, and so long as the gift is reasonably well made, it
doesn’t seem like an attempt to dump promotional items.
Be careful with humorous gifts. If you aren’t sure that the recipient will be
pleasantly amused, don’t send it.
Receiving gifts
You really have only one thing to consider: Know your company’s policy about
receiving gifts! Some companies don’t allow employees to receive any gifts
worth more than, say, $25; others require all gifts worth more than a specified
amount to be disclosed to supervisors or other managers.
Problems arise when you receive a gift that violates company policy. If you
receive season tickets for the Green Bay Packers, for example, and your com-
pany forbids acceptance of any gifts worth more than $100, you’re painfully
obliged to decline the gift. Ouch! If you’re in this predicament, you probably
will have to write a letter declining the gift.
Compose the letter in which you decline a gift carefully, focusing on your
company’s policy on receiving gifts, rather than on your personal feelings.
The company’s policy prevents you from accepting the gift, not your own 
displeasure. Say so.
Finding Appropriate Gifts 
for Every Occasion
After you figure out when giving and receiving a gift are appropriate, you may
still be mystified by the prospect of choosing a gift. Luckily, you have only a
few choices to make.
Make these distinctions between personal and business gifts:
 If you know a client or colleague well, socializing outside a business con-
text on a regular basis, you may want to give a personal gift for a birthday,
promotion, or holiday. Send or deliver such a gift to the person’s home.
 If you want to give a business gift, first familiarize yourself with your
firm’s gift policy, if any. Professional gifts can be quite varied, from food
or wine to small conveniences (such as a business-card holder or a new
pen) to office items (such as a picture frame or a computer accessory).
If you know your client well enough to have visited her office many
times, you may have had the opportunity to divine a welcome addition.
219
Chapter 15: Marking Life’s Major Events and Passages

Just as a distinction exists between personal and professional gifts, a distinc-
tion exists between perishable and lasting gifts:
 Perishable gifts are, as the name implies, gifts that have a short life, such
as food, flowers, and wine. Perishable gifts are fine for most professional
gift-giving between companies and between people who don’t know each
other well.
Flowers can be great gifts, but if you send long-stemmed roses to an
administrative assistant as a thank-you for her outstanding accomplish-
ment in getting everyone organized, you send the wrong message. Roses
traditionally have romantic overtones, which isn’t a professional mes-
sage. Tulips, a tasteful mixed bouquet, or a flowering plant would be a
better choice.
 Lasting gifts are intended to last longer — perhaps even a lifetime. Lasting
gifts are better reserved for especially significant events and for events
you want the other company or person to remember for a long time.
Whether a gift is temporary or permanent, personal or professional, take care
to present it competently wrapped and with a card. Otherwise, your inten-
tions will be sabotaged by your shoddy presentation. If you can’t wrap a box,
get someone else to do it, such as the customer-service counter at the store
where you purchase the gift.
It is better to give than to receive. In giving, you extend your everyday kind-
ness to an act whose only goal is kindness.

cover office conflicts and ways to find a smooth resolu-
tion, as well as ways to deal with difficult personalities.
This part also discusses some ethical dilemmas that

Chapter 16
Coming to Terms with 
Difficult People
In This Chapter
 Being a part of a team
 Dealing with your rivals
 Neutralizing difficult personalities
 Responding to impertinence
You know who the difficult people are: the manager who can’t control his
temper, the assistant who spreads malicious rumors about others, the
shipping clerk with the social skills of a mollusk, the colleague who stabs 
you behind your back, the leering network-technology specialist. They’re in
every business and at every level, and they can make your life miserable.
Some people are difficult because of their personalities; others are difficult
because of their positions in the company. In this chapter, you discover some
helpful techniques for coping with both types of people. By the end, you still
won’t be a qualified therapist, but you’ll know enough to help yourself and
others through a wide range of challenging situations.
Getting a Grip on Work Dynamics
Most businesses have a defined hierarchy; even businesses that don’t appear
to have much of one normally do. With a hierarchy comes competition for
the top spots, and with competition come rivalries and the need to cope 
with them. Some companies reward intraoffice competition; others work to
defuse it through team-building and training on how to have fun at work.

Teams
Many companies organize teams of people to work together to defuse compe-
tition among employees. Although this strategy may help the company in
some ways, productive individual initiative is always valued. Everyone knows
this, so everyone tries to find a way to both be a good team player and stand
out from the group.
Some people get recognized by engaging in outrageous stunts and by practic-
ing crude self-promotion. Sometimes these tactics work, but for the most
part, they don’t. The trick is to get yourself recognized while not losing your
status as a team player. That trick takes good manners.
Good manners are important for your rise to the top. You’ll get noticed
simply by respecting other team members and by being gracious. Your fair-
mindedness and graciousness, all by themselves, set you apart from most of
your colleagues. They show others — managers in particular — that when
you’re a member of a team, you aren’t a credit hog and thief (a personality
type I describe later in this chapter). You share credit where credit is due.
Rivals
Most people aren’t interested in your interests or in hindering your progress.
But some people have the same goals that you have. If you’re at roughly the
same level of the hierarchy, these folks are, in some sense, your rivals. Your
respect for others and good manners are among your best allies in handling
them. You can even use manners to defeat the bad apples who play dirty.
Some rivals play rough. They blast away at you in meetings; they go behind
your back to superiors; they spread rumors about you. Rough players 
scope you out to see whether you’re willing to play their game. If you’re not
well-versed in their techniques, you’ll lose, for they rely on their knowledge
of you and their ability to bait you into doing something you’ll regret.
You don’t want to play this game for three very good reasons:
 Rivals who play rough probably have been doing it since childhood.
They’re good at it.
 Good managers recognize rough players for what they are and don’t tol-
erate them long.
 The most effective countermeasure against rough rivals is demonstrating
that even though you recognize them for what they are, you won’t be
ruffled and can’t be bothered to lower yourself to their level.
224
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

Your best bet is to expose the rough players for the bitter so-and-sos they are
by killing them with good manners. When they arrive at the office before you
do, compliment them on their initiative. When they criticize you in a meeting,
thank them for their views, and politely point out the existence of other perti-
nent facts that, had they only known them, may have changed their minds.
When they maneuver to oust you from the A team, counter with your creden-
tials and your track record of teamwork.
Luckily, most rivals aren’t that rough. Almost everyone is interested in get-
ting promoted, but most people rely on their good work and their good repu-
tations to get a promotion. Again, good manners are an integral part of your
good reputation, so use them to your advantage.
If — just out of obtuseness — someone picks on your work and your input in
meetings, stand up to her politely and firmly. The workplace is governed by
professional civility; you’re under no obligation to be the butt of someone
else’s meanness. If you have to, go to the offender’s superior, and ask that the
offender be notified that you’ve had enough. If the carping is persistent, keep
a written record of the offenses, and submit your concerns to a superior. If
the superior is the one who’s picking on you, go to her superior.
Understanding Problem Personalities
A few people will take your best behavior as a weakness to be exploited. Show
them otherwise. No better gauge of your strength of character exists than
your unfailing politeness. The person who treats others with respect is a
walking refutation of social cheaters. The hothead, the rumormonger, the
credit hog and thief, the braggart, the bully, the manipulator, the malcontent,
and the Machiavelli are the ones who show that they’re weak. By acting the
way they do, they betray their own belief that they can succeed (if they suc-
ceed at all) only by abandoning control.
I know what you’re saying: “That all sounds fine, but you have no idea how
the jerks I have to put up with treat me. Having good manners sounds fine in
theory, but when the chips are down, I’m gonna have to fight back, aren’t I?”
True enough, you need to know how to handle colleagues and superiors who
are problems. But you can defeat these problematic people in lots of ways
other than fighting back on their terms.
The hothead
Hotheads have a hard time controlling their tempers. Most hotheads are
embarrassed by their bad tempers and, after flailing away for five minutes,
apologize profusely.
225
Chapter 16: Coming to Terms with Difficult People

The way to deal with a hothead is to let him blow his stack . . . privately, if at
all possible. Suggest that he vent in his office. This suggestion won’t go down
well with the hothead, because he probably requires an audience. If you’re
well suited to it — that is, if you have a hide as thick as an elephant’s — offer
to listen to him. If not, tell him that you’re sorry, but you prefer that he not let
off steam in your presence. This tactic won’t always work, but at least you’ll
have expressed your disapproval, and if it happens again, you can politely
leave the room.
The rumormonger
Gossip is unavoidable and, for the most part, benign; it’s just people’s way of
showing that they’re interested in other people. You do yourself no favors by
standing proudly aloof from all the tidbits that fly around an office. On the
other hand, you don’t want to be labeled a gossip. So although you can be
receptive to gossip, it’s not in your best interest to spread negative or poten-
tially damaging information about other people. Instead, focus on positive
gossip.
The rumormonger is a different story. She lives on gossip, using it to skewer
others and to advance her own career. She’s trouble for you because you may
become the subject of some juicy bit of her gossip.
When a rumormonger’s attention turns to some salacious tidbit regarding
you, you have only one strategy: Confront her. You’re under no obligation to
confront her if the gossip is about someone else, although you may want 
to come to the defense of a friend or a colleague. But if the story is about you
or yours, confront the rumormonger politely and publicly — politely because
you don’t want to embarrass her, and publicly because you want to ensure
that others hear her recant. Malicious gossips rely on staying in the shadows
to flourish. Confronting them publicly forces them out of the shadows. Most
will wilt on the spot.
The credit hog and thief
The credit hog tries to take all the credit when some is due to others. The
credit thief takes any credit he can find, even when it belongs to someone
else. Dealing with either requires the same skill: Ensure that you get the
credit you deserve. This is easier said than done sometimes, but you can 
do it. A private chat, in which you point out that other people helped on the
project and deserve credit, sometimes works. If it doesn’t, offer to write 
the update memos so that the credit hog doesn’t have the opportunity to
monopolize reporting on the project. If that tactic doesn’t work either, talk 
to a superior. Point out the problem, and ask what to do.
226
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

The braggart
The person who brags or name-drops can be incredibly annoying. When you
look closer at this personality type, you normally see an insecure person who
exhibits a lack of self-esteem and self-confidence by trying to impress others
with their accomplishments, their travel, or the people they know. Bragging
also can be a form of intimidation. Sometimes, braggarts are just trying to be
friendly, but unfortunately, they just don’t know that their excessive bragging
is unacceptable and many times makes them look foolish.
You may want to avoid the braggart, but the best approach is to respond with
short comments, such as “Oh really?” or “That’s interesting.” Then change
the subject or ask a question unrelated to the braggart’s comments. Try your
best not to encourage her to continue bragging if you’re not really interested.
Eventually, she may get the hint if you aren’t showing that you’re impressed.
The bully
The bully tries to threaten you into doing things you’d rather not do and
aren’t required to do. The only way to deal with a bully is to stand up to him
on the first occasion and continue standing up to him. The problem usually is
that you’re so astonished by what he’s doing that you can’t think of a snappy
comeback.
Luckily, you need no more of a snappy comeback than your good manners.
Always be ready with a calm and polite retort that offers some compromise
between what the bully wants and what you’re willing to do. When your super-
visor tells you on Friday to get those reports ready by the end of the weekend,
or you’re toast — and you know that the reports don’t need to be ready until
the following Friday — reply that sadly, you have firm plans for the weekend.
But couple that politely phrased refusal with the offer to take the reports with
you and to do whatever is necessary to have the reports ready by, say,
Wednesday.
If you’re unlucky enough to work for an unrepentant bully, look for another
job. Things will never get better.
The manipulator
The manipulator tells half-truths. She lies; she reveals only what she thinks 
is in her interest to reveal; she routinely conceals information from you. 
She’s a royal pain-in-the-you-know-what. The manipulator focuses on others’
weaknesses and tries to take advantage of those weaknesses to make herself
look better.
227
Chapter 16: Coming to Terms with Difficult People

Manipulators are masters at their craft, and you’re not going to outdo them.
Have your ducks in order so that when a manipulator starts her little game,
you can counter with the facts. Be prepared to say no or do whatever it takes
to avoid being used.
Some manipulators sugarcoat their machinations with offers of generosity.
You’ll soon find out that a tit-for-tat expectation is always attached to these
offers. Learn quickly, and be safe: Refuse the offers!
Here are some more ideas for dealing with a manipulator:
 If the manipulator tries to get you to do something that you think is
against policy, put her off long enough to check on the policy yourself.
 If the manipulator tries to slide something unwanted past your team,
challenge her in public to defend her suggestion.
 If the manipulator succeeds in getting you to do something that you
know is a mistake or is against your interests, put the facts in writing,
and submit them to the proper manager.
The malcontent
The malcontent is the kind of person who, when you say “Good morning,”
accuses you of being friendly because you secretly hate him. His responses
are so far from the norm that you can’t anticipate them — and don’t even
think of protecting yourself from them.
Malcontents are impossible. Fortunately, most malcontents aren’t threats and
don’t require you to do anything other than continue to be your usual friendly
and polite self. They can stew in their unhappiness, if they want.
If a malcontent slides into manipulation or bullying to feed his perverse hap-
piness in resentment, action probably is required. But the best defense
against manipulation and bullying is blithe disregard of the attempts to goad
you into doing something you’ll regret. Let the malcontent try to irritate you.
Mom was right: Just ignore him!
The Machiavelli
The Machiavelli is your worst enemy, because she wants power and nothing
but power. Worse, she’s smart, calculating, and tenacious. She’ll adopt what-
ever pose she needs to so she can get more power.
My advice: Stay far, far away. Most Machiavellis self-destruct, and those who
don’t are poison to you. The truth is that most Machiavellis are pretenders.
228
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

They’re crude, and sooner or later, they’ll make a fatal miscalculation. When
they do, you can watch them free-fall out of the company without going along
for the ride.
Machiavellis who are successful rise only to a certain level, beyond which their
naked lust for power is harmful to the company. There, they fester, becoming
malcontents. And you already know how to deal with malcontents!
You can’t always stay away from Machiavellis, of course. Some people work
for power junkies, and others have no choice but to work with one. These
environments are among the most difficult you can work in. If the Machiavelli
is your boss, know ahead of time that power, for her, is something that only
one person can have, and that person is her. She has no extra power to share
with you. If you find this kind of working relationship intolerable, my advice
is that you look for another job.
Taking a Deep Breath and Relaxing 
after an Irritating Run-In
No, you really didn’t deserve that dressing-down from your boss. And you
certainly didn’t deserve being called an “incompetent moron” or any of the
other names he saw fit to utter. But he’s your boss, and except for these
tirades, he’s a pretty good one. Besides, the problem probably is just the
stress he’s been experiencing.
Petty annoyances are inevitable consequences of being with other people in
confined spaces. You encounter hundreds of irritants in a workday — the
person who smacks her lips eating breakfast at her desk; the person who’s a
drummer for Nine Inch Nails during all your phone calls; the person who puts
his dirty running shoes up on your desk when he talks to you; the boss who
yells too much; the colleague whose cologne permeates your cubicle like
smoke; and all the problem personalities I write about earlier in this chapter.
What are you supposed to do? The first thing to do is count to ten and relax.
Other people will irritate you; you just have to be ready for irritations. If
you’re constantly surprised by the strange things people say, eat, or smell
like, your first change should be of your expectations. People are different —
often, irritatingly so. Deal with it! Remember the morning affirmation of
Marcus Aurelius, an emperor of Rome: “Today, I will be surrounded by people
who irritate me. I will not demonstrate my irritation.”
The next thing to do is figure out the most helpful strategies for cooling your
temper when the temperature starts to climb. I talk about this matter in more
detail in Chapter 17, but here, I present some simple suggestions for those
first few minutes when you’re worried that you’re going to explode.
229
Chapter 16: Coming to Terms with Difficult People

When someone does something that really bugs you:
 Look away and count to ten. Repeat as necessary until you calm down!
 Excuse yourself from the situation to get a drink of water.
 Imagine that you’re doing your favorite activity in your favorite place.
 Remind yourself that in a certain number of hours, you’ll be on your way
home.
 Return to your desk or office, sit quietly for a few minutes, and plan your
response.
 Kill ’em with kindness. In other words, rise above the situation, and
always demonstrate calmness and patience.
If you’re in a position in which you have to make an instant response to an
incredibly annoying comment, swallow hard and be polite, but remember to
stick up for yourself and your ideas.
It’s never necessary to respond to rudeness with rudeness. Always take the
higher ground. You’ll not only feel better about yourself, but it also makes a
positive impression on the job. There are lots of ways to defeat these prob-
lematic people other than fighting back on their terms.
230
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 
Helpful hints for dealing with an invasive question
Some people just don’t know any better than to
ask questions you have no interest in answering
or to engage you in conversation on topics you
would rather not discuss. Sometimes, these
people are just trying to be friendly. Unfortunately,
they don’t know that their excessive inquisitive-
ness is unacceptably invasive.
Suppose that your colleague Raul asks you
about the story he saw in the paper about your
dad’s recent arrest for gardening in the nude.
You’re embarrassed by the question (and by
your father!). You’d hoped that the matter would
never come up. What do you do?
a) Say that it’s a long family tradition to garden
in the nude, and wink.
b) Give Raul a withering glare.
c) Apologize, but reply firmly that you won’t
answer the question.
d) Ask Raul why he’s asking (“So why do you
ask?”).
Not surprisingly, any of these responses is fine.
Each has its advantages, and each has its dis-
advantages. But generally, the best approach to
responding to impertinent questions is politely
asking the questioner why he’s asking. Also,
smile — which usually embarrasses the other
person enough to withdraw the question.

or many people, conflict — at work or at home — is difficult. You proba-
bly know people who would rather move than confront a neighbor about
his barking dog or the annual Summer Picnic and Bagpiping Competition. But
believe it or not, some conflict is actually helpful. In this chapter, you find out
why. The chapter also introduces some effective conflict-management tools.
You and your colleagues can get along better by knowing these tools. More
important, you and your boss can get along better, too!
Realizing That Conflict Can 
Be Good (It’s True!)
Though having a conflict takes guts, it can be useful — even energizing. At
work, conflict can help bring up issues that need attention, such as processes
that don’t make sense anymore but are “the way it’s always been done.”
Conflict can also give birth to excellent ideas. If everyone agrees with the first
idea the boss tosses out, that idea may be the only one that ever comes up,
even though it may not be very good. When the team debates an issue, how-
ever, many more thoughts and opinions emerge, often producing a superior
result.
Pick your battles. Debate can be productive, but after a decision is made, you
need to get in line. Don’t undermine the team by saying things like “Well, it
wasn’t my idea, but I guess we’re going to go with that stupid ad campaign
anyway.”

R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Aretha demands it, and your colleagues deserve it too. In fact,
perhaps the single most important key to effective conflict is respecting
others’ opinions and their right to speak up. If someone works in the same
place you do, chances are that she’s done something right to get there. Even
if you disagree with a colleague’s opinion, you can still respect her intelli-
gence and integrity. If you’re sure that she’s a moron, keep that conclusion 
to yourself — even when you chat with your office buddies.
Showing respect for other people’s opinions is more than just biting your
tongue on witty putdowns. It also includes controlling
 Facial expressions: Even when your mouth is closed, rolling your eyes
and smirking show a lack of respect.
 Body language: Refrain from shaking your head or looking around the
room as though you can’t wait for the other person to finish.
 Other actions: You’re not fooling anyone when you kick other colleagues
under the table and give them significant looks.
When the conflict involves people and their behavior, however, it usually
becomes significantly more challenging, and it’s often a serious drain on
energy and resources. These types of conflicts can be destructive rather 
than productive because, in many cases, people with personality conflicts
simply don’t have much respect for each other, which can make for a difficult
situation.
Managing Conflict with Your Peers
You’ve been working for months to get promoted, and you’ve finally made it
to that corner cubicle near the snack room, the restroom, and the parking lot.
Life is good for the first few days as you work on the great new strategy you’ll
present at Friday’s meeting.
You make your presentation, and you feel great. Then a voice pipes up from
the back of the room: “We tried that last year, and it didn’t work.” Maybe the
speaker is the person who was passed over for the promotion you got. Maybe
he’s the person who takes a pessimistic view of everything. Maybe she’s the
woman you stood up on prom night in high school and who’s returned 15
years later to haunt you. Whoever it is, that person has scratched and dented
your shiny new idea.
You can manage office conflict ineffectively in lots of ways. Locking your door
and blasting your radio is one way; taking aim with coffee is another. Try a
more productive solution. Thinking some evil thoughts is okay at this point,
232
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

as long as they stay inside your head and don’t appear on your face or fly out
of your mouth. It’s also okay to go home and complain to your long-suffering
spouse, friends, or dog. Pretty soon, however, you’re going to have to discuss
the issue with your detractor in a mature and professional manner.
Vent if you must, but not at work
Complaining about this person to someone else may help — if you can find
someone who’s willing to listen. But avoid venting to other people at the
office or to other people who know the person. Even if you trust the person
you’re venting to, your comments may eventually get back to their target,
causing an even bigger problem.
Many companies today now have mentoring programs in which each employee
is assigned to a designated mentor. This person is perhaps the best person to
whom you vent your issues and who can help you in the best way.
The privacy of your car is a great place to vent your frustrations, as long as
you don’t vent them on other drivers by driving aggressively. Use your com-
mute time to say all those things you would never say at the office. After you
get them out, you’ll probably feel better. Just ignore the people in the next
car who are pointing and gaping; you’re emotionally healthy.
Put yourself in the other person’s shoes
Try to understand where the other person is coming from. Are you new to the
department, newly promoted, much younger or older, or much more beautiful
than your peers? Consider the fact that some people may be intimidated by
you, and be professional and respectful until they get to know you better.
Has the other person in this conflict been in his job for a long time? If so, a
certain weariness may have set in after years of the daily grind. You can’t fix
that problem. You can be willing to listen and compromise, however, without
letting him affect your own attitude.
You can discover a lot by paying attention to how your boss or coworkers
react to you. Take notice if you’ve had the same response from more than
one person. Perhaps you need to extend yourself beyond your comfort zone
and make an effort to be open to others’ advice or recommendations.
233
Chapter 17: Managing Office Conflict

Practice active listening
Most of us spend plenty of time talking but not much time hearing what other
people have to say, especially during an emotional conflict that may push a
few buttons. Here’s how to become an active listener:
 Set the stage by setting your phone to “do not disturb,” turning away
from the computer or other distractions, and facing the person you’re
talking to. If people have a habit of barging into your office, close the
door or find a conference room or a quiet corner of the cafeteria to have
important discussions.
 Sit in a neutral position. Sitting on opposite sides of a conference table
puts you on equal footing; sitting behind your desk while the other
person sits in front of your desk gives you more perceived power. 
That perception is just what you don’t want the other person to have 
in this situation, because it immediately puts her on the defensive.
 Clear your mind of your own point of view. Your goal is to listen and
understand your partner’s point of view without considering how it
stacks up against yours. During discussions, people often miss someone
else’s point because they’re busy thinking about what they want to say
next. If you’re concerned about being able to respond to everything
later, take notes. (If you take notes, you may want to explain that you’re
doing it so you can really concentrate and remember. Otherwise, your
partner may think that he’s undergoing a psychological profile.)
 Encourage the other person to keep talking by nodding or asking her
to continue, but don’t interrupt. Wait until the other person has said
everything she wants to say. At that point, you should understand her
point of view, even if you still don’t agree with it. That’s your basis for
negotiation and compromise.
Ask clarifying questions
So you tried some strategy before, and it didn’t work. Ask your partner to
explain more about how or why it didn’t work. Were the circumstances the
same? Was the project funded and supported by upper management last
time? Was the plan given enough time to work? You should be open to accept-
ing that your plan really won’t work and that you need to start over. On the
other hand, you may be able to identify problems that could be fixed this
time around.
234
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

Be willing to compromise your 
ideas, but not your ethics
Somehow, compromise has turned into a bad word in our culture. Although
you may not want to compromise your ethics, most work situations don’t
require you to do so, and you can almost always find some areas where
you’re willing to give up an idea to gain something else. Another term for this
concept is consensus-building.
One thing you should never compromise, however, is your ethics. If a peer
suggests that you cheat a supplier, for example, let him know that you’re not
comfortable doing it. If he insists, you may need to involve your manager. If
the manager also insists, it’s time to use your company’s open-door policy to
go over your manager’s head. It also may be time to find a new job.
Always try to manage peer conflict by yourself first. Involve your manager
only if absolutely necessary. Handling the situation yourself is good experi-
ence for your next move up the organizational ladder.
Restrict your comments to 
behavior, not personality
Never say something like “You’re a loudmouthed jerk, and I can’t understand
how someone like you ever got into management.” Instead, say something
like this: “When you interrupt me during meetings, I feel like I can never finish
what I have to say. I think that’s one of the reasons we can’t seem to get past
this conflict.” The next time the person interrupts you, call her on it. Some
people — especially those from families of ten children, who are accustomed
to fighting for every shred of attention — aren’t even aware that they’re cut-
ting other people off.
Watch your language
If you’re in the habit of swearing at work, stop. Even if you do it only when
you’re angry, many people will be so shocked by your inventive variations on
the F word that they’ll be unable to concentrate on what you’re trying to say.
Swearing does not make you appear to be more intelligent.
235
Chapter 17: Managing Office Conflict

Look at the big picture
Perspective is important. Yes, work is a big part of your life, but it’s not your
whole life. Keep in mind that this challenging person is only one person and
that in today’s job-switching environment, you probably won’t be working
with him forever.
Resolving a Conflict with Your Boss
Need to resolve a conflict with your boss? Again, the answer comes down to
respect — on your part, on your boss’s part, or both. She may see you as a
threat, a loudmouth, unintelligent, or just plain obnoxious. You may view her
as incompetent, unfeeling, or a young whippersnapper with nothing to teach
you. But she has a direct effect on your future, even if you think of her as
Machiavelli on acid.
What should you do? Look for her good points; she does have at least one,
and probably more. Try to understand her point of view and the pressure
she’s under as a manager. Concentrate on her behavior and her treatment of
you, not on her annoying laugh or unsettling physical attributes. Most of all,
remember that she’s the boss — a fact that’s not likely to change.
If you feel that you’re being treated unfairly, address the problem with her
directly and politely. As a manager, she should be open to constructive criti-
cism. If she refuses to acknowledge your concerns, weigh your options:
 You could put up with your current situation.
 You could look for another job.
 You could talk to human resources for advice — and if that department
has had numerous complaints about her in the past, one more com-
plaint could be what is needed to take action.
 You could approach her boss, which may help significantly but which
puts you at risk of alienating her.
Unfortunately, no single answer is right. Use your best judgment.
To maintain work stability and job security, avoid annoying your boss. Make
every effort to be part of a positive work environment. Keep the following
tips in mind:
 Study your boss’s behavioral profile. Try your best to anticipate his
needs and wants. Is he a micromanager? Does he prefer written or
verbal reports?
236
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

 If you have a problem to discuss with your boss, always take a positive
approach, and try to have a solution to the problem.
 Do your best to understand your boss’s priorities.
 Make sure that you’re both on the same page by keeping the lines of
communication open.
 If a conflict arises, as with your coworkers, always keep your cool.
Managing Conflict If You’re the Boss
Managing people isn’t always easy, especially when you have to handle dis-
putes and conflict within the office. That chore is why you’re getting the big
bucks. Two reasons why you’re a manager in the first place are that you get
along well with others and that you’ve demonstrated your coolness under
fire in the past. So get ready . . . the qualities that got you the promotion will
now be put to the test on a regular basis in keeping those two brilliant hot-
heads you hired from ripping each other to pieces. And while you’re keeping
them from engaging in their favorite pastime, you have to protect yourself
from becoming their next victim.
A manager at a large tech company was dealing with two employees, Sally
and Phil, who were at each other’s throats continually — arguing loudly in
staff meetings, spreading vicious gossip, even threatening each other with
bodily harm. He was tired of these disruptions, but so far, his reprimands
hadn’t worked. Finally, he blew up in a staff meeting, called both of the
employees idiots, and suggested that they go back to the sandbox where 
they belonged. Phil immediately made a call to human resources, and the
manager ended up with a reprimand.
What did this manager do wrong? He violated two of the cardinal rules 
of employee relations: Never ridicule an employee, and don’t discipline an
employee in front of other people. I provide additional tips for managing 
conflict between employees in the following sections.
Address small problems before 
they become big ones
As a good manager, be proactive and polite about small problems so that you
don’t have to be reactive and rude when they fester into big problems. If a
new employee is listening to loud music at her desk, don’t wait for another
employee to complain. Instead, you could say something like this: “I’m not
237
Chapter 17: Managing Office Conflict

sure if you’ve had a chance to read the employee handbook yet, but we sug-
gest that people listen to music with headphones.” Chances are that she’ll be
happy to comply, and you’ll have nipped a problem in the bud.
Try a one-on-one chat
If the problem seems to be primarily one employee, meet with him alone. Find
out what the problem is without being accusatory. Instead of saying “Everyone
here knows that you and Sally can’t seem to get along, and it’s damaging our
productivity,” say “It seems to me that there’s something going on between you
and Sally. Is that true?” If so, ask the employee to tell his side of the story. If he
insists that there’s no problem, talk to Sally.
Try sitting the employees down
After you’ve had a chat with both employees individually, try speaking to both
of them together. Again, your approach should be exploratory, not accusatory.
If they try to interrupt each other, say something like this: “Sally, I promise to
listen to everything you have to say, but at the moment, Phil has the floor.”
Make sure that you’ve scheduled plenty of time to hear both employees out. 
If one or both of them want to meet with you alone, make time for that too.
No, conflict resolution probably isn’t how you want to spend your time — but
that’s management.
Don’t play favorites
You may like Phil better because he has a better sense of humor or because
he brings bagels every Friday. Put that preference aside, and focus only on
the behavior in this particular conflict. If Phil is the one who’s acting inappro-
priately, you need the maturity as a manager to let him know, even if doing so
affects your friendship.
Appeal to the employees’ sense 
of teamwork and fair play
Let both employees know that you have faith in their intelligence, ethics, and
ability to work things out. Ask each of them to identify an area or two where
they could compromise to make things work, and ask them to commit to
changing that behavior.
238
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

Let the employees know you’re serious
Be sure that the employees know that maintaining the status quo isn’t
acceptable. You’ll be watching, and if they don’t follow through on their
mutual commitment to change their behavior, they’ll be hearing from you.
Don’t be afraid to ask for help
Your manager relies on you to handle what you can, but he’s also there to
help you when you need it. After the current crisis has cooled down — or
before it happens — ask about management training that will help you deal
with these situations. If your company doesn’t have a formal training pro-
gram, plenty of training outfits would love to help you. Check your local tele-
phone directory or the Internet.
Employees in a professional environment very rarely resort to physical
attacks, but they’ve been known to happen. Be ready to cut the discussion
short and call human resources or security if matters get really out of hand.
(If you suspect that a problem may arise, consider informing security in
advance.) Whatever you do, don’t participate in the violence yourself.
If in the end, the warriors just can’t get along, you’re going to have to make a
painful decision to split them up, either by reassigning one or both of them or
by firing one or both of them. A good manager knows that she has to bring
the ax down when, despite her best efforts and the best efforts of the war-
riors, the situation just doesn’t get better.
Staying Out of the Fray 
If You’re a Spectator
Whether you’re a manager or not, don’t allow yourself to be sucked into con-
flicts that don’t concern you. Many people who have good conflict-resolution
skills themselves — and many who don’t! — can’t resist the temptation to
“help” others with their problems. Don’t do it! At least one of the parties
probably will resent your intrusion, and other people will perceive you as a
meddling busybody without enough work to do. People who try to solve
other people’s problems at work often find conflict oddly titillating and like to
gossip. Even if you don’t deserve that reputation, you may get it if you’re not
careful.

Chapter 17: Managing Office Conflict

Maria, a computer programmer, had always prided herself on the good advice
she gave her friends about their relationships at work. In fact, many of her
friends came to her for advice. Maria knew that she would make a great man-
ager, but so far, she hadn’t had that opportunity. So when she saw two people
at work who were continually angry at each other, she wanted to help. She
talked with Venkat and Bill separately to find out their respective sides of the
story; then she served as a go-between.
Unfortunately, her good intentions backfired. Both Bill and Venkat thought
that she was taking the other person’s side, and they both stopped talking to
her. Her manager got wind of the situation and asked Maria to please concen-
trate on her own work. Maria was crushed, because she was only trying to
help. That fall, however, she started back to school and is now a licensed 
corporate conflict manager. She has gained the authority and expertise to 
do what she loves: helping people work out their differences in the office.
If your peers come to you for advice at work, resist the temptation to get
involved. You may be safe in suggesting strategies that have worked for you
in the past (“When I had a problem with one of my colleagues last year, I just
sat down and had an honest discussion with her, and it was really helpful.
She just didn’t realize that she was bothering me, and I learned some things I
did that bothered her.”). But never get involved in the current situation or
make comments like “I’ve heard that Ronnie’s a total nightmare to work with.
I feel sorry for you.” That sort of comment only polarizes the situation fur-
ther. Don’t take on other people’s problems. Instead, give yourself a pat on
the back for having learned how to resolve your own conflicts!

Dilemmas at Work

 Saying “no” and still keeping your job
N
o one is immune from ethical dilemmas at work. If the company you
work for is well organized and has a clear set of policies, ethical dilem-
mas can be minimized, but they can no more be eliminated than can the plea-
sure you get from doing a good job. Ethical dilemmas are part of life, so they
are part of your professional life as well.
No single chapter in any book can capture every nuance of the ethical issues
that emerge in the workplace, but I offer some suggestions about some of the
most common ethical issues arising at work. In this chapter, I introduce some
of the ethical issues that come from your role as an employee.
Billing the Company for Expenses
Pretty obviously, when you work for a company, you’re employed to work for
that company. In return, you receive a salary and the opportunity to learn a
great deal. While you’re at work, you should spend your time doing what you
are expected to do — not straightening out your private life or browsing the
Internet for hours on end, looking for interesting facts about Tahiti.
Your company may ask you to travel. While you’re traveling on business, you
are expected to remain focused on your job. You may incur expenses while
doing the company’s work on your travels, of course, and you may ask the
company to compensate you for those expenses.

If you’re a manager, it’s your responsibility to be educated about your com-
pany’s expense-report policies. If your company doesn’t allow gifts or alcohol
charges as expenses, for example, inform your employees of that rule before
they travel. If exceptions arise, employees need to know what those excep-
tions are. Suppose that one of your sales representatives stays at a friend’s
apartment when she travels to New York for a convention, saving the com-
pany $280 a night for five nights. Can she claim as an expense the $20 bottle
of wine that she gave her hosts? How about the cost of the taxi rides between
her friend’s apartment and the convention site, the taxi ride back from the
Broadway play to which she took a client, or the ticket for that play? Make
the rules clear.
When you’re doing the company’s work and spending money as an employee,
you may ask the company to reimburse you, and when you’re not doing the
company’s work or not spending money as an employee, you may not ask to
be reimbursed. Always confirm with your boss and CFO what will and won’t
be allowable expenses before the trip.
Keep these tips in mind:
 Clarify acceptable and unacceptable expenses before going on your trip.
 Most companies appreciate any reasonable ways to cut costs.
 Keep expense-report receipts safely together. Use a credit card rather
than cash so you have an additional record on your credit card 
statement.
 When you fill out your expense report, attach all the receipts for money
spent while you were on company time.
If you host a business dinner while traveling, you usually can include that in
your expense report. If you work for a company that doesn’t compensate for
alcohol, not even wine at dinner, try to separate the alcohol portion of the
bill from the meal portion. If you can’t do that, compute the amount spent 
for the meal and the proportion of the tip that went to the waiter for the
meal, and submit only that expense.
Don’t pad your expense reports. If you rent a car for a business trip and add
three days to the trip for a little sightseeing, you aren’t entitled to charge the
company for those three days. If you buy your daughter a gift at the airport
gift shop, you aren’t entitled to charge the company for it. Smart accountants
have seen most of these tricks before, and you’re unlikely to get away with
them. But the heart of the matter is that padding your expense report is
unfair to the company. Even if the company isn’t always fair to you, you have
no reason to be unfair in return.
242
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

Understanding Loyalty, Confidentiality,
and Security
Typically, you work for someone else, who pays you a salary. That relationship
establishes the expectation that you owe your professional loyalty to the com-
pany or person you work for. It almost certainly means that you’ll learn things
that, if disclosed, would damage others or the company. But what are you sup-
posed to do when, in the name of loyalty, you’re asked to do something wrong?
And how far are you obliged to respect confidentiality?
Loyalty
Loyalty is a valued commodity in the business world. Many employers list it
as the most important virtue that an employee can have. It’s not surprising
that loyalty is so valued; employees who look to promote the business’s
interests and defend it against competition are essential for a successful 
company.
When the company’s values overlap with your own, being loyal to the com-
pany is easy. Trouble arises when either a colleague or a boss asks you to do
something you know is wrong and invokes your loyalty in making the request.
This kind of request or demand can come camouflaged in many ways and
may never be explicit. But the implication is always clear: You’re expected to
do something that you know is wrong to demonstrate your loyalty to your
colleague, your boss, or that amorphous entity, the company.
People in positions of authority shouldn’t ask their subordinates to lie for
them. If you’re a manager, and you’re doing something on company time that
you shouldn’t be doing, just tell your assistant that you’re unavailable. Don’t
try to take advantage of someone else’s loyalty to you or to the company.
Likewise, subordinates shouldn’t agree to lie for their bosses. Loyalty is one
thing; lying in the name of loyalty is something else entirely. If your boss asks
you to lie for her, politely give her an opportunity to back away from the
request. Tom could, for example, have asked: “You want me to tell the owner
you’re in Denver arranging financing when in fact you’re in Pebble Beach?”
If your boss doesn’t back down from the request that you lie, ask an even
more pointed question, such as “You want me to lie?” If your boss doesn’t get
the hint that you’re unwilling to comply by now, tell her politely that as much
as you respect her and enjoy working with her, you won’t lie for her.
243
Chapter 18: Managing Ethical Dilemmas at Work

Be prepared for the worst. Some bosses will take your refusal in stride;
others won’t. If your boss does, you’ve established a ground floor, and she’ll
respect you for it. If the boss is angered by your refusal, you can expect any-
thing from a grunt of disapproval to a campaign of discrimination.
Confidentiality
As an employee, you know things that, were they to be disclosed, might hurt
you, your colleagues, your bosses, or your company. Many companies have
nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements written into employment con-
tracts. Many others discuss confidentiality in their employee guidelines. Take
confidentiality seriously!
Generally speaking, two kinds of confidential information exist: proprietary
company information and information about people.
Company information
Every business has proprietary information — information about jobs, layoffs,
and performance reviews; information about patents and contracts; informa-
tion about sales and earnings; information about product developments. The
list goes on and on. What should you do, as an employee, to avoid disclosing
confidential business information?
If your boss is on the ball, she’ll inform you about confidential information.
She’ll give you answers to the following questions:
 Which documents are confidential? Are there degrees of confidentiality?
If so, what are they?
 Are you and your boss the only people who can look at these documents?
If not, who else can look at them?
244
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 
When you won’t break the rules for your boss
When your boss goes after you because you
won’t do something wrong, the following tips
may help:
 Keep a record of all incidents and your
responses when your boss asks you to do
something unethical.
 Keep your records at home. Don’t keep
them at work, where they could be stolen.
 Follow the instructions in the company’s
policies-and-procedures documents (if
your company has them) for combating
unethical behavior.
 Direct your concerns to the human re-
sources department, if your company has
one.
 Look for a new job.

 Do you have the authority to open packages marked “Personal” or
“Confidential”? If not, does anyone other than the addressee have that
authority?
 Should you clear with your boss all requests for confidential materials?
If not, under what conditions can you exercise your own judgment? If so,
what should you do if your boss is unavailable?
 Does anyone have permission to remove things from your boss’s office?
If so, who? If not, how should you handle such requests?
Having this kind of blunt discussion with your boss will show her that you
care about confidentiality and are willing to work to protect it.
If you’re privy to confidential proprietary information, you bear a duty not to
disclose it. This duty requires, among other things, that you learn how to live
with secrets. Learning to live with secrets in turn requires that you be alert 
to what you say in the company of others and that you be alert to others’
attempts to get information from you. Don’t take these duties lightly! Your job
depends on doing them well.
These guidelines can help you:
 Know who’s authorized to discuss confidential matters, and discuss con-
fidential matters only with that person.
 Practice self-control by being the model of discretion in all situations.
 In public, speak softly so that others do not overhear you.
 When you’re asked for confidential information, reply that because it’s
confidential, you can’t divulge it. If the other person persists, politely
point out that he’s out of line. If that doesn’t work, try a blank stare.
 Don’t allow others to read your computer screen or peruse your desk-
top. Put confidential documents face down or in a locked drawer when
you’re not looking at them.
 Don’t tell your spouse or life partner all the details, even if you’re
tempted to do so.
Personal information
The other kind of confidential information that you can gain is personal infor-
mation of an embarrassing sort. Everyone knows that administrative assis-
tants sometimes learn things they would really rather not know about their
bosses, and that bosses sometimes ask employees to report things about col-
leagues that are really none of the boss’s business.
These kinds of breaches are entirely avoidable, but only by those who are
responsible for committing them. Whenever someone else — through what
he says or what he does — discloses something that you would rather not
245
Chapter 18: Managing Ethical Dilemmas at Work

know, you’re placed in a coercive position, in which you either keep the
secret or snitch. Both options are unpleasant.
To keep this kind of situation from happening to you, the first line of defense
is to stop someone from saying something before she says more than you
want to know. You can do this in two ways:
 Distinguish between friendly exchanges of benign information and malig-
nant exchanges of harmful information.
 Ask whether, given your professional relationship, the other person really
wants to give you the information. Most of the time, this tactic prevents
the conversation from going somewhere both of you will regret. Having
avoided the issue, make sure that it never comes up again.
Sometimes, of course, preventive measures don’t work. A colleague may just
blurt something out, or you stumble onto something you shouldn’t see, or
you find yourself overhearing something you shouldn’t hear. In these kinds of
cases, you’re stuck. Through no fault of your own, you know something about
someone that you shouldn’t know. The best general advice is to act as though
you never had that bit of knowledge in the first place. This method isn’t
always easy and won’t always succeed, but at least you’ll have tried to not
act on something you shouldn’t know.
Here’s more advice that can help:
 Ask yourself, “Do I want what I’m about to do to be on videotape?” If the
answer is no, don’t do it.
 If someone discloses confidential information about clients or patients
to you, your best recourse is to keep quiet. If the disclosure continues,
you could consider approaching the other person’s supervisor with the
breach of confidentiality. Correcting the problem is the supervisor’s
responsibility, not yours.
Security
If you read the earlier sections about loyalty and confidentiality, you know
most of what you need to do to ensure that confidential information isn’t
leaked. But I still have a few loose ends to tie up.
Stealing from your company — whether you’re taking a product or some
office supplies — is wrong.
Another serious issue is maintaining the security of hard copy and electronic
documents. Luckily, you can take some straightforward steps:
246
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

 Don’t leave confidential documents unattended on your desk. At a mini-
mum, turn them face down when you leave. Better still, put them in a
locked drawer.
 If you have confidential documents at a meeting, keep them under wraps
until they’re needed. Return them to your briefcase or portfolio as soon
as they are no longer needed.
 When you’re transporting confidential documents anywhere, put them
in an envelope or folder. If you leave the office with them, put them in a
locked briefcase.
 When you mail confidential documents, place them in an envelope
marked “Confidential,” and place that sealed envelope in another enve-
lope also marked “Confidential.” That way, no one can pretend that he
didn’t see the warning.
 Never throw confidential documents away. Shred them.
Your computer support team will no doubt develop security measures to pro-
tect sensitive electronic documents. Various encryption codes, password
procedures, and clearance procedures may already be in place. Follow 
those procedures, and use the codes consistently.
You can also take or recommend additional measures if you think that elec-
tronic security is lax. Ask your manager for suggestions. Information security
is, after all, her responsibility. Talk to the resident information technology
officer about what he does to protect documents, and then recommend that
everyone follow his example.
Here are some ways to protect confidentiality while using computers:
 Remove printouts from shared printers as soon as possible.
 Store document and program disks in a locked drawer.
 Turn your computer off at night.
 Don’t share disks.
 Don’t send confidential documents by e-mail unless you’re certain that
your system is secure.
Mixing Personal Business and Work
In many businesses, the workday is much less structured than it used to be.
Flextime, personal days, home offices, and the conveniences of electronic
devices have worked together to make the 9-to-5 workday a thing of the past
in some companies. Even companies that have rigid structures offer much
more flexibility than before.
247
Chapter 18: Managing Ethical Dilemmas at Work

Additional flexibility in the workday is a huge change and a real boon. But the
flexible workday has introduced some new problems into the business envi-
ronment and exacerbated some existing ones.
For employees, the line between work time and private time has blurred, and
the desire and need to take care of personal business during the workday has
become acute in some cases. If you have a lot of autonomy in structuring your
day, and if you act in a professional manner, mixing private and professional
activities isn’t likely to cause problems. If you don’t have much autonomy, or 
if you allow your personal business to interfere with your real business, you’ll
end up in a bad situation.
Doing personal business on company time
Many employers understand, and even encourage, employees to take enough
time to do short personal errands during the day, so long as they complete
their work. If you’re the manager, you’re responsible for making company
policy clear. Some companies offer electronic concierge services that per-
form personal errands for their employees or arrange for dry cleaning to be
picked up at the office or home. These services are a real boon to employees.
The difficulties introduced by children call for sympathetic managers and
understanding colleagues. If your colleague leaves work early every
Wednesday to take his son to violin practice, that doesn’t mean he’s getting a
perk that you’re not. He may have to compensate by working on the Saturday
that you spend ballooning in New Mexico. This kind of rearranged workweek
is a common feature of the contemporary economic landscape.
In the following sections, I explain how to handle a few personal tasks on
company time.
Personal calls
Abusing phone privileges is a recurring employer complaint. Spending two
minutes talking to your daughter about her pet mouse is fine; spending half
an hour talking to your best friend about your latest round of golf while a
deadline is looming isn’t. Keep personal conversations short and to the point,
especially if you’re in a cubicle. Avoid having screaming arguments with your
spouse.
E-mails
Your work e-mail account is for work-related e-mails. If you want to join chat
rooms or dating services, do so from some other computer (such as the one
you have at home). Also, refrain from sending racy or highly critical (or flam-
ing) e-mails on your business computer. I cover this topic in more detail in
Chapter 9.
248
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

Your e-mail is company property and may be monitored. If your boss finds
questionable e-mail, she may have grounds to discipline or dismiss you.
Computer games
Some people are addicted to computer games. This includes some professional
adults, and this fondness can impinge on work. Don’t let yourself get bug-eyed
and irritable when you realize that you’ve been playing for two hours and that
the Webding report is due this afternoon. If you have to, remove the games
from your work computer and put them where they belong — at home.
Web browsing
In the past ten years, employers have lost untold work hours to employees’
Web browsing. No doubt, looking at the Himalayan Adventure Outfitters Web
site will get you stoked for your next climb in Nepal, but this site probably
can wait until you get to some other computer — such as the one at home.
Also, save your browsing for just the right office coffee mug until you get
home, because that task can take hours. (Believe me, I know!)
At work, your Web browsing should be confined to the personal time that
you’re given. Managers bear responsibility for letting employees know the
expectations. If it’s okay with you for an employee to watch a Sam Donaldson
Webcast on his break, by all means say so. But also say that when break time
is over, it’s time to get back to work.
Finally, I have to say it again: Stay away from porn sites while you’re at work.
If you get caught looking at them, you’ll be in big trouble, and chances are
increasingly good that you will be caught. Employers everywhere are installing
software that tracks the Web sites visited by employees. Is getting a cheap
thrill really worth a dressing-down from your boss? Is it worth your job?
Probably not.
Separating personal space 
and business space
One consequence of the additional flexibility in the workday is that the line
between personal space and professional space is fuzzier now than it has
ever been. There’s no doubt about it — the new casualness has caused more
than a few privacy problems.
Keeping your personal life personal
Taking care of too much personal business on company time is a bad idea.
You also have to be careful about involving your business colleagues in your
personal life.
249
Chapter 18: Managing Ethical Dilemmas at Work

No specific rule governs how much of your personal life to reveal to your col-
leagues and your employer. You can divulge it all if you’re comfortable doing
so. But remember that some people would rather not know about your latest
Atlantic City escapade. Most people are better off not knowing how much you
hate your ex-wife. Also, what you divulge today could come back to haunt
you tomorrow.
Keep in mind that your lifestyle can become relevant to your employer if that
lifestyle has a negative impact on your performance. If you publicize your
long tradition of leaving work and getting drunk every Friday while you’re
still in uniform, you could be called into your boss’s office to hear a lecture
on the virtues of sobriety and the importance of being a good company 
representative at all times.
Some personal issues probably are best kept from colleagues and supervi-
sors. Your family’s health history, for example, is nobody’s business at the
office. If you are rash enough to tell someone that the men in your family
have a history of prostate cancer, you shouldn’t be surprised when the
human resources person asks you about it one day while she’s filling out an
insurance questionnaire. And if you’re vain enough to tell your supervisor
that your uncle is Bill Gates, you shouldn’t be shocked when he tells you that
he has a great idea for Microsoft; he just needs your help setting up a quick
interview with your uncle.
Keeping your professional life professional
Just as keeping some of your private life away from the office is wise, keeping
some of your professional life away from your private life is also wise. Your
romantic partner doesn’t need to know everything about petty office politics
to know that you’re stressed in your job. And if you have business informa-
tion that you can tell your friends or your romantic partner only by violating
client confidentiality or company policy, you’re obligated not to tell.
Not telling your closest friends or your romantic partner something can be
very hard. Psychiatrists, physicians, and lawyers face this dilemma on a regu-
lar basis. A sympathetic friend or romantic partner will acknowledge the diffi-
culties entailed by professional codes of conduct and won’t pry. Pressing for
personal information from someone who’s bound to professional confiden-
tiality may cause the end of the relationship.
Violating client confidentiality is grounds for dismissal in some professions
and grounds for expulsion from some professional organizations.
Drawing the line between the personal and the professional
Not only are there things about you that your colleagues don’t need to know,
but there also are some things about you that no one at your workplace has
any right to know. Your political views, for example, are irrelevant in the vast
majority of business situations. So are your religious beliefs, your ethnic
250
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

background, your family’s lifestyle, your sexual orientation, and your hob-
bies. And although your moral values may be pertinent, try to keep the dog-
matic elements out of your workday environment.
Here’s some advice to keep in mind:
 No one at work is entitled to know everything about you. If someone
asks you to reveal a private matter, just say, “I prefer to keep my private
life private, thank you.”
 If someone persists in asking impertinent questions despite your
repeated refusal to answer them, report the matter to a supervisor.
 If your supervisor is the one who won’t let up on the impertinent ques-
tions, report the matter to her supervisor.
Saying “No” and Maybe — Just 
Maybe — Keeping Your Job
Some ethical dilemmas come not from your taking advantage of your employer,
but from your employer taking advantage of you. These problems are tough
because you’re no longer in control. If you routinely browse the Web while
you’re at work, you can change that situation. But if the owner of the company
asks you to falsify employee records to avoid paying Social Security taxes,
you’re no longer in control. Not only is the request unethical, but also, it’s com-
bined with the implicit threat that if you won’t do it, you won’t have a job.
This situation is a classic professional dilemma. Millions of workers face vari-
ations on it every year. Your success or failure in dealing with situations like
this depends more on your tact, diplomacy, and good manners than on any-
thing else.
First, try to defuse the situation by giving the other person the option of
retracting the request or demand. Try one of the following methods:
 Repeat the request. Say, “Let me make sure that I heard you correctly.
You would like me to misreport our earnings this quarter. Is that correct?”
 Give the other person a blank stare.
 Say nothing.
 Say, “I’m not sure I heard that.”
 Say, “I’m sorry. Let’s look for another solution.”
 Say, “Excuse me a minute. I’m going to go for a drink of water. When I get
back, we can start over.”
251
Chapter 18: Managing Ethical Dilemmas at Work

The aim of all these maneuvers is to get the person who’s making the improper
request to think twice and retract that request.
These techniques won’t always work. You may face a choice: Go along with
the unethical request and compromise yourself in the process, or refuse to
go along with it and face the consequences.
It’s almost always in your self-interest and in the interest of your company to
refuse an unethical request from another employee.
If you stand by your refusal, no doubt you will face some criticism and some
discrimination from the person who made the request or demand. He may
brand you as being disloyal or not a team player. Let him do so. Others will
notice when you’re being persecuted for no apparent reason, and more often
than not, they’ll guess what happened.
You may lose your job. That outcome is unlikely, but it does happen. Most of
the time, the only result will be that the other person tries to get someone
else to go along. Maybe she’ll find a co-conspirator; maybe she won’t. But you
won’t be going along for the long tumble out of the company that she’s likely
to take when her shenanigans are discovered — as they probably will be.
You could face lots of other ethical dilemmas at work that aren’t covered in

omantic attraction is a fact of life, so it’s a fact of professional life.
Sometimes, though, the attraction is one-way rather than mutual, or the
romantic attention is forced instead of consensual. In the workplace, either
situation can come coupled with unequal power, leading to sexual harass-
ment. Although never condoned by company policy, sexual harassment
occurs in the workplace with frightening regularity.
Most of the time, romantic attraction is mutual or at least consensual. But
you may have plenty of reasons not to let others know about a romance, not
the least of which is that you may not know whether it’s going to work out.
Unfortunately, no secret is more likely to be exposed and become the subject
of gossip than a romance. Few office romances remain under wraps for long,
and when they’re exposed, trouble sometimes follows.
In this chapter, I cover what sexual harassment is, how to avoid it, and what
to do if you encounter it. I also give you a few pointers for handling office flir-
tations and romances.

Defining and Avoiding Sexual
Harassment
Sexual harassment in the workplace is considered to be an expression of
intimidation and perceived power by one person over another and can be a
threat to a victim’s job. The behavior creates an offensive and hostile envi-
ronment, which interferes with the victim’s work performance. Sexual harass-
ment can be described as any unwelcome physical, visual, or verbal sexual
advance; it also can be a request for sexual favors. The following sections
cover what constitutes sexual harassment and how you can avoid it.
Defining sexual harassment
A difference exists between office flirting and romance on the one hand and
sexual harassment on the other. Flirting is sometimes annoying, and
romances are sometimes forbidden by company policy, but sexual harass-
ment is always illegal.
Even today, after sexual-harassment laws have been on the books for more
than 40 years, many people are uncertain and confused about what sexual
harassment actually is. Many companies have mandatory sexual-harassment
seminars for all employees. If you’re not in such a company or haven’t yet
attended one of these seminars, here is a definition of sexual harassment
derived from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Sexual harassment occurs whenever:
 Someone promises you a job or a promotion in return for sexual favors.
 You are demoted or fired for refusing to comply with a request for sex.
 You are explicitly required to engage in certain sexual behavior to get or
keep a job.
 Someone else’s sexual behavior creates a hostile or abusive work envi-
ronment that changes the conditions of your job.
There are three kinds of sexual harassment: quid pro quo, the creation of a
hostile workplace, and explicit harassment. The following sections describe
them in detail.
Quid-pro-quo harassment
The first kind of sexual harassment is by far the easiest to understand. It’s
quid pro quo (this for that), in which one person — usually, a man in a posi-
tion of authority — asks another person — usually, a woman in a subordinate
position — to provide sexual favors in return for a job or a promotion.
254
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

Although male-to-female harassment is the most common form of quid-pro-
quo harassment, it’s not the only kind. Gays, lesbians, and transgendered
individuals increasingly face sexual harassment as well, and more men are
facing sexual harassment from women as women climb to positions of power.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC’s) Sexual
Harassment Charges Web page (www.eeoc.gov/stats/harass.html)
states that in fiscal year 2006, the agency received 12,025 charges of sexual
harassment, 15.4 percent of which were filed by males. The EEOC resolved
11,936 sexual-harassment charges in 2006 and recovered $48.8 million in ben-
efits for the plaintiffs and other aggrieved parties (not including monetary
benefits obtained through litigation).
Quid-pro-quo harassment has a long history, having long been a favorite
practice of people in positions of authority. But it’s wrong, and you don’t
have to comply with it. Period. (I explain later in this chapter how to confront
sexual harassment.)
The creation of a hostile work environment
The category of harassment that’s most difficult to pin down is a hostile work
environment. In recent legal cases, findings showed that unwanted touching
or flirting, nude pictures of men or women, lewd gestures or comments, and
certain comments about appearance or dress all rise to the level of creating a
hostile work environment; therefore, they qualify as instances of sexual
harassment.
A female employee of a municipal utility company told a dirty joke to a male
coworker. The male coworker was not offended, but another employee
passing them in the hallway overheard the joke and was offended. She
claimed that the two people in question had a practice of exchanging dirty
jokes within earshot of other employees. Despite her protests to them, she
claimed that they continued the practice. Management sided with the
offended employee and placed formal reprimands in both of the other
employees’ files. Subsequently, both were denied promotions.
The ribald camaraderie that used to exist among many men in male-
dominated workplaces is a thing of the past. The old-boy practices of telling
dirty jokes and pinching secretaries are, like racist comments, strictly out of
place in today’s workplace.
Explicitly stated sexual harassment
The third kind of sexual harassment rises above the other two forms in severity.
A supervisor might hint that sexual favors will be rewarded with a promotion,
for example. But if the quid pro quo is made explicit, the matter rises to the
third level of harassment, and you need to turn it over to another supervisor or
the human resources department immediately.
255
Chapter 19: Handling Sexuality in the Workplace

If you’re a woman working in a mechanic’s shop, and a fellow mechanic has a
couple of pinups posted on the wall next to his workstation, that display
probably rises only to the level of creating a hostile work environment. If you
walk into work one day, however, and find the walls of your workstation liber-
ally plastered with offensive pictures, the conditions of your job have
changed materially. That situation qualifies as harassment rising to the
actionable level.
Avoiding sexual harassment
Pretty clearly, you don’t want to work in a hostile environment or in an office
where the managers think that having their pick of the latest recruits is an
executive perk. How, then, do you avoid harassment?
Supervisors and managers set the tone of the workplace, so the first respon-
sibility is theirs. If your manager makes it clear that sexual harassment won’t
be tolerated, you’re lucky. He may allow some frivolity, but he should state
explicitly that predatory behavior won’t be tolerated. If he doesn’t, you may
have no choice but to go over his head.
Other tips for avoiding harassment include the following:
 Conduct yourself professionally at all times. If you treat others courte-
ously and professionally, and make no sly allusions to sexual matters,
chances are good that you’ll be treated the same way.
 Take care with your appearance. Women should avoid clothes,
makeup, and accessories that send sexual messages, such as heavy
mascara, plunging necklines, supershort skirts, and nosebleed high
heels. Men should avoid tight pants and muscle shirts. (See Chapter 4
for guidelines on creating an appropriate work wardrobe.)
 Remember that some people’s personalities change when they travel.
During business trips, avoid meeting other people in hotel rooms, and
leave bars and restaurants if your colleagues are clearly more interested
in getting drunk than in relaxing after a hard day. (See Chapter 13 for
details on behaving properly during special events.)
 Keep your ears open to rumors about sexual harassers. Rumors often
are unreliable, but if you keep hearing the same thing about the same
supervisor, you’d be wise to check out the rumor with the human
resources department and — if it’s verified — to stay away from private
encounters with that supervisor.
 Check to see that your company has developed a sexual-harassment
policy. If so, ask that the company provide information on what the
policy covers and whether it’s effective.
 Don’t discuss your sex life at work. “Don’t ask, don’t tell” applies to
everyone.
256
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

Confronting Sexual Harassment
Your attempts to avoid sexual harassment won’t always work. If you’re being
harassed, you’re entitled to protection. Unfortunately, taking that protection
before you give the harasser an opportunity to change her behavior instantly
brands you as a troublemaker. So the first thing to do if you’re being harassed
is to confront the harasser as politely as you can. Tell her that the behavior is
unwanted and unappreciated, and that you want it to stop.
If the behavior is a simple misunderstanding, telling the harasser to stop
ought to do the trick. But this technique won’t work in plenty of cases.
Suppose that you’re in the boss’s office, and no witnesses are around. Telling
him that his advances are unwelcome may not deter him. In such a case, you
have no alternative but to leave his office as soon as you can, with as much
dignity as possible. As soon as you get back to your desk, write down the
date of the harassment and what happened. Take it home. Keep it there. He
may never harass you again, but if he does, you’ll be keeping a record of it.
Here are some additional guidelines for confronting harassment:
 Keep — at home — records of all incidents of harassment. Don’t keep
them at work, where they could be stolen.
 If your company has policies-and-procedures documents, follow their
instructions for combating harassment.
 Direct your concerns to the human resources department.
 Get counseling and support as soon as possible from someone you can
trust. Sexual harassment has a huge impact on your emotional and phys-
ical well-being.
 Don’t ignore harassment, hoping that it will go away. It won’t.
If you feel unsafe, or if the harasser is threatening you or trying to discredit
you and your job performance, filing formal charges may be your only option.
In such a case, contact the EEOC (www.eeoc.gov) or the National
Organization of Women (www.now.org). Both organizations can help you
determine whether your case is strong enough to pursue and, if so, how you
should pursue it.
If you love your job, love working for the company, and want to stay there,
don’t let yourself be intimidated by the prospects of filing a harassment
charge. Sexual-harassment charges aren’t to be undertaken frivolously or
under false pretenses, of course, but don’t avoid them out of fear if they’re
well founded.
In filing a harassment charge, you have to rely on your supervisor to set the
tone. Your supervisor’s responsibilities are twofold: ensuring that you’re
treated fairly and neutrally, and ensuring that the person you’re charging is
257
Chapter 19: Handling Sexuality in the Workplace

treated fairly and neutrally. Fulfilling this dual duty is one of the hardest
things a supervisor has to do, but it’s essential if the people involved are to
avoid premature vilification. If your supervisor is the one doing the harass-
ing, you really have no choice: You have to report her to her supervisor.
Having said all that, I must also say that levying charges against others can
have a negative impact on you. You not only have the burden of proof in any
legal proceedings, but you also must bear the burden of being thought a dis-
loyal rabble-rouser by some of your coworkers.
 The legal burden is hard to bear: You must prove that you were treated
worse than others, that the harassment was intentional, and that the
only reason for the employment decision was your refusal to accept the
quid pro quo. That’s a lot to prove.
 The social burden is worse: Some of your colleagues will ostracize you.
Bringing a sexual-harassment suit against a coworker or a superior also
could result in your being fired on trumped-up charges.
As hard as it is to bring to light, sexual harassment cannot be tolerated. If you
file a sexual-harassment charge, tough it out. You’re doing the right thing!
Having a Romantic Relationship 
with Someone from Work
Romances happen in the workplace on a regular basis. Statistics show that
almost half of all marriages are between people who met at work. Usually,
everything works out: The lovebirds work comfortably with each other, and
they live happily ever after. Occasionally, however, things don’t work out: The
dating couple is embarrassingly gushy at work; they sneak off for long
lunches; they bring their personal troubles to work; or one of them promotes
the other unfairly.
Flirting
Flirting is harmless unless the person you’re flirting with doesn’t want to be
the recipient. But as you know by the time you’re old enough to work, you
don’t begin a work relationship by flirting. You begin a relationship at work
professionally, getting to know the person on a professional basis first. If
he’s single and you’re single, and you think that your interest in him won’t
be rebuffed immediately, it’s perfectly all right to ask him out for a drink
after work.
258
Part IV: Overcoming Work-Related Challenges 

If he says no and is not obviously disappointed that he can’t make it, let the
matter go. If, on the other hand, he seems disappointed that he can’t accept,
suggest that you reschedule for some other time. If he jumps at the opportu-
nity, you’ll know that your attraction to him is reciprocated.
If you’re not interested in someone else’s flirtations, you can inform the flirter
of that fact by ignoring the suggestive remarks or by telling the truth: that
you’re not interested in having any relationship other than a professional
one. Both strategies have risks, however. If you try ignoring flirtation, the
other person may think only that you’re obtuse and may increase the voltage;
if you tell the truth, feelings may get hurt. Such is the stuff of adult life.
The best advice I have is simple: Try always to take the other person’s feel-
ings into account when you deliberate about what to do with an unwanted
flirtation. If you end up hurting someone’s feelings despite your best efforts
otherwise, accept the situation and move on.
Dating
When you’re dating someone in the office, remember two things: Check the
company’s dating policy, and keep your public displays of affection out of
the office.
Also keep this advice in mind:
 If your company permits dating among coworkers and doesn’t require
disclosure, you’re under no obligation to disclose an office romance.
Some people prefer to keep their private lives completely separate from
their professional lives. If the relationship looks as though it’s going to
last, however, you’d be polite to inform your supervisor.
 If your company doesn’t permit dating, you keep either your job or the
romance — or try to keep both by keeping the romance a secret. Know
ahead of time, however, that the latter strategy probably will fail.
 If your company permits dating, but only on the condition that you dis-
close it to the appropriate person (a supervisor or someone in human
resources), comply with the policy as soon as you can.
Having an office romance is thrilling. Anticipating the evening during the day
can lead some people to distraction, however, and if distraction isn’t curbed,
it can result in embarrassment and even the loss of your job. Beware! Your
excitement may be contagious to your loved one, but it’s best ignored during
the workday. Otherwise, you may find yourself out on the street after sending
your lover a saucy memo. Remember these points:
259
Chapter 19: Handling Sexuality in the Workplace

 Closet and office trysts are mighty risky and will get you fired if they’re
discovered.
 Racy e-mails, like all other e-mails, are the property of the company.
Problematic romances
Many companies discourage romances between people of unequal rank. The
reasons are obvious. People will suspect (and may be correct to suspect)
that any promotion or special treatment of the person of lower rank is a
result of the romantic relationship with the person of higher rank. And if the
romance goes sour, there’s simply too much risk that the person of higher
rank will make life miserable for the person of lower rank. No company wants
to put itself at risk of a sexual-harassment suit resulting from a failed
romance.
Therefore, most companies require that relationships between superiors and
subordinates be disclosed immediately, usually by the person in the position
of power. (See the preceding section for more about disclosure.) In most
cases, that disclosure immediately results in the superior’s being taken out of
the subordinate’s evaluation loop. Another common consequence is that one
of the two parties — usually, the subordinate one — is transferred to a differ-
ent job.
One other problematic romance is that between a company representative
and a client or customer. Take care that your romantic involvement with a
client or customer doesn’t entangle you in a conflict of interest in which you
give the client preferential treatment because of the personal relationship
between the two of you. In cases like this, you should ask to be reassigned
rather than risk embarrassment and possible legal action.

usiness travel doesn’t have to be drudgery, and although some stress is
inevitable, it doesn’t have to make you miserable. The key is knowing
that in all probability, something will go wrong: Your hotel will be next to a
construction site, your luggage will be lost, your flight will be canceled, or
you’ll forget your favorite shoes.
Good travelers are ready for the unexpected. They take the inconveniences in
stride, cope with the disasters, and are amused when something goes wrong
in a way that they might really be able to laugh about later. In this chapter,
you find out what it takes to be a good traveler.
Planning Your Trip
Your job may take you all over the city, country, or world. If you travel on a
regular basis, you eventually learn what all good travelers learn: On the road,
being self-reliant and having a routine are essential. Planning your itinerary,
packing the essentials, and having a familiar routine help you cope better
with the inevitable onslaught of new and unfamiliar people, places, and
information.

Preparing your itinerary
When you travel, you may be making your own plans, relying on the in-house
travel department, or using an agency.
You can begin to guarantee a good business trip by planning it as soon as you
know the dates of the trip. Car rentals, airline tickets, train reservations, and
hotel rooms don’t get any cheaper the longer you wait, and they don’t
become more available. So get on the ball. Don’t rely completely on your
company’s overwhelmed travel agent, either; some Internet research on your
part may help.
When you’re planning the dates of a business trip, either nationally or inter-
nationally, consider religious and local holidays, as businesses and restau-
rants could be closed. And don’t forget about midsummer European
vacations and spring break!
After you’ve made your travel and accommodation arrangements, put
together an itinerary. In this itinerary, list the following:
 Flight information (flight numbers, departure and arrival times, depar-
ture and arrival cities, airline name, and airline telephone number)
 Ground-transportation information (such as car-rental agency name,
telephone number, and reservation number; or limousine confirmation)
 Hotel name, address, telephone number, and reservation number
 Meeting times and places, with telephone numbers if possible
 Host names, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses
 Meal arrangements (research a few key cuisines and restaurants ahead
of time)
 Scheduled entertainment
Give a copy of your itinerary to your supervisor or assistant, and give
another copy to a friend or relative. If something goes wrong, and you don’t
arrive back when you say you will, someone will be able to initiate a search
with accurate information about you.
Packing what you need
The rules are simple: Pack what you’ll need, and leave everything else at
home. You have to take your laptop, cell phone, PDA, reports, contracts,
brochures, clothes, shaving kit or cosmetic bag, and vintage cowboy boots.
Oops — leave that last item at home (unless they fit into your carry-on bag
264
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

and you really like them). Don’t forget your medication and your lens pre-
scriptions if you wear glasses or contact lenses.
The key to packing travel clothing is keeping it simple, lightweight, and wrin-
kle free. You can achieve the first goal by taking no more than two changes of
clothes per day; try to recycle clothes, if you can. To achieve the second goal
easily, leave your heavyweights — the overcoat and ballroom gown — at home.
And to achieve the third goal, take as many no-wrinkle items as possible.
Don’t forget to take clothes for evenings and outings. If you’re in doubt about
what to bring, ask your host. Don’t assume that because your company has
casual Friday, the company you’re visiting next Friday has one too. Ask your
host whether his office has casual dress on Fridays.
Take a credit card with an open balance and cash if you’ll be in a rural area.
You may also want to bring traveler’s checks. If you’re on a business expense
account, it’s essential to keep precise records. If you have a laptop, consider
using an accounting program showing all expenses, or keep an expense book
with handwritten records and use it assiduously. Keep all receipts in a safe
place. (See Chapter 18 for more about expense reports.)
If you’re going overseas, be sure to have enough currency from your destina-
tion country to pay for small expenses before you get a chance to go to a
hotel’s or bank’s exchange window. Also, ask your bank or host whether your
ATM card is going to work for getting your destination currency at the hotel
where you’ll be staying or at a nearby bank.
Avoid exchanging money at airports. Airport exchange windows are more
expensive than money exchanges at hotels or banks. You also can seek out
independent money exchangers for a better rate.
No matter where you go, take identification that allows you to drive. You
need your driver’s license to board a flight, and you also may need it for addi-
tional ID when you’re traveling. If you are a frequent overseas traveler, con-
sider getting an international driver’s license; it’s quick and easy to obtain.
For information on how to obtain an international driver’s license or permit,
visit the U.S. Department of Transportation at ntl.bts.gov/faq/
intdl.html or the U.S. Department of State at travel.state.gov/
travel/abroad_roadsafety.html#permits.
If you’re traveling out of the country, double-check the expiration date on
your passport. Renewing an expired passport can take weeks, and although
you can rush the process, the fees are much higher. Also, some countries
require that your passport be valid at least six months beyond the dates of
your trip. Check with the nearest embassy or consulate of each country you
plan to visit to find out that country’s entry and visa requirements. For com-
plete details, ask for information at any U.S. Postal Service office that issues
passports, or visit www.usps.com/passport.
265
Chapter 20: Pack Your Manners! Traveling for Business

Traveling with your electronic tools
If you’re like many professionals today, you own several beeping, blinking,
ringing, buzzing, and/or musical plastic-encased gadgets that keep you con-
nected to work, home, and all the information you need while you’re on the
road. These days, many busy people carry a phone, laptop, and PDA at the
same time. Although these devices are useful, they can contribute to a clut-
tered, disorganized — and, therefore, unprofessional — look.
How can you survive on the road without these tools? One option is to con-
solidate gadgetry. Many phone/PDA combinations are available now, and
more are sure to come. Also, most cell phones have numerous features that
store phone numbers; allow text-messaging; and provide calendars, naviga-
tional tools, Internet and e-mail access, and digital cameras so that you can
leave other gadgets behind.
When traveling with electronic devices, keep these tips in mind:
 Carry more than one electrical adaptor and converter to accommodate
charging more than one device at a time.
 If you’re carrying a laptop computer, try placing your bag on a wheeled
carrier to get it through the airport instead of carrying it in your hand or
over your shoulder. Specially designed laptop bags also work well, and
some of them can be converted to regular briefcases for meetings.
 Airport security officials will ask you to turn off your laptop and other
electronic gadgets. Comply pleasantly with their requests. After all,
they’re just doing their job, which is to keep you safe.
 Never talk on a cell phone while the flight attendant reviews safety
information. In fact, you shouldn’t talk at all during this presentation.
Although you may be a seasoned traveler, other passengers may need to
hear this potentially lifesaving information.
 If you’re using your laptop on the plane, watch your elbows, especially if
you’re in the dreaded middle seat. If your typing causes you to intrude
on other passengers’ precious personal space, don’t type. You won’t be
able to get much done while they’re glaring at you anyway.
 If you have long fingernails, they may click on the keyboard while you’re
typing — a noise that can be extremely annoying to the passengers
around you. If the clicking is unavoidable, you may want to check with
those sitting near you to see whether they object.
266
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

Practicing Good Manners 
When You Travel By Air
Airline travel has never been more convenient (in theory) or more harried (in
practice) than in the past few years. Pilots, staff, and ground crew are all
stressed, which sometimes translates into rudeness and anxiety.
Most airport employees are trying hard to do their jobs, often under far-from-
ideal circumstances. Weather, late connecting flights, problems at other air-
ports, increased security, layoffs, consolidations, and labor disputes conspire
to make flights late and people exasperated. In the following sections, I give
you some guidance on how to keep your cool while you fly.
Following new security policies
In the constantly changing world of air travel, knowing just what to expect is
impossible. If you haven’t been to an airport recently, you need to update
yourself on the latest airport security rules from the Transportation Security
Administration (TSA). Travelers face tighter security and longer lines
because of strict TSA regulations on carry-on items and required forms of ID.
A little preparation, patience, and manners are required (along with a good
deal of humor). No one is immune from scrutiny, so do your part to keep the
skies safe.
Here are some guidelines:
 Be sure that your electronic devices are charged before you get to the
airport. As you go through airport security, you could be asked to power
up the devices to prove that they are what they seem to be.
 Empty your pockets of keys, loose change, pens, and other metal
objects. Be prepared to remove your jewelry and your belt. If you’re
asked to remove items such as your shoes, do so graciously. Above all,
keep your cool. Remember, this screening is for your safety and that of
others.
 If possible, pay for your tickets with a credit card. Passengers who pay
with cash are more likely to be pulled aside by security.
 Before you leave, know what is permitted and not permitted in your
carry-on and checked luggage. To learn the latest rules and require-
ments, visit www.tsa.gov or www.dhs.gov/xtrvlsec.
 Never offer to watch someone else’s luggage, and don’t ask anyone else
to watch yours. Doing so not only puts you in an awkward situation, but
also involves a big security risk. Always keep your bags with you, and
never carry anything onto the plane for someone else.
267
Chapter 20: Pack Your Manners! Traveling for Business

Planning well
As a traveler, you expect the airport to be efficient and the flight to go
smoothly. Do yourself a favor: Modify your thinking. Be prepared for a flight
that’s delayed or an airline that loses your baggage. Being prepared means
avoiding scheduling meetings within two or three hours of your arrival, and
having enough money and food on your person that you can survive if the
plane gets in after all the local banks, restaurants, and stores have closed. It
means carrying all your luggage with you onto the plane, or at least carrying
a bag with a change of clothes and your essential toiletries.
Have a reasonable checklist of information you want to bring on board, such
as a backup airline schedule, a calendar for rescheduling flights or meetings,
your itinerary, and your hotel and client phone numbers.
Double-check the number of pieces, size, and weight allowed for your carry-
on and checked luggage. Be sure that the luggage will fit smaller carry-on
limits, even when the suitcase is completely stuffed.
Staying calm and respectful
Air travel is stressful, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, some people seem not
to be able to handle stress without lashing out. Everyone who has been in an
airport or on an airplane probably has seen someone lose it at the check-in
desk or on the plane. If you can’t control your temper when you’re stressed
out, do what you can to prevent the conditions in which you get stressed.
Confirm your reservation and seat number ahead of time. Get to the airport
early. Most airlines require up to three hours of preboarding time for people
traveling out of the country and two hours for people traveling nationally. To
save time, take advantage of preprinting your own boarding pass from home
within 24 hours of your flight time. Avoid the luggage check-in line by carry-
ing your luggage. Avoid sugar; eat something with protein in it. Drink enough
water. Take your medication. Breathe.
After the plane is in the air, you probably will be served drinks and may even
be served food. Here, as much as anywhere, good table manners are in order
(see Chapter 12 for details). Try to adhere to standard table manners as
much as your tiny space allows. If you’re lucky enough to be on a flight with
food service, and you have dietary restrictions or preferences, you may want
to request a special meal (such as vegetarian or kosher) when you book your
ticket.
Keep these tips in mind when dealing with fellow passengers:
268
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

 At least nod and say “Hello” to your rowmates. You don’t have to carry
on a conversation if you don’t want to, but it is polite to acknowledge
others, especially in such tight quarters.
 Ask your neighbor whether working on your laptop computer will
bother her.
 Keep your work off your neighbor’s lap and tray.
 Occupy one armrest at a time. Spreading your arms and elbows across
both armrests is rude.
 Be considerate to airline attendants, and thank them — and the pilots —
when you deplane.
Avoid making these mistakes:
 Wearing heavy cologne or fragrance (but please shower before you
leave!).
 Cutting in any line.
 Crushing or relocating other people’s belongings in an overhead bin to
accommodate your own baggage.
 Talking or laughing too loudly.
 Talking on and on to the person next to you while he’s trying to work,
read, or sleep.
 Grabbing the seat back in front of you when you’re getting up from your
seat. If doing so is unavoidable, let the person in front of you know
ahead of time (and make sure that you don’t pull his hair).
For the consideration of those around you, if you’re on a long flight and you
must remove your jacket and shoes, be sure that you have clean clothes and
deodorant on and have clean socks with you. Sitting next to a passenger with
body odor or stinky feet isn’t too pleasant.
On the Road Again: Using Public and
Private Transportation When You Arrive
When you arrive at your destination, you need to get from the airport to the
hotel and check in at the hotel. If you’ve budgeted for them, hired cars or
taxis are a convenient way to go. But be aware that taxi lines at busy airports
are often very long. If you’re in a hurry and are sufficiently familiar with the
public transportation system, you may be able to shave time off your trip
from the airport to the hotel by taking the subway or an express bus.
269
Chapter 20: Pack Your Manners! Traveling for Business

Keep these tips about taxis and public transportation in mind:
 If a dispatcher is available, let her get the cab. If your host has met you
at the airport, and lots of cabs are around, the host hails; if cabs are
scarce, both host and guest hail.
 The host or driver typically invites the guest to get in first curbside. If
there are three or more people, the tallest or the heaviest sits in front.
The host either gets into the back seat of the car from the street side or
sits in the front passenger seat.
 Chief executive officers and other bigwigs rarely carry cash. If you’re
traveling with your superiors, be prepared to pay the bills.
 Be courteous to the driver, even if he snarls back at you. If so, continue
to be polite but give a smaller tip.
Most taxi drivers are perfectly nice people. Some aren’t. Always have
your wits about you when taking a taxi, and don’t let anyone take advan-
tage of you. For details on traveling by taxi abroad, see Chapter 21.
 On public transportation, you may ask people to move items on an
otherwise-available seat so that you can sit.
 On public transportation, it is polite for both men and women to give up
their seats to older people or people with disabilities if they aren’t dis-
abled themselves. Men should give up seats to women.
Whatever your destination and means of travel, if you know that taxis are
hard to come by, prearrange a dependable car service. It’s worth spending
the few extra dollars to avoid the aggravation of waiting in the queue or hail-
ing a cab. When you or your host hires a car, you can count on the driver to
meet you at the arranged location, usually holding a little sign with your
name or your company’s name.
If you hire a limousine or sedan, remember that, as with taxis, the best seat is
the rear seat closer to the curb, so that’s where a Very Important Person
goes. If you’re a personal assistant or an associate sales representative for
the company, you go in the jump seat or up front with the driver.
Here are a couple of additional tips for riding in a private car:
 Refer to a limousine as a sedan or a car, not a limo.
 If the car has been hired for you, you don’t tip the driver unless she
does something special for you, such as lugging your sample cases up
four flights of stairs.

Knowing the Ins and Outs of Hotels
Most business people stay in commercial hotels, which are designed specifi-
cally for business travelers. They are less expensive than luxury hotels,
because commercial hotels have fewer services.
This isn’t to say that commercial hotels have no services. You can rely on
commercial hotels to have meeting and conference rooms, computers, fax
machines, copiers, and other business amenities. These hotels also have
concierge desks, where you can get advice on things to do in town, look at
menus from selected restaurants, purchase tickets for local entertainment,
and make car-rental or child-care arrangements.
When you know what kind of hotel you’re staying in, you’ll know how many
dollar bills you’re likely to dispose of before you get a chance to lie down on
your bed. Commercial hotels rarely have the staff of a luxury hotel. You’re
likely to find a maid and a concierge at a commercial hotel. But at a luxury
hotel, you’ll also find valets, door attendants, porters, bellhops, sometimes
elevator and bathroom attendants, dry cleaners, tailors, and shoe-shiners.
Here are my tips on tipping:
 Door attendant hails a cab: $1
 Door attendant carries your bag: $1 per bag
 Bellhop arrives at your room with your luggage: $1 or $2 per bag
 Parking valet retrieves your car: $1 or $2
 Maid cleans the room: $2 per night
 Concierge shows you a map of the downtown area: no tip
 Concierge gets you into the wildly popular restaurant you’ve heard so
much about: $10 to $20
 Concierge gets you and your colleague tickets for opening night of an
eagerly awaited opera production: $20 per ticket
When you’re at the hotel, check in, find your room, and take a breather. If
your host has done his job correctly and your flight was on time, you won’t
have to be anywhere for at least a few hours. Take the time to have some-
thing to eat, exercise, snooze, or prepare for your meetings.
Traveling with Colleagues
Traveling with colleagues, especially those you like, can add immeasurably to
your trip. Conversely, traveling with those you merely tolerate or those you
dislike can turn a pleasant trip into something trying.
271
Chapter 20: Pack Your Manners! Traveling for Business

You and your colleagues don’t become friends just because you sit next to
each other on a plane or share a hotel room. Sharing close spaces creates an
opportunity to share other things as well, but you don’t really want your col-
league to know that you sleep with a stuffed monkey, do you? Probably not.
Leave it at home. And you would be better off back at the office if you remain
the model of discretion even as your colleague blathers on and on about her
childhood pets after one too many in the hotel bar.
You may be tempted to go everywhere with your colleague when you’re in a
strange town, but your insecurity isn’t an excuse to do something you proba-
bly wouldn’t do at home. That means if your colleague wants to visit friends,
you don’t have to tag along just because you’re lonely. And it means that if
your colleague wants to go to a bar or find entertainment for the evening, you
don’t have to tag along just because you have nothing else to do.
If you’re thinking about sharing a hotel room, find out ahead of time whether
your colleague snores or walks in his sleep. Both situations can be unnerving
and can lead to the loss of a good night’s sleep. Make other arrangements if
necessary — but be polite. If your colleague doesn’t volunteer that he snores,
you can ask, “Are there any reasons why we should get separate rooms?”
Staying Safe: A Special Word 
for Women Travelers
Differences still exist in appropriate behavior and dress for businessmen and
businesswomen around the world. Sadly, women are also advised to be on
guard for their own safety while traveling, either in the United States or
internationally.
In the past and depending on the country, you may have had no reason to be
afraid when traveling in a foreign country. Unfortunately, times have changed.
Being open to new experiences and meeting new people are part of making
yourself a successful international businessperson. On the other hand,
although travelers of both genders should always be aware of their surround-
ings, women do need to be slightly more cautious.
This section isn’t intended to scare you but to remind you of ways to keep
yourself safe at all times while still having an enjoyable and productive trip.
Even if you’re a guy, reading this section can’t hurt.
If you ever feel unsafe, there’s probably a good reason. Follow your intuition,
and do something to address your fear: Change your route, get into a taxi, go
into a shop where lots of people are, or get off the elevator at the next floor if
someone is making you uncomfortable. Don’t let anyone tell you that you’re
being silly or overreacting.
272
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

Being safe at hotels
Safe travel begins during the planning process back home. If you’re at all con-
cerned about taking a taxi in your destination country, you or your travel
agent should arrange for a car service to pick you up at the airport and take
you to your hotel. Your peace of mind is worth the extra expense. (I discuss
transportation from the airport earlier in this chapter.)
Your choice of hotel is also important, because your hotel is your home away
from home, and you should feel comfortable there. A larger hotel that caters
to business travelers probably will be safer than a smaller hotel. At least on
your first trip to a place, until you become more comfortable there, you
should err on the side of safety. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:
 The hotel should have a bellhop on duty at all hours to assist you with
hailing a taxi or finding your way. Tip generously to ensure attentive ser-
vice throughout your stay.
 When you’re checking into the hotel, other guests shouldn’t be standing
close enough to hear your conversation. Many hotels will write your
room number on the key envelope instead of saying it out loud. If some-
one at the front desk ever says your room number loudly enough that
others can hear it, explain that you would like that information to be
kept private and ask for another room assignment.
 Especially in a large hotel, ask for a room near the elevator so that you
won’t have to walk down a long hallway by yourself. Also avoid rooms
on the first floor.
 Find your key while you’re in the lobby, and keep it in your hand while
you walk to your room. Having it in your hand prevents you from having
to fumble for it in your purse while standing in front of your door.
 If you’re nervous for any reason about walking to your room, ask for an
escort. Again, generous tipping will ensure service with a smile.
 When you get to your room, lock the door immediately, and don’t open
it without looking through the peephole first. If someone claims to be from
room service, but you haven’t ordered anything, don’t open the door.
 If you’ll be using gym facilities or a parking garage, make sure that an
attendant will be there at night. Be sure to park in a well-lit area, and
look around you before you get out of the car. Before you get in the car,
check the back seat to make sure that no one is in it. And always lock
your vehicle, even if you’re leaving it for only a moment.
Many hotels catering to business travelers are especially attuned to the
needs of women. Some offer concierge floors, which not only provide extra
services such as breakfast and evening cocktails, but also require a room key
to exit the elevator on that floor. This amenity is well worth the extra money
if it puts your mind at ease.
273
Chapter 20: Pack Your Manners! Traveling for Business

You shouldn’t travel with jewelry that could be stolen; if you won’t be wear-
ing it every day, don’t bring it. If you do have other valuables, however —
including your passport and other important papers — lock them up in the
hotel safe. That solution probably isn’t workable for protecting your laptop
computer, but you should lock the computer in your suitcase when you’re
out of your room. At minimum, don’t leave it sitting out on the desk, where it
presents an obvious temptation.
Moving around the city
If you were a mugger or a professional con artist, who would you look for: a
confident, professional woman with spring in her step, or someone who
looked as though she just fell off the turnip truck? Even if you feel uncertain,
you can’t let your uncertainty show. Take the time to learn what you need to
know so that you’ll look, if not like a native, at least like someone who can
take care of herself. If you’ll be walking somewhere, check the map before
you leave, and confirm your route with the concierge. That way, you’ll be able
to walk confidently and look as though you know where you’re going.
A cell phone has become a real traveler’s friend over the past few years. If
you get lost, help from someone you trust is just a phone call away. Keep
important numbers — your hotel, the colleagues you’re visiting, your credit
card company — close at hand. If you need to make a call, step into an un-
obtrusive (but not deserted) place to do so.
Be wary of strangers who approach you on the street. Although you don’t
want to rebuff someone who’s honestly looking for directions, you also don’t
want to seem overly friendly. If you feel uncomfortable for any reason, don’t
stop to speak with that stranger who’s trying to get your attention.

Chapter 21
Now You’ve Arrived: Adapting 
to a New World
In This Chapter
 Behaving with tact and respect abroad
 Hitting the road in a foreign land
T
he ugly American is not just a creation of fiction. Perhaps no culture on
Earth sends more rude or inconsiderate visitors overseas than the United
States. The reasons aren’t difficult to uncover: America is the most powerful
nation on Earth, and Americans all too often assume that because ours is a
powerful nation, our customs and codes of behavior are the best. Then we
take those customs and codes overseas and are shocked when not everyone
acts as we do and when some people have the effrontery to dislike us for
acting as we do — which oftentimes can be loud and demanding. Americans
also have been described as being too informal with their business dealings
in other countries.
In this chapter, I show you how to develop enough awareness to avoid expos-
ing yourself as someone with a lack of understanding of cultural differences. I
also give tips for using transportation in a foreign destination.
Minding Your Multicultural Manners
Volumes have been written about how to behave in other countries, from
attire to hand gestures to eating habits. In Chapter 22, I closely examine cus-
toms and etiquette by country and region. A few simple etiquette guidelines,
however, can carry you through a variety of cultural situations without
offending your hosts or damaging a business relationship:

 First off, erase from your mind any sense of xenophobia or cultural supe-
riority. If you were born in the United States, you may — as many
Americans do — believe that American culture is the best in the world.
Drop that attitude! To do business in other countries or with representa-
tives from other countries, you must realize that their cultures are differ-
ent, not inferior. In fact, words like good and bad really have no place at
all in describing cultural differences. Although your reaction to someone
else’s culture may be positive or negative, the culture itself simply is
what it is.
 Along the same lines, never assume that you’re doing someone a favor
by accepting his culture. Accepting and attempting to appreciate another
country’s way of life and business are necessary for you to succeed —
just like learning to deal with other people in your office. The attitude
that people are lucky to have you around so that they can learn how to
act like Americans won’t make you many friends around the world.
 You should avoid having heated discussions about politics anywhere —
in the United States, in the country you’re visiting, or pretty much any-
where in the world. You never know when you may say something that
will offend, even a remark that seems harmless to you. If your associates
begin criticizing other countries or governments, you may find yourself
in a no-win situation. If you defend the country, you may end up offend-
ing someone. If you join in the criticism, your colleagues may lose
respect for you and wonder why you would ever say something so nega-
tive about your own country. Either way, this sort of conversation is
best avoided. If someone tries to engage you in a political debate,
politely deflect her. Saying something like this may work: “I’ve learned
never to discuss religion or politics. Now, what can you tell me about the
history of your city? It’s so lovely.”
In the following sections, I offer additional guidelines for minding your multi-
cultural manners.
Keeping an open mind
In many cases, visitors to a foreign destination are eager to follow their hosts’
customs, and their hosts are eager to make the visitors comfortable by fol-
lowing the visitors’ customs. American businesspeople may be practicing
their bows in anticipation of Japanese hosts, for example, while those hosts
are practicing shaking hands and making eye contact like their American
guests. Absolutely nothing is wrong with meeting your foreign counterparts
and finding out that everyone is trying to adopt other customs. In fact, know-
ing that each participant is interested in making the other comfortable is a
great way to start a business relationship. In general, however, business-
people follow the customs of the country they are in.
276
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

Find out as much as you can about the cultures of people you work with. If
you’re traveling to another country for business, do some research. The U.S.
State Department Web site (www.state.gov) is an excellent place to start,
and plenty of other resources about customs and business around the world
are available online and in bookstores. Many companies offer online courses
for their employees traveling internationally. If someone at your company has
visited the country you’re traveling to, or if your company happens to have
employees there, tap those resources for information.
If possible, begin reading online newspapers from your target country before
you leave for your trip, and read daily newspapers after you arrive. Many
major newspaper sites and news portals offer search services that allow you
to specify search terms and get daily feeds of news about other countries.
Occasionally, a stranger or other visitor may ask you for directions when
you’re a visitor somewhere yourself. Congratulations! You must look like you
know what you’re doing. If you don’t know the directions, simply say that you
don’t know — without explaining that you’re a visitor too. You never defi-
nitely know the other person’s intentions, and you don’t know who might
overhear you.
Even on your own turf, you have many opportunities to learn from foreign
employees and visitors. Keep an open mind, and when you notice behavior
that seems unusual to you, ask about it (respectfully and with humility). For
example, say, “I noticed that women are reluctant to shake a man’s hand; is
this something that’s customary and not done in Vietnam? I certainly don’t
want to cause offense by offering my hand to a woman.” The more comfort-
able you make people feel, the more willing they are to explain. You may end
up expanding your knowledge and becoming a better employee to boot.
Bridging the language gap
Even if the people you’re visiting speak perfect English, it never hurts to learn
at least a few words and phrases of their native language as a show of respect.
Though they may snicker at your pronunciation behind your back (or even to
your face), they will appreciate the effort.
You also should realize that English speakers around the world use very dif-
ferent words and expressions, not to mention different accents. With a little
research, you won’t be alarmed when someone offers you a rubber for your
pencil or spotted dick for dessert, and you won’t make your English hosts
blush by describing your shag haircut.
Make yourself familiar with the various types of personal address used in a
country. Many languages use forms of you that are singular or plural, mascu-
line or feminine, and formal or informal. Even when you’re speaking English,
277
Chapter 21: Now You’ve Arrived: Adapting to a New World

however, forms of address are often much more formal in other countries.
Your pal Sol, the guy who writes the software in your office, may be Engineer
Solomon in some other countries.
Never begin using first names until you’re invited by the specific person to do
so. Although telemarketers in the United States feel free to call and ask for Al,
and physicians invite the elderly to “take off all your clothes, Peg, and put on
this paper gown,” most other countries are much more formal. Don’t even
ask someone’s first name. Mr. and Ms are the norm until someone tells you
otherwise.
Respecting religion
Religion is perhaps the most delicate of all subjects. Before you visit a coun-
try, find out what its major religions are, and learn at least something about
those religions. When people around you begin pulling out their prayer mats,
you shouldn’t look stunned. It goes without saying that you should never,
ever say anything disparaging about another religion, even if you consider
something to be weird, and even if your religion advocates converting others.
Remember, you’re there as a businessperson, not as a missionary. Don’t make
jokes about religion, either. Just as many Catholics don’t want to hear jokes
about what happens when the president, the prime minister, and the pope
are stranded on a desert island, your colleagues may not be amused by a joke
that begins, “So Buddha walks into a bar. . . .”
You probably shouldn’t ask any questions about religion, either, unless you
know someone very well and are certain that she won’t be offended. Though
your curiosity may be genuine, questions such as “I don’t understand why
you pray so many times each day. Can you explain it?” may be interpreted 
as rudeness or criticism. If you’re really interested, pick up a book on the
subject.
Avoiding a dining faux pas
Dining is something to be careful about. You should brush up on the cuisine
and dining etiquette of the country you’re visiting so that you’ll be ready, if
necessary, to sit on the floor, eat with your hands, not eat with your hands, or
swallow some new foods.
With all these opportunities for confusion, you’re bound to make a mistake at
least once in a while. That’s where your humble and respectful attitude
comes into play. Let the people you’re around know that you don’t know
everything and that you would appreciate being corrected when you do
something wrong. When you can tell from someone’s expression or body 
278
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

language that you’ve made a mistake, address it immediately. Say, “I’m afraid I
may have done something to offend you, and I’m so sorry. Please let me know
if I’ve made a mistake so I can avoid it next time.” If someone said this to you,
wouldn’t you forgive an offensive remark or two?
If you happen to be visiting with other Americans, agree to help one another
out. Or ask your host to share a few tips ahead of time. When you make a
blunder at the big dinner meeting, let your colleagues know so that they can
avoid doing the same thing the next day. Although sharing your blunder may
be embarrassing, you’ll help raise the cultural literacy of the entire group,
and your group (including you) will earn more respect from your hosts.
Dressing appropriately
In addition to helping you be an effective businessperson, dressing with
respect for the local culture can help you stay safe, avoid embarrassing your-
self or your company, and avoid offending others. In all cases, you should
dress on the conservative side until you’re very sure that you can branch out
without embarrassing yourself. When in doubt, women are always correct
with skirts that fall at or just below the knee and shirts with long sleeves. In
some cases, you should wear a skirt or dress rather than pants. Depending
on the occasion and the weather, men should wear a light, comfortable jacket
or sweater, a shirt, and long slacks. And even if you’re sightseeing on the
weekends as part of your trip, leave your shorts and sandals at home.
Women will be far better off with a roomy skirt in a breathable fabric, and
men with lightweight khaki pants and a cotton shirt.
In Muslim countries, the rules regarding clothing for women are more spe-
cific. Blouses with high necks and long sleeves are musts, and hemlines
should be midcalf or lower. The rules are less strict in Israel, but if you ever
visit a synagogue or a mosque, your knees and your elbows must be covered.
Women also may consider bringing along a shawl-size scarf. It can keep you
warm when used as a wrap and also cover your head if you’re visiting a
cathedral or doing business in Muslim countries.
For both professional reasons and comfort, women’s shoes should have low
heels and closed toes; men can wear a slip-on loafer or another comfortable
leather shoe. Remember not to wear a brand-new pair of shoes for travel, and
never wear tennis shoes unless you’re on your way to the gym.
Both men and women should keep jewelry to an absolute minimum. Wearing
your wedding ring is fine, but if your engagement ring is big and sparkly, you
might think about leaving it in the safe-deposit box at home. The same goes
for men and women’s watches; wearing a flashy or expensive designer watch
might attract criminals. Small gold, silver, or pearl earrings are good choices
for women, and the same goes for necklaces; you can easily accessorize with
279
Chapter 21: Now You’ve Arrived: Adapting to a New World

a scarf, which is much less of a temptation for thieves. Whatever jewelry you
bring, plan to wear all of it every day, or lock up valuables in the hotel safe.
Don’t leave anything in your hotel room.
In short, do your best to blend in so that you don’t make a bad impression.
This trip isn’t the time to wear your flashy baseball tie or to paint your nails a
garish color. The dress of other business professionals in the country you’re
visiting should be your guide. Check with other colleagues or the destination
tourism bureau to find out what’s considered the business norm.
Taking to the Foreign Road
Traveling around a new place by train, bus, or taxi isn’t always easy, espe-
cially in an unfamiliar country. It’s important to have a good understanding of
the transportation system before venturing out.
The various modes of travel and the appropriate etiquette rules for each are
fairly universal. A few exceptions to the rules occur, but most of the guide-
lines you should follow at home apply abroad as well.
Trains and buses
Regardless of the declining number of train and bus travelers in the United
States in the past few years, in other parts of the world, trains and buses are
still among the most efficient and comfortable means of transportation.
Service between and around major cities is dependable and inexpensive,
with most trains and buses arriving on schedule. The process of purchasing
tickets and checking in usually is convenient and simple.
You still have the potential to offend your fellow passengers or create cul-
tural clashes. The following guidelines will guarantee you a smooth ride no
matter where in the world you travel:
 Bring aboard only what you absolutely need.
 Arrive early. You don’t want to be running to board the train or bus as
it’s leaving the station.
 For long-distance travel, consider going in the middle of the week, when
transportation normally is less crowded. Daily commuter trains are less
crowded on weekends.
 If you’re the chatty type, take notice of the body language of the person
you want to engage. If it says, “I don’t care to converse,” pull out a good
book or your music player (and listen to music with headphones).
280
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

 Be pleasant and considerate when you’re speaking to a passenger seated
near you. If no language barrier exists, many times these conversations
can provide you interesting details of the city you’re visiting or your des-
tination location.
 If you use your laptop, check with your neighbors to make sure that the
noise you make typing will not be an annoyance, especially if you’re a
woman with long fingernails.
 Keep the volume down. If you’re speaking on your cell phone or talking
to another passenger, avoid loud conversations or loud laughing.
Though you may be enjoying yourself, the noise can be extremely irritat-
ing to those who may prefer to nap.
 If you plan to have a meal from the dining car on a train, wait until your
seating time is called.
 When moving through the aisle, make sure to give way to passengers who
are carrying luggage, passengers who have children, and elderly people.
 If you notice someone struggling with her baggage, offer assistance.
 Don’t keep your carry-on baggage, work items, purse, briefcase, laptop,
or other items on the empty seat next to you. If the train or bus is full,
you’ll just have to remove it for another passenger.
 If you’re a woman traveling alone, if possible, sit next to another woman
or a family rather than sitting next to an empty seat.
 Follow the smoking policy of the train or bus.
 Be aware of pickpockets. Keep important items such as your passport in
a zippered compartment or purse that’s held close to your body. You
also can keep items in the inside upper pockets of your jacket.
 Always keep a close watch on your belongings, and don’t ask anyone to
look after your things.
Do your homework, and grab the city train and bus maps from the hotel
before venturing out. Ask a hotel staff member to write down the location of
where you’re going and the return address in the appropriate language. Not
only can train and bus schedules be confusing, but also, you may not find
anyone who speaks English.
Taxis
If you’re comfortable taking cabs in a foreign city, go for it! Often, a taxi is the
most reliable and effective method of getting around in an unfamiliar city. In
Europe in particular, taxis are among the most convenient means of trans-
portation. Usually, it’s more convenient to take the taxi from the taxi station
than from the main streets. Almost all taxi drivers in France, Italy, and England
281
Chapter 21: Now You’ve Arrived: Adapting to a New World

are very familiar with the streets and can find your destination as long as you
can communicate clearly or write down the address correctly. (Using a taxi in
other parts of the world can be more of a challenge because of the popula-
tion and traffic.)
Ask the hotel concierge how you can identify a legitimate taxi from the so-
called “gypsy” cabs. In many countries, you could end up getting in the car
with a perfect stranger who isn’t licensed with any authority. The taxi may
end up being perfectly safe, but you shouldn’t take the risk. You might also
check with the hotel about the approximate travel time to your destination
and write down your hotel name and address if you plan to return.
Make an effort to familiarize yourself with where you are going and how long
it should take to arrive. Don’t rely on the taxi driver for this information. It
also can’t hurt to let a front desk staff member at your hotel know where
you’re going.
Normally, the front seat isn’t for passengers, and one taxi is allowed to take
three passengers. Act knowledgeable and relaxed after you enter the taxi. If
the driver asks what route you prefer, never say, “You pick; I don’t know
where I’m going.” Instead, say something like this: “Because you’re the expert
on driving in this area, please take whichever route you think is best.” If a lan-
guage barrier exists, avoid giving the driver too many specifics until you’re
closer to your destination, so as not to cause confusion.
When you’re on your way, jot down the cab driver’s name and medallion or
badge number in the unfortunate event that you leave an item in the taxi or
have a dispute.
As far as being a polite passenger goes, the rules are the same as they are for
any other public transportation. Be respectful of the driver, keep your voice
low, and don’t eat or drink in the cab unless you ask permission first. You
may alter your tip depending on the circumstances and the expected amount
for the particular city. If the driver helps you with your luggage or goes out of
the way to assist you in any other way, increase the amount.
If the driver seems to be going around in circles, ask him what he’s doing, and
ask him to stop and let you out if you think he’s truly taking you for a ride!
(You want to get out only in a busy area, of course, so you can easily find
another taxi.) Stay in the cab while paying your driver; you don’t want to be
half in and half out while you have money in your hand. Finally, be sure to
grab all your belongings before you step out of the cab; otherwise, your
driver may drive off with your purse or briefcase.
For obvious reasons, it’s best not to share a cab with strangers, either at
home or abroad.

 Understanding etiquette around the world
 Knowing what actions to avoid in business
E
ven if you’re well on your way to bona fide expertise in American busi-
ness etiquette, practices that pass as polite in San Francisco may be
deemed downright rude in Seoul or Seville. Just knowing about your area of
business expertise isn’t enough any longer. Whether you travel internation-
ally or do business with foreign clients at home, making a positive first
impression is more important than ever.
Keep in mind that you are not only a company representative when you
travel abroad, but a representative of your home country as well. It’s critical
that you always be respectful of other customs, cultures, and religions. To
achieve a global perspective, try to put yourself in other people’s shoes.
Blending in and conforming to social norms is often a form of flattery.
In this chapter, I introduce you to some of the most common etiquette issues
you’re likely to face when you travel internationally. I cover general customs
by region and discuss a few countries in detail.
The information in this chapter is a summary of tips on doing business in a
variety of countries. An excellent resource for more information is
www.executiveplanet.com.
Exploring Business Etiquette in Europe
Europe ranges from the cold northern countries of Norway and Sweden to
the warm Mediterranean countries of Italy and Greece. Some customs and
mores vary as much as the topography; others are shared across Europe.

Language
The European Union has 15 official languages, and though Europeans aren’t
going to give up their native languages anytime soon, English is fast becom-
ing the business “communication” language. The recent move to English is
coming from globalization and American cultural influence, and younger
Europeans who have studied abroad and traveled are more comfortable
using it. Even though most business professionals throughout Europe speak
some English, it’s always recommended to learn important key words of your
destination’s language.
Appropriate dress
For most businesses throughout Europe, business attire is formal, which
means dark suits, subdued ties, and lace-up shoes. In some countries —
Germany, Great Britain, and Denmark, for example — dress is ultraconserva-
tive and polished. In other countries — France and Italy, for example —
greater personal style within the uniform is tolerated and appreciated.
Women’s clothing follows suit.
The Netherlands is an exception. The Netherlands is a famously egalitarian
society, and this egalitarianism extends to business attire. Although you’ll
find plenty of conservative suits in some circles, you’ll also find business
casual up and down the hierarchy.
Greeting rituals
Handshakes are standard business-greeting gestures throughout Europe and
usually are exchanged both before and after every meeting, no matter how
many meetings you’ve already had. An exception is Great Britain, where (as
in the United States) an initial handshake may be the only one you receive.
European handshakes are more formal and less buddy-buddy than those in
the United States, with a quick grasp and release being the norm. In most
European countries, handshakes are firm; an exception is France, where
people prefer a lighter grasp. It’s customary to let women and those of higher
rank extend their hands first in Europe.
Europeans rarely use other people’s first names immediately. Never assume
that you’ll immediately be on a familiar basis or that because the person
you’ve just met is named Johann, you may call him that. Wait until he asks
you to call him by his first name or uses a familiar form of address with you.
Titles, especially academic titles, are always used in Europe. In the United
States, professors are rarely called “Doctor” or “Professor” outside the
284
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

classroom, but in European countries, professors — along with lawyers, med-
ical doctors, and other professionals — are introduced with their titles.
In Europe, the business card has a historical connection to the social card. As
a result, the proper exchange of business cards at a meeting is significant.
Most European businesspeople speak English, so your English business card
probably will suffice for most places you’ll go. You’ll do yourself a real favor,
however, by printing your business card in English on the front and in your
host’s native language on the back. Present the side printed in her language
to your host. In countries such as France and Germany, any advanced acade-
mic titles you hold that are printed on your business card carry a certain
cachet.
In some European countries, such as England, France, and Romania, business
card etiquette is a bit more relaxed and involves little ceremony; however,
business cards are exchanged frequently, so take a large supply.
The giving of business cards is typically done at the onset of a meeting, so
the recipient will have something to refer to throughout the meeting. When
you meet with several people, be sure to give your card to each person.
Slighting any one person would be considered a faux pas.
Handling meetings
In general, meetings in the northern countries of Europe begin promptly, and
the tone is businesslike, whereas meetings in the Mediterranean countries
begin late and are prefaced by seemingly irrelevant banter. This banter is
considered to be part of business, because it’s the best opportunity for your
host to get to know you — a prerequisite for business dealings in
Mediterranean countries (and many other places, for that matter).
The fact that meetings in the Mediterranean countries typically begin late
doesn’t mean that you can arrive late; it means that your host typically will
arrive late. Also, although your presentations should be precise, detailed, and
logical everywhere, their reception will vary. In northern countries, you’re
unlikely to be interrupted. Don’t expect the same elsewhere. Your beautiful
presentations are likely to be interrupted regularly in Italy, Greece, Spain,
Portugal, the Czech Republic, and the countries of the former Yugoslavia.
Dining and entertaining
Expect enormous variation when it comes to dining and entertaining in
Europe. But one virtually universal practice exists: Europeans don’t do busi-
ness breakfasts.
285
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

Dining is taken seriously in most of Europe as an expression of generosity. In
some countries, such as Italy and Greece, this generosity can reach stupefy-
ing levels; it can be virtually impossible to pick up a check in Italy and virtu-
ally impossible not to overeat or overdrink in Greece. Practically throughout
all Europe, it’s rude to refuse dinner invitations or any of the sumptuous
items offered to you at a dinner. The Continental style of dining is used
throughout most of Europe (see Chapter 12 for details).
In most of Europe, talking business over a meal isn’t a violation of etiquette.
In the Czech Republic, Italy, and Greece, however, you don’t talk business
over a meal unless your host initiates that discussion.
Giving and receiving gifts
Business and social gift-giving vary from country to country. In most coun-
tries, a small host gift is appropriate if you’re invited to someone’s home for
dinner, but not in Great Britain, where no host gift is expected.
Across most of Europe, business gifts should not be too personal and should
always be wrapped meticulously. Giving a gift unique to where you’re from is
appreciated; such gifts include a coffee table book about your state or city
and local delicacies from home.
In some European countries, such as Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Greece,
and Portugal, you don’t want to give a gift with your company logo, and it’s
best not to give a gift until after an agreement has been signed.
Social taboos
In many European countries, asking people what they do for a living or asking
them a personal question as an opening conversational gambit is a serious
mistake. Europeans are, for the most part, more formal and reserved about
such matters than Americans are.
Watch out for these gesture-related mistakes:
 Showing your palm to someone is offensive in Greece.
 In Belgium, keeping your hands in your pockets when speaking to some-
one is considered rude.
 In England, never stare at anyone in public; privacy is highly regarded.
Also, displaying a “V for victory” sign with your palm facing in is
extremely offensive.
286
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

 Back-slapping is out of place in northern Europe.
 Having your hands below the table while dining is considered rude in
most countries, especially France, Germany, and Austria.
Acting Appropriately in Africa
Parts of Africa have seen tremendous progress in recent years, especially in
business growth. But as you find out in the following sections, Africa is
immensely diverse, which can make business etiquette a little tricky.
General customs
Africa is so huge, so diverse, so complicated, and so rich that almost nothing
can be said about shared etiquette across the continent. I can point out a few
general customs, however:
 The northern countries bordering the Mediterranean are Islamic. The
lavish generosity, indirect business discussions, expansive sense of
time, and second-class-citizen status for women common to Arabic
countries are common in these countries, too.
 In the countries with colonial pasts, inroads of European etiquette have
occurred. Not surprisingly, these inroads follow the particular country’s
colonial affiliation. You’ll see some English manners in Kenya and
Nigeria, Dutch manners in various parts of South Africa, and Portuguese
manners in Cape Verde.
 Soft handshakes are common across Africa. In countries with large post-
colonial populations, such as Kenya and South Africa, expect European-
style handshakes. In the Muslim countries of northern Africa, such as
Morocco, you may find men holding handshakes so long that they
become handholds. Don’t be offended; this practice is common.
 Conservative is the keyword for business attire. In particularly hot coun-
tries, some easing up on the dark business suit is permitted. Your host
won’t be bound to Western dress, of course; he may show up in dressy
traditional attire.
 Africans are justly famous for the pleasure they take in eating and enter-
taining and for their generosity. If you’re invited to someone’s home
almost anywhere in Africa, be prepared: Your host will go all out to
impress and please you.
In Muslim countries, don’t eat with your left hand, which is symbolically
tainted. Watch your hosts in other countries for similar taboos. When in
doubt, do as your host does.
287

A multicultural mix: South Africa
South Africa is one of the most multicultural countries in the world. In addi-
tion to the indigenous black peoples of South Africa, colonialism and immi-
gration have brought in white Europeans, Indians, Indo-Malays, Chinese, and
many more. South Africa has been a political and economic success story
since becoming a democracy. With a stable political system, South Africa is
the financial, technological, and economic hub in Africa. In addition, South
Africa’s infrastructure, communications, and industries make it the leader in
international trade in southern Africa.
Language
An estimated 2,000 languages are spoken in Africa. The languages of Africa
are diverse and bear little relation to one another. South Africa alone has 11
official languages. The first is Afrikaans, which has its roots in 17th-century
Dutch and has been influenced by languages such as English, German,
Portuguese, Malay, French, and some African languages. However, even with
11 official languages, most businesspeople opt for English. English is the lan-
guage of administration and is spoken throughout the country. South
Africans often use metaphors and sports analogies to demonstrate a point.
Appropriate dress
In many companies in major South African cities, business attire has become
more informal. For first meetings, however, dress conservatively. Women
should wear business suits, dresses, or skirts with blouses and jackets; men
should wear dark-colored, conservative suits.
Greeting rituals
You may encounter many greeting styles in South Africa, depending on the
ethnic heritage of the people you meet. You can never go wrong by using last
names and titles when you first meet someone; academic titles often add a
great deal of luster. After you get to know someone well, switching to first
names is appropriate.
When doing business with foreigners, most South Africans shake hands while
maintaining eye contact and smiling. In South Africa, you can expect
European-style handshakes from most businesspeople you meet. In general,
handshakes between whites and whites, on the one hand, and whites and
blacks, on the other, may differ. Although white people shake hands with
another white person in much the same way as in northern Europe, whites
and blacks shake hands with an additional flourish. After shaking the full
hand, they grasp thumbs and then return to a full handshake.
Normally, women don’t shake hands; they merely nod. Wait for a woman to
extend her hand first, even in business settings.
288
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

Business cards are exchanged, but little or no ceremony is attached to the
exchange. Reading the card slowly is considerate; don’t rush to put it away.
Handling meetings
Major differences exist in communication styles, depending on each individ-
ual’s cultural heritage. For the most part, it’s important to maintain a harmo-
nious working relationship and avoid confrontations. Most South Africans,
regardless of ethnicity, prefer face-to-face meetings to more impersonal
media such as e-mail messages, letters, and telephone calls.
Appointments are necessary and should be made as far in advance as possi-
ble. Scheduling meetings with senior-level managers on short notice is diffi-
cult, although you may be able to do so with lower-level managers. A more
formal introduction will help you gain access to decision-makers.
Networking and building a relationship are crucial for long-term business
success. Developing mutual trust before negotiating is imperative. The initial
meeting often is used to establish personal rapport and to determine whether
you’re trustworthy. Deadlines often are viewed as fluid suggestions rather
than firm commitments. Always follow up with a letter summarizing the meet-
ing and the next steps.
Interrupting a South African while she’s speaking is considered rude.
Dining and entertaining
A majority of business in South Africa is done while dining out, either at a
restaurant or in someone’s home. Expect to discuss business before the meal
starts or at the conclusion of a meeting. Always arrive on time if you’re
invited out to eat, especially in someone’s home.
You can eat many meals with your hands; it’s important to use only the right
hand. If you’re dining from a communal dish, eat only from the side immedi-
ately in front of you.
Giving and receiving gifts
Business gift-giving isn’t as common in South Africa as in Asian countries. If
you’re invited to a colleague’s home, however, bring flowers, good-quality
chocolates, or a bottle of good South African wine. Personalized office acces-
sories with the recipient’s company name and logo are appreciated. Gifts nor-
mally are opened when they are received.
Social taboos
Africans, as a rule, are religious, reserved people. Women should always
dress conservatively, even if they’re attending an evening event. Wearing
revealing clothing is disrespectful.
289
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

Showing Respect in the Middle East
The Middle East is a region in which religion plays a significant cultural and
social role. The dominant religions are Judaism in Israel and Islam in coun-
tries such as Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Syria, Saudi Arabia,
United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, and Jordan. Some Christians live in
Turkey and Israel.
Because religion is so much a part of daily life in most Muslim countries, you
can expect certain differences — some mundane, some extraordinary. Among
them: Neither alcohol nor pork is consumed; the workweek in most Muslim
countries runs from Sunday to Wednesday or Thursday morning; and prayers
are said five times a day, during which time business stops. But the most
extraordinary difference is the rigid separation of men and women in the vast
majority of Muslim countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman being exceptions).
In Arabic countries in particular, women rarely go out in public, and when
they do, they’re heavily veiled.
The countries of the Middle East have experienced a couple of decades with
relatively little economic progress, and wealth is distributed unevenly among
the countries, with United Arab Emirates and Israel offering the highest living
standards for their entire populations, and Sudan and Yemen offering the
greatest economic problems for their entire populations.
Language
Several languages are spoken in the Middle East. Two hundred million people
speak Arabic in more than 22 countries, though the language varies from
country to country. English is widely used in business throughout the Middle
East and as the second language in most schools. Other languages include
Turkish, Farsi, Urdu, and Hebrew.
Appropriate dress
In Israel, business casual is acceptable in a wide range of businesses. In
Turkey and Arabic countries, go conservative, with dark suits and subdued
ties. Businesswomen still have a hard time in the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia
in particular, although less so now than ten years ago. Women must keep
their knees and elbows covered at all times; a high neckline is required. Men
shouldn’t wear any visible jewelry, especially around the neck.
290
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

Greeting rituals
Business and personal greetings are given enthusiastically, with a smile and
direct eye contact. Men shake hands and kiss each other on the cheek.
Among Jews, handshakes are standard greetings. Among Arabs, hugs and
kisses are standard. If you’re not Arab, you may get a handshake, but it’s less
like a handshake than it is a handhold, usually with both hands. Don’t get
nervous, and don’t move away; Arab men often hold hands as a gesture of
friendship. In business, men do shake hands with women; however, it’s rec-
ommended to wait for a man to offer his hand. Muslims greet each other with
“Assalaam Alaikum,” meaning “May peace be upon you and may God’s bless-
ings be with you.” Learning and using a few Arabic greetings is polite.
Titles in the Middle East are important. Always use full names and all appro-
priate titles upon your first meeting; however, Arab people are fairly informal
with names and normally address people by their first names, even in busi-
ness. Use the honorific “Mister” and any academic or political title and the
first name. Arab titles are “Sheikh” (an elderly man, leader, or scholar),
“Sayyid” (a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad), and “Hajji” (one who
has performed the pilgrimage).
Expect to exchange business cards with everyone. In Arab countries, it’s
polite and expected that your business card will be English on one side and
Arabic on the other. Present your card Arabic side up. In Israel, real engraved
business cards are preferred to printed ones. Raised-letter cards are less
impressive. Always present and receive business cards with two hands,
facing the person to whom you’re giving a card, and make a point of studying
the card before putting it into a business card holder.
Handling meetings
Morning meetings generally are preferred in the Middle East, and appoint-
ments are necessary; normally, business meetings aren’t scheduled until you
have arrived in the country. Be aware of religious holidays before scheduling
meetings, and in Muslim countries, don’t request meetings on Friday, which
is a day of rest.
Meetings can be long, chaotic, and even pointless to an American sensibility.
Interruptions (such as phone calls and people entering the room) are com-
monplace, and you’ll have to refocus people back to the topic repeatedly. In
Turkey and Israel, punctuality is prized, and meetings typically start on time.
But “meeting time” is a rather loose term in Saudi Arabia, where you may
wait an hour or more before your host appears.
291
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

When he (or, in Israel, perhaps she) arrives, you will begin with banter and
conversation centered not on business but on many other topics. When you
get down to business, you may be overwhelmed by the amount of argument
and haggling. In Arab countries, you not only hear lots of discussion, but also
many conversations occurring at the same time. Be patient. People in the
Middle East love to talk, discuss, wrangle, and argue. If no decision is made
on the spot, don’t be disturbed. The decision will come later — sometimes
weeks or months later.
The decision-maker in a meeting is most likely the person who’s speaking the
least (or who, at times, is only an observer).
Following are some general rules for meetings:
 Never say “no” directly; doing so causes shame. Find other ways to
express disagreement.
 Age is important in Turkey. Defer to the oldest person.
 Decisions are reached slowly, so don’t rush things; if you do, you’ll give
offense and risk your business relationship.
Dining and entertaining
Across the Middle East, hospitality is a means of demonstrating generosity,
power, and wealth. As a result, Jewish and Arab hospitality sometimes
appears extravagant to Americans. Accept the inevitable, and enjoy the
prodigious feast to which you’ll be invited.
Here are some tips for dining in Muslim countries:
 Meals are often served family-style. If a meal is served on the floor, you
should sit cross-legged or kneel on one knee.
 It’s polite to try a bit of everything that’s served.
 Eat only with your right hand. Eating with your left hand is symbolically
dirty.
 When you’re finished drinking a cup of coffee or tea, turn the cup handle
away from you to show that you don’t want another serving.
 It’s common for the person extending the invitation to pay. The invitee
may decline the offer at first to be polite.
292
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

Giving and receiving gifts
Gift-giving is common in Middle Eastern culture, though gift-giving isn’t the
norm in Saudi Arabia unless you’re invited to someone’s home; then it’s
appropriate to take something small. Always reciprocate a gift with equal
quality and value. Acceptable gifts are high-quality office accessories or gifts
of silver, porcelain, and crystal.
In Jewish homes, a gift of flowers to the host is preferred, but gifts to the host
are frowned on in Muslim homes.
Under no circumstances should you give a Muslim a gift of alcohol, a picture
of anyone or any animal, or anything made from pigs. Never give a gift to the
wife of an Arab colleague.
Social taboos
Here are some major social taboos in the Middle East:
 In most of the Middle East, it’s bad manners for an outsider to discuss
politics or religion. Don’t ask personal questions about spouses and
family, and never ask an Arab colleague about his wife or daughter.
 Crossing your legs and showing the soles of your shoes or feet are con-
sidered rude, as is openly disagreeing with someone, in Arab countries.
 Publicly holding hands with or kissing any member of the opposite sex
is offensive.
 Under no circumstances should you slap anyone on the back or point at
him with your finger.
 Refrain from looking at your watch when you’re speaking with business-
people; doing so is a sign of disrespect.
 The thumbs-up sign is rude in Muslim countries.
Behaving Gracefully in India
India is officially called the Republic of India, Hindi, or Bharat. It is the seventh-
largest country geographically and the second-most populous country in the
world.
India is composed of a multitude of religious cultures. The dominant religion
is Hinduism, but significant numbers of Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains,
293
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

Jews, and Christians also live in India. Onto this religious diversity is grafted
a layer of British formality and good manners, resulting in a population that
is as polite as it is distinctive.
In such a complex, diverse country as India, you must consider certain
important factors when you’re doing business — among them regionalism,
religion, language, and caste. You may need to modify your behavior and
approach depending on the person you are doing business with. You
absolutely must research the cultures you expect to encounter so as to avoid
making a major gaffe. You can’t rely on logic or wing it.
Hierarchy plays a key role in the Indian business culture. Indians are sus-
tained by extended family connections, which are maintained by socializing
and mutual help. People in the United States aren’t used to being so mindful
of family hierarchy and ties, so they may underestimate the function and
importance of those ties to people in India. Family matters may limit or
expand an Indian person’s field of action at any time. A family issue, for exam-
ple, may take precedence over work.
For details and guidelines on doing business in India, I highly recommend
Doing Business in India For Dummies, by Ranjini Manian (Wiley).
Language
Hindi is an official language of India. Many states have their own official lan-
guages, so Hindi might be less prevalent, especially in Southern India. English
is the language of international commerce, but be aware of the differences.
Indian English is more akin to European than to American English, which can
create confusion.
In some parts of India, language can be a sensitive issue, so sticking to
English is the safest bet, although learning some words in the language of
your hosts and contacts is always appreciated and admired.
The Indian cultural values of harmony and of being agreeable at all costs
translate into the inability to say “no” directly. For people who are direct and
like to know where they stand, this linguistic pattern is most frustrating.
Westerners’ bluntness, impatience, and meaning of “no” can be harsh and
blankly negative. On the other hand, the Indian “no” really means “maybe.”
When you’re conversing with someone from India, be aware of body language,
especially nodding, which can be very confusing if you don’t understand the
meaning. People in the West nod to mean “yes.” The same movement for
Indians can mean “maybe” or “no.” The shaking of the head from side to side,
as in a figure eight, more often signifies a “yes.”
294
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

Appropriate dress
Men should wear dark-colored, conservative, lightweight business suits for
formal events and first meetings. Women should dress conservatively and
modestly, wearing lightweight suits, skirts and jackets, or dresses; hems
should be below the knee, and necklines should be conservative.
If the weather is very hot and humid, attire can be more casual. This means a
long-sleeved shirt and a tie for a man, with long pants but no jacket. For
women, a blouse with a light cotton skirt or slacks or a dress is acceptable.
In certain contexts, such as the high-tech and movie industries, dress is more
informal, with people wearing tidy pressed jeans, T-shirts, and sports shoes.
Casual dress is worn at informal social gatherings.
Because the cow is considered a sacred animal in India, leather belts or hand-
bags shouldn’t be used in general, though this prohibition isn’t as strict in
the business sector.
Greeting rituals
In general, Indians are formal on first meeting. Elders are respected and
deferred to in many situations, business ones included. Caste rankings still
play a role in a wide variety of social and business interactions, although
they’re not as pervasive as they previously were.
Handshakes between Indians and Westerners, women included, are the norm
for most cosmopolitan areas. In areas of the country where religious tradi-
tions are still strong, however, Indian men may only put their hands together
and make a slight bow to a woman. You may see one Indian bow slightly to
another; that bow is a show of respect for age or for higher rank.
You can use the Hindi greeting throughout India. To do this, simply hold your
palms together in front of your chest and say, “Namaste” (nah-mas-tay) or
“Namaskar” (nah-mas-kar), with a slight bow. All Indian communities also
have their own non-Hindi greetings of blessings and goodwill. Muslims say
“Assalaam Alaikum,” to which you reply by saying, “Wa alekum-Salaam,” and
Sikhs traditionally greet one another by saying “Sat-Sri-Akal.”
The native language in southern India (such as Chennai and Bangalore) is
Tamal. Learning a few words in this language will go a long way in winning
new friends fast.
295
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

Use last names upon meeting people for the first time, and mention any
higher academic or other titles. In the south, both Hindu and Muslim names
identify a person first by given name, then “son of” or “daughter of,” followed
by the father’s name. Northern Indian names (usually Hindu) have a surname
and a given name. A married Hindu woman may drop her father’s name
behind hers and add her husband’s first name instead. Sikhs collectively use
the name Singh, used as a surname or between the first name and the
surname.
India is so linguistically diverse, and English is so widespread, that you don’t
need to translate your business card into Hindi. If you’re dealing with a
focused group that doesn’t speak English well, however, by all means trans-
late your card into the language that the group uses. Indians publicly
acknowledge academic degrees as well as any honors, so do add to your
business card any degrees you have.
Business cards should be exchanged at first meeting and are presented with-
out great ceremony. Be sure to present your card with your right hand. It’s
considered rude to put away a card you receive without exhibiting the cour-
tesy of reading it (and thus acknowledging the giver). Take time to read any
card given to you, and acknowledge the person’s name and position by
repeating it. Because Indian names can be difficult to pronounce, it’s fine to
ask whether you’re saying the name correctly.
Handling meetings
Meetings should be scheduled at least two to three weeks in advance.
Punctuality normally is expected, though being 10 to 15 minutes late won’t
have negative consequences; people in India have a tendency to be a little
late. Family responsibilities take precedence over business, so last-minute
cancellations are possible in business. Keep an open mind, and be flexible.
Indians of all religious backgrounds are wonderful speakers and take great
pleasure in discussing their beliefs eloquently. Business is no different; you
can expect a great deal of discussion of the details of a business deal.
Negotiations can be slow until a business relationship has been built. Indians
don’t base their business decisions solely on data and statistics; they also
use faith and intuition as guides.
Dining and entertaining
Business lunches are common, and it’s perfectly appropriate to discuss busi-
ness during lunch. Dinners at Indian homes are bounteous and delicious, and
contrary to people in most other cultures, Indians consider it rude to show
up on time! But you should be no more than 30 minutes late, either.
296
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

Most food is vegetarian. Hindus don’t eat beef, and Muslims don’t eat pork,
so these aren’t Indian specialty dishes. Don’t ask for them if they’re not on
the menu. Even if beef and pork are on the menu, it’s best not to request
them if your business colleagues are vegetarians.
Meals throughout India are eaten with the right hand. When you eat, do so
without using your left hand; as in Muslim countries, the left hand is symboli-
cally unclean. If serving utensils are provided, you may use them with your
left hand to serve yourself, but still avoid eating with the left hand. Eating
correctly with your fingers involves a very specific etiquette, so I highly rec-
ommend that you do a little research on the Internet or purchase a book on
etiquette in India and read up on the proper techniques; in a pinch, ask an
Indian colleague for a few pointers. Then practice.
Many restaurants add a service fee to the bill, so you don’t need to tip. Be
sure to score through the gratuity line on your credit card so that you don’t
end up doubling on a tip.
Giving and receiving gifts
People in Western cultures try to counter materialism by saying, “It’s not the
value of the gift, but the thought that counts.” Indians feel the same way.
Many Indians believe that giving gifts helps one’s path into the next life. For
this reason, gifts don’t have to be costly or large. Here are a few tips:
 Red, green, and yellow are lucky colors and good for wrappings. Black or
white wrappings are for funerals.
 Don’t give plumeria or white flowers, as they are used at funerals.
 Alcohol isn’t an appropriate gift unless you know the person or business
colleague well.
 Present your gift with both hands.
 Normally, you don’t open gifts in front of the giver. The recipient of your
gift will give you the same respect and not open your gift until later.
Social taboos
Here are some of the most general social taboos in India:
 The head is considered the seat of the soul. Never touch someone else’s
head, not even to pat a child’s hair.
 Never point your feet at a person. Feet are considered unclean. If your
shoes or feet touch another person, apologize.
297
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

 The right hand usually is used for cash transactions because it’s consid-
ered auspicious; you also use it for giving business cards. Don’t use both
hands, as you would in China and Japan (which I cover later in this
chapter).
 Indians don’t show physical affection in public. Actor Richard Gere
behaved inappropriately in 2007 when he spontaneously kissed an
Indian actress during a public event; all India was in an uproar.
Adhering to Traditions in Asia
Asian countries often have radically distinct cultures with radically different
etiquette. For Asia, more than any other region, it’s best to consult country-
specific books. Some similarities do exist, however.
The Pacific Rim countries — China, the Koreas, Japan, and Vietnam — have
ancient cultures that are heavily influenced by the social and political views
of the Chinese sage Confucius. Even where Confucianism isn’t official state
philosophy, many of its tenets are so deeply ingrained in the character and
comportment of people that it serves as the basis of behavior.
Confucianism is an entire worldview — part philosophy, part religion, part
etiquette manual, part political template, part economic treatise. It empha-
sizes respect for superiors, piety toward elders, love of family, duty to one’s
immediate society (village, town, and region), loyalty to friends and family,
hard work, wisdom, courage, humility, and unfailing courtesy to all. The
person who can embody these characteristics is a person of jen — the
Confucian superior man.
You’re less likely to be viewed as a jingoistic American if you recognize that
some cultural traditions of the Pacific Rim countries are more than 2,000
years old and are sedimented so deeply into an Asian person’s behavior as to
be almost involuntary, like eye color.
In the following sections, I discuss the business etiquette rules in two Asian
countries that are major business partners with the United States: China and
Japan. Here are a few tips, though, that apply to countries throughout Asia:
 Additional deference to elders is expected. Never interrupt the senior
member of the delegation.
 Always wait for a woman to initiate a handshake.
 Don’t try to hurry any meeting. A meeting takes as long as it takes, and
you can’t do anything to change that.
 Business gifts are considered symbols of appreciation, and generosity is
viewed as a valued personal trait.

Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

An important destination: Mainland China
China is the world’s second fastest-growing economy and one of the United
States’ largest trading partners. Economists predict this growth to continue —
making the trade relationship increasingly central for both the United States
and China. However, language, cultural, and political differences present sig-
nificant challenges when doing business in China. For successful business
transactions, it’s imperative to make an effort to understand and respect the
culture while building a relationship of trust.
For more on how to navigate China’s business culture, see Doing Business in
China For Dummies by Robert Collins and Carson Block (Wiley).
Language
The varieties of the Chinese language belong to the Sino-Tibetan family of lan-
guages. Each language has its own subdialects and dialects. More people
(more than one billion) speak Mandarin than any other language. It’s the
main language of China’s media, government, and educational institutions. In
Hong Kong and Macau, however, very few people speak Mandarin; instead,
they use English and other varieties of Chinese. More than 70 million people
speak Wú in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, in Shanghai, and in Hong Kong.
More than 60 million people speak Cantonese, mostly in Guangdong and
Guangxi provinces, on Hainan Island, and in Hong Kong and Macau.
Appropriate dress
Your default business wardrobe in China is conservative business dress, with
suits, ties, and tie-up shoes for men, and conservative suits and dresses for
women. Avoid flashiness of any kind.
Greeting rituals
Business greetings in China are easy; they’re the same as those in the United
States. You stand up, make a formal introduction, and remain standing during
the process of introductions. It may be difficult to tell who the senior person
is, so be very polite and forthcoming to everyone you meet.
Greet your Chinese contacts with a short nod or small bow. Many of them will
offer to shake hands, but they won’t give the robust handshake that
Americans associate with confidence and integrity. This fact has nothing to
do with being a wimp; it has to do with being respectful. Strong rules of
respect forbid much physical contact between strangers.
A Chinese surname comes first, followed by a given name. The two names
may be the same, however, as in Wei Wei; they may be hyphenated or joined,
such as Yi-Yen or Yiyen. Some people use an English first name that’s easier
for foreigners to understand.
299
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

Traditionally, a married woman keeps the use of her maiden name. You know
she’s married through the use of the word “Madame” in front of her full name.
However, on formal occasions, women have been known to use their hus-
bands’ names and then their maiden names, with or without their given
names (for example, Mrs. Wang Hu). A woman also may just use her hus-
band’s name without her maiden name following, as influenced by the British
in Hong Kong.
People get offended if someone consistently mispronounces their name. Even
worse, you may innocently be calling a person a rude word and making him
lose face in front of his own people.
It’s prudent to politely ask a person which name is his family name. It’s also
good to confirm how people would like to be addressed, as many people like
to be addressed with their business title. Government titles (such as chair-
man, general manager, or committee member) are important; use them when
you address officials.
I cannot emphasize Chinese business-card etiquette enough. Make it a ritual:
You’re presenting your business card, not handing it out. Tossing your card,
dealing cards like a bank teller, or displaying a casual attitude (such as plac-
ing a pile of your cards on a table and inviting people to take one) is disre-
spectful and will be noted.
You must give and receive a business card with both hands, with the writing
up and facing the recipient. This is a formal ritual in China and most of Asia,
so approach it with decorum.
Find out how your name would be pronounced phonetically in Chinese, and
have it printed on your card or on a name tag for your lapel, if appropriate.
Your card should have the information printed in Chinese on one side, even
in gold ink. You should have this side facing up when you present the card.
Never write on a business card, which is considered an insult because it
defaces the card. Also, under no circumstances should you put your counter-
part’s business card in your wallet and then put your wallet in your back
pocket.
Handling meetings
In China, the beginning of the meeting follows a definite pattern. The top
person from your host’s country comes in at an appointed position in the
flow of people. Normally, meetings have a brief prelude during which people
get to know one another.
Some of your junior Chinese business associates will arrive early. You don’t
have to start the meeting ahead of time; they are there in case you need them
for anything.
300
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

In virtually all Asian countries (China included), the conduct of the meeting is
fairly structured. Enthusiastic sales jobs are out of place. Speak slowly and
precisely, and give your host every opportunity to participate. Avoid saying
“no” directly. Plenty of qualifiers are available for you to use; emulate the way
your hosts disagree without disagreeing.
A written agreement isn’t as important to a Chinese businessperson as the
solidarity of his relationship with you. Chinese interpret rules in the context
of your quan xi — that is, the quality and integrity of your relationship.
Dining and entertaining
Though business lunches are quite common, the events that occur after work
are famous. You’ll find that Asians in general love to entertain in restaurants
and bars, and that the food is exquisitely flavored, prepared, and presented.
In China, expect a banquet — a long meal with innumerable courses served
one after the other. Arrive on time, and get ready to eat. Try something from
every serving dish, even if it’s only a little amount, but never clean your
plate. Symbolically, the meal’s munificence means that you can’t finish it.
Always offer food and drink to others before serving yourself, and don’t take
the last piece of food from the serving plate.
It’s best to keep an open mind about food. If you’re sensitive about what
foods you eat, stick to dishes you know. Chinese don’t always like Western
food, so you may find yourself dining at many Chinese restaurants.
In the past, tipping was frowned on in communist China, and to some degree,
it’s still not accepted as part of Chinese culture. It’s becoming more common,
though, especially in large cities like Hong Kong and Shanghai, and in many
Westernized hotels.
Giving and receiving gifts
Sometimes, you go to great efforts to prepare for your trip and forget to apply
some thought to the gifts you’ll give. You could arrive with a suitcase full of
the wrong types of gifts, such as nice travel clocks with your company logo.
Everyone can use a nice clock, right? Wrong!
Gift-giving in China and many Asian countries extends far beyond a gift to
your host. In most Asian countries, gifts of some kind are appropriate even
for a meeting. In Chinese culture, some people believe that certain numbers
have significant meanings. For example, anything with the number 8 is a wel-
comed gift; the word for “eight” in Chinese is similar to the word for “pros-
per,” “wealth,” or “fortune.” Other appropriate gifts are fine wine, liqueur
(such as cognac), or whiskey; high-quality office accessories; lighters, if you
know the recipients smoke; and technology gadgets.
301
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

Some gifts are considered offensive and should not be given in China, includ-
ing the following:
 White flowers and chrysanthemums
 Straw sandals
 Depictions of storks or cranes
 Scissors, knives, or other sharp objects that imply the severing of a
relationship
 Items that are white, blue, or black
 Clocks, which signify that one must prepare a funeral for an ancestor or
dead person
 Cheese, which few Chinese eat
In addition, giving a gift with your company logo ensures that the gift won’t
be seen as a bribe but more as a form of advertising.
For gift wrapping, plain red is the best color to use, but pink, gold, and silver
will do. Forgo yellow-and-black, plain black, or plain white paper. Have the
gift wrapped locally, if you can; the shop will know the optimum colors, or do
your research ahead of time and pack wrappings separately to use in your
hotel room.
Present your gift with both hands and a low bow, murmuring, “This is a little
something for you” or “A small token of appreciation.”
Be ready to accept a gift from your host as well. In most cases, these gifts will
be professional gifts. In China, politely refuse a gift at first and then accept it
graciously.
Social taboos
Here are some of the most general taboos in China:
 Both men and women should keep their feet on the floor, not hooked
under their chairs or crossed.
 Expansive hand movements are annoying and distracting to the Chinese
sensibility.
 Being too talkative or too loud makes you seem undisciplined and undig-
nified. To Chinese people, controlling one’s emotion is polite, so as not
to involve someone else in one’s own turmoil.
 Don’t be too “bubbly” and familiar, as in placing an arm around some-
one’s shoulders or even patting her lightly on the shoulder, asking some-
one to call you by your first name, or calling someone “Comrade” (even
if the Chinese do it among themselves).
302
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

 Don’t put your hand in your mouth to dislodge food.
 Don’t point when speaking.
 Stay calm if you’re angry (with a waiter who spills food or drinks, for
example, or an underling at work), in conflict, or experiencing a setback.
Remember, only children cannot keep themselves in check; adults are
supposed to be dignified.
The importance of dignity: Japan
In most countries, basic manners still apply, but in countries such as Japan,
the customs are so strict that a simple mistake can cost you not only the
deal, but also your dignity. The major religion is Shinto (“the way of the
gods”) and is woven into everything the Japanese do.
Language
The majority of the country speaks Japanese. You should use the language of
your client in doing business. If you don’t know Japanese, learn phrases like
“Hello, my name is,” “Nice to have met you,” “Goodbye,” “Thank you,”
“Please,” “Excuse me,” and “I’m sorry.”
If you’re fluent in Japanese and English, you should speak the language of the
higher-ranked member. If you’re using an interpreter or trying out Japanese,
speak slowly and clearly, without using colloquialisms.
Saying “yes” is done with a nod. Saying “no” is done by placing a hand in
front of the face and waving it back and forth. There is no word for “no” in
Japanese.
Appropriate dress
Appropriate dress is a level above how Americans probably dress for work.
Japanese business professionals are very careful in the way they dress, which
is on the conservative side. Men should wear well-pressed dark blue or black
suits and ties; businesswomen should also dress conservatively. Every item
must be clean and in neat and good condition. No wrinkled clothing allowed!
You will encounter many opportunities to remove your shoes, so make sure
that your socks or nylons are holeless, and have at least one pair of shoes
that are tieless. Scruffy shoes aren’t acceptable.
Greeting rituals
Most Japanese businesspeople shake hands and bow when greeting you.
When you bow, the degree is as important as the action:
303
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

 The 45-degree bow, with palms in front of your knees, is offered to only
the most senior members.
 The 30-degree bow, with legs straight and hands at your sides, is the
most common.
 The informal bow, which is the quick bowing of only the head and shoul-
ders, is used before you shake hands if your Japanese counterpart
extends his hand.
Allow your Japanese colleagues to lead the way. If they shake hands first and
then bow, you follow suit. Women normally don’t shake hands, especially in
social greetings, though today, this rule is changing among younger genera-
tions and in business.
Using titles and last names is important. In Japanese, the family name pre-
cedes the personal one. Yamaguchi Kazuo-san, for example, would be Mr.
Kazuo Yamaguchi in English.
Dropping the san from a person’s name is impolite. Simply refer to a person
as Mr. Yamaguchi-san, and you’ll be correct.
Business cards and their presentation are extremely important to the
Japanese. Not only is there a ceremony around presenting them, but also, the
Japanese view business cards as gifts.
Have your business cards translated into Japanese on one side, and change
your title if what you do isn’t clear. “Assistant manager” means very little
compared with “assistant to the president.”
Exchanging business cards involves a specific protocol:
 Take your card out of a nice holder. Men should carry a holder in the
breast pocket of a jacket, not in a pants pocket. Women should carry a
holder in a purse or a briefcase.
 Present the card Japanese side up, between the thumb and forefingers of
both hands, while bowing slightly. Your fingers shouldn’t cover your
name, company name, or logo.
 When receiving a card, take it between the thumbs and forefingers of
both hands at the top of the card.
 When you’re given a card, immediately thank the person who gave it.
View the card carefully. The longer you look at the card, the more
respect you are giving the person. It’s also acceptable to ask for the
pronunciation of the person’s name and to make a nice comment about
the card.
 Never put the card away immediately. Putting it in a separate section of
your card case is fine, but don’t put away the case right away.
304
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

 If you are seated while a card is given to you, it’s most polite to leave the
card on the table until the meeting is over.
 It’s impolite to write on a business card in the presence of the owner or
to slip it into a pocket, especially a back pocket.
Handling meetings
Japanese interactions involve a heightened sense of formality. When you’re
doing business in Japan, your suitability with respect to conducting business
will be assessed during a first meeting, so always maintain a sense of profes-
sionalism.
Business meetings usually take place for only one of three reasons: to build
rapport, exchange information, or confirm previously made decisions.
Decisions are rarely made in a meeting.
It’s important to recognize that Japanese business society is group oriented.
You’ll always deal with a team as opposed to an individual. Each attendee will
have a particular area of expertise, so either bring assistance or be sure that
you’re confident enough to handle all the questions you will receive.
The Japanese are very detail oriented. Expect lots of questions, repeated in
different ways. Be sure to have the answers available, as failure to answer
looks unprofessional. Bring as much written information on your company,
service, product, or proposal as possible.
If you’re meeting over a meal, wait until the meal is finished before initiating
any serious talk of business. A few documents can go on top of the table,
including a laptop computer, but only in a less formal restaurant. If it’s neces-
sary to have a number of documents and laptops, it’s best to request a pri-
vate dining area or private room.
Dining and entertaining
In Japan, business entertaining usually occurs after hours and rarely in the
home. You’ll be entertained often and many times with little notice. Be a
gracious guest and enthusiastic while eating, and show great appreciation
afterward.
Eating in Japan is simple and practical. Chopsticks are used as spoon, fork,
and knife; toothpicks are supplied and used ceremoniously by men. As in
most Asian cultures, chopsticks are used daily with each meal. Japanese
food, such as sushi and sashimi, normally is cut into bite-size pieces so it can
be eaten with chopsticks easily. There is a technique to using chopsticks, but
you can master it easily with just a little practice (see Chapter 12 for tips).
305
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

Giving and receiving gifts
Gift-giving in Japan is deeply rooted in Japanese culture. It’s important both
socially and in business. Always bring gifts for new and old contacts. These
gifts should be indicative of your rank with your company; the higher your
rank, the higher quality of the gift. Don’t give monetary gifts or gifts display-
ing company logos, though office accessories such as a good-quality pen are
suitable. Wrappings should be natural paper with no paper ribbons. Use red
and white for happy occasions, black and white for funerals, and gold and
silver or gold and red for weddings. When you visit a home, bring candy,
fruit, cake, cookies, or other specialty foods.
As with business cards and other rituals, presenting your gift properly is
expected. Gifts are offered with both hands. Normally, the gift is set aside to
be opened later. It isn’t customary to urge the recipient to open it.
Social taboos
Be sure to avoid these taboos in Japan:
 Unless you know a person well, telling jokes and discussing private
matters (such as spouse or children) is rude unless the other person
offers first.
 Don’t cross your arms when speaking or listening to someone.
 Avoid using American slang at all costs.
 When dining, never point, gesture, talk with your chopsticks waving in
the air, or take food from another person’s plate with your chopsticks.
Doing Business in Australia 
and New Zealand
Australia and New Zealand are separate countries, each with its own distinct
national identity that includes particular customs and rules of etiquette:
 Australia is a casual country, and its people are friendly and open. You
find overt formality in only the most rarified circles in Melbourne and a
few other cities.
 New Zealand, on the other hand, is more like Great Britain, with greater
formality and less instantaneous camaraderie.
306
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

Language
English is the official language of Australia; however, Australians’ colorful
vocabulary, accent, and slang can take a lot of getting used to. The two offi-
cial languages of New Zealand are English and Maori. English is the language
of day-to-day business within New Zealand — a remnant of ties to the British
Commonwealth.
New Zealanders take great pride in their proficiency in the English language
and hold anyone who also does so in high esteem. They are less forgiving of
mistakes in spelling, grammar, and syntax made by Americans, Canadians,
and Australians (other than those whose first language isn’t English).
Appropriate dress
Men wear a conservative dark business suit, white or colored dress shirt, and
tie. Always try to be tasteful and stylish, and lean toward the conservative.
Women are advised to dress simply but elegantly, wearing a dress or a skirt
and blouse for business.
Informal clothing is appropriate for working in the information-technology
sector. Casual pants are fine for both men and women in this area.
Greeting rituals
Greetings are casual, often consisting simply of a handshake and a smile.
Australian and New Zealander handshakes are firm and quick. Giving some-
one a limp handshake is referred to as giving someone a “dead fish,” so keep
it firm. Don’t grasp the other person’s hand with both of yours, and don’t
keep shaking. Women typically don’t shake hands with one another in
Australia but typically do in New Zealand. In both countries, women are
expected to extend their hands to men first.
Australians and New Zealanders dislike pretense. Although you should call
someone by his last name when you first meet him, this practice won’t last
long — especially in Australia, as you’ll probably soon be invited to call your
host by his first name. New Zealanders are more reserved when you first
meet them, but they, too, will warm to you quickly. Announcing your title
when you meet is offensive because it’s perceived as showing off.
Business cards are exchanged, but little or no ceremony is attached to the
exchange.
307
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

Handling meetings
Meetings start on time and get to the point at hand without many preliminar-
ies in both countries. In fact, in New Zealand, arriving a few minutes early is
polite. Business is conducted with respect, honesty, directness, and a trace of
a sense of humor, but avoid showing strong emotions. Even though meetings
generally are relaxed, they are considered serious matters. A brief amount of
small talk is common.
If you make a presentation, keep it simple. Avoid making exaggerated claims
and adding a bunch of bells and whistles.
Dining and entertaining
Lunch can be a business affair, but both the near-obligatory call at the pub
and dinners are social events. Arrive on time in Australia and New Zealand.
Table manners are Continental style, with meals often served family style.
Although both Australians and New Zealanders typically are casual in their
manners, follow proper protocol on more formal occasions.
Meeting for tea is common. Afternoon tea is around 4 or between 6 and 8 p.m.
and is an evening meal.
Giving and receiving gifts
Bringing a bottle of Australian wine, a box of chocolates, a book about one’s
home country, or some other small item to your host’s dinner party is
expected. Don’t bring anything lavish, however. Recipients customarily open
gifts when they’re presented.
Social taboos
Being overly demonstrative with another man is a taboo for men in Australia
and New Zealand. Also, trying your hand at saying “G’day, mate” is more
likely to result in offense than anything else. The “V for victory” sign is given
palm out; given palm in, it is offensive.
Certain national sensitivities are particular to New Zealanders. The term
mainland isn’t used for either the North or South islands of New Zealand; nei-
ther is it used to refer to Australia.
308
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

Building Business Relationships 
in Latin America
Latin America stretches from the Texas border to the tip of Tierra del Fuego
in South America. Latin America’s Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking popula-
tions are predominantly Catholic; its native inhabitants are primarily non-
Catholic. The culture is patriarchal, with rigid divisions between work and
home life: Men are in business, and women are at home with the family. As a
businesswoman traveling to many locations in Latin America, you should be
aware up front that this insistence on strict gender roles can be jarring and
may be directed at you sometimes.
Anyone going to Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Colombia, Chile, or Peru
should know enough about the current political climate to avoid discussions
that could skewer business dealings. These countries have faced serious
political upheaval in the past quarter-century, and even where the wars are
over, the scars are very deep.
In most Latin countries (particularly Mexico), people prefer doing business
with those they know, like, and trust. Therefore, your success depends on
your ability to establish rapport and maintain good relationships.
Interpersonal skills are necessary to fit in; these skills can actually be more
important than professional experience and know-how.
Brazilians, because of their Portuguese roots, have a relatively relaxed
approach to life and business. They view business as being like any other
sort of social interaction and place much more focus on relationships and
business decisions than on profit margins.
Language
Spanish is the primary language spoken in Latin America, where people are
proud of their language and aren’t particularly eager to use English. You do
yourself a favor by knowing Spanish; if you don’t, at least learn a few key
words and phrases.
Unlike most Latin American countries, Brazil uses Portuguese as its official
language. Like other languages, of course, Portuguese has variations. Though
nearly all the population in Brazil speaks Portuguese, English is now studied
in schools and has replaced French as the principal second language.
309
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

Many Brazilians also understand Spanish, because Portuguese has many
components that are similar. Also, the neighboring countries all consider
Spanish to be their first language, so speaking some Spanish is practically a
necessity, especially in border areas.
Both verbal and written correspondence is more formal in Latin America
than in the United States. Latin Americans believe that the use of elegant lan-
guage shows good manners and professionalism.
Appropriate dress
You won’t go wrong by dressing conservatively: suits and ties for men,
modest business suits and long dresses for women. Argentina probably is the
most formal of the Latin American countries, and Brazil is the least formal.
Venezuelans enjoy expensive accessories so long as they’re in good taste.
Greeting rituals
Latin Americans generally are very friendly, very physical, and very good
hosts. Normally, people get to know one another first and then do business.
In fact, you probably won’t get any business accomplished during your first
meeting, and you may not get much done on your first trip, but you’ll stay up
late for dinners and parties.
Handshakes are firm and relatively brief. Constant eye contact during a hand-
shake is crucial in Mexico and Argentina. In most countries, men shake hands
with men, and women shake hands with women. In Brazil, Peru, and Mexico,
men and women also shake hands, with the woman extending her hand first.
After a relationship has been established, don’t be surprised if you’re met
with a hug.
Male friends hug each other upon seeing each other. Female friends kiss each
other on each cheek and touch each other’s arms. Throughout Latin America,
expect your conversational partner to stand close to you, and expect casual
arm touching or shoulder patting. Don’t move back, and don’t waver in your
eye contact.
When you meet someone for the first time, use your last name and whatever
titles you have. If you don’t know the other person’s professional titles, use
Mr., Mrs., or Ms (Señor, Señora, or Señorita). Common professional titles are
doctor, teacher, engineer, and lawyer (doctor, professor, ingeniero, and
abogado).
310
Part V: Doing Business on a Global Scale 

In business situations, you can generally plan on addressing others by last
names only. First names are reserved for close acquaintances and family. It’s
best to avoid using a first name until you’re invited to do so.
Latin American surnames are composed of both the paternal name, which
comes first, and the maternal name. Only the father’s surname is used when
addressing someone. Be careful which name you choose to use, as the
Spanish and Portuguese cultures are opposite.
Business cards are exchanged without much ceremony; presenting your card
properly in American style will do (see Chapter 5). Your business card should
be printed in both English and Spanish (or in Portuguese if you’re in Brazil).
Present your card with the Spanish or Portuguese side up.
Handling meetings
In some countries in Latin America, timekeeping can be a relaxed affair; meeting
times are set but not respected. In Mexico, however, due to long-established
business links with the United States, Mexicans are used to Western business-
people being on time and try to do the same.
You’re expected to arrive in a timely manner, but your host isn’t, and the
more important he is, the later he’ll be. Meetings themselves follow the pat-
tern of most Spanish-speaking countries, with lots of preliminary discussions
designed to establish rapport. Business discussions occur only after rapport
is established, and after they start, they’re comparatively disorganized and
subject to interruption. Decisions typically aren’t made during first meetings.
Dining and entertaining
Business lunches are common throughout Latin America, and they’re usually
long, from 1 or 2 p.m. until 3 or 4 p.m. Dinner is a purely social event and can
occur very late; it’s not unusual to sit down to dinner at 10 or 11 p.m.
throughout Latin America. Don’t bring up business at dinner unless your
Latin American host or guest does so first.
Because many different countries make up Latin America, dining styles and
etiquette can differ by region. It’s best to do a little research on your destina-
tion before you arrive. Generally, the Continental style of dining is used in
business (see Chapter 12). It’s not necessary to eat in the Continental style,
though, if you’re more comfortable using the American style. You should
keep your hands above the table at all times while eating, and pass food and
drink with your right hand.
311
Chapter 22: Crossing Cultural Lines: Your Passport for Success

Giving and receiving gifts
Gifts in most Latin American countries aren’t expected on the first visit; how-
ever, gift-giving is more acceptable with subsequent visits and can help build
stronger business relationships and friendships. Appropriate gifts include
fine chocolates, a bottle of good wine or liquor (if you know the recipient
drinks), business card holders, high-quality pens, or other office accessories.
Flowers are a good choice when you visit someone’s home; check with a local
florist first for an appropriate bouquet to fit the occasion.
Venezuelans don’t entertain at home very much. Being invited to someone’s
home is an unusual honor and shouldn’t be taken lightly, so make sure that
the host gift is something special.
Social taboos
Be aware that the following gestures can cause problems:
 The sign for “okay” formed by your forefinger and thumb is offensive in
Brazil and Colombia.
 Don’t cross your fingers (as a sign of good luck) in Paraguay; it denotes
the act of sex.
 Putting your hands on your hips signals a challenge in Argentina.
 Putting your feet on a table is rude throughout Latin America.
 Raising your fist to head level is a gesture associated with communism
in Chile. Also, slapping your right fist into your open left palm is viewed
as an obscene gesture, and displaying your palm up with your fingers
spread apart means “stupid.”
 Putting your hands in your pockets is rude in Mexico.

A
re you about to graduate? How confident are you about your knowledge
of Western business etiquette? Knowing the social graces in business
can make or break your career, because no matter how brilliant a student or
employee you may be, a lack of business protocol and social grace will hold
you back in the corporate world. In a market that’s growing more competitive
every day, you certainly want to have every advantage. When you’ve fol-
lowed the basic guidelines in this chapter, you can consider yourself to be a
true professional.
A successful career doesn’t come only to those who’ve worked longest or
hardest or to those who have the most impressive résumés. These days,
many corporations are unwilling to send people to the front lines unless they
have a little polish, style, and finesse. A little finesse can give you a competi-
tive edge over other applicants who may not be as polished as you are.
Start with Some Etiquette Research
For hands-on etiquette experience, graduating students need only to do a
little research. You can find shelves of etiquette books, etiquette DVDs, and
etiquette training companies across the United States. Check with your
school to see what’s available, and search the Internet for additional
resources. For etiquette books and DVDs, go to www.amazon.com and
search for the term etiquette. You also can check out www.etiquette
survival.com for help.

Take an Etiquette Class
Consider attending an etiquette class before you graduate. In most large
cities, you can find etiquette training and consulting businesses. Many col-
lege campus career centers also offer etiquette courses or workshops near
graduation time.

Absolute accuracy in a cover letter and résumé is essential for making a posi-

Writing a résumé and cover letter isn’t an easy process. If necessary, hire a
professional résumé service. Check your school’s resources; most colleges
have writing labs for additional assistance with cover letters and resumes.
Also, try visiting a few job search Web sites such as www.monster.com and
www.careerbuilder.com. Often these sites publish articles with practical
advice that can help you with writing résumés and cover letters.
Present Yourself Professionally
Many people try to avoid passing judgment too quickly, but at first meetings,
they inevitably assess other people by how they look. Ask yourself these
questions:
 Does your work wardrobe help you present a confident, well-groomed
image?
 Are the clothes suitable for the type of work you do (or want to do)?
 Do you have clothes that can take you from work to a social
engagement?
Get a “college student to career professional” makeover. Try a new hairstyl-
ist, attend a wardrobe workshop, and have new makeup applied by a profes-
sional. Depending on the type of job you’re interviewing for, you should
conceal your tattoos and remove your body jewelry unless you know for
certain that those adornments are acceptable to the employer. Build your
316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

business wardrobe as soon as possible, too. Fine apparel and accessories can
be quite an investment, so shop wisely, and coordinate classic items for
versatility.
See Chapter 4 for details on how to present yourself professionally.
Master the Art of Introductions
You may perform introductions all the time, but you may not realize that
introductions create enduring impressions. Focus on these concepts:
 If a coworker or colleague isn’t available to introduce you, it’s proper to
introduce yourself in business and social functions. Be sure to know the
difference between a personal and business introduction.
 Find out the proper way to present and receive a business card.
 Don’t forget to smile, and use good eye contact and a firm handshake.
Flip to Chapter 5 for full details on the art of meeting and greeting.
Communicate with Style and Confidence
Leave the slang phrases, jargon, and four-letter words in the dorm room.
Trendy talk isn’t appropriate in a professional setting or in the break room or
cafeteria of your company. Master several ways to start conversations
(Chapter 6 is a big help), and know how to end them gracefully. Always
remember to listen more than you talk.
Experience the Magic of Networking
Attend career fairs while you’re looking for a job, and network at special
events even after you’ve scored a job. If you’re interested in working over-
seas, you can make contacts and establish overseas networking by attending
international exhibitions and conferences or by joining an international net-
working discussion group on the Internet. Networking events and groups can
be fulfilling and produce results like these:
 Networking within your community increases your chances of finding
publicized and unpublicized job openings. Mastering the art of network-
ing can lead to solid employment referrals.
317
Chapter 23: Nearly Ten College-to-Career Etiquette Tips

 Networking can provide ongoing support with business contacts.
 Networking can provide opportunities to develop your skills and knowl-
edge in a specific industry as well as opportunities to share ideas.
Send a thank-you note to sources of new connections, and keep them
informed of your progress. They may have a vested interest in your success
and will probably want to support you as much as they can.
Chapter 13 has the scoop on networking at special events.
Make Yourself Clear on the Phone
Many times, the first contact you have with an individual is over the tele-
phone, so the impression you make can be a lasting one. Therefore, you want
to sound confident and professional — especially if the call is about a possi-
ble job. For complete details of how to make a positive impression on the
phone, see Chapter 7.
Cultivate Contacts via E-Mail
Strive to communicate with colleagues from other countries who share your
interests. If your company has offices internationally, check the employee
directory and contact coworkers via e-mail. You also can search country-
specific international job sites on the Internet (an excellent site is www.
international-business-careers.com) or look for specific international
companies that post job openings.
The rules that apply for e-mail communication at home are even more impor-
tant when you’re communicating with someone in another country. Here are
some guidelines:
 Most cultures communicate in a more formal manner than people in the
United States do, so use the proper title of individuals in your greetings.
 Avoid using slang terms or words that can take on double meanings.
 Consider the time difference and the day of the week before you send an
e-mail. If you send an e-mail on Friday morning, it may be Saturday after-
noon for the recipient. Or you may send an e-mail on a holiday that you
weren’t aware of and the recipient is off work.

Job Interviews

nterviews can be among the most challenging meetings you will ever have.
Not only do you have to make certain that you’re dressed appropriately,
but you also must arrive on time, and you have to know what to say, when to
say it, and what questions to ask. Being prepared will boost your confidence,
and knowing how to behave should help calm your nerves and ease your anx-
iety. Heed the advice in this chapter, and you’ll be on your way to the job you
want! Flip to Chapter 2 for additional information on job interviews.
Do Your Homework on the Company
Get familiar with the overall company and the future it may hold for you. Test
the products; research the company online by visiting its Web site, blogs, and
press materials; and check out the company’s ranking in the stock market, if
applicable. Why is knowing all this stuff important? You’ll be better prepared
to answer questions and ask intelligent questions, which shows that you’re
well-informed and that you did your homework. It also shows that you have
interest and enthusiasm in the company.
Practice Your Answers
It’s a good idea to keep a log and draft your answers to the most commonly
asked interview questions. These Web sites feature such questions:

 hotjobs.yahoo.com
 www.interviewup.com
 www.job-interview.net
Practice speaking the answers out loud into a tape recorder or to a friend or
family member until your answers sound natural and not overly rehearsed.
Prepare questions of your own as well. Traditionally, at the conclusion of an
interview, you have an opportunity to ask questions. Here are a few examples:
 “What are the opportunities your industry (or company) is facing?”
 “What are the challenges your industry is facing?”
 “Can you tell me the company’s plans for future growth over the next
few years?”
 “What have you found most rewarding about working at the company?”
 “How would you describe the corporate culture here?”
Dress the Part
Decide way in advance what you’re going to wear. Conservative, tailored
apparel usually is appropriate. Don’t wear jewelry that makes noise (such as
bangles or large earrings). In some cases, dress codes have relaxed, so check
with others who know the company dress code to make sure that you aren’t
overdressed or underdressed (flip to Chapters 2 and 4 for ways to find out
about company culture and appropriate dress). Your appearance makes or
breaks what could be an enduring first impression.
Dress as though you already have the job. You may be interviewing for an
entry-level job, but someday, you may want to run the place!
Arrive Early
Get accurate directions to the interview site. Make a dry-run trip to estimate
the time you’ll need to get to the interview on time. Plan where you park,
what entrance to use, and where to go after you’re in the building.
Being late is never acceptable! Arrive at least 10 to 15 minutes early.
320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Be polite to the people around you. A receptionist, security guard, or other
employee can help you find the location quickly. Being overly friendly, how-
ever, can work against you if the other person is busy or not talkative.
Don’t assume that the person who greets you is the receptionist. He may be a
top executive or your interviewer.
Make a Lasting First Impression on the
Interviewer
In first meetings, people may try to avoid passing judgment too quickly, but
interviewers inevitably assess candidates on how they look and handle them-
selves. Here are a few tips to help you make that good first impression:
 Arrive with a smile. If you’re seated, stand up to greet the interviewer by
name, with a firm handshake and good eye contact.
 Confirm the pronunciation of the interviewer’s name and her title in
advance. Refer to the interviewer by her first name only if she gives you
permission to do so.
 Do not chew gum, eat, or drink on the premises unless refreshments are
provided, and sample them sparingly if they are available. Leave your
own water bottle in your car.
 Tobacco use of any kind is not appropriate. If you do smoke, be sure to
wash your hands and use a mouthwash or mints right before your inter-
view so you’re certain that there is no lingering cigarette odor.
Keep It Simple and Stay Focused
Here are some tips for keeping things simple and focused during an interview:
 Bring a nice notepad, crisp copies of your résumé, and a good pen.
 Don’t fumble with a large briefcase or handbag.
 Turn off your cell phone (or leave it in the car) and alarm watch.
 Sit up straight, and never touch anything on the interviewer’s desk.
 Try not to fidget with your clothes, play with your hair, pick your nails,
tap your fingers on the table, or let your eyes wander around the room.
Focus, focus!
 Did I mention turn off your cell phone?
321
Chapter 24: Ten Tips for Impressive Job Interviews

Play It Cool
Be attentive, and give specific, concise answers to the questions. Allow your-
self time to think about your answers. Don’t rush to speak too quickly or inter-
rupt the interviewer. And, of course, don’t swear or use off-color language.
If you’re asked a question that you did not anticipate, relax. Do your best not
to say “uh,” “like,” or “you know what I’m sayin’.” Being prepared with a clear
understanding of why you’re applying for the job will help you answer any
unanticipated questions. And when you’re asked a yes or no question, try to
elaborate and provide additional information to support your response.
Use Your Best Table Manners
If you are interviewing in a restaurant, brush up on your table manners; this
practice alone can give you additional confidence. How can you concentrate
if you’re worried about which fork to use? Two important guidelines:
 Don’t order a meal that’s difficult to eat, such as a big burger, spaghetti,
or finger food.
 Don’t drink an alcoholic beverage, even if it’s offered.
See Chapter 12 for full details on dining etiquette.
End the Interview on a High Note
Always conclude the interview with another smile, a firm handshake, and eye
contact, and thank the interviewer for her time. Walk out with confidence and
a nice sense of relief. Whether you get the job or not, going through the
process of an interview is a great learning experience.
Send a Thank-You Note
Immediately follow up with a handwritten note. Buy the paper and address
the envelope in advance, if that helps. Express your thanks while the
thoughts are fresh in your mind, and mail the note right away. You’ll score
points and make a good impression with your attention to follow-up.
Allow several days to pass before you call or contact the interviewer by
phone or e-mail. Be patient. Follow up no more than once every week.
