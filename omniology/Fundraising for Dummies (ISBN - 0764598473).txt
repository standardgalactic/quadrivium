About the Authors
John Mutz: John Mutz is a fundraising expert and speaker who has an exten-
sive array of fundraising credits. He was named 1997 Volunteer Fundraiser of
the Year by the Indiana Chapter of National Association of Fundraising
Executives. In 1999, John served as Chairman of the United Way of Central
Indiana, which raised more than $36.5 million. From 1996 to 1998, John served
as Chairman of the Indianapolis Zoo, where he chaired a $14.5 million fundrais-
ing campaign for White River State Park Gardens. From 1989 through 1994,
John was the president of the Lilly Endowment, one of the nation’s five largest
private foundations, which supports the causes of religion, education, and
community development. The Endowment included in its grant-making activity
special grants intended to improve the financial viability of nonprofit organiza-
tions. It was also during his time there that the Lilly Endowment made the
grant that brought the Fundraising School to the Center on Philanthropy at
Indiana University Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI). 
In 1988, John was the Republican Candidate for Governor of Indiana, during
which time he raised $4 million for the campaign. He is also co-founder of the
Indiana Donor’s Alliance, a statewide organization of Community Foundations.
In addition to his board positions, John serves as a regular speaker for the
Executive Leadership Institute (National Society of Fundraising Executives),
the National Council of Foundations, and The Center on Philanthropy. He has
also been a speaker for the Rocky Mountain Council of Foundations and
Hillsdale College and has given dozens of speeches to community foundations.
John served as Indiana’s Lieutenant Governor from 1980 to 1988 and recently
retired as president of the state’s largest electric utility.
Katherine Murray: Katherine Murray has written dozens of books on a variety
of topics, ranging from computers to parenting. From her early Introduction to
Personal Computers (1988, Que Corporation) to Discovering PCs (1997, IDG
Books) to The Working Parents’ Handbook (1996, Park Avenue Productions),
Katherine has specialized in writing how-to books for general audiences. A
number of years ago, Katherine’s “how-to” writing led her into the nonprofit
world, when she volunteered her research and writing skills to help selected
nonprofit organizations with missions close to her heart. Since that time,
Katherine has completed a certification in Fundraising Management from the
IU Center on Philanthropy and become a kind of “fundraising coach” for small
and struggling nonprofits.
Today, Katherine continues her work as a nonprofit consultant — often work-
ing as a volunteer — helping organizations return to their missions, compose
attention-getting case statements, develop fundraising plans, create publish-
ing and media strategies, and research and write grant proposals. In addition
to her nonprofit work, Katherine is the Publisher of KIDSRIGHTS, a company
in Indianapolis, Indiana, that publishes and distributes materials for children
and families in crisis. KIDSRIGHTS materials are often used by nonprofit pro-
fessionals who serve families facing the difficult issues of domestic violence,
child abuse, rape recovery, teen parenting, and drug and alcohol addictions.
It is Katherine’s hope that Fundraising For Dummies, 2nd Edition, will give
those organizations what they need to make their fundraising more effective
and serve a greater number of families than they ever have before.


Dedication
To the thousands of volunteers who give of their time, effort, and wealth to
support nonprofit causes throughout the world. These people truly are the
individuals who possess the “habit of the heart” that Alexis de Tocqueville
wrote about in his great book Democracy in America.

Introduction
N
obody begins working with a nonprofit saying, “Gee, I’ve always wanted
to ask people for money!” The involvement usually begins with a need —
a need we become aware of, whether it’s homeless families, or arts cutbacks,
or public policy issues. We hear or see something, our hearts are touched,
our minds open. Sometimes our checkbooks do, too.
Whether we wind up helping as a volunteer, joining a staff, or serving on a
board, we align with an agency because we believe in what it is doing, first
and foremost. And at some point, assisting the agency means trying to help
the nonprofit get the funding it needs to keep the doors open, keep the serv-
ices coming, and get people help. We realize that somebody has to raise
funds. You may be reading this book now because you are “the somebody”
that your organization is counting on.
But there’s no way around it — fundraising today is a challenge. Agencies have
incredible competition for the donor’s dollars. Volunteers, staff, and board
members come and go, which means that there’s always a new crop of people
to train. As the media — print, broadcast, and Internet — gets faster and more
insistent, we find ourselves competing with all sorts of voices clamoring for
attention. How will we get our agency noticed? Who will we approach? What
do we have to do to ensure our survival in the years to come?
Fundraising For Dummies, 2nd Edition, answers those questions with practi-
cal, tried-and-true offerings, friendly insights, and colorful examples. Whether
you run a one-person office or chair a 20-member board of directors, this
book walks you through the process of getting ready to raise funds, preparing
a far-reaching fundraising plan, gathering your resources, and putting the
plan in place. Additionally, you discover a wealth of fundraising tools and dis-
cover how you can use them most effectively.
About This Book
This is the type of book you can dip into to find just what you need. You don’t
have to read it cover to cover to get value. If you know all about what’s cov-
ered in Chapter 2, skip ahead and get what you need in Chapter 10.

We do suggest that you read over Chapter 1, which gives you some fundrais-
ing basics, including some basic terminology. But then wander where your
interests and most urgent needs lead you. When more information about a
topic is included elsewhere in the book we include a cross-reference, so you
can easily jump over there to beef up on the areas that interest you most.
Throughout the book we strive to make ideas and lingo easy to understand,
putting things in simple terms with advice straight from the school of fund-
raising hard knocks. The idea is to get you going with effective fundraising
techniques fast.
Conventions Used in This Book
There are a few conventions we’ve used consistently throughout the book
that you should know about.
 New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
What You’re Not to Read
Sidebars are just that — side topics that may be intriguing but aren’t exactly
essential to getting familiar with the topic of fundraising. They may point out
the background of a term or practice, for example. If you want to speed
through and skip sidebars, go ahead, no guilt required.
Foolish Assumptions
We’ve gone ahead and made some assumptions about our readers in writing
this book. We think that
 You’re a current or aspiring fundraiser.
 Whether you have 20 years of experience or are just starting out, you’d
like some fresh ideas and advice.
2
Fundraising For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

 You may be anyone from a full-time staff member to a volunteer charged
with fundraising tasks.
 You don’t have a huge staff or open-ended budget.
 You have a mission that you are raising funds for that is important to you.
 You don’t have time to waste; you need to get to work right away with
ideas and tools that can help you succeed.
How This Book Is Organized
Fundraising For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is organized into six different parts,
with chapters arranged to walk you (more or less) through the process of
preparing for, creating, implementing, and evaluating a cohesive fundraising
system.
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising 
Ducks in a Row
Part I is all about your readiness — as an agency — to set up a fundraising
system. Long before you start taking those checks to the bank, you need to
make sure that your organization is ready to raise funds. What is your mis-
sion? Why do you do what you do? Who is helped by your agency? What
does your board do? This part of the book will help you evaluate these ques-
tions — and more besides — to make sure that you are, in fact, ready to roll
out your own fundraising plan.
Part II: Finding — and Winning 
Over — Donors
Part II introduces that all-important person: your donor. Who are your donors
and where can you find them? What motivates a donor to give? How can you
lessen your chances of hearing “No!” on your donor calls? How equitable is
the agency-donor relationship? This part introduces you to these aspects of a
fundraising system and helps you play donor and agency roles to prepare for
your — eventual — dialog with the donor.

Introduction

Part III: Assembling Your 
Fundraising Toolkit
If you are new to fundraising, you may be thrilled to discover that there are
actual tools that will help you be successful on the job. Yes, everybody needs
a stapler, but that’s not the kind of tool we’re talking about here. You have at
your disposal dozens of ways in which you can get — and keep — attention
for your agency, whether that attention translates into volunteer hours, funds
raised, grants awarded, or successful phone campaigns. This part helps you
take advantage of those resources and put them to work for you.
Part IV: Leveraging the Internet
It’s an online world today, and your organization had better be up to the chal-
lenge. Everybody who’s anybody has a Web site, and so should you. In this part,
you discover the ins and outs of how to maximize your Web site to promote and
brand your group and even collect donations online. You explore the possi-
bilities of e-newsletters and e-mail for gaining visibility and soliciting funds.
Part V: On the (Fundraising) 
Campaign Trail
As you become acclimated to the fundraising environment, you quickly dis-
cover that different campaigns are run for different purposes and there are
different types of donors. Your year-in, year-out operations are funded by
your annual fund. A special event might purchase new playground equip-
ment. The new library building goes up on the dollars raised for the capital
campaign. You can go after major gifts from corporations and foundations, or
decide to build an endowment for longer-term financial security. This part
explores the different campaigns and approaches to fund building and pro-
vides advice about when you should use each, what to expect, and how to
sidestep trouble when it comes walking your way.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In typical For Dummies fashion, this part of the book lists a collection of ten
items, grouped around a particular subject. Some will be tongue in cheek;
4
Fundraising For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

others will be vital. Whichever the case, be sure to read through the ones
that suit you best. You may want to start with “Ten Great Opening Lines.” You
never know when one may come in handy.
Icons Used in This Book
If you have ever used a For Dummies book before, you know that each book
has a lot of little pictures stuck on the pages, showing you what’s special and
important about a particular paragraph. The icons used to represent what is
special and important vary from book to book. Here are the icons we’ve
chosen to include in Fundraising For Dummies, 2nd Edition.
Basic “how-to-do-it-better” ideas appear with this icon so you can do things
correctly from the start.
We use a “remember-this” icon for concepts and practical information.
Steer clear of the information listed with this icon, or your fundraising cam-
paign could be a bomb.
Where to Go from Here
Well, you could take the afternoon off and go watch the Cubs play . . . but
more than likely you are now fired up and ready to tackle some of the fund-
raising issues you face. Before you begin, however, review the following
fundraising truths:
 Fundraising starts with passion.
 People want to give.
 You help donors achieve their goals.
 Fundraising is a noble endeavor.
Don’t believe it? By the time you’re done reading, you will. In the meantime,
sit back, feel confident that you’re not alone out there, and enjoy your trip
through Fundraising For Dummies, 2nd Edition.

in a Row

In this part . . .
B
efore you can start bringing in the big bucks to fund
your organization, you need to know some of the
basics about effective fundraising. In this part, you get an
up-close look at the foundation of your fundraising efforts.
Where’s your passion? What’s your mission? Who’s on
your board? How good are you at mobilizing volunteers
for fundraising? Use this part to answer these basic 
questions and put your fundraising house in order.

Chapter 1
Identifying the Fruits of Your
Fundraising Passion
In This Chapter
 Finding the spark that brought you to nonprofit work
 Delving into nonprofit organizations
 Uncovering money sources
F
undraising folks have an old saying: “People don’t give to causes. People
give to people with causes.” This saying means that, in essence, you’re
the important part. Your inspiration, your perspiration, your passion. So that
brings us to the Big Question. . . .
What are you passionate about?
Chances are, passion for some cause led you to fundraising in the first place.
Oh, sure, you find professional fundraisers out in the field who are interested
first and foremost in turning a fast buck. But those people are few and far
between in our experience. People are drawn to organizations because they
see a need — perhaps up close and personal — and they feel compelled to do
what they can to make a difference.
That spark of passion makes you want to help. Your passion is one of the best
tools to use as you fan the embers of possibility into a full fundraising flame.
In this chapter, you take a look at having and staying in touch with that initial
spark — the spark that brought about the birth of your organization, the spark
that keeps it going, and the spark you caught and are helping to flame. We
also show you how to fan the flame to ignite others for your cause, give you
the rundown on some basic fundraising lingo, and attach fundraising at large
to a dollar figure (so you know just how vast the industry is). And for new-
bies just breaking into the nonprofit world, we highlight the various types of
these organizations, give you some advice on maintaining the buzz, and share
a few tips for the road on marketing your new venture.

Sparking Fundraising Action
As anyone who’s ever had any experience with trying to raise money can
attest, fundraising isn’t a pretty word. In fact, it’s a tough term to confront, a
kind of “oh-no-here-comes-the-pitch” sounding word. Some people say that
fundraising is really “friend-raising,” but that’s like putting a bit of polish on
an otherwise slippery word.
Nonetheless, fundraising is a necessary part of a nonprofit organization —
the part that puts the hinges on the doors so it can open and the part that
keeps the blankets on the beds and the food in the pantry. It pays the salary
for the midwife and provides the day-camp scholarships for inner-city kids.
But fundraising isn’t the main objective of a nonprofit organization, although
you may sometimes feel that it gets the bulk of the focus. Fundraising is the
means to the end, the way of fulfilling your mission, whether that mission is
reaching homeless people in need, healing the sick, or promoting the art or
music you’re passionate about.
Chapter 2 deals with the important issue of ethics in fundraising — how you
think about what you do. In that chapter, you consider the biases, apologies,
and reactions that you battle against — within yourself and from the general
population — when you set out to raise funds.
Remembering why you signed on
You may be involved with fundraising today, or you may be considering a
request for involvement, but the initial spark is what we’re talking about here.
Like the Olympic flame, your spark gets carried from person to person and
warms the very lifeblood of your organization, whether you’re a volunteer,
staff member, or board member.
Knowing your spark story is important for several reasons:
 When you share it, it inspires others.
 When you remember it, it inspires you.
 When you recognize its importance, it helps you remember your priorities.
 When you keep it in mind, it provides a common ground where you can
meet — and enlist help from — others you bring into your organization’s
cause.
10
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

Some people work with many different organizations at the same time. If
you’re charged with fundraising for your nonprofit group — whether your
role is a volunteer, paid staff member, or board member — chances are that
you work with a select few, just given the amount of time and effort that solid
fundraising requires. Even if you work with several nonprofit organizations,
take time to remember why you selected them over others. Knowing why you
care about these causes is important to keeping you motivated — even if
you’re overextended, time- and responsibility-wise.
Helping your donor catch the spark
We talk in this chapter about the importance of knowing what brought you to
nonprofit work in the first place. That spark shows in your eyes and your
smile. It carries in your voice and makes your story ring true. It shows in the
manner in which you promote your organization and in the personal pride
you take in your relationship to your work or your cause. This section pre-
sents a few key fundraising philosophies and tools that can help your donor
catch the spark that you hold. For more specifics about working with donors,
visit the chapters in Part II of this book.
The best thing you can do for your donor is believe in the mission you’re rep-
resenting. When you’re gung-ho for your cause, others see it and are encour-
aged to join. They start to imagine themselves working for a solid cause, a
good effort, a positive change.
Today’s philanthropy realizes that you can’t always see or touch the person
who needs the help. Nonprofit organizations arose to help people help others
11
Chapter 1: Identifying the Fruits of Your Fundraising Passion
You’ve lost that loving feeling
If you feel that you’ve lost your initial spark or
haven’t really analyzed what brings you to the
cause you’re helping to promote, ask yourself
the following questions and then see if that
spark doesn’t reignite (and if it doesn’t, you
probably need to find a different cause to get
involved with):
 When did I first become involved with this
organization?
 What brought me here?
 What did I think was important about this
cause?
 Why did I decide to help?
 What was going on in my life at the time that
this appealed to me?
 How can I help others see what I see?

whether they live down the block or on the other side of the world. These orga-
nized bodies provide the channels for your help to get to Rwandan refugees,
Kosovan orphans, or the homeless families in your neighborhood, which
enables you to do something concrete to help change the world for the better.
As a fundraiser, remember that you’re the all-important link that helps a caring
donor give to others. When you view what you do in this way, you recognize
the importance of your role as a service provider. You also see how that
spark can pass from one to another. And suddenly, the conversation is no
longer about simply raising funds.
Making friends with fundraising
Before going any further, we need to clearly define the terms we bat around
in fundraising. We offer the following definitions, with our own commentary
added. You see and hear these terms again and again as you proceed to raise
money for the causes you believe in:
 Philanthropy: Actions and giving that attempt to improve the lot of people.
In the fundraising field, one standard definition of philanthropy is “vol-
untary action for the public good,” meaning any action one takes — with
or without a financial component — that is an act to make life better for
someone else. When you tithe at church, it’s philanthropy. When you
drop coins in the container on the counter at the local convenience
store, you’re a philanthropist. When you include your local theater or
your alma mater in your will, you’re practicing philanthropy.
12
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
How many people volunteer?
Do you think that volunteering is only for those
few people who don’t have any other commit-
ments? Think again. The Independent Sector, a
coalition of nonprofits, foundations, and corpo-
rations supporting philanthropy, cites the fol-
lowing statistics in its 2001 study, which
surveyed more than 4,000 Americans:
 Eighty-nine percent of households give
money to charitable organizations.
 Forty-four percent of adults volunteer their
time.
 Forty-two percent of adults both gave and
volunteered.
 15.5 billion hours were spent volunteering
nationwide.

 Gift: Something you offer to somebody else with no thought of 
compensation.
A gift may appear in many facets of life. When Aunt Mildred gives you
her parakeet, it’s a gift. In fundraising, a gift may mean that any number
of things that build on this basic definition.
• You may hear about a lead gift, which is the first, usually sizeable,
gift of a capital campaign. Go to Chapter 20 for more about capital
campaigns.
• A major gift is another type of large gift that a donor may give in
order to support a particular program, launch a campaign, further
a cause, or be applied in another specific area. Check out Chapter
21 for more on major gifts.
• A general gift is one a donor gives to an annual fund or contributes
to operating expenses.
Still, a gift is a gift, freely given, with no theoretical arm-twisting and no
product or service given in return.
 Fundraising: Collecting money for a cause.
Another definition may be as follows: Fundraising is the intentional and
strategic activity of acquiring contributions for support and growth.
Those contributions can include money, time, services, labor, donations
of hard goods, or in-kind contributions.
 Volunteer: One who freely gives of his or her time to render a service.
In other words, at a basic level, a volunteer is someone who works for
no monetary payment. As a volunteer, you get other benefits — the abil-
ity to help build something you believe in, acquire new skills, forge new
relationships, and more. Head to Chapter 4 for more on finding and
recruiting volunteers.
 Annual Fund: A yearly fundraising effort.
Most organizations run a yearly fundraising campaign, in addition to any
program specific efforts. This annual fund is often earmarked for ongo-
ing operational expenses. See Chapter 18 for more about annual funds.
 Endowment: A substantial fund that generates ongoing income from its
investment.
An endowment is usually a large sum of money that can be invested, and
the profits from those investments, or even the interest the money gen-
erates, help to support an organization. See Chapter 23 to discover more
about how endowments work.

Chapter 1: Identifying the Fruits of Your Fundraising Passion

Fundraising today — and in the future
Fundraising is Big Business. In 2004, the American Association of Fundraising
Counsel (www.aafrc.org) released fundraising figures for 2003 in the latest
edition of Giving USA, the annual report on philanthropy in the United States.
Total contributions to nonprofit organizations weighed in at $241 billion, a 2.8
percent increase over amounts in the year 2000. You may think that’s one
heck of a lot of hot meals. Or free condoms. Or community leadership semi-
nars. Or tithes.
When you look at the societal statistics about who fundraisers are, where
fundraising is going, and where you spend both your energies and your dol-
lars, you may be surprised to find that Americans are living in a philanthropic
age. Americans volunteer their time; they give blood; they write checks; they
build houses. In this time of media hype, “negativism,” and preoccupation with
social ills, just seeing the flip side of that negativity in increased involvement,
higher levels of giving, and a greater number of human service organizations —
of all different flavors, springing up to make life better for generations today
and tomorrow — is reaffirming.
We are also at a time when fundraising is changing. For example, giving is
becoming more global, with gifts given across borders at times of national
strife such as disastrous weather or terrorist attacks. Estate planning will
grow as baby boomers retire and determine where to leave their wealth.
These and other trends make this an interesting time in the world of fundrais-
ing. (See Chapter 24 for more predictions about future trends in fundraising).
Building Nonprofit Organizations
The nonprofit organizations (NPOs) you care about were born from passion —
a response to an identified need in the local, national, or international com-
munity. The very frame of philanthropy rests on the idea that “when people
work together, they are stronger” — that when you share your resources,
14
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Philanthropy as a right
Although philanthropy isn’t a new concept, U.S.
residents get an additional perk when they give
that residents of other countries don’t: The
United States is the first country in the world to
include a fundamental philosophy that encour-
ages charitable giving. When you give, you get
a tax break. That’s not some loophole that some-
one figured out how to wriggle through — it’s
intentional. Lawmakers highly regarded the
practice of philanthropy. It’s part of your her-
itage. It’s part of your right — and, some would
say, part of your obligation.

whether those resources are your wealth, time, effort, or ideas, others can
benefit. Basically when people provide help, comfort, education, and more to
people in need, society as a whole benefits. But putting together solutions is
hard work — and passion and hard work are essential ingredients to carry
the idea from that initial spark of recognized need to the realization of a pro-
gram that achieves its mission.
Recognizing the many nonprofits
NPOs exist to battle every imaginable ill — from environmental to health to
human service issues. And don’t forget animals, arts, and political groups.
Your organization undoubtedly falls into one of the following categories:
 Arts/cultural organizations
 Educational organizations
 Environmental organizations
 Health organizations
 International aid and relief organizations
 Public policy/social benefit organizations
 Religious organizations
 Social service organizations
15
Chapter 1: Identifying the Fruits of Your Fundraising Passion
What about political fundraising?
You may notice that in this chapter (and even
book) we don’t mention the fundraising your
favorite political candidate does in order to
secure your vote and fund his or her trip to
office. Political fundraising is the unappreciated
stepchild of the fundraising field. Because of
widely publicized political fundraising abuses,
people sometimes blame fundraising for cor-
rupting or, at least, preoccupying the minds and
intentions of candidates.
In fact, if political fundraising would more
openly apply the good practices and ethics
used in charitable fundraising, the standards
would improve, the money would be raised, and
good people of varying income brackets could
get into office. The areas aren’t so different,
after all: When you raise funds in the nonprofit
world, you’re working for a cause you care
about. When you raise funds for a political can-
didate, you believe in the person or the platform.
The skills you discover in nonprofit fundraising
are directly transferable to the political arena —
and may lead you to contribute to the public
debate and thus to the political system.

All in all, more than 1.23 million charitable organizations are in the United
States, (give or take a few hundred), according to the Independent Sector’s
survey, “Giving and Volunteering in the United States.” Luckily, there are also
millions of people wanting to help, most of whom are also willing to give.

Three nonprofits built from passion
Looking at examples of how passion has been
at the core of fundraising efforts can be enlight-
ening and inspiring. Here are a few:
 MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving)
was created when mom Candy Lightner lost
her 13-year-old daughter Cari in an accident
caused by a repeat-offender drunken driver.
Though it benefited from a few large corpo-
rate gifts at its inception, the organization
continues to be largely a grass-roots orga-
nization calling for heightened awareness
and tougher punishments for alcohol- or
drug-impaired drivers. MADD has grown to
more than three million members world-
wide because of Candy’s original passion,
her perceived need for an organized effort
to combat drunk driving, and the spark that
spread to others. What’s amazing about
MADD is that it illustrates perfectly what
passion applied to a cause can do: Beyond
simply growing in numbers, MADD grew in
voice, becoming instrumental in changing
the values and very perspectives with
which people view drinking and driving in
today’s culture. You can visit the MADD
Web site at www.madd.org.
 Habitat for Humanity grew out of a passion
sparked in the mid-1960s when founders
Millard and Linda Fuller visited Koinonia
Farm, a small, cooperative farming commu-
nity in Georgia. There they began discus-
sions with farmer and scholar Clarence
Jordan about the possibility of partnership
housing, in which those in need of homes
would work together with volunteers to
build solid, affordable homes. Since
Habitat’s founding in 1976, more than
200,000 homes have been built in more than
100 countries. Check out the Habitat Web
site at www.habitat.org.
Some years ago, John (one of your humble
authors) had the good fortune to meet
Millard Fuller and spend some time with
him. He shared his vision of how people
become unified in a good cause. Whether
the volunteers who range from doctors,
construction workers, healthcare profes-
sionals, or stay-at-home parents pick up the
tools and drive the first nail, they’re joined
together in work that helps build a life. His
challenge, said Millard, was to get people
to hammer that first nail.
 The spark that would flame into the
Children’s Defense Fund was ignited in
Marian Wright Edelman during her work as
a private civil rights lawyer in Mississippi in
1964. According to her book, The Measure
of Our Success (HarperCollins), she began
a fight for the hungry, homeless, illiterate,
and economically disadvantaged children
as her primary focus. Today the Children’s
Defense Fund has celebrated its 30th
anniversary and is an active advocate for
the child on the local and national level. You
can find the Children’s Defense Fund on the
Web at www.childrensdefense.org.

Competing for dollars
So if tons of people are giving, then doesn’t it follow that many people are
also receiving? How many people are doing what fundraisers do — raising
funds for your various NPOs? How many of these organizations exist today,
and how does that compare to a decade ago? In other words, what does your
competition for fundraising dollars look like?
The IRS reports that the number of charities that filed tax returns with the
government rose from 180,931 in 1995 to 240,559 in 2001. That’s a pretty hefty
growth in only six years! By comparison, between 1999 and 2000 the number
of private foundations filing during that period grew 7 percent, for a total of
66,738.
So what form do all these nonprofit organizations take? Typically, your com-
petition will be one of two kinds:
 501(c)(3) is one section of the IRS code that defines and qualifies non-
profit organizations for special treatment under today’s tax laws. Having
501(c)(3) status allows nonprofits to be tax-exempt and to accept dona-
tions for which donors receive tax deductions. A nonprofit with
501(c)(4) status is a nonprofit in the social welfare arena.
 Independent sector, or third sector, is a phrase used to describe the
group of charitable organizations that include both 501(c)(3)s and
501(c)(4)s.
17
Chapter 1: Identifying the Fruits of Your Fundraising Passion
A mixed bag of contributions
Many nonprofits receive funds from a variety of
contributors. An arts organization, for example,
raises a percentage of its funds by selling tickets
for its exhibits, applies for grant monies from
selected foundations, solicits both charitable con-
tributions and in-kind gifts from corporations, and
develops a planned giving program to help long-
time donors work out bequests that continue to
fund the organization after the death of the donor.
(See Chapter 21 for more on planned giving.)
In some agencies, especially those involved 
in health and human services, government
funding is a part of the package. Other NPOs
sell a product and thereby are responsible for
some taxable income in addition to their chari-
table contributions.
Whatever the funding patterns for your organi-
zation may be, get to know your income
sources. Evaluate them, assess them, and know
where your strengths and challenges lie.
Strengthening this part of your program can
help you discover major funding possibilities
that you may be missing now.

Although the increasing number of 501(c)(3)s is a good thing, which spot-
lights the growing awareness of and responsiveness to human need, a down-
side to all this growth exists: increased competition. Missions overlap. Differ-
ent organizations seek to serve the same populations. Donors are pulled in
different directions, recognizing that their dollars may be coveted by a
number of similar organizations addressing similar needs.
The sad fact is that a nonprofit mortality rate does exist. Each year, nonprof-
its fold up their 501(c)(3) umbrellas and disappear. The level of competition
for today’s fundraising dollars means survival of the fittest. In order to sur-
vive, you need to stay on your toes, ready for anything. Sometimes you may
even ask yourself, “Is this service worthwhile? Are there other organizations
repeating our services?”
Keeping your organization going
What does this competition mean to you? For starters, if you want to keep
your agency active and growing:
 Know your mission statement inside and out. A crystal-clear “why are
we here?” mission statement (also called a case statement) helps keep
everyone focused on the organization’s vision. If your statement’s lan-
guage is outdated, be willing to speak in terms that reach your con-
stituents’ hearts. See Chapter 3 for more on creating this case statement.
 Be different. Be sure that you stay plugged into your environment. Be
active in local fundraising groups — know who else serves the popula-
tion you serve. When possible, work with, as opposed to against, other
agencies so that you both can complement and not duplicate each other.
Then you need to differentiate your cause from other similar organiza-
tions: Many opportunities abound for giving, but not so many that dupli-
cating services is okay — at least not for the long term.
 Know what’s out there.
 Be responsive to the people you serve. The ever-changing world pre-
sents you with opportunities for refocusing and retooling at every turn.
If the social ill you battle is no longer viable, step back and reconsider
your clients’ needs.
 Ask the tough questions. Does your organization meet today’s needs?
For instance, 50 years ago, an agency created to provide lodging to
unmarried pregnant women was much needed. In today’s climate, pro-
grams exist in many places to help young women, and single pregnancy
no longer carries the same crippling social stigma it once did. An organi-
zation that asks itself the hard questions, such as whether what it’s
18
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

doing is really necessary and then changes based on the answers, won’t
be left in the dust when the world around it continues to grow.
 Be willing to change. Yep. You read it right. After you answer those
tough questions about your organization, you have to be willing to make
the necessary changes. Especially for large, unwieldy organizations with
a vested power structure and a bureaucratic bent, change is resisted at
the board table. But populations, needs, and services change. Be willing
to change with them. Doing so can help protect your agency’s existence.
 Put your best foot forward. People generally dislike crisis appeals — if
you’re always crying “Wolf!” to bring in funding from various donors,
sooner or later people are going to tire of the continual pleas. Instead, if
you can show your donors that you’re part of a winning organization, a
force that works for good in the world, you may not only keep their
interest but also inspire them to join you in your winning campaign. (See
Chapter 7 for ways to show and tell your cause to donors.)
Getting Attention — and Money
So just how do you get started raising funds? You can approach fundraising
in several different ways, all of which we discuss in various chapters of this
book. If you read Parts I and II and you perform the outlined groundwork to
understand your own mission and goals and research potential donors, then
you’re ready to spread the word and ask for contributions.
To help with those contributions, review Part III for a discussion on using
print materials and direct mail, writing grant proposals, working with the
media, and fundraising over the phone. Part IV looks at ways you can lever-
age the online world to run e-mail campaigns, to keep people aware of your
mission with an e-newsletter, or to offer information on your own Web site.

Chapter 2
Finding the Right Perspective:
Fundraising Issues and Ethics
In This Chapter
 Selling or inspiring? 
 Replacing fundraising myths with realities
 Getting an ethics overview
T
he happiest fundraisers love what they do. They believe in their cause,
and an air of invincibility surrounds them. They may not be the biggest
moneymakers on the block right now, but something inside them recognizes
that one day they may be. They have the power of belief, the pride of profes-
sion, that inner conviction that what they do makes a difference.
That’s one place where your spark comes in handy.
This chapter explores the issues that may hang you up when you first begin
fundraising. Not only is the understandable dread of asking someone for
money something to combat (nobody we know is too fond of rejection) but
also a kind of built-in stigma exists — deep, in those unspoken attitudes we
have about money — that comes with the territory. Here you find out how to
face some of those demons head-on and recognize that they are simply mis-
guided impressions you may have about fundraising. When you shine the
light on those demons, they disappear like the illusions they are.

Sacrificing or Selling: The Fundraising
Debate Continues
Part of the stigma of fundraising is a social issue. We used to shy away from
talking about things like sex, religion, and money. Today we’re still shy about
religion and money. Taboos keep the reins on too much familiarity, keeping
us from asking “prying” questions about another’s finances, barring us from
being so bold as to “peek” into another person’s checkbook while we’re
standing in the checkout line at the grocery store. The person who does that
for a living is, so the unspoken perception goes, violating a kind of personal
privacy we each, as individuals, want.
Another part of the stigma is simply bad rep (as in reputation). To illustrate,
we’ll tell you a story:
Jimmy is a part-time used car salesman. He knows every trick in the book for
getting you to buy that car. He overlooks the fact that the car has lemon writ-
ten all over it. He somehow blinks away the idea that he’s trying to sell you a
two-seater and you’ve got a family of five. He nods understandingly when you
tell him that you were barely able to pay your electric bill last month and cer-
tainly don’t need a little yellow sports car that will put you even further into
debt. As you sign the purchase agreement, he smiles a big smile, assuring you
that all your troubles will just blow away as you do 90 mph through the
desert. His gold tooth gleams.
Jimmy isn’t a fundraiser. And he’s not an ethical car salesman, either. Jimmy
is interested in one thing: getting your money. And that’s not what’s at the
front of a fundraiser’s mind. All the textbooks and professional organizations
will tell you: Fundraising is a noble endeavor. People who have been in this
business for the span of their careers affirm it: Good work gets done; doors get
opened; programs help, heal, feed, and house because of the dollars they raise.
In business, we don’t blanche when we read books that exalt the salesperson.
A sale, after all, provides the lifeblood of a business. In sales, you might
argue, you have an exchange of goods or services. In fundraising, you have
an opportunity for people to walk the talk of their beliefs.
Telephone solicitors who call in the middle of dinnertime can hardly be
accused of altruistic behavior. Who knows, though? Maybe they’re giving up
their dinner to call.
22
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

Living with the stigma
If fundraising is such a noble profession, where does the fundraiser’s black
eye come from?
Unfortunately, for some people, the word fundraising means, “I’ll try anything
to get your money.” This mentality taints the fundraising process for all fund-
raisers who then have to get past that stigma when approaching possible
donors.
For ethical fundraisers, doing whatever it takes to get money couldn’t be far-
ther from the truth. Instead, you offer potential donors not the sale of a prod-
uct or a palpable “warm fuzzy,” but rather the opportunity to join a group of
people working in an area you care about. You offer a chance to make a differ-
ence, an opportunity to “start where you are, use what you have, and do
what you can,” as the saying goes.
An ethical fundraiser doesn’t sell a lemon of an organization to a donor. So, to
be an ethical fundraiser, you need to remember that
 The match needs to be right between the donor and the organization.
 The donor needs to have the ability to give (if the electric bill was a
problem last month, major philanthropic giving is out of the question
this month).
 The transaction that takes place has to be a good one for both parties
because this is the beginning of a long-term relationship, not a hit-and-
run experience in which the fundraiser stuffs the check in his pocket
and heads on down the road, grinning his gold-toothed smile.
Combining selling with ideals
Parts of fundraising are similar to — and informed by — good salesmanship.
You need to develop certain skills to be a good salesperson: 
 Communicating with your customer 
 Being a good listener 
 Helping a customer find the right fit 
 Closing the deal
23
Chapter 2: Finding the Right Perspective: Fundraising Issues and Ethics

In fundraising, these skills translate into
 Communicating your mission and passion to your donor
 Listening to your donor’s concerns and interests
 Helping your donors find the giving level and program that match their
interests
 Getting the donation so it can start doing good right away
Use tools of research that help you prospect for the people who will care
about your cause (you can discover more about these tools in Chapter 6). If
you identify people who have a real interest, then approaching them isn’t sell-
ing them something they don’t want; it’s providing a connection they crave.
If you can see sales as an honorable profession, you can embrace the need for
using sales skills in an honorable way to fundraise with even more conviction.
Do some people work for organizations they don’t believe in? Sure. But if
you’re reading this book and want to grow in your professional or volunteer
ability to fundraise, we assume that you’re willing to make the investment of
time and effort you need in order to master the art of fundraising. Even if
you’re not crazy about what you do right now, you can benefit by acquiring
the skills you need for the day when you’re working in a cause that really gets
those fires raging.
Understanding the Ethics of Fundraising
If you caught the spark of fundraising as a noble endeavor, start talking about
the standards by which you determine the “right” ways to fundraise. If you’re
new to the area of fundraising, perhaps involved for the first time through
volunteer efforts, board membership, or a new development job, you may be
beginning to soak up some of the attitudes present in nonprofit work. You’ll
find that ethics and accountability are important ideas in the nonprofit sector.
What are ethics? And what do they have to do with our views about what we
do? Ethics deal with the study of what’s right and wrong and developing a moral
code you can live by. Everybody in every walk of life at some time or other has
to measure what they do for a living with what they feel is right and wrong.
Finding ethical standards organizations
So who sets the ethical standards for fundraising, and how are they governed?
A number of professional organizations exist to help set the standards we use
24

to guide ethics in fundraising. You can contact these organizations to find out
about membership and meetings in your area:
 Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP): AFP is a professional
association of individuals responsible for generating donor support for a
wide variety of nonprofit charitable organizations. With more than 172
chapters, AFP is the largest (26,000 members) professional organization
in fundraising today.
AFP includes chapters in all major cities, nationwide. Groups meet
monthly to discuss issues with their peers, hear speakers, and find out
more about their craft and their industry. Contact your local AFP office

Chapter 2: Finding the Right Perspective: Fundraising Issues and Ethics
Paid by commission: A hot ethical topic
One issue continually batted about by profes-
sional fundraisers — those working in develop-
ment for an organization and those serving as
consultants — is whether a grant proposal
writer should be paid by commission. Industry
ethics say no. In fact, in the 501(c)(3) language,
it says “no part of the net earnings of which
inures to the benefit of any private shareholder
or individual.” In at least one interpretation, this
means our income should not be directly tied to
the funds we raise.
The argument for paying grant proposal writers
a percentage comes from those cases when a
small organization needs a good grant writer in
order to secure major funds to keep the doors
open. (Other things should be in place here, but
let’s stick with the percentages discussion.) If a
grant proposal writer is paid a percentage after
the grant is made, the organization can defer
payment until it secures the funds and the grant
proposal writer is paid what she’s “worth.”
Although this argument continues and many
consultants — especially for small organiza-
tions — do agree to work for percentages, this
position is considered unethical by professional
fundraising organizations.

Familiarizing yourself with 
the fundraiser’s credo
As you continue thinking about ethical and responsible approaches to
fundraising, you may want to familiarize yourself with some of the industry
standards:
 The document “A Donor Bill of Rights” was developed by a number of
the professional organizations (including the AAFRC, AHP, CASE, and
AFP). This document gives you an idea of the type of exchange valued in
an ethical relationship between donor and organization. It’s worth taking
the time to read the most current version online (go to the Web site of
the AFP — www.afpnet.org — to read the full document). Notice how
many of the items have to do with clear, honest communication between
parties.
 Another standard established by the National Committee on Planned
Giving (NCPG) details the practices that should be following by ethical
charitable gift planners. Check out the “Model Standards of Practice
for the Charitable Gift Planner,” available on the NCPG Web site:
www.ncpg.org.

Debunking Fundraising Myths
This section exposes four myths of fundraising that can hinder fundraisers
from optimal performance in their work. Building on the idea that fundraising
is a noble profession and that professional ethics drive what you do, you can
set about getting rid of some of these attitudes — your own or those of
others — by imagining yourself in the anecdotes in the following list. The 
attitudes reflected in these anecdotes aren’t unethical; rather, they are close
calls that depend on your attitude about what you do and how clearly you
understand your priorities. Following each myth, we propose some ethical
guidelines for that type of situation.
The four myths of fundraising covered in the following sections can really get
in your way when trying to solicit those donations, so dispel them now!
Myth #1: It’s all about the money
Some people say fundraisers only care about money, others consider that
fundraisers care about helping others. Which is true?
Making money the whole point
You have a lunch appointment with Mrs. M. You have spoken on the phone
with her twice in preparation for this face-to-face meeting, and both times
Mrs. M. sounded pleasant but cautious. You review your notes from your
donor files as you drive to her house: her personal net worth, her other phil-
anthropic interests, and her personal information. You know that she was
widowed last year and that two months ago her son Ted made a substantial
contribution to the capital campaign of his alma mater. As you pull into the
landscaped drive, you return the donor file to your briefcase — no need for
her to see your resource materials as the two of you drive to the restaurant.
You ring the bell and the housekeeper answers. She asks you into the foyer.
Moments later, Mrs. M. comes down the stairs. She smiles and extends her
hand. You shake her hand and introduce yourself; then compliment her on
the dress she’s wearing. She flashes you a wry gaze. Perhaps the dress com-
ment was too much, you think. Oh come on, her glance tells you. We both
know this is all about money. What will you do to show Mrs. M. otherwise?
27
Chapter 2: Finding the Right Perspective: Fundraising Issues and Ethics

Sharing concerns and a willingness to help
Instead of being all about money — seeing the donor as a dollar amount —
fundraising is really about the relationship you create with another person —
a hand extended, saying “come join our cause.”
Not everyone shares your concerns about recycling, music, or the college of
your choice. Some people care more about political activism, fighting cancer,
finding homes for the marginalized, or getting runaway teens home. When
you find someone who shares your heart and welcomes your cause, you’ve
got a potential ally. With some good communication from you and the right
conditions for the giver (including a link to your cause, interest in what you’re
doing, and the ability and willingness to give), helping is a natural next step. 
Find the right connection with Mrs. M., one that benefits her as well as your
cause, and you can easily demonstrate that this relationship is about much
more than money.
If you believe that how you use your time is a sacred endeavor, then how you
spend your money, making that choice, is also a sacred endeavor. It’s noble
to raise money for something you care deeply about. But you still need to sit
back and reflect often on what you do.
Myth #2: Lying to get what you want
It’s sometimes tempting to tell a little lie or exaggerate to try to get to your
goal. In fundraising, insincere tactics don’t get you far in the long run. Is a
short-term leap in honesty worth a long-term donor relationship? See what
you think as you read this anecdote.
A white lie for a good cause is okay
You’re sitting with a board member at his house on a personal call with a
major donor. You’re beginning a capital campaign and hope to secure a lead
gift. Tom R. has a reputation for being a great local philanthropist — he has
supported everything from the arts to human services to education. Your
organization is one he has supported on lower levels for many years. But this
is the first time you have approached him for a major gift.
The conversation is not going as well as you had hoped. He is firing questions
at you left and right about specific uses of his gift and about guarantees that
it will be used the way he wants it to be. The focus from the board was spe-
cific about where lead gifts would go, but he wants a personal guarantee from
you that he will be able to determine how his money is used. You glance at
the board member; she says nothing. You decide to fudge a little, hoping you
28
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

can figure out what to do later. “Okay,” you say, finally. “If you’re willing to
agree to this lead gift today, we’ll let you choose the designation.”
What will you say to the board member when you get back out to the car?
How will you handle the situation when the donor realizes he can’t control
the way his funds are applied?
Slick may sell, but authenticity wins the day
The truth is, fundraising is actually a long-term activity. A firm hold on your
ethics and priorities, and a clear statement from your board about what to
accept and what to resist, helps you fight the temptation to “give in” when a
gift you’ve been pursuing is right in front of you and is yours for the taking —
if only you bend a little.
Fundraisers create opportunities for people who care to help others through
our organizations. Our ability to communicate that clearly, honestly, and 
with enthusiasm is not lying — that’s spark (see Chapter 1 to read more
about spark!).
The right thing to do with Mr. Major Donor in the preceding situation is to be
honest about what you can and can’t do; if you think the board would make
an exception, offer to ask them and get back to the donor tomorrow.
Myth #3: Your donor owes 
the world something
Do you go after donations with the attitude that people with money owe you
something? Or do you try to build a mutually beneficial relationship where
you and the donor help each other?
It’s about time the rich started giving to the poor
Elias Q. Smith has been the richest man in town since he inherited his family’s
fortune. He has a reputation for being miserly, and other fundraisers you’ve
known who have approached him have come back with their tails between
their legs. You made it a goal more than a year ago to approach Mr. Smith for
an upcoming campaign — you have worked extensively on building what you
think is a foolproof presentation.
When you arrive at his office, his secretary informs you that Mr. Smith is tied
up in meetings all afternoon and won’t be able to meet with you after all. He
has requested that you reschedule the appointment for another day. You tell
the secretary you’ll wait. She shakes her head and returns to her work. You
29
Chapter 2: Finding the Right Perspective: Fundraising Issues and Ethics

sit there, stewing about Mr. Smith’s miserly ways. It’s about time he gives some-
thing back, you think. It’s not right to sit on all that money and not do some-
thing with it.
What do you say when Mr. Smith opens the door after his current meeting
adjourns? Will the look on your face show your feeling of entitlement? How
much respect have you shown for Mr. Smith and his choices by not resched-
uling your appointment as he requested?
The best donations benefit both the giver and the organization 
People give for all kinds of reasons, and nothing is wrong with that. Maybe
the donor wants to be part of your organization because of a good experi-
ence he or she once had with the same type of organization. Maybe your
cause is good for his business. Maybe she wants the recognition a named
giving opportunity presents. Maybe he’s trying to prove something to his
mother. Who are we to question motives?
The most important thing to remember is that the donor/organization rela-
tionship is supposed to be a win-win arrangement (to use modern business-
speak). Both parties gain something. You create the relationship with a donor
who believes in your cause and can help you further it through money, good-
will, word of mouth, and maybe hands-on effort or in-kind donations. The
donor gets the satisfaction of helping a cause he believes in, maybe getting a
fountain named after him (or his mother), having something to tell the folks
at the Rotary club, and enjoying the warm fuzzies from having done some-
thing for his community.
The organization benefits from the donor’s gift or services, and continues
building the relationship by keeping the donor informed about the organiza-
tion, remembering to say thank you, and generally honoring the relationship.
Give Mr. Smith the chance to find out about what your organization does and
respect his right to make his own choice about whether there’s a match of
interests. If there’s not, thank him for his time to protect any future relation-
ship if he has a change of heart and move on.
30
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Some donors are shy
Some people have problems with the idea that
if they give to your organization, their name 
may be added to the engraved nameplate in 
the foyer. Some people aren’t comfortable with
banquets and recognitions and fountains and
programs named in their honor. These people
make great anonymous donors.

Myth #4: Wining and dining 
donors is all you do
Some folks consider that fundraisers spend their donor dollars on lengthy
lunches with major givers. The fact is that most fundraisers have to be very
accountable for the money that they spend and how they spend it. Which
side of the debate do you come down on?
Fundraisers schmooze for a living
You have a lunch scheduled every day this week. A new contact on Monday, 
a fellow fundraiser on Tuesday, a board member on Wednesday, a planned
gift prospect on Thursday, and your top giver for 2005 at Le Chateau (your
favorite!) on Friday. It’s going to be a great week. On your way to lunch, you
try not to think about the look on your executive director’s face when you
told her your lunch schedule.
“I’m concerned about the amount of money we’re spending to make money,”
she said. “I’d like to talk about this later this week.”
You shrug off the concern and have a pleasant lunch with the new donor. She
is actively involved in children’s issues and made a trip to Namibia last year
to visit an orphanage. The waiter brings the check and you pick it up quickly.
Your prospective donor glances at the credit card you pull from your wallet.
“Is the organization paying for this?” she asks. “Oh, of course,” you respond.
Her next question blindsides you. “Is that where my donation will go?”
Fundraisers are accountable for what they spend
Behind the “get-the-check-and-I’m-outta-here!” mindset is the slick manipula-
tor who has his eye on the cash rather than on the value it brings the organi-
zation. This type of fundraiser, you may think, is likely to use the funds for
the fancy lunches, the trips to St. John, and the pay raises he gives himself.
But in truth, nonprofits are called to a high level of accountability. The slick
manipulator probably wouldn’t get away with it. And the verification on non-
profits’ accountability is increasing all the time.
Before a foundation makes a grant in your direction, it wants to see what you
do with the money you have, what you’ve done in the past, and what you’re
planning to do in the future. Likewise, before a donor even gets close to
giving a major gift, she’s going to have her financial advisors and lawyers
check you out — look closely at your financial statements, your tax filings,
and the giving levels of your board.

Chapter 2: Finding the Right Perspective: Fundraising Issues and Ethics

The donor in this situation has a legitimate concern. You have two issues to
deal with here: one, see if there are ways in which you should cut down your
spending on lunch checks and so on; and two, explain the structure of your
fundraising budget and planning to show that, though a certain percentage of
operating funds go towards fundraising costs, the lion’s share of donations
support the actual programs.
As of June 1999, IRS rules require U.S. tax-exempt organizations to make avail-
able to the public copies of their exemption applications and their three most
recently filed annual information returns.

Your Agency’s Reason to Be
In This Chapter
 Understanding your case statement
 Putting together the core of your case statement
 Getting your case statement perfected
T
his chapter isn’t about writing grant proposals — you may read that in
Chapter 11. Nor is this chapter about making life interesting for board
members. Instead, this chapter is about something even more important —
the fabric from which all your other documents, including grant proposals,
are cut: the case statement.
You may not be — nor do you have any intention of becoming — an attorney,
but there’s something to be said for being able to make your case. When you
can describe the mission of your organization, your goals, your objectives,
your programs, your staff, and your plans, all in one cohesive, well-thought-out
document, your donors will be impressed. The people working with you will be
impressed. Even others in the fundraising community will be impressed. And
all the while, they’ll be thinking, “There’s an organization that has its act
together!”
Stating Your Case
Before you can write your case statement (see “Ten Steps to Writing the
Case,” later in this chapter), you need to understand what your case is and
how you use the case statement. This section lays the groundwork so you’re
prepared to state your case effectively.

Understanding what the case statement is
and how you use it
The case statement, done well, provides the basis for all your other pub-
lished materials as well. The message you generate in the case speaks for
itself through presentations, brochures, newsletters, annual reports, and
more. The tone, flavor, style, and focus of this information, carried from one
piece to the next, help build the identity for your organization. The fact that
you aren’t saying one thing in one way in this brochure and saying it another
way in that brochure won’t be lost on your potential donors. Consistency car-
ries a message.
Another use of the case — especially a good-looking case statement — is the
effect it leaves behind. You can’t be everywhere at once, and you can’t always
be the one to represent your organization. But when you want to put the best
face possible on your contact with your clients, you can visit them and then
leave your printed materials behind. A well-written and nicely produced case
statement gives the potential donor the facts of your organization — in more
detail than you can or would offer in a face-to-face meeting.
The case statement left behind serves as a reference to the donor: “What did
he say that their budget was for summer camp last year?” The case also pro-
vides a list of ways the donor can help your organization. The donor can —
and hopefully will — look through the materials to find out more about you,
your mission, your programs, your history, and your plans for the future.
A case statement is
 A clear statement of the need your agency addresses, how you address
it, what makes you unique, and how others can help
 A document you can use in drafting all your other publications and 
presentations
 An item that requires your board and staff to communicate with each
other about the central vision of the organization
A case statement is not
 Everything there is to know about a specific program
 Something the board uses to show off its talents
 A long-winded grant proposal
 A work of fiction
34
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

Getting started with your case statement
Unfamiliar with case statements? Don’t worry — here are some questions
people often ask as they begin to draft a case statement for the first time.
These inquiries give you a quick idea of what goes into a case statement:
 How long should the case statement be? This is an easy one: As long as
it needs to be. Now, before you start groaning, check out the steps in
“Ten Steps to Writing the Case” later in this chapter for a listing of the
items you need to include in your case statement. The actual length of
the sections themselves are determined by how much you have to say in
each one.
 How often should you write a case statement? Theoretically, you write
a case statement one time from scratch — but you update it as needed.
Because you have sections for programs, budget, and more, some parts
of your case may need revising every year. Other parts, such as the
staffing section or the history section, need revision less often, only as
changes warrant them.
 Who should write the case statement? Ideally, a person who has a clear
sense of the vision of your organization — someone with spark —
should write the case statement. But this type of writing can be difficult,
and the drier the text, the less likely donors and evaluators will make it
all the way through to the end. If you have someone on your board or
your staff who is a talented, lively writer, solicit that person’s services;
otherwise, draft the person most likely to get the job done and then
have a committee of reviewers go through the draft and offer opinions,
make suggestions, and add information as needed.
 Should you include pictures and charts in a case statement? Your
board or leadership group should decide the way in which you publish
your case, but, in general, it never hurts to look good. Don’t overwhelm
your readers by providing too many charts, using too many or conflict-
ing type styles, or shouting at them with headlines that are too big.
Simple and understated are best. But a few photos — especially of a pro-
gram in progress, your new facility, or your cheerful staff — can help hold
the reader’s interest and build a bit more recognition for your agency.
 Would your case statement make a good video? More and more, as the
cost of video production drops and computer capabilities increase, busi-
nesses and nonprofit organizations alike are beginning to put their mes-
sages on video. You can show the spark you want to communicate to
your viewers, linking images — emotional, hopeful, or heart-wrenching
images — with your cause in your donor’s mind. This can be helpful for
corporate and foundation grant applications, as well as introducing your
organization to potential donors in another state or country, or on
35
Chapter 3: Making Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be

another continent. Consider having your video play whenever some-
body hits your Web site (but provide a button to ‘Skip the Introduction’
for those who have seen it too many times).
 Should you make your case statement available on the Web?
Absolutely! The more information about your organization the better —
for both your donors and your organization. One suggestion, however:
Hold back any sensitive financial data from the general public eye.
Provide a link so that any visitors who want to see your financial data
can send you an e-mail request.
A new IRS ruling requires nonprofit corporations to make available their
exemption applications and three annual information reports. If you make
this available from the Web (in downloadable PDF format, perhaps), you can
save yourself the hours and expense of printing and mailing the documents
each time they’re requested.
Ten Steps to Writing the Case
Okay, are you ready to get your writing tools out and start writing that case
statement? No? You need to prepare to do a little stream-of-consciousness
writing.
First, get a legal pad and a sharp pencil, or sit down at your computer and
start your favorite word processing program.
This section assumes that you’re the person responsible for writing the case
statement — the first draft, anyway — and that the document will then be
reviewed by your board, your focus group (we talk about them later in this
chapter), and staff members you’ve selected to help with the review process.
Of course, if your organization does everything by committee and you’ll be
drafting the document as a team, take each of these steps, multiply them by
the number of people on the team, and pad whatever schedule you set for
your tasks (which will vary depending on your goal and the size of your orga-
nization) to provide extra time for each additional cook who will stir the pot.
When doing the first draft, write quickly. You can go back and correct or edit
later. Just get something down on paper. That’s the first step.
In the following steps, we walk you through the process of writing a case
statement, using the organization StreetReach, a young nonprofit that serves
homeless teenagers, as an example.
36
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

Step 1: The mission — why are you here?
The first step is to draft your mission statement. The best mission statements
all have a few things in common:
 They’re clear, concise, and easy to understand.
 They capture and hold the reader’s interest.
 They include a call to action that gives the reader a reason to respond now.
Your mission statement should draw readers in and hold their attention. Start
out strong. Be compelling. Describe the issue you’re addressing; then tell your
solution; then specifically describe your organization and show how it uniquely
addresses the problem you opened with. The process looks like this:
 Big picture (problem)
 Zooming in (solution)
 Close up (the specific ways in which your organization addresses the
problem)
Getting a clear view of your mission
Perhaps even more important than what the outside world will think of you is
what your organization understands about itself. Drafting a careful case state-
ment helps bring a wide range of thoughts into a focused purpose, which
enables everyone connected with your organization — donors included — 
to get a better picture of what you do and what you need.
For example, you know that it’s your organization’s mission “to identify and
reach out to disenfranchised teenagers in the Baltimore community, offering
fun, educational, and safe activities that help them build better relationships
with peers and parents.” But when asked about the mission of your organiza-
tion, here are some examples of how a few different board members respond:
“We’re here to serve the needs of youth.”
“We help teens in trouble.”
“We get kids off the street.”
Although none of the board members is dead wrong in the summary of your
mission, none of them hit the nail on the head, either. When people have dif-
ferent ideas of what the organization does, they may be pulled in different
directions, which can mean wasted effort, money, time, or something worse.
When you define, and stick to, a clear, specific mission for your organization,
you assure that everyone’s efforts are spent in pulling the organization down
the same path.
37
Chapter 3: Making Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be

Board members of StreetReach all have different ideas of what the agency is
all about. The agency hires Jane as its first full-time development director. (A
development director is in charge of fundraising for an organization.) One of
Jane’s responsibilities is to draft a case statement. Consider how Jane handled
each of the elements described in the preceding section in the StreetReach
mission statement:
 Big picture: Homeless teens. Living under bridges, in abandoned tene-
ments, in boxes and doorways in every major city nationwide. Homeless
teens often run away as young as 12, learn the prostitution trade weeks
later, and eat only every other day, surviving on the scraps left by those
who have homes, and families, and futures.
 Zooming in: You may want to think that a city as progressive as Baltimore
doesn’t have teenagers living on the streets. You may want to think that,
but you’d be closing your eyes to a real problem in our city today. Last
year more than 350 teenagers lived under bridges, in abandoned build-
ings, and in the doorways of our community. They lived on the streets
along with the shadows of drug addiction, horrendous poverty, illness,
depression, and the haunting nightmares of sexual abuse and exploitation.
 Close up: StreetReach is a 501(c)(3) organization that was started with
the simple mission of getting help for these kids — whether that means
connecting them with their families, giving them bus fare home, finding
sufficient counseling services, providing occupational training, or moving
them into transitional housing. StreetReach reaches out and offers a hand
and a heart to hurting teens, giving them a home, a chance, and the skills
they need to create a life free from the horrors of homelessness.
The resulting mission statement should look something like this:
Homeless teens. Not a problem here? Better look again. Come join us and
help us get these kids back home to their beds, their rooms, and their fami-
lies. And for those kids who don’t have a home to go back to, you can pro-
vide a means for them to complete their educations and pick up the tools
they need to enter the workforce, which gives them a real chance to succeed
in an adult world.
If you already have a published mission statement for your organization, use
it. You may want to tweak it a bit to fit the case statement format, if you like,
but remember that ultimately the board will have to support it, too.
Rewriting and refreshing
What is your mission? Can you summarize it in seven words or less? Could
you print it on a T-shirt? A bumper sticker? Your agency letterhead? The mis-
sion statement of the Children’s Defense Fund has several different phrases,
but the one we remember most is “Leave No Child Behind,” which the Fund
has made a registered trademark.
38
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

Thousands of nonprofit organizations are out there today — what’s special
about what you do? If you can’t answer that question for yourself and your
agency, you’re going to have a hard time convincing someone else to join
forces with you and fight for your cause. As the competition for fundraising
dollars becomes fiercer (which it has), the need to determine “What’s special
about us?” grows ever greater.
Is it time to rethink your mission? If your analyses of other nonprofits in your
area show that you’re overlapping services with other agencies, it may be
time for a retooling. That requires a lot of thought, vision, planning, and
debate, but positioning your agency to ride the waves of change and meet the
real needs of your clients ensures the life of your organization and the contin-
ued fulfillment of your mission in the future.
Step 2: The goals: What do 
you want to accomplish?
After you’ve established the “why” of your organization — the mission — you
need to think about the “what.” What are you trying to accomplish? Your non-
profit organization’s response to the need you focused on in the mission
statement makes up the goals you want to achieve. Here are a few examples:
 For an animal shelter, one goal might be to increase public awareness of
the importance of spaying and neutering pets, so fewer stray animals
live on the street.
 For a medical research think tank, a goal might be to create a forum for
top-level scientists to discuss the latest advances in cancer research.
 For an arts organization, a goal might be to preserve and promote clas-
sic and contemporary art through interactive exhibits in public schools.
The goals for the StreetReach organization for which the mission statement
was composed (see Step 1, in the preceding section) are these:
 To get teens off the street
 To help teens get home whenever possible
 To enable teens who can’t return home to become self-sufficient
Remember to think “organizational” goals here. You may want to open the
new family center by fall of 2010, but if that’s still in debate, you can’t include
it. Better uses of goals are the bigger challenges you seek to address through
your agency, such as helping to preserve the natural waterways in your area,
improving the reading skills of recovering addicts, or taking arts education
into private schools by the year 2010.
39
Chapter 3: Making Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be

Step 3: The objectives: How 
will you reach your goals?
While your goal may be to get homeless teens off the street, your objective
might be to work with local agencies to find housing for 25 teens a year.
Objectives give you a way to tell the people who read your case statement
how you will accomplish the goals you defined in the last section.
Make your objectives specific, measurable, and attainable.
Here are a few examples of objectives:
 For a community college with a goal to increase enrollment, one objec-
tive might be to enroll 100 new students for the fall semester of 2007.
 For a farming cooperative with a goal to provide low-cost organically
grown produce to the community, one objective could be to organize an
annual fundraising dinner.
 For an Internet research organization that seeks to provide a forum for
debate on Internet thought, one objective might be to host a symposium
on free speech on the Internet in the fall of 2007.
 For a child-advocacy organization with a goal to improve the educational
environment for young children, an objective might be to ensure that
each preschooler has a healthy breakfast.
40
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Similar but not the same
When you first begin working with the mission
statement, goals, and the objectives, the differ-
ent areas may seem to mush together in your
mind. Don’t panic — that’s normal. There is an
important, albeit subtle, difference in each of
these very important areas:
 The mission statement explains the need
that your organization addresses.
 The goals are general ways in which your
organization seeks to respond to that need.
 The objectives list the specific, measurable
ways your organization will meet its goals.
And although not a defined section in your case
statement, your organization’s accountability
needs to come through loud and clear through-
out the entire document. Your donors and other
major stakeholders will get a sense of your
accountability, especially in the sections about
the leadership of your organization, evidence of
financial responsibility, and long-range planning.
Although your organization will have only one
mission statement and a few goals, you may
have several objectives for each of your goals.

The objectives Jane comes up with for StreetReach (the example organization
from Steps 1 and 2, in the preceding sections) show specifically how the orga-
nization plans to work toward each of its goals.
Goal 1 is to get teens off the street, so the objectives are as follows:
 Research and report on the extent of the homelessness problem among
teens by June 1, 2007.
 Develop a trained volunteer group of 30 adults to begin outreach serv-
ices by September 1, 2007.
 Provide, as of September 1, 2007, transitional housing, food, and clothing
to ten teens coming in off the street.
Goal 2 is to help teens get home whenever possible, so the objectives are
 Establish links with national agencies for runaway and homeless teens
by June 30, 2007.
 Establish a fund to provide transportation home for teens by June 30, 2007.
 Identify and contact programs in family mediation in Baltimore and sur-
rounding areas by July 30, 2007.
 Publish materials for teens and parents on healing relationships by 
July 30, 2007.
 Hire two counselors to provide counseling services for teens by
September 1, 2007.
Goal 3 is to enable teens who can’t return home to become self-sufficient, so
the objectives are
 Offer six-month residency program for teens who can’t return home
beginning October 1, 2006.
 Provide occupational evaluations for teens by October 1, 2006.
 Tutor teens (through use of volunteer time and talent) in areas of need
by October 1, 2006.
 Establish links with occupational counselors to place teens in part-time
employment while they complete the residency program by September
1, 2006.
Here are some questions you should be able to answer “yes” to as you write
your objectives:
 Are your objectives brief?
 Are your objectives measurable?
41
Chapter 3: Making Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be

 Did you set a date by which the objectives will be achieved?
 Do the objectives answer the question “How will we meet this spe-
cific goal?”
 Have you included specific program information?
If your organization is using an existing case statement, find out when the
objectives were last updated. Because objectives are measurable and tied 
to programmatic responses to your organization’s goals, they will — and
should — be revised every year.
Step 4: Programs: What, 
exactly, do you provide?
Ah! After completing Step 3, you’ve made it through the rough part — it’s all
downhill from here. In the remaining sections of your case statement, you get
to pull from existing facts instead of focusing on the philosophical whys and
wherefores behind your mission.
In the Programs section, you get to pull out the stops a bit and toot the horn
of your organization. What are your most effective programs? What are you
most proud of? This section enables you to talk about what your organization
does and how it helps the people it serves.
In Jane’s case, she writes about the TLC Program that StreetReach currently
offers, taking medical supplies and basic food and clothing items to kids
living on the street. The major parts of her program, which include links to
area agencies, reuniting teens with families, and residential training for kids
who can’t return home, are all programs StreetReach plans to launch this
year to further their mission.
Be sure to include a paragraph about each of the programs your organization
offers. Then, when you need to use selected paragraphs in a grant proposal
(grant proposals are discussed in Chapter 11), for example, you can simply
remove the paragraphs that don’t apply and leave those that do. See? A mini-
mum effort and economy of work. The case statement helps you write it once —
powerfully, and say it infinitum.
Step 5: Governance: What is 
the anatomy of your board?
Not all prospective donors are board-savvy, but you can be sure that any
donor considering giving you a large gift, or any foundation reviewing your
42
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

grant proposal, will want to know how your organization is governed. Who
comprises your board? What different areas and interests do they represent?
Be sure to include the following things in your Governance section:
 The legal status of your organization. Do you have 501(c)(3) status?
 An overall picture of your board, including number of members, how
members are selected, terms of service, and committee structure
 Specific information about key people on your board
 Information about the administrator, or executive director, of your 
organization
What is a board supposed to do? You may be surprised to see how different
one board is from the next — a variety of personalities and methodologies
comprise the bigger picture of the nonprofit board. Painting with broad
strokes, however, the board makes sure that the organization keeps on track
with its philosophical, legal, and financial goals, but for the most part leaves
the day-in, day-out running of programs and services to staff members. We
talk more about boards in Chapter 4.
Step 6: Staff: Who are the people 
behind your services?
The next important step is to include information on who actually provides the
services to the people you serve. In this section of the case statement, include
both general information about how your staffing system is set up and specific
information on the duties of key roles. You may want to include summarized
job descriptions to give readers an idea of which tasks go with which roles.
In addition to the general talk about the hats your staff members wear, you
need to talk about the staff members themselves. It’s a good idea here to
stick to the key staff members in your organization — people in roles unlikely
to change often, such as the executive director, the director of development,
and so on. Also introduce key volunteers and people who have been ready,
willing, and able to take on leadership for your organization’s cause.
Staff will be an important section in all grant proposals you submit. Along
with those proposals, you will want to attach the resumes of key people in
your programs. As you create your case statement, you may want to request
copies of those resumes so you have them on hand later.
If you are a startup NPO, you may not have staff yet. That’s okay. In your
staffing section, mention that you’re a startup organization, describe any cur-
rent staffing conditions, and mention where you envision your staffing to be a
year from now.
43
Chapter 3: Making Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be

Step 7: Location: Where 
do you live and work?
The Location section describes where you provide the services you offer. You
may have a traditional office in a traditional part of town, or you may be an
Internet-based 501(c)(3) that does its work in the home offices and comput-
ers of various board and staff members. You may work out of a museum or
out of a delivery van. Whatever your location, describe it. Explain how the
location is right for the services you provide. Show how it helps you meet
your goals. And include any plans for improvement and/or enhancement you
have for the facility (and be sure to illustrate how that will speed you on your
way to meeting your service goals).
In the Location section, include
 Your address and information about your neighborhood as it relates to
your mission
 Specific information about the location’s unique applicability to your
function (for example, StreetReach is currently operating in offices at a
Community Development Center, which give them access to office sup-
port services and a connection with a local job training professional on
staff there)
 The number of people who can be served at your location
 Plans for improvement and/or expansion
Step 8: Finances: Is your organization
financially responsible?
Are you a numbers person? If not, don’t hesitate to ask someone who is to
help you with this section. The way in which you communicate the finances
of your organization has much to do with the credibility your potential donor
perceives.
Summarizing your financial picture
Although the Finance section includes your current financial statements, one
of the most important things a donor looks for is an explanation — a sum-
mary — of your financial picture.
44
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

Your summary should include
 The way in which your organization now receives income
 The expenses you have
 Your current financial picture
 Your projected financial picture
The most important thing to remember about your Finance section is to write
it in understandable terms. Not everybody is an accountant, but everybody
knows that 1+1=2.
Where do you get your funds? You may sell tickets, get project grants, have
special events, sell memberships, and charge for services. Where do your
funds go? Your expenses may include your staff salaries, your location costs,
costs of current programs, expenses for special projects, and more.
Getting tips for writing the Finance section
Talking about money is a tough thing to do, and writing about it can be worse.
If you remember that you are still simply telling the story — explaining the
need, but this time with numbers — you can get beyond financial phobias and
get the important information down on paper. In general, remember to
 Fight the desire to detail to death. Especially when talking about
money, people tend to show specifics to the nth degree. It’s more impor-
tant in this financial narrative to give the reader a big picture of your
finances. The financial statements you provide can fill in the detail for
those who want them.
 Remember, it’s all about people, not numbers. Numbers and people
aren’t mutually exclusive — talk about your numbers in the context of
the people they help. For example, use a statement like, “We were able
to feed 250 preschool children breakfast on 180 school days at an aver-
age cost of 56 cents per child.”
 Show and tell. Charts are helpful in giving readers a quick impression of
your overall financial picture. Create charts that are easy to understand,
and be sure to title and label them in such a way that readers can get the
message quickly.
 Evaluate and revise. Your board will be reviewing your entire case state-
ment, of course, but you may want to have your financial advisor review
the finances section before the initial review. Having a professional take
a peek at the numeric data can help you catch any errors or inconsisten-
cies early.
45
Chapter 3: Making Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be

Step 9: Development: What 
will you do in the future?
What are you doing to ensure your organization’s future? Do you have a
development plan in place? What does the five-year plan for your agency look
like? How does your organization evaluate itself? How do you know when
you’ve met your goals?
Anyone thinking of contributing to your cause wants to know that you will be
around tomorrow. If they donate $1,000 to your symphony today, they want
to know that they will be able to come hear Mozart in the summer series. The
development plan you describe in this section shows your prospective donor
the following things:
 That your organization has a vision for the future
 That you have a specific plan for carrying out that vision
 That you have checks and balances in place to ensure accountability
 That you have credible people monitoring programs, finances, and growth
 That you have a means of evaluating your own progress and revising
goals as needed
This section requires big-time board input. If you’re the lone development
person or a volunteer putting together a case statement for the first time, you
may not know how these things work in your particular agency. Not all orga-
nizations have a system of self-evaluation, although everyone seems to agree
it’s a much-needed facet of nonprofit management. If you’re in the dark about
these things, request a meeting with your executive director and/or board
chairperson. Asking and answering questions about the way your programs
get evaluated may just start a domino effect that causes your board to think
about these things seriously for the first time.
Step 10: History: What successes 
are you building on?
Many charitable organizations — especially those that have been around for a
long time — want to tell you their history. They’ll keep you rooted in your seat
for hours, describing great people, events, and influences that came about
because of their existence in your community. They’ll be glad to show you
photos of past volunteers and produce a timeline of significant achievements.
There’s only one thing wrong with this approach — it puts your donors to
sleep.
46
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

Today’s donors want to know the highlights that show you have momentum
and accomplishments to build on, but their focus is all about today’s issues.
History is all well and good and is important as a means for gauging how your
organization has lived up to its promises in the past, but people giving money
today want to know where the money will go today. They want to join with you
in solving a need today. And they’re also interested in doing something today
that will help make things better for tomorrow. For this reason, the History sec-
tion comes at the end of the case statement, not that it’s unimportant.
There’s power in history — a reconnecting energy that summons the best of
the past with the hope for tomorrow. Your past successes are essential in
convincing donors that their money will actually accomplish something. The
people involved with your organization catch the spark first ignited by your
agency’s founders when they relive the history of the need, the mission, and
the people. But the viability of your current request doesn’t lie in its past.
You’re raising money today because there’s a need for what you do — today.
Speak to that need. Put real faces on the need, describing people whose lives
improve because of your mission.
Polishing Your Case Statement
It’s time to sit down and write that case statement. This part is pretty much
like any writing process: You have to craft a well-written draft, evaluate it
objectively to make it tighter and stronger, and then run it up the flagpole
and see who salutes. Then you go back and tighten it some more.
Each of these steps makes for a more powerful and direct written tool for your
agency and takes the load off of you so you don’t have to write in a vacuum.
Discovering ten tips for writing 
a great case statement
After you have the framework for what goes in to your case statement, you
need to polish it up and make it readable. Here are some tips that should help:
 Make it clear. Focus your mission statement, goals, objectives, and pro-
gram information so readers get a well-defined picture of what you’re
saying.
 Make it urgent. With so many causes competing today, you need to give
your reader a reason to care about your cause now. What’s urgent about
the problem your agency seeks to solve? Be sure that the reader knows
why today is the time to act.
47
Chapter 3: Making Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be

 Make it complete. Remember the five Ws for news stories — who, what,
when, where, and why — and include them in your case statement. Be
sure to include these facts in the Executive Summary, as well. That sec-
tion may be the only part decision makers read, and the answers to
those questions are the ones they will want to know first.
 Make it interesting. Tell stories when you can — both success stories
and heart-tugging stories capture the emotions of your reader. Hearing
about how parents used your counseling services to help their teenage
daughter recover from a suicide attempt is much more effective than
listing teen suicide statistics.
 Paint images in your readers’ minds. Remember that visual words and
action words activate your reader’s imagination. Did your client smile
when she received her graduation certificate? Say so — paint the smile
in your readers’ minds.
 Don’t overdo it. Tugging on heartstrings requires an even hand. Don’t
gush or overstate. People can only hear so much about Trina’s lost
limbs and then they start to turn away. Explain, describe, but don’t go
overboard on the heart-wrenching stories.
 Do your homework. Make sure that the facts of your statement — 
financials, program design, staff info, and plans — are accurate and well
researched. Have a complete set of case information for board members
to review well in advance of the next meeting. That way, people can
come to the meeting with a complete set of data, some opinion about
what they’ve read (don’t expect a standing ovation the first time out),
and a few suggestions of their own. If you have all the facts in place,
others can concentrate on helping you shape what you started with.
 Summarize. Using understandable language is an important part of an
effective case statement. Don’t let your budget speak for itself — it won’t!
Write a budget narrative, to explain in real-world terms what your num-
bers mean. Don’t hesitate to summarize and clarify when some good old-
fashioned straight talk will erase a few question marks in the reader’s mind.
 Include a call to action. After you get your readers all worked up about
your programs and your agency, don’t just leave them sitting there —
give them a way to help. Your case statement should include ways the
reader can join with your cause. Make sure that you talk about how much
that new program costs, what you need in the way of hardware to start it,
what talents you’d welcome, and more. Invite people to participate.
 Reread, revisit, revise. This case statement business isn’t a walk in the
park. Even if you’ve been writing for a while and you’re fairly confident
in your communication skills, you’ll find that writing a good case state-
ment takes an open mind, a willing heart, and a very small ego. It’s meant
to be a team effort — something that is forged only after considerable
48
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

conversation and, sometimes, debate. So draft your best shot, take two
aspirin, and ask for reviews — from past donors, from volunteers, staff,
and the board — and await the next meeting when everyone gets a turn
at being Editor (the one with the Big Red Pen). Don’t take corrections
and changes personally, either — remember that the ultimate goal is a
sterling, clever, but most of all heart-felt and engaging case statement
that will represent the passion and purpose of your organization.
Evaluating your case statement
After you’ve finished the draft of your case statement, put it in a drawer for a
day or two (if you have the luxury of time) and then reread it with fresh eyes.
When you do, read it with the following ideas in mind:
 Is the need compelling?
 Are your goals communicated clearly?
 Do your objectives seem realistic?
 Are your programs described fully?
 Does your board appear competent and ready for growth?
 Is your staff well equipped and capable?
 Does your location provide what you need to carry out your services?
 Is your financial section complete and written in understandable terms?
 Does your board have a method of evaluating itself and the organiza-
tion’s progress?
 Does your History section tell the lively story of your organization?
49
Chapter 3: Making Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be
Who’s at stake?
A stakeholder is someone who has an interest
in your organization — whether that person 
is a donor, a volunteer, a staff member, or a
board member. When you begin to discuss case
statements, it’s a good idea to test the primary
ideas — such as your mission statement —
with a sampling of your stakeholders. Be sure
to have clients represented as well as those
people who serve them. One arts organization
created to support a local symphony forgot to
count the musicians among the stakeholders
from whom they invited input. Oops. Be sure
that when you ask for opinions and suggestions,
you ask a wide range of people who care about
what you do — not only those responsible for
securing the funding for it.

If you have all the basic questions answered, you can take one more look at
the case statement before you release it for your board’s review. This time,
focus on the language used:
 Try to paint pictures in your reader’s mind. Images last longer than
abstracts. Describe the light in the eyes of the elderly patient, not just
the medical supplies she receives.
 Write with passion. Your words will read with passion. “The masterful
chords of Rachmaninoff sounded through Sandinsky Hall, pounding power-
fully from the fingers of 14-year-old piano prodigy Anna LaFuentes . . .”
 Use “alive” language. The verbs you choose carry the movement of the
images. Flash strong words wherever possible. “The Clean Needles pro-
gram brings healing to an ailing neighborhood in downtown Detroit . . .”
 Keep people in front. Your case statement is, on one level, the story of
your organization; but your organization is the story of people in need
and your response to that need: “Where did you first learn to read? In a
big overstuffed armchair in your family’s living room? In your grand-
mother’s lap? Sitting, well fed and warm, in your first grade classroom?
Or did you learn the way 12-year-old Eric did, cold, unfed, and dirty,
trying to teach himself to read while crouching under a bridge to stay
dry on a blustery fall day . . .”
Finally, when the case statement is drafted and it’s as good as it’s going to
get, print it and deliver it to your board for review. When you get the docu-
ment back, don’t be disheartened to see red marks all over it — the case
statement is organic, the growing vision of an organization that evolves and
changes.
This would be a great time for a board retreat, which we discuss in Chapter 4.
Think of it: Your board schedules a weekend away, at a retreat center in the
foothills. The leaves are beginning to change — the crisp promise of fall is in
the air. Board members review the case statement, debate points, focus their
vision, and come back with the completed case — and renewed vigor — to
apply to the future of the organization.
Testing your ideas
The case statement gives you a creative way to (1) think through your ideas;
(2) get them down on paper; and (3) test them with the people who care
about your organization. Testing your case periodically is a good idea, even
50
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

after you’ve written a sterling case statement you plan to use to infinity.
Reviewing and testing your case helps you determine the following things:
 Is the case still pertinent for your organization?
 Is the need still real?
 Are your solutions timely and effective?
 Are you well staffed?
 What does your board involvement look like?
 How sound are your programs?
 Have others given to your cause?
 Have any prominent members of the community given?
 Are your long-range plans still on target with your goals?
One great way to test your ideas for your case is to bring in a group of people
for a focus group. A focus group is any group of people you bring together to
focus on a particular task, document, problem, or program. Focus groups are
often used to test a new idea with a sampling of people and can be very valu-
able in gauging things that are best not left solely to the “inside” perspective
of those who work with your organization on a day-in, day-out basis.
You may want to set up a focus group early in the case statement process, as
you’re assembling information. You can set the rules for your focus group,
but in general follow these guidelines:
 Have something to show the group, such as a draft of your case state-
ment or an outline so they have something to respond to.
 Give simple instructions about what types of evaluations you are look-
ing for.
 Review the case and ask for questions before you turn the group loose
to discuss their ideas.
 If you have a large group, let the group divide into teams of three or four.
 Have each group select a representative who will write down the ideas.
 Leave plenty of time for group discussion when the smaller groups
reconvene.
 Thank the participants (and send follow-up thank-you cards).
51
Chapter 3: Making Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be

Although focus groups can be helpful in getting a feel for issues you need to
address in more depth, don’t mistake them for a representative sampling of
public opinion. If four out of six people in the group think that your idea is a
great one, for example, you can’t take that to mean that the same percentage
of the general public will feel the same way. Test your ideas, throw them out
in a focus group, and listen carefully to the ideas and suggestions offered.
Then you can use the preliminary information you’ve gathered to target and
launch a more in-depth investigation, if needed.
Although you may find it easier for someone from your organization to con-
duct the focus group, having an independent third party facilitate the focus
group, especially someone who has experience doing so, can be useful.
Individuals deeply involved with your organization may not as easily pick up
on nuances as a properly briefed third party. You don’t necessarily have to
pay a third-party facilitator — friends or acquaintances can often play this
role for free because they care about you or your organization.
Remember that inviting people to help is a great way to help them feel
included, valued, and worthwhile. Choose a cross section of your favorite
donors, people who have invested time, money, and care in your organization
and your cause.
Don’t ask other people’s opinions unless you’re willing to accept their input
graciously and make use of it.
52
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Building on a legacy
Maybe you’ll be lucky and you won’t have to
write a case from the ground up. You may
already have the information you need printed
in other places, in other forms. Be sure to do
some sleuthing before you begin writing things
from scratch. You might look for already-pub-
lished information in your organization:
 History booklet
 Information brochure
 Annual report
 Membership brochure
 Program overviews
 Past grant proposals
Of course, after you find the information you
seek, you still need to make sure that the infor-
mation is up-to-date and reflects the needs of
your organization today. The same testing
ground should still be in place so that you can
show the case statement to trustees, donors,
selected clients, and trusted volunteers.

Printing and putting the final 
case statement to work
After your case statement is final, edited, revised, and approved, what do you
do with it? Print it up in a professional format. Here are some ideas for creat-
ing a nice-looking but low-key case statement:
 Use a readable typeface. Remember that the people reading your case
may be young, old, or anywhere in between; so don’t make the print
(also referred to as a font) too small. Generally setting your word
processor to 12-point Times Roman is a good choice.
 Make your headlines stand out — but not too far out. You will have
headings for each of the major categories, and you need to choose a
type size and style that lets readers know that you’re changing tracks. A
larger font, like Arial 16 bold, accomplishes this. Consider using built-in
styles for consistency.
 Avoid using too many type differences. The flexibility of word process-
ing gives you so many different typefaces and formatting choices to play
with that you can drive yourself — and your readers — batty by using
too many bells and whistles in a single document.
 Include charts if necessary. Charts are a great way to show complex
information at a glance, but don’t include them if you don’t need them.
Including visual effects gratuitously may seem like a good idea in the
name of holding people’s attention, but unneeded information in a case
is just a waste of everyone’s time.
Finally, after you have the case statement in its final form, you can reuse what
you’ve created in a number of different publications. This isn’t only a smart use
of your time; it also helps build the credibility of your organization because all
your publications are consistent. You can use the information you created in
your case statement in virtually everything you publish about your organiza-
tion, including brochures, newsletters, grant proposals, campaign plans, appeal
letters, speeches, press releases, and on your Web site.
Always keep a master copy of your case statement updated with changes,
revisions, and ideas that others suggest. You may find that as the years go by,
some ideas work better than others, some programs are explained better
than others, and some foundations request more information in certain areas
because your case isn’t quite detailed enough on some points. You can make
those over time, improving the case as you go along. Your case statement,
like your organization, is an evolving, growing entity. Remember to keep it 
up-to-date as your agency goes through its life cycle.

I
n this chapter, we show you how to work with two of your most valuable
assets: your board and your volunteers. Your board helps you set your
goals and strategies. They can provide tremendous support for fundraising
efforts. Volunteers are the people in the trenches who lick stamps, go door-
to-door, or process donations. These two groups of people provide the
answers to the why and how of any fundraising effort.
Starting with a Good Board
Start by asking yourself a few questions:
 What do you do when the board looks to you for answers?
 How are boards put together?

 What are their responsibilities?
 How can you ensure that prospective board members come on board in
a role that’s right for them?
The board is a very important part of your organization, so you will need to
understand who these people are and what they can do for you. Recruiting
the best members for your board is one of the most important steps in start-
ing to fundraise.
As a development person, you may wonder what your role with the board
should be. If you are the development director or executive director, of
course, the board hired you. If you are a volunteer, you may have grown
through the ranks into a position of volunteer leadership, which means that
you have some involvement with your board.
As the person in a key fundraising position, you may want to know some of
these basics about your role in relation to the board:
 Share the fundraising. You are not — nor should you be — the Lone
Fundraiser for your organization. The board is responsible for oversee-
ing the mission, development, implementation, and evaluation of the
work that’s carried out. Each person involved in the leadership of the
organization should be willing to be involved in securing the funds nec-
essary to fulfill the mission. If fundraising is not part of your board mem-
bers’ job descriptions, it should be.
 Identify prospective board members. Even if your role doesn’t include
recruiting board members (in some organizations, recruitment is done
on a peer-to-peer basis), your role is key in identifying people who
would add experience and assets to your board.
 Keep the spark alive. Part of your role as a development person is to
help your board catch the spark if they’ve lost it (see Chapter 1 to read
about the spark); you can do this by providing information, running
retreats, or suggesting new roles and committee structures.
 Train and educate new members. Another part of your work with the
board involves training new members and educating them about
fundraising opportunities, keeping abreast of new ideas and avenues,
and apprising the board of needs, changes, and the status of current
campaigns.
As a development person, you may find a big difference in your relationship
with the board in small, medium, and large nonprofits. In a small agency, you
may have a close, team-like relationship with the entire board. In a larger
organization, you may work only with the development committee, and even
that relationship may have a formal feeling to it.

Understanding Board Dynamics: 
Wimps Need Not Apply
Being a board member isn’t all about prestige and power. It involves vision,
dedication, hard work, and all the responsibility a person is willing and able
to handle. Some of the most important duties of a board include recruiting
and hiring the CEO; approving the mission statement, the budget, and the
fundraising plan; and developing the policies that make the staff accountable
to the organization. This section explains the various responsibilities of the
board, which can be divided into three major areas (see Figure 4-1):

Making sure that you’re legal
The board of directors for your organization has the responsibility of govern-
ing the agency, both in terms of legal issues and in answering the question,
“Are we being true to our mission?” Board members are charged with the
stewardship of the organization’s assets — financial and material — holding
these items in trust for the stakeholders. Some of the legal responsibilities of
the board include the following:
 Making sure that the organization qualifies and applies for 501(c)(3) status
 Incorporating the organization as a nonprofit corporation
 Drafting and adopting the corporate charter
 Drafting the organization’s bylaws
 Ensuring that the organization operates within its legal requirements
 Overseeing and ensuring the payment of financial responsibilities
 Determining that actions of the agency fit the organization’s mission
If you’re with a new organization preparing to draft its charter and bylaws,
you may want to talk to some of the attorneys in your area. Lawyers often
take pride in doing pro bono (free or at-cost) work for nonprofits.
Assessing what the community 
thinks of your organization
There was a time when a family’s honor was tied to the family name. A
member of the family was thought to represent the entire family in public, in
business, in life. Honor was at stake. Reputation was important.
Your organization’s reputation is also important. One of the roles that your
board plays is representing your organization. Your board members are your
organization to the community. The choices the board makes — on behalf of
the organization or not — reflect on you and your mission. As a group, they are
responsible for evaluating and leading the public persona of your organization.
Everyone wants their boards staffed with high-profile members — the people
who are asked to serve on everything, the people who have power, money,
and friends they can bring to your donor base. As important as these very
real assets are, however, is the credibility a respected member of your com-
munity brings to your organization. When others see that a known and
respected person aligns with your mission, they begin to see your organiza-
tion in a different light.
58
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

There’s a dual side to this community liaison role: the way in which your
board represents the community to your organization. Your board may be
comprised of folks who represent all sorts of different interests in the com-
munity you serve — you may have people who benefit from the services you
offer as well as service providers, lawyers, bankers, educators, policy
makers, business leaders, and more. They help make sure that your organiza-
tion meets the needs of the community it serves.
In the old days, the message given to boards was “your main responsibility is
to hire and fire the Chief Executive.” Now boards have a responsibility to
serve their stakeholders as well. And along with the responsibility to stake-
holders may come a personal or legal responsibility. Case in point: An arts
organization in Chicago recently sued a board member who pledged a major
gift and then refused to carry through with the pledge. The moral? Think
carefully about what you expect from your board members and be sure that
everyone understands these expectations.
Running an effective board meeting
Who runs the board meeting? The staff does. If you’re the paid staff, you
create and circulate the agenda, you keep the meeting running, and you come
up with creative ideas to keep the board sparked and moving forward. Even if
59
Chapter 4: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers
NPOs are tarred and feathered 
with the same brush
Your board is ultimately responsible for moral
and ethical issues as far are your nonprofit is
concerned. When the board abdicates its
responsibility to monitor what’s going on in the
organization, disaster can strike and the recov-
ery can be slow and painful.
A now legendary fall from grace in the nonprofit
community happened almost 15 years ago at
the United Way. The CEO at that time had served
a number of good years with the agency when
he lost sight of his mission and began making
unethical and unwise choices. When the 
fiscal abuses came to light, the whole of the
United Way — and, in fact, the entire nonprofit
community — was tarnished. Donors wondered
whether their money was going to fund flights
to Europe or hidden agendas.
After an extensive evaluation of the situation, it
was discovered that the board, which had
appeared to be the best possible board an orga-
nization could have, dropped the ball in this sit-
uation. No one knew what was going on. No
questions had been asked. They had abdicated
their role as guardians of the ethical standards
for the organization, and in doing so had
enabled a situation that had a negative impact
on public perception.

another worker in the organization runs the general meeting, when it’s time
for the fundraising discussion, you’re probably up to bat.
Here are ways to get your board meetings off snooze control and wake them
up to a new level of productivity:
 Set your agenda. Nobody wants to sit through a board meeting that
drones on for hours covering lots of territory that could more effectively
be dealt with in committee. Better to be focused, goal oriented, and
achieving instead of wheel-spinning, confused, and ineffective. Set your
agenda, circulate it before the meeting, and come equipped with ideas to
keep the discussion moving forward when it begins to stall, or reel it in
when it begins to spin off course.
 Be creative. Talking isn’t your only means of communication in a meet-
ing. You can do a conference call with a member of your national office;
you can show a video on board fundraising; or have guest speakers, con-
sultants, or clients who receive your services come in and speak to the
board. If they can’t come in, use online videoconferencing software to
pull them into the meeting.
 Bring in the other guys. What’s wrong with bringing in the CEO of a
competing nonprofit and having him share his ideas with your board?
People do it all the time. And often, in the nonprofit community, those
achieving are willing to share their ideas. The chairman of the art
museum board comes in to speak to the symphony board. The person in
charge of the biggest homeless shelter in town goes to talk to the newest
shelter. When you invite someone with a fresh perspective to your meet-
ings, your board members begin to ask themselves, “Why haven’t we
tried that?” or “Is that something we should think about doing next year
when we launch our capital campaign?”
 Ask tough questions. The best CEOs are willing to hear bad news. What
isn’t working? Where do your services fall down? What’s being done to
improve them? Opening up to hearing not only the good reports but also
the bad ones presents some interesting — and perhaps lively — debate.
 Build in time to brainstorm. So many board meetings get mired down in
the mundane. Don’t just have monotonous business talk — build in
brainstorming time. You can reserve 15 minutes as a matter of course to
brainstorm on one area of your organization that needs attention.
Choose the brainstorming topic when you send around the agendas. A
successful brainstorming session leaves your board members thinking,
and gives them inspiration to carry through to their next tasks.
Advancing your cause by using your board
Is your organization on track to realize its vision? It’s up to your board to over-
see all strategic planning: setting goals, drafting objectives, and developing
60
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

action items that move your organization in the direction it wants to go. Here
is what the board is expected to do for your organization to keep it on track:
 Hiring, evaluating, and maybe firing an executive director: A major
part of making sure that the organization is headed in the right direction
is the selection, recruitment, and hiring of the executive director. Of
course, the board’s responsibility also includes the evaluation and, occa-
sionally, the dismissal of the executive director.
When the board evaluates the executive director, whose input should it
invite? A recent online discussion in a nonprofit group batted around the
pros and cons of involving staff in executive director evaluations. Some
members felt that it was most effective to have peer reviews for execu-
tive directors as well as reviews from the executive director’s immediate
reports. Others weren’t so sure. One worry is that someone with an ax
to grind may take a swing at the executive director. The consensus
among industry professionals was to welcome input from key staff mem-
bers but remind the board to use its discernment in determining issues
and courses of action.
 Setting up systems of accountability: The board is responsible for set-
ting up systems to test the credibility and accountability of the organiza-
tion. This involves financial audits and on-site visits. It’s not enough to
count on the assurances of the executive director — board members
need periodically to see with their own eyes what’s going on at the loca-
tions where services are provided.
 Raising funds for the organization: Boards are integrally involved in
raising funds for the organization. They are charged with making sure
that the resources are there for the mission to be carried out. This
includes all sorts of tasks related to the acquisition, management, and
spending of funds.
 Making individual contributions: An important aspect of board leader-
ship involves board members making their own donations. Some mem-
bers feel that the donation of their time and effort should count as their
“donation.” But many foundations, as well as high-level donors, want to
see, before they give, that you have “100 percent participation” of your
board. That means that all your board members contribute financially to
your organization.
 Approving the fundraising plan: The board is also vitally important in
approving the fundraising plan for the organization. You may draft it, but
the board okays it and holds you to your milestones, too. (See Chapter 5
for more on developing your fundraising plan.)
61
Chapter 4: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers

Recruiting Board Members
What people make the best board members? First and foremost, they’re
people who care. A board member who has been affected by the illness your
nonprofit fights or touched by the services you offer makes a great ally.
Hopefully, your board also comprises people who bring the richness of expe-
rience, the expertise of their professions, and financial, social, and strategic
resources to the organization, the board at large, and the individuals served
by the organization.
Profiling the ideal board member:
Diversity counts
Although you do hear a lot about board members’ financial resources in any
given discussion on boards and fundraising, note that board service isn’t only for
the wealthy. Some board members are selected, at least in part, because they
can give the organization access to donors in a certain income bracket. But this,
also, is not true of the entire board. A healthy board needs to be diverse and
should include some people who receive the services your organization offers.
Are all board members volunteers? Most, but not all, nonprofit boards are
staffed by volunteer board members. In a few high-profile organizations, how-
ever, board members are paid for their services.
Wouldn’t it be nice if, when you need a new board member, you could just
stop into Board Members “R” Us and pick one out? Unfortunately, it’s not that
simple. Here are a few ideas on where to start looking:
 Businesses who serve the same clients you reach out to. Make alliances
with these companies.
 Stakeholders in the organization itself. Look at clients who have received
services or family members of clients
 Board members in other NPOs in your city. Get a list of 501(c)(3)s and
look for those people who may have an affinity for your organization’s
mission.
 Annual reports from organizations with complementary missions. For
example, if you know that Mrs. Goldenrod is a benefactor of a local art
gallery, she is a logical match for your Community Arts Council agency.
Great board members come from all walks of life. The best board members
have passion for your organization, the expertise or insight that is needed on
your board, some experience in fundraising, and the willingness to commit
their time and to work hard. Over 90 percent of all symphony board members
have played an instrument. It all comes back to passion.

Picking the perfect-size board
So just how big should a board be? The answer depends on the size of the
organization. A small nonprofit may have few members — maybe 8 to 12. A
large organization may have 75 active board members, but that group is
divided into a number of committees charged with handling different respon-
sibilities in the organization. In a large board, the primary committee is called
the Executive Committee; other committees may include both voting and
nonvoting members.
A board that’s too large can be unwieldy. Simply scheduling a board meeting
with 25 people can be a nightmare for a small group with few, if any, paid
staff. Have enough members to bring the skills and diversity you need, but
not so many that managing the board is a full-time job.
Whether you’re dealing with a large or small board, having a committee
structure enables the board to divide up responsibilities and make more
effective use of its members’ already-limited time. The Executive Committee
may meet, say, quarterly throughout the year, and the other committees,
which are organized to fulfill different parts of the organizational responsibili-
ties, can meet in the interim as needed or as scheduled to accomplish their
specific goals. Table 4-1 lists types of committees that often are part of the
bigger board structure:

Chapter 4: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers

Building a successful board
How can you, as a development person, help make sure that the right people
are in the right roles on your organization’s board? You can keep several
things in mind as you review your board and evaluate the types of roles you
need to fill:
 Note the age of your clients and constituents. Does the average age of
your board members reflect the people you serve? Is the board all of the
same generation or does it represent a mix of ages?
 At least some members should be deeply involved in the mission.
 At least some members should have a business background.
 You should have a written job description for board service as it applies
to your organization.
 You should have a committee structure that gives prospective members
a range of options for involvement.
Setting expectations for 
your board members
When you prepare to talk to a prospective board member about a vacancy on
your board, first get focused on what you are asking for and what you expect
from a board member. The more specific you can be, the better for all involved.
This enables the prospective board member to understand what the role
involves, how much time it requires, what the financial considerations are
(such as how much he is expected to raise and whether he is expected to
give), and how long he’s expected to serve.
When you are recruiting a new board member, you need to communicate,
however diplomatically, that board members are expected to
 Be giving members of the board
 Fundraise
 Attend meetings
 Participate in at least one committee function
Do you have to be wealthy to be a board member? Although it may some-
times appear that board membership is an opportunity for the rich, in reality,
a nonprofit is best served by having all its stakeholders represented in its
board membership. Most boards don’t demand a certain “bottom-line” 
64
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

contribution from board members (although some do); instead, giving to the
organization — based on your ability to do so — is what’s most important.
Later, when you turn in those grant proposal applications, it’s important to
be able to say, “We have a 100-percent giving board.”
In small nonprofits, board members often have to wear many hats. Be sure to
identify the qualities you need — links to major givers, money management
skills, strategic planners — before you begin the process of scouting prospec-
tive board members to fill open seats.
Presenting your case to prospective 
board members
The link between board member and organization is an important one, simi-
lar to that between donor and organization. A donor, after all, needs to catch
the passion and be willing to act. A board member needs not only to catch
the passion and be willing to act, but also to be willing to get things done and
shoulder considerable responsibility over a specified term.
Just as the link between donor and organization should benefit both, the rela-
tionship between board member and organization should be an equitable
one. To get that synergy, you have to find the right fit. People who have the
talent you need and the time to invest make happy, effective board members.
People who feel coerced into taking a role or sign up for the wrong slot may
be less than satisfied with their role and, ultimately, with the organization.
When you talk to a prospective board member about his or her involvement,
be sensitive to the board member’s language — both physical and verbal. Is
she worried about the time investment? Is she horrified by the idea of
fundraising? Is she overcommitted as it is?
By offering board members a range of options, you can give someone the
opportunity to gracefully decline a role that would be too much for him, but
still keep him involved and invested in your cause. For example, one small
nonprofit has a number of different categories for its board:
 Honorary members who have contributed effort or income or both at a
high level and are recognized for their ongoing involvement
 Advisory members who serve to advise the board in specific areas
related to the organization’s mission
 Founding members who function as an advisory council to the executive
board
 Executive members who are the voting members of the board
65
Chapter 4: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers

Spotting the Red Flags
The world of the boardroom in the nonprofit community is diverse. As differ-
ent as the organizations they serve, boards often develop unhealthy prac-
tices. Here are a few bad board symptoms to watch for:
 Members thrive on micromanagement. Your board should not be in the
micromanagement business. Although the board is responsible for
recruiting and hiring the Executive Director; for approving the mission
statement, the budget, and the fundraising activity; and for developing
policies that make the staff accountable to the mission, it should not be
providing services. Board members should not go in and tell the staff
how to do their jobs.
Repeat after us: Policy is the job of the board. Administration is the job
of the staff.
 The executive director is the Big Cheese. Although it’s not unusual to
find an executive director who also serves as board chairperson, in gen-
eral, this is not a great idea. Having your exec on your board could one
day take its toll on the organization’s accountability. If the executive
director isn’t doing his job and he’s also the chairman of the board,
who’s going to call the meeting to fire him?
 Meetings are stuck in the past. If you find yourself spending all your
time in the executive committee meeting rehashing old issues and going
over things already decided, ask yourself why. Are there new plans on
the horizon? Are you moving forward? Be sure to schedule brainstorm-
ing time at the end of your meeting, and give yourself the time you need
to focus on the forward motion of your organization. Brainstorming
gives your board members something to mull over between meetings
and ends the meeting on a progressive and inspiring note.
 Members are no-shows. What kind of board attendance do you have? If
attendance is dwindling consistently, you may have a big problem. Do
board members know what’s expected of them, meeting-wise? Do you
schedule too many meetings? Are your meetings so far apart that mem-
bers forget where they left off? Do you need a better method of notifying
members about upcoming meetings? You can’t have a healthy, active
board unless your board members are willing to spend time and effort.
Keep an eye on attendance and be ready to start tracking it if there
seems to be a problem.
Re-energizing Your Board with a Retreat
If someone walked up to your desk and gave your organization a check for
$2,000 to spend any way you’d like, what would you do with it?
66
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

One organization used a donation to plan a board retreat and came away
thinking that it was the best way they’d ever spent their organization’s money.
One of the problems built into board service specifically and in nonprofit
work in general is that you don’t seem to have any time left over at the end of
the day to do that all-important planning and brainstorming. “We spend so
much time rubber-stamping what we’ve already done,” said one development
director, “that we never think about where we’re going.”
If you haven’t had a board retreat in the last year, you probably need to plan
one. A retreat, whether it lasts a day or a weekend, gives the board and key
staff members time to reflect, get perspective on what they’re doing, and per-
haps turn your organization in a much-needed new direction.
When’s a good time for a board retreat? As with anything that isn’t part of
your day-to-day putting out of fires, it sometimes seems that there’s never a
good time. Still, you may want to schedule a board retreat when you are
 Drafting your case statement
 Identifying your constituents
 Doing strategic planning
 Preparing your annual review
 Launching a new initiative
Try using these tips for your next board retreat:
 Suggest the idea of the retreat to the board weeks before you want to
plan the event. This way they can free up their calendars and prepare
mentally for the meeting.
 Hire an outside person to facilitate the meeting. If you do, you can par-
ticipate in the brainstorming rather than lead the discussion.
Where can you find a good retreat facilitator? You may want to look into
an organization whose mission it is to provide just such support to non-
profits. However, if you want to select an individual, look for someone
with a background in nonprofits, fundraising, or management. Of course,
good interpersonal and communication skills are a must.
What results should you see come from a board retreat? You should see some
specifics, such as objectives, action plans, and assignments. You should also see
renewed vigor and a more unified vision, plus a flare in your collective spark.
You can use a number of analytic models to help you determine what your
organization has to work with and what it needs to work on. SWOT (Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) is one such method of evaluation that
67
Chapter 4: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers

helps you and your board brainstorm about the various assets and liabilities
in your current organization and gives you the information you need to
develop an informed and effective strategic plan. Visit www.quickmba.com/
strategy/swot/ to study the basics of this approach.
Checking Your Perspective on Volunteers
How important are volunteers? Are they just the people with nothing better
to do who donate their time to your organization for free? Do you give them
the jobs the paid staff doesn’t want to do? Do they come and go as they want,
involved or not as the mood strikes them? What, if anything, do volunteers
have to do with the fundraising efforts of your organization?
In school we all feared quizzes. So why as adults do we gravitate to them
when one shows up in a magazine or on a Web site? Who knows! Take the fol-
lowing quiz so you can understand your attitudes toward volunteers as well
as get a take on the proper perspective. (Taking the quiz is voluntary, of
course.)
1. The agency needs volunteers because
A. We can’t afford to pay people for all the work we need done.
B. Volunteers help us extend our effectiveness.
C. Using volunteers is the right thing to do.
D. Having a strong volunteer corps looks good on the grant proposals
that we submit.
E. All of the above.
Although each of these answers may be true to some degree (with the
possible exception of C — utilizing volunteers is “right” for your organi-
zation only if they are needed in order to fulfill your mission), the cor-
rect answer is B, “They help us extend our effectiveness.” Volunteers
aren’t around to do your drudgework or to do the things the paid staff
doesn’t want to do. They fulfill a useful, vital role in your organization,
which can enhance and increase your fundraising effectiveness.
2. Volunteers should be expected to
A. Submit to an interview
B. Go through training
C. Show up as scheduled
D. Communicate with staff if something isn’t working
E. All of the above
68
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

Pretty easy one, eh? It should be. A volunteer should be expected to do
E, “All the above.” Because it’s important that volunteers value what
they contribute, they need to treat a job as a job, paid or not. Having
good, trained, capable volunteers is important for your organization
both in terms of the work that gets done and the way your organization
appears to the outside world. Interviewing, training, and evaluating vol-
unteers are as important as those tasks in the paid world of employment.
3. Volunteers should not be expected to
A. Fundraise
B. Recruit other volunteers
C. Rearrange their schedules
D. Play a leadership role
E. All of the above
The correct answer here is C, “Rearrange their schedules.” When some-
one volunteers time and talent, it’s common courtesy to allow them to
choose their time of service. If you really need someone in a certain time
slot, it’s okay to ask, of course. Your best bet is to give a volunteer a
range of times in which to serve — people honor commitments more
consistently when they’ve had a say in defining them.
At first glance, you may have opted for A, “Fundraise,” but who says that
volunteers shouldn’t fundraise? Your board members do it all the time, and
most (but not all) board members are volunteers. Volunteers can be very
effective as fundraising team members. In fact, at one point in our fundrais-
ing experience, we brought in a team of volunteers to raise $125,000, giving
each of them the responsibility of raising $5,000 through their own dona-
tions, friends, families, and peers. Each volunteer was carefully selected
and trained, and every one met his or her fundraising goal.
Before you approach a volunteer, know what kind of work you want done. Have
a specific plan. Nobody wants to hear, “Oh, we just need warm bodies. We’ll
appreciate any help you can give us.” That sounds as though anybody can do
the job, which isn’t what the volunteer really wants to hear. Volunteers want to
feel that they fill a unique need and that their time and talents are valuable.
4. Happy volunteers are likely to benefit the organization by
A. Giving monetary gifts of increasing amounts
B. Remaining dedicated to the organization over time
C. Attracting friends to the organization
D. Improving the public perception of the organization
E. All of the above
This answer is E, “All of the above.” Does that surprise you? Studies
have shown that volunteers who are happy with an organization want to
69
Chapter 4: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers

get closer — and that means taking on more volunteer work, perhaps
taking a leadership position, and giving donations that are higher than
average. The benefits of a happy volunteer are obvious and many.
Friends who see your happy volunteer wonder what’s going on at your
place that’s so fulfilling. People at fundraising events who encounter
your volunteer are struck by the image he or she presents — “Here’s an
organization that is moving in a positive direction.”
Do your volunteers wear many hats? In a small organization, a single volun-
teer may be worked so hard he burns out in a short amount of time. Watch
out for the 80/20 rule — 80 percent of the work is done by 20 percent of the
people. People carrying the 80 percent can tire quickly, which doesn’t do you
or the volunteer any good.
5. Unhappy volunteers are likely to
A. Come to you and tell you what’s wrong
B. Honor their commitments to your agency
C. Talk about their unhappiness with your organization outside your
organization
D. Work through it on their own
E. All of the above
The correct answer for this one is C, and you need to act to avoid that.
In our experience of both leading corps of volunteers and serving as vol-
unteers ourselves, we have seen few volunteers take the initiative to
approach the leadership when something is going wrong. Most likely
what happens is the volunteer suddenly disappears, won’t answer calls,
doesn’t show up for scheduled times, and avoids organizational func-
tions. And you can bet that the volunteer’s friends are hearing about the
problem, even if you aren’t.
If you suspect a volunteer is unhappy, address the issue. Call him and let him
know that he’s been missed. Give him the opportunity to share his feelings
with you. After you know what the problem is, you have a better chance of
addressing it directly. And, odds are he’s not the only one feeling this way, so
working through the problem with one person lays the groundwork for fixing
the problem entirely.
6. Agencies should recognize volunteer efforts by
A. Saying “thank you”
B. Having volunteer dinners
C. Recognizing efforts with certificates, plaques, and so on
D. Inviting the volunteer to participate at a higher level
E. All of the above
70
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

Yes, it’s another E, “All of the above.” Volunteer recognition is a big part
of any agency with a solid volunteer group — if the company wants to
keep the group solid. As you know (and, we hope, practice), “thank you”
may be the two most important words at your disposal. Say “thank you”
to your clients, to each other, to your funders, and especially to those
people who practice true philanthropy — the volunteers who give volun-
tarily of their time, talent, effort, and resources for the benefit of the
greater good.
Although the absolutely greatest asset to any charitable organization is its
donor base, don’t forget that your volunteers are part of that base. A happy
volunteer not only gives more, but he also talks about your mission to other
people, providing an important link between your organization and friends
you haven’t yet met. Remember: The biggest reason people give to organiza-
tions is because they are asked to give by someone they know.
Seeking Volunteers
Where do you find these wonderful volunteers? This isn’t a small task: Whole
committees exist to build a volunteer base — to build it, lead it, and grow it.
We hope that you’ve already acquired a thriving volunteer group, and you
can start with the list you’ve created and build on it. But if not, here’s how
you can find good volunteers:
 Know what — and who — you need. Identify the areas in which you
want to enlist volunteer help. Have specifics, jobs, times, tasks, and rela-
tionships in mind. The more you plan these areas, the better your
chances of finding — and keeping — just the right volunteers.
71
Chapter 4: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers
Ways to say “thank you!”
You can find many, many ways to recognize a
special volunteer. If you are creative and gen-
uine in giving your thanks, your volunteers are
sure to feel appreciated.
 Say it with a smile and mean it.
 Send a card with a personal note.
 Invite the volunteer to lunch.
 Have a recognition dinner for special 
volunteers.
 Give out certificates of recognition.
 Submit a “thank-you” note to your local
paper.
 Mention the volunteer’s work in your orga-
nization’s newsletter.
 Ask the volunteer to speak to a group of
new volunteers.
 Give a plaque of recognition.
 Dedicate a publication or event to your 
volunteers.
 Throw a volunteer party.

 Plan where you want to look for your volunteers. Where would you
find good volunteers for your particular charitable organization?
Looking in a vet’s office for volunteers for an animal shelter is a logical
match. You may find willing participants for your literacy organization
among schoolteachers or local writers.
 Start with your board. Introduce the idea of building your volunteer
group at a board meeting. Ask board members to suggest people they
know who may be interested in serving on a committee or volunteering
their time.
You may have, as part of your board, a nominating committee that is in
charge of identifying and recruiting volunteer board members. Addition-
ally, depending on the makeup of your particular board and the size of
your organization, you may have a committee that identifies, builds, and
trains your volunteer staff. Make sure that they are in communication. A
volunteer who isn’t willing to take on all the responsibilities of a board
member may be willing to take on a smaller task.
 Review your volunteer list. Take a look at your existing list. Do you see
patterns in the volunteers’ other activities that would provide access to
other volunteers — for example, do some volunteers belong to a garden-
ing club that may be a good place to make a presentation for your orga-
nization? Do some belong to a fraternity? A civic group?
 Target families of volunteers. Often the families of volunteers are a
good place to find not only donors, but also to find volunteers. For
example, volunteerism among teens is growing and presents a great
opportunity for progressive-minded charitable organizations.
According to Giving and Volunteering in the United States, 2001, high-
school volunteering reached its highest level in the past 50 years.
 Consider the people served by your organization. Have you consid-
ered your clients as a possible source of volunteers? If you work for a
small business development center, it would be a logical step for some-
one who has mastered valuable business techniques to be interested in
passing them along. If your immunization program for preschoolers
reaches neighborhood parents, you may find moms and dads who have
benefited from your services to be receptive to helping others.
Using Your Volunteers as Fundraisers
As you become more aware of who your volunteers are and what they’re doing,
you notice that a select group may be of great help to you in fundraising.
Following, we list a few of the ways that a volunteer can get directly involved
in fundraising:
72
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

 Serving on a development committee
 Helping you find sponsors for special events or publications
 Writing, printing, or addressing letters
 Working in a phone campaign
 Serving at a special event
 Being part of a donor visit
 Hosting a donor luncheon
How do you know which of your volunteers would be helpful in your
fundraising efforts?
Look for the following qualities in your ideal fundraising volunteer:
 A contagious passion
 The ability to lead others
 Strong organizational skills
 A friendly, open manner
 The ability to follow through
 A talent for working in a team
Remember that involving your volunteers in fundraising efforts takes train-
ing. You don’t want to send Tammy out into the world to begin cold-calling on
people for donations. You do want to think about Tammy’s talents, identify
where they would be most useful, and then create the plan that would match
her talents with your needs.
So let’s say that you decide that Tammy would be a great phone person in
your annual telethon. Remember that you need to give her plenty of infor-
mation about her role. Specifically, you want to prepare Tammy for the
telethon by
1. Showing her how to use the phones (yes, some people don’t realize
you have to dial 9 to get an outside line).
2. Giving her a script and going through it with her a few times.
3. Giving her an instruction sheet that includes her script, the hours
she’s agreed to volunteer, and points to remember.
4. Remembering to say “thank you” after the telethon.
5. Letting her know how she did and inviting her to be part of next
year’s effort.
73
Chapter 4: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers

You can find more details about training for phone solicitations in Chapter 13.
The point here is the importance of training. Poorly trained volunteers can
sink your campaigns and your organization. Not to mention, your volunteers
may have a frustrating experience and disappear forever.
Fundraising isn’t for everyone. Even if a specific volunteer is a great speaker,
an outgoing person, and a valuable member of the community, if he isn’t com-
fortable asking for money, the donors he approaches won’t be comfortable
either. Part of respecting the volunteer-agency relationship means using the
talents volunteers want to offer, which doesn’t involve coercing people into
roles they don’t want to play.
Making Use of Baby Boomers: 
Retirees as Volunteers
In the next 20 years or so you could tap into a gold mine of volunteer talent.
A generation of the population is entering retirement years and has skills you
need (think computer and business savvy), good health and energy, and time
to commit to your cause. This generation has also paid their corporate dues
and longs to get back to the altruistic orientation of their younger years.
What are you waiting for?
Here are some things to consider in attracting senior volunteers:
 These people want to feel their continued value to society. Volunteering
is a structured way to feel like part of something worthwhile.
 Some retired people use volunteer work as a way to reproduce the role
they played in a paying job.
 Older volunteers may need special considerations in terms of asking
them to do certain types of work (lifting 50 pound boxes is out!) or need-
ing handicapped access to your facilities.
 Never underestimate these vital, energetic, and intelligent people who
are smart and have life skills to contribute to your mission. People in
their 60s and 70s are much more active and productive than they have
ever been.
How do you find these folks? Go make a speech at the local senior center,
connect with somebody at an adult condominium community, or do a mailing
to the homeowners in a more affluent housing development that is known to
be home to many retirees.

W
hat do you really need in order to raise funds? Sadly, you can’t survive
on your good intentions and good will. No donor wants to give to a
disorganized organization.
You may work for the best cause in the world, but if you can’t demonstrate
(1) what you have, (2) what you need, (3) how you’ll go about getting it, and
(4) how you’ll account for it after you receive it, you won’t raise much money.
In addition to supporting your cause, you have to support the clients, staff,
and operations of your organization.
In this chapter we talk about the fundraising plan, your road map, a modus
operandi for the resources that will no doubt come pouring in after you get
your plan together and begin putting it in action. You find out the various
steps involved in putting the plan together. Then we can bat around a few
ideas for ways that you can evaluate your plan’s progress and improve the
plan as you go.

Getting Familiar with Fundraising Terms
Don’t get bogged down in fundraising semantics. Here we present some
terms that you’re likely to see in any discussion of a fundraising plan:
 Market: This simply means where you look for funds. Do you count on
churches for the bulk of your support? Do you reach out to foundations
for your dollars? Does your existence depend on individual donor gifts?
The market is the area you turn to in order to fundraise.
 Vehicle: In the real world, you choose a different vehicle depending on
where you want to go. If you need to go to the corner store, you use your
feet — or a bicycle. If you’re going off road you need an SUV. In fundrais-
ing, different vehicles take you different places, too. You might choose
the annual fund (discussed in Chapter 18), the capital campaign (cov-
ered in Chapter 20), or planned giving strategies (check these out in
Chapter 21) to build different aspects of your organization and meet dif-
ferent needs.
 Strategic analysis: This sounds like what it is — strategic analysis
enables you to analyze your strategy — or develop one if you do not yet
possess one — and find out what your fundraising needs are, what
resources you have available, and what kind of plan will help you
achieve your goals.
Drafting the Perfect Plan
Remember the case statement (see Chapter 3 to read about the case state-
ment)? The fundraising plan is a different document; it includes the case
statement but also several other types of information. While your case state-
ment explains the philosophical need and response your agency provides to
that need, the fundraising plan goes further and lists specific steps you take
to raise the funds to serve your clients. You need a fundraising plan
 To help you recognize what you have to work with
 To define what you need
 To select your market
 To choose your fundraising vehicle
 To organize the steps required to put the fundraising plan in place
 To demonstrate to the outside world that you are organized and 
businesslike
76
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

As you write your plan, you should include the following items:
1. A clear statement of your mission (your case statement)
2. Your fundraising goal (what program or other goal you are raising
money for)
3. Your needs statement, explaining what your fundraising market and
resources are
4. Your financial target
5. Your selected vehicle
6. Your targeted markets
When you write up the plan you will include specific information, such as the
overall timeframe, the benchmark goals you want to make during that period,
resources you will be using, information on campaign leadership, and the fund-
raising budget for the campaign. (Not sure about that last part? Read on . . .
the last section in this chapter titled, “Budgeting Your Fundraising Efforts,”
deals with creating a fundraising budget.)
Starting with the case statement
The first step in building your fundraising plan is to write your organization’s
case statement — your carefully expressed reason for being, which we dis-
cuss in Chapter 3. If you don’t have a copy of your organization’s case state-
ment right there in front of you, go ahead and get it. We’ll wait.
Starting with the case statement is a must. This statement includes the goals
and objectives you set for your organization (see Chapter 3 to read about cre-
ating goals and objectives for your organization). Why do you need a case
statement before you can create a fundraising plan? Before you can make
sense of how to find money to support your purpose, you have to identify
what your overall purpose is.
Identifying your goals
Now that you’ve identified your mission with the case study, it’s time to iden-
tify what your organization wants to fund. Do you need to generate money for
programs? Are you raising funds for operating costs? Perhaps you want to
expand your offices or build an endowment.
77
Chapter 5: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan

Most nonprofit organizations have four primary fundraising goals. They need
funding for
 Programs
 Everyday operations
 Capital enhancements
 Building an endowment
Identifying your specific fundraising goals is key to setting up your plan. Just
saying “We have to raise money — for everything!” isn’t going to take you very
far. Whatever your fundraising goal, apply these three questions to that goal:
 Why do we want this?
 What tasks are involved in achieving this goal?
 How much will it cost?
Your answers to these questions need to be focused and specific. What you
come up with eventually becomes your goal statement.
Building a needs statement
After you create the case statement laying out your mission, and identify
your specific fundraising goal, you have to answer the question, “How do we
meet our mission and reach this goal?” The answer to that question is really a
list of questions that help you define the big picture of your fundraising plan:
 What resources do you have?
 What resources do you need?
 Which fundraising vehicle is the right one?
 Which market do you want to approach?
Armed with the answers to these questions, you can create a needs state-
ment that summarizes how you go about raising funds in the first place. You
also begin to see a clearer picture of which of these factors you already have
in place that you can draw from and what you still need to do before you can
go further in implementing a fundraising plan.
Be sure that the people who will carry out the plan are part of creating the
plan. Nobody wants to hear, “We just decided that our goal is to raise
$1,000,000 this year. Do you think that you can do that?”

Assessing your existing resources
The case, goal, and needs statements lay out your overall approach, but the
next step in your fundraising plan is to assemble specific information to
include in it and people to help drive it. In most cases you don’t have to start a
fundraising plan from scratch. You probably have a lot of information and
people already available. If your agency has done fundraising in the past in any
sort of organized way, you may be able to find the following essential items:
 The donor list
 Histories of how much your donors have given in the past
 Fundraising strategies used in the past — and how effective they were
 Any market studies done by your organization gauging public awareness
of your organization
 Public relations materials used in the past (membership brochures,
annual reports, copies of press releases, and so on)
 A list of potential donors
 Volunteers or staff who have participated in past fundraising efforts
 Board members experienced in fundraising
 A detailed, specific program or campaign that directly addresses the
needs statement
Before you start writing a fundraising plan you have to get into fact-finding . . .
also known as getting all your ducks in a row. Investing some time now to
investigate what’s been done before can save you valuable time and help you
focus your efforts and resources. If you discover, for example, that a program
appeal fell flat two years ago, you can carefully investigate the “whys” behind
that bomb before you launch something similar. Likewise, if you happen
across a volunteer who turns out to be a whiz at making connections, you
may have a great ally that you otherwise may have missed.
Determining what resources you need
After you have a sense of what resources you already have, you can deter-
mine what resources you need. What might you need in order to get organ-
ized to raise funds? Following, we list items and people you need to add to
your resource list before beginning your organized effort:
 Updated mission statement and goals
 A development committee (not a must, but helpful if you have the
people power)
79
Chapter 5: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan

 A complete slate of board members (if there are empty seats, fill them!)
 A donor list
 A development staff person
 Training for your board in fundraising
 An assessment of public opinion regarding your organization
Setting your financial targets
How do you know how much money you need to raise? The leadership of
your organization — the board, the executive director, and the program
director — should be the ones to provide that information. You may be in on
the discussions, of course, especially when they get to the “Do you think that
this is doable?” part, but the financial targets are really up to them to decide.
As you think about your fundraising financial goals, fight the temptation to
get stuck in the present moment, considering your immediate — and perhaps
emergency — needs. If you are in a situation in which you are worried about
keeping the doors open, it may be hard to consider a three- or five-year fund-
ing plan. However, having a far-reaching vision is one of the best insurance
policies for reaching a distant destination. If you can’t see it in your future,
you can’t plan for it.
Not long ago, working on an annual campaign for a major nonprofit organiza-
tion, we were aiming at a goal of $300,000, which was made up mostly of
small gifts. But twice during that campaign, people walked into the office,
took out their checkbooks, and said something like, “You know, I’ve been
coming here for more than five years and just love it. Here’s a check for
$25,000.” We were floored both times. The moral of the story? Count on the
smaller gifts, but don’t forget to cultivate the major gifts along the way.
Plan your fundraising targets for
 The present, which may be funding for a summer program, the acquisi-
tion of a van, or the salary of a special speaker
 The short term, which may be the next semester, the next year, or until a
specific program ends
 The long term, which may be a five-year plan or a plan for an endow-
ment fund
Some organizations do extensive testing before they set and announce a
fundraising target. In a capital campaign, for example, much of the work is
done — and a good portion of the money already raised through major lead
gifts — before the campaign is announced publicly. Why? Because success
breeds success, and people like to give to a campaign that is going well.
80
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

When you can announce your $5 million capital campaign and present graphs
that illustrate that you are already 35 percent of the way to your financial
goal, you inspire others to give.
The all-powerful Gift Range Chart
One tool that is extremely helpful in planning for the realization of your finan-
cial goal is a Gift Range Chart. These charts are often used for large campaigns
like a capital campaign. They enable you to determine how many large gifts
you need in order to reach different benchmarks in your target amount. For
example, suppose that the first benchmark of your three-year fundraising
plan is to raise $250,000 the first year. The Gift Range Chart can help you find
out how many gifts at various levels you need in order to reach that goal.
Table 5-1 charts it out for you:

Although an old fundraising joke goes, “It’s easy to raise a million dollars! Just
find a willing millionaire to write you that one big check!” — in reality, it is the
multitude of smaller gifts, along with those well-cultivated major gifts, that
bring you to your goal.
Getting the right vehicles on board
A fundraising vehicle is any of the campaigns, events, grants, and so on that
you use for your overall fundraising strategy. When you begin a fundraising
campaign, you decide where you want to go — what your fundraising goals
are. The vehicle is the means of reaching your goals. If you know that you
want to increase your donor base by 12 percent, for example, and hit a
fundraising goal of $300,000 by year’s end, you have established the end
point. What you then need is to choose the right fundraising vehicle or vehi-
cles to get you there.
81
Chapter 5: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan

Understanding the different vehicles
What are the standard fundraising vehicles?
 Annual campaign: A yearly fundraising campaign to raise support for
operating expenses
 Major gifts: May be a one-time gift or repeated large gifts given to sup-
port a particular program, project, or improvement
 Capital campaign: Adds to an organization’s assets, for example a 
building
 Planned gifts: Adds to the endowment of the organization
How do you choose a fundraising vehicle? The answer depends on your
needs statement. If you are raising funds for day-to-day operations, you want
to create an annual fund campaign to reach that end. If you are focusing on
building an endowment for your organization, think of the planned giving
vehicle. Table 5-2 gives you a quick look at the different types of vehicles
used for different fundraising purposes.

Goal-setting tips
Here are some tips to help ensure that you set
attainable goals:
 Make sure that those involved in the
fundraising are involved in the goal setting 
as well.
 Be specific about how much you want to
raise. Do not use vague phrases such as,
“as much as we can get.”
 Set benchmarks for the campaign. Know
how many $1,000 gifts you want to obtain by
a certain date, for example.

Planned giving
Endowment funding
Planned gifts are major gifts
made from the donor’s estate;
these gifts are traditionally
large and carefully planned.
Direct mail appeals or telephone soliciting programs are not campaigns. In
some discussions, you may see these types of fundraising programs referred
to as vehicles, but they are really tools that you employ while you’re working
with one of the vehicles listed here. For example, you may use a direct mail
or telephone approach for your annual campaign. We talk about direct mail in
Chapter 10 and phone solicitation in Chapter 13.
What about special events? We didn’t forget the black tie and tails you have
hanging in the back of your closet. Special events can be great fundraisers if
done right. When you generate a windfall with your special event, unless
you’ve publicized that the proceeds will be used for a particular purpose, the
moneys you raise can go wherever you need them: the operating fund, the
capital campaign, a special project, programming, or the endowment fund.
We talk more about special events in Chapter 19.
Creating a vehicle comparison worksheet
If you have a track record to use, look back through your fundraising budget
for past campaigns. How much did you raise for your annual fund? What did
you spend raising that amount? Compare and contrast similar numbers for
your direct mail campaign, your donor renewal program, and your special
events. Where did you break even? Where did you make significant money?
Where did you take a loss? Use Table 5-3 to help you think things through.

Discovering fundraising markets
The next step is to identify your markets: From where do you raise the major-
ity of your funds? Again, if you are an existing organization, you have data
that gives you that information pretty quickly. If you are just starting up, you
need to put some thought and planning into where you should begin.
If you work in a large organization, you are at an advantage because you most
likely have all the data you need on past campaigns and their fundraising
results. Look through the data carefully, but don’t get stuck in the past. Think
about current economic trends, community issues, and the cultural climate
before deciding on the right market and the right vehicle for your effort.
The best fundraising plans don’t focus too heavily on any one area, but mix
and match constituencies to make sure that they are raising both short- and
long-term funds all the time. Consider the markets in Table 5-4 and think
about the amount of time it takes to receive a gift from each.

Description
Individual donors


Donors comprise the biggest cat-
egory of givers; short-term donors
may contribute to the annual
fund; long-term donors, through a
cultivated relationship with the
agency, may develop into major
givers and donors interested in
making a planned gift. The goal is
to get repeated gifts to the annual
fund and cultivate donors into
other giving programs as well.
Affinity groups

Affinity groups, such as profes-
sional associations or special
interest groups, are usually a
source of short-term, program-
matic funding; a specific time
period is usually applied.
Churches


Depending on your relationships
with sponsoring churches, you
may receive specific program
support or ongoing operational
support. Although you may
receive small to medium gifts
from many churches consistently,
the likelihood that you will get a
major gift from a church is small.
The best market for major gifts is
in your relationships with individ-
ual donors, which may come to
you through a church contact.
Corporations


Corporations are often more
interested in funding a specific
program — something they can
see their name on — than in pro-
viding for operational expenses
or endowment concerns. For a
short-term relationship, corpora-
tions may supply program or
equipment grants; a long-term
relationship can be developed
with a corporation that serves as
a partnering relationship.

Foundations

Foundations, by and large, are
interested in helping provide
solutions, which means pro-
grams, programs, and more pro-
grams. Generally, foundations do
not want to fund either annual
fund campaigns or the “bricks
and mortar” of capital drives. In
thinking about your funding
needs, coming up with a great
grant proposal for a specific pro-
gram that fits the mission of a
foundation is a great way to meet
short-term funding goals.
Government


Similar to corporations (but with a
lot more red tape), government
may be able to provide your or-
ganization with program-related
moneys, staff salaries, and per-
haps even ongoing operational
support. Long-term involvement is
possible, although you will not
build a sizeable endowment from
the support of government grants.
Where may you raise funds for a food pantry program, for example? If your
immediate service goes to those in your local community, that is a good
place to start. Meet with your development committee to brainstorm poten-
tial markets. Following, we show the list we came up with:
 Community foundations
 Local businesses
 Area churches
 Local arts organizations
 Individual philanthropists
 Direct mail appeal
When you start small, you aren’t working from an established or tried-and-
true plan. Begin with those closest to you — people you see often, vendors
you work with, community organizations that work with you in similar
causes. As your circle widens, so does your market. Although shooting for
86
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

the big grant from the major foundation is a worthwhile and perhaps prof-
itable act, your overall fundraising plan will be healthier for the long term if
you build the steady support with gifts from a variety of sources — many of
whom should be close to home.
Avoiding Plan-Busters Like the Plague
Throughout this chapter, we talk about things you can do to put together
your fundraising plan and ensure its success. But there are several red flags
that you need to watch out for along the way. Following, we list a few of the
major ones:
 Not knowing your mission: Seems pretty basic, doesn’t it? Basic, but
essential. You aren’t going to be able to raise any money for your organi-
zation unless you know why your agency exists and what need you’re
meeting. Make sure that you have a strong, clear case before you even
think about fundraising.
 Choosing the wrong leadership: The leadership for your fundraising
efforts has an enormous amount to do with the way others perceive their
roles in a campaign. A positive, can-do person with a willing attitude and
strong connections can make a huge difference in a leadership role.
 Having unrealistic expectations: If you raised $100,000 last year, you
may be shooting too high to aim for $300,000 this year. Be realistic in
your needs statement and in the goals you set as a result.
 Dealing with bad timing: If your organization has recently suffered a
setback in the news — a board member resigned in anger; a legal suit is
pending; a large funder just denied a gift — this may not be the best time
to launch a fundraising campaign. Better to do damage control now, wait
until a better moment, and try again later. Conversely, if you’ve just had
a big win, consider getting your campaign going on the coattails of your
success.
 Doing too much at once: Are you starting your annual campaign while
running a capital campaign and planning an endowment campaign? Fight
the temptation to overdo. Although all components are necessary and
needed, you can burn out your donors and confuse them with mixed
appeals. Better to be clear and consistent — and build your fundraising
programs slowly, over time.
Can you run an annual fund and a capital campaign at the same time? Sure
you can — and many organizations do. But there could be a danger involved.
People and corporations who normally give to your annual campaign may
think that their capital donation takes care of that contribution as well — and
as a result, your annual fund could come up short this year.
87
Chapter 5: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan

To counteract that problem, make your annual fundraising efforts clearly dis-
tinct from your capital campaign, and be willing to say to Joe Donor, “We
really appreciate your donation to our capital campaign, Joe. Your contribu-
tion will help us create a beautiful atrium for patients. And by increasing your
annual gift to our annual fund, you can make sure that even a greater number
of patients are able to use our services and enjoy the new atrium.”
See Chapter 18 to find out more about annual campaigns; for capital cam-
paigns, see Chapter 20.
Budgeting Your Fundraising Efforts
You’ve no doubt heard the phrase “it takes money to make money.” Fund-
raising dollars are spent to raise funds — that’s a fact that some donors may
question if your fundraising efforts seem too extravagant. You are in the busi-
ness of raising money and you had better go about it in a businesslike way.
To meet your goals most effectively — raising the funds your organizations
need in order to meet the focus of their missions — you need to walk a fine
line that includes careful planning, budgeting, and accounting for the moneys
you bring in and spend.
A budget is a financial plan that shows how you intend to use your resources
to pay the expenses you incur to fulfill your mission. Your budget, which is
approved by your board, is an important planning instrument and a way in
which you show potential funders — whether those funders are individuals,
88
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
When opportunity strikes . . .
Out of the blue, a bolt of awareness may elec-
trify your cause. For example, take the horren-
dous tragedy of school shootings. This issue
has stirred up (and rightfully so) discussion on
issues related to teens and families, gun con-
trol, media responsibility, and more. If your
agency has a mission related to any of these
areas, you have experienced firsthand the cur-
rent of societal awareness as it turned in your
direction.
Although you cannot prepare for such occur-
rences when you are setting up your fundrais-
ing plan, be aware of the pulse of your
environment. Identify issues that are related to
you and keep your eye on them. Take advantage
of stories in the news — when the link is gen-
uine — to help potential donors understand
better than ever how your organization can help
battle the ill they are concerned about.
Does this sound distasteful, as though it is in
some way exploiting tragedy? In a circum-
stance as horrendous as school shootings, 
with the wave of pain — both personal and cul-
tural — that follows, a natural need for healing
and action comes soon after. If your organiza-
tion can be a legitimate part of that healing and
can help provide some of the answers that will
keep such horrors from happening again, that’s
not exploitation — that’s a real opportunity to
further your mission.

corporations, or foundations — the black-and-white detail of your fiscal
responsibility.
Who drafts the budget? The budget is one of those important items that
requires a team to complete it. You may do the first draft of the general
budget, if you are the executive director. As a development person, you may
be asked to draft the fundraising portion of the overall budget. But, similar to
the case statement, be prepared to answer questions and make changes after
the board review. And it’s never a bad idea to fly your proposed budget past
your financial officer first, just to make sure that you didn’t miss anything.
Making sure you include everything 
in your budget
The categories in your individual budget vary depending on the type of work
your organization does. There are a few givens, however. When you are plan-
ning out the expenses of your fundraising program, be sure to consider costs
in all the following areas (the top four are likely to apply only to larger agen-
cies and organizations; smaller organizations or community groups may have
only one or two paid staff, if any):
 Salaries and wages
 Pension plan contributions
 Employee benefits
 Payroll taxes
 Supplies
 Telephone and Internet access
 Web site design and maintenance
 Utilities
 Postage and shipping
 Rent
 Equipment costs
 Printing and publications
 Travel
You may be familiar with Form 990 — the IRS form that nonprofits use to pro-
vide full disclosure of their activities and finances. While you are putting
together your budget, think about data you need for the completion of your
990 and plan your budget categories accordingly. (You can get a copy of the
Form 990 online at www.irs.gov.)
89
Chapter 5: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan

Figuring out the cost of profit
So how much money does it take to make money? Different types of vehicles
require different investments, but the range runs from 10 cents on the dollar
for major gifts, planned giving, and capital campaigns to 50 cents per dollar
raised for special events. This range of costs is another good reason to make
sure that you select the right vehicle.
Some nonprofits make it a part of their “good stewardship effort” to keep
their overhead costs — in the administration and fundraising areas — as low
as possible. The United Way, for example, prides itself on keeping overhead
costs to less than 10 cents on the dollar. Other organizations make every
effort to ensure that most of the contributions they receive are applied to
their mission.
In recent years, we’ve seen stories in the media about charitable organizations
that take huge cuts for themselves — paying exorbitant salaries and taking
huge liberties — from the dollars their supporters provide. These few organi-
zations have created a cloud of suspicion that a fundraiser must overcome —
today’s donors want to know where their money is going and see evidence
that it is, in fact, going where you say it’s going. For this reason, you need to
be open and forthcoming with your financial information, and keep your
fundraising and overhead costs as low as possible. This open communication
is an important part of creating a solid, respectful donor-agency relationship.
Knowing when to outsource 
and when to hire
One big question for many smaller nonprofits is when — and if — to hire a
development staff member. Can the cost be justified? Should you really be
thinking about adding a salary when you are still worrying about paying the
rent from month to month? Common experience seems to prove that hiring a
professional to create and carry out development efforts more than pays
back the expense, but still, this is a big step.
We work with a religious nonprofit that has been struggling lately with this
very issue. The question was posed: “If we had the money, what would we do
next: hire a development person or a part-time outreach minister?” Much
debate ensued and finally it was decided to go with the development person.
The thinking was that hiring a development person was the way to grow the
organization, which would ultimately bring in the additional minister.
90
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

Every organization faces similar dilemmas at various stages of growth. It
helps to return to your mission statement, your goals, and your objectives
whenever a major planning decision comes into play.
If you aren’t ready to bring a development person on staff, you have other
options available. You can train a corps of volunteers, but that can be a hefty
responsibility if you’re thinking about doing a substantial fundraising cam-
paign. Another option is to contract with a third-party company or consult-
ancy. From feasibility studies to campaign strategies, from plans to event
management and reporting, third-party businesses are ready, willing, and
able to take over campaign leadership and planning. Think about the pros
and cons to putting this work into the hands of others who may not be work-
ing from the same point of passion that you and your board are coming from.
Consider a compromise solution: Hire the third party to work closely with
your board to design the campaign, and then let impassioned volunteers do
the actual fundraising work.
People who have a passion for your mission must do the actual execution of
the fundraising plan, or you’ll fall short of your goal and perhaps lose some
good relationships in the process.
Observe two sides to the outsourcing issue — you’ll find it to be a hot and
lively debate if you climb into the middle of it. The best advice here is to
think through both sides carefully.
Good reasons to outsource may be
 Your stakeholders are ready and you have the interest and ability to
launch a fundraising campaign but not the necessary leadership.
 You’re preparing to start your first fundraising effort and want to benefit
from the expertise of an experienced consultancy.
 You have a close working relationship with the third-party agency and feel
that their objectivity would help you create and run a better campaign.
Good reasons to hire a development professional into your organization
instead of outsourcing may be
 You’re a startup organization and want one person to coordinate the
design and implement the entire fundraising system.
 You feel that having a person on staff who is in alignment with your mis-
sion is critical to successful fundraising.
 You have salary moneys available (well, this doesn’t happen every day!)
and you want to bring in a person to work in relationship with your board
to help the entire organization take a more active role in fundraising.
91
Chapter 5: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan

Sometimes, just telling the board, “It’s time to hire a development person!” is
enough to get them thinking more seriously about ramping up their fundrais-
ing efforts.
Whatever you decide, be prepared to discuss the issue long and hard. Whether
you choose to outsource development or hire a new staff member, finding 
the right person for the right job is a key ingredient in making the whole
system work.
Remember that outsourcing doesn’t have to be all or nothing: You may want
to work with a consultant on the development of your mission statement, the
planning of a specific campaign, or the training of key fundraising members of
your board and staff.
Using fundraising software
Fundraising software can help you organize your fundraising plan and your
donor lists and provide valuable reports and analysis of your results. Should
you make the investment to not only buy the software but also to transfer all
your data into it? The answer is yes, yes, yes!
First, the odds are you don’t have to reinvent the wheel here. You can prob-
ably import the donor lists you now keep in a spreadsheet or word process-
ing program into most mainstream fundraising programs. After you have your
current data in such a program, here are the areas in which you can expect to
reap benefits:
 Donor management, including cross-references among family members
and co-workers
 Volunteer management, including scheduling and tracking of hours
worked
 Membership management, including keeping track of renewal notices,
membership cards, and more
 Pledge processing with cash-flow projections and delinquent notices
 Major gift management, tracking memorial gifts, and generating auto-
matic acknowledgements
 Direct mailing and other campaigns
Yes, you may have to spend some time inputting data into the software, and
yes, you may have to spend some more time training volunteers and staff to
use it. But in the end, it makes your organization keep track of all the details
92
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 

more efficiently, and your organization profits from keeping a record of its
activities, which helps you develop and grow.
Here are some fundraising software products worth a look:
 DonorPerfect (www.donorperfect.com) has a lot of cool features; you
can purchase the software or buy a monthly subscription online.
 FundRaiser Software (www.fundraisersoftware.com) is a simple-to-
use fundraising software tool. The basic version is priced at only $89
(but check for current pricing!).
 eTapestry (www.etapestry.com) is a Web-based fundraising software,
which makes it easy to update your records from anywhere, not just
from a single office location. If several people work on your records from
their homes, rather than a centralized office, this is a logical option.
You may also consider Internet-based member relationship management sys-
tems. You pay a monthly fee for the service that provides you with online
tools for managing and tracking online campaigns. A leading example of a
member-relationship management system is GetActive (www.getactive.com),
which starts at $1,050 per month. A lower-cost, less-polished example is
MemberClicks (www.memberclicks.com), which can be as low as $50 per
month. See Chapter 17 for more about use of online fundraising techniques.
Many companies offer free trial versions of their software that you can down-
load and try to see if it’s right for you.

A stakeholder is, logically, anybody who has some stake in what you do. Your
work impacts them in some positive way. Your failure may have the opposite
effect. These are the people you want to research as possible donors. Stake-
holders may be board members, staff, volunteers, clients your agency serves,
or vendors and corporate contributors to your cause.
Different agencies may have different types of stakeholders. Here’s a list of
people who may be invested in what you do and who may just be able to
make a greater investment:

 Your clients: These are the beneficiaries of your services. Who can
better understand how worthwhile your mission is than those who have
experienced it firsthand? For example, the family of an Alzheimer’s
patient who found a daytime caregiver and developed better coping
skills through your organization is a potential contributor. The patient’s
family members believe in your cause because they have had a personal
connection with it.
 Current and past donors: Current donors are those who believe enough
in what you do to donate their time, energy, talent, and money to your
cause. Past donors are the people who have given to you in the past but,
for whatever reason, may not be giving now. At some point, your cause
inspired them to give, so it can again.
 Major donors: These are the people who give at a high level and are
already aligned with your mission and your message. They have made
the connection between spark and action and already support you, per-
haps with their time and effort as well as their dollars. See Chapter 21
for more about major donors.
 Your staff: These are the champions of your cause. You know that your
staff members believe in the work they do because they commit a signifi-
cant amount of time and energy to fulfilling your mission. Staff members
are in the unique position of being able to see the results of what you do
and have a sense of the continuing and far-reaching possibilities of your
organization. For example, staff members of a research think tank see
the research being done, the people benefiting from that knowledge, and
the possibilities for the future. Staff members in an arts organization see
increasing support for the arts, productions of exciting programs, and
strong and growing arts education programs. Your staff, believing in the
mission, is a logical potential donor pool for your organization.
 Your board: These are the people who steer the course for your agency.
Who should believe in the work you do more than your board members?
Your board members care enough to commit their time, their effort,
their vision, and often their professional and personal resources; they
should also be giving financially.
Chapter 4 talks about the importance of having a board committed to
the cause and the need to get everybody giving. Foundations look for
100 percent board giving as one of the criteria for funding. But beyond
that, having a board that includes all-giving members is a good example
for all the other stakeholders, from staff to volunteers to clients.
 Neighboring organizations: These are people or groups in your commu-
nity that benefit from the services you offer. Certainly you have agencies
and businesses in your area that are glad you exist. For example, per-
haps you buy used vans for a meal-delivery service from a particular
dealership. The dealership is probably glad to get your business and
may make a good potential donor. Or, if a local community theater works
in tandem with a larger theater arts agency from time to time, the
agency may be a good source of donations of money, costumes, or
98
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

props. Similarly, the human services agency in your area may be able to
come up with a list of collaborative possibilities, such as groups you
know in your agency’s category and the people these groups work with
and serve.
Recognizing Your Bread and Butter:
Individual and Small Contributions
As we note in Chapter 1, individuals give more to charitable organizations
than any other giving group. Gathering all those many small donations can
really add up: In fact, they typically add up to more than any single large gift
resulting from that grant, corporate sponsorship, or other large gift you’ve
been hoping for.
The smartest nonprofit organizations don’t stop with getting the $25 dona-
tion from Mr. X each year in the annual fund drive. They want to bring Mr. X
along, first securing his gift for a repeat year and then upgrading it to a higher
amount. Over time, Mr. X gets more involved with the organization and con-
tinues to give at a higher level. Ultimately, his involvement may lead to a
high-level gift, such as a major gift, a lead gift in a capital campaign, or a
bequest for your organization’s endowment.
Small gifts are so valuable because they have the potential to grow into large
gifts through a continuing relationship with the donor.
Understanding donor levels
Donors come in all shapes and sizes, as well as giving levels. Your organization’s
fundraising environment is comprised of four distinct levels of involvement:
 Level 1: People closest to the heart — and hopefully the passion — of
your organization, including members of your board, agency managers,
and major givers
 Level 2: People who work with or are served by your organization,
including volunteers, staff, general donors, members, patrons, and
clients
 Level 3: People who may have given to your organization in the past but
are not active givers now
 Level 4: People in the general population you haven’t reached yet who
have interests compatible with your mission but who as yet don’t know
you exist
99
Chapter 6: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors

Figure 6-1 gives you an idea of the four levels of donor involvement in relation
to one another. These four levels represent the groups and individuals in
your immediate fundraising environment.
Capturing data on possible donors
Write down any names that come to mind in each of the top three donor
levels. Later you can plug the data into your donor tracking system (see the
section, “Designing an Effective Research System,” later in this chapter) so
you can follow up on it.
 First, identify by name those people involved with your organization at
Level 1.
 Now list the Level 2 donors. If you have a small volunteer group or staff,
you can list the individuals by name if you want. Make notes to remind
yourself of specific people to look up, resources to use, or people to
interview for fact-finding in each of these areas.
 Next, list your Level 3 prospects. Record any people you know of who
have fallen off your organization’s “active” list.
When people stop giving, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ve fallen out of
their favor. Maybe they need a reminder. Maybe they need a “we’ve missed
you!” note. People who have given in the past are more likely to give than
those who have never given to your organization. Make the most of your
existing resources to help build your list and keep it active.
Level Four:
• General population
• Possible donor with
compatible interests
Level One:
• Board members
• Agency management
• Major givers
Level Three:
• Former donors
• Past clients
• Family members of former donors
Level Two:
• Volunteers
• Staff
• General donors
• Members
• Patrons
• Clients

Doing Business with Corporate Donors
In recent years corporations have come to realize that they get a double ben-
efit from giving to nonprofit organizations. They up their socially responsible
image from a public relations standpoint, and they retain employees by sup-
porting the causes their employees are interested in. Beyond the benefit of
corporate giving, employees of these companies strengthen volunteer pro-
grams at these nonprofits and may even serve as giving board members or
major donors.
Here are a few questions you can ask as you think about how and whom to
approach for corporate giving:
 Which corporations give to your organization now?
 Which corporations in your area would have a link to your mission?
 Which corporations give to organizations that are similar to yours?
 Which of your board members, if any, have direct links to corporations?
 Whom do you know at any of the potential donor corporations?
 Which local corporations could you invite to participate on your board?
 What corporations might benefit from the positive publicity of being
involved with your mission?
If you don’t have any strong personal, peer-to-peer links to someone at a cor-
poration in your area, subscribe to your local business journal or get the
member lists published by your local Chamber of Commerce. The member
list includes all kinds of companies, such as major electrical contractors,
banks, real estate companies, and insurance businesses that you can
approach for a corporate donor relationship.
Cause-related marketing is a popular approach for corporations that also ben-
efits nonprofit organizations by linking them with a business. The business
provides needed equipment or services for the nonprofit, and the nonprofit
provides visibility in the community for the business by advertising the help
it received. The business then benefits from the “good guy” image and the
organization benefits from the exposure and the share of the proceeds they
receive. For example, a computer company forms a link with an organization
that works with kids with disabilities, or a local business may make itself a
visible patron to a particular theatre or musical organization.
If your mission has national or international appeal, you aren’t limited to your
local area. Your research should continue on a larger scale. Start with the top
corporate givers featured in the publication Giving USA (www.givingusa.org).
Work through the list and see which corporate giving programs fund the type
of programs you offer.
101
Chapter 6: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors

Additionally, keep on top of who’s who at various corporations and keep your
thumb on the pulse of the giving market. Print resources can be handy; order
them online or from your local bookstore.
Note that some of these publications carry a big price tag, sometimes six
hundred or more dollars. To keep your costs down consider buying a new or
used copy, but don’t skimp and buy an older edition. Always buy the most
current edition: it’s worth it.
The following publications can provide a resource for your corporate 
fact-finding:
 Corporate Giving Directory 2004, Taft Group, ISBN: 1569954674.
 The Chronicle of Philanthropy, http://philanthropy.com.
 Fistful of Dollars: Fact and Fantasy About Corporate Charitable Giving,
Linda M. Zukowski, EarthWrites, ISBN: 0966131428.
 Giving by Industry: A Reference Guide to the New Corporate Philan-
thropy 2003, Michael Abshire (Editor), Aspen Pub., ISBN: 0834221470.
 National Directory of Corporate Giving, The Foundation Center, ISBN:
1931923051.
Most big corporations publish a brochure about their corporate giving pro-
grams. Sometimes the programs are specialized and very focused, and some-
times the programs are general and support a wide range of causes. A common
thread runs through many corporate giving programs, however: they often are
interested in things their employees care about or in nonprofits that serve
communities where their employees live.
102
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
Different ways that corporations give
A giant multi-figure check might be the thing
you’d be happiest to see, but in fact, corpora-
tions give in a variety of ways:
 The ever-popular donation
 Matching gifts, in which the corporation
matches a gift made by an employee
 Encouraging volunteerism
 Donated equipment
 In-kind or pro bono services
 Donated space, such as office or ware-
house space
 Partnerships, as in cause-related marketing
or sponsorships for programs
 Foundation gifts
 Employee days off to volunteer as a group to
an organization or a group of organizations

Finding Foundations that Care
Foundation giving can be a great boon to your organization, but getting that
grant is sometimes a time-consuming and lengthy process. Do your home-
work, so you don’t waste your time or the foundation’s by submitting a grant
that doesn’t have a chance of succeeding. That means finding good research
sources that help you understand which foundation is likely to be a good
match to your mission.
The first step is to get your hands on the foundation giving guidelines to see
what types of organizations they tend to fund. In addition, check out some of
these resources for foundation knowledge:
 The Foundation Center, http://fdncenter.org: Find useful statistics,
links, and even online orientations about becoming a successful grant
seeker here.
 Donors Forum of Chicago, www.donorsforum.org: There is useful
information here about the three types of foundation, independent, cor-
porate, and operating, as well as links to various foundation directories.
 Guidestar, www.guidestar.org: This online research site allows you to
post information about your organization that donors or grant makers
can browse to find matches to their mission. They also have information
about more than 118,000 private foundations. Guidestar’s Grant Explorer
product helps you look at historical information on foundation funding.
If you’re scouting foundations, you can get a foundation’s annual report by
simply calling the foundation and requesting it. (You can order most founda-
tions’ annual reports online now.) Foundations pay out a percentage of their
holdings in contributions. How much and in which different areas these foun-
dations have given is available to the public on request.
Asking Your Board All 
the Right Questions
Luckily, all the work of identifying potential donors doesn’t fall on your shoul-
ders. Your board is instrumental in helping to identify the people and resources
that can make your organization grow. The most important way to get your
board productive in advancing funding is to get them away from the regular
stuff they do and do a little dreaming about donor research and support. An
off-site meeting enables board members to let go of the operating expense
hassles and focus on the long-term picture.
103
Chapter 6: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors

What questions do you put to the board when you get their attention? You may
have a list of your own, but as you explore areas in which you find donors to
give to your cause, the two in the following sections are important:
Where did we forget to 
expand our donor base?
As you think through your strategic plan, you will probably discover unmet
needs you want to address. And because you are now exploring a new
market, these discoveries can uncover some more potential donors. This is
one way to expand your general donor base.
The following questions can help you explore areas that your organization
may not have thought about yet:
 Do we have new members or subscribers coming in regularly?
 Is our group growing or stagnating?
 What areas of activity could our organization be considering?
 Are any of our programs outdated or unnecessary?
 Have we identified new programs that would reach new populations?
 What is the average age of our members? Do we need to implement
strategies to reach a broader group of people?
For example, a symphony that plays primarily classical and pop music wants to
expand its donor base. Its members are worried that its current series isn’t
bringing in new patrons. The symphony needs to try something different. When
the board recognizes the need (“We need to reach a new group of people”), it
decides to take the symphony out into the community and change the musical
selections. The idea produces several new venues, including a hugely successful
program called Symphony on the Prairie, which brings the symphony out under
the stars with audience members listening from their blankets or tables — com-
plete with boxed dinners — in a natural amphitheater in the countryside. As the
success of the idea grows, corporations realize the benefit of providing clients
and families with a nice night out on the prairie, and as a result, the symphony
gains a huge audience in the corporate market.
In the medical field, this idea of discovered need appears in the area of pre-
ventive medicine. For example, years ago, the idea of prevention appeared to
work against the care that hospitals offered. Today, people realize that a
focus on prevention is better for patients, families, and even hospital sys-
tems. Patients quit their sick beds and hospitals open wellness programs.
And a new opportunity for giving appears. Today, people who may not want
104
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

to donate money to a new burn center for the local hospital may instead be
interested in helping fund the hospital’s accident-prevention program —
same donor, same hospital, different cause.
Who did we forget to ask?
In addition to the possibility of adding new programs that bring new donors
to your door, you may be (and probably are) overlooking potentially valuable
donors who are as close as your boardroom table. Remind your board mem-
bers to think of friends, colleagues, and other contacts they have who may be
interested in donating to the organization.
If your board is lukewarm about using its collective contacts, try a little
experiment. At the next board meeting, take a set of 3 x 5 cards, and five min-
utes before the meeting is adjourned, say, “I am working on donor prospect-
ing this week, and I’d appreciate it if before you left today, you’d list three
peers you feel that could be potential donors to our organization. And while
you’re at it, put a check mark beside those you’d like to suggest that we inter-
view as possible board members for the future.”
Using Table 6-1, list the potential donors your board members come up with
and add a few of your own, too. You can then find out more about the individ-
uals by talking to the board member who recommended them or doing your
own sleuthing. Write the donor’s or company’s name in the Potential Donor
column. In the Individual/Corporate column, you can write I or C to indicate
whether the donor represented is an individual or a corporation. Write the
contact’s name or how the potential donor is linked with your organization in
the Link/Contact column. In the “Ability to Give” column, you can write Y or N
to indicate whether the potential donor has the financial means to give. Finally,
the column “Links to Major Donors” indicates whether the donor may be able
to open the door to other people in positions of power or affluence. You can
indicate Y or N in this column.

Chapter 6: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors

Your donor list is your most important fundraising asset. Everything you do, all
your contacts, all your programs, is linked to the people on your donor list —
those who contribute and align with your mission. Remember that your vol-
unteers are also potential donors, and that treating them right, cultivating
them well, recognizing their contributions, and inviting them to participate at
ever-increasing levels is not only a smart business decision but also helps
build the donor/volunteer and donor/organization relationships.
Checking Out Philanthropists
Say that your board came up with some great names of potential donors for
you to follow up on. What do you do next?
Or maybe your board came up with a list of duds. Nobody has the type of
resources you are looking for. Now what?
These are two very different situations, so we look at each individually.
Pursuing promising prospects
You have a great list in front of you of 15 of the top givers in your city, with
links through the board members who know them personally. What do you
do next? Next, you need to do more homework.
Your homework now involves finding out personal, financial, and professional
information about the donor before you meet her so that you can strategize
the relationship you hope will develop. Your strategy includes finding out
what type of contribution the donor may be able to make to your organiza-
tion, what type of investment would appeal to her based on commitments
she has made to other causes, and how you will approach the prospective
donor when you meet her and when you ask for her commitment.
You need to know at least the following information about high-level donors
before you meet with them for the first time:
 The donor’s general financial picture
 Why he may care about your organization
 What other organizations he has given to
 How much money he has given
 His pet projects and high-level interests
 His accomplishments and awards
 The people in your community that he respects
106
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

The most effective fundraising takes place between peers, which means that for
the best results, the board member who identified Mrs. V. as a good prospect
should be the one to call on her. He is her link to the organization, he knows her,
and he can say, “You know, Gladys, I’m on the board of this organization, and I’m
really proud of what’s going on here. Last week when I visited the new wing we
just opened, I thought of you and Robert and how we all worked together to get
Mercy Hospital that state-of-the-art cancer center. I think that you’d be amazed
to see what we’re doing here for the kids. Would you like to come over for a tour
of our facility? I’d like to show you around myself. And maybe we can have
lunch together afterward, if you have the time.”
You can see that Mrs. V’s relationship with the board member is a key com-
ponent in furthering her interest in your cause. What’s simpler than a friendly
tour and lunch? And what could be more likely to entice a donor into giving
more toward the good work she can see being done at Mercy Hospital? See
Chapter 9 for more information about “the perfect ask.”
Finding the silver lining 
with unlikely prospects
Even if your board survey comes up dry, you still have plenty of places to
start to build your donor list and look for those high-level donors.
Begin with these ideas:
 Examine lists (public lists, that is) that similar organizations keep of
their donors. For example, an art museum looks at the patron list pub-
lished by the symphony and vice versa.
 Keep an eye on your community. If you get the local paper, you see
names of local philanthropists cropping up repeatedly in print. Likewise,
keep an eye on national, international, and online news if your mission
reaches farther than a local constituency. Watching, listening, and taking
notes can help you discover potential resources you may miss if you
don’t keep your fundraising eyes open.
 Visit the places where people go to be seen. Certain places in your
community are equated with a certain status. Perhaps one of the gather-
ing places is a formal garden, an elegant historical inn, or an arts center.
Visit these places and read the plaques on the walls; look at the named
statues in the garden; pour over the portraits on the walls. This type of
sleuthing can show you which families in your area have wealth — and
are using it to further causes that capture their imaginations and their
passions.
107
Chapter 6: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors

Researching the Internet Way
One of your best research tools today is the Internet. It provides a huge
amount of information that is easily searchable. You can use it 24 hours a day
and 7 days a week, where your local library or Chamber of Commerce may
close its doors every evening.
Here are some of the most useful tools and approaches to use when research-
ing online.
Browsing Web sites
There are all kinds of Web sites that could be useful to you in building a donor
list. Certainly if you are researching a potential corporate giver, you should
visit the corporation’s Web site. But here are some other sites to look for:
 Sources that giving information, such as The Foundation Center (fdtn
center.org). You find data, links, and articles to help you do what you do.
 Discussion boards related to your organization’s mission may give you
some ideas for future programs and how you approach potential donors.
By “listening in” on conversations about arts funding, for example, you
may get a better picture of your potential donors’ concerns and interests.
 Foundation and other giving organization sites to get annual reports and
press releases, as well as their funding guidelines.
Features such as bookmarking favorite sites, history lists of sites you’ve vis-
ited recently, and research tools can make your browsing experience much
easier.
Using search engines
Search engines abound online, and they’re very useful tools. But not all
search engines are created equal. The search tools each offers may vary,
allowing you to search with questions rather than keywords, for example, or
providing advanced search features to pinpoint your search more accurately.
Try out different search engines to see which one works best for you. Look at
the help for each engine to see how they recommend that you enter search
terms. For example, Google searches for sites that include all your search
terms first, where Yahoo! searches for sites that include any search term.
Usually sites that include all the words you enter are more appropriate to
what you want.
108
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

Locating people online
Donor research means that finding out about people and the Internet pro-
vides great resources for doing that. White pages for just about every town
can be browsed online. Here are other tools for finding people:
 Corporate sites often list board members or senior managers by name.
 Searching by a person’s name in a search engine may get you informa-
tion about the school they went to, a mention of them in a local newspa-
per article for a social event or corporate promotion, or some mention
of their personal interests or family.
 There are people-finder services you can use to find somebody when
you know her name and school attended, for example, but don’t have a
street address handy.
Exploring government sites
Government sites offer free information about trends in the economy that
may have an impact on future giving and regulations, tax benefits of giving,
and more. If you’re planning your fundraising strategy, you may find govern-
ment sites such as these useful:
 The IRS (www.irs.gov).
 The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (www.cfda.gov).
 Combined Federal Campaign (www.opm.gov).
 The US Nonprofit Gateway (www.firstgov.gov).
Also check out specific agencies related to your mission, such as the
Administration on Aging or the Administration for Children and Families.
Designing an Effective Research System
After you identify new donors, how do you keep track of all the information
you accumulate? Your donor research system should be comprehensive
enough to store all kinds of data from multiple meetings, because you’re
going to be meeting with potential high-level givers more than once or twice
and will need a way to essentially track an entire relationship. Such a system
requires a lot of time and planning.
109
Chapter 6: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors

Creating an effective donor research form
The following list outlines the most important categories of information you
need on your donor research forms or database records:
 Administrative Data: The date the form or record is created, the name
of the person creating it, and the way in which the donor was referred to
you (board member, other donor, friend, mailing, event, other)
 Name and Address: The first, middle, and last name of the donor; the
residential and business addresses; phone numbers and e-mail
addresses; and the donor’s title
 Interests and Business Affiliations: The donor’s professional position
and memberships; foundation or philanthropic interests; awards and
honors; key relationships; special interests; and political, religious, and
military affiliations
 Education: The educational background of the donor, knowledge of any
continuing relationship with his/her educational institution, and social
or business activities that tie him/her to education
 Family: The name of the donor’s spouse, children, parents, and pets,
including any significant or relevant information
 Resources: The names of the donor’s bank, financial planner, tax advi-
sor, and attorney
 Finances: Information on the donor’s income, assets, past contributions
made, and so on
 Gift Record: A listing of all gifts the donor has pledged and made to your
organization
 Visitation Record: A listing of all contacts made to the donor by you or a
member of your development staff or board
 Comments: A fill-in space for comments
These tips create a great-looking donor information form:
 Use more than one page if you need to. If you want the first page to
include quick-look items, fine, but be prepared to allow for two or three
pages of information for each donor.
 Make the form easy to follow and understand. Don’t crowd too much on
the page, and organize the categories of information in a logical fashion.
You may understand the order of the items on the form, but the person
who uses the form after you leave the organization may not.
 Provide a space for write-in visits.
110
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

 Include columns for totaling gifts and pledges.
 Create a good storage system of binders labeled clearly so you know
which records are kept there (A-D, Corporate Donors, or whatever).
Recordkeeping with computer programs
Most organizations these days have a computer, and if you do, we strongly
recommend keeping records in electronic form. They are easier to update,
print, and search. Here are some tips to starting your computerized donor list:
 Use a database program such as Microsoft Access, Excel, or Symantec’s
ACT! to organize records.
 If you prefer, find a program specifically geared to donor tracking.
Programs such as The Raiser’s Edge from Blackbaud (www.blackbaud.
com) or PG Calc (www.pgcalc.com) offer extra features beyond simple
database record organization. There are also many Web-based programs
you can use online without having to install an application on your 
computer.
 Make your records granular enough to be easily searchable and usable
in generating form letters. For example, don’t have a single field for
name, but instead have a first name and last name field. Then you can
use a mail merge feature to address a more personal fundraising letter to
Joe, rather than to Joe Smith.
Tracking campaign related information
Besides your general donor recordkeeping, another donor system you should
think about goes along with a specific fundraising effort. If you are gearing up
for a capital campaign, an endowment campaign, or simply wanting to build
your opportunities for major gifts, you should devise a plan that includes the
following pieces of information:
 The number of prospects you want to identify for major gifts
 The characteristics you are looking for in major donors
 The definition of a major gift in your organization
 A Gift Range Chart for this campaign
 The number of calls you plan to make per week
 Your fundraising goals for this quarter (for midyear; for the year)
111
Chapter 6: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors

Evaluating your data
After you identify and contact major gift prospects, evaluate the data you’ve
gathered so far. Ask yourself the questions in the following list to identify
areas of information you still need to obtain:
 Overall, have you been targeting the right prospects?
 Do you want to revise the characteristics you are looking for?
 What is the average size of the major gifts you are receiving?
 Is there any area where your major gift campaign is doing really well?
Are there areas that need improvement?
 What types of responses have you been getting from donors?
 Are you keeping up with your donor record-keeping system?
 Have you been making the calls-per-week goal you set for yourself?
 How close are you to achieving your quarterly, semiannual, and yearly
fundraising goals?
Review the data periodically to fine-tune your fundraising efforts and make
sure that they’re on track.
Keeping Confidence: The Issues and
Ethics of Handling Personal Data
Some things go without saying, but we’ll say this one anyway: When you
accumulate information on a person of means in your community, you have
something other people want. People at dinner parties would love to hear
about the net worth of Mrs. V. A con artist would be interested in knowing
that you’re doing research on wealthy older people in your region.
Fight the temptation to disclose what you’re working on — and certainly
respect the privacy of the people you are preparing to approach. The infor-
mation you’re gathering is meant to assist you in finding the right match —
both for the donor and for your organization — nothing more. When you find
the donor who shares your interest in an issue, who has the ability to give
and the motivation to do so, it’s an equitable, honorable relationship. You
help the donor make a difference in an area she cares about and she helps
you further your work. Everybody wins.

Divulging information about the person you are researching is bad business,
bad fundraising, and bad news. This makes the donor nothing more than a
mark you are approaching to “hit her up” for some cash. It’s not about
respectful relationships anymore. And you certainly won’t keep that person
as a donor and may get a reputation for lack of discretion that scares away
many other donors, as well.
Here are a few other ethical reminders you probably won’t need:
 Make sure that your board knows and approves your methods of donor
research.
 Carefully consider whether a donor would consent to this type of
research, or would be outraged to find that such research was being
done about her.
 Be careful about computer security. Don’t post lists on your Web site,
and don’t give access to your records to sharp computer hackers via the
Internet; protect your computers with firewall or other security software.
 If you are in doubt about a research practice, check it out with your CEO
or attorney.
If you leave your position at your current organization and go to work for a
similar agency, where does the donor information go? Whether you’re legally
bound by a confidentiality or non-compete clause in your employment con-
tract or not, information stays with your current organization — no question.

Meeting Your Donor
In This Chapter
 Realizing the impact of a visit
 Getting acquainted initially with your donor
 Understanding the donor-agency relationship
 Building the donor relationship
F
undraising is not for the fainthearted. And you’ll never be more aware of
that than when you sit down with your donors for the first time. What
should you do? Picture them in their underwear? Imagine a successful out-
come to your meeting? Be careful to present just the right image? All of the
above?
Smart fundraising isn’t a hit-’em-fast endeavor. It’s about relationship build-
ing, which enables donors to grow continually closer to your mission and to
help increasingly through their time, efforts, and gifts.
This chapter gives you insight into the motivations and potential hot buttons
of the donors you meet. You won’t be visiting every donor, of course. Uncle
Joe, who sends you a $15 check every year for your annual fund, won’t
expect you to appear on his doorstep to take him to lunch. But Mrs.
Benefactor, who gave a special gift to a program fund last year, would make a
good prospect for your endowment campaign. As part of building a relation-
ship with her, visits are expected and, hopefully, welcome.
Evaluating the Importance of a Visit
Attentiveness is key to building relationships in the world of donor cultiva-
tion. Mailings are fine, but you won’t draw a donor closer to the mission of
your agency or higher in the level of giving chart by sending her mailing after
mailing.
Phone calls are more personal than mailings as long as they are not construed
as telemarketing ploys — at least donors hear a warm voice and know they
are getting your personal attention — but for a potentially major, long-term

donor, plan to make regular visits. After all, you have a shared interest —
your organization and the work that it does. Take your donor to lunch, visit
her at home; bank on the fact that you are nurturing a far-reaching and, hope-
fully, continuously rewarding relationship.
When is the appropriate time to begin planning regular visits to a donor?
Donors need special, personalized treatment at the special gifts area level of
giving and above. Your goal is to secure the commitment of donors whose
philanthropic goals match those of your organization. The special gifts level
of giving is the first indication that the donor is willing to make a serious
commitment to your organization. When the donor gives you this first hint,
it’s up to you to take the ball and run with it. To nurture this important rela-
tionship, you need to do more research, make a greater effort, spend more
time, and create more opportunities for interaction with the donor.
Visits — and the time they take — let donors know that they are important,
their contributions matter, and you want them to be happy.
Introducing Yourself to Potential Donors
There are some donors who may have been giving to your organization for
several years. Some started out as volunteers helping with your big annual
event; others may have served on your board for a term or two. Over the
years, you may have sent them your quarterly newsletter and a few mail
appeals — one for your annual fund and another for a special program fund.
You can observe several things about these donors. They:
 Are engaged with the mission of your organization
 Have had enough of a good experience to keep coming back
 Have increased both their giving and their involvement over the last
three years
As you research prospective donors for major gift solicitation, various
donors’ names come up. You evaluate the donor files, educating yourself
about several key points:
 What contacts have been made with them
 What donations they have given
 What other affiliations they have
 Their potential for giving (that is, what can you deduce about their
financial status?)
116
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

Fully armed with a dossier of facts, you must set out to contact each of them
for a meeting.
You call a number, and your prospective donor answers. You’ve rehearsed
what you’re going to say:
“Hi, Mrs. Donor,” you say. “This is Jamie from New Beginnings. I was going
over our volunteer records and I see that you’ve been giving both time and
money to our organization for three years now.”
Mrs. Donor takes a minute to process the information.
“Well, we’re glad to help.” She says. “We’ve really enjoyed our time there.”
As the call continues, you tell Mrs. Donor that you’d like her and her husband
to be your guests at lunch, so you can thank them for their involvement and
introduce them to new happenings at your agency. Mrs. Donor says that
she’ll talk to her husband about it and asks you to call back on Monday.
When you call back as requested, the luncheon is scheduled.
Now, in order to make sure that these meetings go as smoothly as possible,
you need to think about:
 What motivates donors to give
 What you offer a donor who gives to your organization
 How charitable giving is really a win-win proposition
The following section helps you explore each of these different issues.
Examining the Giving Relationship
between the Donor and the Agency
Nonprofit organizations, or agencies, exist and thrive to help real people accom-
plish good works. It used to be that if someone in the community was ailing, you
could rally the support right there in the neighborhood, in the church, in the
family, to help the person in need. In today’s world, the needs are great and
complex, and spread around the globe. Nonprofit organizations exist to help
people help others — through giving money, time, effort, or material goods.
And, in exchange for all that the donor gives, the nonprofit offers something in
return. The relationship is not a one-sided one in which the only dynamic is that
the donor gives and the nonprofit takes. Both sides have tangibles and intan-
gibles, with the intangibles probably being the more important. These include:
117
Chapter 7: Meeting Your Donor

 The donor feeling like one of a selected group that is appreciated and
cultivated
 The organization feeling the security of being able to count on the
donor’s involvement and contribution year after year
An equal exchange exists, which enables the client to benefit from both the
donor and the organization.
Showing donors the value of their gifts
When donors give to your organization, what do they get in return? Hopefully
they see the effectiveness of their gifts — they have the assurance (and
proof, through newsletters, Web sites, or other communication) that their
money is going to what you said that it would go for. You show value to your
donors by providing them with the following services:
 Providing information: When you help a donor find out about planned
giving options, you are educating her about the various estate and tax
planning opportunities. By working with her financial advisor or tax
attorney, you can assist in designing the right giving plan to meet the
donor’s financial needs.
 Evaluating options: Your donor’s time is valuable. There’s a world of
information out there, especially regarding nonprofit organizations. You
can help your donor get informed and involved with an issue close to his
heart. When you communicate, clearly and simply, the mission of your
organization — in print, in person, or on the Web — you help him make
informed choices about the charitable organizations he wants to support.
 Interacting and corresponding regularly: You should regularly show
donors where their money is going, invite them in for a visit, and enlist
their help, care, and vision in building the organization. Donors get
involved, gain appreciation, and become part of a bigger system working
to solve the problems of the world at large.
 Being accountable: After you receive that first fundraising gift, you owe
your donor accountability — reporting on what effect the gift has had on
your clients, what good has come of it, and how you plan to continue the
growth in the future.
Getting more than money from the donors
What do donors offer the nonprofit? “Money!” you’re thinking. But that’s only
partially right. And it’s not even the important part. Although your donors
show their involvement through financial contributions (we hope), the most
important donation they are making is the donation of their belief. If donors
118
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

don’t believe in what you are doing and believe you are capable of carrying
out what you promise and are capable of helping the populations you serve,
they would not send you a check. The strength of the belief the donors have
for you may vary over time and circumstances, and it’s your job to keep that
belief strong and the interest growing. So don’t make the mistake of thinking
that your donors offer you only money. Some of the many critical intangibles
your donors provide are:
 Time in voluntary services
 Material goods donated
 Donations of services and resources
 Goodwill in conversations with friends
 Visibility for your organization: If you have a small organization and
you’re in the beginning stages of the process of building credibility and
reputation, here’s a tip on how to build that credibility: Go for the Good
Fundraising Seal of Approval. In your area, you probably have certain
companies and donors who are known for their philanthropic interests.
When one of these groups or individuals gives to a nonprofit organization,
the rest of the community thinks, “Oh, I guess that they have a pretty
good thing going — otherwise Mrs. Endrow wouldn’t give to them!” Look
for and identify where the Good Seals are in your area, and organize your
fundraising efforts to secure a donation from one of the key people.
 Furthering of your mission: As an organization, we receive the knowl-
edge that others are willing to join with us in our cause, the understand-
ing that we are doing something right, and the hope that our
organization will continue to grow and to change until the issue we
address is resolved.
119
Chapter 7: Meeting Your Donor
. . . And sometimes there’s a great, 
big tax benefit . . .
The Charity, Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment
Act (CARE) passed by Congress in 2003
enhances the value of charitable contributions
to the taxpayer under law.
Under this law, taxpayers can subtract all char-
itable contributions from their taxable income,
even if they do not itemize their taxes. The
second provision, for itemized returns, gives
taxpayers a tax credit rather than a tax deduc-
tion, which results in increased savings. Here’s
an illustration of how this works:
For example, if your taxable income is $100,000,
you have no deduction for charitable contribu-
tions; you’re in the 30 percent tax bracket, your
tax is $30,000.
(continued)

Checking out what motivates giving
Why do people give? When we threw this question to a classroom full of
fundraisers, they gave us these 20 whys to giving:
 Emotional response
 Tax deductions
 Belief in the cause
 Image
 Marketing
 Sense of belonging — joining something bigger than oneself
 Giving back to a cause that has helped us or someone we care about
 Getting good seats at a basketball game (personal gain)
 Peer influence
 Enjoyment
 Personal experience with the cause
 In memory of someone
 To set an example
 Pass on a legacy
120
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
Now suppose that you make a $500 charitable
contribution and deduct it from your gross
income. Then the math looks like this:
$100,000 income for the year – $500 charita-
ble contribution = $99,500 taxable income
$99,500 taxable income _×_ 30 percent tax
bracket = $ 29,850 tax ($150 saved)
Your $500 contribution saves you $150 in taxes
when taken as a deduction from taxable income
in the first proposal.
Under the second instance, the tax credit, you
can deduct the $500 contribution from the tax
liability and save even more:
$100,000 income for the year × 30 percent
tax bracket = $30,000 tax
$30,000 tax – $500 charitable deduction =
$29,500 tax ($500 saved)
In effect, your donation cost you nothing!
This example saves $350 more than the first,
which takes the deduction from your gross
income. The second example represents a good
savings that your donors will want to know
more about.
(continued)

 Honor
 Spiritual reasons (tithing)
 To have a voice in the larger discourse
 Empathy
 To make a difference
 Because the right person asked
We didn’t list these motivations in any particular order. We just want to show
that, although you may hope that people give to your organization because
they believe in your mission, tax deductions, marketing, or image may some-
times be a bigger reason why a particular donor gives.
If you think about how, when, and why you give to the charities you support,
you may identify with one or more of the reasons on the previous list. People
have all kinds of motivations for giving — some people-serving, some self-
serving. Some motivations have helping others as the goal; some motivations
are no doubt grounded in the hope of social influence. As a fundraiser, you
can’t judge givers’ motivations — the why is up to them. The what, how,
when, and, hopefully, how much is within your ability to guide when your
mission matches their motivation.
We asked the same fundraising class that gave us our list of giving motivations
earlier why they thought that donors don’t give. Their responses follow (and
they’re right on target, too):
 They weren’t asked.
 They’re unhappy with the way the organization is handling finances.
 Their interests and priorities have changed.
 Nobody said thank you the last time.
 They no longer have the resources to give.
 They didn’t like the manner in which they were approached.
 They’re insecure about the organization.
 The organization doesn’t have long-term plans.
 They weren’t asked for the right amount.
 They aren’t motivated by the cause.
 They haven’t been part of a culture of giving.
 They have compassion fatigue.
121
Chapter 7: Meeting Your Donor

What is compassion fatigue? In recent years, the term compassion fatigue has
been used to describe the situation in which the donor is bombarded and
overloaded with calls for help. This month it’s a hurricane; next month it’s a
wildfire. The food pantry needs help next, and the preschool for the develop-
mentally disabled may close its doors if you don’t help now.
Donors can be spread too thin, and when they are, they begin shutting off
their charitable involvements. For this reason, we try to not paint pictures
too black, needs too dire, or situations too insurmountable. Too bleak a situa-
tion can make the donor feel that the task at hand is too daunting and may
not be doable for her. Instead, you want donors to feel that they are part of a
winning team, working toward a thought-out effort, and supplying funds in an
area that is sure to bring relief to the clients who are being served.
You may find it hard to believe that one of the major reasons donors don’t
give is that they are never asked. But it’s true! Can you imagine visiting with a
donor, having several conversations, having lunch, and then not asking them
to make a donation? Rejection is a universal fear, and people everywhere try
to avoid it. Fundraisers often set up the conversation to lead to asking for a
major gift and then back off or chicken out. Why? Hinting for a gift is safer if
you are anticipating a No. (See Chapter 9 to read about how to ask the ask
directly and sidestep the whole rejection issue at the same time.)
Cultivating the Initial Relationship
As you continue to talk and get to know your potential donor, you are build-
ing trust and discovering where your shared ideals lie. If the situation is the
right one, by the end of the meeting you should plant the ideas that
 You value the donor’s involvement with your organization.
 You would like to involve them on a deeper level.
 You have ideas for helping them meet their estate goals and avoid exces-
sive taxation.
 You would like to write up a few ideas and meet with them in the 
coming weeks.
At this point, keep the trust building. At the end of your luncheon, you
want the donor leaving with a good feeling about you and her relationship
with your organization. So avoid the following when you are in this initial
relationship-building stage:
122
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

 Making assumptions: If the donors are in their 30s, you may assume that
they aren’t interested in an estate planning option — but you could be
missing an opportunity. Dan’s father died at 45, and he’s sensitive to the
issues involved with caring for one’s family long term in the event of an
untimely death. The key here is to listen, listen, listen to your donors,
and let them lead you to the gift area that is right for them.
 Being afraid to bargain down: When you are at a point where you are
ready to ask for a specific gift, don’t be afraid to ask for a lesser amount
if the donor rejects your initial amount. Generally, most people are flat-
tered that you considered them part of a group that could give the
amount you requested, so no harm done. If Dan says no to $10,000, don’t
be afraid to say, “Would you be more comfortable with $7,500, given
over three years?”
 Promising more than you can deliver: Some fundraisers get focused on
the goal and promise the moon to a donor in order to secure a gift. If
you’re one of those people, fight the temptation. Your every interaction
with your donor either builds credibility or detracts from it, and making
promises you can’t possibly keep only hurts your organization in the
long run.
 Being vague about how the money’s going to be used — not being spe-
cific: Today’s donor, having grown up in an age of media exposé, is
somewhat leery about how nonprofit organizations spend their contri-
butions. Be forthcoming with your information — it speaks volumes
about your credibility. And remember that even if you don’t want to
reveal information about the sources of your income and how it is used,
a ruling by the IRS makes it mandatory for you to make available to the
general public IRS Form 990 whenever it is requested.
 Forgetting to say thank you: How can something so simple be over-
looked? Easily — because organizations often focus on getting and not
on receiving. Recognizing your donor by saying thank you, sending a
card, making a phone call, or planning a luncheon needs to comprise
about 20 percent of your fundraising time. Seem like a lot of time? It’s
not if you recognize that your primary goal is building relationships with
your donors. “Thank you” are two of the best friendship-building words
in our language.
One way to recognize your donors and strengthen their relationships with
your organization is to get your donors together at a dinner or other social
gathering. One nonprofit we worked with held cocktail parties for people who
gave $5,000 or more. The receptions were a way of saying thank you — and
were very popular with the donors. During the evening, donors exchanged
ideas and information about the organization, such as why they gave, how
they became involved, and what they liked about it, which makes everybody
feel good about what they’re doing. Donors also often met people they
123
Chapter 7: Meeting Your Donor

admired in the community and felt that their choices were affirmed. The
internal message was, “Wow! I didn’t know she supported this organization!
This must be a great place!”
At such an evening for donors, the admired person’s involvement serves as a
kind of seal of approval for you, which translates into more passion in the
hearts and minds of the donors who attend the special evening for donors.
An even better twist to a donor recognition dinner is to get a sponsor to
underwrite the meal for you. You can have a box lunch or a format fete
brought in, rewarding your donors and giving visibility to your sponsor —
and it won’t come out of your budget! Everybody wins!

E
ach and every donor who has given to your organization in the past,
gives today, or will give tomorrow is important to the continuation of
your mission. The donor who gives substantially to your organization is one
of your primary stakeholders and is close enough to care in a big way. This
chapter takes a look at the special relationship you nurture with major givers
and helps you make sure that you’re acknowledging their gifts and commit-
ment appropriately.
Finding the Holy Grail of Fundraising —
The Major Gift
A major gift in your organization may be completely different than that in
another organization. The size of the major gift is related to the size of the
organization. For example, if your organization is a small charity, a gift of
$5,000 would be considered a major gift. But if your organization is a major
metropolitan orchestra, a gift of $5,000,000 would be considered a major gift.
(Okay, that would be a major gift for any organization!)
There is no hard-and-fast rule about what constitutes a major gift. What you
consider “major” depends on the average size of the gifts you receive, the size
of your annual budget, and your expectations and plans for future growth.

Planning your way to major gifts
When do you get major gifts? The most logical answer is “Anytime a donor
wants to give one!” But fundraisers often plan to secure major gifts when they
gear up for specific fundraising campaigns. A major gift often serves as the
very foundation of a campaign, ensuring the success of the campaign before
the organization launches it completely. For example:
 You’re planning a capital campaign where you need to determine how
many major gifts you need in each of several ranges to take you to your
goal. Creating a Gift Range Chart can help you determine this informa-
tion. (See Chapter 5 to find out how to create a Gift Range Chart.)
 You’re launching a new program and want to get major gifts from lead
givers to set an example for others.
 You ask a board member to donate a major gift as a “challenge grant” to
get other members to give.
 You’re building an endowment fund and plan to use major gift strategies
and planned giving opportunities to bring in those funds.
You have a major giving program even if you’re a small organization just
starting out because you need to cultivate low-level donors over time and
grow them into major donors. The normal progression of fundraising is to
bring the donor closer, which also means increasing the amount of giving
along the way. If you haven’t thought about your current giving program as
leading to major gifts, explore a new and profitable area!
Chapter 21 reviews the major gift process in more detail.
Reviving your pool of current donors 
Before you begin targeting major gifts you need make sure that your donor
list is current and active. Your organization already has a record of who has
given major gifts to your organization in the past. You need to find this infor-
mation and scour it. Who has given in the past and is still active in the organi-
zation today? Has anyone who has given before disappeared? If so, you can
follow up and try to find out why they are no longer active in your organiza-
tion. Maybe another contact from you is just what the donor needs to get
reinvolved in your organization.
After you find the information on gifts made to your organization, make a list
of all the major gifts your organization has received in the last three years.
Then for each gift listed, include information on what program the money
was targeted for (if any), the amount given, the terms of the gift (paid in one
year, over three years, and so on), and of course, the donor who gave the gift.
How have these gifts been used? What activity have these donors had since
126
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

they gave those gifts? These donors can still be active in your organization,
with the proper attention.
Of course, unforeseen things happen and sometimes organizations fall out of
favor with a donor for one reason or another. But being new to the position
gives you a great excuse — when you call you can say, “Mrs. Williams, I’m the
new development person at StreetReach, and I can see that you were very
active in 1997 and 1998, and your involvement really helped our organization.
I’m calling to introduce myself, thank you for what you did with us in the
past, and invite you back!”
Targeting your major gifts 
As we discuss in Chapter 5, one of the first steps in effective fundraising is to
know what your dollar goal is. You may be trying to raise $30,000 or $3,000,000
this year. If you plan to renovate your building, you have to figure the renova-
tion cost. If you need money for that music outreach program, you need to
determine how much. Before you make a solid plan for the how-when-where-
and-why of major gifts, you need to know the “how much” — as in how much
you need to raise.
After you know your dollar goal, you can create a Gift Range Chart to help
you determine the kind of major gifts you’re looking for and how many of
them you need.
Your fundraising plan — and the Gift Range Chart — won’t include all major
gifts. You will have several different major gift levels, such as $10,000, $5,000,
and $2,500 and also categories for lesser gifts. Not every giver makes the
same level of gift, of course, and some, given a choice and gentle encourage-
ment, may give a much higher amount than you expected!
Major corporations are, more and more, a good source of major gifts, so
much so that we dedicate an entire chapter to them. Go to Chapter 22 for
detailed information about soliciting corporate gifts.
Cultivating donors who have a lot to give
After you determine how many major gifts you need to reach your fundrais-
ing goal, you need to begin thinking about which donors can help get you
there. Where can you find major donors? The possibilities are endless! Here’s
a list of where you can begin to look:
 On your board
 On the boards of other organizations similar to your own
 In the community, making waves
127
Chapter 8: Cultivating Major Givers

 In the community, making headlines
 In the community, making money
 In the ranks of your volunteer corps
 On your donor list
What’s your best tool for finding major donors? Your donor list! With that in
mind, you really need an up-to-date, complete list that you use regularly. You
not only find out more about your donors (and make better use of the infor-
mation you already have), but also may find donors “popping out at you” that
you overlooked before. Review your list regularly!
Soliciting major gifts for human services organizations can be challenging
because human services are ongoing, dynamically changing services. For
human service organizations, one successful area for major gifts is in the
endowment area. In this case, the organization sets up an endowment fund to
produce an ongoing source of funds, which guarantees that the service will
continue for future generations. We cover endowments in Chapter 23.
Steps to cultivating major donors
The level closest to your organization involves those stakeholders, clients,
and board members who obviously share the mission of your organization.
(Read about the levels of giving in Chapter 6.) They care deeply about the
cause and the furthering of your mission. Those are the people who are also
going to be your highest-level donors, because their passion is in line with
your own.
But most major donors don’t simply start out being major donors. Often they
grow closer to your organization over time, perhaps starting out by making a
$25 donation to your annual fund and then gradually moving closer to the
heart of your organization. 
128
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
The major donor profile
If you’re not sure what your major donors will
be like, consider these common characteristics
that we find in our daily work:
 Major donors often are involved in a
number of community activities.
 Major donors have often already raised
their families (50s and up).
 Major donors often have at least some col-
lege education.
 Major donors may have volunteered as a
young person.
 Typically, major donors itemize their tax
returns.
 Major donors are often involved in religious
organizations.

The donors who give at a low level today are your major givers of tomorrow,
which means that cultivation — the art of enhancing and building the donor-
agency relationship — is not only good practice, it’s good business. Today’s
$25 donor may be tomorrow’s $25,000 donor.
The process of involving a donor at ever-increasing levels of giving is a logical
one, as we describe in Chapter 7:
1. Identify the donors you feel are good prospects for major gifts. 
• Review your donor list and give records. 
• Talk to board members.
• Research Who’s Who in your area of expertise.
• Use other research methods as needed (see Chapter 6 for more
about donor research). 
Make a sublist of your main list, showing only those prospects you want
to follow up on as potential major givers.
2. Research the prospective donors.
As you do your homework on the individuals, verify that their interests
do, in fact, support the type of work your organization does. Get a sense
of their giving interests, their other philanthropic activities, likes and
dislikes, preferences, and commitments.
3. Based on what you know about the donor, design a strategy for culti-
vating the relationship with him or her. 
Why type of program and/or sponsorship opportunity might the donor be
interested in? Would it be best to visit in person, invite the donor out for a
visit, or something else? The strategy you develop needs to be custom tai-
lored to the needs, interests, and priorities of each individual prospect.
4. Build, or cultivate, the relationship with the donor. 
Depending on the prospective donor, you may meet with her several
times over a period of months or contact her through a number of
means, such as phone, letter, or personal visit, and schedule the true
solicitation call only when you feel that she’s receptive.
5. Ask the prospect for the gift (better known as “The Ask,” detailed in
Chapter 9).
After you’ve cultivated the relationship with the prospect, you are in a
position to ask for the major gift. Remember that you can’t just jump
from Step 1 to Step 5. Even if your donor gives major gifts hand over fist,
the relationship building needs to come before the gift is offered and
needs to continue after you receive the gift, as well.
6. Express your thanks for the gift.
After you receive the major gift (we assume your solicitation is success-
ful), expressing your thanks guarantees that you get a repeat gift at some
129
Chapter 8: Cultivating Major Givers

point. If you say thank you graciously and remember — and honor —
any promises you make to the donor, you will have cultivated the donor-
agency relationship further. But if you neglect to express your thanks or
otherwise overlook the generosity of the gift, the donor will feel unap-
preciated, or worse, taken advantage of. You will not see any repeat gifts
from that donor in the months and years to come.
Recognize the size of the gift in a unique way appropriate to the gift. You
must honor each donor, so he or she knows that the gift and the patron-
age are truly appreciated, especially if your donors know each other and
are likely to compare your recognition efforts.
7. Account for how the gift is used.
What you do with the gift is as important to the donor as what you do to
get the gift. When you secure any gift — but especially a major gift — it
is vitally important that you do with it what you say that you will do.
The donor needs to see where her money goes, and you need to be will-
ing to provide that information as soon as the donor requests it, if not
before, which goes a long way toward building the donor-agency rela-
tionship and may ensure that you get another gift.
Because of some of the topics in the news today, such as stories about
charitable organizations using major portions of their gifts for adminis-
trative or overhead costs, many people turn a wary eye in the direction
of charitable giving.
Want to really impress your donors? Don’t wait for them to ask about what’s
happening. Go to them and say, “I wanted to show you what your gift is doing —
look how happy these kids are!” Show the donor photos of the programs she
has helped sponsor and let her see the fruits of her gift. Donors love to see
the outcome of their philanthropy — and the sooner you can provide that
information, the better.
Building a giving club
Although you may initially solicit major gifts for a program or campaign you
want to fund, you eventually should incorporate a major giving program as
part of your regular fundraising strategy. Colleges and universities have per-
fected the art of major giving programs by creating giving clubs. For example,
when you give a large gift to your alma mater, your name may be affixed to
the new library, to the endowed chair of a particular department, to a schol-
arship fund, or to any number of other long-lasting recognition opportunities.
Giving clubs actually serve a number of purposes. First, these clubs inform
your donors about the benefits they receive in each of the different giving
levels. Second, they help donors feel a part of something while building a sense
of identity for your organization. Third, they make it easy for you to show
donors how they can “upgrade” to a higher level of giving in subsequent years.
Begin a giving club by identifying the following:

Chapter 8: Cultivating Major Givers
More about why donors give
If you are a fundraiser, you are probably inter-
ested in what motivates people to give to
causes. A good place to start observing this is
with your own giving patterns. What has moti-
vated you when you’ve given to an organiza-
tion? Was it something in the organization’s
literature? Something the organization accom-
plished? Here are some common reasons why
people give to organizations:
 An acquaintance of the donor asked the
donor to give or volunteer (the #1 reason).
 She received services from the organization
or knew someone personally who did.
 She heard a news story or read an article in
the paper or online that alerted her to the
organization’s cause or need.
 She received an e-mail message from a
friend about the organization.
 She has a friend who volunteers at the
organization.

Does your agency have a gift that keeps on giving? Major givers like the idea
of an endowment because of the intriguing possibility of creating unlimited
funding for a continuing program (it keeps going . . . and going . . . and going).
People want their money to be used for something good, something that 
creates change for the better. For this reason, scholarship programs,
research for cures, and programs that battle the recognized ills of society,
like poverty, drug abuse, and illiteracy, are good candidates for major grants.
Who wouldn’t want to be able to say, “I gave the money that lead to a cure for
multiple sclerosis?”
Stroking Major Donors’ Egos 
As we say repeatedly (and we can’t really say it enough), giving is not just an
“I-give, you-get” transaction; it’s an equitable trade. What you’re trading is
your service to the donor for their involvement in your mission. Your organi-
zation receives something, to be sure, but you give something as well. Even
those donors who “give out of the goodness of their hearts,” not wanting any-
thing in return, need to receive some benefit in order to feel good about their
gifts. That benefit may be intangible, such as the good feeling that comes
from helping a cause you believe in. Or it may be something like a thank-you
note, call, or visit that says, “Your gift was very important to us.”
Treating your donors right
What do major givers want to receive in return for their gifts? For one thing,
they want personal contact with your organization. At the major giving level,
personal relationships become very important. Donors want to be sure that
you know who they are. They want to be recognized as higher-level participants
132
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
The special relationship with the high-end donor
In Chapter 7, you find out what motivates the
typical donor to give to an organization. With a
high-end donor, the relationship develops over
time. Many conversations take place about a
variety of topics, as well as about money and
your organization. The fundraiser needs to pro-
vide many contacts with the donor: letters,
e-mails, visits, and lunches, all in a variety of
forms and over a considerable length of time.
The donor grows steadily closer to what your
organization does, catching more of the passion
and feeling more ownership of the good work
being done. The donor also begins to think
about the possibility of a long-term relationship,
perhaps donating to your organization in a way
such that future generations may remember
what the organization meant to his or her family
and/or the community at large. This special
relationship takes time, patience, insight, and
cultivation. 

than the donors who send in the $25 check once a year to your annual fund.
The following list details some of the things major givers are looking for when
they give a major gift:
 Confidence in the board: Your major giver is more interested in the
makeup of your board than someone who gives at a lower level. If she
has confidence in the leadership and fiduciary responsibility of your
organization, the chairman, executive director, and other board mem-
bers, she feels better about making a sizeable contribution.
 The efficiency of the management: The major giver wants not only to
have confidence in the board but also some assurances that the organi-
zation is well run, efficient, and dedicated to fulfilling its mission. No one
wants to donate a large sum of hard-earned money to an agency that
may dry up and blow away next year.
 The credibility of any advisory board: Some organizations cultivate an
honorary or advisory board. Though these individuals don’t do much in
the way of legwork, their names on your letterhead can be impressive.
 Recognition: Some major givers — although not all — want recognition
from the organization, from the community, from their peers. 
Does your organization offer named giving opportunities for major
givers? If you have fountains, gardens, meeting rooms, or walkways, you
can develop a program where you name the item with a displayed
plaque when a donor provides the support for that item.
 Personal contact: We’ve already said this, but it bears saying again: Your
major giver wants to hear from you. Notes, calls, and visits all say to a
donor, “You’re important to us and we want to keep you informed about
what’s going on.” By giving at a high level, a major giver makes a signifi-
cant commitment to you, and he or she most likely expects an equal
commitment from your organization.
 Financial advice: Your major giver may want some professional assis-
tance before the gift is complete — from her lawyer, financial planner, or
a foundation executive. Have someone on your staff or board who can
speak knowledgeably about planned giving instruments and tax issues,
as a complement to, not a replacement for, the major giver’s own finan-
cial counsel.
Some community foundations are able to give donors tax and financial
advice when they consider major gifts. Check your area to find out about
workshops given by your local community foundation that may help
train development staff and/or your board on tax and financial issues.
 More bang for the buck: Often your major givers are business savvy
and like the idea that their money goes even farther than a simple gift.
For this reason, challenge grants are popular as major, or lead, gifts.
Your major giver may like the idea that the money she provides “starts
something” and grows into two, three, or four times her initial gift.
133
Chapter 8: Cultivating Major Givers

A challenge grant is a gift given to an organization that is contingent upon
the organization raising a matching amount from other sources. You may
approach a former board member for a major gift of $15,000, for example,
as a challenge grant. If the donor agrees, the organization can go to the
other board members (and to other major giver and funding sources, as
well), and say, “We have a $15,000 challenge grant, and we need to raise
the matching $15,000 by January 15 in order to get the grant. Would you
make a donation that would take us $5,000 closer to that goal?” (For more
information about challenge grants, see Chapter 21.)
 Family honor: Many families make major gifts not to secure recognition
for themselves but to memorialize a family member who had an affinity
for a particular group. Often these major gifts are made to endowment
campaigns with the idea that the endowment then provides an invest-
ment so that the organization receives dividends to secure its existence
in the future.
 A worthwhile cause: The donors of today are getting more and more
involved in investigating the charities they support and giving only
where they really want. This is even truer in the major gifts category.
Major givers are looking carefully for the cause that aligns with their
own concerns (which is another reason for you to have a well crafted,
timely, and up-to-date case statement!).
 Involvement in the community: Giving a major gift may put the donor in
a new social group or in a new light in a particular social group. If a
family is new to an area and has an affinity for a certain cause, giving a
major gift may help establish the family in that area as an advocate of
the arts, human services, or some other cause.
 Immortality: If your name is attached to the new library at your local uni-
versity, you don’t have to worry too much about whether you’ve made
your mark on the world. Many major givers have the desire — and the
means — to do something significant, to leave the world a better place
than they found it, to use their wealth to build a better future. The feeling
that you have changed the world for the better by being in it is something
most of us would like to experience at some point in our lives.
Peer-to-peer is the best way to approach a major giver. If Joe is the president
of a local bank, prepare and send a board member, who is similar in profes-
sional and social standing, your board president, or a company CEO. How do
you motivate the board member to do the soliciting? Have a board retreat
that focuses on approaching major givers and helps board members get com-
fortable with their fundraising roles. For more on dealing with your board,
see Chapter 4. For more about the nuts and bolts of asking for major gifts, see
Chapter 21.

Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

Providing donor recognition
Imagine that you are about to receive a major gift. Mr. X listened to your pres-
entation, liked your ideas, and is receptive to your suggestion that he donate
$20,000 over the next three years. You’re back at your desk, soaking up your
success. Enjoy the moment — for a moment. But then it’s time to ask your-
self, “Now what?” When you receive a major gift, or the promise of a major
gift, you want to acknowledge the donor right away.
Providing recognition to your major giver is as important as all the steps
you’ve taken leading up to the point of getting the major gift. Remember, this
transaction is about relationship, and you’ve just agreed to accept and be
accountable for Mr. X’s gift — and his involvement — over the next three
years. You have in effect said:
 “We value you — not just your money.”
 “We’ll use this donation wisely, as promised.”
 “We’ll be good stewards of this gift and be accountable to you for it.”
In addition to keeping promises you make to your donor, you need to recog-
nize your major giver in other ways, such as:
 Write a handwritten thank-you note on very nice stationary.
 Follow up by calling your donor.
 Make visits or have lunch with your donor periodically.
 Get your donor involved in high-level donor affairs, such as preview par-
ties, soirees, grand openings, open houses, and so on.
 Assign the donor to a board position or committee seat.
 Name a program, a building, a garden, or an evening after the donor.
 Invite your donor to focus groups where you discuss the future of the
organization.
 Send invitations to your donor for special events, such as seeing the
birth of a baby elephant, going backstage to meet a violin virtuoso, or
traveling with a select group to see a renowned speaker.
Sometimes, finding enough naming opportunities can be a challenge. One
group we work with found a solution by naming items in their office area, such
as the elevators, a meeting room, and so on, after particular donors. There’s
135
Chapter 8: Cultivating Major Givers

only one wrinkle here — what happens when the organization outgrows its
current building and moves to new offices? If the office has no elevator, the
development officer will have to come up with some creative alternatives to
protect the agency’s relationship with that donor.
Are you thinking of your organization’s major givers as prospects for your
planned giving program? If you aren’t, you should be! Start making that list.

If so, you’re not alone. It’s not unusual for people in fundraising, both experi-
enced and new, to dread the moment, that oh-so-frightening one-on-one con-
versation with the donor, when it’s time for “the Ask.” When you’re going
after a major gift, you eventually must face this terrifying moment. The stage
is set. The spotlight is on you. Your tongue feels like it’s the size of Nebraska,
and you hope the donor doesn’t notice that your shaking hands. This chapter
gives you a look at that terrifying moment and puts it in perspective with
some basic management techniques for recognizing and responding to the
challenges of asking for a major gift.
Keeping Focused on Your Mission
Who likes to ask for money? Nobody. It’s sometimes thought of as a “neces-
sary evil,” a part of fundraising that calls for the donor to “put his money
where his mouth is,” and the part of the process that for the fundraiser is
“The Big Show.”
Sure, people are hesitant to ask for money. Why? Two reasons: because
money is still one of the remaining taboo subjects (along with sex and reli-
gion) and because nobody wants to hear No. Hearing No feels like personal
rejection and causes embarrassment to some people. To some, hearing No

feels like a final mandate — a point of no return. To others, No can mean that
they’re one step closer to failure in a fundraising campaign.
We’d like to turn all those ideas on their head.
In truth, No doesn’t mean any of those things. The only meaning that No has
is the meaning that you give it.
Developing a fundraising system takes the work of many people for many
months. By the time you get to the point where you are ready to ask a poten-
tial donor for a major gift, you will have done considerable legwork and
research (see Chapter 6 for more about researching your donors).
Four tips help you stay focused on the work at hand (which is furthering the
mission of your organization — not getting bucks from rich folks):
 Remember what’s real. Money is an exchange mechanism, and you are
helping this donor participate in a charitable effort he or she cares about.
 Go for a Yes, but realize that you can live with a No. Expect that the
donor wants to make the donation, but remind yourself that Nos are not
personal and have more to do with the circumstances and mindset of
the donor than they do with anything you say or do.
 Think about the other person. It’s hard to go wrong in situations where
we fully devote ourselves to helping the other person. If the donor is
concerned about something, help him allay those concerns. If he doesn’t
think that it’s the right time for him to give, help him explore why and
see whether other options are possible. If you focus on the “getting,”
you’re going to feel as though you’ve lost something if you hear a No.
 Remember that a No may be a Not Yet. The donor-agency relationship
doesn’t end with a single No — don’t even entertain that thought. This
relationship is built over time and continues whether the donor makes
this particular gift. Keeping this in mind can help you remember what’s
important about what you’re doing — building the relationship and
matching the “right people” with the “right causes.” Timing is a major
part of the whole picture.
In this chapter, you find out how to listen to Nos with a different ear and to
recognize new possible outcomes of hearing a No. You also find out when to
“bargain down” and when to go back to base camp and regroup. We ask you
now to change your attitude that No is a word to be feared, and to consider
how a No can lead to a Yes.

Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

Checking Out Your Attitudes 
about Money
Before you can change your behavior you have to understand it. What does
money mean to you? Here’s a little true-or-false quiz you can take to see
which of these sayings about money are floating around in your head. Some
of them may be stopping you from confidently asking for major gifts before
you even pick up the phone.
True or False: Money is an 
exchange mechanism
True. Money provides a means of exchanging one thing for another. The
money exchange goes something like this: “I trade what I do for society with
what other people do for society.” We each have something valuable to give,
and we use money as the means of exchanging that valuable something. And
although alternatives to our current forms of currency have been debated for
some time, it beats carrying around a load of shells!
If you believe that money is an exchange mechanism, when you visit your
donor, you may find yourself thinking:
 “It sounds like we have just the program he’d be interested in supporting.”
 “I’m glad we’re able to help him do something good for the cause he
cares about.”
 “If he says, ‘No,’ I’ll see whether I can find an option he’s more comfort-
able with.”
This approach helps you to see the value in what you have to offer and what
your donor has to give.
139
Chapter 9: Asking for a Major Gift
Life’s greatest fears
What do people fear the most? Statistics show
that the top three greatest fears, in order, are
 Death
 Making a public speech
 Asking somebody for money
Are these your greatest fears, too? If so, it’s your
lucky day. In this book, we help you with two of
the three.

True or False: Money is the root of all evil
False. Money, being simply an exchange mechanism and not good or bad in
itself, can’t be the root of anything. (And besides, the real quote is “The love
of money is the root of all evil.”) People do bad things in the pursuit and pro-
tection of riches. You can’t blame money, though.
If you believe that money is the root of all evil, and you go to have that impor-
tant meeting with your donor, you may be thinking:
 “I wonder how he made his money, anyway — probably in some shady
business deal.”
 “She’s probably going to try to back me into a corner.”
 “I can’t wait to get out of here!”
No wonder you’re afraid to ask! Time to change your attitude about money
and begin to see it as a simple means of transferring things of value from one
person to another, and in your case, from one person to your worthwhile cause.
True or False: Money can’t buy happiness
True. Money can’t buy happiness, though you may sometimes wish it could.
It’s a common saying, however, and one we often use when we don’t have
quite as much money as we’d like, and we feel that riches are just outside our
grasp. “Oh well,” we sigh. “Money can’t buy happiness anyway.” If you go to
meet your donor with this on your mind, you may be more likely to hear
these thoughts in your head:
 “I’m glad I’m not her — she has to give money to make people like her!”
 “This whole thing about the haves and the have-nots really bothers me.
She should be giving more than she is!”
 “Why is she giving to us, anyway? Is she trying to buy her way onto the
board?”
Does it matter to you why your donor gives? It shouldn’t. You don’t want to
accept a gift you know to be unethical or illegal, of course, but because donors
give from so many different reasons — desire to help, self-aggrandizement,
recognition, status, and so on —it’s not your job to judge the giving that goes
on. Focus on the good your organization does and resist the temptation to
second-guess your donors’ motives.
140
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

True or False: Money talks
False. Money is an exchange mechanism. Unless you fold the check up, make
a little puppet out of it, and throw your voice, it is not going to talk.
But on some level, it is true that money can make things happen. Remember
the old E.F. Hutton ads? “When E.F. Hutton speaks,” whispers the narrator,
“people listen.” The idea, of course, is that money carries with it a certain
amount of power, clout, or prestige. People with money get things done.
People with money have access to things that others do not. These state-
ments are true in today’s social climate.
If you support the “money talks” belief, you may find yourself thinking these
kinds of thoughts during your donor visit:
 “I’ve heard that guys like this eat people like me for breakfast. What am I
doing here?”
 “He’s much more successful than I am. I can’t believe I’m going to ask
him for money!”
 “He’ll probably say, ‘No’ — I imagine he has refusals down to a science.”
As you consider your feelings and thoughts about money, we urge you to
remember that money itself has no power. Individuals who have fortunes 
to manage may (and probably do) belong to certain clubs in town, frequent
particular activities, and serve on selected boards. These people are real
people — people with friends, people with problems, people with causes they
care about and visions they’d like to see fulfilled. And these people, if their
interests align with the mission of your organization, can be great potential
donors — not because of the amount of power they wield, but because of the
access and perhaps endorsement they bring to your mission.
If you bring any preconception to dealing with wealthier people, a productive
one would be to guess that they respond well to businesslike reasons and
sound arguments for spending their money on your cause. All the more
reason to prepare well for your pitch, make it professional, and not waste
their time beating around the bush.
True or False: Money creates success
False. There have been incredibly well-funded failures as well as those that
have ended with the snap of their financial shoestring. What does create suc-
cess — personally or professionally, in fundraising or anywhere else — is 
141
Chapter 9: Asking for a Major Gift

passion, vision, focus, and perseverance. And if you ever find that bottled
anywhere, buy as many bottles as you can and sell them on eBay. After you
make your millions, you can be the high-level donor we all come to call on.
Donors who have achieved a certain level of wealth have arrived there
through any number of means. Perhaps they owned and sold successful busi-
nesses. Maybe they inherited. Maybe they won the lottery, won a lawsuit, or
saved quietly all their lives. In any event, don’t equate the acquisition of
wealth with great success or you may be thinking the following thoughts
instead of getting to know the interests of your donor:
 “He has so much money, he’s going to think that our organization is
pathetic.”
 “I’ll bet he’s way too busy to come to our donor luncheon. I won’t even
ask him.”
 “I wonder if he notices that I’m wearing shoes from Wal-Mart?”
Is the definition of money in the mind of the beholder? To some degree, yes.
People attach many things to money that don’t necessarily belong — power,
sex, influence, and social status are all part of the affluent image. To be most
effective as a fundraiser, free yourself of all definitions of money beyond that
which it truly is for your organization — an exchange mechanism that helps
caring people further causes they believe in.
Figuring Out Who Should Ask for Money
Long before you go on that donor visit in which you intend to solicit a dona-
tion, you should know who asks for your organization. Few things look more
unprofessional than a fundraising team, standing on that proverbial doorstep,
unsure about who is doing what:
“You wanna do the talking?”
“No, you go ahead.”
Finding and preparing the right person to do the asking is key in securing
major gifts. The right person ideally has the following characteristics:
 A peer-to-peer relationship with the prospective donor
 A giver
 Comfortable with fundraising
 Understands that the offer is something the donor wants
142
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

 A people person, able and willing to focus on building relationships with
donors over time
 Forthcoming and honest, willing to help donors resolve any questions or
concerns that may be keeping them from giving
 Confident and secure, unshaken by a “No” that could be a “Yes” down
the road
Perhaps the single biggest consideration in choosing the person who makes
“the Ask” is the question of peer-to-peer relationship. If you are approaching
the CEO of a corporation for a major gift, have your organization’s CEO or a
person on your board who is a peer in terms of social, economic, and profes-
sional status make “the Ask.” Another CEO doing “the Ask” makes things
much easier. Similarly, if you are approaching someone who has volunteered
for the organization for a long time, send another volunteer — not a paid staff
member. The similarity of the roles — whether those roles are professional,
social, experiential, or professional — helps build a sense of trust between
the donor and the fundraiser. People in unequal positions of power — a CEO
and a paid staff member, for example — often have trouble reaching the
“comfort zone” that people of like means or status share.
Teaming up for dollars
Some people prefer to work in fundraising teams, which are often comprised
of a paid staff member and a board member. The board member is tradition-
ally the one doing “the Ask,” and the staff member goes along for support and
encouragement. The problem with the two-person approach is that some
donors may feel “ganged up on” if they are put in the minority. For this reason,
you need to always be explicit about your intention to visit as a team: “Diana
has a brief presentation she’d like to show you about our new waterworks.
Would 2:30 be a convenient time for us to come by?”
But, on the flip side, two people can be helpful in fundraising calls because
 They can represent two different views of your organization.
 They give the donor a feeling that many people support the work.
 It’s more likely that no key points will be left out.
 If one person is having trouble establishing rapport with the donor, the
other person may hit it off.
 The second person may have expertise that complements the other’s.
143
Chapter 9: Asking for a Major Gift

Practice makes perfect. Even though your board members may be CEOs and
top-level community members, everybody can use a brush up on fundraising
skills. Before you begin an active campaign in which your board members are
soliciting gifts (or accompanying you on donor visits), reserve time to do
some role-playing. Have one member act as the potential donor and one
member act as the fundraiser — don’t make it too easy, and have fun!
In one of our role-playing sessions, the “donor” kept answering an invisible
phone on his invisible desk during the meeting. The fundraiser could barely
get a sentence out without an interruption. In the meeting, we laughed,
watching the “donor” frazzle the fundraiser. In the real world, we knew, all
kinds of interruptions and roadblocks happen in a fundraising call and the
better prepared you are for them, the better the outcome will be.

What do you think of the wealthy?
Just because you’re on the asking end of the
fundraising equation doesn’t mean that you’re
not wealthy yourself. In fact, peer-to-peer
fundraising, as you find out later in this chapter,
is the most effective means of approaching a
major donor for a donation. But exploring what
you think of people who have more money than
you do helps you expose and weed out any neg-
ative thoughts that you have (jealous or other-
wise) that may get in the way of effective
asking.
You can expose your hidden wealth prejudices

to mind:
“People with a lot of money are __________
________________.”
How do you fill in that blank? You may come up
with any number of things:
 Controlling
 Happy
 In a position to help others
 Lucky
 Miserly
 Open-hearted
 Powerful
 Power-hungry
 Successful
 Talented
 Unhappy
Think about whether your responses are largely
positive or negative; and if they’re negative,
change them. Perhaps you adopted your ideas
as you were growing up (many of our money
beliefs come from our early family experiences)
or as you struggled over your own financial hur-
dles. But whatever the source of your feelings,
recognize the ones that keep you from feeling
strong, sure, and direct in your fundraising
exchanges and get rid of them. Your fundraising
abilities — and your relationships with major
donors — will be better for it.

Flying solo
If you choose to go it alone on your fundraising calls, you have a number of
things working in your favor:
 You are the only one responsible for doing the preparation, which means
nothing (hopefully) will fall through the cracks.
 You have a good chance (assuming a peer-to-peer relationship) of reach-
ing a comfort zone with the donor on a one-to-one basis.
 You won’t feel that anyone is looking over your shoulder.
 You can go with your instincts to direct the flow of the conversation.
But, on the other hand, the amount of responsibility you carry on a solo visit
may be a bit heftier:
 You have to be careful what you promise —no one checks and balances
you but you.
 You can’t ask an informed third party how well you did in the call.
 You are relying on your own facts and figures, with no one to back you
up (so you’d better know your stuff!).
 It’s possible that the donor call may not go well, and nobody can help
you out of it but you.
One of the cardinal rules of fundraising is: You must be a giver yourself if
you’re going to ask for major gifts for your organization. Before awarding
grants, foundations want to know that the board is a 100-percent giving
board. This carries a lot of weight, and even if donors never know whether
you give or not (few people actually ask), you will know that you are asking
another person to do something you are willing to do yourself.
And your giving doesn’t have to be on the same level as the gift you’re asking
for, although it helps enormously with major gifts. If one CEO approaches
another and says, “I’d like you to join me in being a member of the Chamber
Society,” the message is that the asking CEO already gives at that high level,
and the other CEO is being asked to donate at the same level. This compari-
son serves as a kind of endorsement for the prospective donor, and if the
peer-to-peer relationship is such that the donor respects the asker, a natural
“Yes” is set up.

Chapter 9: Asking for a Major Gift

Getting Down the Mechanics of Asking
After you investigate some of your attitudes about money and consider who
is the best person in your organization to do the asking, you are ready to get
down to the nuts and bolts of “the Ask.” This section takes you through the
actual process and gives you the tools you need along the way.
Recognizing the equitable exchange
Picture this: You have a pair of concert tickets you are unable to use. You
decide to call a few friends to see if anyone else can use the tickets. You dial
the phone happily, feeling that kind of “I have something great for you!” feel-
ing. The first two friends you call say that they have other plans for the night,
but they are pleased that you thought of them; the third is thrilled and accepts
the tickets gratefully. After the concert, she calls and tells you all about it (it
was great, apparently), and wants to take you to lunch to thank you for think-
ing of her. You didn’t get to go to the concert, but you did get to be part of an
exchange that made another person happy. That can be a pretty good feeling.
Why does your role in fundraising have to be any different than that? Granted,
you are not giving away concert tickets (unless, of course, you work for a
symphony and are giving them to your high-level donors), but what you are
offering your donor is as important and as valued as a nice gift.
Fundraising isn’t just about getting money from people who have a surplus of
it. It’s about matching caring people with the organizations that support the
areas they care about, whether that’s music, art, human services, education,
civic affairs, or health.
Using the tools of the trade
Your fundraising starts with a toolkit. What do you need?
 Your mission and case statement
 Your donor tracking information
 Your budget and/or Gift Range Chart
 Materials for your presentation
 Pledge cards
146
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

If you still don’t have materials with your mission and case statement printed
on them, you’re not going to get much farther until you get those in hand.
You may be able to build a donor base through some word-of-mouth con-
tacts, volunteers, a Web site, and a newsletter, but you’re not going to get the
kind of high-level donors you want until you have something solid in print to
show (and leave with) the donor when you visit. Go to Chapter 10 for more
about creating fundraising printed materials.
Knowing thy donor
Do your homework! (This statement should go without saying, but well, we
said it in case you need the reminder.) Know the donor — well — before you
approach him. Consider the answers to the following questions as part of the
preparation for your donor visit:
 How long has this donor been giving to your organization?
 Why does he care about your cause?
 How much has he given in the past?
 How did his past donations help the clients who receive your services?
 What are his key interests?
 Which programs do you have that are aligned with his key interests?
 Have you prepared to ask for a donation in one of those key areas?
 How much are you asking him to contribute?
 What do you expect his concerns to be?
 How will you address those concerns?
We can’t say this enough: The more you know before you ask, the better
experience both you and your prospect will have, and the more likely it is
that your prospect will see the match between your mission and his. Check
out Chapter 6 for more about getting to know your donor.
Checking out each step of “the Ask”
Every process can be distilled, at some level, to a simple step-by-step proce-
dure. Use this procedure for “the Ask” as a general map for knowing where
the safe areas for conversation and comfort-building are:
147
Chapter 9: Asking for a Major Gift

1. Open: 3–5 minutes
You know about the introductions bit. As you’re walking in, you mention
the weather. She shows you the flowers from her garden. It’s been a
great year for zinnias, she says. You mention how great the irises looked
outside the conservatory this spring.
And that provides segue way into the next section of your conversation.
2. Engage: 5–20 minutes
“Have you ever been out to see the gardens in full bloom?”
“No,” says the donor.
“Oh, this year we included 14 new varieties of hybrids,” you continue,
which enables you to spotlight a few of the things you did with the
donor’s contributions to the Flower Fund last year.
The point is to truly engage the donor, to understand where she’s
coming from, to find out a bit more about her specific interests right
now. The engage enables you to see where her “hot buttons” are. For
example, if she comments, “I’ll never give to that group again if they’re
going to remodel their offices with my money!” — you know she’s not
interested in funding renovations. You also uncover any key interests
that may help you see how your mission and her interests match.
The most important three words to remember during this stage of the
visit are “Ask and listen!” Know what questions you want to ask ahead of
time, so you can get a good sense of what the donor wants to know more
about, what her concerns may be, and how you can resolve those con-
cerns. But most important, listen carefully. Watch her face; read her
body language; wait for the signs that she’s really excited about what
she’s talking about. When her eyebrows shoot up when you mention the
possibility of bringing in a well-known horticulturist to speak to a select
group at the conservatory, you know she’s interested. When you talk
about repaving the walks with real brick, her expressions seem to cool.
From that sensitive listening, you can begin to get a sense of which type
of gift would most engage the imagination and interest of the donor.
148
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
Focus group for donors: “Why do you give?”
When you prepare for a major giving campaign,
consider having a donor focus group to help you
discover why people give to your organization.
This may be something you already know, but it
is something worth revisiting from time to time. 
Get some of your active donors together — 
perhaps over a simple lunch. Ask, “Why do 
you give to our organization?” and capture the
answers you get. Most likely, you’ll get a wide
variety of reasons and you just may discover a
thing or two about your organization, and the
public’s view of your organization, that you
didn’t know.

3. Tell your story: 10–15 minutes
Now you’re in the groove. You’ve set the stage, found out about her pri-
mary interests, and discovered the angle that gives you the best chance
of appealing to her philanthropic interests. You now explain the program
or campaign you are here to talk about. You talk compellingly about the
need (which the donor should empathize with), and explain how your
program or organization serves that need in such a way that gets the
donor interested in being involved. During this time, you rely on the
information in your mission and case statement, perhaps handing her
brochures as you talk or showing her pictures of the possibilities or pro-
grams you are discussing.
During this period, don’t do all the talking; it’s important to stay alert to
clues from your donor that she has concerns or questions. Stop and
answer any questions she has. Be forthcoming and consider each
answer you give as a step toward bringing the donor into a better under-
standing of your organization.
4. Ask for involvement: 5–?? minutes
In sales terms, this last stage is called “the close.” Often, fundraisers are
reluctant to use sales terminology (this is not a sales job, after all); but
the result is the same: You need to ask the donor for a donation. Sooner
or later, it comes down to that all-important question.
You move right from your presentation to the close. “I can see that
you’re interested in our visiting horticulturist program — I must admit
that I thought that you’d be one of the people most excited about this
idea. We were hoping you would make a lead gift of $15,000 to start out
this new program. And, with your permission, we would like to name the
program after you and your husband, Joe, for all the important contribu-
tions you’ve made to the Garden and to the community in the last 40
years. Is this amount something you are comfortable with?”
You’ve brought it to a Yes or No response. If you get a No, don’t panic —
you still have some things to do (see “Moving Beyond ‘No’,” later in this
chapter.) If you get a Yes, hand the donor an elegant pen with which to
make out her check (or bring out that pledge card!).
As hard as it may be to remember, this donor visit isn’t about you or your
organization. It’s about your donor and how you can provide her the service
of contributing to a cause she cares about, which means that you need to
fight the temptation to monopolize the conversation, but instead sit back and
listen attentively. What is she really saying? What are her interests? How can
you best serve her? You best represent your organization when you truly
have the donor’s best interests at heart.
149
Chapter 9: Asking for a Major Gift

Moving Beyond “No”
Suppose that the worst happens and the donor says, “No.” Chances are you’re
not going to get a “No! And get out!” but rather something a little more gentle,
such as:
 “Not right now.”
 “I’ll think about it.”
 “I’ll have to think about it for a while.”
 “I don’t think that’s something I’m prepared to do right now.”
The most important thing to remember at this point is that in fundraising
you’re going to get all kinds of Nos and partial Nos. You should not give up at
this point and say, “Oh, okay. Well, thanks for your time.”
Instead, do a little investigating to discover the “why” behind the “No.” Here
are some questions you can ask:
 “Is there something that concerns you about whether this would be a
good use of your money?” Perhaps the donor still has some unresolved
concerns about your organization that you can clear up.
 “We were hoping you’d feel comfortable giving in the $10,000 to
$15,000 range, but it’s most important that you give a gift you’re
happy with. Would you like to divide that over three years, or make a
smaller gift? We’d be grateful to receive anything you are interested
in donating to our organization.” Maybe the amount is too large for the
donor to give in one gift. Don’t be afraid to “bargain down.”
 “Is there another time that would be better?” Perhaps this is the wrong
time for the donor to give. If the donor offers a time that would be better
for her, be sure to pencil in a time to meet again.
 “What can I do to help you say, ‘Yes’?” Whether you should ask this
question depends on the personality and mindset of the donor. Some
who don’t shy away from saying No directly may say with a wry smile,
“Nothing today — sorry.” But others who are more hesitant to slam the
door in your face may suggest something like, “Well, if I could be sure
that the funds were going to go to. . . .” If a donor gives you that kind of
response, you have something to work with in terms of furthering the
relationship and getting closer to the point where she feels comfortable
giving to your organization.
Is it ethical to mention other people in this donor’s social group who have
given to your organization? It may be ethical, but whether or not it’s a smart
thing to do depends on the donor. Some people are put off by what they hear
as “name dropping.” Others are encouraged when they hear that people 
they respect have given to your programs. Those people serve as a kind of
150
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 

endorsement for your organization. Test the waters by dropping a name or
two and observing how the listener responds. A cool reception means that
names don’t mean a thing to this person; an interested raising of the eye-
brows (or other body language) may mean that names could close the deal.
Rating Your Yes-Ability
If you do have a partner for your fundraising call, you have a built-in evalua-
tor. After you leave the donor, ask your partner, “How do you think that we
did?” Hopefully your partner will feel comfortable talking about the good —
and not-so-good — parts of the visit. You can find out valuable information
from the insights of another person who is at least partially objective. You
may want to ask this partner the following questions:
 “Did we seem well prepared?”
 “Do you think that we handled the question about last year’s shortage
the right way?”
 “Do you think that the donor felt comfortable with spreading the gift
over three years?”
 “Did you notice anything you think that we should work on?”
 “What aspect of the visit do you think that we did best?”
After you complete the call, you need to document the information in the
donor’s file. Write down the answers to the previous questions, as well as per-
tinent facts you need for fundraising calls in the future. Even if you received
the Big Gift, this relationship continues, as you see in the following section.
If the meeting didn’t go as planned, consider sending somebody else to call
on the person in a few months. You don’t want to leave a bad taste in the 
151
Chapter 9: Asking for a Major Gift
Dealing with the less-than-perfect call
Not all your calls will go the way you want them
to. You will have an occasional meeting when
somebody is put off by what you’re doing.
Remember one important rule: “Don’t worry
about it!” Then move on to your other
prospects. With the number of people you’re
going to see and the calls you’re going to make,
a few of the calls may not go well.
If you remember the big picture — what your
goals are — and know that a certain percent-
age of calls aren’t going to be perfect, you can
deal with the ups and downs that come with the
territory.

donor’s mouth about you or your organization if you want to maintain a long-
term relationship. Maybe another person would simply be a better fit with
the donor’s personality, or find the timing better down the road.
Following Up after “the Ask”
Finally, the call is over. You are driving back to your office with the nice feel-
ing of having a $15,000 check for your organization in your briefcase. Mrs.
Donor was very gracious and pleased that you approached her to give the
lead gift for your new program. She likes the idea of the program being
named after her family, and she wants to serve on the committee to help
organize the kickoff event.
What are your responsibilities toward Mrs. Donor now that she’s given her
gift? This is an ethical question you will be faced with over and over again in
fundraising.
Donors are not just money sources. They are people with interests and pas-
sions and troubles and fears. It’s not unusual to meet a major donor late in
his or her life who has lost a spouse, and he or she may want to spend time
talking, remembering, and visiting. When that donor writes you a major
check, you have an obligation to show the donor that your relationship is not
just about money. What kinds of things do you need to do to follow up after
the gift? Here are just a few ideas:
 The all-important thank-you note
 A follow-up phone call
 Information on the new program as it develops
 The newsletter or e-newsletter
 Invitations to all high-level social events
 Occasional lunches or visits
 Invitations to participate in focus groups and/or special engagements
 Invitations to get involved in other organizational events the donor may
be interested in
As we say repeatedly in this chapter, “the Ask” doesn’t have to be a panic-
inducing event. Even if you don’t get the answer you want, you can make this
a positive contribution to building the relationship between you and the
donor — which may lead to a “Yes” down the road.

W
hich pieces catch your eye and your imagination as you glance
quickly through the mailings you receive? Which ones do you throw
away? In this chapter, I show you how to perfect your printed materials —
both those you mail and those you hand deliver — so that you can make
sure that they are worth the cost of the paper you print them on, build
your organization’s identity, and draw the donor closer to your mission.
Using Print Pieces to Further Your Cause
Print pieces give your organization credibility and continue to speak for you
long after your meeting is over. Think about it: You go to visit a donor to talk
to her about a gift for your capital campaign. You walk in empty handed, and
sit and play with your hands while you talk. No matter how convincing your
presentation, without leaving something to show for it, the word pictures you
paint fade quickly from your donor’s mind. If you take a folder with the annual
report, the current newsletter, and a program brochure or two, your donor
has something to review — and remember — after you’ve left.

But printed pieces can also:
 Be mailed to donors you can’t visit face to face
 Keep donors informed and involved with your programs
 Reach new donors
 Build your organization’s identity when distributed in the community
 Be included in your corporate and foundation grant-proposal packages
 Reinforce the stability and credibility of your organization
Having printed materials also helps smooth an uncomfortable face-to-face
visit: When you show the donor interesting things in your annual report, you
shift her attention from you to the good work being done.
Updating Printed Materials
Chances are you won’t be creating all your printed pieces from scratch. Even
the smallest nonprofits have some kind of printed literature, though it may
only be a fact sheet or a case statement. Before you think about printing new
and/or improved materials, gather up what you already have. Taking a look at
what your current pieces say — and how they say it — can help you make
educated choices about what pieces you print this time around.
Use these questions to evaluate the materials you currently have and deter-
mine whether it’s time to make some changes:
 What kinds of pieces do you have?
 Which pieces do you use most?
 Does the printed information accurately convey your mission statement?
 Is the program information current?
 Are board member names up to date?
 Have you had any feedback from people outside the organization regard-
ing your publications? If so, take this into account as you plan revisions.
 Do you have a large stock of existing publications? How long do you
expect your current stock to last?
 What is your print materials budget? Do you need to make do for a while
and slowly add new materials as you can afford them?
Knowing what you have in stock and the quality of your publications can
help you plan when you need to reprint brochures, or give you a target date
to have a revision ready.
156
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Consider updating your printed materials for use on your Web site. That way
you leverage all the effort that went into the printed piece to easily provide
fresh content for your site.
Selecting the Right Print Pieces
Some organizations think that professionally printed pieces are luxuries —
something they can add after they have the basic fundraising system in place.
Although many on-a-shoestring nonprofits put off printing costly annual
reports, color brochures, and fancy engraved letterhead, you can still publish
less costly print pieces now, and save printing the “good stuff” until a time
when you can afford it more easily.
Saving money on printing
Here are some ideas on how you can save money on your printing:
 Decide what you really need. Perhaps a simple, conversational, direct
mail letter is what you want. Then you may not need a full-color
brochure. With strong content and good design, you can start with a
simple black-and-white piece. (The section, “Assembling the basics,”
later in this chapter, lists different types of pieces you may need.)
 Use a full-service copy shop. You can print at a full-service copy shop
rather than a print shop to start and still have nice print pieces.
 Do it yourself. Computers, graphic design software, and laser printers
have made print pieces easier and less costly than ever to produce in
small volume right in your own office.
 Try to get your printing donated. For example, can one of your board
members who is a business owner help? You may be able to align with
another organization, such as a local library, that can do your printing as
an in-kind contribution. Ask around, and be creative. Many large organi-
zations and companies in your area have their own printing resources
and may be willing to share their resources to help your cause.
157
Chapter 10: Printing for Profits: Direct Mail, Annual Reports, and More
How “nice” do we want to look?
Publishing documents that look too nice — that
is, with slick, four-color photos, stitched-in pock-
ets, and glossy covers — may be a bit too fancy
for a small startup nonprofit that deals with issues
of homelessness. The overall impression should
say to your donor, “We want you to see how your
gifts are making a difference, but we don’t want
to use too much money to show you that!”

Assembling the basics
As your organization grows and changes, you may want to consider creating
one or more of these printed materials, listed in general order of affordability:
 Direct mail letters enable you to reach out to new donors, renew exist-
ing donors, and focus on specific donor groups for targeted fundraising
programs. You might also use a one-page newsletter format as your
direct mail letter.
Have you caught the Internet craze? Direct e-mail and e-newsletters are a
new hot topic for fundraisers on the Web. We explore those ideas in
Chapter 16.
 Brochures help you get the word out about your organization, your pro-
grams, and your needs. You might have a general information brochure,
a membership brochure, an endowment brochure, a programs brochure,
and a planned giving brochure, among others. As a general rule, brochures
using standard paper sizes and traditional folds with only one color ink
are the least costly and can start you off well. If you plan to mail the
brochures, make sure to use a size that will fit in standard envelopes or
work as self-mailers to avoid adding costs.
 Pledge cards enable your donors to respond to your direct mail piece or
personal appeal by promising a specific donation, perhaps over a period
of time. You can easily have a set of pledge cards printed that fit in your
direct mail pieces, ‘tipped’ into your brochures (just like those annoying
cards that fall out of every magazine you buy), and folded in your
newsletters.
 Booklets can help you focus on a specific area of your programming.
Perhaps you are creating a history booklet, or a booklet of recipes from
your volunteer community, or a resource handbook for welfare-to-work
moms in your area. Booklets, printed with your logo, mission statement,
and contact information, help you spread the story about your organiza-
tion and introduce others to your cause. Again, you can create booklets
that are as simple or as fancy as you need and can afford.
 Newsletters are great tools for showing donors how their gifts are help-
ing you meet the goals of your organization and making your needs
known. This print piece also gives you a way to announce your upcom-
ing events. Best of all, you can recognize individual donors for their spe-
cial contributions of time, effort, or money and thus encourage others to
donate as well.
 Invitations to stakeholders need to be printed for any special event, be
it a chili cook-off or a black-tie affair. Invitations can be simple, including
only the event, date, time, and reply information, along with a simple
envelope showing your logo and return address.
158
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Although simple invitations work fine (and are most cost-effective) for
most events, for that special white-tie event that everyone looks forward
to during the year, don’t be afraid to pull out all the stops (if your budget
allows). Consult a printer in your area to get some ideas on how to make
your invitations memorable while staying within your price range. The
consultation is also an ideal opportunity to seek an in-kind contribution
from the printer, who may be willing to print your invitations at a
reduced rate or charge you only for the paper.
One other publication can be helpful in spreading your mission and encour-
aging support: The annual report, covered in the next section. Sometimes,
the annual report can be handled as a direct mail letter. The important point
is to account to your stakeholders by providing an overview of your year’s
activities.
Technology affords several cost-saving opportunities for print materials. Buy
invitation or brochure stock at your local office supply store with preprinted
graphic elements, and then print on that stock, using your laser printer. Use
document templates in software products such as Microsoft Word or Publisher
to easily generate self-mailing flyers or brochures, or business cards.
Showing yearly progress 
with an annual report
Everybody from Fortune 500 corporations to the tiniest nonprofit has them:
annual reports serve five very distinct purposes; they:
 Inform donors (and the community at large) about what you’ve been
doing with the money you’ve received (referred to as accountability).
 Connect leaders of the organization with the public through letters or
articles included in the report.
 Review the accomplishments of the past year.
 Thank the people who helped you reach your yearly goals.
 Announce goals for next year to tell donors your plans for using their
donated dollars in the year to come.
No hard-and-fast rule exists indicating what you must include in an annual
report. But your stakeholders expect to see:
 A letter from the board president
 Articles focusing on successes during the year
159
Chapter 10: Printing for Profits: Direct Mail, Annual Reports, and More

 Your mission statement
 Financial information
 A list of donors by amount or giving group
 A list of goals for the next year
A carefully timed year-end annual report should help remind donors of all the
good they did in the current year and encourage them to build on their gifts
in the coming year.
Discovering Direct Mail Basics
Direct mail has long been one of the most popular means of keeping donors
in touch with the happenings at organizations. With a simple piece of mail,
you can invite new donors to join your organization, tell existing donors what
a difference their gifts are making, provide important information about the
fiscal responsibility of your agency, and persuade donors to participate in
giving clubs, planned giving programs, or endowment campaigns.
Direct mail is only one means of nurturing the overall donor-agency 
relationship — and a fairly distanced option, at that — but, done effectively,
it can help you achieve a number of objectives. Direct mail may help you
 Acquire new donors
 Inform existing donors and other stakeholders
 Alert your constituency and allied organizations
 Educate your stakeholders
 Tell a story or anecdote about someone who benefits from your work
 Renew existing donors
 Upgrade donors to a higher giving level
 Discover planned giving prospects
 Bring in donations for your annual fund
Donor renewal refers to the process of contacting existing donors — they
were members of your museum last year, and it is time to renew their mem-
bership. These kinds of direct mail pieces are effective because
 The donors know what they are getting (they were members this
past year).
 They are in alignment with your mission.
 They already have a relationship with your organization.
160
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

When you offer a donor the convenience of renewing her membership through
the mail, if she has had a positive experience with your organization, she is
likely to renew. You also look businesslike and efficient, something donors like
to see in an organization that they’re investing their hard-earned dollars in.
Debunking direct mail myths
Many people have misconceptions about what direct mail can and can’t do.
In this section, we separate the facts from the fallacies.
Truth: Direct mail reaches a lot of people.
Depending on the size of your donor list (either the one you’ve been growing
yourself or one you’ve purchased from a list vendor), you can send out thou-
sands of appeals to a very wide audience. We don’t recommend this, however;
carefully selected, targeted mailings to prequalified donors (those donors who
are already giving or are highly likely to give to your organization because
they’ve demonstrated an interest in your cause or similar causes) are the
best use of direct mail dollars.
Fallacy: Direct mail is a great way to get a lot of new donors.
Although we often send direct mail to that group of donors and potential
donors who are “out there en masse,” don’t expect to get a great number of
new donors through a blind direct mail piece sent to large populations.
(You’ll most likely get a less than two percent response on “cold” direct mail
letters.) The most effective mailing is the one in which (1) you have a reason
to believe that the donor is or will be interested in your cause; (2) you know
that the donor has given in the past; (3) you are fairly certain the donor has
the ability to give.
Direct mail returns are higher if the person receiving the letter knows the
person who signs the letter. Why? Because somewhere in the recesses of
your donors’ upbringing, they were taught that it’s rude not to reply to
people they know.
Truth: Direct mail, done right, can keep your donors engaged.
A good direct mail letter lets your readers know what’s going on in your orga-
nization, directly communicates a need (or better yet, an exciting new pro-
gram), and invites them to participate.
Fallacy: You can cut down on the number of personal calls you need to make
by using direct mail.
Direct mail will never replace a personal fundraising visit. First, direct mail is
used to reach those donors with whom you have not yet established or are
161
Chapter 10: Printing for Profits: Direct Mail, Annual Reports, and More

still developing a basic relationship. Second, a higher-level donor (a person
who has some history with your organization who you might call on person-
ally or take to lunch) could very well be insulted by receiving a blanket direct
mail piece you send out to what might be perceived as “ordinary” donors.
Truth: Direct mail is an important fundraising tool.
Depending on the nature of your organization, direct mail can be a helpful part
of your annual fundraising drive. If you have membership possibilities, sell
season tickets to the theater or the symphony, or host an annual conference,
you can use direct mail to remind last year’s donors that it’s time to make that
annual commitment. If you are part of a human services organization, your
direct mail pieces may ask for funds to help feed the hungry or house the
homeless. No matter what your cause, direct mail reaches out to donors —
past, present, and future — to let them know in a succinct but passionate way
how they can best help your organization solve the problems it addresses.
Fallacy: Only national organizations need direct mail campaigns.
Even if you are a small local organization, direct mail can be an effective means
of reaching a target audience that you feel would be sympathetic to your cause.
If you are a child advocacy group, you can do a direct mailing to your city’s
family therapists, for example. Planned mailings can be effective in any locale if
they are going to the right people at the right time for the right reason.
Truth: Direct mail can be costly.
Direct mail ranges from a simple self-mailing letter to a letter-and-envelope to
all kinds of fancy folders or color brochures. If you add the cost of purchased
(or rented) mailing lists, you may add several hundred dollars to the printing
and production costs. Direct mail can be costly, but it doesn’t need to be. If
you keep the piece and printing of it simple, use your own list, have volun-
teers produce and stuff the mailing, and keep the postage down, you can do a
mailing that helps you reach your goals without breaking your budget.
Fallacy: The first thing you need to do in a fundraising plan is start with
direct mail.
Unless you are a new organization with a really novel approach, a unique mis-
sion, and a sure constituency, starting off your fundraising efforts with a direct
mail campaign is like shooting buckshot at a wall when you only want to flip
the light switch. First things first. As you develop a fundraising plan for your
new organization, begin with your board as we note in Chapter 4 and go from
there — working from those closest to the heart of your organization outward.
162
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

That way, you can build your donor list as you go along, which helps you
focus your mailings to prequalified donors by the time you’re ready to do a
direct mail campaign.
Direct mail often uses the name of someone well known — such as former
President Jimmy Carter and his wife who write direct mail appeals for Habitat
for Humanity. If you have a high-profile spokesperson, make the most of that;
even if you don’t, think of people in your area who would enhance the credi-
bility of the pieces you send out.
Using direct mail to strengthen 
the client-donor relationship
As we note in the preceding section, “Debunking direct mail myths,” direct mail
will never replace face-to-face contact with your major givers. Direct mail is a
tool that casts a big net and can bring in an abundance of relatively small gifts.
In contrast, the personal appeal — particularly a peer-to-peer request — can
bring in a large amount with a single contact.
Your overall goal with direct mail should be to draw donors closer toward
the heart of your organization, with the end goal of continually upgrading
them in their giving patterns until they reach the level of a major giver, when
possible. This takes time, and continual contact, of which direct mail is only
the beginning. Figure 10-1 illustrates the cast-a-big-net theory — that you
reach 70 percent of your donors through direct mail, 20 percent through per-
sonalized correspondence, and 10 percent through face-to-face contact.
E-mail — both personalized and bulk e-mail — is also making up an ever-
growing segment of donor-agency contacts. In fact, post 9-11 fears of anthrax
in regular mail drove many donors to online giving in a big way. When you con-
sider the minimum 80 cent cost of postage for direct mail versus 0 cent cost for
sending an e-mail, you can realize big savings and be nearly as effective.
Don’t forget the value of personal correspondence. A personal letter is some-
thing you write directly to a specific donor, with him or her in mind, which is
very different from a direct mail piece. Personal correspondence can thank
the donor for his involvement, introduce the donor to a new program, and
invite him to be one of the first people to help you offer your new services.
Personal correspondence enables the donor to feel valued for being the high-
level giver he is and encourages him to continue building his relationship
with your organization.
163
Chapter 10: Printing for Profits: Direct Mail, Annual Reports, and More

Understanding what direct 
mail can and can’t do
So what do you want to accomplish with your direct mail program? You prob-
ably have both far-reaching and piece-specific goals.
Far-reaching goals may be to
 Meet your annual fund goals
 Renew and upgrade existing donors
 Gather information to update your mailing lists
Use your direct mail appeal to update your mailing lists by including a check-
box asking, “Has your contact information changed?” Provide a few lines, so
donors can write in their new information, and then update the information
as soon as you receive the response. This helps you keep your list current,
which makes for a happier donor down the road.
As you plan your direct mail piece, it’s important to do a budget that deter-
mines how much each piece is going to cost you. Know how much you need
in donations in order to make the direct mail piece profitable. Where’s your
break-even point?

Specific goals for the direct mail piece may include
 Getting the direct mail piece into the hands of the right people (people
who are likely to give)
 Getting the donor to open the envelope
 Catching the donor’s attention, so she reads the piece all the way through
 Motivating her to respond to your appeal
If you’re a large group, the best way you can boost the response rate to your
direct mail pieces is to use intelligent lists. How can you target your mailings
to a specific group? If you are introducing a new program that teaches nutri-
tion to pregnant teens, for example, you may want to sort your list to find
donors who are female, have children, work in a specific field, make a certain
amount of money, and live in a certain area. Anything you can do to increase
the likelihood of response by finding out more about your stakeholders helps
you to both save money on your mailings and bring in more for your efforts.
165
Chapter 10: Printing for Profits: Direct Mail, Annual Reports, and More
The list! The list! The list!
Throughout this book, you hear us harp repeat-
edly on the importance of your donor list. Having
a current donor list — that includes all kinds of
different data, from city/state to marital status
to civic associations — gives you the means by
which to identify groupings for your direct mail
campaigns. Following we list a few examples of
subgroups you may want to target:
 Volunteers who helped with the Halloween
Ball last year
 Directors of nonprofit organizations
 Donors who give through a specific corpo-
rate giving program
 Consultants in a particular area
 Divorced fathers making over $50,000 a year
 All donors interested in pets
 Working moms who also volunteer
What happens when you do a particularly suc-
cessful mailing and one of your sister organiza-
tions wants to use your list? Is it ethical? Will
your donors be unhappy?
The best situation is one in which you have
asked your donors whether you have permis-
sion to provide their data to other agencies you
feel that they may be interested in. If a donor
says, “No,” you mark that item on their donor
card. If a donor says, “Yes,” it allows you to add
them to the so-called opt-in subgroup of people
who have given permission for their contact
information to be shared.

Stuffing the direct mail packet
When you’re ready to put your direct mail piece together, what should you
include? Let’s start from the outside and work our way in:
 The envelope: Use a good-quality envelope, part of your organization’s
stationery, if available. Don’t use window envelopes! Your donors may
feel that you are sending them a bill. If you use labels, make sure that
they are high quality labels — some really sophisticated labeling tech-
niques can produce nice-looking labels that don’t give the impersonal
feeling that misaligned, badly printed labels can.
Some organizations hand address special invitations and personal corre-
spondence. For special donors, this can be a nice touch, and if you have
the people power to hand address any mailing (just hand the stack of
envelopes around the office and get everybody to pitch in), your open
rate will soar.
 The letter: Write the letter in a friendly and earnest tone — telling spe-
cific stories of people your mission has helped. Some additional tips for
the letter:
• Many people read only the opening sentence and the P.S. Make
them count!
• Think carefully about who is going to sign the letter. Someone well
known or high up in the organization brings the most credibility.
• Think in terms of emotional appeal, but provide facts, too. A reader
may turn off if you hit him with too much emotion too quickly. Tell
the story of the need by giving the facts on how his donation can
help your organization meet that need.
• Keep the letter brief, to one page if possible. Use attachments if
you need to supply more details.
• Call for action in the letter, giving the donor a specific amount to
respond to (“Your gift of $75 will help feed a family of four for three
months!”).
 The pledge form: The pledge form is the actual response form the
donor fills out and returns to your organization along with her pledge or
donation. Be sure to include room for the donor to correct changed con-
tact information. Remember to include your organization’s name and
bulk mail number on the pledge cards if you want donors to send them
to you via return mail. To save money on the return postage you can get
a bulk mail permit by going to your local post office, requesting a bulk
mail application, and paying a small fee.
166
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

 The return envelope: Enclose a business reply envelope, marked with
your bulk mail designation (or prestamped), so the donor can respond
easily.
A number of nonprofits that rely heavily on direct mail techniques use
their bulk mail permit on the envelope but add a note, saying something
like, “Your first-class stamp here will help us feed another family!” (if the
organization raises funds to feed families). This can save the organiza-
tion mailing costs and give the donor yet another easy way to make a
difference.
Many nonprofit organizations use the services of mailing houses to carry out
their direct mail campaigns. You can find a third-party vendor to write, design,
produce, and mail the pieces you want your donors to receive. Is this a good
idea? That depends on (1) the nature of your organization; (2) the quality of
your vendor; and (3) the limitations of your budget. Going out-of-house for pro-
duction and mailing can result in a pretty hefty per-piece cost. But today you
can find more self-employed contractors offering desktop publishing services
that make it possible to get a professional look for a relatively low cost.
Mailing services can also be contracted out, but be sure to ask for and check
the references of any mailing house you consider. A botched mailing can result
in more than money lost — unhappy donors require extra doses of reassur-
ance after a bad experience with your organization.
Testing your direct mail piece
Test your direct mail piece before you send it. As you are developing the
piece — first at the idea stage, and then when you have a draft, and finally,
when the design is set and you are ready to print the piece — test the idea
with coworkers, your board, and focus groups of donors and volunteers. Ask
questions like these to get the ideas flowing:
 Would you open this envelope if it arrived in your mail today?
 Does the tone of the letter capture and hold your interest?
 Do you get a clear sense of the organization’s mission from this letter? Is
the case compelling?
 If you didn’t know anything about our organization, would you want to
know more after reading this piece?
 After reading this piece, how do you feel? Interested? Encouraged?
Discouraged? Motivated to do something?
167
Chapter 10: Printing for Profits: Direct Mail, Annual Reports, and More

 What do you think of the design of the piece? Is the letter easy to read
and inviting? Was the envelope easy to open?
 Does the piece look too expensive? Too cheap?
 Do you have any suggestions for ways to make this piece better?
The best response you can get from a direct mail piece is the one sent to
donors you know from a person they know. If you have each of the volun-
teers, staff members, and board members you have review the piece and
each take ten letters to send to friends (with their own personalized letter in
the envelope), you can dramatically improve your return (and also build
additional credibility for your organization with the contacted donors).
In general, people are impressed when you don’t overdo the number of mail-
ings. By coordinating to save mailing costs, using a single mailing to send
more than one communication, you show good stewardship of the donations
you receive. Of course, the trick is to be able to include several ideas in the
same mailing without diffusing the focus of your appeal.
Getting Tips for Effective Print Pieces
No matter what type of materials you create, there are a number of things
you can do to help capture and hold your readers’ attention. Follow these
tips to help create your support print pieces:
 Easy-to-read works. Your stakeholders are busy people — they want to be
able to see what you’re asking of them at a glance. Make everything you
produce easy to read and navigate. Use bold headlines that say what you
mean; leave plenty of space between sections, so the reader’s eye is drawn
naturally to the beginnings of sections. Add photos or graphics, where
applicable, to help give the reader’s eye a rest. And use bullet points —
those great line-by-line symbols that say, “Look at this!” — to help readers
move quickly among the most important pieces of information.
 State your mission. Your mission statement should be on everything,
from your membership flyer to your newsletter to your annual report. A
person new to your organization should be able to see quickly what
you’re all about. The best mission statements are short and to the point,
30 words or less, and clear enough that stakeholders can remember
your mission after they move on to other things.
 Honesty is the only policy. Do your current direct mail letters exag-
gerate? Do your readers get your letters and say, “Oh no, not again!”
Remember to represent the work you do, the people you serve, and the
need you have as honestly as possible. Passion sells, but facts endure.
You want your donors to give because they care, but not simply about
168
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

your current crisis. You want to encourage donors to enter into a rela-
tionship with you — which means giving over time — and a crisis appeal
that works today may only annoy the same donor tomorrow.
Crisis letters do work — the idea is to tie a time factor in with the request
for donations. But donors will turn off to a crisis appeal that comes time
after time. A better use of your publishing budget is to mix crisis appeals
with thank-you letters telling donors about the good that has been done
with their donations.
 Strive for quirky, creative mailings. Doing something differently may
get your mail, newsletter, or annual report looked at. Try a new color, a
new folding system, or a unique approach. One direct mail piece we
recently received had a picture of the Statue of Liberty with a sign hung
around her neck, saying “Will work for food!” We opened the thing just to
find out what the rest of the piece was about.
 Tell your donors where their money goes. Today’s donor is a smart,
educated donor, and she wants to know that the bulk of the donation
she gives you isn’t going right back into your printed materials plan —
or your donor lunches — or any other administrative cost. Include on
your mailings a note that explains what percentage of fundraising pro-
ceeds actually goes to the cause.
An even better idea is to add a small chart on your materials that shows
donors at a glance how their donations are spent.
 Plan the flow of printed pieces. Think carefully about your plan and the
donors you mail to when you decide how many mailings you want to
send out each year. Will you send a mailing for the annual campaign and
the capital campaign? Will you also publish an annual report and four
quarterly newsletters? And when will the personal correspondence go
out to your high-level donors? You don’t want to inundate your donors
with information, but you do want to keep your organization in front of
them. You don’t want to send a direct mail appeal every month to the
same donors — that may leave the donor feeling that her donation isn’t
doing any good and may, over time, burn out her interest. Think care-
fully about who your donors are and how often they would be receptive
to receiving mail or publications from your organization. You may want
to do a focus group on this, as well.
 Remember “the ask.” The basic fundraising letter describes the need,
explains the solution, and asks the reader — in a direct fashion — to
give a donation to help make the solution happen. Even in a newsletter,
you can include an ask by including a Wish List for in-kind donations, a
Sign Up! section, or a stapled-in envelope that enables donors to send
gifts as soon as they finish reading your piece. Timely asks, for example
at the end of the year when people are looking for deductions for their
income tax, bring in a healthy return.
169
Chapter 10: Printing for Profits: Direct Mail, Annual Reports, and More

 Enclose a return envelope and a pledge card. This goes along with the
idea that you want to make everything as easy as possible for the donor.
If you include a prestamped, preaddressed envelope and pledge or gift
card, all the donor needs to do is write the check, seal the envelope, and
mail it. Note that if you use a preprinted bulk mailing permit insignia you
don’t get charged unless the person returns the envelope.
 Keep it simple and elegant. Simplicity is a style that appeals to a broad
range of people. Think simple elegance when you are designing your let-
terhead, your brochures, and your pledge cards. Don’t make the design
busier than it needs to be — donors may not understand what you want
from them.
By simple, we mean choose one or two typefaces and stick to them
throughout the document — fight the impulse to litter your newsletter
with all the cool type fonts from your computer. Elegant includes any-
thing from the typeface itself to the headline style to the use of space
and the type of paper. When in doubt about the design and style of your
piece, ask a number of people to review your preliminary designs, and
ask them what they like and don’t like about the current look.
Of course, what “simple and elegant” means to you needs to be based on
your donor base. If you are a young organization that appeals to people
in their 20s and 30s, you may want a more contemporary, active look
than if you are creating a piece for a chamber orchestra with an average
donor age of around 50.
 Say, “Thank You!” Your newsletter and direct mail appeal (to repeat
donors) gives you a great opportunity to spotlight what is already being
done with the donations you receive — you can identify individual
donors and say a big in-print THANK YOU. People generally love to see
their names in print and get the added benefit of knowing other people
in their volunteer, peer, or donor group see it as well.
 Donor Honor Rolls. These listings can be found in the back of theater
programs and are helpful in donor recognition, but having a special men-
tion in a newsletter or on a Web site can really make a donor feel special.
Even with the explosion of the Internet age and the importance of face-to-face
contact, printed pieces still have a place in your fundraising plan. Although
the words you write will never replace the words you say in person, printed
materials, done well, can be the next best thing to being there.
Consider providing a link to PDF (Adobe Acrobat) versions of print pieces on
your Web site. People can read and print these out themselves, saving your
organization the cost of printing.
170
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Creating a Print Pieces Plan
If you are gearing up to do print pieces and direct mail for the first time,
begin your plan with the following tasks:
 Determine a budget for print pieces. You may already know that you
want to produce a brochure, for example, or you may simply be putting
money aside to develop some print pieces. Depending on your budget,
you may want to put the following bullet first. If you intend these for
direct mail, be sure to account for the mailing costs.
 Decide which types of pieces you want to produce. Consider the uses
of the various types of materials described earlier in this chapter (see,
“Assembling the basics,” earlier in this chapter) and determine what you
need to accomplish through your print piece. The point is to let your
need drive your decision making.
 Decide when in the year you want to produce pieces. For example, you
may want to start off the year with an annual report, giving details, inspi-
ration, and success stories from the year before, and then follow this
mailing (or use it in tandem with) your annual campaign appeal, which
you can do as a direct mail letter, asking existing donors to renew their
commitments (and hopefully give more). You may then want to produce
the first of your quarterly newsletters. And as you near your organiza-
tion’s big spring gala, you want to send out invitations, and then soon
after, it will be time for the next newsletter issue. You get the idea.
We find it helpful to design a printed materials calendar at the beginning of
the year (along with bid amounts from the contractors who will be doing the
design and production). A publishing plan for one year may look something
like Table 10-1.
171
Chapter 10: Printing for Profits: Direct Mail, Annual Reports, and More
Getting donation boxes out there
One print product you might get a great deal of
response to is a donation box. You see them at
the cash register in the hardware store and
drugstore. These little boxes sport your logo and
tell people at a glance what they are giving to.
Quarters pile up and the boxes cost very little.
The trick here is to get local stores to participate
and volunteers to clean out the boxes on a reg-
ular basis. If you can also place a stack of
brochures somewhere near the box to tell your
story more fully, all the better.

uppose that your project is about helping teens master new technologies.
You can find a grant out there somewhere with your name on it. Want to
expand the capacity of your shelter for homeless women? A foundation is out
there, right now, just waiting for you to ask for the money you need.
The world is an abundant place. Locating sources of funding is not the main
problem. Finding the right funder is.
From the federal government to small family foundations, awards are given 
to every cause imaginable — from education to arts to human services to
health and beyond.
This chapter tells you how to find and approach the people with the money
by writing and submitting grant proposals. And although the overall process
may sound simple (“They have the money, and we need it!”), every step of
the way requires careful thinking, planning, and writing. If you haven’t yet
thought through every bell and whistle your program offers — and how you
plan to pay for those bells and whistles — you find out here that you have
the opportunity to fill in all the blanks as you prepare your grant proposal.
This chapter also gives you both a broad-brush and a fine-point approach to
grant research and proposal writing. As you can see, we have much to say
about grant proposal writing and even more is out there for you to discover.

The best way to master grant proposal writing is to practice. Each time you
write one you’ll get a little better, a little clearer, a little more targeted. And,
we hope, you’ll get more than a little money as well.
Getting a Grip on What a Grant Is
At its most basic level, a grant is an award of money given to a charity or an
individual. If you look it up in the dictionary, you find one of the definitions to
be “a gift . . . for a particular purpose.” Nonprofit organizations receive grants
for a variety of purposes: to start or run programs, to build buildings, and to
build strategies. Grants have a common theme: generally, a grant is freely
given; you don’t have to repay it. One exception to the free grant theme
comes in the form of program-related investments, which are grants made by
foundations specifically for use in starting programs that fit the foundation’s
philanthropic agenda. You are required to repay these grants.
174
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 
Some grant-related definitions
Have you seen the ads for courses in grant 
writing? Somebody needs to tell these people
(okay, we’ll do it) that the person who applies for
the grant writes the grant proposal, not the
grant itself. The correct phrase is “writing the
grant proposal,” not “writing the grant.” Nobody
really writes the grant; the granting agency usu-
ally just writes a check.
A foundation is an institution founded through
an endowment and supported into the future
with that endowment. Foundations are tax free
and can award tax-free grants for specific phil-
anthropic purposes, should they choose to.
The grantor is the person/foundation/corpora-
tion who is awarding the grant.
The grantee or grant recipient is your organiza-
tion, if you are being awarded the grant.
A challenge grant is a grant award offered by a
person or foundation that is contingent on a
specified amount of money being raised from
other sources.
A block grant is a grant award usually given to
local or state governments to be divided among
agencies in a specific category.
A consortium grant is a grant award given to a
group of affiliated organizations for a collabora-
tive project.

Locating the Grant Givers
Grants can come from any number of sources. When you create your grant-
seeking program, think about which of these sources may be most likely to
“catch the spark” of your organization’s mission:
 Government agencies comprise a large percentage of the sources avail-
able for grant seekers.
 Private foundations award grants that are consistent with their own mis-
sion and interests. A great source for private foundations is Foundation
Reporter 2005 (available for a pricey $590 through the Taft Group [www.
galegroup.com] or on the shelf at your local philanthropic library).
Foundation Center libraries exist in each of the following major cities:
Atlanta, Cleveland, New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.
Cooperating collections that can obtain publications on loan are avail-
able in just about every state. If you do not have one of these libraries
near you, check out http://fdncenter.org/collections/index.html
to find a list of cooperating Foundation Center collections in your state,
or use the online subscription service to enable you to search a library
online from the comfort of your office or home.
 Corporate foundations give grant awards to charitable organizations
that seek funds in their areas of focus. The corporate foundation is often
driven by employee interest and focuses on funding programs in areas
where the corporation has a presence.
 Family foundations are foundations organized and managed by family
members, a board of director, or a trustee. Grants are made in accor-
dance with the mission of the family foundation.
 Community foundations, which make up the fastest growing group of
foundations, are local foundations set up to make grants for community-
serving programs and projects.
Finding the Right Project to Get Funded
What kinds of projects can you get funded? Part of the answer to that ques-
tion depends on the funder you approach. Different grant makers are open to
different types of programs, which is another reason you need to research
your potential donors carefully before making that first contact. Following we
list some general categories for which grant makers award grants.
175
Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals

Seed money
Everybody loves a great idea, and because of that, getting seed money — that
startup funding you need in order to launch that new program, extend your
adult day-care program, or host this year’s job fair — is the easiest of grant
types to get funded.
As you begin to research and approach foundations, you may grow accus-
tomed to seeing the phrase no operating support, which means don’t even try
approaching the foundation for funds to continue the good work you are
doing. Although foundations provide seed money and capital grants with a
fairly open hand, only 19 percent of all foundations were willing to give to
operating expenses in 2002, according to Foundation News and Commentary,
the magazine of the Council on Foundations (www.cof.org). This was actu-
ally a four percent increase over the 1997 survey, but still doesn’t represent a
majority of giving by any means.
Why are foundations unwilling to support the good work they are willing to
fund at startup? We have a number of possible responses to that question,
but the predominant thought is that foundations like to “see” the good they
do. For example, if you have a new program that the funding enables, or if
you create a new computer lab in your school with the grant award, the foun-
dation can see where its money went and get a positive sense of carrying out
its own mission.
Program funds
Program funding may be slightly different from seed money in that you can
often get a grant award to continue an existing program if you are trying new
things. Mother’s Helper, for example, is a small nonprofit organization that
helps teen mothers continue their education while learning about basic par-
enting skills. Mother’s Helper is planning to add a mentoring component to
the program that will require additional volunteer solicitation and training,
marketing costs, and so on. The development person who writes the grant
proposal at Mother’s Helper will address this new component in her proposal.
Foundations favor the possibility of replication, which means that if a founda-
tion funds your program, it wants to know if your program can be repeated in
other areas as well. If it can fund one program and watch the good spread to
many places, it is more likely to show an interest in your program and the
possibilities it presents.

Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Capital campaigns
Capital campaigns fund new buildings. Capital funding is another area that
enables funders to see the good that’s being done in a concrete way (pun
intended). Capital campaigns enable funders (and donors, and your board) to
create something from nothing. From an idea, to a plan, to a model, to a real-
ity, the capital campaign gives funders the opportunity to participate in a big
way, creating the future of the organization and perhaps realizing an impor-
tant naming opportunity for themselves.
It’s tough to raise money for a building that’s already built. Recently, a museum
erected a new structure. The building is exquisite; the city was pleased. But
when the organization began raising money to help pay for the already-built
building, the general response was, “Well, you obviously didn’t need our money
to get it built!” Better to let people in on the opportunity to help when the build-
ing is still a dream — then everyone can share in the excitement as the plans
progress. You can attract a lot more investment — financial and otherwise — if
you allow your donors to participate in the process as it unfolds than if you go
to them after the fact and ask them to pay for this really great thing that already
happened without them. (For more info on capital campaigns, see Chapter 20.)
Laying the Groundwork 
for Grant Seeking
If you have never prepared a grant proposal, you have a wide-open — and
exciting — field before you. If you (or your organization) have been applying
177
Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals
Grants: Just one piece of the fundraising puzzle
The hallmark of your fundraising program is its
staying power. Although your good ideas may
touch many lives and improve conditions for
your community, if you don’t address the eco-
nomic factors that enable the organization to
sustain itself over time, your mission will always
be dependent on that One Big Grant to keep it
alive another year.
Staying power is one of the best reasons to see
your various fundraising efforts as an interrelated
whole. If your donor base is strong, your list is 
up-to-date, and you are continually cultivating
major donors; and if you run a successful annual
campaign every year, use your resources, and
build relationships with individuals, corporations,
and foundations; then you can reap the income
you need for operating expenses from the results
of your healthy fundraising system. Grant
awards, then, can give you the working capital
you need to be creative, to launch new programs,
to try new things, to build on the solid foundation
of your other mission-related activities.

for and receiving grants, you have a track record you can review, revise, 
and reuse.
As you prepare to build a grant-seeking program, you need to consider sev-
eral key ideas:
 Is your board ready to begin a grant-seeking program?
 Do you have leadership in place for your grant-seeking program?
 Have you developed a strategy for grant submissions?
 Are you set up to administer grants monies and report back to the
grantor on their use?
Although it is possible — and sometimes by a fluke profitable — to apply for
grants haphazardly, your efforts pay off better when you develop a strategy
for your grant seeking. You find out how to strategize in the section,
“Developing a grant proposal writing strategy,” later in this chapter.
Getting your board primed
In all facets of fundraising, board readiness is important. In Chapter 4, the
board carries the banner, safeguards the mission, and addresses the legal and
governance issues. The board may also give you many of your best leads for
high-level donors, contacts, and yes, even foundations.
If your board has been participating in the other aspects of fundraising, from
brainstorming potential contacts to going on important donor calls, working
on grant seeking will be a natural next step. How can your board help with
your grant program? The board can
 Help you test the viability of your case statement
 Plan your grant-seeking strategy
 Identify areas and/or programs that are candidates for grant funding
 Name foundations where they have a personal relationship or contact
Ideally, your board has a development committee that manages all the fund-
raising efforts you maintain throughout the year. The chairperson of this
committee should be a creative, outgoing, always-thinking individual — the
one in the room with a million ideas and no time to act on them. The person
leading your grant-seeking program also needs to be able to make associa-
tions and enjoy a good puzzle, because that’s what finding the right funder at
the right time and approaching the funder in the right way with the right pro-
posal is all about — fitting pieces of a puzzle together in a way that can be
extremely rewarding.
178
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Putting leadership into place
Should your development committee chairperson lead your grant-seeking
program? Not necessarily.
Depending on the number of fundraising efforts you maintain at any one time,
the chairperson’s time and talents may be better spent overseeing all the
fundraising functions, which means that, on a six-person development com-
mittee, you might have
 One person overseeing the annual fund
 Another person on the capital campaign
 One person looking into starting an endowment campaign
 Another person taking care of special events
 Someone else watching over the donor list and Web site
 You yourself in charge of designing and implementing the grant-seeking
program
Do you need a staff? Some nonprofits have huge boards with multiple sub-
committees, a full development staff, and an army of volunteers; other non-
profits have a small board, no paid staff, and few volunteers. If you are a
one-person development shop (and you are paid or unpaid), you need to
push your board to provide good leadership for your grant-seeking program
(and your other fundraising functions as well).
Even if you have few resources, your board leadership should be willing to
help you (1) identify grant possibilities; (2) gather the information you need;
(3) locate potential funders, opening doors when necessary; and (4) provide
the input you need to complete the grant application and submit the pro-
posal. And having good leadership for your grant-seeking program is impor-
tant for another reason, too: Any foundation thinking about funding your
good work wants to see evidence that you have strong leadership from the
board before it writes the check.
Developing a grant proposal 
writing strategy
What should your grant-seeking strategy look like? The grant portion of your
fundraising efforts needs to be a part of the strategic whole. During different
portions of your year (depending also on the time and people resources you
have available), you need to focus on different aspects of the search. Figure
11-1 gives you an idea of a yearlong fundraising strategy and points out just
where grant seeking fits in.
179
Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals

The strategic plan illustrated in Figure 11-1 is just one example we developed
with a small nonprofit agency that was organizing its fundraising efforts for the
first time. The idea is to focus energies in multiple fundraising areas — not
concentrate on one at the exclusion of the others. In Figure 11-1, the nonprofit
organization plans to focus on foundation donors from November to February
and on corporate donors from March to June.
Notice in the figure that “Building the Donor Base” appears in the center of
the figure because it’s central to all fundraising activities. You must continue
to contact and cultivate donors throughout the year, no matter how many
other fundraising activities are going on. Remember, the donor-agency rela-
tionship is central to the health of your organization and the fulfillment of
your mission. Although earning grants is an important part of fundraising, it
can never replace face-to-face visits and donor contact.
As you begin to plan your grant-seeking strategy, keep the following things 
in mind:
 Get help. You can get help researching and even writing grant propos-
als. Your board members, your volunteers, or independent consultants
and grant proposal writers can all help find prospects, draft the pro-
posal, and assemble the necessary documents. For this reason, you may
want to consider doing your grant research at a time when you have
plenty of help available.

Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

As you begin to research funders, realize that many of them have dead-
lines once or twice a year. As you identify the funders in your particular
categories, discover the best times to apply to those funders and plan
your grant strategies accordingly.
 Get training. A class can provide the instant how-to a new grant pro-
posal writer needs. Grant proposal writing classes are often available
through local community foundations, donor’s groups, colleges, and
online. You may want to find a class for your grant proposal writer to
attend just before your grant-seeking phase begins in your fundraising
calendar; then any work done in class can actually form the basis of a
draft of your real grant proposal.
 Get a database. No matter how much data you uncover, you need to do
something effective with it, or it won’t take you closer to your goal. Make
sure that your donor list is in good shape and that you set up a database
in which to record foundation information. Enter the names of contacts,
accurate deadlines, application procedures, and so on.
 Get a case. In Chapter 3, we discuss about the importance of your case
statement — the document you create that helps your donor catch the
spark of your mission. Nowhere in fundraising is the case more impor-
tant than in your grant proposals. The case needs to be clear, well writ-
ten, and current.
If you wrote the case statement five years ago and you simply repackage it
for this year’s grant proposals, maybe it’s time to get a new case statement.
We recommend writing a new case statement each time you do a new grant
proposal — not from scratch, certainly, but with enough new material that
the proposal reads like a fresh story with interest and impact.
The grant-seeking strategy you create is just a kind of ballpark road map for
your fundraising plan. Throughout the year, you may hear about new grants
being offered by ABC or XYZ Foundation, and you’re not going to skip applying
just because it doesn’t fall into the grant-seeking time you scheduled! You need
to take advantage of any grant possibilities that come to your attention —
especially if they look like a good fit. As a general rule, though, planning time
to focus on building your grant program helps you concentrate your energies
where they are most effective. And even though your grant-seeking program
may, in reality, look much different from the ideal one you draft at the start,
having a plan gives you something to get the ball rolling.
Looking at the grant process, step by step
Your board is ready to apply for grants, and you have the leadership and
strategy in place. What’s next? To answer that, you need to understand the
basic process of applying for a grant, which works like this:
181
Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals

1. Identify a need for which you want grant funding.
2. Begin to develop the idea into grant proposal form.
3. Research grantors to see which ones support the type of issue that you
are addressing. (See, “Doing Your Homework,” later is this chapter.)
4. Get current application guidelines from the grantor.
5. Write the grant proposal following the guidelines and assemble all
support materials.
6. Submit the grant.
7. Respond to any further requirements the grantor may have.
8. Get the grant award!
9. Submit any follow-up reports required by the foundation explaining
how the monies were spent.
Okay, so hopefully the grant process works like that. We may as well say it
now: not every one of your proposals will be funded. That doesn’t mean that
(1) the funder is mean; (2) your proposal was bad; or (3) your cause isn’t
worthy. Often it means that the proposal isn’t the right fit for the funder’s cur-
rent focus. Or it’s too late in the year. Or the proposal didn’t get to the right
person . . . or any number of other things. What do you do when you don’t
get the grant? (We cover the “Nos” later, in the section, “Putting a Positive
Spin on ‘No.’”)
Doing Your Homework
Where do you find all these foundations that are willing to fund your great
program? You look for them at the store, online, at the library, at the theatre,
and in the coffee shop.
Sound implausible? It’s not.
Starting your search
As you become aware of who funds what, you start to see names everywhere.
The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation funds a number of public
television programs. All you have to do is watch a local PBS station to hear
the name of the foundation mentioned. Likewise, you hear about United Way
agencies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as well. When you go to the
zoo, you can see names of high-level donors, including some foundations,
etched on plaques, drinking fountains, and benches. When you go to the store,
182
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

you may see Target or Wal-Mart on information placards by the register tout-
ing their corporate giving program. As you begin to think about where to start
your foundation research, remember the following:
 Keep your eyes open. You can see names of local and national founda-
tions on all kinds of things from special event to raffle tickets.
 Go to the library. If you can get to your local Foundation Center library,
great! The Foundation Reporter 2005 is a terrific resource for information
on foundations near and far.
 Check out your local donor’s alliance group. Every state has a donor’s
alliance group of some sort. Contact your local chamber of commerce to
find out the name and number of the donor’s group nearest you.
 Research your sister organizations. Who else does what you do? What
kind of grant funding do they receive, and from whom?
The best place to start looking is right at your own desk, carefully reading a
copy of the newspaper and, especially, your local business journal, as well as
visiting fundraising Web sites. You can pick up on which local foundations are
making grants and what types of projects they are funding. And don’t just
check these sources now and then — you need to keep your eyes on the
changing nonprofit environment every day. By reading your local business
journal or visiting your chamber of commerce’s Web site, you find out a lot
about the exchange of money and influence in your city or town.
Zooming in on your fundraising category
Suppose that you’re on the game show Jeopardy:
“Categories for $100, Alex!”
“ . . . Where one would look for grants for a local theatre.”
“What is, Arts & Humanities?”
“You got it!”
When you begin using foundation and corporation reference books, you
quickly realize that grants are awarded in different categories. This categori-
zation helps foundations control the types of grant proposals they receive
and helps you determine how likely it is that a given foundation will fund
your particular proposal. You will see the following nonprofit categories on
grant application literature and foundation references:
 Arts & Humanities
 Civic & Public Affairs
183
Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals

 Education
 Health
 Religion
 Environment
 Science
 Social Services
 International
After you identify which category your organization belongs to (and you may
be able to be creative about fitting into more than one), you can search for
the funders who grant awards in your category.
The preceding list isn’t the only way of categorizing organizations. The
National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) has devised a categorization
system that includes 26 different groups under 10 broad categories. You can
find this taxonomy on the Urban Institute’s National Center for Charitable
Statistics Web site at http://nccs.urban.org/ntee-cc/.
Consider a few examples to see how a little creative thinking can help you
target your search for the right grantor:
Example #1: The Private School
Christ the King is a Catholic elementary school with students in grades kinder-
garten through eight. The school is currently putting together a grant proposal
to enable them to rewire the electricity in the school so that they can add the
necessary equipment for Internet capability and telecommunications.
Sue is the mother of a third-grader and the volunteer in charge of grant
research. As she begins her search, she considers
 The local parish
 The archdiocese
 The parents’ group
 Local foundations
 Corporations near the school that support education
 Private foundations
As she researches foundations, she looks for funders who award grants in
 Education
 Religion
184
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Example #2: The Local Theater Group
The Phoenix Theatre prides itself on doing “cutting-edge” theater with a social
conscience, often bringing in plays that stimulate discussion on a variety of
challenging issues. As part of a play’s normal run, the Phoenix hosts a sympo-
sium with the playwright and any agencies in the area that serve a need that
the play illustrates. One play last year, for example, dealt with the issue of
domestic violence, and the symposium included volunteers from the human
services community that could speak professionally about those issues.
As Brenda, the development person, begins her search for funding of these
symposia, she tries
 The local arts council
 Business groups and professional associations
 Community foundations
 Local foundations
 Corporations near the theater that support the arts
 The state arts commission
 Private foundations
 The National Endowment for the Arts
The categories her programs fit into include
 Arts & Humanities
 Social Services
 Other categories, depending on the program and focus of the funding.
For example, in a symposium on the importance of family support for
hospice care, the Phoenix might approach a funder with a history for
supporting Wellness programs in the Health category.
Using local sources first
Although grant sources abound all over the globe — and they do — your best
bet is to start with those closest to home. Sources right in your area are likely
to fund you simply because you’re local. How do you find the ones closest to
your neck of the woods?
Start with the following local sources:
 Community foundations
 Local private foundations
185
Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals

 Organizations associated with the services you provide
 Local corporations and corporate foundations, especially those near the
site where you provide service
A little bit of sleuthing can go a long way. Prepare to spend as much or more
time educating yourself about your local funders as you do researching and
writing your proposal. A good fit is half the battle: You can have the best-
written, most exciting proposal in the world; but if you miss the deadline or
submit to a foundation that doesn’t support your type of mission, you are
going to come away empty handed.
Remember the importance of face-to-face meetings with major givers. Personal
meetings can make a difference with foundations, as well. When you have
researched a foundation and found a local funder that’s a good possibility for
your program, find out whether the director is open to an in-person meeting.
(Often, the funder publishes in its grant guidelines or in the foundation refer-
ence books whether it accepts personal meetings as an inquiry method.)
Relationship building is at the base of successful fundraising, and if you’re
willing to build that relationship with your local funder, it can enhance your
chances of getting that grant — if not today, then in the future.
Don’t feel that you need to hang out at your local newsstand or spend entire
days at the library doing your research for local possibilities: Check the Web
first. Many community foundations, business journals, and corporate founda-
tions are available online. Some even have grant applications and guidelines
you can download on the spot.
Working your way away from home
What happens when you exhaust your local fundraising options? Suppose
that you received a grant for $10,000 from the XYZ Foundation to provide
seed money for a job-training program your organization is starting for teens.
Congratulations! After you celebrate, you realize that you’re $15,000 short of
your goal. What’s the next step in your grant-seeking plan?
Use the XYZ grant to leverage other grants. Getting any grant at all — regardless
of the size or the source — is a seal of approval for other funders. The fact
that you have secured funding is an encouraging sign to those who may con-
sider funding you in the future. Getting funded means that somebody thought
that your organization was worth investing in.
The next step is to research foundations not found locally and corporations
that are similar in mission to the XYZ Foundation. Review your proposal, and
revise it to mention the money you’re getting from the XYZ grant. Then make
that trip to your nearest Foundation Center library. Get your hands on one of
the foundation reference books (see the list in the sidebar, “Resources for
grant research”) and begin your search for foundations that are a good match
for the program or project you seek to fund.
186
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

On the Foundation Center Web site you can use the Foundation Finder search-
able database to find good foundation matches. You pay a small subscription
fee, but the ease of searching the information online is well worth it.
Surfing the Net for grant opportunities
Most grant makers have Web sites. In many cases, you can find not only the
mission of the foundation online, but you can also print or download the
application guidelines and maybe even the application as well. You can find
all kinds of information to help you — including recent grant awards, grant
categories, the foundation’s grant-making strategies, and so on.
Figure 11-2 shows the Grants.gov Web site that provides information about all
federal grant programs. Notice that, toward the top right of the Web page,
you see a link to apply for grants. Here you can download complete guide-
lines and application materials for a variety of grants.
Why use the Internet? It’s fast, and even better, it’s current. Consider the Case
of the Outdated Guidelines. Last year, a foundation’s proposal deadline was
October 30, but this year it’s September 30, but the change happened before
they could print new guidelines. How can you find this out? Check the Web
site to make sure that you have the most current copy of their grant guide-
lines. More and more, funders are beginning to provide that information on
the Web: it saves them time and trouble (and postage), and makes accessing
the information that much easier for you. See Chapter 6 for more on using the
Internet to research funders.

Digging deeper to find the right grantor
The foundation and corporation reference books and Web sites provide a
wealth of information about the grant makers you want to investigate. Which
pieces of information are important? What data is most helpful? Find the fol-
lowing data for each corporation or foundation:
 The areas the corporation or foundation funds. Many foundations sup-
port a wide range of areas in varying degrees. For example, in 2004–2005,
the Pew Charitable Trusts Foundation awarded 128 grants totaling $99
million. Sixty percent of the grants went to Public Policy related causes
(which is great news for you if you’re part of a public policy activist
group), but only 20 percent went to improvement of Civic Life. You can
use this information to help you determine which candidates are most
likely to fund your particular project and which ones are the long shots.
 What the amount of the average grant is. The reference books list both
a grant range (from smallest to largest) and an average grant amount. If
you are seeking $120,000, you know that you’re way off base if you’re
considering approaching a foundation with a $35,000 average award.
 How many grants the foundation or corporation awarded last year.
Obviously, the greater the number of grants awarded, the better it looks
for you. Numbers can be deceiving in this regard; however, the foundation
Figure 11-2:
Foundations
are putting
grant
guidelines
on the Web.
188
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

probably also receives a greater number of proposals than smaller foun-
dations. More important is how closely your program fits its mission and
how clearly you make that connection.
 At what time of year, or by what date, the organization accepts pro-
posals. Different foundations have different proposal timeframes, usually
connected to when the board of directors gets together to discuss grant
possibilities. Send your proposal in plenty of time to hit the deadline.
There’s an age-old debate about whether it’s better to come in at the
wire, with the latest possible proposal, and grab a lion’s share of the
attention, or to get your proposal in early so the reviewers have time to
think about it and grow to love it. The most important thing, in our opin-
ion, is to have a well-researched, well-targeted proposal that fits the
interests and abilities of the funder and doesn’t oversell the real good
that can be done.
 The submission process the foundation or corporation wants you to
follow. How important is this? Very! Some funders want letters of
inquiry; others want full proposals; still others invite visits. Some fun-
ders won’t accept unsolicited proposals at all, so read the listings care-
fully! If you don’t do what they ask you to, even if it’s just attaching some
supporting document, you may lose on a technicality.
Inquiring Minds Want to Know: 
Letters of Inquiry and Guidelines
Some funders want you to submit a letter of inquiry before they send you the
grant application guidelines. What is a letter of inquiry, and what should you
put in it?
A letter of inquiry is a letter (okay, that part was obvious!) you write to the
foundation giving them an overview of your project and requesting the grant
application and guidelines.
The funder is looking for a way to quickly determine whether your proposal is
in line with their funding goals. They want a brief summary of your project or
program, a sense of the grant amount you are seeking, and an understanding
of the principal people in your organization, and a summary of how the pro-
grams runs. Read the listing carefully to determine just what the funder wants
to see and then do your best to deliver it in a timely and professional manner.
And what about grant guidelines? These essentially tell you how to prepare a
grant proposal just the way the funder likes it, which is important information
to have. What types of specifics do grant guidelines provide?
189
Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals

 The mission and focus of the foundation. (This typically includes the
categories in which the foundation awards funding, such as Arts &
Humanities, Education, and Health & Welfare.)
 Eligibility requirements for grant seekers
 How the foundation evaluates proposals
 What types of projects are funded and what types are not
 Questions the funders want answered in your proposal
 Deadlines for proposal submission; the schedule for grant awards
 Contact and proposal submission information
 What types of supporting materials are required and in what format
Grant guidelines are an important road map for the grant proposal you are
preparing. Some grant guidelines are available on the Web; others you call or
write for. No matter how you get them, be sure to take them seriously.
Many organizations today accept, or in some cases require, online submis-
sion of grant applications. Check the foundation’s Web site to see if they do.
This can sometimes be a lifesaver when you’re up against a tight deadline.
Sitting Down and Writing the Proposal
After you do your research and identify one or many potential funders, the
next step is to write the grant proposal. Before you start groaning, think of it
this way: grant proposal writing is the art of passing the “spark” of your mis-
sion on to those funders who may be willing and able to help in a big way.
As you create each piece of the grant proposal, use the most compelling
information from your case statement so that the proposal helps the funder
understand the following things:
 Your organization has an effective solution to a real need the funder
cares about.
 You have thought through the program carefully.
 You have planned out the process to implement it.
 You have selected strong leadership for the program.
 You have been (and will continue to be) financially responsible with the
program.
 You have a track record of accountability and will keep the funder
informed of the program’s progress.
190
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Although the proposals you write may vary depending on what the funder
wants to see, a complete grant proposal usually includes the following elements:
 Cover letter
 Executive summary (also called the abstract)
 Introduction
 Program need/program statement
 Program goals, objectives, and evaluation
 Program budget and budget narrative
 Leadership, staffing, and location
 History of the organization
 Addendums such as your 501(c)(3) letter and financial statements
How long should a grant proposal be? Only as long as it takes to convey the
problem, the solution, and the facts the funders need to make their decision.
Let the grant guidelines give you an idea of what length the funder expects.
Some foundations ask for brief (even one page!) proposals. Others leave the
length open ended. Because you want to keep the funder reading, keep the
proposal streamlined and interesting. Don’t restate on page 4 something you
said on page 2. Tighten your prose and lead the reviewer to the conclusion
that you are describing a program she’d like to fund.
In the following sections, we look at the elements of a grant proposal one 
by one.
Creating a successful cover letter
Your cover letter introduces your organization and explains to the funder
what is in the proposal package. The cover letter also includes any and all
contact information you can provide for your organization, including e-mail
addresses and a Web page, if you have one.
Executing a stylish executive summary
The executive summary has been called the single most important section in
your proposal. It should be short — one to two paragraphs — but complete.
The executive summary should give a complete overview of your proposal,
telling the funder who you are, about the need, how your organization plans
to respond to the need, how the funder can help you affect that response,
and how much money you need to do that. Because of the volume of propos-
als foundations receive, they are often divided among board members to
191
Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals

review, and the executive summaries are the sections that speak to the over-
worked, time-crunched executive. Make your case clearly, compellingly, and
concisely in your executive summary.
Ask a number of people both inside and outside your organization to read
over your executive summary after you finish it. How could it be better? Does
it get to the point quickly enough? Does it say what you want to say? Use the
reactions of your peers to streamline the summary so that it’s as effective as
possible.
Introducing yourself
The introduction should also be brief, explaining a little more specifically
what’s to come in the grant proposal. You can include a table of contents if
you choose, although in shorter proposals, this is unnecessary.
Stating the program need 
in a program statement
Your program need should paint the picture of the cause that your organiza-
tion exists to support. This and the program statement can come right out of
your case statement, if that document is up-to-date. You may want to tweak
the information a bit, including specific examples of people who have been
helped by your organization or situations that need your help, which can
help the funder “connect the dots” between the need you are describing and
the real people you serve as well as what you’re proposing and potential
funder’s funding criteria. The more you can connect what you need with the
funder’s mission, the more chance you have of obtaining that grant.
Outlining program goals, objectives, 
and evaluation
This section shows the funder that you have thought through, step-by-step,
the goals you want to achieve through this program. You may have a number
of different measurable goals, such as:
Goal 1: Increase teen participation by 15 percent.
Goal 2: Open the youth center on weekends from October to May.
Goal 3: Implement teen leadership program by June 1.
192
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Objectives are the smaller, measurable increments that detail the specific
steps you want to take to reach your goal. Objectives tend to measure either
a process step or an outcome. An example of objectives for Goal 1 might be:
Objective 1-1: Host a Web design workshop for teens where they upgrade
our site.
Objective 1-2: Meet with school counselors and caseworkers to identify
new candidates.
Objective 1-3: Increase awareness through PSAs, posters, and media outlets.
Objective 1-4: Use volunteers to increase awareness.
Evaluations inform the funder of your timeline for when and how you will reach
the objectives you list. Be sure that your evaluations are measurable. For exam-
ple, for Objective 1-1, a measurable evaluation would be “Workshop will be
scheduled before March 15 and will include a participants’ sign-in sheet.” This
timeline and plan for the sign-in sheet helps you be sure that you are actually
working, with provable data, toward both your objective and your goal.
Detailing the program budget 
and budget narrative
As you might expect, any funder thinking about giving you money is going to
want to know specifically what you plan to do with it. Your budget needs to
show that you’ve thought it all out, that you’ve tried other sources (or plan to),
and that you are willing to make investments yourself in order to make the pro-
gram happen. Most foundations, corporate or private, want to know that you
have a “100 percent giving board” before they award a grant to your organiza-
tion. They also want to know that you have sought creative ways to have serv-
ices and goods provided as in-kind donations. (See Chapter 4 to find out more
about giving boards and Chapter 5 for more about in-kind contributions.)
The budget narrative explains your budget numbers in broad but accurate
terms. You don’t need to walk the reviewer through every nickel and dime (nor
should you include every nickel and dime in your balance sheet — rounding to
dollars will do). But you do need to explain where your major expenditures will
be, how you’ve planned for them, who you’ve approached, and what results
you anticipate. Be as clear and forthcoming as you can, but expect questions.
Foundations often ask for clarification on various points in your proposal.
Instead of being alarmed when you get the call, be excited: It means that the
funder is interested enough in your idea to pursue it further.
193
Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals

Leadership, staffing, and location
You need to tell the foundation about the leadership you’re selecting to run
the program or project. This information is very important to the funder
because having good leadership is as important as having a well-thought-out
plan, and the funder wants to know that you have the people to put your pro-
gram into action. Include biographies and resumes of the key people involved
with the program, and be prepared to have them sit in on a site visit if the
funder asks to meet with you face to face.
The location of the program or project gives the funder a good idea of what
type of facility you have, which ties to the practicality and the “thought-
through-ness” of your idea. If you plan to increase teen participation by 15
percent but you’re already up against the fire marshal’s limit for your small
bungalow, the funder may question your plan. If you have a nice facility with
room to grow, the site will work to your advantage. Having an appropriate
facility assures the funder that your program — and ultimately its money —
makes a real impact on the need you so eloquently communicate.
Running down your history
Some grant proposal books may tell you to lead with the history of your organ-
ization, and you certainly can do that if you believe that your organization’s
history plays heavily to what you’re trying to communicate in your proposal.
In most cases, however, the reader skips over what you did yesterday to find
out what you’re doing today. History is important, but in a grant proposal, it’s
probably not the most important thing you want to communicate. Because
you have only a few minutes of the reviewer’s time, it’s better to lead with the
strong stuff and include the history at the end.
Your organization’s history may include a long list of accomplishments and
famous people who have aligned themselves with your mission, or it may be
the simple story of a need and the people who address it. Examples of your

 On Philanthropy: www.onphilanthropy.
com

accomplishments should illustrate your ability to make a difference.
Whatever your story is, remember to tell it with heart and spark.
The rest of the story
At the end of your proposal, you need to attach a copy of your 501(c)(3)
letter from the IRS, at least one year of financial statements (certain funders
may request more), and your organization’s budget for the current year (not
just the program or project budget that you included in the proposal). Check
the guidelines for any additional materials that might be required, such as
sample marketing materials.
Following Up on Your Proposal
How long do you wait after you submit a proposal before you follow up? Until
your fingernails are gone? Until you can’t stand it anymore?
Most funders will give you an idea in their grant guidelines what to expect in
terms of review time. If you are uncertain, call and ask how long you should
wait before checking back. You may get a “don’t-call-us, we’ll-call-you”
response, but in most cases the administrative assistant will give you a work-
able timeframe. A brief call or letter after that day comes and goes will suffice
for contact, but stay current with your contacts, documenting your calls and
the responses. Most funders respond in a reasonable amount of time, and
you’ll most likely be contacted with questions and/or visit possibilities if they
are actively interested.
And besides, who has time to sit around and worry about a submitted pro-
posal? You have to start researching those corporations!
195
Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals
How goals, objectives, and evaluations differ
A goal answers the question, “What do we
want to accomplish?”
An objective answers the question, “How will
we accomplish that goal?”
An evaluation answers the question, “How will
we know that we’ve accomplished it?”

Putting a Positive Spin on “No”
What does a “No” mean? It could mean any number of things:
 The funder has already funded many programs similar to yours this year.
 The funder has other priorities right now. For example, you may have
submitted a grant for your arts organization, and the funder is currently
focusing on educational issues.
 The funder didn’t understand what you were asking for.
 The timing isn’t right, and the funder may want to wait until you’re fur-
ther along in the development of your program.
 The funder doesn’t feel that your organization is at the right point in its
growth to tackle the proposed undertaking.
 The funder isn’t the right one for your organization.
“No” is not the end of the world. Review your proposal to make sure that it’s
as strong as you can make it, and try the next candidate on your list.
196
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 
Handling a site visit
Before giving a major grant, foundation repre-
sentatives want to come see what you do. The
experience of seeing the need and the work
firsthand is very telling — and often inspiring.
What should you do when the foundation con-
tacts you and wants to make arrangements for
a site visit?
 Relax. The foundation isn’t coming here to
“check up” on you or debunk your great pro-
posal. Instead, the grantors are interested in
seeing with their own eyes how the work
you do fits with their mission and goals.
 Plan. Think about what the representatives
can participate in that would give them a
taste for your mission. Think “hands-on,” as
opposed to “presentation.” Meeting your
clients, hanging out with your teens, and
hearing your patrons talk about the differ-
ence your organization has made can have
a bigger impact than charts and figures
over coffee.

by Using the Media
In This Chapter
 Using radio, TV, print, and the Internet to get your news out
 Getting along with the media
 Dealing with damage control on media disasters
You’re not camera shy, are you? Don’t worry — many people are, at first.
But being willing and able to pursue media exposure for your organiza-
tion is not only smart for your fundraising program; but also it’s advantageous
for building the overall credibility of your cause. Arming yourself with some
basic how-tos for handling, and even enjoying, media relations can give you
the confidence you need to see media for what it is: a golden microphone to
address masses of people.
Although working with media takes a little time and some careful and creative
thought, your use of the media can go a long way toward building the aware-
ness and reputation of your organization. Having an outgoing personality
helps, but it’s not a prerequisite. All you have to do is master a few media
basics and you can communicate your cause clearly and with passion.
In this chapter, we take you through a number of media channels, helping you
investigate ways to get positive attention for your nonprofit organization
through radio, television, print media, and the Internet.
Getting Out There and Getting
Media Exposure
Many fundraisers work day in and day out without giving a lot of thought to
media coverage. If media attention happens, great (assuming it’s positive!),
but who has time to go looking for it? When you consider the amount of time

you spend researching donors, narrowing your list, and educating people
about your mission and your programs, however, you realize that spending
just a little time planning some media exposure can pay back many times
over in terms of public awareness and interest.
How can you use media exposure to help your organization?
 You can create a radio spot, advertising your upcoming gala.
 You can do a television interview, talking about a new survey on teens,
released by your organization.
 Your organization can be the subject of a feature article in your newspa-
per or local magazine that ties in to concerns in your community.
 You can participate in an online chat in a Web site that deals with issues
in your organization’s area of work.
Think of media exposure as simply education. When you run the 30-second
radio spot, you are telling the listeners:
 Who you are
 What you do
 Why they should care
 How they can help
In the television interview, perhaps on your area’s News at Noon, you can
 Show viewers what your organization is about. (This visual may be the
name and phone number of your agency or your organization logo 
displayed on the television screen, or a video of a recent event at your
facility.)
 Allow viewers to put a face with a name.
 Inform viewers about your organization, perhaps for the first time.
 Interest viewers in your organization’s current happenings or upcoming
events.
In a print article in your local paper, you can
 Relate how your organization is currently addressing real needs in your
community.
 Convey a sense of the spark of your mission.
198
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

 Educate readers about various programs.
 Include contact information encouraging readers to donate time, goods,
or money.
For many nonprofits, the road to media exposure begins with a simple press
release, which can be mailed or faxed, promoting the accomplishment or
the need. Be sure to include the name of someone who can be contacted
about the information. You can follow up with a phone call, if you want.
This approach is likely to work better if you have taken the time to develop
good relationships with media leaders in your community. Human-interest
stories — stories of people’s successes, challenges, and needs that draw
empathy and sympathy — are widely used in all media, and most nonprofits
have these stories by the dozens.
Just as you do with donors and grantors, find out what interests your local
media and how you can help your needs and theirs come together. These
people get inundated with press releases and bids for inclusion on their
pages. Give them interesting information in a professional format and you’ll
get into their good graces.
199
Chapter 12: Projecting Your Image by Using the Media
A time for us
One of the challenges in getting media exposure
is that you have very little time in which to say
some really important things. Take a look at
these comparisons:
Radio: A typical PSA (public service announce-
ment) gives you only 30 to 60 seconds of airtime.
Television: Even a lengthy news interview may
be only two minutes of actual airtime; when you
clip out newscaster lead-ins and voice-overs,
you may have only one minute of real footage
from your organization or your interview. More
typically, you have less than 30 seconds.
Online: If you are leading a chat, you have a
longer period of time (up to an hour, in some
cases); but the medium requires tight control —
a group chat can be like carrying on 20 individual
conversations at once. Moderated discussion
forums and your own Web site allow you to post
information and leave it there indefinitely for
people to see. An online broadcast or “Webcast”
can give you greater flexibility, but viewers tend
to watch only the first few minutes of live or pre-
recorded content.
Print: Print is a medium in which the time allot-
ted is virtually unlimited. You may have an hour
interview with a reporter, which translates into
a (hopefully) good story that the reader can read
again and again if she chooses. If the article
appears on the newspaper’s Web site, you can
link to it from yours for even greater exposure.
Keep copies of print articles to make available
in your fundraising packets, as well.

Working in Sound Bytes: Public Service
Announcements (PSAs)
If you aren’t using any media at all right now, you may be pleased to find out
that you have one completely free media avenue open to you right this very
minute — PSAs. PSAs are radio, television, and sometimes print stories that
enable you to get the news out about what your nonprofit organization is
doing. Are you hosting a chili cook-off next month? You can record a PSA
about it. Are you preparing to release your latest community development
report? You can let your city know through a PSA.
Government regulations of the public’s airwaves require that TV and radio
offer free public service announcements to local nonprofit organizations.
Although many newspapers offer such announcements as part of their civic
responsibility, no federal regulation requires that they do so.
When you talk to the folks at the radio station, request that your PSA be aired
during prime listening time (6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.). Often PSAs get pushed to
the off-peak hours (7:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) because the paying clients fill the
commercial air slots, but it’s worth asking for prime time. Also, don’t hesitate
to ask if they offer special deals for nonprofits buying airtime; many do.
Most stations allow nonprofit organizations to come into their studios and
tape the spot with their equipment. You don’t have to spend the money to
have the segment professionally produced at a recording studio. Many do have
requirements about how much advance notice that you need to give them.
Check with the station’s community affairs director to get the local rules.
Alternately, use your computer sound recording program (Windows has this
feature built into Windows Media Player, for example) with an attached micro-
phone to record the spot and submit it in electronic format on a CD or even
via e-mail.
What should you include in a PSA?
 Your organization’s name
 Your nonprofit status (if you are a 501(c)(3), the IRS designation of a
nonprofit, say so)
 Your mission
 Who you serve
 Important information about the event or project you are announcing
 A way to contact you for more information (include your phone number
and Web site or e-mail address, if it’s easy to remember)
200

Consider this example of a 30-second PSA for a small nonprofit:
Blankets for Emma is a nonprofit organization in the Toledo area organized
to provide support, education, and warmth to those caring for HIV-positive
infants. This February 23, Blankets for Emma will host its first annual Knit-
A-Thon at the Cathedral High School gymnasium from 1:00 p.m. to 8:00
p.m. For more information on how to participate in the Knit-a-Thon or to
sponsor our knitting volunteers, call Dorene Wilson at 555-555-5555.
If you are recording for radio for the first time, here’s a tip: smile. When you
smile as you read, the sound of your smile carries in your voice — no kidding!
Listeners will find your voice more pleasant and personable and may just end
up smiling, too.
Looking Good on Video
Come on; tell the truth — you have always wanted to be on television, right?
With the seemingly endless range of cable channels, the ever-lengthening
morning and nightly news, and the dozens of talk shows (stay away from the
ones that tend to have fistfights), television presents you with a great oppor-
tunity for wide exposure.
Getting on the small screen
Getting on television can be a major deal for the small nonprofit. For larger
organizations, television may be ho-hum, just part of a day’s work. The big-
city symphony hires professionals who know how to work with television:
from “Meet the Conductor” interviews to “Saturday Sonatas” breaks between
cartoons on Saturday mornings; these symphony leaders know how to use
the airwaves to reach out to their constituents — and their constituents’ chil-
dren. For the small nonprofit, however, you frequently may be on your own.
Here are a few examples of ways you can get television coverage:
 Promote a special, black-tie event where a prominent personality is
appearing.
 Suggest a feel-good story for the nightly news about a success you were
involved with.
 Work on a televised fundraising campaign for your public television sta-
tion. (Hey, don’t laugh — you could sit there for an hour answering the
phone with your nametag and organization name in front of you. The
message to viewers is “we help other organizations, too,” and that says a
lot about the character of your agency.)
201
Chapter 12: Projecting Your Image by Using the Media

 Do one of those PSAs we cover in the preceding section “Working in
Sound Bytes: PSAs.”
 Do a how-to segment on a locally produced show. For example, in
Indianapolis, you can produce a segment for the local public-television
show Across Indiana on the restoration of the historic gardens at
Garfield Park.
 Pay for advertising time, instead of only using what’s free.
 Use your own local public access cable station to televise your own
telethon fundraiser, getting people to come in and perform while your
volunteers pick up the phones and collect dollars.
Not all TV minutes have to be donated. The United Way is now paying for
some airtime, which is a big change from using only donated airtime as they
did in the past. United Way found that by paying for the time, it could choose
the prime time spots it wanted, rather than having to accept the time spots
given for free. Because PSAs frequently run in time slots unattractive to
advertisers, the shift to buying airtime means that the United Way is more
likely to reach its target audience and increase awareness in the areas they
most want to affect. To help the cost of the purchased airtime go as far as
possible, the United Way was able to get participating stations to match the
amount of time purchased as an in-kind donation.
Handling television interviews
Suppose that your idea has captured the attention of a local TV news producer.
She’d like to send a reporter out to talk to you about the ranch you run for at-
risk teens. Now what?
First, say, “Sure! Come on out!” in the most confident voice you can muster.
Next, you need to prepare for the interview. Use the following list to help you
prepare:
 Who is the best person to talk to the reporter? Whether it’s the founder,
the board president, the executive director, or you, make sure that
the person who does the talking is (1) personable; (2) articulate; and
(3) passionate about your organization’s mission and the work you are
currently doing.
 You only have a very few minutes on tape. What do you want to say most?
Get clear in your mind what you most want to say and then, even if the
reporter asks questions that take you in a different direction, steer the
conversation back around to what you really intended to say about your
organization. (See Public Speaking For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Malcolm
Kushner [Wiley] to get ideas on how to make a flawless presentation!)
202
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

 What do you want viewers to see? Think through the eyes of the camera.
What does the place look like? Where should the interview be shot? How
can you help viewers get a sense of your mission? The best impact is the
picture of work actually being done, not people talking about the work
that is done somewhere off-camera. If you have footage of your people at
work, provide it to the producer to cut away to during your interview.
 Think success stories. Although the temptation to focus on the need
may be great, remember that you want to show viewers that good things
are happening at your organization and inspire them to want to be part
of the good that’s going on.
You don’t have anyone who is media-savvy? Check again. Every volunteer list
has somebody who has done some public relations (PR) work in the past. (If
you haven’t asked your volunteers to fill out time and talent sheets, check
out Chapter 4.) Contact that volunteer and ask him or her to help you pre-
pare for your television interview. If you search the list and come up empty,
contact a local PR firm and ask them to donate 30 minutes of their time as an
in-kind donation to review some TV basics with you. Or get a good book on
public and media relations from your local library or bookstore.
Of course, if you’re a big outfit (and sometimes even if you’re not), it’s not
unthinkable to partner with a local station to do a 30-minute documentary on
your organization, its mission, its history, and its future. As you would expect,
though, this requires establishing a good relationship with your local media,
which takes time, talent, and persistence to pay off.
Taking Advantage of Print Opportunities
Suppose that getting into print is your objective. Depending on your back-
ground and the type of organization you are working with, this may be easier
than getting a slice of that coveted airtime you need for a television interview.
What kind of print opportunities do you have in your area?
Your local media may include
 A daily or weekly newspaper (morning and afternoon in some cities)
 County newspaper
 Chamber of Commerce publications
 Local business journal
 Locally produced magazines
 Community newsletters
 Corporate newsletters that sometimes spotlight employee volunteer
activities
203
Chapter 12: Projecting Your Image by Using the Media

And what are they all looking for? Something quotable (see “Making yourself
quotable,” later in this chapter) — things that people will talk about and
repeat today and tomorrow and come back for more.
A key to making good use of print coverage is to use every bit of news as
another reason to get in print. If you run a playwriting competition, announce
that you’re accepting entries, and you’ve selected judges; publicize the pend-
ing final deadline for entries, the judges’ choices, the awards ceremony, and
so on. Build excitement about longer programs and keep the public engaged.
Making yourself quotable
Editors love a good quote, and there’s nothing wrong with writing a few
favorites up beforehand. After you have identified what you want to say, you
can write a few statements that relate to that idea. For example, if you are
going to be interviewed about the upcoming Knit-a-Thon for Blankets for
Emma, you may want to mention the 60 families you served last year through
this event. Possible quotable remarks may be:
“Helping 60 families warms a lot of people.”
“We want to be the warm embrace that helps families face the cold shock
of HIV.”
“Blankets for Emma was born out of a basic human need for comfort in a
time of crisis.”
“Helping makes me feel good,” said one 7-year-old volunteer.
“One smile on one face can make my day.”
What makes a good quote? To make a good quote, your statement must
 Sound right
 Be short enough to remember
 Tug at the heartstrings, the intellect, or both
 Include either a direct or indirect call to action
In other words, your quote should almost burst with meaning and impact.
Fixing mistakes in print
What happens when the reporter gets it wrong? He forgets to add that you
are a 501(c)(3), and he publishes your fundraising goal for your new cam-
paign as one million when it’s really only $250,000. Worst of all, he misspells
204
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

the name of your biggest donor, the one who recently gave you a donation
large enough to purchase art supplies for your kids for the next three years.
What do you do when the article is just plain wrong?
First, keep your cool. Next, write down the errors in the article and call the
reporter on the telephone. Go over the items with him (calmly), and ask him
to print a correction in the same spot in the next issue. He probably needs to
talk it over with his managing editor (in fact, you may need to talk it over
with his managing editor, as well), but most newspapers are willing to correct
errors that you call to their attention. And the correction gets your name in
print again.
Choose your battles wisely. Don’t be ready to duke it out over every mis-
spelling or the erroneous reporting of an upcoming event. If the article com-
promises your mission, tarnishes your reputation, or in some other way
creates a negative public awareness, by all means take your case to the
editor. You want to maintain a long-term relationship with the publication,
but be willing to contest false or misleading statements in print.
Leveraging Online Coverage
The newest media on the block is on the Internet. Nonprofit organizations are
getting more and more active online because in most cases it’s free exposure
to a huge audience. Most have their own Web sites. Chapters 15, 16, and 17
deal in-depth with a number of Web issues, but in this chapter we look at
media exposure online.
Your first step is to get “Net savvy.” If you’re not an experienced Web
researcher, it’s time to get busy. Use the search engines that we suggest in
Chapter 11 to look for sites that talk about the topics philanthropy, charitable
giving, fundraising, and nonprofit organizations. Search for sites that relate to
your mission: If you help homeless teens, search with terms such as “teens,”
“homeless,” and “runaways.” Check out the promising sites and find out
 What they have to offer in terms of information or resources
 Whether they allow nonprofits to put their own links on the site
 Who you can contact if you want to contribute an article idea or story
Posting your story everywhere
You can also approach the editors of online versions of print publications
about possibilities for features articles. Sites such as MSNBC (www.msnbc.
com), USA Today (www.usatoday.com), or your local newspaper may be open
to your ideas. Visit them and review their policies on article submissions.

Chapter 12: Projecting Your Image by Using the Media

Though the Web has global reach, for your purposes you’re most likely to get
interest in your cause right in your own community. Your area (city, county,
region) may already have a Web site dedicated to local nonprofits. Or, if you
don’t find a site that’s completely dedicated to NPOs, you probably can find a
community site that lists events and happenings in your area. Our hometown
of Indianapolis has www.indy.com and http://community.circlecity.
com/, which, among other things, give nonprofits free exposure on the Web.
The information the nonprofits provide on these sites is nothing fancy, of
course; but you can add your organization’s name and mission to a page
along with a link to your organization’s own Web site. (You do have a Web
site, don’t you? If you don’t, you may want to seek some grant funding to
develop one.) Figure 12-1 shows a simple listing of youth and family organiza-
tions on http://community.circlecity.com.
When you list your organization on a community Web page, be sure to
include a link to your own site; then when visitors click the link, they can get
more information, and perhaps even make a donation, from your Web site.
A banner ad is an advertisement on a Web page that stretches, like a banner,
across the displayed page. Banner ads often use animation to attempt to grab
the visitor’s attention while they are reading the content of the page.

Hopping on news feeds
A lot of sites don’t have time to write all their own content. They use some-
thing called news feeds or RSS (really simple syndication) to pull stories from
other sources and display them, or links to them, on their site. The Christian
Science Monitor and CNN are just two sites that offer news feeds. Some news
feeds aggregate stories from many sources. The point is that getting your
story placed on a site that provides news feeds of its stories to others multi-
plies your exposure.
One other hot source of online information is blogs (short for Web log). A blog
is simply a collection of frequently updated stories, comments, and links.
Individuals who simply want a soapbox run some blogs. Major media publish-
ers or special interest groups run others. Search online for “blog directories”
to find lists of all kinds of blogs with all kinds of focuses, and then try to get
your information included on the ones most directly related to your cause.
Making Friends with the Media
Does your local feature reporter yawn when he sees you coming? Have the
radio stations stopped running your PSAs? How do you get your media con-
tacts to wake up and take notice of the good things that are going on at your
organization?
The following list provides a few ideas on how to come up with stories and
other media ideas that the media will want to run:
 Plan an event that links with another story currently in the news. For
example, if a measles outbreak has occurred in your area, your Vaccines-
for-Every-Child program fits right into the media hoopla. Or, if you run a
literacy program, you could plan a Read-A-Thon to occur just before
school starts to fund your new reading program, and plan a Graduate
Celebration at year’s end to reward clients who have achieved their
goals through your program. These success stories make a nice topper
to the sometimes hard-to-take evening news.
 Look for happy media opportunities. Suppose that someone’s favorite
feline climbed to the top of the tallest tree at your recent Humane
Society pet show, and your board president, who also just happens to be
the fire chief, climbed a ladder and got her down. Grab your camera, or
better yet, alert the media, if they are close. You just might get to be the
“good news” at the end of the show. (Of course, don’t create such oppor-
tunities where none exist — experienced news people can smell a plant-
the-cat-in-the-tree hoax a mile away, and it can damage your relationship
and your credibility with the press. Besides, you don’t want to endanger
a pussycat or your board president for your 15 seconds of fame.)
207
Chapter 12: Projecting Your Image by Using the Media

 Don’t wait for the media to call you. If you have a good idea, be willing
to talk about it. Don’t alienate your media contacts by barraging them
with inane ideas, but when you have an interesting idea that lends itself
to a good radio, television, or print story, knock on the necessary doors.
 Stay tuned to the media in your area, and in your area of service.
Know which topics are hot now and which are yesterday’s oatmeal. Don’t
approach a television producer with a story on a clown rodeo that your
ranch is hosting the same week that a clown is arrested for drunk driving.
 Refresh your content. If you’ve been describing your organization the
same way for two years in every press release, or if the paragraph at the
end of your releases describing the history your group has read the
same for five years, rewrite it to jazz it up.
Be sensitive to the timing, the ideas, and the amount of work your ideas create
for the reporter and producer. The more you can do yourself, the more attrac-
tive your idea will be.
Remembering on-air cues
When you’re sitting in the hot seat and feel that the big open eye of the
camera is on you (or the oversized microphones hanging above your head),
keep your wits about you and remember these things:
 This is FUN! Relaxing is the name of the game, and if you practice what
you want to say most until you know it inside and out, you can relax and
be yourself and say what you came to say. Don’t think that we’re advocat-
ing reciting a script, however — we’re not! Instead, know your thoughts
well enough that you can relax and say them naturally, as you would say
them to a friend. You’re representing good work. That belief in itself, and
not your performance, is what carries the day.
 Practice, practice, practice. Before you go on the air, try a mock inter-
view with a friend or colleague, especially if you know somebody with
public speaking or media experience.
 Keep it short. Whether you are being interviewed or contributing to a
panel discussion, keep your comments brief and packed with meaning.
We all roll our eyes at the puffed-up experts who hog the camera and
drag out to five minutes what could have been said in one. Say what you
want to say, say it smart, say it fast, and be as clear as possible. Your
viewers and listeners (and interviewers) will thank you for it.
 Give them something to remember. When we are interviewed, we try to
leave viewers or listeners with something concrete they can try, a new
idea to consider, or a new tool to use, whether they are in our industry
208
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

or just listening casually out there in Audience-land. For example, if you
work for Blankets for Emma, encourage viewers or listeners to be sensi-
tive to families in need and provide the name and address of a Web site
or national clearinghouse for HIV statistics. Or, if you work in a literacy
program, list three things parents can do to help their children love
reading. Whatever your area of service, find something that will help
viewers and listeners be glad that they tuned in.
 Make a good first impression. Start your interview smiling, whether you
are on camera or sitting in a recording studio. Relax as much as you can,
and keep a positive frame of mind, even if you think that you may be
asked some tough questions and inside are quivering a bit. When the
camera’s red light blinks on, don’t do a Fred Flintstone and stare blank-
eyed and slack-jawed into the lens. As the producer counts down, take
a deep breath and release it, sending with your exhale any negative
thoughts and tensions about the interview. Then smile and answer the
questions one at a time, as they come, in the best way you know how.
That is good enough. (For more on how to do a great interview and get
control of your nerves, see Public Speaking For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by
Malcolm Kushner.)
 Dress for success. On video, which is what most media use these days
to record, busy patterns in your clothing can actually cause distracting
patterns. Avoid patterns and stripes, or bright white clothing. Your best
bet is something simple and subdued. And here’s a little tip: blues work
great on video.
 Don’t just tell them; show them. If you have control over any part of the
story — for example, if the television crew is sending a cameraperson
out to your facility to film the interviews on-premises — use every
opportunity to show viewers what you do instead of simply telling them.
You can always talk about your programs (the editor can put it in as a
voice-over), but let the video show your enthusiastic volunteers working
with the people you serve. That, done well, carries a powerful message
words cannot convey.
People are people are people, and even in an interview, you aren’t talking to a
camera, you’re talking to a person. Even when it’s a call-in show, there are
real people at the other end. Remember that the person you are talking to is
the most important person in the world at that time. This great advice came
to us early on from a person experienced in dealing with the media. What
hangs us up in interviews is often the intimidation of it all — a new area,
something outside our normal comfort zone, with so much seeming to ride
on our individual performance.
Give each person your undivided attention and focus carefully on the subject
at hand. The media feeling just falls away and it becomes part of what you’re
so good at: that relationship-building skill that is so much a part of the fabric
of fundraising.

Chapter 12: Projecting Your Image by Using the Media

Controlling the damage of media disasters
Not to end this chapter on a somber note, but we thought that we’d better give
a few tips on what to do when the perfect interview doesn’t materialize. If you
follow the suggestions throughout this chapter, of course, you shouldn’t have
any big media blunders right there on the air. But sometimes things happen
outside your control: a board member gets investigated for something, a volun-
teer feud breaks out, and an inebriated MC hosts a special event. There may be
times when you get exposure that you don’t want.
Getting the crisis under control fast
When a disaster does happen and the media comes running, you need to
think quickly on your feet about what to say to protect the reputation of your
organization, and to protect the trust you’ve built with your community. Here
we give you some ideas that will help you to quickly handle such a situation:
 Don’t be defensive. Denial is not only pointless; it can be downright
dangerous when you’re talking about reputations, as the current politi-
cal environment in the United States has shown. Instead of defending
your organization, shifting the blame, or claiming innocence, evaluate
the situation as quickly as possible and then face the issue head-on. (It’s
okay to tell the media, “We don’t know yet, but we’re finding out,” until
you know what happened.)
 If you goofed, admit it. You may think that this is a logical outcome of
not being defensive, but admission is something else again. Did you drop
the ball and apply $10,000 in restricted funds to your scholarship pro-
gram? Admit it. Whether it’s a public or private gaff, be determined to
tell the truth about it. Of course, if it’s a private issue, there’s no reason
to go seeking media exposure to reveal your mess. That’s not the kind of
exposure that you want!
 Do something about it. If somebody has been hurt or harmed, or maybe
just annoyed, and the media picks up the story, start by saying, “Our
organization doesn’t exist to create situations like this. We’re here to
help at-risk teens master the skills they need to be successful in life.
We’re not yet sure how this happened, but we are going to make very
sure that this doesn’t happen again. Now, here’s what we’re going to do
about it . . . ” And then be sure to provide specifics on how you will
approach this situation in the future. The bad press turns into an aware-
ness-building story that can help people find out about your organiza-
tion and how it responds to a problem.
 Don’t ignore the situation. Be sure to address continuing questions
about the problem with an honest face and straight talk. This reaction is
important, both for the continuing pride of your organization (seeing
how you and your board weather this storm gives added strength to
your staff and volunteers) and for the rebuilding of your relationship
with the community.
210
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

When trust has been broken, a quick fix and a claim of redemption doesn’t
guarantee anyone’s belief; be prepared to use this situation as a positive
building block — and a significant learning experience — for the organization
you want to be in the future.
Drafting a media disaster plan
Although nobody wants to anticipate media disasters and consider ways to
limit the damage done as a result, having a disaster control plan is a good
idea — both for you, as the fundraiser, and your board, as the protectors of
the organization. In one of your board meetings, put “Media Crisis” on your
agenda and get the board talking about the following things:
 What kinds of disasters could happen in our area of service?
 What’s the worst that could happen?
You may want to role play a few of these uncomfortable scenarios. Or
perhaps simply write out a few examples that would be realistic for your
organization.
 How would we react if the worst happened?
Come up with a specific series of steps that detail who takes charge, how
you investigate, what team contacts the media outlets in your area, and
what recovery mechanisms you use to begin rebuilding your reputation.
After you have drafted a plan, write it up and make sure that each board
member has a copy. Make it part of your board packet and future board train-
ings. It’s not something you like to think about, but the potential’s there; and,
as they say, better safe than sorry.

In This Chapter

 Using the seven principles for phone calling
I
f telephone solicitation gets such a bad rap (deservedly or not), why do
so many people do it? The short answer is because it works. A number of
good things can be said about a successful phone program, one of which is
that it’s one of the least expensive means of getting to a lot of people in a
short period of time. A well-organized phone program enables you to
 Identify and contact new donors.
 Upgrade your donors.
 Piggyback on other campaigns. (For example, you may run a phone pro-
gram to work in tandem with your annual fund drive.)
 Target funds for a specific program or campaign.
 Update your donor list.
 Say thank you!
But telemarketing doesn’t have to taint the noble effort of fundraising. In this
chapter, we show you how to plan carefully and to carry out phone programs
in the best way so your phone programs can be productive, effective, and fun
as well as help build your relationships with the public, your donors, and your
volunteers. We also show you how to let people know that you’re not trying
to “get something” from them, but rather, are giving them an opportunity to
participate in good work.
Just, please, don’t call during dinner.

Making Phone Solicitation Successful
Phones, like direct mail and Internet opportunities, provide you, as a
fundraiser, with a channel for reaching potential donors. And even though
you may have a number of good reasons for developing a phone program (if
your organization doesn’t already have one), many of us still have that bad
taste in our mouths when we think about turning telephone solicitors loose
on our donor list. However, armed with a few good tips and some careful
planning, your callers can make your campaign effective.
Making your callers the good guys
When you decide to organize a phone program for your organization, make
each call an opportunity by
 Respecting people’s privacy and calling before or after traditional 
dinnertime
 Calling only those individuals you know are interested in your mission
and are likely to want to help
 Being attentive to people’s responses and engage them without being
pushy
 Caring about issues people raise and attempt to address those issues
or refer the call to someone in your organization who can
If you plan on making a significant splash in the world of telephone soliciting,
you may be interested to know that the high-end telephone industry is merg-
ing audio and data capabilities like you wouldn’t believe. In some places,
when you make a call, a computer logs your phone number; then instantly,
before the operator even says, “Hello,” all the pertinent data about your
account is displayed on the screen: where you live, how much you’ve given,
where you work, and what your dog’s name is. (Okay, maybe not the dog’s
name.) If you plan to do a considerable amount of telephoning over a long
term, look into purchasing (or getting donated) sophisticated phone and data
systems to help you capture, use, and maintain all the data that is available
through your donor list and telephone system.
When you use your phone program to update your donor list, ask people’s
opinion about a new program you’re thinking of launching, or simply say,
“Thanks” to a significant donor, you go a long way toward building that
donor-agency relationship. It’s a “no-strings-attached” call that says, “We
value you for more than just your money.”
214
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Knowing your no-call responsibilities
The last several years have seen much legislation and discussion about tele-
marketing. It’s a good idea to check the latest regulations before you start a
telephone campaign, but here’s the current scoop.
The FCC maintains a National Do Not Call Registry; however, you may not
realize that it doesn’t cover all types of calls. Only calls made to sell goods or
services through interstate phone calls are prohibited. The National Do Not
Call Registry does not prohibit calls from political organizations, charities,
or telephone surveyors.
What if you sell products to raise funds? You may still be able to call if you
have done business with the person in the last 18 months. This is considered
an existing business relationship, where, presumably, the callee has shown
an interest in your products by buying them in the past. However, if some-
body asks you not to call, even if you have an existing business relationship,
that’s it: You must not call that person again.
One final note: beyond your legal obligations, in the interest of your donor
relationship, if you get the message that somebody does not want to receive
calls, take them off your call list and find another way to communicate with
them, for example by letter or with an e-newsletter.
It’s actually illegal to telemarket to cellphones. FCC regulations prohibit tele-
marketers from calling cellphone numbers with automated dialers.
Organizing Your Telephone Campaign
How much time will you invest in getting your telephone act together? In gen-
eral, plan to spend more time preparing for your phone program than you
spend running it. The effort you put into planning will help you set realistic
goals, develop your budget, identify your prospects, train your callers, strate-
gize your calls, and evaluate your results.
Short-term phone programs can be a very cost-effective way of reaching a
large number of people quickly. Your costs may be minimal, consisting only
of printing materials for the callers, renting the phones and tables (if neces-
sary), renting a site (if you’re doing a large phone bank and don’t have the
space at your facility), and perhaps providing free pizza for your volunteers
or a thank-you dinner afterward.
Be careful about charges for calls. Sometimes the next town over, where a lot
of your donors live, may be a toll call in today’s complex telecommunications
infrastructure. Be sure to budget in those costs.
215
Chapter 13: Working the Phones (You Don’t Have to Be Hated)

Setting your goals
You need to know specifically what you want to accomplish with your phone
program, both in terms of tangible and intangible benefits. An example of a
phone program goal is to run a weekend membership drive where you sign
up 200 new members, upgrade 300 existing members, and raise $40,000. Write
your goals, and post them on the wall (in big, happy letters) where your
callers can see them.
The goals you write need to be straightforward, positive statements that
everyone involved can remember easily. Print the goals at the top of the first
page of the materials you give to callers during their orientation.
Budgeting your costs
Figure your costs for the following items as you budget for your phone pro-
gram (assuming, of course, that you’ve already followed up on every in-kind
possibility you can think of):
 Materials. Be sure to include photocopies of your mission statement,
the telephone script, a question-and-answer page, a page with contact
numbers, pledge forms, and a page listing the various membership
216

Weekend gig or long-term program?
Is it better to run an ongoing telephone solicita-
tion program or a short-term, program-related
phone campaign? The answer depends in large
part on your mission, your donors, and the
breadth of the audience you want to reach. If
you are a local organization soliciting locally,
your range of prequalified prospects will be
exhausted quickly if you plan to run a year-
round phone solicitation program. Likewise, if
you use volunteers to make the calls, their dial-
ing fingers will be worn out if you expect too
much from them for too long.
If you are part of a huge national organization,
running a phone bank on an ongoing basis may
be part of your fundraising strategy. In this case,
you will most likely hire paid staff to do the call-
ing for you, or contract the telemarketing piece
out to a full-time telemarketing organization.
Most folks, even if they run year-round phone
campaigns, take care not to overlap calls to the
same area within a specified period of time.
Getting interrupted during dinner is annoying
enough when it happens once; but if your
prospects get calls from your fundraisers two or
three times in the same month, they’re going to
strike your organization from their giving list.
Why? Because the organization isn’t handling its
data effectively (or its callers wouldn’t be call-
ing multiple times). And if an organization can’t
handle its own data, how will it handle a donor’s
money?

levels of your organization. You also need paper and pencils for volun-
teers to log the numbers they call and to take notes that fundraising staff
members may need to follow up on.
 Phone rentals and charges. If you are setting up a formal phone bank,
you need to plan for the equipment you need. Talk to your local phone
company and find out costs for things such as hard-wired phones and
cell phone rentals. Factor in any nonlocal access charges.
Consider using a Voiceover Internet Protocol (VoIP) provider for phone
calls to avoid long distance charges if you are calling beyond your local
area. Essentially this is a way to place calls by using your Internet con-
nection, circumventing your phone company entirely. Also, consider
whether you need callers to be sitting at computers to record updates to
donor data records as they solicit donations.
 Facility rental. If you need to find a location where you can run your
phone-a-thon, investigate many places before you decide. You may be
able to use a church basement, a meeting room at the library, a school
classroom, or a community center, if the facility has an adequate
number of phone lines or you have permission to get temporary lines
installed. If you plan to televise your phone-a-thon, however (such as on
your community cable station), you need a place that presents the
image you want to present, which may rule out some places.
 Food and support items. If you have a staff of 12 volunteers working
four-hour shifts, you need to sustain them with some refreshments. Free
soda, bottled water, and treats (fruit, candy, and cookies) are in order.
Boxed lunches or an end-of-the-day dinner is a good thank you. Budget
this recognition of phone-a-thon volunteers in with the overall program
because, even as you are approaching new donors or upgrading existing
ones through your phone program, you are building an increasing level
of involvement with the volunteers who are helping out.
As you plan and budget the cost of your phone program, think about asking
for in-kind as well as monetary contributions. Who could donate some boxed
lunches? Who could donate the facility or tables you need? Make a list of all
the items you need and some possible suppliers who could donate these
items, and then start calling potential suppliers early in the program. No
sense in paying out of pocket for things companies would be glad to donate.
Targeting your prospects
Planning is important. Preparing your callers is important (you hear more
about this later in this chapter). But nothing is as important to a successful
phone campaign as carefully selecting the people you plan to call. Spend time
217
Chapter 13: Working the Phones (You Don’t Have to Be Hated)

talking about your prospect list with your development committee and with
the group in charge of putting the phone campaign together. Answering these
questions can help you get a great list together:
 Where can you find your prospects? Will you buy a list, trade a list with
a sister organization, or use the list you already have? Do you have
another avenue that you can explore?
 Who in your existing list has the interest and ability to respond to the
phone program?
 Who in your community would be a good source of information on addi-
tional prospects?
 How do you alert new prospects about the upcoming phone-a-thon?
Consider mailing out postcards, letters, or a sample newsletter with the
headline, “Phone-a-thon begins March 14!” printed in the most visible
place.
It’s okay to get help in identifying prospects. But this job shouldn’t be for
one person alone. Get your development committee together, and give each
member a blank sheet of paper; set a timer for ten minutes, and ask the com-
mittee to brainstorm all the people they can think of who would be likely to
respond favorably to a phone campaign. Then compile a master list of those
names or ask each person to be responsible for contacting those people during
the phone-a-thon (and collect the lists afterward). Either way, you have a per-
sonal link (“Diane Wilson gave me your name — she thought that you would be
interested in hearing about our new program at Blankets for Emma”).
And yes, you can start at the top of your donor list, and just go down the list,
one by one, calling each person. However, selecting a subgroup that you are
fairly certain will give is a much better use of your time.

An impromptu phone bank
The new play was a smash hit. The review hit
the streets at 7:00 a.m., and by 7:30, Ingrid had
faxed copies to 12 of her strongest volunteers.
She put a note on the cover sheet: “We
received a GREAT review for our latest show!
But this weekend is the last full weekend of per-
formances, so we need to act quickly. Will each
of you please sit down right now, read this
review, and then call five friends to tell them
about the show? We’re offering a ten percent
discount to people who buy their tickets by
responding to our phone campaign. Please
make sure that you make all your calls by
Wednesday evening at 9:00 p.m., and call me at
home (555-5555) to let me know how you all did!
Thanks very much! Good luck!”
The response was terrific — 55 of the 72 people
called purchased two or more tickets. This
tactic was an effective use of a grass-roots
phone bank: People received calls from people
they knew and trusted, and the added incentive
of the discount helped sway them in the organi-
zation’s favor.

Gathering your materials
When you’re pulling together materials for your telemarketers, think “train-
ing,” and think “simplicity.” Most likely, your callers will not be experienced
in phone solicitation. You want to provide clear, focused training that keeps
them motivated and optimistic and gives them answers to their questions.
Your orientation and training packet of materials for your callers needs to
include
 Your mission statement (preferably on the first page, in plain view)
 The goals of your phone program. Knowing the goals of the phone pro-
gram helps callers keep focused on why they are calling. For example,
your goal may be to raise funds for that new delivery van; to help move
your program into third-world countries; or to send a semi-load of 
groceries and housewares to the victims of the latest hurricane. Include
with each goal the target amount you plan to raise, as well as any other
important objectives, such as the number of people you want to reach.
 A question-and-answer sheet for common questions callers may run into
 A volunteer schedule telling callers when to come in and how long
to stay
 Positive reminders for the callers to help them make the best possible
presentation
 Pledge cards for the prospect’s response
 Report forms to list the donor’s response and any items you need to
follow up on after the call
 A small notebook and a pencil for questions and notes that need
follow-up
 The donor information data sheet needed at the phone-a-thon
Give your callers sheets that contain only the numbers they are assigned
to call. Agree on a method for marking (1) calls made; (2) calls not made;
(3) out-of-service numbers so others don’t duplicate their efforts later.
 The script you want them to work with
Even though you want your callers to be natural on the phone, you need
to provide a script to remind them of key points and keep your message
consistent and avoid confusion.
Of course, the script is the single most important material you supply your
callers. In the section that follows, we provide some tips for writing a great
script.
219
Chapter 13: Working the Phones (You Don’t Have to Be Hated)

Writing the all-important phone script
Of course, each script for every organization is different (or it should be!).
But in general, your script needs to tell the listener:
 The name of the organization
 A very brief statement of the mission
 The fact that the caller is participating in a campaign to raise funds for a
specific program, and then describe what the program is
 An example sentence for the caller to use to ask the renewing member
(or current member) if she would like to upgrade her gift
For example, “We really appreciated your $25 gift last year and are
hoping that this year you’ll consider increasing that amount to $35.”
After you draft the script, which should be no more than five or six sentences,
read it aloud a number of times to check its effectiveness. Have your commit-
tee review it and also read it aloud. Be determined to edit the script until no
one stumbles, it sounds as natural as possible, and the ideas are clear and
simple to grasp. When you’re finished drafting and polishing the script, you’re
ready to give it to your callers.
Some people write their scripts with alternative phrases built in, enabling the
caller to personalize the discussion and take the conversation in the appro-
priate direction. For example, you may have the caller ask, “Have you heard
that last month our organization was awarded the Caring Hands Award for
Bartholomew County?” If the donor says, “Yes,” the caller goes on to the next
part of the script, which builds on that idea. If the donor says, “No,” the caller
takes an alternative route and gives a little history of the award and the pro-
gram that brought it about. Using alternative phrases gives your caller some
flexibility so he or she can tailor the situation to address questions the lis-
tener may want to know more about.
Questions in a script are tricky. Don’t include questions in your script unless
you also provide the caller with a response for any possible answers. For
example, if your script asks, “Of course you care about underprivileged kids,
right?” and the person being called says, “No, I don’t,” your caller will be at a
loss as to how to proceed. Either don’t phrase this as a question, or provide
suggestions of how you caller should respond to each possible answer.
One wise step to take is to read your script out loud to as many people as you
can before you hand it to volunteers to ensure that it is as natural sounding as
possible. Many volunteers don’t feel comfortable straying from the script, so
it’s helpful to give them something to read that doesn’t sound like they’re
reading.
220
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Preparing donor materials
You need to prepare a different set of materials to mail out to your prospec-
tive donors in advance of your phone-a-thon. Publish a postcard, letter, or
newsletter that lets your prospects know they will receive a call (this turns a
cold call into an expected call).
You need pledge cards, envelopes, and return envelopes to mail out to inter-
ested prospects after they say, “Yes” to your request.
Additionally, have extra organizational brochures and newsletters on hand to
send to donors who request additional information. Be sure that your callers
have a notebook or a column on their phone log to record which prospective
donors want this additional information.
Finding and training your callers
After you have a healthy list of donors and prospects, and you know what
you want to say and do, where do you get the people to make the calls? Here
are a few ideas:
 Start with your board. Anyone interested?
 Ask your volunteer corps. If you have a group of positive, like-minded
people, you may have a swirl of interest. If you have a collection of busy
professionals, you may get a lot of people looking at the ceiling. Persuade
reluctant volunteers with: (1) How much good they can do for the organi-
zation, (2) How they will benefit socially by helping in a group for only a
few hours on a special weekend, and (3) A promise of a reward, such as a
discount on their membership renewal or an invitation to a thank-you
dinner after the campaign is over.
 Go to the people you serve. If your nonprofit is a school or university,
consider asking parents, alumni, or the students themselves to do the
calling.
Hopefully, your callers will be all charged up and eager to get started. This isn’t
always the case. Some people are surprisingly intimidated by the phone —
even more so when it comes to asking for money. For this reason, give an
upbeat, team-building training session to walk your callers through the process
and encourage an atmosphere of fun and challenge.
You could hold the training session the night before the phone-a-thon begins,
and it need only last an hour. The training agenda may look like this:
 Introduction: Thank everyone for coming and tell them why the phone-
a-thon is going to be a fun thing to do. Hand out the orientation/training
packets the callers will be using.
221
Chapter 13: Working the Phones (You Don’t Have to Be Hated)

 Mission: Talk briefly about your organization. Most of your callers may
already know the main points. Focus on your recent successes and plans
for the future, which leads up to the phone-a-thon.
 Goals: Explain the goals for the phone-a-thon and get everybody excited
about achieving them. Post them on the wall as you explain them. Let
the callers know the goals are also available in their packets.
 Packets: Go through the packet of materials you assembled, explaining
each sheet, and practicing the script if you have willing participants. If
not, you take the lead and practice with a staff member. Remember to
keep the practices lighthearted, but show callers the importance of know-
ing the script, the helpfulness of a friendly voice, and why smiling works.
 Demonstration: If you have a phone available, or the phone bank is
already set up, take the callers to the tables and show them how the
phones work. Explain how make an outside call and what they need to do
if they (1) need to put a call on hold; (2) get disconnected; (3) need to ask
a staff member a question. Use the phone log sheet to show the callers
how to enter the information they receive. Explain how to get the atten-
tion of the person who will be available to help if they run into trouble.
 Schedule: Go over the calling schedule with your volunteers so they
know when to come in and how long they are scheduled to make calls.
 Q&A: Open up the floor for questions the callers may have. Be willing to
role-play to illustrate. Most important, be as upbeat and positive as pos-
sible. If the phone-a-thon is fun for the callers, the sense of lightness will
find its way into their calls, and your donors will hear it.
Practicing the script is important for callers. Suggest that they start by read-
ing the script out loud in front of a mirror, working on any places in the script
where they stumble. Have them tape themselves and listen to their tone of
voice. Is it friendly? Is it clear? Where can they improve how they handle
parts of the script? Getting callers to sound natural with your script is a big
part of keeping the potential donor on the line.
If the callers have willing friends, have them practice making a few live solici-
tation calls. Give the friend a list of questions to answer. Did anything turn
her off? Was the point communicated clearly?
Identifying the best times to call
Somebody’s dad’s favorite telemarketing deterrent: “Well, you’re calling
during dinner right now, but if you give me your home phone number, I’ll call
you back as soon as we’re done. By the way, what time do you eat?”
Okay, so if you have to catch people after work, but you can’t commit the car-
dinal sin of calling people while they are eating dinner, when’s the best time
222
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

to get them without annoying them? The answer depends to some degree on
your prospects. What kind of lifestyles do they live? Are they young, with
children? Or older, with (supposedly) quieter evenings?
While you are planning your phone-a-thon, discuss with your committee a
range of possible timeslots. When you settle on a few, call some donors that
you know personally and ask how they would feel if called during those times?
(You can also ask if they would like to help serve on the phone bank.) As you
select the timeslots for your phone-a-thon, be as respectful as you can of your
prospects’ privacy. That respect translates into more effective phoning with
fewer angry responses.
Make sure that you track your data! After your phone campaign, you need
to evaluate how much the phone campaign cost you and how much you
made, how many Yeses and Nos you got, and the number of new donors
you identified.
If the phone-a-thon lasts more than one day, choose a colored marker for
each day so that if callers on subsequent days go back through the lists to
pick up calls not made, you can tell which calls were made on which days.
For example, if Friday is Blue, Saturday is Red, and Sunday is Green, you will
be able to tell at a glance by reviewing the phone log which day your callers
contacted the greatest number of people. Similarly, have a space on your log
sheet where the caller can write in the time he began and finished that partic-
ular list; then you know not only which days the calls were made but also in
which timeslots they were made.
Troubleshooting telephone interactions
You’re bound to run into all kinds of personalities and situations when you
take your mission to the phone lines and begin a solicitation program. What
kinds of people will you encounter, and how can you best deal with them?
Here are a few of the tough types your callers may run into and a few ideas
on how to best handle them.
The big hanger-upper
You dial. He answers. “Mr. Reynolds, I’m with Blankets for Emma, a nonprofit
organization — ”
Click.
You sit staring at the phone. Do you assume he accidentally hit the discon-
nect button and call him back? That’s a judgment call, but you probably
already know the answer.
Next? Just move on, and don’t take it personally.
223
Chapter 13: Working the Phones (You Don’t Have to Be Hated)

The inquisitive listener
You dial. You smile. She answers. “Hi, Ms. Watkins, my name is Ruthie
Mayfield and I’m with More Than Enough, a nonprofit organization that 
specializes in . . .” You continue with your script.
Ms. Watkins is still listening. “And what are you asking for?”
“A donation of $35 would buy a month’s worth of cereal for the Franklin
Children’s Home,” you respond.
“And how much of that actually buys cereal?” Ms. Watkins asks. There’s an
edge in her voice.
You reply that 90 cents of every fundraising dollar goes to the cause. You
offer to send her information on your organization, which includes your
budget and expenditures.
“How long have you people been around?” Ms. Watkins wants to know.
Settle in — she has a long list of questions. And although you may want to
simply get her pledge, get off the phone, and get to the next person, answering
these questions in a helpful, forthright manner is important. You are educating
a donor — someone who could be a major donor in times to come — and that
is a valuable part of your phone program, even if it’s above and beyond the call
of duty.
The doubter
You dial. You smile. You talk. Jim Lovejoy hesitates. “How much?” he asks
again. “I don’t think I have that right now,” he says.
You try a different approach: “You do have the option of spreading your
pledge over three months,” you say, “if that would be easier for you.”
Jim thinks. “I don’t know — ”
“Perhaps you could go ahead and make your pledge today and break it up over
the three-month period, and in the meantime I’ll send you our materials show-
ing you the work we do and letting you read more about how your donation
will be spent. How does that sound?”
Jim ponders. Although you can coerce a doubter, don’t bulldoze him. Try to
sleuth out where his hesitancy lies and answer any questions you can. And at
the end of the conversation, if he’s still in doubt and unable to commit, tell
him you’ll put him on the mailing list and send him some materials. At the
very least, he may be a contributing donor in the future.
224
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

The stressed professional
On the phone, you get Madeline Outoftime, who has just rushed in from a
long and harried workday with only the time to change shoes and rush out
again to an association meeting. She answers the phone, already impatient.
“Hi! I’m with More Than Enough, a nonprofit organization — ”
“Oh! Not now! Not now! I’m on my way to a meeting and I’m going to be late — ”
You try another strategy. “Would it be okay to call you later?”
A pause. “Oh, sure. I guess. Who’d you say that you were with?”
“More Than Enough, a nonprofit organization — ”
“I’ve heard of you,” Madeline says. “Call back tomorrow evening, around 7:00.”
Professionals are often skilled at making connections and establishing rap-
port. If you call when she asks you to — 7:00 p.m. tomorrow night — you will
also succeed in building a level of credibility with her, which is just a few
steps away from making her a donor.
The disenchanted listener
Dialing . . . the phone rings once, twice, three times.
“Hello?”
“Mr. Carey, I’m with More Than Enough, and this weekend we are doing a
phone drive to raise funds for a new meal delivery van. We show that you
were a volunteer last year, and we’d like to thank you and ask whether you’d
consider making a $35 donation to help with the new van.”
Mr. Carey clears his throat. “You know, I was pretty fed up with that place,” he
said. “It was too disorganized. People had their maps mixed up. Twice I
showed up when I was scheduled, and they sent me home, saying they had
too many volunteers.”
“I’m sorry you had that experience,” you say, “and I’ve heard from other
people that things were a bit disorganized that first year we were in opera-
tion. I’m glad to say that now we have a new director and two full-time staff
members and a corps of over 60 volunteers — people like yourself who cared
about the amount of hunger in our city — unnecessary hunger — and wanted
to do something about it. You know, you should come by and visit now that
we’re well into our second year. I think you’d be pleasantly surprised by what
you see. I’d be glad to show you around myself.”
225
Chapter 13: Working the Phones (You Don’t Have to Be Hated)

From that point on, if Mr. Carey is receptive, you can talk about the growth
that is causing the need for the new delivery van, and then wind back around
to the solicitation. Before Mr. Carey will give, however, you have to deal with
the disenchantment of a negative experience with your organization; other-
wise, those feelings will stop you dead in your tracks.
Following up
After the phone campaign is over, spend time evaluating the results. But
before you do that, you need to mail out what you said that you would to the
prospects. If a donor made a pledge, you need to send the direct mail pledge
piece. If she paid by credit card over the phone, send the receipt and thank-
you note. If he requested more information, be sure that you put those items
in the mail within a few days of the end of your phone program.
Expediency is important. Set a goal to send out pledge cards or receipts
within days — maybe as quickly as one or two business days — from the end
of the phone-a-thon. This expediency communicates your professionalism to
the donor and helps build that all-important credibility. Remember to save a
few volunteers in your back pocket to help with this effort.
Playing by the Rules
Calling potential prospects or existing donors isn’t a tough thing. By keeping
some common-sense principles in mind, your callers can have a positive
phone-a-thon experience and increase both the donations and the goodwill
for your organization.
#1: Respect the donor
Throughout this business of fundraising, the idea of listening to and respecting
your donor is primary. As a representative of a nonprofit organization, you are
not out to “sell” anybody anything. You don’t want to coerce a donor to give
when he doesn’t really want to or can’t afford to. The best fundraising situation
(because fundraising is really about building relationships and joining with
others to help improve our world) happens when you reach a donor who cares
about what you do and offer him a chance to participate in the fulfillment of
your mission — through giving money, time, services, or donated goods.
226
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

#2: Be friendly
The worst thing your callers can do is sound as though they expect the person
answering the phone to hate them. While a caller is dialing, he should forget
about the stigma of telephone soliciting. He needs to remember that he’s 
different — his organization has a mission he’s proud of, and he’s giving the
prospective donor the opportunity to become part of something really excit-
ing. Even if the person answering the phone is less than friendly with the caller,
he shouldn’t take it personally. He just needs to remember that he’s represent-
ing his organization, and his friendly voice and demeanor will speak well of the
agency, even if the prospect says, “No.”
#3: Know the script
We can’t over-emphasize the importance of the script. Callers should know
it by heart, sentence-by-sentence, phrase-by-phrase. They should know the
meaning inside and out and be able to restate it in their own words. Ask
the callers to picture themselves calling a surly prospect, a pleasant prospect,
and an inquisitive prospect. How does the script fit each of these situations?
Always give your callers a fallback when the script doesn’t work, providing a
way to refer the caller to someone else at the organization.
#4: Believe in your cause
Believing in the cause shouldn’t be hard to do if your callers are willing to pick
up the phone and make calls on behalf of the organization. Have callers reread
the mission statement, visit the facility if they haven’t been there for a while,
and witness the work being done so they can bring renewed enthusiasm to the
phone effort.
#5: Use your best phone “smile”
Some people who run telemarketing rooms say that callers should dress pro-
fessionally so their professionalism carries through in their voices. Others
say that casual attire is better because a caller who is relaxed is your best
caller. Whichever side you line up on, there’s one garment callers should
always wear while phoning donors whether they’re in a suit or jeans: a smile.
When a caller smiles, her words sound different, more melodious, and the
tone rings pleasantly in the listener’s ear. A smile also helps callers stay more
relaxed and focused on the good message they’re delivering.
227
Chapter 13: Working the Phones (You Don’t Have to Be Hated)

#6: Get the donor’s name right
Just as people hate to get direct mail that has their name misspelled, if you
mispronounce the person’s name in a phone call, it does not carry well with
the recipient. The mispronounced name tells the listener, “This person doesn’t
know me,” and the thought that follows quickly is, “This person wants some-
thing from me.” Instant resistance.
As part of your donor research, familiarize yourself with the pronunciation of
all the names on your list, and make sure that your callers know the difficult
ones ahead of time. If you are uncertain about the pronunciation of some
names, ask someone who knows to help you. That first bit of contact, that
correct pronunciation of a person’s name, opens a door that is hard to pry
back open after it’s closed.
#7: Don’t take “No” personally
How many times do you say, “Yes” to a telephone solicitor? Now put yourself
in the solicitor’s seat. She receives a lot of Nos. When you are working on a
phone campaign, be prepared to hear, “No” a number of times. Don’t take it
personally. It’s not your voice or your manner or your script (although, you
should certainly be open to improving in any areas that may stand some
improvement). More than likely, it’s the simple stigma of telephone soliciting
itself. It may be the wrong time. You may have reached the wrong person.
Keep trying and shake off the Nos. And remember — each, “No” takes you
that much closer to the eventual, “Yes.”
Even when the prospect tells you, “No,” you have made an impact and a per-
sonal connection for your organization. That connection helps build aware-
ness for your agency, which may result in a donation down the road. That’s
why it’s especially important to be friendly, professional, and accommodat-
ing. Though the person may not give, he could be impressed by your group.
It’s all part of your public awareness effort.

Charging Ahead with Tchotchkes:
Giveaways, Gifts, and Sales
In This Chapter
 Thanking (and encouraging) your donors with gifts and giveaways
 Selling things to make money
 Running a raffle for dollars
A
t the grass-roots level of fundraising there are some tried and true meth-
ods of making money that put you in the role of exchanging something
for your donors’ money.
You’ve probably encountered these types of scenarios yourself:
 Your nonprofit radio station runs a campaign offering coffee mugs, DVDs
of music, or a dinner for two at a local restaurant as incentives, with the
gift depending on how much you give.
 Somebody dressed in a green dress (do Girl Scouts still do that anymore?)
comes to your door selling cookies. You immediately order ten boxes for
the good of the group (and you just love those peanut butter ones, right?).
 Your local church sells you a ticket for a chance to win a large-screen TV.
Although these approaches to raising funds can be labor intensive, what with
people answering phones, walking door-to-door, or sending out little gift pack-
ages in the mail, if you have the volunteer support, they can be successful.
The approaches I describe above can be a great way to not only raise money,
but also to raise recognition of your group throughout your community
because they are so one-on-one.
This chapter shows you the ins and outs of using all kinds of trinkets to
reward donors for their gifts, make money by selling cause-related items, and
run those ever-popular raffles to raise money.

Exchanging Gifts for Donations
Giving people something for their money can be a good way to get them to
give. Of course, these people know that the coffee cup they get for donating
$10 to your group only costs you $1.50 and that you’re keeping the profit as
a donation. But for many reasons, that gift can close the donation. And as a
side benefit, gifts, boldly emblazoned with your organization name and logo,
provide a promotional perk.
A tchotchke is a Yiddish word often used for a giveaway knickknack or trinket
without much value. This term is frequently used for items given away at
trade shows or for gifts given for donations in fundraising campaigns.
Attracting donations with gifts
Giving a gift in return for a donation works for a few different reasons:
 Even though the donor public knows that the coffee mug or T-shirt isn’t
actually free because they are handing you a check to get it, it feels like
it’s free, and people love free things.
 Many people want to give, but don’t get around to it. When they hear
that they might get a DVD of music they like, it’s just enough to push
them over the edge to give. After all, perhaps they were going to buy
that DVD anyway, or perhaps they can give it to somebody whose birth-
day is coming up, saving them the hassle of buying a present. Whatever
their reason, getting something tangible can tip the giving scales.
 For some people there is prestige in having a calendar on their desk that
sports the public radio logo, or a T-shirt that shows that they gave to the
local homeless shelter. If these folks are going to give something, they
want the world to know about it. Why not help them?
Using giveaways for maximum exposure
Keep in mind the promotional bang you can get for your incentive gift buck.
Be sure to put your organization’s name and logo on whatever you give away.
People will notice the item sitting on a desk, ask their co-worker Charlie
about your group, and if they like the little gift, perhaps even come to you to
get one of their own — in exchange for a donation, of course.
230
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Consider choosing giveaways that get the most exposure. Something that goes
on a desk at work gets seen by more people than a travel clock that only gets
seen by its owner in hotel rooms on business trips. A gift that can be worn or
carried around, like a tote bag, is a great option for maximum promotional
exposure. Gifts such as food might be tasty, but, even if chocolates can be per-
sonalized, one or two gulps, and they’re gone!
If you can afford it, you might keep a small stockpile of the most popular gifts
around after the campaign. Sometimes people contact you to get the same gift
for a donation only to find you shipped the surplus back when the campaign
ended. After all, you can always use them as door prizes at fundraising events.
Adhering to gift-giving guidelines
Does anybody really need another coffee mug with a printed logo? No.
Absolutely not. So, unless you come across a very unique coffee mug, avoid
these cliché gifts like the plague. Try for something unusual that is not being
given away by every charity in town.
Here are some gift-giving guidelines:
 Choose items that relate to your organization’s mission. If you’re work-
ing on animal rights, choose an animal shaped item. Nobody gives to a
group they have no interest in at all. The people who do give have some
connection to your mission, so play to that connection.
 Choose the best quality you can afford. You have to set a budget, so you
can actually make money off the campaign, (see the next section for
more about budget) but don’t skimp and offer something tacky. It won’t
motivate people to give, and if they do give, the tacky item will reflect
badly on your group.
 Some people get the gift to hand it on. Consider who the donor might
give the gift to. If your group is an organization that helps kids in some
way, your potential donors probably like kids and might just like a gift
that they can hand on to a child, such as a toy truck.
 If you can, offer something people can’t get anywhere else, such as a
cookbook from your volunteers or a framed copy of the poster for your
last fundraising event.
You may offer a gift the donor never actually gets, but that furthers your
cause. For example, if you’re an environmentally conscious group, offer to
plant a tree in exchange for a donation. If you help the homeless offer to pro-
vide five dinners to homeless people for the donation. Just remember to pro-
vide something — a button, a decal, or a bumper sticker, for example — that
you can send to the donor, so he can tout what he did.
231

Going gift shopping
Where do you find these fundraising gifts? There are hundreds of companies
that specialize in promotional gifts. Just about everyone of these companies
has a Web site, so start by doing a search online for “fundraising gifts” or
“fundraising incentives.” Remember that you will pay less per item the more
you buy, and these companies can print your name and logo on just about
anything in the world.
Try these Web sites to start researching your giveaway:
 www.branders.com: The variety of categories of products on this site is
impressive.
 www.justfundraising.com: Order the fundraising sample kit to get
yourself started. It’s free and can be ordered online.
 www.fundraisingdeals.com: Check out some of the fundraising advice
and links on this site, as well as a great variety of gifts.
The quality and uniqueness of the gifts you give can have a huge impact on
the success of your campaign. Take the time to choose gifts that appeal to
your potential donor base.
Calculating your return on investment
and giveaway budget
Gifts cost money, and that money comes out of your group’s profit at the end of
the day. For that reason, you should be savvy about what you give, how much
it costs, and the standard ordering practices of promotional gift companies.
First, be aware that items will cost you less the more you order, and many
companies require a minimum order. These facts can lure you into buying
3,000 glow-in-the-dark Christmas ornaments to get a great price, only to find
yourself stuck with 2,000 of them (and 2,000 glow-in-the-dark things could
light a small city).
Don’t be afraid to try to cut a deal with a promotional item vendor or manu-
facturer. If you’re making a bigger buy use the same “sales” skills you bring to
selling your donor on making a gift to get a better deal on promotional items.
With smaller vendors you might also be able to offer to spread their name
around the community to get them more business as a way to earn a discount.
232
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

Budgeting a giveaway is a logical process, if you follow these steps:
1. Set a goal for what you want to raise.
2. Determine giving ranges and set a logical formula for profitability. For
example, for a $25 donation the most you might want to spend out of
pocket for a gift is $5. If you hope to get 300 donations of $25 each, or
$7,500, this would give you a net amount raised of $6,000.
3. Don’t forget costs beyond the gift: shipping of the gifts to you, postage
to mail out the gifts, promotion of the campaign, and other items can all
add to what you have to spend to get each donation dollar.
4. Consider the timing. If you have to pay a lot of money upfront for gifts
and it will take you months to run your campaign, you may have to
lower the quantity of your initial order. Just make sure that you find a
vendor who will do a reorder promptly if you find you’re running out in
the middle of your promotion.
5. Be sure that the amount you’re spending on a gift and the amount that
you’re asking people to give for a donation match the giving ability of your
community. Don’t offer a $25 car breakdown kit for a $100 donation if most
people in your potential donor base can’t afford a $100 donation, and
don’t have a car.
Some companies accept purchase orders, which gives you a little time to
pay. But this policy may be limited to certain types of organizations, such as
schools. Also, some Web sites offer free shipping, which can save you a lot of
money in the end. Check the vendor’s payment and shipping policies before
placing the order.
Selling Cookies (or Candy,
or Whatever)!
Selling things to make a profit that goes into your groups’ coffers is a time-
honored method popular with schools, community clubs, and other local
groups. Selling offers a very different dynamic than asking for a donation with
or without a gift in return. It puts you and your volunteers on one side of a
commercial transaction, which has its pros and cons.
Here are some things you should consider when looking at launching a
fundraising sales campaign.
Today there are some pretty exotic items to sell for fundraising, so get cre-
ative. For example, Gourmetfundraising.com offers specialty foods such as
popcorn, pasta, and dessert mixes; and Itsmyartwork.com offers products
such as jigsaw puzzles and greeting cards based on children’s artwork that
you provide.
233
Chapter 14: Charging Ahead with Tchotchkes: Giveaways, Gifts, and Sales

Getting fat on selling door to door
You probably won’t raise a quarter of a million dollars with door-to-door sell-
ing, for a few reasons. First, it’s limited by the number of volunteers you can
assemble, and by the logistics of moving around the geography of your local
community. However, if you have a small initiative, say a piece of equipment
you have to buy or a trip you have to fund, selling can be a good way to go
that gets lots of people involved.
The main ingredient in selling items to raise funds is to consider whether
you have a strong foundation of volunteers who will do the selling for you.
Beyond the number of volunteers, make sure that these are people who are
comfortable with selling and that you give them something to sell that they
can believe in and that people will find attractive.
You may find that many people, kids and adults included, are comfortable
going to their family or immediate neighbors to sell, but beyond that, they
are hesitant to approach the house or apartment of a complete stranger. Set
your estimated sales figures accordingly.
In this day and age, sad to say, you have to be cautious about sending kids
or anybody else around to the door of complete strangers to sell things.
Consider asking a local store for space on their front counter or outside their
place of business to offer your goods for sale. Everybody you have working
the booth in front of the store is well protected from the dangers of walking
into a stranger’s house alone.
Organizing your sales effort
When organizing a fundraising sales campaign, there are certain key things to
keep in mind:
 Set personal goals. Everybody who is out there selling should have a
personal goal to motivate them and help you understand what your final
sales might look like.
 Create a list of prospects based on neighborhood area, specific
prospect names, or groups of people such as downtown businesses.
Provide your volunteer sales force with these leads and this guidance. If
you don’t, people may get hit up again and again by your volunteers,
growing weary of your cause instead of embracing it.
 Encourage everybody to sell first to the people they know. You’d be sur-
prised how many people a single family comes in contact with socially, at
work, and in various settings such as the local gym or school clubs.
 Suggest that sellers keep their sales material with them at all times.
You never know when they will encounter somebody who might buy.
234
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

 Provide some basic sales training. It’s not fair to send a 14-year-old out
into the world to sell without explaining some of the basics, such as
being personable and polite, and how to ask for the sale. Cute will only
get her so far.
 Do everything you can to make the sales process easy for buyers.
Provide order pads, receipts, catalogues, and anything else your sellers
need to make the sales transaction smooth. This includes providing
identification and credentials to your sellers so their customers know
that they are associated with a legitimate organization and selling effort.
Handling the money
You can order products upfront, but before you do you should have a pretty
good idea of what quantities you will need. Especially with perishable food
products, overordering can leave you with a ton of stale cookies (or choco-
late, fruit, or whatever).
One way around this is to use a presale brochure fundraiser technique to avoid
a lot of upfront costs. In this scenario you order brochures from a vendor for
your volunteers to take around to get orders. Give each customer a receipt for
his order, so he has a proof of purchase. When you have your buyers’ cash in
hand, you place the orders. Be sure to advise your customers of how long it
will take to get the items they ordered, so they don’t get annoyed at the
process.
There’s little upfront cost, and you know what quantities to order, so you’re
not stuck with lots of leftover items. The one issue with this process is having
to make two trips to every customer’s home or place of business: one to
order and one to deliver the order.
Check to see if the company you buy from offers a guarantee that allows you
to return damaged products or products you or your customers are not satis-
fied with. You also need to be ready for complaints from customers, just as if
you were a retail store selling a product. Ask a few volunteers to be available
to field these calls or letters after the sale is over.
Be sure that you put a system in place to collect funds and make sellers
accountable. The last thing you need is dozens of people coming to you
claiming they plopped down money for products, when the volunteer never
showed up with the goods. Try to collect money frequently, such as every
few days. The quicker people turn in their funds, the less chance money or
orders will get lost or misplaced. Some companies that sell fundraising prod-
ucts provide you with sales envelopes for accounting for sales that you can
give to sellers. Remember: Your volunteers aren’t professional salespeople
and need all the help you can provide.

Chapter 14: Charging Ahead with Tchotchkes: Giveaways, Gifts, and Sales

Sponsoring a Raffle
Raffles are another labor-intensive fundraising effort because people have to
go door-to-door or stand in shopping malls to sell individual tickets. However,
raffles can make a tidy chunk of change for your organization, especially if the
big prize has been donated. All a raffle costs you in this case is shoe leather
and the price of printing the raffle tickets.
Of course, you can go to a local print shop and ask to get the cost of printing
the raffle tickets donated, as well. Just be sure that you plan to spend money
on promoting the raffle so you can spotlight both the printer and prize
donors appropriately, because that’s what’s in it for them.
Don’t skimp on the tickets. That ticket is all that people are getting for their
$5 or $10, so it should look professional and not like a piece of paper cut into
strips. Always put numbers on your tickets, so people feel that there is some
accountability for their donation.
Finding the prizes
Picking the right prize is the foundation of a successful raffle. It’s the honey
that attracts the donor bees, the lure that gets people to pull that $5 out of
their wallets.
Cars, trips, and electronics are usually pretty popular. The ideal scenario is to
get most prizes donated. To find prize donors, start by asking people who are
already involved with your organization. You may find that one of them owns
a business that may help out or has a contact that can contribute. Here are a
few enticements to offer them:
 Think of all the great tax benefits!
 Piggyback onto our publicity and get your name out there.
 Get people thinking that the best thing in the world would be to win
your [washer] [television] [vacation package] and they’ll transfer their
thinking to your product when it’s time to buy.
Not every prize has to be a car, appliance, or vacation to Hawaii. Offer differ-
ent levels of prizes so people feel that there’s a better chance of winning
something. Try these suggestions for lower level gifts:
 Approach local restaurants for gift certificates. They get free promotion
in your raffle publicity, and may get somebody into their restaurant who
has never been there before who could become a future customer.
236
Part III: Assembling Your Fundraising Toolkit 

 Get the local museum or zoo to donate two free daytime passes.
 Ask for a local B&B to donate an overnight stay at a time of year when
they are usually hunting for visitors.
Another option is to look to your group’s activities for some of your prizes. If
you provide free meals to senior citizens and have some good cooks in your
rosters, consider a gourmet dinner prepared in the winner’s home as a prize. If
you offer transportation to work for people who have no cars, make your prize
a chauffeured shopping trip to a nearby city. Whatever you offer, get creative!
We don’t recommend purchasing a big, costly raffle prize out of your own
bank account. It can be risky, given that you don’t know how many tickets you
will sell. Always look for donations of prizes as the foundation of your raffle.
Understanding the legal and
financial ins and outs
Raffles can involve some legal issues that vary by the state you live in. For
example, in some states you have to sell a certain number of raffle tickets to
give away a pricey item like a car. It’s always a good idea to have some legal
advice and draw up some kind of agreement with the donor of any big prize
before you start selling tickets. Otherwise you could be left holding the bag.
Another important consideration is what you charge for your raffle ticket.
The ticket price should relate in some way to the value of the big prize. Too
much and people can’t afford it. Too little and people think that the prize is
cheap. You also have to think about how many tickets you can realistically
sell before setting the price point.
Don’t be afraid to ask people to buy more than one ticket. Their chances of
winning increase, and extra tickets multiply the results you get from each and
every ticket sales encounter.
Be sure to account carefully for all the income from and expenses of a raffle.
In the end, though people may buy a raffle ticket to get a prize, they are also
handing over their $5 to support your cause and expect most of their ticket
cost to go to your constituency.
Peoplepower is key
Your raffle’s success depends on the number of people who will get out there
and sell tickets. Create personal goals for everybody, and give clear timelines
for selling tickets. Get people excited about the prizes, so they can convey
their enthusiasm. Consider offering prizes (donated, of course) to your volun-
teers for the most tickets sold.
237
Chapter 14: Charging Ahead with Tchotchkes: Giveaways, Gifts, and Sales

Remember to maximize raffle sales by promoting and offering tickets for sale
at various other organization events. If you’re sponsoring a booth at a local
community event, offer raffle tickets for sale there. Don’t forget to promote
the raffle on your Web site (though legal requirements may not allow you to
sell raffle tickets online).
How much time should you allow your people to make their sales goals? You
have to provide your people at least a month, and for really large prizes such
as a car, you might get exposure for your raffle event for two or even three
months before the buying public get restless and wants to know who won.
You won!
Don’t forget to promote the event after the fact. Get more publicity mileage
out of the prize awards by holding a press conference, taking a photo of the
winner driving away in her brand-new car and putting it on your Web site, or
placing a press release about the winners in the local paper. Don’t fail to give
each and every prize away, or your credibility for future raffles may be called
into question.
Also, don’t forget to reward the volunteers who made this low-cost, high-profit-
margin venture a success. Hold a dinner, send out thank-you postcards, or give
them prizes for their efforts. If you do, they’ll be more inclined to help again
with the next fundraising event.

Creating and Using a Web Site
In This Chapter
 Getting your own Web site
 Keeping content current and exciting
 Getting people to come to your site
 Collecting donations online
A
lmost anybody who is anybody seems to have a Web site these days.
And the online exposure is more than just fashion — it can mean a
whole new world of people interested in your mission and willing to help.
The Web is an exciting area for fundraisers — a new (but not the final) frontier.
Each day we find out more about who our Web visitors are, what they are
interested in, and how our organizations can best reach them. We are discov-
ering (sometimes the hard way!) the perks and pitfalls of online technologies,
and how to use our Web presence to the best effect.
This chapter takes you on a speed-of-light tour through various online
fundraising possibilities. We show you how to find out whether you need a
Web site and what kind of site you may need. We show you how to go about
fundraising online. We also tell you who uses the Web for philanthropy (such
as donors who want to give!), and what you need to know about them.
Don’t get left behind — start thinking about how your organization may look
in cyberspace, and see how you can serve your donors better, faster, and
more efficiently by using the Web.
Putting Up Your Own Web Site
The Web is a relatively new phenomenon, as far as fundraising is concerned,
and having a site gives you the opportunity to build the beginnings of an
online community and connect with your donors in new and exciting ways.
But you have to know what the purpose of your site is and how you can get
the most out of it.

Deciding if you really need a Web site
If you’re not already online there are two questions you need to ask before
blasting onto the Web: “Do you need a Web site?” and “Can you build and
maintain a Web site?” The answers will be more than a simple yes or no.
Consider these questions as you weigh the possibility of creating a site for
your organization:
 Does your mission serve people in a large geographic area? The Internet
helps organizations with a widespread donor and client base to overcome
geographic boundaries. Because donors anywhere in the world can
access your Web site, you are not limited to the long-distance phone 
service, the television coverage, or the reach of the post office you may
usually use to get the word out.
 Are your donors likely to use the site? If your donors are primarily
elderly, a smaller fraction of the group may be comfortable with the
technology than, say, young professionals and their families. Of course,
one reason you may be thinking about putting up a site is to attract a
younger constituency. And older individuals are surfing the Web in
greater numbers as the technology becomes faster and easier to use.
People with disabilities are finding that they can connect with others
online when they can’t get out of their homes.
 Would your organization benefit from linking to other groups online?
Some organizations link successfully to larger groups with similar mis-
sions. This sharing of information is considered community building and
is helpful for donors seeking information on specific topics.
 Do you feel you need to give your donors a way to contact you? If you
are aware that a substantial percentage of your donor base uses online
services, the opportunity to produce another point of contact for your
donors is an attractive one. Even if you simply put up a “Here I am!”
site with your e-mail address, donors may be more apt to contact
you by e-mail than by picking up the phone to call you or by writing
a letter.
 Do you have a practical use for a Web site? You may, for example,
include a form that both captures visitor data and enables prospective
donors to order your annual report.
 Do you have someone to create and maintain the site for you? If you
have a Web-savvy volunteer or the money to staff a Web position, great —
but if it’s going to fall on your shoulders to maintain the site, or you aren’t
sure where the help will come from, you may want to consider waiting. If
you don’t have the resources to maintain your site and keep it current it
may make a negative impression on potential donors.
242
Part IV: Leveraging the Internet 

 Do you have a lot to say about your organization? The Web is all about
current information with up-to-the-minute news flashes. If you don’t
have a lot to say, or you can’t produce new information on a consistent
basis, people may visit your site once, but they won’t keep coming back,
except, perhaps, to get your address or phone number. Plan to build a
professional-looking Web site with interesting and fresh content and
then publicize it so people know how to find it.
As a representative of a donor-services organization, you have another ques-
tion to ponder. If you open a Web site, how can you ensure on the Web that
you are who you say you are? Your donors want to know.
Part of the excitement of the Web is also its single biggest liability — the
anonymity of it. Big organizations and small organizations can all look alike.
You can run a nonprofit from your living room with no overhead and nobody
knows the difference. You can respond quickly and easily to donors, trends,
and Inernet events. How do your donors know that you are reputable? If they
donate online, can they be sure that their donation is used the way you say
that it is used? For this reason, building your site while considering what
your donors need to know in order to make informed decisions is a great
donor service. Provide your Form 990s online. Give visitors e-mail access to
staff in your organization. Respond quickly. Give history and photos, as well
as a clear vision of your mission and the need it addresses.
Remember that people are somewhat cautious about online scams and their
personal privacy (as they should be). Be willing to go the distance and then
some, showing your online donors that you mean what you say. Down the
road that will mean better-informed, more-committed constituents, and a
well-developed, useful, thriving Web site.
Understanding how to use your site
If you decide that a Web site is in your organization’s future, here are some
ways you can use it:
 Have a basic site that says that we’re a viable entity, and here’s how to
contact us.
 Introduce visitors to your mission.
 Show pictures or videos of the good work you do.
 Introduce your board of directors.
 Invite visitors to get involved.
 Publish an online newsletter or informational articles.
243
Chapter 15: Creating and Using a Web Site

 Display your wish list of most-needed items.
 Outline how people can get involved as volunteers.
 Ask visitors to sign up for your print newsletter.
 Accept online donations.
 Sell cause-related products such as T-shirts or coffee mugs.
 Provide discussion forums and blogs, so people can engage each other
and your staff on issues facing your organization and society.
 Connect visitors to other sites with information about your cause
through links to helpful information.
For information about setting up and maintaining a Web site, find a copy of
Creating Web Pages For Dummies by Bud Smith and Al Bebak (Wiley).
Does it matter to donors and foundations whether you have a Web site? In a
word, yes. Donors and foundations want to “look you up on the Web” before
they make a commitment with their time and money. We live in the age of the
educated donor, and the Web is increasingly the easiest and fastest research
tool around. Not to mention that having a Web site lends you credibility as a
real entity.
Creating it yourself or hiring it out
Creating and publishing a Web site is getting easier than ever. You can use
popular programs such as Microsoft Word or Publisher to create a Web page
with pretty slick-looking templates. You can sign up with a hosting service
that may provide its own Web-creation tools. You don’t have to be an Internet
geek to create and post a professional-looking Web page.
Whether you design your own page or not, you have to pay somebody to host
it. Hosting services provide lots of useful tools to get you set up with your own
Web site and the cost isn’t always that high. Visit www.web-page-hosting-
review.com to get an overview of some of the many services out there.
The expertise it takes to add in all the bells and whistles for a Web site isn’t
always in your grasp. Designing forms that collect visitor information or
donations can be tricky. Adding links that don’t get broken on a regular basis
takes some know-how. Making sure that animations and videos play in most
popular browsers without a hitch may require some experience.
Only you can decide if you have the resources to make a professional-looking
Web site yourself or if you need to find a professional Web designer. Decide
what you want your Web site to do, what it’s worth to you, and what image
244
Part IV: Leveraging the Internet 

you want to present first, and then do what you need to create a solid Web
presence. Keep in mind that a bad Web image can do more harm than good;
you may have to bite the bullet and pay somebody to set up a basic, nice-
looking site and build on it slowly as your budget allows.
Ask around your volunteers: somebody is bound to be Web-design savvy. See
if a local Web-design firm will do the design work pro bono or give you a break
on the price for keeping a banner ad for their services displayed on your site.
Adding Content and Keeping It Fresh
Putting stuff on your Web site and letting it sit to gather dust for months on
end is not a recipe for online success. Posting content that is boring and out
of date will be equally deadly. Perhaps the biggest challenge to having a Web
site is keeping what you put on it current and worthwhile. How do you do
that? That’s what the following sections explore.
Putting your contact information
front and center
Don’t hide your light under a basket. Many people who come to your site do
so simply to look up contact information. Don’t make them go through pages
of content and scroll down just to find a simple phone number. Put your
phone number and address on every single page. Include a “Contact Us” page
that puts all your contact information in one easy-to-find place, including a
way to e-mail staff members directly.
Finally, do not forget to brand your site. This simply means to put your or-
ganization logo front and center on every page to help create an awareness of
your group that will surface again every time that visitor sees your logo on a
brochure, in a mailing, or posted at an organizational event.
Including information that saves 
your volunteers’ time
One of the real benefits of a Web site is that people can find things there that
would otherwise cost you, either in the form of a printed brochure or a staff
member’s time. Put your events calendar, your facility address, your times of
operation, or anything else that people ask on a frequent basis up there.
245
Chapter 15: Creating and Using a Web Site

Writing content yourself
If you have the bandwidth to write fresh, new materials on a regular basis,
more power to you. But writing online content just intended for online 
consumption is time consuming, especially when you need to refresh it
almost daily.
Try to spread the work around and post articles written by you, other staff
members, board members, or volunteers. Even though you may have to edit
materials for quality, organize a writing effort that involves many people to
keep new ideas and perspectives at the forefront.
Using existing materials
The best bet for keeping online content fresh is to find ways to use materials
you already created for other purposes, perhaps slightly modified for Web
style. Consider these sources:
 Grant proposals describing exciting new projects
 Brochures
 Print newsletter
 Your mission statement
 Fundraising direct mail pieces
 Case studies of people served by your group
 Press releases
 Posters for upcoming events
 Newspaper articles about your activities
 Reprinted letters of gratitude from constituents (with their permission,
of course)
The point is to take advantage of other materials you’ve created to keep your
Web site interesting. How would you modify these materials for the Web?
 Add graphical elements (photographs, animation, or video) or sound.
 Modify their format to use Web-friendly fonts and offer a printable and
downloadable version.
 Keep them briefer, more to the point. People don’t read lengthy docu-
ments on their computer screen, as a rule.
Pulling content from other Web sites
Another way to add interest to your Web site is by adding content from other
sites. There are a few ways to do this. One option is something called a news
feed (a kind of subset of this is called an RSS feed). Essentially you use code
246
Part IV: Leveraging the Internet 

provided by another site to place a feed of their content onto your site. That
way you could display, for example, headlines from a government site on
funding initiatives on your own site.
You can also put links to other sites on your site. This provides a way for
people to jump to another site to read their content, and then return to your
site to keep browsing your content. Though they obtained the content from
somebody else’s site, they got to it through your site, so it psychologically
expands what you have to offer them.
Attracting Visitors to Your Site
What point is there in having a Web site if nobody goes there? After you’ve
made the choice to have a Web presence, and decided how you’re going to
design it, create it, and populate it with information, there’s one more very
important piece to the Web success puzzle. You can let people know about
your site in a variety of ways.
Publicizing yourself
The most obvious way to let people know about your Web site is to note it on
each and every scrap of material that leaves your office. Here are just some
of the places you can note your Web address:
 Business cards
 Brochures
 Grant applications
 Banners for events
 Bumper stickers
 Direct mail solicitations
 Thank you notes
 Volunteer nametags
 Press releases
One very important way to get people to come to your site is to try to
get a Web address (also called a URL) that people can easily guess. If
your name is Parents for Character, an obvious address would be www.
parentsforcharacter.org. But if that happens to be taken by somebody
else, try www.parents4character.org or PFC.org. People often simply
try a logical address in their browser to find you, and the more straight-
forward your Web address, the easier they will find you.
247
Chapter 15: Creating and Using a Web Site

Getting into search engines
Search engines such as Yahoo! and Google help people find Web sites.
However not all searches are equal. Many search engines regularly ‘crawl’
around the Web searching out new sites to include in their index. Most sites
also allow you to submit your site to them, but they do not guarantee how it
will be returned to users of a search. In fact, I searched Google with the key-
words “search engine” and their own name was returned fourth in the list,
after other search engines such as Lycos and AltaVista!
The best bet to having your information show up in searches is to pay bucks
to get the search engines to return your site at the top of a results list or in a
special section of premier results. But if you’re like most nonprofits, you
aren’t likely to have such advertising dollars. So follow these steps to get the
best exposure:
 Submit your URL to as many search engines as you can. Go to www.
searchengineshowdown.com for a list of engines with ratings and 
features.
 Think carefully about the keywords that will return your name in a typi-
cal search. If you are an animal-rights group of course list yourself under
animals, dogs, and cats, but also under veterinarian, pets, and cruelty.
 Try paying a submission service to submit your information to many
search engines at once. Sites such as www.morevisibility.com and
www.wpromote.com are examples of these services.
 Don’t forget to get included in lists of nonprofits on nonprofit informa-
tion sites such as www.charitywatch.org. When people search those
sites for your name, it will pop up.
Adding links to others’ sites
While you’re working with that Web designer to design your site, don’t forget
to have him or her also create an easily distributable link to your site. Giving
others the simple code they can place on their site so people can jump to
your site can bring you lots of traffic. Some sites will post an icon or your
logo for the link, others will just include a text link, your name highlighted in
blue that people can click to go to your site.
Here are some ideas of people or organizations you can ask to link to your site:
 Similar causes in other regions of the country or world
 Sites that are central points for information about your type of cause
248
Part IV: Leveraging the Internet 

 Local organizations or corporations that you work with on a regular
basis
 Media sites such as local newspapers that offer a local nonprofit links
page on their site
If you modify your site address in some fashion, don’t forget to redistribute
new links or provide a way for them to be forwarded from the old link to your
new site. Otherwise, people trying to get to your site will hit a dead end and
may give up trying to find you on the spot.
Collecting Donations Online
There are three aspects to collecting money on your Web site: how will you
get people to make that donation, how will the payments be processed, and
how do you keep your donors’ payment information secure? Here are the
answers to all three questions, in brief.
Making the pitch
If you want to accept donations online, that’s great. You’ll be providing your
donors with a convenient way to support you that they can access 24 hours a
day. You provide a way for people moved by information you provide on your
site to donate right then and there without having to call up anybody to make
a pledge. But you have to set yourself up to promote your online giving.
Be sure to note that on all your print materials that donations are accepted
online, along with the Web address. Even if you’re sending a paper donation
form to somebody, note your Web information on it. Some people not finding
a stamp or envelope handy may decide to give, but be happy to find an alter-
nate way to make the donation.
Make your donation form easy to fill out, navigate, and submit. Also, make
the donation form you post online printable, for those who start to give online
and then change their mind and decide to print the form and mail a check
instead.
Note that you accept online donations on your home page. Make sure that
everybody who visits the site is alerted to the feature, and knows how to
use it.
249
Chapter 15: Creating and Using a Web Site

Setting up the system
Essentially, setting up online payments involves designing an interactive form
that users can easily fill out, and setting up a form of payment. If you already
accept credit card donations, you are pretty much set up to accept credit card
payments submitted online in a manual fashion. You can receive the electronic
form in your office and process the payment along with any others.
If you aren’t set up to accept credit cards you will have to get a merchant ID
and other things in place. Sites such as WorldPay (www.worldpay.com) explain
what’s involved in setting yourself up to accept online credit card payments.
Finally, you can use a payment service such as PayPal (www.paypal.com) to
accept payments from people’s bank accounts with bankcard payments.
Don’t want to go through the hassle of setting up to receive online payments?
Consider using a third-party charity donation site to gather online donations
for you. Sites such as Network for Good (www.networkforgood.org) and
Active Giving (www.active.com/activegiving/) offer a service where they
handle all the donation submission and processing for you.
Keeping payments secure
How you set up to receive online payments is important because you need to
make sure that your site is secure, so transactions aren’t visible to every
Tom, Dick, and Mary roaming around out there. You need to use a network
protocol called Secure Sockets Layer for secure electronic financial transac-
tions. Look for a Web hosting service that provides this option. It’s also a
good idea to post a privacy policy on your site, reassuring people that pro-
tections such as SSL are in place and that you will respect their personal and
financial information and not share it with others.
A current concern of NPOs is the issue of nonprofit registration. For example,
if you are planning to fundraise in the state of Illinois, you need to register
your organization with the appropriate agency in that state. But what hap-
pens when you fundraise online and can reach any and all states at one time?
Do you need to register in every state just in case? Some people say yes, it’s
better to go the cautious route; others say no. We say check with your legal
advisors before beginning a fundraising campaign on the Web. Regulation and
registration on the Internet are changing quickly — be sure, if you intend to
collect money in cyberspace, that you have someone to turn to who can help
you navigate the legal issues.

Getting the Most from E-Mail
and E-Newsletters
In This Chapter
 Avoiding common e-mail mistakes
 Using e-mail effectively to tap into donors
 Creating an e-newsletter that catches donors’ interest
I
n our hi-tech age, you can’t ignore the potential for e-communications.
Many people on the run prefer e-mail to a phone-tag marathon. They can
respond at their own convenience, and it’s often quicker than a phone con-
versation with its social niceties (So, how are you doing today? Nice weather
we’ve been having, huh?). Also, sending information to folks via e-mail or an
e-newsletter is much cheaper (and faster) than buying envelopes and sticking
on stamps. In addition, you can send all kinds of things, from an audio file to
a PowerPoint presentation, in the blink of an eye.
So why hasn’t your organization jumped on the e-communication band-
wagon? Whatever your excuses, this chapter provides the motivation and
information you need to get e-mobilized.
Avoiding E-Mailing Mistakes
Just as the telephone can be used for good or evil (a call from Uncle Charlie,
how nice; another telemarketer at dinner, what an annoyance!) so can e-mail.
So, before you send some kind of online mass mailing, think about what you
will say, whom you will contact, and how these people will perceive your
communication.

Don’t use e-mail to spam
Spamming is the practice of sending out a lot — and we’re talking a lot, like
hundreds or thousands — of unsolicited e-mails in a hit or miss approach to
connect with a potential customer or donor. The people who get spam may
have contributed to or communicated with your organization. They may not
give a darn about your mission to save endangered Equatorial birds. You may
have bought a list of e-mail addresses from somebody who swears all the
people on it are interested in hearing from groups like yours, but that may or
may not be true.
Folks who receive spam at the least will delete it, and at the most will deter-
mine never to do a thing to help an organization that has encroached on their
privacy and inundated them with messages they never asked for.
The option to spamming is to use a well-qualified list of your own or an opt-in
list, which we talk about later in this chapter in the section, “Boning up on
the benefits of opt-in.”
Don’t be a sloppy e-mailer
E-mail may be a quick and easy way to dash off a note to a colleague, but
when you use e-mail to communicate with a donor, you can’t afford to make
your communication sloppy or mistake ridden. Sending a badly phrased or
unclear e-mail is a waste of your recipient’s time. Sending e-mail full of mis-
spellings and grammatical errors sends a message about the caliber of your
organization. Never treat donor e-mail, whether to a single person or hun-
dreds of potential donors, with any less care than you do your organization’s
brochure, annual report, or paper-based mass mailings.
Here are some proper e-mail tips:
 Use spell-checker; most e-mail programs have it, and it only takes a few
seconds.
 Read over your e-mail, or better yet, have somebody else in your organi-
zation read it over before you send it to catch clumsy phrasing or
mechanical errors.
 Keep copies of e-mail content in documents in word processor format.
When you need to edit and send a modified version, just do so in your
familiar word processor program, and then cut and paste it into e-mail
(and you avoid the chance you’ll hit Send before the thing is perfect!).
252
Part IV: Leveraging the Internet 

How to Use E-Mailing Campaigns
The last section told you how not to use e-mail. This section tells you how to
do e-mail right. Here are a few things you should consider:
 Know whom to e-mail
 Know what to ask for
 Know how to structure the e-mail itself
Figuring out who to send the e-mail to
Before you start sending out e-mails willy-nilly, you have to have people to
send them to. There are a few sources of e-mail addresses to consider.
Acquiring addresses of people you know
The first set of people to target with e-mail, the absolutely best-qualified list
of folks to approach, is people who you know have an interest in your organi-
zation. This would include volunteers, past donors, patrons, or members.
However, before you can send e-mail to these people, you have to have their
e-mail addresses. That’s why it’s important that you start good e-mail list
building practices today.
The odds are your donor files, for example, only note e-mail addresses for a
few people. You will have to acquire people’s e-mail addresses over time.
Look for opportunities such as these:
 If you are a nonprofit arts group, add an e-mail address line to the form
people mail in to buy tickets to your next event.
 When you next throw a party to thank your volunteers for their time, put
out a sign-in sheet and include a request for e-mail addresses.
 If you run a raffle to raise money, add an e-mail address line to the raffle
ticket stub.
 If you are chatting with a major corporate donor over lunch, ask for her
business card, which will include her business e-mail address.
You know that a highly qualified potential donor address is worth hard cash
to your group. It’s time to put that same thinking toward the value of an
e-mail address.

Boning up on the benefits of opt-in
One alternative to using a list of people you already know is to buy or build
opt-in lists for your e-mail campaigns. Opt-in means that people have asked
for information from your organization. Not only are these people a richer
potential mine of donor dollars, but also they are less likely to be annoyed
when you communicate with them.
Opt-in lists are created in a few ways:
 When people register on your Web site, they may indicate in the sign-up
form that they are open to receiving information from you.
 You may have a relationship with another organization where their mem-
bers have agreed to receive communications from related organizations
and they share their addresses with you.
 You may buy an opt-in list from another group or opt-in list vendor.
However they did it, opt-in folks have somehow said that they are open to
receiving communications from you.
You can use an opt-in service, such as Spam Alternative (www.spam
alternative.com) to do your opt-in emailing for you. These organizations
have built up opt-in lists from sites such as free e-mail providers, where
people get a free service in return for agreeing to receive advertisements and
promotions. They may even provide tracking services for your e-mailing, let-
ting you know how many recipients actually opened and read the e-mail, and
how many responded in some fashion.
Knowing what to say
An e-mail campaign should be as well thought out as any paper-based direct
mail campaign. Though it may seem less costly to click the Send button after
you have a list of people to e-mail, there is a cost associated in terms of
designing the e-mail content, strategizing its purpose, and following up on the
e-mailing. There can also be a cost to doing e-mail wrong.
Consider your e-mailing’s purpose and desired results before clicking Send.
Some organizations use e-mail to solicit donations, others to maintain their
donor relationships, and still others to find and interact with volunteers. The
possibilities are really endless, but whatever the reason for the mailing,
understand what you want to get out of it before it goes out.
Using e-mail to get that donation
The most obvious use of email for a nonprofit organization is to try to raise
money. E-mail itself is simply words, just like a solicitation letter. But the
Internet harbors some cool technology that goes way beyond a paper letter.
254
Part IV: Leveraging the Internet 

 Include a hyperlink (usually just called a link) in your e-mail. A link is
typically a graphic symbol or bit of text that people can click to go to
your Web site or to an e-mail form to reply to your message. You can even
include a link to a page where they can make a payment right on the spot,
either through your site or a third-party payment vendor such as PayPal.
Make sure that you use a secure technology such as SSL for receiving
payments online and announce loud and clear in your e-mail that donat-
ing online to you is safe. Ask your Web designer about how to do this.
 You can also attach a printable form that people can print out and
mail in with a check. Consider using a format such as Adobe Acrobat,
which anybody using the Adobe Acrobat reader can open. Adobe
Acrobat reader is free software, and you can even offer a link in your
e-mail (www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/main.html) that people
can click to download the reader on the spot.
 You can set up an automated confirmation that sends an e-mail receipt
to the donor instantly. The receipt serves as a tax record, but more
important, it can include an instant thank you and recognition of the
donation that will make your donors feeling appreciated.
 Use graphic images in your e-mail to drive your message home. Show a
picture of your new building, include an image of a group of distressed
teens who you have helped with your programs, or add a graph showing
improved results from your efforts over the past year.
 Consider asking people to forward the donor mailing to other people
they think may be interested. E-mail is easily forwarded, and it’s a
free way to expand your message to other potential donors you don’t
even know.
Using e-mail to build your donor relationship
Beyond the way that you get names to communicate with, consider what
you’re communicating. Don’t constantly hit people with bids for money. If
every e-mail from you is a bid for dollars, eventually recipients will add your
organization to their junk mail list and never read another message from you.
Consider alternating fund raising messages with useful or interesting informa-
tion about your group or your cause to help build your donor relationships.
Use those alternate e-mail communications in the following ways:
 Let them in on upcoming events or changes in your organization.
 Note a milestone in giving levels and thank them for helping.
 Provide a case study of a specific way a person or group was helped by
your efforts.
 Share a scanned thank-you note from a child your organization saved
from homelessness or abuse.
 Acknowledge a special gift or all the people who gave in that month.
255
Chapter 16: Getting the Most from E-Mail and E-Newsletters

Using e-mail to find volunteers
Don’t forget your volunteers, that oft-neglected group of souls who give to
you in the form of time and passion. It is relatively easy and cheap to send
out an e-mail thanking them for their efforts, informing them of achieve-
ments, and singling out people for their contributions.
If you have a big initiative coming up that will need a lot of volunteer hours,
you can also send a sign-up e-mail to past volunteers and those who have
expressed an interest in volunteering.
Structuring an e-mail for results
So what exactly should you put in these e-mails? No matter which group you’re
sending to or what your message is, a well-structured e-mail typically includes:
 A clear and concise subject line: Many people decide whether to read
e-mail by looking at the subject line. If yours is vague it may seem like
spam; if it isn’t inviting the e-mail may get deleted before it is ever opened.
Instead of using a subject like, “Read this immediately!” try “Find out how
you can save a child from abuse.” Be specific, and be compelling.
 An identifier saying who you and your organization are right up front:
People naturally want to know who is talking to them before they are
receptive to the message. State your name, position, and organization
right upfront.
 A focused message: E-mail is usually read on a computer screen, not
printed out and read from a page. Reading on a computer screen isn’t
that easy on the eyes, so long-winded messages are an e-mail no-no.
Keep your message crisp, to the point, and well organized to keep your
reader reading.
 An explanation of any attachments: Don’t bury an important part of your
message in an attachment people may or may not read. Also, because
people are afraid that attachments carry viruses, many may be reluctant
to open one if you don’t assure them that what it contains is legitimate.
One final note about how to write your e-mails: e-mail is not a formal type of
communication. Busy people, who want their information fast and to the
point, read it on the fly. Don’t put people off by having an overly practiced or
wordy style. Be sincere about your message, be to the point, and make your
reader feel comfortable with your communication.
Don’t forget to provide a way to track the results. Assign a campaign code of
some sort to each e-mail so questions or donations coming in as a result can
be attributed to a specific campaign. In that way you can identify which cam-
paigns are most successful and improve your content for future mailings. You
can buy e-mail campaign management software such as e-Campaign from
256
Part IV: Leveraging the Internet 

LmhSoft (www.LmhSoft.com) or the free download of Arial Software’s Email
Marketing Director (www.arialsoftware.com) that will help you do this.
E-mail services such as Vertical Response also help you design your e-mail
with templates and design tools for a monthly fee.
Using the Power of an E-Newsletter
Although a large majority of nonprofit groups have their own Web site, a
small proportion use e-newsletters, which is a shame, because e-newsletters
are a great way to stay in touch and build relationships for your group.
E-newsletters (also sometimes referred to as e-zines) are essentially electronic
documents that you send out via e-mail to those who have subscribed. They
can contain articles, advertisements, and even links to other documents or
Web sites. E-newsletters are typically informational rather than promotional.
People subscribe to an e-newsletter by clicking a button on your Web site, or
a link in e-mail you send announcing the e-newsletter and filling in a form
with contact information.
After people subscribe to your e-newsletter, you can send it out to your list
on a regular basis, such as weekly, biweekly, or monthly. You should also pro-
vide a mechanism for people to unsubscribe, if they want.
Choose the frequency of your e-newsletter mailings with one thing in mind:
how often you can generate truly fresh, interesting content. If people hear
the same stuff from you a few times in a row, they’ll stop reading and unsub-
scribe. Also, keep in mind that the regularity with which you deliver your 
e-newsletter can help you keep your communications momentum going, so
pick a realistic delivery interval and always hit your publication deadline.
Catering to donors’ interests
Be sure that your e-newsletter is of interest to your donors. That means that
you can provide information about your own group’s activities, but also give
them information on general trends in your area, information about what
other groups are doing, events of interest, and so on.
For example, if you are an animal-rights group, don’t just tell your subscribers
again and again about your group and its mission, because that will get old.
Sure, include information about your group, but also include pictures of pets
available for adoption at the local animal shelter, information on the pet parade
coming up at Halloween in a nearby city, grooming tips for housebound cats,
257
Chapter 16: Getting the Most from E-Mail and E-Newsletters

and a recipe for healthy dog biscuits. Your donors’ interest includes your group
and its activities, but they’re more likely to enjoy your newsletter if you
address their broader interests, as well.
Creating your e-newsletter
E-newsletters are typically created with HTML, the programming language
used for Web documents or text that you produce in a word processor.
Although you can simply create a document in your word processor and save
it in text or HTML format, our advice is to get a software package such as
eNewsletterPro from AdComplete or use an online e-newsletter service such
as Constant Contact.
These tools typically include HTML templates, such as the one shown
in Figure 16-1 from eNewsBuilder, predesigned to look attractive and eye-
catching to people using any Web browser. They allow you to insert graphics
and your logo easily. They also include a lot of other tools for e-newsletter
management.

Here are some design tips for an effective e-newsletter:
 Include a masthead that will have information such as the newsletter
name, your organization name and logo, the date, subscription, and con-
tact information.
 Use a typeface that is easy on the eyes. Verdana, for example, was specif-
ically designed for use in Web documents to be read on-screen.
 Use headlines effectively. Grab the reader’s attention, but also make it
clear what the article is about. This saves people time, and people value
their time and expect you to, as well.
 Add graphics and color for interest. Whether it’s an attractive border,
a photograph, or a chart, use a mix of visuals and color to make your 
e-newsletter more attractive and interesting.
 Provide links everywhere. Links can take people to your Web site, other
Web sites, a donation payment form, or more information about the
topic of the article they just read. You can save space in your newsletter
and squeeze more in by putting a summary of an article with a link to a
full article on your Web site that those who are interested can follow.
An e-newsletter is still a newsletter. Rules about using a compelling lead para-
graph to put the important information right upfront and answering key ques-
tions like who, what, when, where, and why apply in writing your article
content just as they do in any form of journalism.
Adding multimedia pizzazz
More organizations are including links to video or are embedding video,
audio, or animation content in their e-mail or e-newsletter communications.
People tend to listen to or watch multimedia content with great interest
because sound and images can sell where words fail to. Do you have a short
259

Software to the rescue
Whether you’re doing e-mail or e-newsletter pro-
motion, don’t forget to check out the latest soft-
ware and online programs to help you automate
things. Getactive (www.getactive.com) and
Memberclicks (www.memberclicks.com) are
examples of Web-based systems that enable you
to produce e-mail and e-newsletters, but also
offer features for managing the larger context of
relationship management and tracking. You can
take advantage of templates, design tools, and
distribution tools that make your e-mail and e-
newsletter life much simpler.

video of your clients receiving help or an arts performance your group spon-
sors? Can you provide an animation explaining the scientific ins and outs of
how your group is working to improve the ecosystem?
And, it’s generally true that those who watch or listen to such messages tend
to be more likely to take action or donate.
Automating e-newsletter delivery
Delivering an e-newsletter is as easy as sending e-mail. But to effectively use
an e-newsletter as a promotional tool, you should get a bit more sophisti-
cated in your delivery methods. The same software packages and online 
services that help you design e-newsletters also typically provide tools to set
up and manage the delivery of your e-newsletter.
Features may include:
 Subscribing and unsubscribing options.
 The ability to personalize the e-newsletter. Using this kind of feature
allows you to include a greeting to the recipient by name in the body of
your newsletter.
 Delivery set up that may allow you to send as many as 20,000 messages
an hour.
 Verification of e-mail addresses. This is useful because sometimes
people subscribe with phony e-mail addresses.
 Management of e-mail lists with import and export features. If your sub-
scriber lists are kept in Excel, for example, this allows you to import the
list of contacts for generating your mailing.
 Tracking features that show how many people opened or clicked on
links in your newsletter.
Some useful e-newsletter tools and services include Exact Target (www.
exacttarget.com), eNewsletterPro (www.eNewsletterpro.com), and
eNewsBuilder (www.enewsbuilder.com). eNewsBuilder’s form for setting
an e-newsletter mailing is shown in Figure 16-2.

tion form at the bottom of each and every e-mail you send out.

Part IV: Leveraging the Internet 

Linking back to your site
One great use for your e-newsletter is to drive people back to your Web site
where you may include a donation form, a volunteer sign-up form, or more
detailed information on your services or activities. Always include a link to
your site in your e-newsletter, or even several links to different areas of your
site related to certain stories.
The first best way to get people to subscribe to your e-newsletter is to include
a button to do so on your own Web site. However, for wider exposure, you
can also get your e-newsletter posted in e-newsletter directories such as
EzineSearch (www.ezinesearch.com) or EzineWorld (www.ezineworld.com).

Extending Your Branding Online
In This Chapter
 Using Web logs (blogs) to generate funding
 Browsing in charity portals and malls
 Publishing information and articles to gain presence
 Showing up in online discussion groups
 Establishing online partnerships
 Being visible on association and special-interest sites
O
ne approach to successful fundraising is to simply get your name out
there and do it in a way that gains the public’s trust and admiration.
The Internet is an excellent way to get some presence for your organization
in people’s minds, often referred to as branding.
Branding is a hot buzzword in business these days, and it is equally impor-
tant to nonprofits. Think of the little kids dancing around the globe in the
Unicef logo, or the bright red cross of (you guessed it) the Red Cross. People
get to know your logo, your name, and your mission, and the next time they
think of giving, they just may think of you.
But extending yourself beyond the borders of your own Web site can have
other benefits. You may partner with other sites to accept donations on your
behalf or sell branded merchandise and give a percentage to your cause.
In this chapter, we explore some of the great online tools you can use to
jump-start your branding, promote your cause, and gather donations online.
Blogging Your Way to Funds
A recent trend in online publishing is something called a blog. (Sounds awful,
doesn’t it?). A blog is simply an abbreviated term for a Web log. Think of
blogs as personal online journals where dozens or even thousands of people
come to comment and debate issues or topics. A blog can contain commen-
tary, responses, links to other sites, photos, or even a personal diary. Blogs

began when journalists in war zones at the beginning of this century began to
publish news or share their thoughts online. Blogs caught on with the public,
and now you can find blogs on practically any topic.
As an individual fundraiser you could consider creating your own blog. You
can visit sites such as www.weblogtoolscollection.com or www.ezsgblog.
com to find simple tools for creating blogs. After you’ve created it, get your
blog listed in blog directories such as www.blogcatalog.com for maximum
exposure. Or spend some time visiting blogs that relate to your area of inter-
est, and post a few of your own comments, sharing the mission and passion
(and Web site!) of your organization with others.
Though blogs began as a kind of grass roots, individual form of expression,
today many companies and organizations are creating their own blogs. For
example the New York Times hosts several online blogs. Charities are not left
out; visit http://donate-things.org for an example of a blog that’s all
about donating cars to charity (see Figure 17-1).
You might also check out a related phenomenon called RSS Feeds. This tech-
nology allows you to create a feed from a blog or other content onto your
Web site. It’s a great way to add fresh content to your own site. Check out
Syndicating Web Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies, by Ellen Finklestein (Wiley).

Part IV: Leveraging the Internet 

What do blogs cost?
The answer is, not a whole lot, except the cost of your time to post content,
monitor the blog discussion, and respond. For example, Eblogger (www.
blogger.com), Google’s blogger service, is absolutely free. It can take as
little as a few minutes to set up a blog. Perhaps the greater cost is in market-
ing your blog. But consider that you can piggyback your blog marketing onto
every other marketing vehicle you use such as brochure or your Web site,
and again, it’s mostly a matter of your time.
How do you write a good blog?
Writing a blog is a little different than writing your brochure or a fundraising
proposal. The idea here is to keep people intrigued and participating. To
that end:
 Post questions that get people thinking and contributing their own ideas.
 Offer statistics about your cause that people may not have been aware of.
 Don’t get into fights with contributors of blog postings because they could
be potential contributors to your cause. Do use their contrary postings as
an opportunity to tell your side of the story professionally and calmly.
Using Charity Portals and Malls
You may think that soliciting donations online means setting up your own
Web site with a shopping cart feature to collect the money, complete with
the ability to process credit cards and send out e-mail confirmations. That
can sound like a lot of work (and possibly expense) to a small group with no
full-time staff. But there are alternatives to this do-it-all-yourself method of
accepting online donations.
Charity portals and charity malls are gathering places for fundraising organi-
zations that let somebody else promote you and process payments. Some of
these sites provide 100 percent of any donations they collect to your group;
others keep a percentage to run their sites.
One of the major changes the Web has made is that transactions are happen-
ing faster than ever. In the for-profit world, you can apply for financing for a
new couch and have approval in 45 seconds. In the philanthropic community,
donors want to make decisions, be presented with giving options, make their
donation, and be recognized for their gifts, all within a very quick timeframe.
Providing them with an efficient way to give online can really help your cause.
265
Chapter 17: Extending Your Branding Online

Entering the portal
Charity portals such as Just Give (www.justgive.com) and Network for Good
(www.networkforgood.com) host donation efforts and provide links to a
wide variety of charities. This service provides a charity with tremendous 
promotional visibility for a small fee. If you pay the fee to be a featured char-
ity, you may get a page of your own that people can find through searching
the site or exploring your category of giving. If you are included on a link page,
you can reap the benefit of many people jumping to your own site to hear your
message direct from the source.
Many of these portals also provide information and services for nonprofits,
such as donation tracking and handling of donation payments. Network for
Good offers an area where you can post calls for volunteers. This site also
provides tools for the people making donations to set up giving accounts
where donors can track a history of their contributions and access links to
favorite charities.
Shopping at the charity mall
Another online opportunity awaits you at the shopping mall. No, not your
neighborhood mall, with its department stores and small specialty stores.
This type of mall is a virtual mall, a Web site organized to sell products
online, from a variety of vendors. When your organization is part of the mall,
a percentage of sales dollars are donated to your group.
Online shopping malls are springing up daily. Before you get involved, check
out the following:

Going, going, gone!
Online charity auctions are a recent phenome-
non. This can be a cool way to raise money for a
particular cause or event. MissionFish (www.
missionfish.com) is one good example. You
can trade on eBay through the MissionFish site.
eBay sellers select a charity to sponsor, and then
a portion of any of their sales goes to that charity.
Donors can go to www.missionfish.com to
see a list of eBay sellers associated with giving.
There is an easy to use sign up process on this
site to get your nonprofit registered with
MissionFish. You will need to provide information
about your 501(c)(3) status, a mission statement,
voided check, e-mail address, and electronic ver-
sion of your logo. And best of all, registration is
free.

 What percentage does the mall take?
 How do visitors find your organization on the mall site? Are they required
to sign in to a nonprofit area? Are all nonprofits displayed on a single
page, so your organization is competing with dozens of others?
 Do you have your own address so that visitors can return to your “store-
front” any time they choose?
As you become educated about your choices, you can determine which mall
arrangement, if any, best fits your mission and online fundraising objectives.
A charity mall such as GreaterGood.com operated by CharityUSA.org (see
Figure 17-2) is a good example. Here people can shop for everything from
clothing to cosmetics, with a portion of their purchases (often up to 30 per-
cent) going to charity. You can also expand your branding by selling products
with your logo or slogan imprinted on them through a charity mall.
If you don’t want to be part of a bigger charity portal or mall, but do want to
accept donations online, consider simply setting up payment services
through a company such as PayPal (www.paypal.com). There are transaction
fees for this service, but they aren’t huge and it’s easy to set up. People just
click a button to donate and go directly to PayPal’s site to pay.

Chapter 17: Extending Your Branding Online

Publishing Online to Boost Your
Branding and Credibility
If you’ve ever written a press release, you know the value of just getting your
name in print. On the Internet everybody is hungry for content to keep their
Web sites fresh and keep people coming back. That’s why they may just 
welcome an article or piece of news about your group. Not only will you get
exposure, but also being quoted as an expert in some arena builds credibility
for you and your organization.
Another great thing about the Internet is that information seldom sits still
on one site. Other sites or search engines pick up articles. People forward
articles to others via e-mail. Putting an article or press release out on the
Internet is like dropping a pebble in a pond: The ripples can be endless.
Getting published
To get content placed online you can follow several approaches:
 Visit sites that are somehow related to your target donor groups’ interests,
and send an e-mail to the Webmaster, using a link on their Contact Us page.
 Check out online versions of magazines or newspapers related to your
potential donors’ interests to see if they include information on how to
submit stories to them somewhere on their Web sites. For example if you
work for a musical performing arts organization, you might check into sites
that cover musical interests, local music performances, or music schools.
 Submit questions or comments that may get published to related online
publications with a letters to the editor kind of feature.
Try using content directories, such as Arcana (www.arcanaweb.com), How
To Advice (www.howtoadvice.com), or Articlehub (www.articlehub.com)
to submit online content that gets exposure on many sites. These sites also
provide e-zine templates and articles about how to write online content to
help you out.
Creating good online content
You’re more likely to get what you submit published if you write good online
content. Here are some tips for doing that:
 Pay attention to submission guidelines. If they say no more than 300
words, don’t submit 350.
268
Part IV: Leveraging the Internet 

 Format the article correctly. Some sites want submissions in HTML,
others in plain text. There are good reasons that they ask for these for-
mats: A proper format saves them time and effort in making your content
look presentable online.
 Make the title mean something. You have to grab attention and the title
of your article may be all that appears in a link a visitor clicks to view
the entire article.
 Use a good text editor and check spelling and grammar. A good editor
for online articles is Ziney Pro (www.softtechsolution.com/zineypro).
Joining Online Communities:
Discussion Groups
A discussion group is an online community that discusses an area of common
interest. Hundreds of thousands of discussion groups are available online,
with topics ranging from schnauzers to special events.
Discussion groups have been around a relatively long time in the short history
of the Internet. But the power of a discussion group to connect with others
and stimulate conversation about topics has not abated. These community-
gathering spots where people post messages are reminiscent of bulletin boards
you find in your office break room or local library. Discussion group conversa-
tions can go on for months or even years and involve hundreds of people.
You can use discussion groups to connect to the fundraising community for
advice, or use them to gain exposure for your group.
Checking out nonprofit discussion groups
You can post comments on fundraising-related sites’ discussion groups to
receive helpful information. How does it work? When you post a message, it
is available in a discussion area to both members and visitors to the site.
People read your message, and may respond with a comment. When you get
multiple replies you end up with what’s called a discussion thread.
You can find many different discussion groups that are already out there, and
more are springing up all the time. Here’s a representative sampling for you
to check out:
 Charity Channel is offered by CharityChannel.com. Click on the
Forum link on this home page to access discussion groups on topics
such as Annual Funds and Development.
269
Chapter 17: Extending Your Branding Online

 AFPnet at www.afpnet.org includes several discussion groups. Go to
the home page and click the Discussions link to sign up and access their
six active discussion topics.
 Soc.org.nonprofit is one of the oldest nonprofit discussion groups. There
are two ways to join: Use a newsreader program to subscribe to their
USENET group; or send an e-mail to nonprofit-request@rain.org with
the word Subscribe in the subject field.
 About is a Web site that provides information about many topics. Go to
http://nonprofit.about.com and click the Forums link. You’ll have
to sign up with a member name and password, unless you want to use
the Guest option to visit and check it out first.
 The Internet Profit Center (http://www.nonprofit-info.org/
npofaq/) maintains an FAQ (frequently asked questions) site where they
gather postings from various nonprofit discussion groups. You can sign up
to get an e-mail whenever a new FAQ is posted.
Promoting yourself through
discussion groups
To get exposure for your group among the donor population, it’s probably
most useful to post comments on sites related to your cause rather than on
fundraising sites. That’s because people who give money to your type of cause
look for sites related to your cause whereas other professional fundraisers
visit fundraising sites. If your group deals with battered women, go to sites
that provide advice or services to those people. If your organization helps to
take care of rescued animals, go to large chain pet store sites, sites that advise
people on what breed of puppy is right for them, or pet food company sites
and see if they have a discussion area.
270
Part IV: Leveraging the Internet 
Discussion group etiquette
When posting to a discussion group, always
make the subject of your post meaningful so
others can easily figure out what your topic is.
Check your post for errors and clarity. Error-
ridden postings are not only hard to read, but
they may also reflect badly on your group. Be
careful what you say: If you are responding to a
negative comment about your group, don’t let
your emotions take charge. Be thoughtful, infor-
mative, and gracious in your reply. Remember,
your comments in discussion groups reflect on
your organization as well as on you. And, an irate
posting can be taken up by somebody and sent
around the world via e-mail or some other vehi-
cle. Do you really want something said in the
heat of the moment to represent your cause?

When you post comments in discussion groups, it’s not good etiquette to
post a self-serving appeal for funds. Instead, try to provide information or
respond to others’ questions in a way that’s useful, and simply include a
quick mention of your group and your Web site address in your message.
Over time, you establish a presence in these discussion groups and people
recognize that your group cares enough to help others out. In turn, they may
wander over to your Web site and help you out with a donation. Remember,
this is community building, not advertising! Discussion group involvement
can be time consuming, but it can pay off in the end.
Instant messaging and chat groups are different from discussion groups in
that the conversations are held in real time (called synchronous in techie 
circles). In a discussion group you post a message and somebody reads it,
perhaps days later (called asynchronous). With instant messaging and chat
groups you send a message to somebody who almost immediately gets it on
the other end and responds.
Partnering Online through
Affinity Programs
Did you ever get a call from a magazine telling you that if you bought a sub-
scription, they’d give $1 to some worthwhile cause? Or, does your local
Walmart offer a program whereby you can donate to computers in local
schools? That’s the basic idea of an affinity program. An affinity program is an
arrangement with a for-profit organization that agrees to donate a certain
percentage of income to your charitable cause.
Excel Telecommunications (www.exceltelecommunications.com) has an
affinity program that gets some attention. This phone service provider
donates a certain percentage of income to participating charities. Other affin-
ity programs are developing daily. Some of the most recent include credit
cards that pay out a percentage to the sponsored nonprofit.
Look into these online malls and affinity programs for even more information
(and check out Chapter 12 for even more of these great sites):

Chapter 17: Extending Your Branding Online

An affiliate program is different than an affinity program. With an affiliate pro-
gram you put a link to another site on your own. When people click the link
to go to the other site, you get a small commission. Affiliate programs can be
profitable, but be sure that the affiliate sites are of good quality and that they
relate to your areas of interest. Otherwise, your constituency will click on
them and be offended, or just plain bored, with the result.
Keep in mind that the affinity groups you partner with want to make money off
the goodwill your name generates, but they offer you an additional fundraising
venue that could be profitable. Consider the character of an affinity group
carefully before getting involved with their program. You are stepping into the
world of commerce with affinity programs, and you do not want a badly or
shadily run business hurting your own group’s image or reputation.
Affinity groups are involved in e-commerce. As a result, the income you get
from involvement in them can be subject to unrelated business income
tax. Check with your lawyer or accountant before signing up for an affinity
program.
Connecting with People through
Association and Special-Interest Sites
Just as in the nonelectronics world, people find people (and organizations) in
different places online. You may find that simply placing links to your site on
other sites that have visitors with common interests is a good way to go.
Here are some typical connections you may want to explore:
 If your group supports animal rights, go to the ASPCA site and People
for Ethical Treatment of Animals and ask to put a link to your site there,
but don’t forget to also contact PetSmart, which has a charity to help
homeless animals, and pet food companies.
 If you represent a health-related group, such as one that works for breast
cancer research, consider any site related to health concerns, as well as
sites directed toward women as a group and medical associations.
 Perhaps your organization is raising funds for the arts. Try the site for
your local arts council, record or bookstore, art supply store, or library.
The point here is that the groups and sites you can partner with are limited
only by your imagination. On the Internet, the rule is constant change; so go
ahead and ask whether a site will add a link to your site; what can it hurt?

ifferent fundraising campaigns are run for different
purposes: Your annual fund supports your daily

along the way. We also take a close look at various types
of funding, including major gifts from individuals, founda-
tions, and corporations and the possibility of making an

 Checking out what annual funds are
 Creating your campaign
 Pulling the campaign together
 Evaluating the campaign
E
veryone is familiar with annual fund drives from the point of view of
someone being solicited — by the local zoo, by churches, and by
schools, for example. Most people who are approached to give have no idea
of the work involved in running the campaign they are being asked to give to.
But putting an annual campaign together from the soliciting side involves a
number of specific steps and a whole lot of planning.
This chapter is where you discover just what an annual fund drive is, what
the ins and outs of creating a successful annual fund campaign are, and how
to effectively evaluate your results.
Understanding Annual Funds
Where major gifts and planned giving may provide much-needed financial
spikes in your organization’s life, perhaps underwriting new initiatives or pro-
grams, an annual fund is typically run to support an organization’s annual
budget, bringing in the money the organization needs throughout the year in
order to fuel its work. An annual fund is often structured to receive ongoing
support and gain a donor base; in that way it is different from a one-time gift
a donor makes to your organization. With an annual fund you are using

pledge cards to secure unrestricted, higher-level gifts that donors can pay
in installments — monthly, quarterly, or annually. Unrestricted means that
you can use the money as you want, to repaint the restroom or stock up on
paperclips; unglamorous, but necessary expenditures. Additionally, donors
may want to be recognized for their gift with a naming opportunity or to be
included in a giving club for donors who contribute within a certain donation
range.
Some big organizations hire fundraising consulting firms to help them deter-
mine whether expanded fundraising expectations are realistic. If you don’t
want to hire an outside firm, go out and interview a whole lot of prospective
donors. Ask them to look at your mission statement and then ask, “Is this
doable? Are our expectations out of line?” Using a focus group in this way
takes a lot of legwork, but the result can be a tested fundraising goal with
a number of people getting on board before the fundraising train leaves the
station.
Your annual fund may be large or small — you may spend weeks or only days
planning it. Either way, the system you develop and the planning you put into
it are closely related — the more well thought out your plan, the greater the
return on your annual fund investment is likely to be.
Annual Fund Buster #1: Plan? What Plan? If you think that you can simply
work toward your annual fund all year long without a specific strategy in
place, think again. Without planning, the funds that do come in will be spotty
and short lived. With a carefully prepared annual fund plan, you know what
you’re spending, how much you anticipate raising, who your key players are,
and how you need to evaluate the effectiveness of the various parts of your
plan after you reach your goals.
Designing Your Annual Campaign
The annual fund is the center of all the fundraising efforts at your organization.
The time you spend planning and implementing an annual fund plan relates
directly to the success of the drive — spend the time now, put the systems in
place, and go about your other fundraising efforts in an organized way. It beats
the socks off of shooting blindly at the wall and hoping a certain percentage of
donors will want to support your continuing efforts.
There are four must-have ingredients for a successful annual fund drive:
 Know your goals.
 Have a well-prepared team.
276
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

 Know which tools to use.
 Evaluate your efforts.
The following sections explore each of these important areas in more depth.
By the end of this chapter, you’ll have the blueprint for putting together a
well-thought-out annual fund drive.
Setting goals
So what do you want to accomplish with your annual fund? Most organizations
rely on their annual fund to bring in the money they need for their standard
operating expenses, plus whatever they need to grow in the areas where
they’ve planted seeds.
You and your board should put together a list of the goals you want to reach
with your annual fund. For best results, you should appoint a development
committee that is willing to devote itself to setting up, carrying out, and eval-
uating the annual fund drive. And don’t forget — your board members should
be givers themselves.
You should include these goals for your annual fund, as well as other goals
related specifically to the mission of your organization:
 Bring in the specific amount of funds to reach the fundraising target goal
(use a Gift Range Chart, as described in Chapter 5, to determine your
giving levels and the number of gifts you need in each area in order to
meet your goal).
 Surpass last year’s budget plus inflation, and add new programs.
 Find new donors and upgrade existing donors.
 Enlist and train a dedicated volunteer corps.
 Identify potential higher-level donors.
Although it sounds easy enough — setting your goal and choosing the right
vehicle to get you there — setting the goal can often be a struggle in organiza-
tions large and small. The reason? You don’t establish your campaign goal in
a vacuum. You need to budget your activities, adding the necessary percent-
age of increase for inflation over last year’s budget — and consider how you
want to enhance your programs.
Struggles may result between the planning committee (“This is the year we
want to add services for the kids with no hair!”) and the budget committee
(“That’s too much of a stretch for this year — let’s try that next year!”).
Ultimately you have a moment of truth when everybody has to come together
and ask, “Can we do it?” In many organizations, that’s a tough moment.
277
Chapter 18: Organizing, Implementing, and Celebrating Your Annual Fund

Reaching a consensus on your fundraising goal is a major part of setting up
your annual fund — and it may take considerable talking, planning, and
reevaluating. It also gives your organization the benefit of returning to its 
mission statement, taking a look at its priorities, and ultimately getting 
everybody working together for the good of the cause.
Assembling your team
In larger organizations, the executive director is in charge of leading the annual
fund effort, with the help of an active board and development committee. In
smaller organizations, the annual fund drive may be run entirely by volunteers.
In churches, for example, a lucky volunteer often gets the lead role in the man-
agement of the annual fund. There’s no particular way to do it — but you want
a person who is aware of your mission actually leading the charge.
Choosing the team leader
As with other types of fundraising campaigns, the person in charge of your
annual fund effort should be
 Passionate about your cause
 Able to see both the big picture and focus on details
 Capable of creating a plan, getting it approved, and inspiring others to
work on it
 Recognized as a person with whom people like to work
 Trained in leadership — either in a volunteer or professional capacity
 Respected by your constituency
Putting your team in place
The fundraising team you assemble will have a direct impact on how well
your annual fund meets its goals. Who will be on an annual fund team?
Your volunteer team may be part of your Development Committee — you
should have at least a member or two represented — and they should be
people who understand and feel passionate about the work that you do.
Important attributes of a team member are:
 Able to communicate effectively
 Good at following through on what they say that they’ll do
 Trained in basic fundraising skills
278
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

Use your board to help identify key volunteers who would be good annual
fund team members.
Creating a successful team
You can help make sure that the time and organizing effort your annual fund
team puts into the project pays off by making sure that individuals have what
they need. Your annual fund has a better chance of being successful if you
make sure that team members have:
 Regular meetings to discuss the goals, strategies, and plans for the
annual fund
 Materials used to compile annual fund publications
 Resources for compiling materials
 Access to existing and former donor lists and donor histories
 Prospecting lists that show how the prospect is related to your organiza-
tion and give some rationale for their ability to pay or their payment level
 A system for easily tracking prospect responses
Choosing your fundraising tools
Because you want your annual fund plan to make the most of your resources
and be effective, take some time to think about the approaches on which you
want to spend the most time. We rank them here, from most to least effective.
Meeting face to face
A national survey by the United Way indicates that seven out of ten people
will say, “Yes” to a request from one of their peers when asked face to face for
a donation. Our biggest problem as fundraisers is that we don’t ask enough
people in person.
In a smaller organization, face-to-face contact may not get the same return,
but it could no doubt get a bigger response than the other approaches. Why
is that? Because, as the old fundraising saying goes, “People don’t give
money to causes. People give to people with causes.” The human element is
extremely important — and a face-to-face meeting gives your donors the easi-
est way to connect with you.
The best people paired for a face-to-face meeting are those who are peers in
the organizational structure. If you send a top-level manager in to talk to a
CEO and the CEO makes a case for the organization, the manager may be left
feeling that his donation or refusal could affect his job down the road. Better
to avoid the situation altogether and select people for meetings based on
their peer status.
279
Chapter 18: Organizing, Implementing, and Celebrating Your Annual Fund

When you are fundraising in the workplace, it’s particularly powerful when a
colleague in your department becomes the solicitor for your cause. This way,
the person doing the asking is someone with whom others have an established
relationship — there is already trust built there. The thinking is, “Oh, well, if
Sarah thinks this is a good organization, it probably is!”
Making personal calls
Actually connecting, listening, and responding to another human being is
the next best thing to being there. A telephone call carries the voice — the
living, real connection of another person. This is something you shouldn’t
underestimate — especially when you are tempted to call that donor back
after business hours so you can simply leave a message on his machine.
(Don’t feel bad — we’ve all done it.)
Your responsiveness in a phone conversation helps build the relationship
with the donor, which helps bring the donor closer to your organization.
Also, experience shows that people have more trouble telling a “live” person
on the phone, “No” than they do ignoring a fundraising letter or a more
impersonal solicitation.
Writing personal correspondence
Personal correspondence means a personalized letter written specifically for
the donor. Of course, mailing experts use technology in such a way that even
a group letter looks as though it was written for a single recipient.
Personal correspondence says to the donor, “You’re important enough to me
that I took the time to write to you personally.” This also, like the personal
phone call, carries a bit of weight in the psychology of “the ask.” The letter is
more impersonal than the call or the visit, however, because the real human
contact is missing. Donors have the option of never opening your letter,
pitching it sight unseen, or misplacing it in a pile of other papers.
A personal letter with a phone call follow-up makes the contact more direct
and alerts you if the letter hasn’t been received. Take the time to write the
note by hand, and you’ll improve your response rate.
Making online contacts
So where does e-mail fit into the picture? Is it as effective as a personal letter?
More so? E-mail contacts that are personalized and are sent directly to the
donor may elicit a quicker response than traditional mail because of their
fast nature. Some nonprofit organizations are conducting huge e-mail cam-
paigns to take full advantage of online fundraising. “Opt-in” e-mail, where
donors give their permission for you to contact them online, helps guard
against charges of spamming (sending out massive quantities of unwanted,
unsolicited e-mail), and provides the donor with a quick and easy way to stay
up-to-date on the happenings of your organization. See Chapter 16 for more
about using e-mail effectively.
280
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

One flaw with e-mail is that it often offers no way for the recipient to take
action. You can ask the recipient to mail in a check, but you provide no 
envelope or pledge form. Often hitting Reply to respond to a mass-produced
e-mail message ends up at a dead-end address. You can improve results with
this format if you do allow e-mail responses to go to a real person, or you 
provide a link to your site where a donor can make an online pledge with a
credit card.
Sponsoring special events
If you can get somebody to come to your special event, you already have a
foot in the donation door. Someone who cares enough to come to your event
is already interested and able to provide something to your organization.
Make sure that you capture all the important data about the attendees at
your special events — from who attends to whom they brought or sat with
and what comments they had about the evening. You won’t have time to run
around with a notebook recording these pieces of information, but noticing
the specifics on your top dozen donors can help you target future fundraising
plans. See Chapter 19 for information on planning special events.
Going door-to-door
As any Avon representative will tell you, cold door-to-door calling is an expen-
sive and time-consuming venture. Of all the “personal contact” options, this
one is the lowest on the ladder in terms of effectiveness. If the prospect opens
the door (and they may not, if you’re holding something that looks like a sales
kit), you need to cover a lot of ground in less than 30 seconds. Can you make
someone see the heart of your organization in that amount of time? It’s not
impossible, but certainly challenging and potentially dangerous if there’s an
unfriendly dog about.
Using direct mail
As we mention in Chapter 10, direct mail is a very sophisticated operation
today because of the ability to buy and sort lists. Going to people who already
know about you, such as existing donors, last year’s members, attendees from
events, or even people who have gone to or are givers to similar organizations,
allows for much more powerful niche mailing. Your direct mail campaign may
include an annual fund mailer (maybe in the form of a membership renewal), a
brochure, postcards, newsletters, or catalogs.
Any time you do a mailing, whether of an annual report or a thank-you letter,
it’s good practice to include another solicitation envelope. Change your
appeal but make the most of every contact.
Telemarketing
As we note in Chapter 13, call centers are still going strong as a vehicle in
fundraising. It’s a safe bet that telephone soliciting will become less and less
effective, however, as more and more people use call-blocking devices (such
281
Chapter 18: Organizing, Implementing, and Celebrating Your Annual Fund

as Caller ID or more sophisticated filtering techniques) to weed out the calls
they don’t want. One online survey reported that 98 percent of 1.78 million
people responding were made angry by telemarketing calls. In general, con-
sumers want more control over who contacts them; for that reason, over
time, telemarketing will become obsolete.
Getting on TV and radio
As you may have seen, TV can be an effective means of generating support.
The tsunami in Indonesia brought an outpouring of support that was fun-
neled through the American Red Cross. Television and radio also give a sense
of authenticity (whether that’s warranted or not is another matter); viewers
and listeners often think that if they see it or hear it in the media, it must be
true. Television and radio can be a great friend to your mission. Particularly if
you have a noteworthy cause that has ties to current issues and events, you
can use that exposure to help gain recognition for your organization, which
translates directly into more dollars raised for your cause.
Media such as radio and TV is expensive, and often prohibitive for nonprofit
budgets. Try instead to get human-interest coverage on local cable channels
or place stories in news programs. Or try a prerecorded online broadcast
from your Web site. It’s free, and reaches many of the same people as adver-
tising does.
Rating your organization
Does your organization have all these items in place? In Table 18-1, we present
a way to rate yourself that encourages you to think about each of these areas
and rate your organization on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 is “We haven’t even thought
about it yet!” and 10 is “Been there, done that, and it’s working great!”)

Annual Fund Buster #2: Bad timing. Evaluating where you are in the fundrais-
ing cycle is important before you embark on a planned annual campaign. Is
your board ready? Do you have leadership for the campaign? How experi-
enced are your volunteers? Do you have the budget? These and other issues
can have a lot to do with the success of your campaign — or the lack of it.
Putting the Plan in Place
After you’ve identified your goals, chosen your team, and evaluated the
fundraising tools at your disposal, you are ready to get down to work. The
first step is to identify prospects. Then you need to make sure that you have
the materials you need for support. Finally, you need to ensure that your vol-
unteers are trained and ready. After all that is done, you’re ready to launch
out into your community and begin your annual fund drive.
Understanding your approach:
Donor research and planning
The annual fund campaign targets three types of donors:
 Prospects who have never given to your organization but have interests
or involvements that make them qualified candidates
 One-time donors who can be approached for a repeat gift
 Repeat donors who can be upgraded to a higher-giving level
283
Chapter 18: Organizing, Implementing, and Celebrating Your Annual Fund

Use the donor research strategies in Chapter 6 to find out more about the
specifics of researching your donor audience.
Schedule at least one prospect brainstorming session with your annual fund
team and selected board members. Everybody should be ready, willing, and
able to come up with names of potential donors that the annual fund team
can use.
One of the items you should research during this phase is the percentage of
people helped by the work that you do. Specifics ring true in the mind of the
donor. For example, saying, “Your donation of $150 last year helped us warn a
classroom of 30 preteens about the dangers of smoking” is much more effec-
tive than a simple thank you.
Choosing your materials
What will your annual team members need to support them in their donor
contacts?
 Brochures: Brochures, flyers, or other publications explaining your
annual fund. Also, provide any ID pieces your organization uses to pro-
mote itself and explain its programs. If your organization publishes an
annual report, give it to your annual fund team members to help them
understand what the funds are used for during the year.
 Your case statement: The all-important case statement (see Chapter 3)
gives a clear picture of your mission and explains why you — and only
you — can offer the services you provide in the way that you provide
them.
Come up with a new case statement for each annual fund you do.
Nobody wants to see the same information served up year after year.
The donations from the previous years should be making some differ-
ence, after all. Tell donors how their donations have helped and how
you plan to use this year’s donations. Be sure that you communicate the
continuing need — and your unique response to it — with enthusiasm
and interest.
 Donor information sheets: Your annual fund team members also need
information sheets on donors giving them donation history and pertinent
background information. These sheets are in addition to the donor list.
 Pledge cards: Givers to an annual fund often like to break their gifts into
installments, which makes it easier for them to give larger amounts and
makes it easy for you to allocate income out through the balance of your
fiscal year.
284
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

Annual Fund Buster #3: An uncommitted board. A lukewarm board isn’t
going to bring in large checks — and it also isn’t going to be able to do the
day-in, day-out follow-up required to run an effective annual campaign. Be
sure that your board understands its role in the fundraising function of your
organization before you launch an annual fund drive.
Evaluating (and Celebrating)
Your Annual Fund Drive
Going through a debriefing process can be helpful not only to give your
annual fund team some closure, but also for next year’s team, providing 
information on what worked, what didn’t, and where improvements could
be made.
Your evaluation of your campaign can include the following questions:
 Did we meet our financial goals?
 Did we meet the goals we had for the number of prospects and donors
contacted?
 What was our response rate in direct mail and telephone solicitation?
 Which fundraising tools were most effective?
 Was our team prepared and provided with the tools they needed?
 How effective was our annual fund leadership?
 What were the three biggest factors in the success of the drive?
 What were the three biggest challenges we faced?
 If we were starting this campaign again today, what would we change?
After you finish your evaluation, don’t forget to take time to celebrate!
Celebrating is an important part of the annual fund process. You need to
thank all your volunteers, recognize extraordinary efforts, and praise people
all around. After all, the seeds you plant today may germinate and grow into
the annual fund team you have tomorrow.

Planning a Special Event
In This Chapter
 Maximizing the benefits of special events
 Planning your special event
 Evaluating the event
 Organizing an online event
 Recognizing those who helped
W
hen you say “special event,” people often think of black-tie, high-
society events with fancy catered food and a fine orchestra. Although
this type of event certainly exists and is held regularly (and with finesse) by
major organizations, this type of event is by no means the most common spe-
cial event that nonprofits host.
Put simply, a fundraising special event is an experience that brings people
together and raises awareness for your cause and offers an opportunity to
ask for donations. The event could be anything from a celebrity car wash to a
walk-a-thon to a kissing contest to an evening of ballroom dancing.
Consider the following sampling of special events:
 A Jog-for-Health event that raises money for prenatal care
 A dog wash for the local humane society
 A gala event for the chamber orchestra
 A silent auction for a private school
 A Thanksgiving feast at the homeless shelter
 A black-tie auction for a local arts group
In this chapter you discover how a special event, done well, can raise visibil-
ity for your organization that can mean substantial fundraising bucks down
the road. The key is to have a person who wants to champion the event, a
committee that plans and executes it, and enough time to find the right event
and pull it together.

Whatever the activity, the appeal of the event for your participant is in the
opportunity for belonging, and the fact that the activity is something the poten-
tial donors see as a social activity that sounds like a fun use of their time.
Benefiting from the Event
The single biggest benefit of a special event is raising awareness. Through
your publicity efforts — and hopefully by word of mouth — people in your
community become aware of your organization. Raised awareness benefits
you in a number of ways:
 Increase prospective donor list
 Involve donors as volunteers, forming a closer relationship with your
organization
 Media coverage
 Fundraising, depending on the type of event — expensive events may
yield less financial gain
How big does your special event need to be? Only as big as your budget and
community supports. Because the focus of a special event is more about
building awareness, the selection of the event itself is more important than
the money spent.
Planning, Planning, Planning!
As with most things, the secret to a good event is in the planning. If you want
your event to be truly “special,” detailed and thorough planning is a must
because your results could be sunk by a single misstep. If you’re ready for
the event and do it well, you maximize awareness in your community, build
goodwill with your volunteers, have fun, and raise money. If you’re not ready,
an event that unravels can give the community the impression that your
organization doesn’t manage itself well, which can be a devastating percep-
tion for agencies trying to build credibility.
Planning your special event involves making a number of decisions right at
the start:
 Who takes the lead? Which volunteers serve on the committee?
 What kind of event do you have? Who does it reach? How do you reach
them?
288
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

 What do you want to accomplish? Are you raising awareness, money,
goodwill, or all three?
 Can you afford to do a special event at this time?
Some events become annual events and grow precisely because they are
annual events. For example, some organizations have an annual silent auction
or dance. The anticipation and repeat promotion of the event from year to
year helps the community recognize the organization and the cause.
Putting together the best team
The right leader (one who is enthusiastic, engaging, persuasive, and passion-
ate) can energize your volunteer group. People want to help, and the event
becomes a major team-building activity.
With the wrong leader — someone who looks at the event as a chore, some-
one who is already overcommitted, lacking the time or energy to take on
another duty — the event looms as a continual albatross around the neck of
your organization. Postpone your plans for a special event until you have just
the right leader to forge ahead with heart and soul. A lukewarm event drains
your organization’s financial and volunteer resources and becomes a negative
experience that nobody wants to associate with.
Select a committee chair who
 Has the time to commit to the effort
 Has people skills to motivate others
 Understands and is able to communicate the vision
Your special event committee should consist of volunteers who
 Love to get out there and promote your cause with enthusiasm
 “Get things done”
 Can work as a team to pull the event together
Provide enough lead time before the event (see the section, “Setting a time-
line for your special event,” later in this chapter). The committee should
meet monthly at first to solidify the plan and keep it in motion. As the event
draws near, the committee may meet weekly to ensure that all aspects of the
event are under control.

Chapter 19: Planning a Special Event

Selecting an event
The type of special event you choose is also important. Is the event itself linked
logically to your organization’s mission? Will the people who care about your
cause sit up and take notice of the event? An event to benefit a street outreach
group for homeless teens makes sense as an informal, outdoor concert with
casual attire, sidewalk vendor foods, and local bands. That same event, done in
a ballroom with people dressed to the nines, will leave your donors wondering
why the funding of this high-priced event isn’t going to your constituency,
instead. But if you’re fundraising for the opera, a black-tie affair fits your poten-
tial donors’ interests and net worth.
Especially for smaller organizations, the perception raised by the fundraising
event you choose is an important consideration. If you are a small group that
makes quilts for AIDS patients, people may wonder how you could host a
$150-a-plate dinner with high-profile entertainment (unless, of course, the
event is heavily sponsored, which we get to in a minute). Be sure that the
message you send to your participants fits the message you want to send;
don’t leave them wondering whether the money they donate to your cause
goes to fund that annual fundraising gala.
Here are some guidelines for choosing the right event:
 Look for an event that is a logical fit with your organization’s mission.
 Think about who you want to attend — and why.
 Know the return you want from the evening.
 Consider how you can get exposure from the local press for the event.
 Be aware of the budget for special events and stay within your means.
Involve the people you serve in your special event. One mental health associa-
tion nearly always includes in the audience people who have received their ser-
vices. At first other audience members did a double take to see clients in the
audience, but the inclusion of clients in the celebration shows that the organi-
zation means what it says about the rights and dignity of those they serve.
Deciding the where and the when
After you select the event leadership and the event itself, you need to decide
where and when you want to have it. The “where” should also be logically
connected to your organization. Why have a school special event at a loca-
tion other than the school? The “when” should be selected after careful delib-
eration on the wants and needs — and schedules — of your target audience.
Here are some questions that can help you answer the “when”:
290
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

 What time of year fits logically with your organization’s mission? A pro-
gram that raises donations for holiday gifts for kids may have its special
event the weekend after Thanksgiving, when the holiday buying season
officially begins.
 What else is going on in town at that time? What other obligations may
your audience have? If you schedule your fundraiser when the big city
orchestra hosts its black-tie ball, you may lose some of your higher-level
donors.
 Do you know of a time of year when you’re likely to get more help than
others? If many of your volunteers go to Florida for the winter, you may
wind up having that Valentine’s Day dance all by yourself. Remember
that your volunteers are an important part of the overall success of the
event — both for the word-of-mouth publicity they offer and the team-
building experiences they have.
Equally important may be the where. Ask yourself these key questions:
 Where in your town can people get to easily and park near? Logistics can
kill your event. If people can’t get to the event easily, they won’t come.
 What locale fits the event? If you’re throwing a black-tie event, it can’t be
at a soup kitchen in the inner city. If your event involves art, a museum
or theater makes sense. Make sure that the venue matches the mood
and is a destination that is attractive to your potential donors.
 Is the location in your budget? Renting a swank country club for a black-
tie event might be swell, but can you afford it? Your potential donors
don’t want to see you bleeding money for the sake of a fundraiser. Look
for people to donate a locale or swap it for free, positive publicity.
Setting expectations
Clearly, making a mountain of money isn’t a realistic expectation of your first
fundraiser. When you get your special events committee pulled together,
spend some time discussing and carefully thinking through the goals for your
event. Realistic goals help you set a realistic budget. How will you measure
your success? You may want to set goals in each of these areas:
 Number of people attending
 Cost per person
 Coverage in the local media
 Number of volunteers involved
 Amount of money raised
 Happiness quotient
291
Chapter 19: Planning a Special Event

Happiness quotient? How can you rate people’s happiness with the event?
Simple. Set a scale of 1-5. People with a happiness quotient of one left the
event looking seriously bored or disgruntled. People with a happiness quo-
tient of five left euphorically happy, singing the praises of your organization
all the way down the walk. Include volunteer and staff reactions in the happi-
ness quotient too. The 1-5 scale is not a scientific method of tracking event
results, but the “good feeling” that results from a successful event may be the
single biggest lasting effect your efforts make in the year to come.
Budgeting for the special event
Don’t forget the budget. Even if it’s mainly to generate awareness and goodwill,
the event shouldn’t break the bank.
If your organization has a history of special events, you probably already
have a hefty allotment for this year’s event. If you are putting on a first-time
event or are trying a new event that presents new costs, you need to be mind-
ful of the upfront investment involved in setting up services and reaching
your target audience.
As your special events committee works with the budget, be sure to prepare
for expenses in each of the following areas:
 Facility (rental fees, insurance, permits, lighting)
 Equipment (tables and chairs, audio-visual equipment, tents)
 Services (catering, housekeeping, transportation, security)
 Entertainment (speakers’ fees, performers’ fees, bands)
 Publications (invitations, flyers, posters, tickets, banners, thank-
you cards)
 Decorations (table centerpieces, flowers, balloons)
 Recognition (gifts, cards, discount tickets, plaques, pins)
Remember, even if you do have a healthy budget for special events, you don’t
have to use all of it. Try to attain sponsorship for as many components of the
event as you can — from the napkins to the catering to the limo service for
your entertainers. You may be able to get a single corporate sponsor to
underwrite your entire event, or you may be piecing together sponsors for
each step along the way. Be sure to reward their generosity with acknowledg-
ments in your publicity and at the event. Whether your sponsors are one or
many, they are worth the time, research, and effort it takes to cultivate them.
A low-level sponsor now, treated well, may turn out to be a major sponsor
and part of a long-term alliance down the road.
292
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

Setting a timeline for your special event
How many months in advance do you need to plan your special event? If you
can begin a year early, do it. Many organizations begin planning for next year’s
event the same day they evaluate the one they just had. If you do a repeat
event every year, this is a fairly simple process. If you’re starting from scratch
and putting together a new event, you need all the time you can get.
Suppose that you’re going to put on a gala, with catered dinner, a speaker, and
dancing. You hope for the black-tie and evening-gown crowd. If you process the
staging of the special event, you can break the pieces down into a timeline that
helps you stay on track and get everything done in a comfortable timeframe.
The timeline presented here is for a special event that will occur in July of the
next year:
 August: Begin planning; select committee; hold your first committee
meeting; select the speaker and theme. Follow with monthly committee
meetings (with more frequent meetings as you get closer to the event) to
keep the momentum.
 September: Divide tasks among the committee. Contact the speaker.
Determine the location and equipment needed. Remember to consider
permits, security, and insurance.
 October: Draft the agenda for the evening. Be specific, writing down what
you want to happen from start to finish in 15 to 30-minute increments.
 November: Identify potential sponsorships and create a plan to pursue
them.
 December: Identify potential participants from your donor list and the
community at large. Begin to pursue sponsorships.
 January: Contact foodservice, housekeeping, and entertainment vendors.
 February: Approve the menu; select the music.
 March: Print invitations, flyers, and tickets. Finalize your publicity plan.
 April: Do a reality check.
 May: Start publicity; organize your volunteers; send invitations (the last
week of May).
 June: Coordinate all elements of the event; assemble groups; practice a
run-through; do a last-minute function check of the facility: housekeep-
ing, service, sound system, and entertainment.
 July: Put on the Event! Don’t forget follow-up activities such as sending
thank-you notes to volunteers, hosts, and donors, and beginning to lay
the groundwork for next year’s successful event.
With sufficient time and detailed planning, your event should come off with-
out a hitch. Relax and enjoy it!

Chapter 19: Planning a Special Event

Recognizing Success
The place is empty. Confetti covers the floor; dishes and flatware and crumpled
napkins cover tabletops. Soon the crew arrives to disassemble the furnishings
and the tent. It’s all over.
The result of special events can be all over the board, and the amount of
money you raise in your special event may turn out to be secondary to the
goodwill you generate. Because goodwill is hard to rate, you may walk away
from the event wondering whether you hit your mark.
You can use the goals you set to help you determine whether you reached
the desired objectives. You can also watch for longer-term positive results by
being alert for the following:
 People are smiling as they leave.
 Your event is mentioned — in a positive way — in the paper in the 
morning.
 People mention to you that they heard about your event.
 You get an increase in calls and/or visits.
 People signed the guest book to get on your mailing list or filled out a
pledge card at the event.
 You feel that the community has a better understanding of who you are.
 Participants send thank-you notes.
 People ask you whether you plan to have the event again next year.
When the dust begins to settle and you have recovered from the stress, take
more time to evaluate your event. Learning from this one can help you run
the next one more smoothly. Here are some of the questions that you — and
your special events committee — can ask as you evaluate:
 Did we meet the goals we set in the beginning?
 What kind of publicity did we get?
 How many new people did we reach?
 What was our per-plate (or per-participant) cost?
 Did we raise any money?
Is it possible to have a good event without raising any money? Yes! Although
you may put on your special event with the objective of raising substantial
294
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

funds, the more direct benefit is the exposure that you get and the awareness
you raise. The money comes, over time, as a result of these other increased
benefits.
Same time next year? Depending on whom you ask, some event planners
feel that it’s important to have the same event several years running to help
“brand” the event in the mind of the community. Although this approach
works well for some organizations (especially those who know that they have
selected an event that fits well with their mission), an argument can be made
for not repeating an event that clearly didn’t work. If your event was a royal
flop, don’t buy into the argument that you really need to give it three years
before you see any kind of return on your investment. In general, a good rule
of thumb, especially for organizations on a shoestring, is to do more of what
works and do less of what doesn’t.
Organizing an Online Event
These days it’s possible to hold interactive events from your Web site. You
can hold a seminar where you present information about your cause that
interests your donors. Or you can hold an online event with a special draw,
such as a celebrity chat where attendees can submit questions and watch
and hear the big name respond in real time.
Online events won’t be as splashy as a black-tie dinner, but they are virtually
free ways to keep your name in front of people on a much more regular basis.
Using online seminars to inform 
and persuade
Does your organization collect funds to save the rain forest? What about giving
an online travelogue presentation about the rain forest and its various birds
and beasts? Are you an arts group preparing for your Christmas show? Create
a mini-documentary about the behind-the-scenes work at rehearsals and share
it with your volunteers and donors.
Using a video camera, presentation software, and a volunteer with a good
presentation presence you can prepare informational online broadcasts
that people can play back at their own leisure next time they visit your site.
Complete the program with a pitch for funds and a link they can hit to make
their donation then and there. Consider including a mention of this broadcast
in your next e-newsletter or e-mailing campaign directing people to a link on
your site they can click to play back the event.
295
Chapter 19: Planning a Special Event

Chatting online with celebrities
If there’s somebody with a big name who you can get to support your cause,
but who doesn’t have the time to travel to an offline event, consider setting
up an online chat. This format allows you to get a famous name associated
with your cause to chat with your donors online. Designate somebody as a
moderator and, if possible, allow visitors to request an audio recording or
transcript of the chat when it’s done. When you send them the saved chat,
include a pitch for a donation.
It’s beyond the scope of this book to go into the technical ins and outs of set-
ting up online meetings and chats, but trust us; it’s not that difficult to do. Go
to the online expert in your organization, or ask a local Web design group to
donate their time to set it up for you. With a simple-to-use online meeting prod-
uct such as NetMeeting from Microsoft, you’d be amazed at what you can do.
Saying “Thank You!”
Do you think that you want to do another special event next year? Then don’t
forget the last step! Say, “Thank you!” to all involved. As anyone who has ever
been through a special event can tell you, the “thanking” is no small feat. It
requires your heart-felt recognition for the various parts of the whole, from
the person stuffing the invitation envelopes to the catering manager to the
volunteer who desktop-published the flyers in her spare time.
How do you thank participants? Here are a few ideas (remember that the
ladder of effectiveness ranges from personal contact to impersonal contact;
but the biggest “thank you” comes from you, personally):
 A personal visit to the volunteer to say, “Thanks!”
 A phone call and a follow-up letter
 A personal letter to the helper
 A “thank-you” luncheon for all involved
 A group “thank you” in the next agency newsletter (this is a good idea to
do in conjunction with another form of recognition)
It’s easy to leave out a name or two in your thank-you list, but not acceptable.
As you go along, make sure that everyone involved in the planning keeps a list
of people who have helped throughout the planning for the event. Then when
it’s all over, just pull out your list and go through the thank yous, one by one.

The Capital Campaign
In This Chapter
 Deciding to run a capital campaign
 Designating who should lead your capital campaign
 Following through each step of the campaign
W
hen you think growth, think capital. Capital means big money, enough
to build a building or provide income for your programs for many
years to come. A capital campaign is the biggest campaign your organization
can ever undertake. This campaign is a massive, all-out planning effort to
secure large amounts of money for a specific purpose.
This chapter gives you the basics of planning and implementing a capital
campaign — the Big Kahuna of fundraising campaigns. Of all the advice we
can give you on this topic, here’s the most important: Be sure that your orga-
nization is ready for this step; a premature capital campaign may do more
harm than good. Better to organize a capital campaign when you can reach a
meeting of the minds between fundraisers and planners and when you’re
strong and sure; then you’re almost guaranteed success.
Gearing Up for the Big Campaign
Generally, the capital campaign is the one you use to bring in special funds
over and above your operating budget (which is the money-eating animal that
gets fed by your annual fund). A capital campaign raises the funds for the new
wing of your hospital, the new program for teen mothers, or the funding of an
endowment that supports the chair of your Philosophy department.

Most capital campaigns share the following characteristics:
 The campaign encompasses a massive, organized fundraising effort.
 The campaign is designed to raise a specific amount for a specific need.
 The campaign cycle stretches over a long but specific timeframe.
 Lead gifts make up half of your fundraising goal. Lead gifts are dependent
on face-to-face solicitation. (We talk more about lead gifts later in this
chapter in the section titled, “Identifying lead gifts and challenge gifts.”)
 Donors pledge large gifts to be paid over a multiyear period.
Big gifts create big names. Not coincidentally, big names create big gifts. Use
naming opportunities to attract and recognize your high-level givers, giving
them a publicized stake in your organization’s mission for today and tomorrow.
And just think — each time your high-level donors come to visit their name-
sake building, they are reminded of the importance of their generous gifts.
Like ice cream, capital campaigns come in several common flavors, which the
following sections describe:
 Bricks-and-mortar campaigns
 Endowment campaigns
 Project campaigns
 Combined campaigns
Running a capital campaign every year is the fundraising equivalent of forc-
ing your giving well to run dry. Capital campaigns should be, by their nature,
rare. That’s why making the decision to run one should be very carefully
thought out.
Building bricks-and-mortar campaigns
The bricks-and-mortar capital campaign is probably what most people think of
when they hear the term capital campaign. A bricks-and-mortar campaign
raises money for tangible things, such as a new wing for your hospital, a new
school, a new library, or improvements to a community center. Whether
you’re renovating an old structure or building an entirely new one, a capital
campaign brings in the high-level funds you need to meet that goal.
Many funding entities these days exclude bricks-and-mortar capital cam-
paigns from their giving agenda. Check to see whether a foundation or other
source of money is receptive to a capital campaign proposal before you
bother to write it up.
298
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

Raising funds before a building is built is much easier than raising funds to pay
for it after it’s built. The reason? People love to be part of a building dream.
Checking out endowment campaigns
You can also consider an endowment campaign as a variety of capital cam-
paign, but it’s one in which raised moneys are used to invest in your future,
instead of in a building. With an endowment, a donor pledges a substantial
gift that is given over a period of several years; sometimes the interest from
such a gift can sustain a program over several years. Many of the grantor
foundations were built through an endowment of their own. This type of gift
typically goes into a fund for ongoing support of specific programs.
Endowments (gifts left to organizations upon the death of a donor who had a
special relationship with the organization and was capable of giving at a high
level) are often the result of planned giving instruments or bequests.
The one thing endowments have in common is the requirement that they be at
a high enough level to generate income from the principal. This can be done
in different ways. One form allows organizations to make use of the interest
earned each year on the endowment balance. In another form, an endowment
might allow organizations to draw down on the endowment by a certain
amount each year. In both of these examples, you need to start with a substan-
tial sum in order to make the impact of the endowment meaningful. For exam-
ple, the interest on a $50,000 endowment may only yield $1,000 to $5,000,
depending on how it’s invested. Certain costs associated with maintaining a
small endowment could eat up whatever small payoff it provides year to year.
Putting together project campaigns
A project campaign raises funds for a program that requires a specific amount
of money for a specific time — it’s also a type of capital campaign, but one
with a narrow focus. For example, suppose that you are currently serving 15
teenagers in your teen parenting program, and you need to increase that
number to 25. In order to do this, you need more physical space, more funds
allotted to the annual fund, more program materials, and more personnel.
You can use much of the planning you do for a capital campaign to accom-
plish your goals in the more focused project campaign.
Running combined campaigns
If you want to see a combined campaign at its finest, look at any major univer-
sity. Universities are quickly mastering the techniques for weaving together
the goals of a combined campaign. A combined campaign orchestrates all
299
Chapter 20: Building Buildings, Nonbuildings, and Futures

your needs in a single plan — bricks and mortar, program goals, equipment,
even the annual fund may all be interwoven with the overall combined cam-
paign goals.
Selecting a Champion
In any capital campaign, leadership is everything. The person you select
to head the campaign can often makes the difference between achieving
your goal and falling short. The successful capital campaign is a thoroughly
planned event that requires a leader with vision, experience, and the connec-
tions and means to secure the highest-level lead gifts possible. (Lead gifts are
major pledges that come in early and really start your campaign rolling. We
talk more about them later in the section titled, “Identifying lead gifts and
challenge gifts.”)
The best approach is to select a general chairman for the capital campaign
committee from your board. You also need dedicated volunteers to serve on
the committee as well. As you begin to select committee members, consider
these characteristics:
 Commitment to the mission of the organization
 Position in the community
 Experience with the organization
 Ability and willingness to give
Each of these characteristics is vitally important. In a capital campaign, each
of your board members must be a giving member. The members of the capital
campaign committee will have more credibility if they are able to back up
their requests with their own giving experience when they go face to face
with potentially high-level donors. The ask, as we explain in Chapter 9, is
more powerful if, when your committee member invites Bob to make a dona-
tion, she can say, “Bob, our board consists of 14 members, and we have each
contributed between $3,000 and $50,000.”
You may need to organize more than one committee to take care of each step
of the campaign process because the planning and implementation of a capi-
tal campaign involves so many tasks.
Before you launch the capital campaign, you may want a capital planning
committee to evaluate the institution’s readiness for a capital campaign.
This committee may hire an outside firm to do a feasibility study, and may
also identify and cultivate prospective high-level givers. The study report
is addressed to your leadership, and your campaign committee makes any
decisions necessary to implement the plan.

Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

Staging the Campaign
Planning is a particular priority in a capital campaign because of the cam-
paign’s sheer scope. Don’t start before you’re ready, or it will show in the
results.
Planning for a capital campaign usually involves the following stages:
1. Readiness: Determine whether your organization is really ready to launch
a capital campaign. You can do this yourself or use an outside agency to
make sure that your basic fundraising structure is in place and functioning
before taking on anything this massive and this public. The outcome of
your capital campaign, whether you pass the goal with flying colors or fall
flat on your face, can have an impact on the public perception of your
organization for years to come.
2. Testing: Identify key potential donors of influence in your area and get
their opinions on the readiness, practicality, and appeal of your campaign.
3. Setup: Put in place the basic organizing systems, such as research,
record keeping, staffing, and so on, in preparation for the campaign.
4. In-house preparations: Finalize your case, develop materials, train com-
mittees, solicit challenge gifts, and recruit volunteers.
5. Lead gifts: Have your committee members acquire lead gifts from board
members, individuals, corporations, and foundations.
6. Public fundraising: Publicly announce your capital campaign (when you
are more than 50 percent to your goal) and build the public solicitation
portion of your campaign.
7. Completion and evaluation: Focus on smaller gifts and bring the cam-
paign to a close, evaluating the entire process, managing recognitions,
and making suggestions for improvement in the next campaign.
Note that much of the work of the capital campaign is actually done behind
the scenes during the first five stages of planning. The campaign only goes
public in Stage 6, when you are more than 50 percent assured of reaching
your campaign goal.
Testing the waters: Campaign feasibility
Testing for readiness is a major part of the success of the capital campaign. Is
your organization ready? Is your board ready? Is the public ready? Many fac-
tors, both internal and external, affect the overall success or failure of your
campaign.
301
Chapter 20: Building Buildings, Nonbuildings, and Futures

Many organizations rely on consulting firms to do feasibility studies when they
prepare a major campaign. Using people at a distance from your organization
enables those interviewed to be open and honest in their responses. If a
person from the organization asks questions like “Do you think that our organi-
zation is ready for this campaign? Do you think that the goal is realistic?” —
someone closely affiliated with your organization may not feel free to answer
candidly. You can also rely on the objectivity of the consultant to recommend
whether now is the time for a major campaign; someone who is excited about
the prospect in-house may push for a capital campaign before the time is right.
A feasibility study helps you
 Determine whether your case statement is solid
 Evaluate your board readiness
 Test the overall campaign goal
 Test whether donor record-keeping systems are ready for a capital 
campaign
 Test the markets for giving and the working Gift Range Chart for to the
campaign.
Even if you’re a three-person shop, do a feasibility study before you launch a
major campaign. Although your study may not be something coordinated by
a national consulting firm, you still should test your case statement, your
goals, and your gift range chart with a number of high-level donors.
Don’t worry: It’s okay to go out to your stakeholders and say, “Here’s what
our board is talking about. Does this sound feasible to you?” Take along a
questionnaire and do the interview in person. It builds the relationship and
makes the donor feel as though she has really helped.
This type of interview accomplishes another goal as well: The interview and
the questions you ask often give you a sense of which pitches are most and
least desirable in the minds of your donors. The interview gives you an idea
of which appeals to leave out of the overall plan.
Sometimes a feasibility test lets you know that you’re trying to do too
many things at once. The recommendation may come back that you need
to divide your campaign up into smaller segments. If this happens, don’t
despair: Instead, look at it as an opportunity to celebrate a greater number
of successes.
Setting your goal
Like everything else, setting the goal for your capital campaign may be the
subject of long and hard debate. You hear the clashes between risk takers
and stability — you see the different priorities and definitions of a number of
302
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

people who care about the organization and want to see it grow in the right
direction. The financial goal for the capital campaign is wrapped up in the
vision and agenda of many individuals, so be prepared for much discussion
before you finalize the capital campaign goal.
When you arrive at a consensus about the amount of money you need to raise
and the realistic possibility of attaining it, test the number. In your feasibility
tests, in interviews with donors, ask people “Do you think that this is a realistic
amount?” Listen carefully to the responses and evaluate them. If you get too
many “Nos,” go back to the discussion table with the responses and reevaluate
your position.
Here’s a sample listing of capital campaign goals:
 Solicit large amounts
 Stretch out pledges over multiple years
 Use challenge and matching grants
 Include corporations and foundations
 Stress lead gifts
The best-laid plans — especially when construction is involved— overrun
their boundaries. Be sure that you create a contingency fund to take care
of overages on projects and unexpected expenses. As a ballpark figure, plan
on putting aside between five and ten percent to handle those unexpected
construction overruns.
Identifying lead gifts and challenge gifts
A lead gift is one of the first few — and biggest — gifts you can expect during
your campaign. These gifts take a lot of time and cultivation and are devel-
oped and solicited strategically, over months (or perhaps years). A relatively
low number of lead gifts comprise a high percentage of your overall fundrais-
ing goal. According to the Center for Philanthropy at Indiana University,
Purdue University at Indianapolis, the numbers break down like this:
 The 10 to 15 top gifts comprise the top 34 percent of your total.
 The next 75 to 100 gifts make up the next 33 percent.
 All other gifts make up only 33 percent of the total.
A Gift Range Chart (see Chapter 5) helps you plot out the number of major
gifts you need in order to make your fundraising goal. The gift range chart is
extremely important in capital campaigns, as well, and can help you deter-
mine not only how many of each type of gift you need, but also the number of
people you have to approach in order to reach that goal.
303
Chapter 20: Building Buildings, Nonbuildings, and Futures

Those first few gifts of a capital campaign are important pieces of your over-
all capital campaign strategy. So just who will be your first lead givers?
 Board members. You must have a giving board in order to run a success-
ful capital campaign.
 High-level donors. Your major givers in other areas of your fundraising
program will also be those who are likely to step up to the plate with a
substantial gift in your capital campaign. You need to think of gift incen-
tives, such as naming opportunities and other forms of recognition, as
well as a revitalized case that helps donors see why now is the right time
to give that large gift.
 Stakeholders in business and philanthropy. Lead gifts may also come
from the corporate or philanthropic community. Companies may be
interested in sponsoring a portion of your campaign by providing a 
challenge gift that inspires others to give at a higher level. See Chapter 22
for more about soliciting corporate gifts.
One of the most effective vehicles in a capital campaign is the challenge gift.
A challenge gift is one in which a lead giver (an individual, a corporation,
or a foundation) says something like, “I’ll give you $100,000 if you can get it
matched by July 1, 2007.” This enables you to go to other prospective high-
level donors and say, “If you give now, your money will go twice as far.”
Because of the matching funds, a donor that gives $25,000 will get the good
feeling of knowing that his gift actually takes you $50,000 closer to your cam-
paign goal. See Chapter 21 for more about challenge gifts.
This decade will see one of the largest transfers of wealth that it’s possible to
imagine. Estimates of the amount that will be transferred from one generation
to the next run as high as $14 trillion! When this type of generational transfer
takes place, you have a huge opportunity to solicit a major gift.
When you have your prospects identified and your goals and approaches in
place, your fundraising for these larger gifts involves all the techniques dis-
cussed in Chapters 7 through 16 of this book. However, your prospect list is
typically more targeted, and the win for your efforts can be bigger, though
the time you spend in cultivating these big-hitter relationships can involve
months or even years.
Going public
Suppose that you’ve completed the campaign plan and the consultants have
told you the time is ripe for your capital campaign. So you pull your commit-
tees together, begin prospect research, gather your materials, and secure all
the necessary lead gifts. You’re already two-thirds to your goal and you’re
certain you’re going to make it. Now what do you do?
304
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

Sit back and coast to the finish line? Nope. Now’s the time to go public with
your campaign.
A successful capital campaign is a big boost for the morale of your supporters
and the public perception of your nonprofit organization. It says a number of
things to the public at large:
 This organization knows what it’s doing.
 This organization is responsible with its money.
 Other people believe in this organization — look who’s giving!
 This organization is worth a lot — look at the size of its goal!
 This organization is doing good work.
Each of these messages is important in a dollars-and-sense kind of way.
Because fundraising is more about relationships than it is about money, and
because relationships are built on trust, which is built on credibility, you have
a great opportunity to further the trustworthiness of your organization. The
more trustworthy your organization, the more people will want to identify with
you. So what do you need in place to take your campaign to the public?
 A spokesperson (this may be your committee chairperson)
 Visual aids (something like the big United Way thermometer comes
to mind)
 Printed materials (brochures, pledge cards, flyers, and so on)
 E-mail lists and a Web site
 Media contacts, such as radio, television, and the Internet
 Donors willing to say why they believe in your organization
Make sure that you prepare for going public in your campaign plan so that
you’ve budgeted the necessary funds, prepared and printed the necessary
materials, and established the ground rules and the organization for your
publicity effort. See Chapter 12 for more about working with the media.
Following up with your capital campaign
Your campaign has been a success. So, how do you wind down the campaign?
Follow-up to your campaign includes major celebrations, which should be
part of your publicity component. Have dinners to thank the volunteers —
and invite the media. Hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new wing — and
invite the media. Make a fuss over the first new teen mom to graduate from
your job training facility — and invite the media. After doing all this work 
quietly, the time has come for you to pat yourself on the back in a very
public way.
305
Chapter 20: Building Buildings, Nonbuildings, and Futures

As you bring the public campaign to a close, you need to organize a number
of things to make sure that the gifts promised are delivered and the goodwill
created continues:
 Effective and quick responses to gifts from all donors
 Timely follow-up with thank-you notes and receipts
 Accurate accounting and data tracking
 Evaluations and reports on various stages of the campaign
 An open letter of thanks to the community, published in the local
papers, for support in reaching your now-successful campaign goals
Debriefing everybody
Especially with something as big and far-reaching as a capital campaign, learn-
ing from your successes as well as your mistakes is important. What went right
in your capital campaign? What would you avoid like the plague in future?
Before you disperse your committees, ask them to meet one last time for
a debriefing. Prepare a questionnaire related to the individual tasks you
assigned. Ask people to rate their own effectiveness as a team and to list any
suggestions that they would make for the next team to step into their shoes.
Ask them about likes and dislikes about the process, and glean any important
insights for the next capital campaign team that comes along.
Finally, summarize all the information you gather (and archive it for the future)
before closing the book on the capital campaign fund altogether. Remember
that the effects of your work, resulting in long-term pledges that will pay over a
number of years, will be coming in for many months to come. The knowledge
that you gained helps others begin where you left off and can take your organi-
zation into the future.

Chapter 21
Securing Major Gifts,
Planned Gifts, and
the Challenge Grant
In This Chapter
 Matching the donor’s cause to your mission
 Choosing planned gift instruments
 Understanding the challenges of challenge grants
You’re sitting on Mrs. Lewis’s divan. Your mouth is dry. This is the
moment you’ve been preparing for, for months.
You had to lunch together and follow-up conversations. You’ve exchanged per-
sonal correspondence repeatedly. You know her dog on a first-name basis.
From your relationship to date you expect Mrs. Lewis to be a major giver in
one way or another. Now is the time to see how substantial her support will be.
This chapter explains the important role of the big-time giver to your organi-
zation, whether that person (or in some cases corporation or foundation)
presents you with a huge check, or offers to match other donors’ contribu-
tions with a challenge grant. We also explain how to go about dealing with
planned giving, a scenario where an individual provides for your organization
in the will. Not everyone has the means to give that $5,000, $20,000, or
$100,000 gift, but those who do — and who have an interest and a heart for
your mission — can help you greatly through one of these three mechanisms.
In this chapter, we provide a basic introduction to the major gift and the
planned gift concept. We encourage you to talk to planned gift specialists for
particulars on how to develop a planned giving program that is right for your
organization.

Finally, we explore the potential of challenge grants, one of the most effective
fundraising tools around today. The challenge grant is a funding that is
offered — sometimes anonymously — contingent on “matching” funds
being raised.
Making a Perfect Match
The fact that your organization’s mission and the interests of the donor are
compatible is the most important facet of securing a major gift. The giver’s
ability to give is important, yes; but more important is her interest in giving,
the position of her heart on the cause you represent, which makes for a win-
win situation.
This matching of causes is one of the principal reasons why knowing the heart
of your major giver is of primary importance in securing major gifts. Die-hard
fundraisers who are more interested in getting the money than they are in
building relationships seem to have a “grab the money and run” philosophy,
but that approach only works (and not very well) in lower levels of giving.
After you begin talking to a donor about a major gift — $5,000, $10,000, or
$15,000 — other things, like mission and fit, become more important.
Although you don’t want to insult somebody by asking for an outrageous
amount of money, donors are often flattered that fundraisers think that they
are capable of giving at such high amounts. Asking for more than you expect
also gives you another benefit: It gives you the opportunity to accept less,
which lets the donor know that it’s okay to “bargain down,” and you can 
suggest a lower amount with which the donor may be more comfortable.
Deciding on the major gift amounts
for your organization
The word “major” is relative. What is a major gift? To a small organization,
it may be $5,000. To a university, it may be $5,000,000. To a tiny, shoestring
agency, a major gift may simply be a gift that is bigger than the norm.
Consider what would be a major gift in your organization. Take a look at your
overall operating budget and ask yourself: What type of gift would be a major
help to us? Five percent of the operating budget? Ten? Two?
Deciding on the amount that represents a major gift for your organization can
help you plan to solicit for that amount. It also keeps you from settling for a
$2,000 gift when you really should be moving your givers toward $5,000.
308
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

As you decide on the level of major gifts for your organization, ask yourself
the following questions:
 Who are our major givers likely to be?
 Who will work on building relationships with our major givers?
 Do we have any givers now who can be cultivated into major givers? If
so, who are they?
 Does our board have expertise in this area? Do we need to have board
training on how to ask for major gifts?
 Is our board currently giving at a major gift level? If not, why not? If so,
who are our highest givers?
 How do we recognize our major givers?
A major gift is defined differently for a capital campaign than for your annual
operating campaign. In a capital campaign, you strategize with big gifts at the
top — in that category, $1,000,000 is a major gift, but $10,000 wouldn’t be. See
Chapter 20 for more information about capital campaigns.
Getting to the heart of the all-important
major giver
In Chapter 8, we tell you all about the major giver — who he is, what he
wants, and how you can make sure that the donor-agency relationship is a
positive one.
The most important thing to remember about the major giving prospect is
that you work with him or her over time. The relationship is one that grows
through years of involvement. Your organization establishes a relationship
with Mrs. Edna Lewis, for example, by following these steps:
 Identify her as a prospective major donor.
 Qualify the donor by determining her interest in your organization and
her ability to give.
 Cultivate the donor and bring her ever closer to the heart of your mission.
 Ask, listen, and respond to her needs.
 Request the major gift.
 Acknowledge the gift and continue the relationship by letting her know
how her gift is making a difference to the people you serve.
309
Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant

The give and take in a major campaign
The major giver in a capital campaign gives a lead gift that can make a huge
difference in the progress of your fundraising effort. A major gift, one of the
lead gifts for your campaign, may be a substantial amount of money, such as
$25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or more. When you ask for lead gifts in a capital
campaign, remember that you are looking for a few gifts that comprise 40 to
60 percent of your total.
Those people who are regular and large donors to your annual fund are the
best candidates for major, lead, and challenge gifts.
Be prepared for your major giver to want to contact a tax advisor or lawyer
before agreeing to a pledge amount. In fact, if she doesn’t suggest it, you
should, as a donor service. Some major givers may want to draft a contract
to stipulate certain aspects of the agreement. Work with your organization’s
legal team and your donor’s tax advisors to come to an understanding. It’s in
everybody’s best interest.
Corporate giving and cause-related major gifts
Corporations are a source of some major gifts; but more and more, corpora-
tions give when the gift, its purpose, and any publicity associated with it
aligns with the mission of the corporation. This is called cause-related mar-
keting. For example, a waterworks company may want to sponsor the water
tanks at the aquarium at the zoo, and may want to attach the company name
to the tanks in some way. This is not only a way to build their community-
spirited image, but they also get lots of exposure as those crowds stroll by.
Companies that are dependent on research often endow chairs in the subject
matter they care about in a university. A company that deals with healthcare
needs may donate money to the Red Cross. Cause-related giving is happening
more and more between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. Alliances,
partnerships, and sponsorships are here to stay.
Valuing the relationship:
Stewardship in action
What kind of reporting method do you plan to use to let your major giver
know that her donation is going where you said that it was going to go? Each
individual major gift is a campaign in itself — each individual deserves to be
met with, listened to, and valued. After you receive the gift, nothing changes.
In fact, it’s more important than ever to include major donors such as Edna
Lewis in the loop. She has become a part of your organization through her
donation. She should be part of the communication flow when there is news
310
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

to report and glad tidings to share. This helps the donor know that this is
about more than money and makes her glad she gave to your organization as
generously as she did.
Your annual report is one way you can report the use of donated funds to your
donors. But for high-level givers, personalized letters with specific information
about how their gift was applied are a nice touch. For example, your letter
could say, “Your generous donation helped us provide training for 15 more teen
moms than we helped last year.” Or, you could write, “Because of you, Edna,
Sarah was able to finish high school, take a computer course, and get an entry-
level job at a small publishing company. Her daughter, Haley, is healthy, caught
up on her shots, and happy in our day-care center while her mom works.”
Personalized attention makes the major giver glad she’s in a relationship with
you. And in addition to respectfully honoring the continuing relationship, it
keeps the door open for a planned gift in the future.
Creating a major gift strategy
What can you offer major givers in return for their generosity? In reality, they
are looking for specific things from your organization. They want to know
that your organization
 Cares about the issues they care about
 Values them as individuals
 Appreciates their gifts
 Practices good management
 Plans intelligently
 Selects good people who represent it well
 Presents an image they want to align with
Set the ground rules for major gifts before you need them. Come up with
naming opportunities and other forms of recognition. The rationale? Know
what you want and you can attain it.
Get your committee together, and use these tips when developing your major
gift strategy:
 Brainstorm a list of major giving ideas.
 Get board approval before you proceed.
 Create ideas you can live with for quite some time — you can’t remove
the name from a named gift at the drop of a hat.
311
Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant

 Don’t be afraid to stretch a little — set your sights high. (Remember that
yesterday’s major gift, which may have been $10,000, is today’s small
potatoes.)
 Consider whether corporate sponsorships or in-kind contributions can
be in your major gift strategy.
As you put together your major gift strategy, remember to think about how to
reward your donors when they enter into this high-level relationship with
your organization.
Some of the ideas you can include in your strategy are:
 Keep in touch with your high-level donors often. Mail them newsletters.
Call them up on the phone. Send an e-newsletter. Follow up in other
ways, too.
 Recognize your high-level donors’ gifts. Host a special dinner for your
high-level donors. Take the individual donor out to lunch. Invite your
donors to be part of an elite giving club.
 Consider a naming opportunity. Create a complete list of items that are
available for naming and keep careful track of who is offered, and who
accepts, these naming opportunities. Make sure that two different staff
or board members do not promise the same naming item to two differ-
ent donors. Naming opportunities are best planned carefully and used
slowly, which helps preserve the importance of the naming item and
keeps you from making a potentially embarrassing mistake.
If you do use naming opportunities, decide ahead of time how much must be
donated in return for the naming. Is it $40,000 for a garden, $20,000 for a foun-
tain, and $10,000 for a bench? Make sure that the naming items are planned,
approved, and listed as available before you begin publicizing your major
gift plan.
Preparing for Planned Gifts
And at the very top of the fundraising ladder, you find the planned gift. A
planned gift is a long-term, high-dollar gift that may come to your organiza-
tion in the form of a bequest, property, insurance, or one of several planned
giving instruments.
Some fundraisers build entire careers around the concept of planned giving,
as well they should. This highly specialized area requires continual education
on current tax laws, financial instruments, best practices, and application
and development of gift strategies.
312
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

Planned giving is one of the hottest areas in fundraising right now. Because of
the huge transfer of wealth that will take place over the next two decades and
the aging baby-boomer population, smart ways to preserve and hand down
assets are in demand. Planned giving instruments give donors ways to protect
their holdings, provide for their families, and leave a legacy to an organization
with a mission they believe in.
Getting the gift that keeps on giving
A planned gift is the Big Kahuna — the gift that truly keeps on giving after your
donor has passed away. It can range from a simple bequest to a complex trust.
As you might expect, this level of gift comes from a smaller percentage of your
complete donor list — generally three percent of your total number of support-
ers have everything it takes to be a planned giving donor.
When we first heard the term planned gift, we thought “That’s odd — aren’t
all gifts planned?” The phrase “planned gift” actually refers to the high level
of planning required — by fundraising officers, financial advisors, tax attor-
neys, and more — to develop just the right giving plan for a high-level donor
who wants to leave a major gift to a charitable organization.
Planned gifts
 Provide estate planning for donors
 Can give donors income and possible estate tax savings
 Are not necessarily large and are sometimes given during the
donor’s lifetime
 Can provide an income to the donor or to someone designated by the
donor
 Can improve the relationship between the giver and your organization
while the donor is still alive
 Involve the donor’s tax and financial advisors
So who is this person planning to benefit your group after he or she passes
away? A potential planned giving donor will be
 Engaged with your organization at a high level
 Interested in making a difference for the organization long term
 Able to make a large donation (either now, by investing funds in a
planned giving instrument or later, when the ability to get at the funds
for their own use [called accessibility and liquidity] aren’t issues)
313
Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant

The most important rule of a planned giving program: The needs of the donor
come first. Your donor places high trust in your helping her find, evaluate, and
select the right planned giving instrument for her needs and financial situation.
Although you are working to secure a gift for your organization, remember that
the gift must be the right “fit,” and the donor should have his own advisors
review and respond to the planned gift plan before the contract is signed.
Differentiating planned giving
from other gifts
If you have a good, healthy donor program in place, in which you are cultivat-
ing donors, bringing them ever closer to the mission of your organization,
and upgrading them to higher gifts each year, a planned giving program is a
matter of education. It’s a logical next step.
Planned giving is only about 40 years old. A change in the tax laws in the late
1960s concerning how charitable contributions are made led to the develop-
ment of the planned giving instruments we have today.
There are three primary differences between planned gifts and other gifts:
 The size of the gift, which might be money, stock, insurance, or a home,
property, or material goods.
 When the gift is paid. Although the gift is ordinarily paid to the organiza-
tion upon the death of the donor, some planned giving instruments pay
the donor and/or other selected recipients an income during the donor’s
lifetime, as well.
 The complexity of the gift. A planned gift is a transaction that requires the
collaboration of tax advisors, lawyers, financial advisors, and fundraising
professionals, all working together in the donor’s best interest.
Your potential planned giver will want to ask his tax advisor over how many
years he can allocate the deduction for his planned gift. Many people can’t
take the deduction all in one year. Make sure that your donor talks to his tax
professional and gets all the answers he needs before you sign a contract.
Timing is everything: When to start
If you’ve just begun putting a fundraising system in place, or you’re a one-
person development office, you may be wondering how important it is to
have a planned giving program and when you need to start it.
314
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

One big mistake organizations make with planned giving is in not starting it
soon enough. When you create planned giving opportunities, you are generat-
ing gifts that will come to you later. Prepared organizations always have a
handle on who their top-level donors are and what kind of potential gifts
are “in the pipeline,” which means future planned gifts as well as projected
donations from other campaigns.
How do you know when you’re ready to start a planned giving program?
 You have an established donor base.
 You have demonstrated good stewardship consistently.
 You have the resources (on your board or through a consultant) to offer
the high-end support a planned giving program requires.
Many nonprofit organizations rely on the pro bono services of tax or legal
advisors to set up and maintain a planned giving program. Traditionally only
the larger organizations (museums, symphonies, universities, and so on) can
afford a full-time staff member who specializes in this area.
Gearing up for planned giving
How many times have you heard us talk about the mission of your organiza-
tion? Although we can assume that you have a crystal-clear mission and the
publications to support it, before you embark on a program that takes you
into the deep waters of planned giving, you need to be certain that you have
the plan — and the people to work it — in place.
You need three important things to get a planned giving program going:
 A board that’s ready for planned giving
 A plan to implement a planned giving program
 The professional resources to help you investigate, set up, and maintain
the program
Do you need a planned giving committee on your board? Not all organizations
are set up the same way, but some boards organize a planned giving commit-
tee to decide important things like what the responsibilities of the members
will be, how funds will be invested, what the board’s legal responsibilities are,
and how the invested funds will be used. Other boards simply have a devel-
opment committee that has the responsibility for overseeing the planned
giving program, and the board of the endowment handles investment issues.
315
Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant

Starting with your board
Making sure that your board is ready is an important part of putting a planned
giving program in place. If your organization has a good reputation in the com-
munity and is led by solid, respected leaders, it may be time to explore the
planned giving option. Open the topic for discussion with your board and ask
a local financial expert (if you don’t have one on your board) to explain the 
various planned giving instruments and their individual features. Pull together
a focus group to discuss the pros and cons of a planned giving program. You
might also want to do an informal survey among some of your closest donors,
saying, “We are thinking about starting a planned giving program for the people
closest to our mission. Do you think that people would be interested in a pro-
gram that. . . .”
Because planned giving is such a highly specialized area, nonprofit organiza-
tions considering a planned giving program for the first time need to get edu-
cated about the process before they begin. Look for classes in your area that
offer the basics of planned giving (a financial services firm in your area may
offer classes on planned giving instruments).
Creating a plan for planned gifts and choosing gifts for the plan
The largest part of preparation for a planned gifts program is in determining
your goals and guidelines for the solicitation, acceptance, and administration
of the gifts. You will need legal and financial advice as you prepare the guide-
lines. Your planned giving committee will draft policies that determine
 The type of gifts you offer
 The income offered to donors
 The legal and ethical responsibilities of the fundraiser
 How you preserve the confidentiality of the donor
 How assets will be distributed
 Allowed investments
In planned giving, a number of different vehicles can be used — which is one
of the reasons that having a well-trained, knowledgeable, and up-to-date con-
sultant or staff member is vitally important. The person who works with
donors on planned giving possibilities needs to know her stuff. She needs to
be able to answer questions about the various instruments, use her
resources to find the solutions to complex situations, and make recommenda-
tions in the best interests of the donor. Here are some of the more popular
planned giving instruments your organization will be working with as you
begin to explore planned gifts:
 Wills
 Charitable gift annuities
316
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

 Charitable remainder trusts
 Insurance and interest gifts
Here’s a rundown on each of these different gift types:
 Working with wills. A will is the simplest and most common form of
planned giving instrument. Because most people are familiar with wills,
this is the easiest instrument to explain and to market. In working with
your organization to draft their wills, donors can protect their depen-
dents, reduce their estate taxes, and control the way in which their
assets are distributed — and to whom. Some donors like leaving 
contributions to charities in their will for the reason that the gift is 
revocable — if the donor changes her mind later, she can revise her
will and erase the gift. In other gift forms that are based on contractual
agreements, this is not the case.
 Assessing annuities. In a charitable gift annuity, the donor makes a gift of
cash or assets to your organization and your organization agrees to pay
an income to the donor and/or her beneficiaries until the donor’s death.
Your organization invests the donated funds and pays out a fixed income
to the donor. The benefits to the donor include receipt of tax-free income
and income, capital, and estate tax benefits. The ACGA (American Council
on Gift Annuities), a national organization of charities founded as the
Committee on Gift Annuities, educates charities about gift annuities and
other planned gifts. You can find suggested charitable gift annuity rates by
going to their Web site at www.acga-web.org/giftrates.html. Most
charities rely on the ACGA to help them determine the payout rate for
charitable gift annuities.
 Tackling trusts. The charitable remainder trust is a three-way relationship,
arranged between a charity and a donor through a trustee, who manages
the account. Using this type of instrument, the donor sets up a trust for
the donation, which pays out upon his death. This benefits the donor by
reducing the donor’s estate tax and providing income and capital gains
tax benefits. A charitable lead trust is slightly different from a charitable
remainder trust in that an annual payment is made to the charity for a
number of years specified by the donor. At the end of that time, the prin-
cipal is returned to the donor or paid to a designated beneficiary.
 Investigating insurance and interest gifts. Donors can also will an organi-
zation the proceeds of an individual insurance policy. The charity collects
the gift upon the death of the donor. If the premiums are continuing, typi-
cally the organization pays the premiums and the donor sends in an
annual contribution to provide for these payments. Insurance policies
are fairly common planned giving instruments. In some cases, you can
use a two-fold system: A charitable remainder trust purchases an insur-
ance policy on the person who donated the money in the first place. The
charity gets the money in the trust, and the insurance proceeds go to a
designated heir selected by the donor.
317
Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant

State regulations on annuities and trusts vary, so check the regulations in your
area before beginning such programs. You can get a listing of state regulations
by going to the Planned Giving Resources site at www.pgresources.com/
welcome.html.
Marketing the plan to the giving public
When you announce, “We now have a planned giving program,” your next
task is to educate your donors about what that means, how it benefits them,
and how they can best take advantage of it. How can you educate your
donors about your program?
 Mention it in your newsletter.
 Send a flyer to prequalified donors in a targeted mail campaign.
 Write personal letters to individual donors.
 Create a new planned giving brochure.
 Send an e-mail message to online donors.
 Advertise in publications with your audience base.
 Announce it at a donor recognition luncheon.
 Provide information about your program on your Web site.
318

Marketing tips for planned giving
Part of getting your program going is to let
people who advise their clients about such pro-
grams know about it. How will speaking to pro-
fessionals help your program? Education is the
key. If tax advisors, lawyers, and financial
experts in your area know about your program,
they can recommend it to their clients, saying,
“You’re in an estate tax rate category in which
you can designate the money for a charity you
care about; otherwise, that same money is
going to be paid to the state and federal gov-
ernment for estate and inheritance taxes.” Who
wants to pay money to the state when they
could be leaving behind a legacy with an or-
ganization they care about?
Here are a couple of ideas for marketing your
program to professionals effectively:
 Get out in the community and make presen-
tations. Go to lawyers’ and accountants’
offices — two groups who will be interested
in what you are offering their clients — and
explain your planned giving program and the
instruments you offer.
 If you live in a small-to-middle-sized town,
go to your local banker and ask, “Who are
the local lawyers in town who deal with
most of the big gifts?” Follow those leads to
have discussions with the attorneys in town
who deal most often with planned giving.

One key to launching a successful planned giving program is to publicize it to
the right audience. If you approach a mid-30s audience with a planned giving
strategy, they are going to say, “Great. Let me get back to you in another 25
years.” If you introduce your program to a select group of high-level givers
who are also retirees, sooner or later they are going to begin coming to you
and saying, “I’m putting together my will. . . .”
Making Money Go that Extra Mile:
Challenge Grants
In Chapter 11, we explain the ins and outs of grant proposal writing. Challenge
grants also involve grant proposals, but with a twist: In this proposal, the
donors of the grant spell out the terms and conditions of the funding. The
donor states that he/she/it will give a substantial gift, if the giving public will
match it. This provides a huge incentive for potential donors to make their
dollars go much, much farther.
When you apply for a challenge grant, you say to your potential funders,
“This is a program that covers not only all the standard grant proposal ingre-
dients but also a plan for securing matching funding, projected amounts,
intended sources, and measurable outcomes.” You want to communicate,
“You have the possibility here to be the whole inspiration for this new initia-
tive. It’s your challenge grant that will make it happen.”

Here are a few examples of situations in which a challenge grant can make a
difference:
 A wealthy patron of your church says, “Boy, I’d like to see us get a new
organ for this place. I’ll put up $15,000 if you can get other people to
match it.”
 The Forever Fund at the United Way was created with the intention of
providing an endowment for the continuance of the organization. The
fundraising effort floundered until the Lilly Endowment came along and
gave a huge challenge incentive.
 A challenge grant helped to start community foundations. Not only did
that challenge grant raise a huge amount of money, but it also created
community foundations that weren’t there before. In 10 years, more than
50 new community foundations were formed that otherwise wouldn’t
have been there, all stimulated by challenge grants from large founda-
tions like Lilly and Kellogg.
Challenge grants do three positive things:
 Challenge grants spotlight your organization and provide an endorse-
ment from a major player. The person or entity giving you the challenge
grant is most likely someone in the public eye — the publicity they
receive for their philanthropy will benefit you both. For your organization,
this alliance means respectability — the “good fundraising” seal of
approval.
 Challenge grants help people feel that their money goes further. If a
foundation gives you $10,000 to start a new family life program and you
match it with another $10,000, everybody giving to your campaign can
feel that a donation went twice as far.
 Challenge grants enable you to honor and reward the giver of the chal-
lenge grant. This person is a “mover and shaker” and probably one of
the closest constituents you have in your organization. The recognition
will help him feel good about his gift and have the satisfaction of knowing
it was his generosity that enabled the whole program to work. This
inspires others to want to make challenge grants in the future, as well.
Who wouldn’t love a challenge grant? The idea is to leverage potential funds
to make the money go further — it truly builds a community of giving that
can have payoffs far into the future.
Before you open up to the possibility of challenge grants, discuss the idea
with your board. Feel out any resistance. Most likely, your board will okay the
idea and want to participate. Often the first challenge gifts you receive are
from board members themselves.

Understanding the mechanics
of challenge grants
Both corporations and foundations are currently playing major roles in giving
challenge grants, because it leverages their money. Their initial investment
may be doubled, tripled, quadrupled, or more. One recent challenge grant
began with a $5 million grant and raised more than $40 million total. The cor-
poration got publicity and credit for initiating a $40 million contribution. This
is potent stuff.
But not all your challenge grants are going to be multimillion-dollar affairs. In
church fundraising drives, the arts, social services, and education, challenge
grants take the money further than the original gift. In each of these areas,
the grants are usually related to something new or to the enlargement of an
existing program.
Live events such as public radio fundraisers, often accept a challenge grant
from a listener or corporation of as little as $1,000 that must be met in the
next hour. If you have access to such media, look for the mini-challenge,
short-time-period grant opportunity.
As you look for ways to get a challenge grant going, keep the plans quiet. Top-
level donors will be interested in getting in on the front end of a big deal —
advertising your intent may diffuse the excitement. Work it all out, approach
the selected donor with the idea, “We’re designing this program and we
think that you would be perfect to lead the campaign with a challenge grant
of $5,000.”
Designing your proposal
When you design the proposal for your challenge grant, it’s important to keep
a key concept in mind: You are giving this person (or funder) the ability to
empower lots of other people to give. This is a powerful thought and the major
difference between a traditional grant proposal and a challenge grant proposal.
When you begin your challenge grant campaign, you want your potential
matching donors to realize that this is a way to increase the effectiveness of
their gift. You also want them thinking, “Gosh, we’d better do this — we cer-
tainly don’t want to be left out!”
If you are leveraging a challenge grant to secure funding from another source,
be prepared to provide proof of the challenge. A letter from the individual or
entity, signed by the appropriate responsible parties, should suffice. Some
organizations may want to see financial statements as well.
321
Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant

Generally there is no designation in a challenge grant proposal for the way in
which the gifts come in — the idea is to get the amount matched.
Challenge grants nearly always have a deadline. This is a practical and help-
ful matter — the deadline gives you a timeframe for your campaign. This
enables you to put some urgency into your fundraising letters, “If we don’t
raise the matching amount by September 24, 2008, we will lose half of the
challenge grant.”
After you’re given the challenge grant, how do you motivate people to give?
You secure great gifts from people and groups that donors admire, with the
promise that donors can extend the reach of their gifts by contributing now.

In This Chapter
 Examining changes to the corporate giving landscape
 Understanding why corporations give
 Locating the perfect corporate donor match
 Approaching corporate donors
N
ot all major givers are individual philanthropists who are interested in
furthering your mission and earning tax benefits and other perks at the
same time — corporations are a source of major giving on an international
scale. Whether they give from their corporate foundations or with corporate
sponsorships, corporations generally want more than a simple “feel-good” for
their part of the bargain.
Philanthropy is good business. Favorable public opinion is a sought-after goal
in both the for-profit and nonprofit sectors. Aligning with a good cause helps
build the community “feel-good” quotient and benefits the company by
boosting goodwill, perhaps increasing sales, raising visibility, and creating a
sense of benevolence and involvement that may help it attract and keep good
employees.
Understanding the Attitudes Behind
Corporate Giving
You can’t really know how to approach donors until you understand the rea-
sons that they give. Individuals may have hundreds of reasons for giving.
Corporations can be a little more straightforward: a blending of practical and
altruistic reasoning.

Many corporations give in the interests of cause-related marketing, a way to
associate themselves with the good guys of charity to spiff up their own public
image. They get free publicity, and free goodwill. People may buy more of their
products over their competitors when they hear of their good deeds. Some
even find that giving is a way to influence politicians regarding legislation
related to their industries.
But many corporations give above and beyond the basic promotional possi-
bilities, and different companies give for different reasons. Some may indeed
have altruistic motives as well as having the desire to “give back” to the com-
munity. In addition to self-promotion, corporations give major gifts because
they want:
 The community to think of them as people friendly (or arts friendly, or
health conscious, whatever the case may be).
 Their employees to see that they care about improving their community.
 To help organizations that do work related to their particular industry
(for example, a medical supply company may make a major gift to a
medical school).
 To give a seal of approval to the cause.
324
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 
Watching how September 11
changed corporate giving
Corporations made a stellar showing post 9-11,
giving more than $621 million, a huge 40 percent
of all the moneys pledged. Compare that to 5.3
percent of all giving in the year 2000 coming
from the corporate sector, and you can see that
corporations made a big shift in 2001.
Why did these businesses give? Yes, the major-
ity of those giving after 9-11 had a presence in
the New York City area and surely knew that
things on Wall Street had to get up and running
quickly, or there could be an impact on their
operations. And yes, there was tremendous
publicity value for stepping up to the plate so
quickly at these difficult times. But surveys con-
ducted after 9-11 show an interesting shift; one
such study conducted by RoperASW showed
that 80 percent of consumers would consider
switching brands because of cause-related
support by a company.
Short term after 9-11, corporate giving went
down because the coffers were temporarily
bare. But long term, corporate giving has begun
to be seen as part of business, part of getting
and keeping customers, and not just a nice-to-
have warm and fuzzy perk.

Finding the Right Corporations
Finding the right corporation is like finding the right mate. Not every corpora-
tion fits with your organization. You have to find a match in interests, priori-
ties, and self-interest.
For this matchmaking effort, put on your business hat. Remember that with a
corporation (as with every donor for that matter but even more so with cor-
porations), giving is an exchange — something for something. Corporations
want to get something out of the relationship, so consider what you have to
offer and who may want to “buy” what you have.
Using the local community hook
Which corporations give in your area? When you start looking for the names,
you’ll see them everywhere: on theatre programs, in the paper, at the park,
and in the schools. Keep a notebook with you so you can jot down names of
local businesses that support nonprofits with missions in your area of serv-
ice. It’s worth a look and some focused research when you begin building the
part of your program that targets corporate giving.
If you have corporations represented on your board, you may already be
receiving corporate gifts. As you start your planning for a corporate fundrais-
ing strategy, get together a focus group of these corporate representatives and
ask what they would most like to see in a presentation about your organiza-
tion. And don’t forget to ask each attendee for the names of three people they
think that you should contact as you begin a corporate fundraising campaign.
325
Chapter 22: Approaching the Corporate Giver
A local giving case in point
In 2004, Bank of America Charitable Foundation
created a program called Neighborhood
Excellence Initiative to address the need for a
national company to find ways to fund local
communities. They specified three components:
Neighborhood Builders, Local Heroes, and
Student Leaders. The program challenged local
leaders to identify the needs of the local com-
munities, identifying the most productive local
nonprofit groups. The program has successfully
provided both funding and leadership training
for local nonprofit staff.
In its first year the program gave 60 different
U.S. organizations in 30 different markets grants
of $200,000 each. Each grant included leader-
ship training to help local nonprofits become
better leaders in their own communities.

Local corporations can be the best source for in-kind donations. For example,
a national supermarket chain with a branch in your town might just donate
food for a fundraising event. Your best bet for such a local in-kind donation
is probably the manager of the local branch store or office, who has some 
latitude to donate to local groups.
Discovering where the CEO’s heart lies
You have managed to get a meeting with the new CEO of Acme Paper Company.
You go there nervous about meeting with such a powerful person but confident
of your cause. You have done your homework and know that the company
Mrs. Anderson headed up previously was a big giver in the healthcare sector,
but now that she’s with Acme Paper, you hope she’ll follow their tradition of
supporting animal-rights-related causes.
As you are ushered into Mrs. Anderson’s office, you are relieved to see pictures
of dogs everywhere . . . until you find out that those pictures belonged to the
outgoing CEO, and Mrs. Anderson is allergic to dogs.
Often a company gives because the person in charge has a certain interest. If
the head of the local bank is an opera nut, you might find a sympathetic ear
for your community operetta group. If you can get to the CEO and have him
or her turn you over to the person at the company who heads up corporate
giving, you have a good shot at getting some kind of gift; it’s a brave corpo-
rate giving manager who will disregard the CEO’s recommendation.
Watch the social pages of your local newspaper to see if the CEO is showing
up at theater openings, hospital fundraisers, or local horse shows. If you are
an arts group, organization that helps pregnant women get healthcare, or
animal rights activist, you may have the hook that will get your foot in the
CEO’s door. (After all, just because Mrs. Anderson is allergic to dogs, doesn’t
mean that she doesn’t have half a dozen cats at home!)
Finding out what serves their interests
With a little strategizing, it’s not hard to figure out the types of logical con-
nections between business and a cause that make sense for corporate giving.
Here are just a few:
 A pharmaceutical company gives money to fund a new community clinic.
 A software company donates free computers to schools, loaded, of
course, with their own software products.
326
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

 The local car dealership gives to a program to put a stop to drunk driving.
 The large smelting plant that used to have issues with polluting the air
gives money to fund an environmental study.
Ironically, even if corporations seem to be part of the problem — for example,
the liquor industry without which there may not be alcoholism donating to a
campaign against drinking and driving — they can claim that if their products
are used responsibly, they’re the good guys.
After you identify companies with which your cause could have a logical con-
nection, you’ve found a likely corporate donor.
Approaching a Corporate Donor
Every corporation and every industry has different concerns, but they are all in
the business of making money. So why are they giving money away? Because
they see some kind of profit in doing so. Approaching a corporate donor isn’t
that different from approaching any donor. You determine
 What their interest is
 What their giving track record is
 How you can help them participate in an area where they want to help,
for whatever reason
But the corporate world does have a few unique differences that we discuss
in the sections that follow.
Researching the corporation ahead of time
Chapter 6 is all about researching donors, and Chapter 8 is all about approach-
ing folks for major gifts. If you’re serious about looking for corporate donors,
read those chapters along with this chapter for more about researching.
With that said, take these special tips about finding a corporation/giving
match. First, corporate giving usually comes from one of two sources, and
they are slightly different:
 Company-sponsored foundations are separate entities under the law
from the corporation they are linked to. Their giving typically is allied
with the corporation’s interests. They usually operate on endowments,
327
Chapter 22: Approaching the Corporate Giver

with contributions from the parent corporation on a regular basis. Their
endowments might grow when the corporation is profitable and shrink
when things aren’t so profitable. These entities are governed by regula-
tions for private foundations.
 Corporate direct-giving programs are a part of the corporation itself and
as such don’t have to meet regulations for a private foundation. In this set
up, the company typically can use up to ten percent of its pre-tax money
to make contributions to charity, though most give more like one percent
on average. These programs have no endowment per se but work off com-
pany profits. Often there is an employee matching gifts program and in-
kind gifts program as part of the corporate direct giving set up.
The first step to finding the right corporation-giving scenario is knowing which
kind of entity you’re approaching. If the corporation has a foundation, you can
go to foundation directories such as The Foundation Directory Online, or the
Foundation Finder at The Foundation Center Web site (www.fdncenter.org).
If they have a direct giving program, typically information can be found on
the company Web site, or try the Internet Prospector’s Reference Desk (www.
internet-prospector.org) for corporations.
Some corporations have both a company-sponsored foundation and a 
corporate-giving program. Go to http://fdncenter.org/funders/grant
maker/gws_corp/corp.html to search The Foundation Center’s Web Sites
of Corporation Grantmakers to find corporation foundations. The site also
provides a list of links that will take you directly to Web sites of corporation
grantmakers to speed your corporate giving search.
328
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 
The difference between promotion and giving
Corporations give, but they do it in the name of
promotion. Give a million, and it makes the front
pages of the papers. (Unless Bill Gates just hap-
pened to give a billion that day, and then your
corporate gift may be buried on page three.)
Give a million, and your name is aligned with a
cause. Give a million, and you become the
national spokesperson and corporate sponsor
of a program to combat the societal ill you are
helping to fight. It makes sense; it makes money;
and it makes friends.
But is it wrong?
Throughout this book we point out that you can’t
and shouldn’t second-guess the motives of your
donors, assuming their intent isn’t illegal. If you
do, you spend all your time and energy qualify-
ing the reasons behind the gift and not acting
responsibly in alignment with your responsibil-
ity to steward the gift. Corporations give, and
that benefits your organization. If their promo-
tions are in alignment with your mission and you
can work out an equitable exchange, everybody
wins — most of all, the people you serve.

The next piece of the corporate-giving puzzle is to figure out the types of 
programs that corporations support. This is very similar to the way you find
the right foundation to support your cause. Each corporation or corporate-
affiliated foundation publishes information about the type of programs they
fund. Look on their Web site or contact them for a copy of their guidelines.
The guidelines tell you whether the foundation leans toward the arts, health-
related causes, education, community-focused issues, or whatever. Then go
for the ones that seem a good match to your cause.
Knowing your value to the donor
Don’t ever forget that your organization has something to bring to the table
in the corporate-giving exchange. For example:
 You lend an image of goodwill and credibility to the corporation.
 You offer tax advantages for corporations donating pretax dollars.
 You provide a way for corporations to attract good employees who
share their charitable interests.
 You help to improve the community in which the corporation exists and
its employees live.
When you approach a corporation for a major gift, you are working with some-
body who understands the value of this relationship better than most. You can
use that to feel confident approaching corporate givers in a businesslike way.
If you’re having trouble finding the right initial contact at a company, try
searching their Web site for the corporate affairs or community relations
department. If the company doesn’t, as far as you can tell, have such depart-
ments, start with public relations or marketing.
Putting together your presentation
When you’re applying for a corporate grant, you have to jump through all the
hoops that other kinds of donors put you through. Specifically, you should:
 Research the specific guidelines the corporation publishes for submit-
ting applications.
 Meet all deadlines and include everything the guidelines require.
 Build a compelling case for your organization by including your case
statement brought up-to-date, your accomplishments, and your ability
to govern your activities professionally.
329
Chapter 22: Approaching the Corporate Giver

Don’t forget the financials. Businesspeople are used to seeing balance sheets
and budgets, and they expect to see that you are a viable business with some
business savvy in your operations. If you have strong corporate types on
your board, stress that. Include their resumes, or at least a short biographi-
cal paragraph on each of them, with your application. Try to get one-on-one
personal meetings with your key board people and the corporation represen-
tatives if possible.
Following up in a businesslike way
Any good businessperson will tell you, good follow-up is respected in the cor-
porate world. Of course you should look for guidance about likely timeframes
in the corporate or corporate foundation’s application guidelines, but if the
estimated time of response has come and gone, follow up with a letter or
phone call. You can inquire as to whether any additional information is
needed. This contact could cause your application to get unearthed from a
pile of applications and get some attention ahead of less proactive applicants.
After you get one corporate gift don’t stop; continue to notice the corpora-
tions in your area that are giving to organizations in your particular field, be
it the arts, education, health, human services, or civic affairs. Look for those
sponsorships, and keep that data, and be sure to feed it back into your ever-
expanding research file. One day in the not-too-distant future, the file may
lead to an exceptional major gift.

Building and Growing
Endowments
In This Chapter
 Understanding what an endowment is
 Finding ways to get people excited about funding an endowment
 Managing an endowment after you get it
D
id you ever read an old Victorian novel where the hero lived off his trust
fund or inheritance, and you always wanted to know how to get yourself
one of those? An endowment is kind of like that: It provides a nest egg of
funds, and your organization lives off the profits from the nest egg.
Endowments come in different types, and setting up and managing one has
its own ins and outs. In this chapter you discover what an endowment is,
whether it’s right for you, and what’s involved in getting and keeping one.
Endowing the Future
Where a gift of $200,000 to fund a new wing of your AIDS clinic is great, it’s a
one-time gift that gives and then stops giving. The whole idea behind an
endowment is to take advantage of the profits a substantial amount of money
can generate, without ever emptying the treasure chest itself. This process
involves a lot of lawyers, paperwork, and administration. But if you’re the right
kind of organization, endowments can set you up for a more secure future.
Understanding an endowment
An endowment is simply a donation of funds that brings with it a stipulation
that it be invested; the principal stays intact and the organization feeds off the
investment returns. A small amount of the principal may also be paid out each

year (perhaps 4 percent or so), in turn making the original money go much far-
ther, which makes everybody happy. Note that an endowment can also consist
of other assets, such as property or securities. Trust funds, memorial trusts,
and asset base are other terms you’ll hear used for endowments.
There are typically two types of endowment, restricted and unrestricted.
Here’s how they differ:
 The interest on unrestricted endowment funds can be used in any way the
organization’s board sees fit, on any program or administrative cost.
 Restricted endowment funds are earmarked for a particular type of spend-
ing, meaning that either the major donor stipulated how the money
would be spent when giving the gift (this kind of gift is called donor des-
ignated), or the organization specified that the fund would be focused in
one area when setting it up.
In addition, the length of an endowment can vary. An endowment may be per-
manent or term. Here’s how these lengths differ:
 A permanent endowment is intended to exist in perpetuity, which is a
fancy way to say that it is meant to last forever and the endowment
funds themselves are not meant to be used up or sold off. Only income
dollars can be spent.
 A term endowment can be set up with an expiration date. When you
reach that date, some or all the principal can be spent.
You may also set up a quasi endowment. This means that your organization
sets up some funds to function as an endowment, instead of the endowment
being set up from donor funds.
Finding the right fit
Endowments aren’t for everybody. Universities and community foundations are
the prototypical endowment candidates (though not the only ones), because
they share the following characteristics that normally make an organization a
good fit for an endowment:
 They have been around a while and are expected to be around for many
more years to come.
 They have a reasonably guaranteed constituency. Where your commu-
nity arts project may fade away if the founding members lose interest or
move away, people are likely to want to provide a college education for
kids for a long, long time.
332
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

 The mission is broad enough. A community foundation that serves the
community’s needs, no matter what they may be, can adapt its mission
as times change.
An endowment also typically involves a big chunk of change. Some organiza-
tions have endowments in the millions, making the investment of that money
something with heavy-duty earning potential. If your group can’t spend a lot
of time trying to raise a million dollars because that would tap out all the
giving power, leaving you without the funds to run day to day, an endowment
probably isn’t the best place to put your fundraising efforts.
In fact, many endowments are at least started with one huge gift from one
source. But you can add to the endowment over the years. A lot of foundations
are funded by endowments, and they in turn could become donors to your
cause. The Lilly Endowment, for example, is entirely separate from the giant
pharmaceutical Eli Lilly and Company (in fact one of their rules is that they
don’t give to healthcare-related organizations at all). Lilly family members
established it as a way for their family to give back to society for their success.
Deciding whether you can build 
an endowment
How do you know if your organization has what it takes to build an endow-
ment? There are a few key elements to look for:
 You have to have a completely committed board and staff that will stick
with you through a lengthy process of endowment building.
 You have to have a very clear mission and a strong fundraising program
already in place.
 It helps to have an endowment figurehead, somebody who is very visible
and who attracts money and support.
 You have the resources to provide sound investment advice and man-
agement and a demonstrable investment strategy to attract donors.
 You have access to the kind of heavy hitters that it takes to seed an
endowment with substantial gifts upfront.
 Be an organization where the long term is important. When you build an
endowment, you are selling people the idea of your group’s longevity.
Many donors want to see that the money they give results in a program
or visible change today. If you can make people get excited over the idea
of just ensuring your continuation, you can get them to give. But never
forget: for them to be excited about you continuing tomorrow, you have
to show them that you are doing great things today.
333
Chapter 23: Building and Growing Endowments

Trolling for Endowment Gifts
In an ideal world you pick up the phone one morning, and Mr. Gray, a local
billionaire, tells you he’s giving $2 million to your group for an endowment,
no strings attached. You thank Mr. Gray profusely, hang up, and shout, “Yes!!”
In the real world, though, it isn’t impossible that your organization will just
receive a large gift out of the blue, large enough to form the basis of an
endowment. However, if no single gift drops in your lap, you have to go about
building an endowment in a methodical way.
Getting your board to buy in
The first step in building an endowment is to get everybody in your group to
agree that an endowment is the right way to go. They need to commit to a
long haul, and everybody has to feel comfortable that you can continue your
other forms of fundraising and keep all your core programs and functions
running, while also raising an endowment.
Then set a goal of getting a handful of significant donations as the start of your
endowment. People give money to endowments when they see that there’s
already a solid financial base. To that end, find out whether your board mem-
bers themselves have contacts who are able to give such large gifts. And
don’t forget foundations and corporations as potential major gift givers. See
Chapter 8 for more about how to approach foundations and corporations.
After you have a few large gifts as the centerpiece of your endowment, plan
and run a long-term campaign to solicit additional gifts.
Explaining the value to donors
Some people are down on endowments. Why? Because they think that an
organization that has some financial security may be less responsive to its
constituency. Also, if you exist to solve a problem, ensuring your long-term
existence suggests that you’ll never solve the problem.
In reality, though you gain some autonomy from the giving whims of the public
with an endowment, you will never be truly separated from them because you,
as a nonprofit, have a stated mission that you must follow. Also, most problems
we tackle never go away completely, or if they do, they leave another gap we
can move to address. If a cure is found for a disease, there is still the issue of
334
Part V: On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail 

fair distribution of that cure to populations that need it most. If we lower the
number of homeless people in our town, we still need to be sure that the popu-
lation trains for and maintains jobs to keep them off the street.
The financial independence provided by an endowment, in reality, lets your
people focus on solving problems, not on raising money. You have the tools
and time to innovate in the way you tackle challenges. And with very few
exceptions, an endowment is not a blank check. It is a cushion that allows
you to focus on the more important issues.
Making your endowment part of
your entire fundraising effort
It may take many years to get an endowment in place, so don’t count your
endowment dollars before they hatch. In the meantime, you have to keep
your other fundraising efforts, such as your annual fund drive and special
program fundraising, going. Be sure that you have enough staff or volunteers
to handle all your fundraising activities. Also, be sure that donors understand
the different types of funding you are now seeking. If possible, encourage
them to support both the ongoing costs of your organization and its long-
term sustainability.
A good print resource for more detail on endowment building is the book
Nonprofit Essentials: Endowment Building by Diana S. Newman (Wiley).
Managing an Endowment
You have reached your goal and have stacks of endowment dollars in the
bank. Now what? The people who gave you this money showed a great deal
of trust in your organization. To take the best advantage of the generosity
you’ve been shown set up the endowment. That means good administrative
processes, a strong investment strategy, and responsible stewardship.
Living off the profits for years
When the major portion of your endowment is in place, you should establish
the infrastructure of people and processes that will administer it. Often
groups work with a lawyer to set up a formal trust or foundation with a
trustee to administer it.
335
Chapter 23: Building and Growing Endowments

It’s a good idea at this point to create an endowment policy document that
lays out policies regarding:
 Accepting gifts
 Gift restrictions
 Donor recognition
 Investing strategy
 Spending policy
Strong policies and management structure give people confidence in the sta-
bility of your endowment.
If you have restricted endowment funds, don’t forget that somebody has to
ensure that any income from the endowment is used in strict accordance
with that restriction. Spending the funds any other way is illegal. (See the sec-
tion below, “Seeking professional help to manage the dollars.”)
Seeking professional help 
to manage the dollars
Most endowed organizations have an investment manager on staff to deal
with the investment strategy, but even those with staff typically rely on out-
side resources to help. Investment companies such as Merrill Lynch can help
with your investment program. You’ll also want an independent accountant
keeping close tabs on the endowment funds — how they’re earning and how
they’re used.
There are software programs available that you can use to manage your

As you set up your investment strategy, keep in mind that many organizations
are now looking at alternative investments that themselves support the organ-
ization’s mission. For example, you might invest in environmentally responsi-
ble companies or funds if your own mission is to clean up the environment.

Check the laws and regulations regarding endowments and trust law in your
state to be sure of your obligations. When you’re dealing with this large a sum
of money, having solid professional help and advice from both a legal and
financial perspective is a must. Setting up and administering an endowment
is like running a good-sized business. Professionalism is a must. But the return
on your investment of time, energy, and resources can be the long-term finan-
cial security of your organization and its work.

Ten Predictions about Fundraising
In This Chapter
 Noting the nonprofit trend toward for-profit
 Watching women become a more important force
 Giving online and across borders
L
ong before our calendars clicked over to the year 2000, we heard predic-
tions of what life will be like in 2005, 2010, and beyond. Today, you hear
predictions of how advanced technology may affect your life. What will
fundraising and philanthropy look like in the future? This chapter aims at
giving you some short-term predictions based on our experiences and rea-
sonable expectations.
Individual Giving Will Grow
Each individual giver could be worth more to you. According to a 2005 study
by the Target Analysis Group, there are two trends for the price of one vis-à-vis
individual givers. First, givers’ own median income is up; and second, their
individual donations are bigger. This increase may be a reflection of the wealth
of an aging population, which you’ll read more about in this chapter. But the
fact that many people who are making better money are willing to share their
gains with charities and other groups is a positive sign for the future.
Corporations Will Jump on the Cause-
Related Marketing Bandwagon
Corporations have begun to realize that aligning themselves with a cause
can’t only up their image among the buying public, but also can offer lucrative

benefits in marketing punch. When you approach corporations in the future,
consider the marketing angle of your proposal; for example:
 Think of a company-sponsored event that would get their name and logo
out there in a positive way.
 Could you interest the corporation in a promotion where a portion of
what they get for their products goes into your coffers? They get new
customers and higher sales that far outweigh the amount they hand
over to you from their sales.
 Would the company like to place your logo on their promotional materi-
als, attracting the buyer who has sympathy for your cause, and pay you
a royalty for the use of your name?
These types of comarketing ventures will get more and more popular as cor-
porations look for a quid pro quo for their charitable efforts.
HUGE Amounts of Wealth
Will Be Transferred
Estimates are that a minimum of $40.6 trillion and as much as $136 trillion
will transfer over the next 50 years from all adults alive today to their heirs,
charities, taxes, and other recipients. Scholars base this prediction on
assumptions about the huge baby boomer population that is entering the
point in their lives when estate planning, the drafting of wills, and the passing
on of wealth will become critical issues. The numbers are also based on
assumptions about the U.S. stock market and the dramatic appreciation of
investments that have taken place during the past 20 years. Also enhancing
the situation is the fact that modern technology and communication have
made stock ownership and other assets that appreciate or grow in value over
time available to a huge part of the U.S. population through online brokerages
and other mechanisms. More than 40 percent of the population has a stake in
the stock market, up from barely 30 percent just 25 years ago.
Givers Will Become More Savvy
Through the Internet people have gained access to a wealth of advice and
information. Legal sites provide articles and even ready-to-buy kits for making
out wills, creating trusts, and planning for your estate. Books abound about
how to handle your money, many giving advice about the tax advantages of
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

giving or structuring your estate to leave bequests to charities or other causes.
In short, givers may become more and more savvy about when and why to
give, so you will have to do your homework to keep up.
That’s not to say that people will go it entirely alone. A huge cadre of profes-
sional lawyers, accountants, investment advisors and estate planners are
beginning to cultivate a vast new market of potential givers. These individuals
are providing the expert advice that creates new contributions to the nonprofit
sector.
The various giving mechanisms we cover in this book will be the tools that
these professionals use, and their personal relationship with clients will have
a major impact on fundraising and philanthropic giving.
Early indications are that the use of private foundations, the setting up of trust
accounts with community foundations, bequests in wills to philanthropic
organizations, and the creation of the various trust instruments spelled out
in Chapter 21 are proliferating.
So it seems likely that this growing accumulation of wealth and increasingly
informed donors could result in increased giving. If it does, the historic rate
of personal giving as a percent of personal income may grow. It has remained
at approximately 1.8 percent, on average, for three decades.
Fundraising Costs Will Be Scrutinized
The relationship between the amount of money given and the percent that
actually goes to the charitable cause for which it was solicited has received
growing attention.
In the summer of 2004, the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance Hearings focused
on nonprofit governance and charity integrity. A report that same year from
the Brookings Institute showed that only 11 percent of Americans felt that non-
profits spend money wisely. State governments are looking at nonprofit respon-
sibility as well. In January of 2005, California enacted a Nonprofit Integrity Act
that called for annual audits to be made publicly available.
For that reason, the importance of communicating clearly and honestly —
how much money is raised, how much it costs to raise the money, and how
much of the money is actually spent for the organization’s mission — will
become increasingly important for nonprofit organizations.
Without any question, however, the long-term relationship between a donor
and the organization soliciting funds is the key ingredient in creating trust.

Many organizations are adopting a version of the Preserving the Public Trust
Initiative started by the Donors Forum of Chicago. Adherence to the princi-
ples in this document helps to reassure potential donors of your standards
and practices. You can get a copy of this list of fundraising best practices at
www.donorsforum.org/publictrust/principles.html.
Nonprofits Will Go Commercial!
Burton A. Weisbrod, a Northwestern University professor, published a book
entitled To Profit or Not to Profit, The Commercial Transformation of the Non-
Profit Sector (Cambridge University Press). The author believes that the com-
mercialization of many parts of the nonprofit world is inevitable. He cites
decreases in governmental and contributed funding that force nonprofits to
sell something — often in competition with for-profit organizations. Weisbrod
points out that the nonprofit sector has been both criticized and acclaimed.
He writes, “The rationale for its special tax treatment and subsidies rest on
the belief that it provides services that are materially different from and pre-
ferred to the services that private enterprise provides.” If demand for those
services goes up and traditional funding sources are not available, then com-
mercialization occurs.
Thus, the prediction is that nonprofits will dramatically increase their use of
revenues other than voluntary contributions. As that happens, the interaction
and relationship of nonprofits and the rest of the economy becomes more
common. In some cases, the drive for revenue is bringing nonprofits into
headlong competition with private enterprise. This is especially true for 
hospitals, universities, and some social service providers. For example, the
nonprofit YMCA and YWCA in some cases find themselves in direct competi-
tion with for-profit recreational organizations.
In addition to competition between nonprofit and for-profit ventures, you’re
likely to see increased cooperation and blurring of the lines between them as
well. For example, government may rely on nonprofits to implement certain
government programs rather than attempt to do the work itself. Nonprofit
universities conduct scientific research for the benefit of private firms.
Universities also enter into major deals with private companies that sell ath-
letic equipment and other products that could benefit from an alliance with
the university’s reputation. In other words, the private sector has already
found a way to profit from the aura and reputation of the nonprofit sector.
Nowhere in the economy is it more obvious that competition and coopera-
tion are taking place between nonprofits and for-profits than in the health
care industry where nonprofit hospitals advertise for business, cooperate
with for-profit ventures when advantageous, and ardently compete when 
necessary.
344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Even though a nonprofit may become more commercial or competitive, the
nonprofit does not necessarily break faith with the core values or primary
reason the nonprofit was created in the first place. The two can coexist.
Women Will Become a Bigger Force
in Giving
Today, women own more than half of all investments in America. As they age,
their salaries will increase, and in the same time period, they will inherit
wealth from parents and spouses. In fact, 85 percent of women will control
their family’s wealth at some point in their lives, according to the Woman’s
Philanthropy Institute.
This means that you should spend some time and effort on understanding
how to find and cultivate female donors. What types of causes do they tend
to support? What kind of financial concerns do they have that may differ
from their husband’s, father’s, or brother’s? What will they want to leave as
a legacy when they pass on?
Nonprofits Will Become For-Profit
The ultimate extension of commercialism is the conversion of nonprofits into
commercial ventures. Although the Internal Revenue Service, through its reg-
ular auditing procedure, may suspend the tax status of a nonprofit and thus
convert it to a for-profit venture, the more likely conversions will take place
voluntarily by nonprofits who find that the nonprofit structure and the rules
and regulations that go with it make it difficult to compete.
Conversion of mutual insurance companies and healthcare providers to for-
profit status has become commonplace. These conversions are usually the
result of decisions by management that the mission of the organization can
best be met in the for-profit world. For example, conversion makes it possible
for the company to seek different kinds of financing from the for-profit mar-
ketplace. In addition to voluntary conversions, some states have attempted
to define nonprofits by requiring a certain percentage of revenue to be con-
tributed income or that a certain percent of revenues received should be
used for philanthropic purposes. Although no consensus exists on what’s rea-
sonable, it is clear that some nonprofits will find it necessary to convert to
for-profit status.
345
Chapter 24: Ten Predictions about Fundraising

Giving Goes Global
As the world becomes a smaller place, and disasters on the other side of the
world seem to be very close to home, you’ll see more giving on a global level.
The Indonesian tsunami relief effort in 2004/2005 caused unprecedented giving,
as did charitable giving in response to the World Trade Center attacks in 2001.
People from around the world put geography aside as they are shown the 
disaster by every kind of media, from video clips on the news and the Internet
to blogs and photos.
In fact, in 2004 there was a 16 percent median growth in new donors to the
international relief sector, according to one Target Analysis Group study. This
growth was no doubt largely due to the Asian tsunami.
Disasters such as these will continue to draw millions of dollars to their
causes. That makes it all the more important that you have a strong, consis-
tent donor base that plans to give you a gift year after year, even if they also
give to the Red Cross or other group in times of unique disaster.
E-Giving Will Grow
E-giving has begun to have an impact and will become commonplace in the
decade ahead. Click-and-mortar will be the combination for successfully 
marketing nonprofit causes. In other words, it will be important to have a
conveniently located brick-and-mortar location where the nonprofit function
takes place. But a click on the Internet is likely to be the simplest and easiest
way to get a contribution.
This is even truer for time-sensitive disaster relief, where people feel that
they must contribute today to be part of a bigger effort to get help where it
needs to go right away. The ease of quickly donating on the Internet plays
into this kind of urgency.
346

Chapter 25
Ten Great Opening Lines
In This Chapter
 Hooking the donor right away
 Showing donors the good they can do and have done
 Identifying with the donor
T
ry these lines when you meet a prospective donor.
“Have you seen our new baby elephant?”
Get the donor hooked, right away. What does he care about? What interests
him? Capture his imagination as soon as you can, and he’ll be waiting for
your next word.
“Hi Mrs. Jones, I just left a meeting
where we were discussing . . .”
This natural comment can lead right into whatever you want to address with
Mrs. Jones — a new program, a building, a campaign, whatever. You don’t
want to flounder around here, or leave the impression that you are making
it up just to create a graceful transition into what you really want to talk
about, so only use this statement when it’s true. You may, of course,
change it to “I was just thinking about . . .” or “We were just talking about
planning. . . .”

“Recently I visited the people putting on
the program you sponsored. The program
was phenomenal! I really think you
should see it sometime.”
Not only does this line get the donor’s imagination going, but it also recognizes
him for his past donation and invites him to see the results.
“Now, how can I help you?”
This may get a baffled look and the comment, “I thought that you wanted
something from me!” But it does open the door to the idea that fundraisers
really do help donors find positive and proven ways to facilitate good in the
world and meet their financial planning goals, as well.
“Research shows that giving is good
for your health.”
Said to the right people (like a group of doctors), this opening line gets people
listening right off the bat. Why? First of all, we want it to be true. Second, it
tells donors right up front that their philanthropic endeavors will benefit
them. If nothing else, the donor will continue listening just so he can look for
an opportunity to disprove you.
“You have no idea how much good your
last gift did for our organization!”
Recognition is a good thing — especially when there’s something substantial
you can say about the results of the donor’s past contributions.
Misrepresentation is never the best policy. Don’t get in to see a donor under
false pretenses. Acting like you’re conducting a survey at a festival when
you’re really looking for an opportunity to promote your organization only
creates distance between you and the prospective donor. Use your opportu-
nities, certainly, but do it in a forthright manner.
348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

“More people go to zoos today than go
to all sports activities combined.”
This is a “Gee Whiz!” statement that really gets people interested. What kind
of “Gee whiz!” statements can you come up with about your own organiza-
tion? Take an afternoon and research trivia or statistics related to your area.
The Internet offers great tools for this. The interest you’ll gain — and the con-
versations that happen — will be more than worth the expense of your
research time.
“Seven out of ten Indianapolis
families use United Way services
in their lifetime.”
This is another “Gee whiz!” statement that is based on fact and may appeal
to both logical and emotional types. Know the good your organization has
done and be willing to talk about it. Distill the facts down to three or four
good opening lines that may interest the prospective donor and leave him
wanting to find out more about what you do.
Personal visits are important. People find it very hard to turn down the
person who is looking them in the eye.
“Hey — I just received this great picture!
The new wing of the library is finished!”
Especially for people who have already given to your organization, seeing evi-
dence of great new things is very heady stuff. Show donors a picture of the
new elephant, display the newly purchased property, or of the recent turnout
at the fundraising event you sponsored.
The Web isn’t the same direct-contact medium as face-to-face visiting, but
you can put images on your Web page that show happy people doing good
work and suggest your prospective donor visit the site.
349
Chapter 25: Ten Great Opening Lines

“Cute dog!”
Hey, what’s the best way to a pet lover’s heart? Like his dog! It may seem like
an old salesmanship gimmick, but there’s an important idea at the center:
Identification is key. When your donor realizes that you and he share some
common interests, he starts listening.
