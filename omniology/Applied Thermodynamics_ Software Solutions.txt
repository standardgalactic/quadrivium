Preface
PREFACE
This book, viz. “Applied Thermodynamics: Software solutions – Vapor Power cycles 
(Rankine cycle)” is a supplement to the Part-II of the popular, free ebook series on Applied 
Thermodynamics: Software Solutions by the same author, published by Bookboon.
In this book, as with other books of this series, the focus is on the solutions of problems 
using computer software. Only the essential theory and summary of equations required for 
calculations are given at the beginning of the chapter. 
Here, we have particularly focused on solving problems with the very useful software, 
Mathcad. Since Mathcad does not have built-in functions to determine the properties water/
steam, we have first written useful functions for properties of water/steam using data from 
NIST. Then, we demonstrate the ease with which one can do calculations, produce tables 
and graphs of results, and perform ‘what-if analysis’ with Mathcad, by solving a variety 
of problems.
Advantages of using computer software to solve problems are reiterated:
1.	It helps in solving the problems fast and accurately 
ii.	Parametric analysis (what-if analysis) and graphical visualization is done very easily. 
This helps in an in-depth analysis of the problem. 
iii.	Once a particular type of problem is solved, it can be used as a template and solving 
similar problems later becomes extremely easy. 
iv.	In addition, one can plot the data, curve fit, write functions for various properties 
or calculations and re-use them. 
v.	 These possibilities create interest, curiosity and wonder in the minds of students 
and enthuse them to know more and work more.
Useful data for water/steam are generated from NIST website, i.e.
http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/.
And, using the NIST data, Mathcad Functions are written for both saturation properties 
of water and superheated steam properties. These Functions are then used in solving 
problems, illustrating the ease of using Mathcad in calculations and graphing. Further, 
the Mathcad programs are given clearly and transparently, so that the students, teachers, 
researchers and professionals can reproduce them for their works.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION
Mathcad does not have built-in functions for properties of Water/steam.
So, we have written Mathcad Functions for properties of Water/Steam, that are essential 
for problem solving.
H2O/Steam properties are generated from NIST website [1], i.e. 
http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/
Procedure to use the above NIST website to get both the saturation properties and 
superheat gas properties for different fluids is explained in detail in the earlier free ebook 
by this author (See pp. 40–48 and pp. 60–66 of that book), published by Bookboon:

Another type of feed water heater is the ‘closed’ type. Generally, this heater is of a shell 
and tube arrangement, where the extracted steam condenses over the tubes inside which the 
feed water to be heated flows. The condensate is dealt with in one of the following ways:
a)	The condensate is pumped to a higher pressure and is sent forward to mix with the 
feed water in a mixing chamber, or 
b)	The condensate is throttled to a lower pressure in a ‘trap’ and sent back to the 
condenser or to one of the previous heaters.

Second law analysis enables us to find out where in the cycle the irreversibilities occur and 
what their magnitudes are.
Exergy destruction for a steady flow system is given by:
On a unit mass basis, for a one inlet, one exit, steady flow device, we have:
where Tbin and Tbout are the temps at system boundary where heat is transferred in to and 
out of the system respectively.
For a cycle with heat transfers at a source temp TH and sink temp TL, exergy destruction

And exergy of flow for a fluid stream at a state (P, T) is determined from:
where (h, s) are enthalpy and entropy at state (P,T), and (h0, s0) are enthalpy and entropy at 
ambient conditions of (P0, T0). Temp should be in Kelvin. V is the velocity in m/s and Z is 
the elevation in meters. Generally, for the cases we come across, V and Z are taken as zero.
2.11	 SECOND LAW EFFICIENCY, ηII[9]: 
Thermal efficiency for heat engines and coefficient of performance for refrigerators are based 
on the first law of thermodynamics and referred to as the first-law efficiencies. 
Second-law efficiency is defined based on II Law:
The second-law efficiency for a heat engine is defined as the ratio of the useful work output 
to the maximum possible work output (for work-producing device, such as turbine), or the 
ratio of the minimum work input to the actual useful work input (for work-consuming 
device, such as compressor). 
For refrigerators or heat Pumps, it is defined as the ratio of the actual COP to the COP of 
reversible process. For mixing chambers, the second-law efficiency is defined as the ratio of 
the exergy recovered to the exergy supplied.

From an energy balance, neglecting kinetic and potential energy differences compared to 
the enthalpy change of the fluid, we get: 
The reversible work for adiabatic turbine, the reversible work equals the difference of the 
flow exergies at the inlet and the exit:
Then, second-law efficiency of an adiabatic turbine is given by:
Similarly, second-law efficiency of a mixing chamber is:
Similarly, second-law efficiency of a compressor is:
ηII = (efi – efe) / (hi – he)

Exergy balance: Exergy losses can be found out for a given component by making an exergy 
balance for that component.
Exergy balance is written for each component of a system to find out the relative magnitudes 
of ‘exergy losses’ in those components so that corrective action can be taken to reduce the 
losses.
Writing the exergy balance for components of a steady flow system, such as compressors, 
turbines, throttle valves, heat exchangers etc is as follows[6]:

PROBLEMS SOLVED 
WITH MATHCAD
Note:
Generally, while solving problems on vapor power cycles which use Water/Steam as working 
substance, we have to refer to tables often to get properties of water/steam at various 
state points.
Instead of using property tables, here, we shall first develop few simple Mathcad 
Functions for water/steam based on NIST data:
Ref: http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/, and then use them in solving problems. 
These Functions use the built-in linear interpolation function ‘linterp’ in Mathcad to get 
interpolated properties.

Explanation of the Function:
In the Function below, P and T are the inputs, and h and s are the outputs.
If the input P value exactly matches with one of the values in the Pressures_H2O data vector, 
that particular Matrix is accessed and the h and s are found out by linear interpolation.
However, if the input P does not exactly match with any of the values in the Pressures_H2O 
data vector, then the pressures PL and PH which bracket P are found out, and the h and s 
are first calculated for pressures corresponding to PL and PH, and then the h and s values 
at the required P are found out by linear interpolation:

Explanation for the above Function:
This function gives all the important parameters of performance of Ideal Rankine cycle.
First line is the LHS of the Function, and defines the Function. Quantities inside brackets 
are the inputs, where temperature T1 is in deg.C and pressures P_cond and P_boiler are 
in kPa. Outputs are presented compactly in a Matrix in the last step on the RHS. In the 
output matrix, we have: Turbine work (w_T), Pump work (w_P), Net work (w_net), Heat 
input in boiler (q_in), Heat rejected in condenser (q_out), Thermal efficiency (effcy), quality 
of steam at turbine exit (×2), Specific Steam Consumption (SSC) and Work Ratio. Units 
of each quantity are also given in output. 
The line structure is the RHS of the Function.
Each step therein is explained below in the same order:
•	 Sat. temp T2 in condenser is calculated, knowing the P_cond
•	 h3, the sat. liq. enthalpy at point 3, i.e. at entry to pump is calculated
•	 s3, the sat. liq. entropy at entry to pump is calculated
•	 vf3, the sp. vol. of sat. liq. at entry to pump is calculated

First line is the LHS of the Function, and defines the Function. Quantities inside brackets 
are the inputs, where temperature T1 is in deg.C and pressures P_cond and P_boiler are in 
kPa, and eta_T and eta_P are the isentropic efficiencies of the turbine and pump respectively. 
Outputs are presented compactly in a Matrix in the last step on the RHS. In the output 
matrix, we have: Turbine work (w_T), Pump work (w_P), Net work (w_net), Heat input

steam at turbine exit (T3), Specific Steam Consumption (SSC) and Work Ratio. Units of 
each quantity are also given in output. 
Prob. 3.8 A steam power plant operates on Rankine cycle, with boiler pressure of 15 MPa 
and condenser pressure of 10 kPa. Steam enters the turbine at 600 C. For turbine, isentropic 
effcy = 0.87 and for pump, isentropic effcy = 0.85, find the thermal effcy of the plant. Also 
find the power output if the mass flow rate of steam = 15 kg/s.

Explanation for the above Function:
This function gives all the important parameters of performance of an Ideal, Reheat 
Rankine cycle.
This function is similar to the Function written earlier for parameters of Ideal Rankine 
cycle, except that now, we check if the exit of HP turbine is in two phase region or 
superheat region, and determine the enthalpy accordingly.
First line is the LHS of the Function, and defines the Function. Quantities inside brackets 
are the inputs, where Turbine inlet temperature T1 and reheat temp T3 are in deg.C and 
pressures P_cond, P_boiler and reheat pressure P2 are in kPa. Outputs are presented compactly 
in a Matrix in the last step on the RHS. In the output matrix, we have: Turbine work 
(w_T), Pump work (w_P), Net work (w_net), Heat input in boiler (q_in), Heat rejected 
in condenser (q_out), Thermal efficiency (effcy), quality of steam at LP turbine exit (×4), 
quality of steam at HP turbine exit (×2) or its Temp (T2), and Specific Steam Consumption 
(SSC). Units of each quantity are also given in output. 
Prob.3.13 In an ideal steam reheat cycle, steam enters the high pressure turbine at 3.5 
MPa, 400 C and expands to 0.8 MPa. It is then reheated to 400 C and expands to 10 
kPa in the low pressure turbine. Calculate the cycle thermal efficiency and the moisture 
content of the steam leaving the low pressure turbine. Also, plot the variation of efficiency 
and dryness fraction, ×4 as reheat pressure P2 varies from 600 kPa to 1500 kPa, other 
conditions remaining the same.[3]

Prob.3.14 A steam power plant operates on an ideal reheat Rankine cycle. Steam enters 
the HP turbine at 15 MPa, 600 C, and is condensed in the condenser at 10 kPa. If the 
moisture content of steam at the exit of LP turbine is not to exceed 10%, determine the 
reheat pressure and the thermal efficiency of the cycle. Assume that the steam is reheated 
to 600 C.[2]
Solution:
We shall assume a trial value for reheat pressure P2 and apply the Mathcad Function 
written earlier.
Obviously, quality_×4 in the output will not be 0.9 as required. Then we shall use the 
‘Solve block’ of Mathcad to determine P2 such that quality_×4 is 0.9:
Applying the Mathcad Function written above straightaway:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Prob. 3.18 In a reheat cycle power plant, steam enters the HP turbine at 5 MPa, 450 C 
and expands to 0.5 MPa, after which it is reheated to 450 C. The steam is then expanded 
through the LP turbine to 7.5 kPa. Liquid water leaving the condenser is pumped to 5 
MPa and returned to steam generator. Each turbine has an isentropic effcy of 87% and a 
pump effcy of 82%. If the total power output of turbine is 10 MW, determine the mass 
flow rate of steam, the pump power input, and the thermal effcy of the power plant. [3]

Note: Start with a trial value for P_cond and apply the Function; obviously, the quality 
at exit of turbine, x6 will not be 0.9. So, apply the ‘Solve block’ of Mathcad to get the 
correct value of P_cond to have x6 = 0.9. Then, with this new value of P_cond, apply the

Applying the Mathcad Function written above:
Now, the quality x6 is 0.94. So, apply the “solve block’ of Mathcad to get x6 = 0.95:

cycle, and here also we check if the exits of both stages of turbine are in two phase 
region or superheat region, and determine the enthalpies accordingly.
First line is the LHS of the Function, and defines the Function. Quantities inside brackets 
are the inputs, where Turbine inlet temperature is in deg.C and pressures P_cond, P_boiler 
and extraction pressure P2 are in kPa. Outputs are presented compactly in a Matrix in 
the last step on the RHS. In the output matrix, we have: Turbine work (w_T), Pump 
works (w_P1 and w_P2), Net work (w_net), Heat input in boiler (q_in), Heat rejected in 
condenser (q_out), Thermal efficiency (effcy), Specific Steam Consumption (SSC), fraction 
of extracted stream (y), and the quality of steam at turbine exit (x3) if the exit steam is in 
two phase region, or its temp (T3) if the exit steam is in superheat region. Units of each 
quantity are also given in output.

First line is the LHS of the Function, and defines the Function. Quantities inside brackets 
are the inputs, where Turbine inlet temperature is in deg.C and pressures P_cond, P_boiler 
and extraction pressure P2 are in kPa. Isentropic efficiencies of turbine stages and of pump 
are eta_T and eta_P respectively. Outputs are presented compactly in a Matrix in the last 
step on the RHS. In the output matrix, we have: Turbine work (w_T), Pump works (w_P1 
and w_P2), Net work (w_net), Heat input in boiler (q_in), Heat rejected in condenser 
(q_out), Thermal efficiency (effcy), Specific Steam Consumption (SSC), fraction of extracted 
stream (y), and the quality of steam at turbine exit (x5) if the exit steam is in two phase 
region, or its temp (T5) if the exit steam is in superheat region. Units of each quantity are 
also given in output. 
Prob. 3.31 Consider a regenerative vapor power cycle with one open feedwater heater. Steam 
enters the turbine at 8.0 MPa, 480_C and expands to 0.7 MPa, where some of the steam 
is extracted and diverted to the open feedwater heater operating at 0.7 MPa. The remaining 
steam expands through the second-stage turbine to the condenser pressure of 0.008 MPa. 
Saturated liquid exits the open feedwater heater at 0.7 MPa. The isentropic efficiency of 
each turbine stage is 85% and each pump operates isentropically.
If the net power output of the cycle is 100 MW, determine:
(a) the thermal efficiency, and (b) the mass flow rate of steam entering the first turbine 
stage, in kg/h. [4]

Prob. 3.33 Steam at 30 bar and 350 C is supplied to a steam turbine in a practical 
regenerative cycle and the steam is bled at 4 bar.The bled steam comes out as dry saturated 
steam and heats the feed water in an open type FWH to its saturated liquid state. The 
rest of the steam in the turbine expands to a condenser pressure of 0.1 bar. Assuming the 
turbine effcy. to be the same before and after bleeding, determine: (a) the turbine effcy 
(b) steam quality at inlet to condenser (c) mass flow rate of bled steam per unit mass flow 
rate at turbine inlet, and (d) the cycle effcy. [VTU]

Explanation for the above Function:
This function gives all the important parameters of performance of an Ideal Regenerative 
Rankine cycle with one closed FWH. Condensed extracted steam from the closed FWH 
is throttled and sent back to the condenser (or, the previous low pressure heater).
This function is similar to the Functions written earlier for other variations of Rankine 
cycle, and here also we check if the exits of both stages of turbine are in two phase 
region or superheat region, and determine the enthalpies accordingly. 
First line is the LHS of the Function, and defines the Function. Quantities inside brackets 
are the inputs, where Turbine inlet temperature is in deg.C and pressures P_cond, P_boiler 
and extraction pressure P2 are in kPa. T6 (deg.C) is the temperature of feedwater going out 
of the closed feedwater heater, before it enters the boiler. Outputs are presented compactly 
in a Matrix in the last step on the RHS. In the output matrix, we have: Turbine work 
(w_T), Pump work (w_P), Condenser temp. T_cond, Net work (w_net), Heat input in 
boiler (q_in), Heat rejected in condenser (q_out), Thermal efficieny (effcy), fraction of 
extracted stream (y), and the quality of steam at turbine exit (x3) if the exit steam is in 
two phase region, or its temp (T3) if the exit steam is in superheat region. Units of each 
quantity are also given in output.

Problems solved with Mathcad
Prob. 3.37 A power plant operates on a regenerative vapor power cycle with one closed 
feedwater heater. Steam enters the first turbine stage at 120 bar, 520 C and expands to 
10 bar, where some of the steam is extracted and diverted to a closed feedwater heater. 
Condensate exiting the feedwater heater as saturated liquid at 10 bar passes through a trap 
into the condenser. The feedwater exits the heater at 120 bar with a temperature of 170 C. 
The condenser pressure is 0.06 bar. For isentropic processes in each turbine stage and the 
pump, determine for the cycle (a) the thermal efficiency and (b) the mass flow rate into 
the first-stage turbine, in kg/h, if the net power developed is 320 MW. [4]

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Prob. 3.39 A power plant operates on an Ideal reheat-regenerative Rankine cycle and 
has a net power output (W⋅net) of 100 MW. Steam enters the high pressure turbine stage 
at 12 MPa, 550°C and leaves at 0.9 MPa. Some steam is extracted at 0.9 MPa to heat the 
feedwater in an open feedwater heater with the water leaving the FWH as saturated liquid. 
The rest of the steam is reheated to 500oC and is expanded in the low pressure turbine to 
the condenser at a pressure of 8 kPa. Determine (a) the thermal efficiency (ηth) of the cycle 
and (b) the mass flow rate (m⋅) of steam through the boiler. (c) plot the thermal effcy for 
boiler pressures of 3 to 12 MPa, and (d) what would the thermal efficiency be if the steam 
entered the turbine at 15 MPa? [8]

Explanation for the above Function:
This function gives exergy destroyed in various processes of an Ideal Rankine cycle. 
First line is the LHS of the Function, and defines the Function. Quantities inside brackets 
are the inputs, where pressures P_cond, P_boiler are in kPa. Turbine inlet temperature,T1, 
Source temp for heat supplied in boiler, TH, Sink temp for heat rejected in condenser, TL, 
are in deg.C and ambient conditions are (P0, T0). Outputs are presented compactly in a 
Matrix in the last step on the RHS. In the output matrix, we have: Net work (w_net), Heat 
input in boiler (q_in), Heat rejected in condenser (q_out), Thermal efficieny (eta), quality 
of steam at turbine exit (x2), Exergy destroyed in boiler (X_dest_boiler), Exergy destroyed 
in condenser (X_dest_cond), Exergy destroyed in cycle (X_dest_cycle), and Exergy of flow 
of steam leaving the boiler (ef1). Units of each quantity are also given in output. 
Prob.3.43 Consider a steam power plant that operates on a simple ideal Rankine cycle. 
Steam enters the turbine at 10 MPa and 500°C and is cooled in the condenser at a pressure 
of 10 kPa. Determine (a) the quality of the steam at the turbine exit, (b) the thermal 
efficiency of the cycle, (c) exergy destroyed in boiler, condenser, and the cycle, and (d) exergy 
of flow at turbine exit. Take TH = 1500 K, and TL = 290 K. Ambient conditions: P0 = 
101.3 kPa, T0 = 290 K. [2]

Now, apply the Mathcad Function for exergy losses in Ideal, simple, Rankine cycle, and 
get all parameters immediately:
Thus:
Qualityof steam at turbine exit = x2 = 0.793…Ans.
Cycle effcy = 0.402 = 40.2%…Ans.
Exergy destroyed in boiler = 1112 kJ/kg…Ans.
Exergy destroyed in condenser = 171.973 kJ/kg…Ans.
Exergy destroyed in cycle = 1284 kJ/kg…Ans.
Exergy of flow at turbine exit = ef1 = 1463 kJ/kg…Ans. 
Note: 
1.	Exergy of flow at turbine exit ef1, is obtained in the above Mathcad Function, by 
using the earlier Function written to find the Exergy of flow.
2.	Exergy destroyed in Turbine and pump are zero since the processes in those 
components are isentropic.
Plot the exergy destroyed in boiler, condenser and the cycle as boiler pressure varies 
from 2 MPa to 12 MPa:

Prob.3.44 Consider a steam power plant that operates on a simple ideal Rankine cycle and 
has a net power output of 45 MW. Steam enters the turbine at 7 MPa and 500°C and is 
cooled in the condenser at a pressure of 10 kPa by running cooling water (cp = 4.18 kJ/
kg.C) from a lake through the tubes of the condenser at a rate of 2000 kg/s. Determine 
(a) the thermal efficiency of the cycle, (b) the mass flow rate of the steam, and (c) the 
temperature rise of the cooling water. Determine the exergy destruction associated with the 
heat rejection process. Assume a source temperature of 1500 K and a sink temperature of 
290 K. Also, determine the exergy of the steam at the boiler exit. Take P0 = 100 kPa. [2]

Explanation for the above Function:
This function gives exergy destroyed in various processes of an Ideal Reheat Rankine cycle. 
First line is the LHS of the Function, and defines the Function. Quantities inside brackets 
are the inputs, where pressures P_cond, P_boiler and the reheat pressure P2 are in kPa. 
Turbine inlet temperature,T1, Reheat temp. T3, Source temp for heat supplied in boiler, 
TH, Sink temp for heat rejected in condenser, TL, are in deg.C and ambient conditions 
are (P0, T0). Outputs are presented compactly in a Matrix in the last step on the RHS. In 
the output matrix, we have: Net work (w_net), Heat input in boiler (q_in), Heat rejected 
in condenser (q_out), Thermal efficieny (eta), quality of steam at turbine exit (x4), Exergy 
destroyed in boiler( X_dest_boiler), Exergy destroyed in reheater (X_dest_reheater), Exergy 
destroyed in condenser (X_dest_cond), and Exergy destroyed in cycle (X_dest_cycle). Units 
of each quantity are also given in output. 
Prob.3.48 A steam power plant operates on the ideal reheat Rankine cycle. Steam enters 
the high pressure turbine at 8 MPa and 500°C and leaves at 3 MPa. Steam is then reheated 
at constant pressure to 500°C before it expands to 20 kPa in the low-pressure turbine. 
Determine the net work output, in kJ/kg, and the thermal efficiency of the cycle. [2]

Problems solved with Mathcad
Prob.3.50 Consider a steam power plant that operates on a reheat Rankine cycle and has a 
net power output of 80 MW. Steam enters the high-pressure turbine at 10 MPa and 500°C 
and the low-pressure turbine at 1 MPa and 500°C. Steam leaves the condenser as a saturated 
liquid at a pressure of 10 kPa. The isentropic efficiency of the turbine is 80 percent, and that 
of the pump is 95 percent. Determine (a) the quality (or temperature, if superheated) of the 
steam at the turbine exit, (b) the thermal efficiency of the cycle, and (c) the mass flow rate 
of the steam. Determine the exergy destruction associated with the heat addition process 
and the expansion process. Assume a source temperature of 1600 K and a sink temperature 
of 285 K. Also, determine the exergy of steam at the boiler exit. Take P0 = 100 kPa. [2]
Note: This problem is the same as Prob. 3.20, except for exergy aspects.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Explanation for the above Function:
This function gives exergy destroyed in various processes of an Ideal Regenerative 
Rankine cycle. 
First line is the LHS of the Function, and defines the Function. Quantities inside brackets 
are the inputs, where pressures P_cond, P_boiler and the extraction pressure (or feedwater 
heater pressure), P2 are in kPa. Turbine inlet temperature,T1, Source temp for heat supplied 
in boiler, TH, Sink temp for heat rejected in condenser, TL, are in deg.C and ambient 
conditions are (P0, T0). Outputs are presented compactly in a Matrix in the last step on the 
RHS. In the output matrix, we have: Net work (w_net), Heat input in boiler (q_in), Heat 
rejected in condenser (q_out), Thermal efficieny (eta), fraction of steam extracted (y), Exergy 
destroyed in boiler( X_dest_boiler), Exergy destroyed in open FWH (X_dest_OpenFWH), 
Exergy destroyed in condenser (X_dest_cond), and Exergy destroyed in cycle (X_dest_cycle). 
Units of each quantity are also given in output. 
Prob.3.52 A steam power plant operates on an ideal, regenerative Rankine cycle. Steam 
enters the turbine at 6 MPa and 450°C and is condensed in the condenser at 20 kPa. Steam 
is extracted from the turbine at 0.4 MPa to heat the feedwater in an open feedwater heater. 
Water leaves the feedwater heater as a saturated liquid. Determine (a) the net work output 
per kilogram of steam flowing through the boiler and (b) the thermal efficiency of the cycle.
Also: determine the exergy destruction associated with this regenerative cycle. Assume a 
source temperature of 1500 K and a sink temperature of 290 K.[2]

1 MPa, where some of the steam is extracted and diverted to the open feedwater heater 
operating at 1 MPa. The remaining steam expands through the second turbine stage to the 
condenser pressure of 6 kPa. Saturated liquid exits the open feedwater heater at 1 MPa. For 
isentropic processes in the turbines and pumps, determine for the cycle:
(a) the thermal efficiency and (b) the mass flow rate into the first turbine stage, in kg/h, 
for a net power output of 330 MW.
Plot the thermal efficiency and the rate of exergy destruction within the feedwater heater, in 
kW, versus the feedwater heater pressure ranging from 0.5 to 10 MPa. Let T0 = 293 K. [4]

Prob.3.55 A steam power plant operates on an ideal reheat-regenerative Rankine cycle and 
has a net power output of 80 MW. Steam enters the high-pressure turbine at 10 MPa and 
550°C and leaves at 0.8 MPa. Some steam is extracted at this pressure to heat the feedwater 
in an open feedwater heater. The rest of the steam is reheated to 500°C and is expanded in 
the low-pressure turbine to the condenser pressure of 10 kPa. Determine (a) the mass flow 
rate of steam through the boiler and (b) the thermal efficiency of the cycle. Determine the 
exergy destruction in the reheater and open FWH. Assume a source temperature of 1800 K 
and a sink temperature of 290 K. [2]
