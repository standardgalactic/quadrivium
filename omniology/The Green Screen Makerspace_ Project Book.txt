Foreword
vii
I met Todd Burleson at the EdTech Summit in Boston in 2015. I was 
demonstrating our newly released Green Screen by Do Ink app for 
the iPad and iPhone. Todd is a former third and fourth grade classroom 
teacher who a year after our meeting was named the 2016 School Librarian 
of the Year. This award is given by the School Library Journal and sponsored 
by Scholastic Library Publishing to honor K–12 “school library professionals 
for outstanding achievement and the exemplary use of 21st-century tools to 
engage students toward fostering multiple literacies.” Todd’s book, The Green 
Screen Makerspace Project Book, reflects his passion for learning and is a 
wonderful introduction to green screening. It’s a compilation of authentic 
classroom projects that will help you get started with green screening and spur 
your imagination as to all the ways green screening can be used to engage students.
You know what a green screen effect is, right? It’s used in the movies to make 
it look like the actors have landed on an alien planet, and it’s used on television 
to make it look like your local news announcer is standing in front of a weather 
map. The green screen effect works by combining images from multiple sources 
into a single video or photo. The genesis of our Green Screen by Do Ink app came 
from a teacher at EdCamp Boston in 2013 who mentioned a need for an easy-
to-use green screen app. She wanted to teach a weather segment and needed the 
app to be easy enough for her second grade students to use. As cofounder of Do 
Ink, an educational app company, I recognized the need to involve teachers early 
in our development process and to test the results in classrooms. This input was 
invaluable. We launched our Green Screen by Do Ink app, and two weeks after its 
launch, Apple selected it as a “Best New App in Education.” Fast forward four 
years, and we were amazed at the endless ways green screening is used in 
classrooms throughout the world. 
Green screening used to be difficult and time-consuming and required expensive 
equipment. Now it can be done without fancy studio setups using inexpensive 
software on tablets, phones, and computers. Green fabric, green tablecloths, green-
painted pizza boxes and trifolds, green file folders, and even green Play-Doh have 
been used as green screens to great success in the classroom. The popularity of 
green screens in the classroom is due to the fact that they immerse students in their 

viii            Foreword
learning. One minute they can be in China on the Great Wall and the next, exploring 
the moon. 
This book is a wonderful introduction to using green screens in education and 
illustrates with sample projects ways it can be used in twenty-first-century classrooms. I 
hope this book will inspire you to try green screening because it is a fun and innovative 
way for students to be creative and to communicate their learning because it promotes 
student collaboration, critical thinking, and problem solving.

Acknowledgments
Writing a book can be both a communal and solitary undertaking. To that end I would 
like to thank some of the folks who have been a part of this process. I couldn’t have 
even begun this process without Colleen and Aaron Graves. They recommended me to 
my editor Michael McCabe because of my experience working in our school television 
studio and with a variety of green screen technology. I am grateful to them nudging 
me to create this book. Michael McCabe, my editor, has been incredibly patient and 
supportive of me as a new author. Thank you to the phenomenal educators who 
helped generate ideas for this book. Some of them didn’t make it into the book with 
specific projects, but their shared wisdom was essential. Thank you to each of them: 
Billy Spicer, April Wathen, Madonna Marks, Sarah Guillen, and Sherry Gick. Thank 
you to the administrators in my district who have encouraged and supported my work, 
specifically to principals Maureen Cheever, Daniel Ryan and Beth Carmody, tech 
director Maureen Miller, and Superintendent Dr. Trisha Kocanda. Most importantly, 
I want to thank my family for putting up with me spending countless hours away from 
them while writing this book.

Introduction
1
As educators, we are always looking for ways 
to inspire creativity and wonder in our students. 
Green screen technology allows us to help our 
students experience “magic.” Imagine being 
able to fly, shoot lasers from your fingertips, 
hold the Eiffel Tower in your hand, report from 
the International Space Station, or deliver the 
weather from inside a volcano. With green screen 
technology, your students can do all of these and 
much more (Figure 1-1).
It is no longer necessary to have a Hollywood 
budget or professional-grade lighting and 
camera equipment to achieve high-quality 
special effects. With some very basic materials

quality of presentations increases the likelihood 
that viewers will invest the time to absorb them 
(Figure 1-3).
This book is designed to empower both 
students and teachers. In it I’ll review how early 
filmmakers created mesmerizing special effects 
and show how these technologies evolved over 
the last century. I’ll examine and compare 
different methods and tools. Last, I will walk 
you through two dozen projects step by step. 
Hopefully, these projects will inspire dozens 
more. Once you teach your students these skills, 
watch out and be prepared to be amazed at what 
they create (Figure 1-4)!
This book is first and foremost for educators, 
not cinematographers. Professionals might 
cringe at the quality of some of the projects 
students create. The point, though, is that the 
technology has advanced to the point that a 
kindergartner can make a green screen video. 
While they might not win any Academy Awards, 
these projects will inspire learners of all ages and 
will lead them to create and produce projects 
that will open their worlds (Figure 1-5).
and a little technology, it is possible to create this 
type of magic (Figure 1-2).
Putting these tools in the hands of students 
allows them to extend their creativity and 
produce unbelievable presentations, projects, 
and videos. Where it would have cost millions of 
dollars and a small army of assistants, students 
are now only limited by their imaginations. 
Because more and more of our world is 
experienced in the “digital realm,” increasing the

Evolution of Green Screen

It’s important to remember that moving 
pictures, when they were first introduced, were 
in and of themselves quite magical. For the first 
time ever, audiences saw moving images on a 
screen. It was probably a lot like the experience 
many of us have when we experience virtual 
reality for the first time. What appeared to be 
lifelike movements of actors were in fact merely 
successive individual photographs taken and 
played back 24 frames per second. The images 
were created on light-sensitive silver-covered 
material exposed to very bright light and then 
“developed” in a chemical bath. Over a hundred 
years later this process that still evokes a sense 
of magic in those who experience it in the 
darkroom. Early films were short, black and 
white, and silent. They typically showed just one 
scene. It wasn’t until 1927 that sound would be 
able to be recorded and played in sequence with 
the film. 
Moving pictures were an immediate success, 
and audiences clamored for more. In 1898, 
Georges Méliès amazed viewers of his film The 
Four Heads (Figure 2-1). It is one of the earliest 
examples of special effects and must have 
absolutely mesmerized his audiences. Because 
the film was in black and white, he used glass 
plates painted black to “mask” certain parts of 
the scene, notably his head. In The Four Heads, 
Méliès filmed the scene with the glass plate over 
his head to give the illusion that he had taken 
his head “off.” He then rewound the film and 
re-exposed the film with his head on the table. 
He rewound and re-exposed the film several 
more times with his head in different places. The 
resulting double, triple, and quadruple exposures 
gave the illusion that his head had multiplied! It 
shocked and amused his audiences. What amazes 
me to this day is that he did all this “in camera,” 
not being sure that he had the “shot” until after 
he developed his film. He was a genius! (Figure 
2-2).

Award for special effects. By today’s standards, 
the effects seem pretty gimmicky, but they were 
mind-blowing at the time. The blue screen 
technique was used extensively in Hollywood 
but was incredibly meticulous. The technique 
had to be done frame by frame through several 
passes with myriad filters and development tools. 
Different techniques using various frequencies 
of light and filters continued to develop through 
this time as well.
Walt Disney developed a technique for color 
film that was seen in the classic film Mary 
Poppins from 1964 (Figure 2-5). It required 
filming the scene with very bright sodium light, 
which produced a distinctly orange cast on a 
white background. To make this technique work, 
it required an incredibly advanced printing 
As film technology evolved, so did special 
effects techniques. Soon a technique called a 
traveling matte allowed actors to move in front of 
objects that were not filmed in the original scene.
In 1918, Frank Williams patented his 
technique, which he later used in The Invisible 
Man (Figure 2-3). By dressing his actor in a 
head-to-toe black velvet suit against a black 
background, he was able to make it appear as 
if the actor was indeed invisible. Even today the 
effect is humorous and quite believable.
In 1925, a new technique was developed  
called blue screen or the Dunning process by  
C. Dodge Dunning. Dunning’s process worked 
by capitalizing on the qualities of light. The 
subject was lit with bright yellow light against a 
blue background. Through processing the film 
with a variety of dyes and filters, the different 
colors could be separated and printed onto film 
creating traveling mattes. One of the earliest 
examples of this technique is King Kong from 
1933 (Figure 2-4). 
The Thief of Baghdad, which was produced 
in 1940, is an excellent example of the blue 
screen technique. A genie is seen to escape from 
a bottle. This film went on to win the Academy

So, when and why did filmmakers start 
using green screens? The color green is used 
as a background when compositing scenes for 
two reasons. First, it is very different from the 
typical reddish color of human skin, and thus 
actors can be separated from the background 
more efficiently. If you look at a color wheel, 
red is on the opposite side of green. Second, 
film and digital camera sensors, like the human 
eye, are more sensitive to green light. As digital 
cameras have become more and more prevalent, 
so has the green screen technique. Filmmakers 
today still use both blue and green screens when 
compositing depending on the coloration of 
the scene, the character’s costume, and different 
lighting situations.

technique and a literal “one of a kind prism” 
that split the light.
With the development of microcomputers 
in the 1980s, the process could be automated 
and sped up exponentially. Richard Edlund 
won an Academy Award for the technology he 
developed that controlled the optical printer 
more efficiently in the making of one of my 
favorite films of all time, The Empire Strikes 
Back. The more I learn about how intensive the 
process of creating films such as The Empire 
Strikes Back, the more I am amazed that such 
films ever were created. Further advances 
in computer technology have allowed for 
precipitous growth in the variety and complexity 
of visual effects.

How exactly does the green screen, also 
known as the Chroma key, work? Essentially, 
the technique eliminates or isolates the narrow 
band of color contained in the green screen 
and replaces it with anything you can imagine 
(Figure 2-6). The screen does not have to be 
green; it can also be blue. Blue is also far from 
the color of human skin and is in some cases 
preferable to green. This is particularly true if 
the costume the actor is wearing contains green 
or the setting is at night. 
Today, green screen technology has advanced 
to the point that it does not require expensive 
lighting or special materials. In fact, you and 
your students can create projects with stunning 
results with just a few inexpensive tools.

Green screens can range in cost and complexity 
from a dollar to hundreds of thousands of 
dollars. Because this book is geared toward 
educators who are always on a tight budget, 
I will give a broad range of materials and 
installations for reference and let readers decide 
for themselves what is best for their applications 
and budgets. My best advice is to start small. 
Soon enough your students will be begging  
for more!
I mentioned earlier that the term green screen 
has become synonymous with the special effect 
of removing a background and replacing it with 
something else. The screen itself does not have 
to be green. It can also be blue; these two colors 
are not present in human skin tones. Digital 
cameras are highly sensitive to the wavelengths 
of these two colors, making them easier to 
remove. Green is a more luminescent color than 
blue, so it takes less light than a blue screen. For 
the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on green screen 
applications, but know that the color blue can be 
used as well (Figure 3-1).
A true green screen has a very specific color. 
Pantone, the world standard for color, specifies 
specific colors with its Pantone Matching System 
(PMS). According to Pantone, the pure green 
screen color is number 354C.
One of the most effective and professional 
ways of creating a green screen is to paint a 
smooth wall. There are a number of brands 
of Chroma key–specific paint. The industry 
standard is Rosco Chroma Key Paint. It is 
considerably more expensive than consumer-
grade latex paint, but the professionals stand by 
the results (Figure 3-2).

the name of the color is Sparkling Apple S-G-
430. The downside of a green wall is that it is 
not transportable. One fun advantage of green 
screen paint is that you can paint other items, 
such as tables, boxes, and so on. These can be 
helpful to support smaller items or even to place 
your subject.
I’ve seen some incredible installations that 
make use of what is called a cyclorama. These 
curved surfaces create the illusion of infinite 
space. A cyclorama is often called an infinity 
background or a cyc for short. Cycloramas range 
from tabletop applications to entire studio 
installations (Figures 3-3 and 3-4).
One of the most impressive transportable 
green screen setups I’ve come across is the 
ChromaWall Retractable Green Screen. This 
self-standing screen is 59 inches wide and 78.5 
inches tall (Figure 3-5). The manufacturer sells a 
smaller retractable version as well (Figure 3-6).
For less than half the price of this paint, 
you can get a gallon of flat latex paint from 
your do-it-yourself (DIY) store and achieve 
nearly identical results. The specific name or 
brand of the paint may vary, but one brand 
with which I have had excellent results is Behr

A much less costly setup is the 60- × 72-inch 
Reversible Chroma Blue and Green Background 
Kit. This kit comes with a stand, and the fabric 
background is collapsible for easy transport. 
This kit costs approximately $80 online. My 
school has two of these kits in our library, and

economical option is to purchase several yards 
of heavy cotton fabric at your hobby store and 
sew the panels together to achieve the width 
you need for your application. In my school 
television studio, we use a simple backdrop 
stand to support our green screen. We sewed 
horizontal “pockets” at the top and bottom of 
the cotton panels. Horizontal poles are inserted 
into these pockets, and the weight of the poles 
holds the fabric tight (Figure 3-8).
Green screens need not always be large 
enough to fit one or more standing figures. 
Many projects in this book are accomplished 
with much smaller scale green screens. Most are 
simple and easy to make. 
Just about any smooth, nonshiny surface 
can be used as a green screen. My top 10 green

There is only one of them. When trying 
to have student groups use them, there 
was always a line of kids waiting their 
turn.
These simple kits contain seven items (Figure 
3-16):
1.	
iPad mini 2. At $269, this is the tool. You 
can use other iPads, but this cost and size 
are best suited for students. What makes it 
perfect is that on just this one device you 
can shoot, edit, and share your green screen 
creations. As of now, there is no other 
android tablet and green screen program 
that can rival it.
2.	
Green Screen by Do Ink app. Several other 
apps are available, but this is the most user 
friendly and robust in the app store. Plus, 
the manufacturer is continually updating the 
program with new and improved features.
Do you have an interactive whiteboard in your 
classroom? Google Pantone 354C, and you can 
turn a whiteboard into a green screen! You can 
use your tablet as a smaller green screen, as I do 
in Project 7 (X-Ray Machine) by doing the same 
thing. Do you have an old projector screen? 
Use spray adhesive to mount some green cotton 
fabric or felt to it, and you have a retractable 
green screen.
Ryan O’Donnell has created kits that teachers 
can check out to do green screen projects in 
their rooms. Hardware aside, these kits can be 
made for a fraction of the cost of many found 
online. In his blog post about making these kits, 
O’Donnell reflected on the kit he had purchased 
from Amazon: 
1.	
I’ve never used the lights it came with . . . 
too bulky and just not really needed. The 
lighting in most classrooms is just fine.
2.	
It’s a bit large. Both lugging it around 
and setting up the stands is not super 
quick.

Jennifer Leban, an incredibly creative 
educator, came up with a “wearable green 
screen” with her students. This prototype uses 
recycled hangers, duct tape, and green foam 
core to create a green screen that is perfect for 
the webcam she uses with WeVideo. What I love 
most about the blog post where she details this 
creation is the way she is constantly thinking 
about improving the design. She freely admits 
that it isn’t perfect. She models the importance 
of the design cycle for her students (Figure 3-17 
through 3-19).
Wendy Garland, a librarian from 
Massachusetts, discovered that the green straws 
that Starbucks uses fit perfectly into the hole on 
a Shopkins toy. These make fun green screen 
“puppets” in front of a simple background 
(Figure 3-20).

4.	
Max Table Stand. You will need to keep 
the iPad as steady as possible to create a 
realistic illusion. You can try to use a tripod, 
but I find a stand such as this one from Max 
Cases to be small and easy to use. 
5.	
Green fabric. For each of my kits, I used 
2 yards of fabric. I folded one side over a 
few inches and sewed a seam. It is this seam 
through which you will feed the PVC pipe. 
6.	
PVC pipe and coupler. I went with a ¾-inch 
pipe, small but still strong enough to hold 
up the weight of the fabric. 
7.	
Green socks. Not needed but fun addition to 
put on hands to help make things “appear” 
from off screen.
O’Donnell suggests using couplers to make 
the overall length of the PVC tubes shorter so 
that they can fit inside a single travel bag. He 
also recommends that you make several so that 
groups of students can work at the same time.

Janelle Van Dop used green screen paint in 
a totally new way. She recorded her students 
painting a white background with Chroma key 
green paint to reveal an image that appeared to 
be underneath. This is such a simple but creative 
way to use the technology.
Dress your model in a Chroma green morph 
suit and have him or her move objects within 
the scene. Or have your model wear the suit 
except for his or her head, arm, leg, and so on. 
Try it with Chroma key green gloves or a mask. 
Anything green becomes invisible. 
Have an old treadmill? Paint it green, and you 
have a perfect tool for realistic movement. Rosco 
has a blog post that will walk you through the 
process step by step (www.rosco.com/spectrum/
index.php/2015/12/how-to-paint-a-greenscreen 
-treadmill/).
A solid support for the device capturing the 
photos or videos enhances the entire project and 
protects your tablet. There are dozens of tablet 
cases and stands available. Here are a couple of 
my favorites: 
Another way to help make objects move on a 
green background is to attach very light fishing 
line to your puppet or object. The line pretty 
much disappears when an image replaces the 
green screen.
No matter what you use to create your green 
screen, you’ll want to have some Chroma key 
fabric on hand. This is particularly useful to 
extend your green screen by covering the ground, 
a milk crate, a table, or whatever you want to use 
in your scene.
Green foam rubber tiles work well to expand a 
pop-up green screen background to the floor. An 
added benefit is that the foam rubber is soft and 
easy to clean.
Want an invisibility cloak? Drape that extra 
bit of green fabric over your actor, and you have 
one! Looking to capture some photos of your 
students performing gravity-defying skateboard 
tricks? Lay the green screen on the ground, and 
use a ladder to shoot from high above.

Green screen compositing would be pointless 
without some quality background content. It 
has never been easier to find and use appropriate 
content. One of the most effective ways of 
finding images is to use an image site such as

Of course, costumes and props are infinitely 
valuable for green screen projects. Visit your

keep them near my portable green screens for 
whenever inspiration strikes (Figure 3-23).

Green Screen Lighting
21
While this book isn’t geared toward 
cinematographers, it’s important to understand 
the science and technology behind green screen. 
Lighting is important. After all, the very concept 
of green screen replacement, or compositing, is 
based on the way light waves are absorbed by 
matter and how a camera sensor processes that 
information. 
The single biggest change I’ve noticed with 
green screens in the decade and a half that 
I’ve been using them is lighting. When I began 
using green screens, they required an immense 
amount of very bright white light. The halogen 
bulbs were extremely hot and costly to replace. 
This was not only uncomfortable in my tiny 
studio but also potentially dangerous. I had up 
to eight lights placed on stands throughout the 
studio. If a student touched one of those lamps, 
he or she could suffer a severe burn. I was also 
always concerned about the potential for fire. 
The Chroma key hardware and software needed 
this light in order to separate and remove the 
background. My setup looked much like the one 
in Figure 4-1.
Today, there are many more alternatives. Here 
are a few examples of permanent studio setups.
One school I visited in Colorado had an 
amazing setup. It included a cyclorama (or cyc) 
that gives the illusion of an infinite set (Figure 
4-2). This figure illustrates a few elements of 
a dream studio setup. First of all, the lights 
mounted on the ceiling eliminate the wear 
and tear (as well as the hassle) of placing light 
stands. The three lights closest to the backdrop 
provide smooth, even lighting of the green 
cyclorama. The two large lights off to the 
sides are called soft boxes. They produce an 
even “soft” light that illuminates the actors 
evenly. When taken together, these two different 
lighting planes produce no shadows on the

screen studio.

moment projects, we have multiple portable 
green screens that we can drag wherever they are 
needed (Figure 4-4).
In this figure you can see a portable green 
screen balanced against a wall. There is zero 
natural light in the hallway where this is being 
recorded, so we are using a battery-operated 
light-emitting diode (LED) light that screws 
on to our Padcaster frame. The Padcaster is a 
rugged frame for the iPad. The kit comes with 
this LED light, a microphone, and a sturdy 
tripod. When paired with the Green Screen by 
Do Ink app, it’s a mobile television production 
studio that rivals the $10,000 we began our 
television studio with back in 2001.
To get the highest-quality image, the 
background and the actors need to be lit evenly 
and effectively. Any wrinkles or “hot spots” in 
the background will cause problems when you 
background. This makes compositing complex 
backgrounds simple. Last, the green box can be 
used to simulate just about any type of element 
in postproduction. It could be a tree, a car, or 
a giant monster’s hand! It can also be used to 
allow the actors to “fly” by having them lie down 
on the box. 
When my school relocated its television studio 
to a place with a much smaller footprint, we 
decided to mount all our lights on the ceiling. 
You can also see that we mounted our cameras 
on arms that extend down from the ceiling as 
well (Figure 4-3).
By putting all of these fixtures on the ceiling, 
we got the feeling of more space, and we avoided 
tripping over cords and stands. This setup works 
perfectly for our daily news broadcast but isn’t 
ideal for spur-of-the-moment projects because 
of the fixed camera locations. For spur-of-the-

try to replace the green screen. For this reason, I 
love pop-up green screens. They can be propped 
up just about anywhere and are inherently 
wrinkle-free. It is also essential to avoid shadows. 
Simply having your subject stand away from the 
background and then slightly tweaking your 
foreground lighting can accomplish this. In 
Figure 4-4, the student recording the segment 
should have had the actor step forward a bit 
to get rid of the shadow. You can see from the 
preview on the iPad screen that the software is 
remarkably forgiving. 
To achieve professional results today, it is 
still advisable to have multiple lights, but LED 
or fluorescent bulbs now can power those light 
sources. The result is far cooler lights and less 
expensive replacements. These lights can also be 
placed on ceiling-mounted fixtures. If you have a

As soon as students discover how quickly and 
easily they can use Chroma key techniques, they 
begin pushing the concept. Just about anything 
green can become a green screen. I’ve loved 
doing stop-motion animation with my students. 
When one of them asked if we could use the 
green Lego base plates as a green screen, I had 
no idea. It turns out that you can! From then 
on, the stop-motion videos the students created 
reached an entirely new level of sophistication. 
They were now able to change angles and 
perspectives in ways we never had explored 
before. They began thinking critically about 
their sets and backgrounds. Even our Lego wall, 
which is made of blue base plates, has been used 
as a blue screen for puppet shows and stop-
motion films.
Having multiple mini–green screens has the 
added bonus of allowing many more students 
to create at the same time. Take the base plate 
example just mentioned. I use two of these 
base plates taped to a bookstand to create an 
individual green screen “set” for my students. 
Now I can have 10 to 12 pairs of students 
working at the same time. I’m blessed with 
huge windows in my space, so the students 
place their sets toward the windows. I’ve seen 
teachers who don’t have great lighting in their 
rooms use everything from clip-on LED lights to 
superpowerful flashlights diffused with a sheet 
of tissue paper.
dedicated space for your green screen studio, this 
is an excellent setup.
If you don’t have a permanent space for your 
green screen, you can still achieve high-quality 
results. Inexpensive lighting kits are readily 
available. They typically include two lights for 
the background and two for the subject. Very 
few teachers actually use them because they just 
take too long to set up and take up far too much 
space (Figure 4-5).
Many teachers place their green screens in 
a spot that receives even lighting, either from 
diffused window light or even from overhead 
lighting. My school just had all of our 
fluorescent ceiling lights replaced with LED 
fixtures. The quality of the light is much more 
pleasant and makes it easy to quickly capture 
green screen footage.

having to use multiple lights and

Production Software and Apps
25
Green screen production software varies 
widely in complexity and cost. There are 
programs designed solely to extract an object 
from its background and others that serve a wide 
range of purposes. For perspective, I’ll highlight 
the range but focus specifically on the tools that 
are most useful for educators.
Some instances call for the removal of a 
background in a still photograph. The world 
standard for photograph editing is Adobe 
Photoshop. This software is quite expensive, can 
take years to master, and is constantly evolving. 
One thing I have learned in studying Photoshop 
is that there are literally dozens of ways to do 
the same task. This is especially true for green 
screen photography, or compositing. There 
are powerful tools called plug-ins that can be 
purchased to speed up the process of photo and 
video editing. These plug-ins could be thought 
of as microprograms that focus on one specific 
function: removing a green background. For the 
average user, certainly for a student, they are 
quite costly. In contrast, the free iPad app called 
Magic Eraser allows users to do the same thing 
on tablets or phones in seconds. Not only is the 
powerful program free, but it also gives you the 
option of saving your composition as either a 
JPEG file on a white background or as a PNG 
file. A PNG file has a transparent background. 
This is particularly helpful when compositing 
because it allows you to layer the image easily. 
With a tool such as Magic Eraser, it is possible 
to remove the background of an image that was 
not recorded in front of a solid green or blue 
background. This doesn’t work for video, but for 
stills it is remarkable (Figure 5-1).
To edit and record green screen video, the 
first challenge is to define your platform: Mac, 
Windows, phone, tablet, or netbook. Each has a 
multitude of options available to it.
As schools move closer to one-to-one devices, 
the choice of device can have a significant 
impact on how these tools are used. Until 
recently, the choice of a laptop device came 
down to operating system: Windows versus 
Macintosh. Now a third choice has entered 
the market: netbooks powered by the Google 
Chrome operating system, commonly referred to 
as Chromebooks. The number of Chromebooks 
has grown exponentially primarily due to their 
low cost. As the number of these devices has 
ballooned, so has the number of applications 
that can be used with them. 
One of the most popular cross-platform pieces 
of software is WeVideo. WeVideo can be used on 
any computing device: Mac, PC, Chromebook, 
iOS, android, and even a web browser. This 
diverse program offers two modes: storyboard 
and timeline. This makes it easy for students 
as young as kindergarten age to build their 
projects and is expansive enough for budding 
cinematographers. The program includes a basic

power, and unlimited. The free version is limited 
in most ways and does not include green screen

Chroma key editor. Chromebook web cameras 
are less than magnificent, but they do allow 
you to capture images and low-quality video. I 
recommend recording video on another device 
and then uploading it to the web via Google 
Drive or a similar web storage facility. The video

decrease as their features and storage increase. 
It is possible now to purchase an Amazon Fire 
tablet for just over $50. As mentioned earlier, 
WeVideo is a universal tool and one of the best 
on android tablets. My preference for a tablet 
computer is the iPad. 
The iPad is also my favorite tool for digital 
creation. The inherent challenge of its tiny 
built-in storage is nixed with add-ons such as 
Google Drive, Google Photos, Dropbox, and 
more. There are two green screen iPad apps that 
are designed for elementary-age users but are 
powerful enough for advanced users as well: 
Veescope Live and Green Screen by Do Ink. 
Veescope Live packs some fantastic features, 
including up to 12-megapixel photographs and 
4-kilobyte-resolution videos. One of the features 
that stands out to me is the fact that you can use 
the Chroma key feature on a blue or green screen 
but also on any blank white wall. This means 
that you can “key out” simply without the need 
for a green screen; you just need a solid-color 
background. It also has some advanced features 
that let you fine-tune your lighting and create the 
highest-quality video and images. A final feature 
that sets it apart is the ability to add a variety of 
built-in layers such as a weather map and some 
basic virtual sets (Figure 5-3).
WeVideo allows users to sync their work across 
device and platform. Users can create a project 
at home on their phone and then complete 
it at school in their web browser simply by 
completing their work within their WeVideo 
account. WeVideo seamlessly integrates with 
Google apps, making collaboration and sharing 
simple. Another reason I especially like WeVideo 
is that it is a self-contained environment. 
Students can create green screen compositions 
and then layer in music, titles, special effects, 
and more all within the single WeVideo system. 
There is no need to export from one app and 
then import to another. For younger students, 
this simplifies the process significantly.
The simplest and most beautiful way for 
Apple users to create videos on their computers 
is iMovie. iMovie is included on every 
Macintosh as part of its operating system. This 
video editing and creation platform might lack 
a few of the advanced features available on 
professional editing programs such as Adobe 
Premiere and Final Cut Pro, but it is simple to 
use and exceedingly versatile. The green screen 
feature in iMovie is as easy as adding a layer and 
clicking on the green screen feature. I have used 
this program in my school news studio for years.
Tablet computers are now the most popular 
devices in schools. Their costs continue to

excellent features, one of which is green screen. 
The feature that gives TouchCast its name is 
the interactivity of the multitude of layers that 
can be added. They call it smart video, and 
viewers can interact with or “touch” each of 
the elements on-screen. This powerful program 
includes every feature you might find in a 
broadcast studio from an on-screen teleprompter 
to advanced lower thirds. Users can get started 
with the wide array of built-in templates. The 
powerful green screen editor includes dozens 
of backgrounds and virtual sets. This app is 
perfect for schools that want to produce a daily 
news-type program on a budget. Users can also 
customize and develop their own templates as 
they gain experience. Amazingly, this program 
is free! It is robust enough to be used by leading 
companies around the world and will have your 
students creating engaging videos in minutes 
(Figure 5-5).
TouchCast shares its mission:
We have a mission—to support education 
reform in public schools by giving students 
deeper learning experiences. We are all 
aware of the many challenges that the public 
education system is facing. At TouchCast, we 
have the opportunity to impact millions of 
The app I typically recommend for educators 
and students who are just getting started with 
Chroma keying on iPads is the Green Screen by 
Do Ink app (Figure 5-4). The simple interface is 
easy for users of all ages to master. The feature 
that makes Do Ink stand out even further is its 
ability to combine up to three layers in a single 
video or photographic file. At first, this may 
not seem to be that big of a deal, but when you 
combine graphics or animations created in other 
apps such as Animate by Do Ink, you can expand 
the creative potential exponentially. Saving 
layered compositions and then reimporting them 
and adding further layers can expand this process 
infinitely. Most of the projects in this book were 
created with the Green Screen by Do Ink app, 
but with a little creativity, they could be done 
with other apps or tools as well.
Neither of these apps is designed for final 
video production. They are terrific at creating 
green screen effects, but tools such as iMovie 
for iOS and WeVideo can be used to combine 
multiple video segments and add sound effects, 
transitions, recorded audio, or a soundtrack.
TouchCast is a massively powerful iOS app 
designed to have students broadcasting in 
minutes. This fantastic tool is chock-full of

This is an amazing time to be an educator! A 
nearly unlimited number of pathways exist for 
teachers and students to bring their imaginations 
to life. I hope that that this book serves as a 
springboard for those ideas and encourages 
creators to experiment and explore.

Projects Step by Step

Most of the projects in this book were created 
using the iPad. This is true for two reasons. 
First, I believe the iPad to be the easiest and 
most flexible tool for students to use to create 
media. Second, it also happens to be the device 
that my school district provides to my students. 
I chose to demonstrate many of these projects 
using the green Screen by Do Ink app because it 
is one of the most intuitive and student-friendly 
apps I have come across for creating green screen 
content. That being said, with a little effort, each 
of these projects could be completed with similar 
apps or tools. Greg Kulowiec coined the phrase 
app smashing some time ago. He writes about  
the concept on his blog (http://kulowiectech 
.blogspot.com/) There he describes app smashing 
as “the process of using multiple apps to create 
projects or complete tasks.” You will see that 
each of these projects leverages this idea. Dig in 
and have some fun with these projects. Use them 
as a starting point with your students. Remix 
them and then, most important, share them with 
the world. By doing so, you encourage us all to 
grow and learn together. I hope that you and 
your students will have as much fun with these 
projects as my students and I did!

Instructions for Students
1.	 Complete the Superhero Planning Sheet 
(Figure 6-1).
2.	 Have a partner photograph you in your best 
superhero pose in front of the green screen. 
If you want to “fly,” you will need to cover 
a sturdy table or box with green fabric to 
“erase” the support. You could also paint 
the box the same color as your green screen 
(Figure 6-2).
1. Superhero Project
In this project, students will explore the 
characteristics of what makes a hero. Each 
student will develop his or her own superhero 
persona and will put the resulting character in 
front of a heroic background image. Finally, 
each student will create a “museum tag” that will 
accompany his or her portrait when printed.
Setup
This project is the culmination of a larger study 
on what it means to be a hero. Students read a 
variety of picture books, including Dex: The 
Heart of a Hero, written by Caralyn Buehner 
and illustrated by Mark Buehner; Superhero 
ABC, written and illustrated by Rob McLeod; 
Ten Rules of Being a Superhero, written by Deb 
Pilutti; and The Superhero Instruction Manual, 
written by Kristy Dempsey and illustrated 
by Mark Fearing. After reading these or 
similar books, students generate a list of the 
characteristics of heroes as well as the causes 
superheroes tend to strive to protect. Students 
complete a Superhero Planning Sheet to prepare 
for their portrait and animation project.

4.	 Use the two-finger pinch and zoom 
maneuver to position the background where 
you would like it (Figure 6-4).
5.	 Import the photograph of you against the 
green screen into the green Screen by Do 
Ink app (Figure 6-5).
6.	 Use the two-finger pinch and zoom 
maneuver to reposition the image the way 
you would like it.
7.	 Tap on the green screen layer.
Tip: When using poster board as a green screen, it is 
important to make sure that there are no “hot spots,” or 
areas that are so bright that the green is not visible. This 
will make it very difficult to remove the background in 
the green screen software. One way to get around this 
is to crop the image before importing it into the green 
Screen by Do Ink app. You can also crop the image within 
the green screen program, but I usually prefer to do it 
before importing.
3.	 Import the color background you’ve chosen 
for your superhero into the green Screen 
by Do Ink app, making it the bottom layer

piece of construction paper in a visually 
interesting style.
3.	 Use the iPad stand and iPad to photograph 
your collection from above, making sure to 
capture all the construction paper and your 
nametag in the upper-right-hand corner 
(Figure 6-8).
4.	 Have a partner photograph you in a fun pose 
in front of the green screen (Figure 6-9).
2. I Spy Book
In this project, students will create their very 
own I Spy book page and hide themselves in 
it. A “buddy class” will collaborate with the 
students by writing the riddle clues for the 
reader/viewer. The finished project will be shared 
as a “buddy project,” and older and younger 
buddies will read and explore it together.
Setup
This project is a great way to help students 
develop literacy and visual acuity. Students 
will read a wide variety of I Spy–type books. 
My three favorites are I Spy: A Book of Picture 
Riddles, I Spy Extreme Challenger: A Book of 
Picture Riddles, and I Spy School Days: A Book 
of Picture Riddles by authors Jean Marzollo et 
al. and illustrator Walter Wick. Then students 
will create several lists of what makes for a 
fun picture riddle photograph, what makes a 
good riddle clue, and what objects they want to 
include in their pictures.

Writing the picture riddles is the most 
challenging aspect of this project. The 100 
objects could be part of the one-hundredth day 
of school celebration. Another way to make the 
riddle writing more manageable would be to 
have the same 100 objects for all students and 
then have the class generate rhyming words for 
all the objects. 
10.	 Then save the image to your camera roll.
11.	 After printing your picture on legal-
sized paper, glue it to the 12- × 18-inch 
construction paper.
12.	 After the buddy classes have written, 
typed, and printed their clues, assemble the 
photographs and riddles together into a 
class book.

1.	 Study the magazine covers and begin to 
analyze them for details:
a.	
What do you notice about the 
photographs?
b.	
What do you notice about the magazine 
titles?
c.	
What are the common elements on the 
magazine covers?
2.	 After making a list of the characteristics 
and common elements, imagine that you 
could be on the cover of any magazine. 
Which magazine would it be?
3.	 Complete the Magazine Cover Planning 
Sheet (Figure 6-30).
4. You’re on the Cover  
of a Magazine!
Being on the cover of a magazine is something 
that very few of us have the chance to 
experience. In this project, students not only 
will appear on the cover of a magazine, but 
they will also develop all the details about their 
magazine, including headlines, pricing, and other 
thoughtful features. As is the case with many 
projects, there are a number of ways to do this 
activity. These include complex programs such 
as Photoshop and versions of templates made 
in word-processing and/or presentation software 
such as Keynote. For the sake of ease, I’ve 
chosen to use Big Huge Labs’ Magazine Cover 
template (https://bighugelabs.com/magazine.php). 
While there are a multitude of options, this is 
one of the simplest ways to do this project.
Setup
There are magazines that cater to just about any 
interest group, hobby, or activity. Depending 
on the age group of your students, you might 
want to presearch magazine covers to screen 
out inappropriate content. You might copy 
some that cater to popular topics or hobbies of 
your students such as Hockey, Equestrian, Boy’s 
Life, Girl’s Life, National Geographic, Sports 
Illustrated, TIME, or People.

props to help you “sell” your cover photo. 
For example, if you want to be on Runner 
Magazine, you might want to wear your 
running shoes and gear (Figure 6-31).

enhance your cover photo. It can be a 
simple colored background or a photo of 
where you might want to “put” yourself for 
your cover photo (Figure 6-32).

5. Eye to Eye with the BFG,  
or the “Big Friendly Giant”
In this project, students will put themselves in 
the hand of the beloved giant from Roald Dahl’s  
The BFG.
Setup
The BFG by Roald Dahl is one of the most 
popular books I’ve ever shared with students. 
The film adaptation has caused even more 
students to fall in love with Roald Dahl. After 
reading the book, students will all want to stand 
in the giant’s hand and look him in the eye.

Students could use video instead of stills. 
Students could act out their favorite lines 
between the child and the BFG. Students could 
also “be” the giant by combining two video 
layers in the Green Screen by Do Ink app. Just 
use the same two-finger pinch and zoom to 
make the child seem small in the hands of the 
BFG. This is a fun technique for just about any 
“monster” or giant. Once students master it, 
they will want to try all sorts of permutations.

6. Snow Globe Poetry Project
This project comes from educator Jessica 
Goodrow from Conroe, TX. In it, students will 
use the green screen to transport themselves 
inside a snow globe. They will create their 
own wintry snow globe and a wintry poem to 
accompany their image.
Setup
Wintry snow globes can transport us instantly 
to a magical snowy day with just a shake. 
Students will love dressing up in their winter 
gear and “trapping” themselves inside a snow 
globe. They’ll also write a poem about winter to 
accompany their photograph.

Instructions for Students
1.	 Identify which part of your body you would 
like to “x-ray.”
2.	 Have a partner photograph you with the 
framed Chroma key green foam sheet over 
the part of your body you are going to

8. Monument Project 
In this project, students will put their faces on 
famous world monuments. This would be a 
terrific way to deliver oral reports that is also fun 
(Figure 6-63).
Setup
After studying several human-made monuments 
such as the Sphinx, Crazy Horse, Mount 
Rushmore, the Lincoln Memorial, etc., students 
will put their faces onto monuments of their 
choice. Students will present their research via 
video “from” the monument.

up a new window with five tools. Select the 
eraser tool, and adjust the opacity of the 
image (Figure 6-65).
8.	 Use the eraser tool to remove the “face” on 
the monument. You may need to adjust the 
opacity to make the illusion appear more 
realistic.
9.	 Import the video/photo that you want to 
put on the monument, making it the bottom 
layer (Figure 6-66).
Instructions for Students
1.	 Choose your monument, and do your 
research.
2.	 Find an image of your monument.
3.	 Study the orientation of the photograph 
to plan how you need to position yourself 
while recording your oral presentation.
4.	 Record your oral presentation, being very 
careful not to move your head.
5.	 Import the image into Green Screen by 
Do Ink app, and rather than making it 
the bottom layer, make it the middle layer 
(Figure 6-64).
6.	 Tap on the middle layer to make it active.

Setup
This project was part of the culmination of 
an interdisciplinary exploration of American 
immigration. Students participated in a day-
long simulation in which they experienced many 
of the same challenges immigrants faced when 
they came through Ellis Island. They came 
dressed in simple clothing, and each “family” 
created a basic suitcase in which they had to 
place very few precious belongings. This project 
helped cement the experiences the students had 
and served as an excellent way for students to 
consolidate their learning.

10. Word Cloud Project
In this project, students create a “word cloud” 
and then put themselves in front of it as a gift 
for a loved one (Figure 6-78).
Setup
This project is a fun way to personalize a unique 
gift for loved ones. The Word Cloud app uses 
the frequency of words to determine their size. 
Students can use words they want to appear 
larger multiple times to enhance this effect. The 
final result is a personalized word cloud.

Setup
Students will choose a famous historical event 
and create an animated version of the front 
page of the newspaper from the day the event 
occurred. This project uses one of the powerful 
editing features of the Green Screen by Do 
Ink app, the masking tool. Once students see 
how easily they can mask out certain areas of a

Instructions for Students
1.	 Brainstorm! After viewing other PSAs, it’s 
time to make your own! Typically, groups 
of three to four students must brainstorm 
the problem they want their PSA to address. 
Questions you might ask yourselves include
a.	 What is the problem?
b.	 Why is it a problem?
c.	 How does it affect individuals and others?
d.	 What sources might we use to research 
this further?
e.	 What are potential solutions?
2.	 Then you should select at least one ad 
technique and at least two effects for your 
PSA. For example:
Ad Technique  
(must pick at least one)
Effects You Could Use 
(must pick at least two)
Appeal by association
Humor
Fear
Loaded language

12. TouchCast PSA Project 
This project comes to us from Laura Gardner, 
teacher/librarian at Dartmouth Middle School 
in Dartmouth, MA, and TouchCast STAR 
Ambassador. In this project, students will 
create a 30-second to 1-minute public service 
announcement (PSA) using TouchCast. For 
example, students could create PSAs about 
social issues or digital citizenship topics for 
their peers, parents, and community. Creating 
a PSA requires research, collaboration, and 
speaking skills. TouchCast is an excellent tool 
for this project; the tool includes a teleprompter, 
a whiteboard, a green screen option, and virtual 
applications (vApps) that can make your video 
interactive and engaging. In addition, TouchCast 
is free for educators and can be exported to 
YouTube, the camera roll, and social media, as 
well as your own TouchCast channel. This app 
is also a great option to use for a morning news 
show, flipping the classroom, and any other 
curricular project. 
Setup
Much of the work for this project is done before 
filming. Before starting the project, introduce 
the idea of PSAs by watching ads from the Ad 
Council (www.adcouncil.org/Our-Campaigns) 
and analyzing them (https://goo.gl/fbVCvh).

5.	 Then open TouchCast, and click on Camera 
at the bottom and then Teleprompter to 
paste the script in (Figure 6-98).
6.	 Click on the blue Edit button in the 
teleprompter, press down in the white box, 
and select Paste (Figure 6-99).
7.	 Once the script is in the teleprompter, you 
can click on the “T” in the teleprompter 
to change the size and color of the 
teleprompter text. The teleprompter will 
scroll automatically when recording. If it 
scrolls too fast or too slow, just adjust the 
scrubber on the far left of the screen next to 
the word “Teleprompter.”
Storyboard! Now it’s time to use a 
storyboard to flesh out your ideas. 
Scholastic has a great storyboard for 
PSAs (www.scholastic.com/drive2life/pdf/
NRSF_612_Graphic%20Organizer.pdf). 
Think outside the box. Do you want your 
PSA to be fully acted out, or will portions 
include images or words on the screen with 
a voice-over? 
3.	 Script and choose images. If you will be 
speaking a lot in your PSA, then you should 
write a script in Google Docs. In addition, 
you will need to find images for your 
background and any vApp images you want 
to pop up on the screen. Use copyright-
free images for your background. Choose 
“images labeled for reuse” in Google (on 
a computer, click Tools and then Usage 
Rights; these options are not available 
on an iPad), or better yet, use a database 
such as Britannica ImageQuest, which has 
thousands of images that have been cleared 
of copyright. You should put citations and 
links to images in the Google doc.
4.	 Set up TouchCast. When you are finished 
with your script, it is time to set up 
TouchCast. Open Docs on your iPad, and 
click Select All. Copy the entire script 
(Figure 6-97).

11.	 On the next screen, click on the word 
“Albums” to find the pictures from the 
camera roll (TC backgrounds are also 
available) (Figure 6-102).
12.	 Once you click on the image from the 
camera roll and hold your iPad up to a 
green screen, your background will appear 
(Figure 6-103).
8.	 Now it’s time to set up the green screen. 
Open your Google doc again on the iPad, 
click the link for each background image, 
and save those images to the camera roll.
9.	 In the TouchCast app, click Effects at the 
bottom and then Green Screen (Figure

side of the screen (iPad 4 and iPad Air 
models currently allow video backgrounds 
as well) (Figure 6-101).

process (Figure 6-105). (Note the camera 
option with full screen in Figure 6-106.)
15.	 Film your PSA! You should first review 
the PVLEGS rubric to make sure that you 
understand the expectations for speaking 
skills during this project (http://pvlegs.com/
effectiverubrics/pvlegsrubric/). You should 
also make sure that you are effectively using 
at least one ad technique and some special 
effects.
16.	 You do not need long in front of a green 
screen for this project provided that you 
have set everything up in advance and have 
practiced. Editing options are good enough 
that you should film straight through, 
repeating sections where you make mistakes.
13.	 If you have vApp, you might want text to 
appear in your video, so you should set 
those up as well. For example, in some 
digital citizenship PSAs, students have 
included screenshots of text messages going 
back and forth to show cyber bullying. 
To do this, students screenshot their text 
messages, added the images to Google Drive 
on their phones, and then opened those 
images in TouchCast as vApp photographs. 
You can also use vApps such as polls, 
YouTube videos, questions, a web page, and 
much more (Figure 6-104).
14.	 You can add vApps when recording as a 
small pop-up, full screen, or full screen with 
a small window for your camera. For older 
iPads, vApps must be added while filming, 
but for iPad 4 and iPad Air, vApps can be 
burned into the video during the editing

20.	 To view your clips, press down in the top-
right corner. I do not recommend that you 
watch your clips until the editing process, 
however. If you wish to include vApps as 
you film, you should click on vApps at the 
bottom before pressing the Record button, 
and you should click on those vApps one by 
one at whatever point in filming you want 
them to show up. Be sure to choose their 
orientation before filming (Figure 6-108).
21.	 If you click Done and want to film more, 
you can click on Add Clip in the bottom-
left corner and then Record in Studio with 
Camera (Figure 6-109).
17.	 You should film “selfie style” so that you 
can see how you look on camera and make 
sure that you are referencing your green 
screen background correctly. Click Camera 
and then Swap on the far right to swap the 
camera if needed. Position the iPad on the 
tripod/iPad stand so that it is stable.
18.	 To film press the red Record button. To 
pause, press it again.
19.	 You can also use the whiteboard to 
film. You can set up the whiteboard or 
chalkboard and then type or write on the 
screen. You need to record the whiteboard 
for as long as you wish the words to be on 
the screen. If you want the words to be 
accompanied by silence, be sure to click 
Camera and turn off the microphone. 
(Make sure that students use this feature 
to cite their image sources and any other 
sources as a final slide) (Figure 6-107).

25.	 Be sure to set vApps up and then hit Record 
on the clip, watch your already-recorded 
scene, and add the vApps one by one in the 
correct spots.
26.	 Export! Once your clip is finished, it’s time 
to export your TouchCast. Click Export 
TouchCast on the editing screen. If you 
wish to only save the TouchCast to the 
camera roll, which is a great option for 
younger students, do not sign in and just 
click Save to Camera Roll. Otherwise, sign 
in and choose the options that work best for 
you (Figure 6-112).
27.	 Reflect and assess. You should reflect on 
this assignment. What worked well? What 
was difficult? What would you do differently 
next time?
28.	 Teachers can assess for content using a 
teacher-created rubric, as well as speaking 
skills using the PVLEGS rubric.
22.	 Editing! Once all the clips are filmed, it’s 
time to edit. Click Done in top-right corner, 
and watch each clip with an eye to trim. 
Click on the clip, and then click Trim at the 
bottom.
23.	 You can use the scissors to cut a clip into 
pieces, and then you can drag the blue ends 
of each clip to trim off sections (Figure 
6-110).
24.	 This is the point at which those of you with 
newer iPads can add vApps to your clips as 
well. To do this, simply click on the clip you 
wish to add a vApp to, and click Add vApps 
at the bottom of the screen (Figure 6-111).

Instructions for Students
1.	 Use the storyboard sheet to roughly plan 
out the action, setting, and perspective of 
each scene (Figure 6-113).
13. Stop-Motion Animation 
Project on Lego Green 
Screen
In this project, students will create a stop-motion 
film and backdrop layer that augments the project.
Setup
Stop-motion animation is a fascinating pursuit. 
Show students some examples of stop-motion 
animation such as Wallace and Gromit or the 
myriad of Lego stop-motion videos, and they 
will be incredibly excited to make their own. A 
YouTube video provides a terrific explanation 
(www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVjMFU11hVA). 
In films, there are typically 24 frames per second. 
Students very quickly realize the importance of 
tiny movements and many exposures to create 
smooth, “realistic” animation.

2.	 Select images for each scene. It is important 
that you do this to make sure that the 
animation lines up with any details in your 
scene.
3.	 Set up the background. I used bookends 
and tape to anchor both the green and gray 
base plates (Figure 6-114).
4.	 Set up the camera on the tripod stand. It 
is essential that the iPad remain as still as 
possible to get the best results. 
Tip: Use tape to mark the edges of what is visible 
from the iPad (Figure 6-115).
5.	 Photograph the animated object, and then 
make tiny adjustments and photograph 
again. This is repeated over and over to 
achieve the illusion that the animated object 
is moving on its own (Figure 6-116).
6.	 Play back the frames to see if the object is 
moving as you would like it to move.

9.	 To record sound effects or dialogue, tap the 
Record button (Figure 6-119).
10.	 Place the play head at the spot where you 
wish to add audio, and click Record. If you 
would like to import audio, you have several 
options (Figure 6-120).
7.	 You can adjust the number of frames per 
second by clicking on the Gear icon in 
iStopMotion. Adjusting the number of 
frames slows down the animation. You can 
also select Play at Half Speed to slow down 
the animation to make the movement more 
fluid. (Figure 6-117).
8.	 It is best to add sound effects before 
exporting the film to the camera roll. To 
access the audio features in iStopMotion, 
tap on the music note at the bottom-left 
corner of the screen (Figure 6-118).

13.	 Import the video you created with the Boinx 
iStopMotion into the green screen, making 
it the top layer; pinch and zoom to size.
14.	 Use the color wheel to adjust the Chroma 
key color to match the green of your 
background; adjust the sensitivity to dial in 
the image to your liking.
15.	 When you are satisfied with the timing, slide 
the Image/Video slider to Video, and Save to 
save it to the camera roll. 
Tip: Because this video has multiple scenes, tap 
the background layer and grab the red “handle” 
to adjust the length that the background image 
is displayed. For each new scene, import a new 
background image and adjust its length to fit the 
timing you would like (Figure 6-123).
16.	 When you are happy with the timing for 
each of the scenes, slide the Video/Image tab 
to Video, and export the film to camera roll. 
Extensions
Students could create and record the 
soundtracks/sound effects for their films. Groups 
could collaborate to produce a film made up of 
a variety of scenes/settings as part of a larger 
project. Students could combine stop-motion 
with hand-drawn animation with an app such as 
Do Ink Animation.
11.	 When you are satisfied with both your 
animation and your sound effects, save 
the film as a movie file to the camera roll 
(Figure 6-121).
12.	 Open Green Screen by Do Ink app and 
import the photograph for the first scene 
in your film, making it the bottom layer 
(Figure 6-122).

3.	 Next, photograph yourself and other 
characters in front of the green screen.
4.	 Search for background images that help you 
to communicate your story. 
5.	 Import each background into the green 
screen, placing the background image as the 
bottom layer (Figure 6-125).
14. Create Your Own Comic
In this project, students will plan and create their 
own comic book or graphic novel. 
Setup
For this project, we’ll use some paper and pencil 
planning tools and will then use technology to 
help us make the vision a reality.

Instructions for Students
1.	 Complete the plot diagram via 
ReadWriteThink (www.readwritethink.org/
files/resources/interactives/plot-diagram/) 
to develop a sense of story sequencing and 
plot elements (Figure 6-124).
2.	 After you have developed your plan, use 
one of the comic layouts to choose the 
photographs you want to use to tell your 
story by sketching the perspective and text 
of each “cell.”

11.	 I began removing the background by 
selecting the Magic Wand tool and then 
tapping on the green background color 
(Figure 6-130).
12.	 The Magic Wand tool does a very good job, 
but I needed to use the eraser to remove 
smaller sections. The app allows you to use 
the two-finger pinch to zoom into these tiny 
areas (Figure 6-131).
6.	 Insert the green screen image as the top 
layer (Figure 6-126).
7.	 Adjust the Chroma key wheel to the 
appropriate shade of green (Figure 6-127).
8.	 Slide the Video/Image switch to Image, and 
save the image to the camera roll.
9.	 I decided I wanted to have multiple versions 
of one of the images. In order to do this, 
I used the Magic Eraser app to extract the 
background (Figure 6-128).
10.	 After opening the app, you can either take 
a photo or select a photo from your camera 
roll; I chose the image I wanted to duplicate 
(Figure 6-129).

13.	 If you erase too much, you can simply click 
on the Restore pen, and when you draw over 
the area that was inadvertently erased, it will 
reappear (Figure 6-132).
14.	 You can tap the inverse to see exactly what 
you have selected and decide whether you 
need to do some more cleaning up before 
saving.

15.	 When you are happy with your selection, 
save it (Figure 6-133).
16.	 You will be asked whether you would like 
to save the selection as a JPG file with a 
white background or a PNG file with a 
transparent background. By selecting a 
transparent background, you can layer 
many versions of the same image.
17.	 I decided that I wanted to create an image 
that looked like a large group of clones 
was standing in a dark forest. To do this, I 
used Do Ink’s ability to create three distinct 
layers.
18.	 I imported the background image.
19.	 Next, I imported the PNG file I had just 
created in the Magic Eraser app (Figure 
6-134).
20.	 I imported a second version of the PNG 
file and used the two-finger pinch to make 
it smaller. I next saved these three layers as 
a still frame and then reimported it into Do 
Ink, making it the bottom layer again.

23.	 When you have created all your images, 
open Book Creator (Figure 6-137).
24.	 Select New Book from the top-left corner.
25.	 Choose a book shape. I chose Landscape 
(Figure 6-138).
26.	 Create your cover by importing photographs 
and adding text; you can also add color to 
the full page (Figure 6-139).
21.	 Then I simply continued doing this process 
until I was satisfied with the number of 
duplicates I had created (Figure 6-135).
22.	 I decided to add a filter in the Photos app 
to make the figures look more like the dark 
background (Figure 6-136).

your pages before exporting to the camera 
roll (Figure 6-142).
27.	 Select the layout of your comic book panels 
(Figure 6-140).

32.	 When you are pleased with your book, tap 
the Share icon. You will have four ways to 
export your book (Figure 6-145).
Extensions
This example uses only still images, but with 
the Book Creator app, it is possible to integrate 
video segments into the comic cells as well. 
30.	 You can click Read to Me, and an 
automated voice will read all the words in 
your book to you; it’s a bit robotic, but it 
is still neat to hear your words read aloud 
(Figure 6-143).
31.	 By clicking on the Adjustment tab, you can 
determine how the book appears to your 
readers and tweak a few additional elements 
(Figure 6-144).

architectural example, making it the bottom 
layer in the Green Screen by Do Ink app.
4.	 Place a wooden geometric solid in front of 
the green screen (in this case, the students 
used plastic library totes for a green screen!) 
(Figure 6-147).
15. Find Geometric Shapes  
in Architecture
This project comes to us from third grade 
teacher Patrick Johnson from Maple Grove 
Public School in Ontario, Canada. He used it as 
a way to have his students use their “math eyes 
to find 3D shapes in architecture.” 
Setup
Students use wooden models of basic geometric 
solids and images of famous architectural 
landmarks to find examples.

collaboration with classes in other provinces, 
states, and countries around the world. This 
project is like a twenty-first-century version of 
the famous Jeff Brown book, Flat Stanley. This 
book, published in 1964, has helped students to 
connect with others all over the world (Figures 
6-150 and 6-151).
16. Pic Forward Global Green

Pic Forward is a global green screen challenge 
for students, teachers, and schools. The idea 
is to have people all around the world edit 
their monthly green screen photographs and 
then to “Pic Forward” or “pass them on” via 
social media to other classes so that they can 
participate too. Fourth and fifth grade students 
lead this project to spread creativity around the 
globe.

green screen in a variety of fun poses 
(Figure 6-160).
17. Storytelling Project 
This project comes from first grade teacher 
Chloe Milligan of the Adams Elementary 
School in the Santa Barbara Unified Schools 
District. In this project, Chloe had staff 
members take a variety of action shots in front 
of a green screen with all sorts of costumes 
and props. Students then took those images, 
processed them in green screen editing software 
to change the backgrounds, and then wrote 
creative pieces with their teachers as the 
characters. 
Setup
Chloe used this project to help her students learn 
the ins and outs of the software before getting 
in front of the camera. By demonstrating how 
easily the process of removing the green screen 
was and having her students explore the process 
of locating and then using unique backgrounds, 
she was preparing them for using the green 
screen software in more advanced ways.

Karen Hopis is a library media specialist from 
Erie, CO. She had a conversation with her 
content educators about how to enhance the 
culture of reading within their school. They 
asked the question: “How do we help students 
see their teachers as readers?” Her solution was 
to use a green screen and Quick Response (QR) 
codes to literally show the teachers in the school 
reading and making book recommendations to 
their students (Figure 6-164).

president’s responses as well. While it might 
not be possible to know exactly his response, 
the responses should be based on facts and 
events that had a major impact on his life.
3.	 When you have your questions and answers 
written out and have practiced them several 
times, open the Puppet Pals 2 app (Figure 
6-174).
19. Interview with a President
In this project, students will imagine what it 
would be like to interview a president, and then 
they actually will conduct an interview with a 
president from the past.
Setup
Imagine if you could ask any president in the 
history of the United States five questions. What 
would they be? How do you think he would 
answer? In this project, students get to do just 
that.

8.	 Next, tap the Character icon to select your 
actor. In the free version of the app, you are 
limited to a few characters. For this project, 
we are going to use President Abraham 
Lincoln. Tap him to select (Figure 6-179).
9.	 For this project, the president is going to 
stand on your shoulder, so he will not be 
moving around. If you tap and hold him, 
you can change the direction in which he 
is looking. You can also adjust his arms 
and legs by pressing and moving them. 
When you are ready, tap the Record button 
(Figure 6-180).

13.	 Now you are ready to import your video 
into the green screen app. 
14.	 Create a new project.
15.	 Select a solid-color image as the 
background, making it the bottom layer 
(Figure 6-183).
16.	 Next, import the recording of the president, 
making it the top layer.
17.	 For the middle layer, select the Camera icon, 
and select the rear-facing camera so that 
you can see where the president will appear 
in the frame.
18.	 Use the two-finger pinch and zoom 
maneuver to adjust the size and location of 
the president.
19.	 When you have him in just the right place, 
begin recording. You will see his mouth 
moving when he is “talking.” Try to turn 
your head toward the president when you 
are “listening.” 
20.	 Your partner will need to read the answers 
in the voice of the president while you are 
listening.
10.	 When you want the president’s mouth 
to move, you need to press and hold his 
character as he “speaks.” Don’t worry, you 
won’t actually be using the audio track; you 
are just having him move his mouth. You’ll 
record him speaking later in the project.
11.	 When you are done, press the Stop button. 
You will then be asked to name the 
recording (Figure 6-181).
12.	 After saving, you will export the recording 
to the camera roll; I saved the high-quality 
version (Figure 6-182).

In this project, students will create their own 
newscast, complete with reports on weather, 
sports, and more. The segments will be filmed in 
front of a green screen so that the background 
can be enhanced in the Green Screen by Do Ink 
app afterward.
Setup
Students love creating and sharing their 
own news broadcasts. TeleStory makes this 
fun. Students should storyboard each of the 
segments of the broadcast, including cue cards. 
20. TeleStory
TeleStory is a video creation app that allows 
kids to write, direct, and star in their own 
television shows. The app has facial recognition 
and sticker-like costumes that enhance each of 
the broadcast types. Students can choose from 
“The News,” “The Band,” “Eye Spy,” and “Star 
Adventure” (Figure 6-186). They can then create 
whole TV shows by choosing segments around 
a common theme. Each segment includes some 
fun features such as cue cards, multiple cameras, 
and special video and sound effects. Students 
can then save their broadcasts to their camera 
rolls and even to the web in a parent-monitored 
and -approved channel.

segments, add your text to the cue cards; 
you are limited to one card per segment 
(Figure 6-188).
3.	 When you are ready, tap the Start button 
to begin recording. Each segment has two 
“cameras” that give a different perspective. 
There are also two sound or action effects 
that correspond to the theme as well. You 
can tap these while recording your segments 
to enhance the overall impact (Figure 
6-189).

you will be asked to add the details of the 
broadcast to the “clapper” (Figure 6-193).
8.	 Save the broadcast to the camera roll.
9.	 Next, open the Green Screen by Do Ink app 
to create a new project.
10.	 Choose a background image with which 
you would like to replace the green screen 
image for each of the segments. Load that 
image, making it the bottom layer. I loaded 
a solid black image to the timeline so that 
the opening credits were not affected by the 
green screen. Click on the middle layer, and 
drag the red “handle” to adjust the length 
of each of the background images to match 
the effect you are trying to create (Figure 
6-194).
5.	 Now you may preview the video, rerecord it, 
or save it (Figure 6-191).
6.	 Place this segment in the timeline for the 
complete broadcast. Then you can tap the 
Plus button to add another segment or the 
Check button to go ahead and produce the 
entire broadcast (Figure 6-192).

Obviously, this is just one of the four built-in 
templates from which students can choose. 
Each one offers a multitude of options and 
features that are sure to encourage creativity 
and collaboration. Each template also includes 
an “empty shot” that allows students to choose 
from all the costumes, further enhancing the 
creative potential.

Instructions for Students
1.	 Assist your teacher in creating a bird’s-
eye map of your learning space using the 
Google Drawings tools. Figure 6-196 shows 
our map.
21. ThingLink 
ThingLink is a tool that allows users to enhance 
images and videos with embedded content 
such as notes, audio, photo, video, and other 
multimedia content. Educators can sign up for a 
free account.
In this project, students will insert themselves 
into a bird’s-eye-view map of their school’s 
library, classroom, or any other interesting 
location. Then they will research various 
elements of the space and the work done there 
and add multimedia content so that virtual 
“visitors” can grow to know more about the 
learning environment.
Setup
We have many visitors to our resource center, 
and we are very eager to share our passions with 
them. Some visitors, though, cannot make it 
in person. For this reason, we wanted to create 
a virtual tour of our Library and makerspace. 
Students will do the same for their school.

Students could use ThingLink and green screens 
to augment research projects. Students could 
create a “living timeline” and film various 
segments of a famous person’s life in front of 
a green screen and then add in background 
elements or features. By combining them with 
ThingLink, the multimedia interactive project 
can be self-contained and easily shared.

ChatterPix Kids is a free app that allows 
you to make anything “talk.” Simply take a 
photograph, draw a line over the mouth, record 
what you want to say, and share. The app allows 
users to add fun stickers and other special effects 
and then share in a variety of formats.
In this project, students will use the green 
screen to place a photograph of themselves in 
front of a winter-themed background. They will 
then use the ChatterPix Kids app to make their 
photographs speak.

Instructions for Students
1.	 Brainstorm where you would like to be in 10 
years. Where do you hope to live and work? 
What do you hope to have accomplished? 
Decide on five questions you would like to 
“ask” your future self.
2.	 Use the Google Slides app to create a title 
slide and “cue cards” that will appear in the 
movie (Figure 6-217).
3.	 After creating each of the “slides,” take 
screen shots of each and save them to the 
camera roll.
4.	 Open the Tellagami App (Figure 6-218).
23. Autobiography of  
Your Future Self
Tellagami is a free app (with in-app purchases) 
that allows you to create a virtual avatar for 
which you can record your own voice and speak 
text that you enter for it. The app allows you 
to customize the look, mood, and clothing and 
even set how your avatar appears. These fun 
short videos can then be shared quickly and 
easily. 
In this project, students will imagine 
themselves 10 years into the future. They will 
ask themselves five questions and then answer 
as their future self, thanks to Tellagami. The 
“gami” will be combined with a video of the 
student asking the questions.
Setup
This project is a great way for students to think 
about their future and how they hope it will turn 
out. They will have a chance to “interact” with 
the future selves they hope they will become.

voice as the “gami” or type the text that you 
would like your “gami” to speak. For this 
project, record your voice. (You can record a 
maximum of 30 seconds in the free version 
of the app.) To create the illusion that your

camera roll. Follow this same process for 
each of the five questions.
11.	 Next, record a video of you in front of the 
green screen with the iPad camera asking 
each of the five questions. (Remember 
that you will need to be silent for 10 to 15 
seconds after asking your question so that 
your “gami” can answer. It will be easier 
if you have your partner stop and save 
each individual answer and response as a 
separate movie).
12.	 Next, combine both you and your “future 
you” together in the green screen. Open the 
Do Ink app, and create a new project.

24. Shadow Dancing
This project comes from an amazingly creative 
art teacher from Arlington Heights, IL. Tricia 
Fuglestad pushes apps beyond their limits and 
discovers fun and unique ways to combine them 
with other apps. 
In this project, students will learn to apply a 
green screen technique using the Green Screen 
by Do Ink app that creates a silhouette, copies it, 
and changes the transparency to create a shadow 
and then layer it over a background (Figure 
6-232).
Setup
The project connects dancing, music, and visual 
art while teaching about shadows, transparency, 
silhouettes, complementary colors, digital 
layering, and movement.

Tricia’s website (http://drydenart.weebly.com/) is 
full of incredible explorations of all aspects of 
green screens and the visual arts. She explores 
both still and moving silhouettes with her 
students and truly pushes the limits of many apps.

making it the middle layer (Figure 6-234).
3.	 Create a silhouette by clicking on the 
color wheel button, and choose a spot on 
the other side of the color wheel for the
