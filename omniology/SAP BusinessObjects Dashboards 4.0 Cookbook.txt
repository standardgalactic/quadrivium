Foreword
The original (and key) innovation of Dashboard Design was to bring together the flexibility, 
power and ubiquity of Excel with the visualization of Flash. This meant that a whole 
new group of people (basically anyone who understood Excel formulas) could produce 
sophisticated Flash animations. Over the years, this has led to an incredible array of 
Dashboard Design models being produced, many of which, I suspect, go well beyond 
what the creators of Dashboard Design intended (or even dreamed of). Indeed there 
is one model (you can find it at http://www.antivia.com/confoundingmodel/) 
which has been doing the rounds for a number of years that, so rumor has it, left even 
the original Dashboard Design development team scratching their heads as to how it 
was constructed.
As with any tool that has the flexibility and power to be stretched in this way, it is hard for 
the core product documentation to comprehensively cover everything users need to know 
to be successful, and it is books such as this one that fill the gap and allow knowledge 
that has been distilled through the hands of many individuals to be passed on to the 
community in general.
I am a particular fan of the recipe format; it allows you to dip in and out of the material 
for learning in short bursts and also allows you to quickly and easily answer specific 
questions. In addition, the overall structure provides a smooth flow through all the areas 
of the product providing a comprehensive review of its capabilities.
In this book, Xavier and David have found something for everyone. For those who are just 
starting out with Dashboard Design, there are recipes that give advice and guidance to 
help you start on a solid foundation. For those who are more experienced with Dashboard 
Design, there are advanced recipes covering inter-dashboard communication and 
connectivity to external systems. For everyone, there will be something in these pages 
which is new and will help you take your Dashboard Design knowledge to the next level.
My favorite recipes are in the third-party chapter, not just because I work for one of 
the vendors featured, but because they advertise the possibilities opened up by the 
Dashboard Design SDK. Although the initial innovation of Dashboard Design was bringing 
together the Excel and Flash visualizations, the introduction of the SDK paved the way 
for a second wave of innovations from third parties, which further widened the bounds of 
what was possible with this amazing product.

Whatever plans you have for Dashboard Design, I wish you luck; keep pushing the 
boundaries and share your experiences with the rest of us in the community.

Preface
What is SAP Business Objects Dashboards 
(formerly Xcelsius)?
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards (formerly Xcelsius) is a desktop dashboard and visualization 
solution that is a core part of SAP BusinessObjects BI 4.0. Once a user creates a dashboard 
model, it can be deployed in Flash format to Web portals, SAP environments, the SAP 
BusinessObjects BI platform, and desktop applications such as PowerPoint, Word, or PDF. 
For Dashboard designers/developers, SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards allows for rapid 
development of data visualizations through a flexible and easy to use graphical user interface. 
Using Xcelsius, we can accomplish the following:
Create interactive dashboards that have a wow factor, unlike other dashboard 
tool competitors
Connect dashboards to 12 different types of data connections
Integration and interoperability with the existing SAP BusinessObjects BI Content
We can embed our dashboards into a variety of different formats to allow for 
convenient sharing between users
Ability to create custom add-on components using the Dashboard Design SDK

Preface
2
Xcelsius, in its original conception, was a way to build visualizations and 
dashboards using Excel data. Over the past several years, SAP Business 
Objects has enhanced Xcelsius into a full-featured enterprise ready 
dashboard solution that works with any data source. As SAP continued on 
its mission to make Xcelsius a dashboard product to serve all its customers 
(beyond being just a personal productivity tool), the name Xcelsius was 
no longer meaningful or relevant. The BI market and SAP customers were 
also demanding an enterprise dashboard solution for the types of projects 
they were using Xcelsius for; that is dashboards for thousands of users. By 
changing the name Xcelsius to SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards, SAP is 
showing its commitment to delivering a solution that serves the needs of all BI 
customers as well as aligning the name to the product's growing capabilities 
and roadmap.
The SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards portfolio consists of several different 
packages (see the edition comparison on next page). In this book we use 
Dashboard Design to refer to the tooling itself.

BusinessObjects Dashboards spreadsheet, the data model, and connections with the 
components on the canvas.
Chapter 2, Data Visualization: This chapter presents users with recipes on how to use 
different components such as charts, tables, and graphs to visualize data on the dashboard.

Requirements: This appendix lists some helpful online resources for further reference and 
some useful Microsoft Excel functions supported by SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards.
What you need for this book
The following image provides a comparison of the different dashboard design packages 
offered by SAP. You will need to install one of the dashboard design packages in order to 
use this book.

Preface

Note: The majority of recipes from Chapters 1 to 8 can be accomplished 
with all of the dashboard design packages. Only for the recipes that require 
connecting to an SAP environment or using SAP related data sources in 
Chapters 9 and 10, do you need SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards.
Who this book is for
If you are a developer with a good command and knowledge of creating dashboards, but are 
not yet an advanced SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards user, then this is the perfect book 
for you. You should have a good working knowledge of Microsoft Excel, as well as knowledge 
of basic dashboard practices, though experience of SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards as a 
specific dashboard tool is not essential.
This book provides an interactive hands-on approach to SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 
education by allowing you to work with components, learn best practices, and practice trouble 
shooting techniques.
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of 
information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text are shown as follows: "You must be able to view hidden files and folders in 
the C:\Documents and Settings\ your_user_id folder."
A block of code is set as follows:
final String BO_CMS_NAME = ""server"";  
final String BO_AUTH_TYPE = ""secEnterprise"";
New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in 
menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "In the Scale section, select 
the Auto radio button."
Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.
Tips and tricks appear like this.

Staying in Control
In this chapter, we will cover:
Making the spreadsheet more readable with colors
Making the spreadsheet more readable with comments
Making the spreadsheet more readable with borders
Using Named Ranges
Selecting all worksheet cells with one click
Copying the format of one cell to another cell or range
Debugging the spreadsheet
Navigating between worksheets
Grouping canvas components
Introduction
During the development of a typical Dashboard Design dashboard, the number of 
components on the canvas increases steadily and the exact type of used components may 
change over time. Also, several interactions between components are added and maybe one 
or more connections with external data sources are created. All those canvas components are 
bound to the Excel data model that has been defined in the spreadsheet area. 
To prevent us from getting lost in an unmanageable chaos of components, interactions, 
bindings, and several different Excel functionalities, a structured approach should be followed 
right from the start of the dashboard development. Also, we should use the advantages Excel 
gives us to build an optimal data model that is easy to read and maintain.

Making the spreadsheet more readable with 
colors
To make clear what the exact purpose of a cell is we need a set of guidelines to follow.
Getting ready
You need a basic Dashboard Design dashboard containing a few components in the canvas 
with some bindings to the data model in the spreadsheet.
How to do it...
1.	 Go to your data model in the spreadsheet.
2.	 Select the cell(s) you want to color.
3.	 Click on the Fill Color button and select the desired color. You can find this button in 
the Font section of the Home tab.
4.	 Color the cells that have dynamic visibility values in orange.
5.	 Color the cells with input values from canvas components yellow. In the following 
screenshot, row A3:N3 is used as the destination range for a drill down from a chart.
6.	 Color the cells that will be filled with data from an external data source in blue.
7.	
Color the cells with Excel formulas in green.

Chapter 1
9
How it works...
A cell in an Excel spreadsheet can have several different roles. It can contain a fixed value, 
it may show the result of a (complex) formula, and it can be used by formulas in other cells. 
Within Dashboard Design, an additional role can be recognized—the insertion role. In this type 
of cell, an interaction from an Dashboard Design component results in a certain value being 
inserted into this cell.
There's more...
To make the data model readable, not only for yourself but also for others, it is helpful to 
create a legend in your spreadsheet that explains what each color represents. Any color 
scheme can be used, but it is important that you stick to the chosen scheme and use it 
consistently throughout the development of your dashboards. 
Make sure that you add another worksheet to your spreadsheet to place this legend in. You 
can also use this overall summary worksheet to include the information such as project name, 
description, uses, version (history), and so on.
Making the spreadsheet more readable with 
comments
Sometimes cells need additional information to explain how they are used. Of course you can 
write this text as a label in another spreadsheet cell, but a better solution is to use comments.
Getting ready
You can use the same basic dashboard as for the previous recipe.

Staying in Control
10
How to do it...
1.	 Right-click the cell to which you want to add the extra information. 
2.	 Choose Insert Comment.
3.	 Add your text. A small red rectangle will appear in the right upper corner of the cell.
4.	 Now hover your mouse over the cell and the comment you just entered will appear.
How it works...
Comments are related to one spreadsheet cell only and are only shown if you hover the 
mouse over this cell. This is a great way to document information that you do not need 
to see all the time, which keeps your data model clean.

A good case to use this is when you are building a dashboard with multiple layers in 
combination with dynamic visibility. You might use numbers to identify each layer and use 
a cell to contain the number of the active layer. You can use a comment to describe the 
meaning of these cell values.
A little remark about the usage of comments is that they do increase the size of the 
Dashboard Design file a bit. 
Making the spreadsheet more readable 
using borders
To separate cells from each other and create different areas within a spreadsheet, you can 
use cell borders.
Getting ready
You can use the same basic dashboard as for the previous examples.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the cell(s) you want to add a border to and right-click. 
2.	 Now select Format cells....

Staying in Control
12
3.	 Go to the Border tab.
4.	 Select the desired style of the border line. 
5.	 Select on which side(s) of the cell(s) the border should appear.
6.	 Click on OK.
There's more...
Toolbar border button
Instead of right-clicking the cells and using the Format Cells option you can also use the 
Border button on the toolbar to adjust the border styles for a cell or a group of cells. You can 
find this Border button in the Font section of the Home tab. If you select the cell(s) and click 
on this button, a list of options will be shown, which you can choose from.

Chapter 1
13
Use multiple worksheets
You can use borders to split data within a spreadsheet. But if your Dashboard Design dashboard 
contains data from a lot of different (functional) areas, it is recommended that you split your 
spreadsheet in several sheets. This will help you to keep your dashboard maintainable. 
A good strategy to split up the spreadsheet is to divide your data in different areas that 
correspond to certain areas, layers, or tabs that you created on the dashboard canvas. You 
can also use separate sheets for each external data connection. Give each worksheet a 
meaningful name.
Place your logic wisely
Another general guideline is to place as many cells with logic and Dashboard Design 
interactivity functionality at the top left of the spreadsheet. This place is easy to reach 
without a lot of annoying scrolling and searching. Even more importantly, your data set may 
grow (vertically and/or horizontally) over time. This can especially be a risk when you are using 
an external data connection, and you don't want your logic to be overwritten.
Using named ranges
With named ranges, it is possible to define a worksheet cell or a range of cells with a 
logical name.
How to do it...
1.	 Select a range of cells (for example B1:B12).
2.	 Put a description (for example Total_Sales) for this range in the Name Box in the 
upper left-hand side of the worksheet. 
www.allitebooks.com

3. Now this named range can be used in formulas in other worksheet cells. Type the 
formula =SUM(Total_Sales)in cell B13.
How it works...
Using named ranges makes your formulas more readable, especially when you are working 
with multiple worksheets and using formulas that refer to cells on other worksheets.
There is more...
Defined named ranges
By clicking on the little triangle in the Name Box, it will show a list of all your defined named 
ranges in all your worksheets. 
Name Manager
If you use a lot of named ranges, the Name Manager can be a helpful tool to manage your 
named ranges. Here, you can also edit and delete the existing named ranges. You can find 
the Name Manager under the Formulas tab or by using the shortcut Ctrl-F3.

Selecting all worksheet cells with one click
With a click of the mouse button, we can select everything on a worksheet.
How to do it...
If you want to select an entire worksheet without having to drag your mouse to select 
everything, you can just click on the half triangle on the top left corner of the worksheet.

Staying in Control
16
How it works...
Clicking on the half triangle button will allow you to select the entire worksheet with just one 
click. Here are some reasons why we would want to select an entire worksheet:
With an entire worksheet selected, you can easily apply formatting or change 
attributes to all cells.
You can copy the selection from one workbook and paste it onto a worksheet from 
another workbook. A common use would be copying data elements from an external 
spreadsheet and pasting it onto the internal Dashboard Design spreadsheet.
You can easily perform row height or column width formatting that will apply to all 
rows or columns in that spreadsheet.
There's more...
Another way of selecting everything on a worksheet is using the Ctrl+A shortcut.
Copying the formatting of one cell to 
another cell or range
This recipe shows you how to copy the formatting of one cell to another cell or range. For 
example, we can copy a yellow background and Calibri font from cell A1 to cell A2.
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the source cell that you want to copy the formatting from.
2.	 Click on the Format Painter icon which you can find on the Clipboard section of the 
Home tab.



Chapter 1
17
3.	 Click on the cell or range that you want to copy the source cell's formatting to.
How it works...
The Format Painter works by taking the source cell that you have selected and applying the 
formatting to the cell(s) that you paint to.
This is very useful because we can copy cell formats without having to perform a copy and 
paste special every time.
For Dashboard Design developers, it happens very often where we have to copy colored 
cells that represent different types of logic such as dynamic visibility cells, insertion cells, 
and so on.

An alternative to accomplishing the same task is to copy a cell and then click Paste Special... 
and choose to Paste Formats only.

Debugging your spreadsheets
It is common that Dashboard Design developers may accidently put in the incorrect formula 
when developing logic on their spreadsheets. Using the Ctrl +` hotkey will make things 
much easier.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the worksheet you want to see formulas for.
2.	 Hit the Ctrl key and ` (grave accent) key together.
3.	 You will see the value in the cell change to the formula.
How it works...
The hotkey Ctrl+` works by showing the underlying formula of a cell. This is extremely useful 
if you are comparing formulas from multiple cells, the reason being that the developer does 
not have to flip between formulas in order to see what they are doing wrong when comparing 
multiple cells. Developers can quickly analyze their worksheet and find the cause of their 
problem quickly.
The following screenshot shows the results of two Excel formulas in cells A1 and A2:

Chapter 1

After using the Ctrl+ ` hotkey, the formulas of both cells are displayed as you can see in the 
next screenshot:

An alternative way to accomplish the same task is to go to the Formulas tab and then click on 
Show Formulas. Refer to the following screenshot:

Navigation between worksheets
It is often the case that when we are developing Dashboard Design dashboards, we run out 
of room for our worksheet tabs. We then have to scroll through each tab in order to get to the 
one that we want; this is kind of a pain. To access tabs that are not visible, we are used to 
pressing the arrow keys to move to the desired tab.
How to do it...
1.	 To have all tabs displayed in one menu, right-click on the tab at bottom, left-hand side 
navigation area. You will then see the list of tabs that you can choose from.

Chapter 1
21
2.	 You can also use Ctrl + PageUp, which will move to the previous sheet in 
your workbook.
3.	 Ctrl + PageDown will activate the next sheet in the workbook.
How it works...
The methods explained work by allowing developers to move between worksheets more 
quickly. Being able to quickly right-click and show a menu of all available tabs is faster than 
scrolling through each tab in order to reach tabs that are not visible. In addition, the ability to 
use a hotkey to cycle through each tab brings some time savings benefits for those who are 
comfortable with using the keyboard to perform all their actions.
Grouping the canvas components
Canvas components can be grouped with one or more other components.
Getting ready
Drag several components to the canvas.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the components that you want to group by either selecting them by dragging 
the mouse over the components, or clicking the components one-by-one while 
holding the Ctrl button on your keyboard.

Staying in Control
22
2.	 Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select Group from the context menu. You 
can also use the shortcut Ctrl + G to group these components. As you can see, 
the components are now a group with a common border (Dynamic Visibility and 
Entry Effect):
And some shared preferences (Dynamic Visibility and Entry Effect):
3.	 If you create a lot of groups of components, we advise that you name these groups to 
prevent you from getting lost and confused during the dashboard development. First 
go to the Object Browser.
4.	 Select the group you want to rename.

Chapter 1
23
5.	 Double-click the group or right-click and select Rename from the context menu.
6.	 Type in the new name for this group.
How it works...
When your dashboard gets more complex, not only will the data model in the spreadsheet 
grow, the number of components used on the canvas will also increase. Using groups to 
differentiate the canvas components from each other is a great way to stay in control of 
your dashboard.
There's more...
Besides browsing through your (grouped) components, the Object Browser has two additional 
options which come in very handy during the development of a complex dashboard.
Hiding components
Firstly, you can hide components and/or groups of components, which will make your 
life easier if you are using a lot of overlaying components. By checking Hide for some 
components, you won't be bothered by these components and you can work with the 
components that are unhidden.
There is one thing you should keep in mind: If you hide a component that is 
part of a group and the group itself is unhidden, the complete group will still 
be movable and its properties will be changeable.
Locking components
Secondly, the Object Browser gives us the possibility to lock one or more components and/or 
groups of components. Doing this makes it impossible to select these components so it won't 
be possible to move, change, or do anything else with it.
www.allitebooks.com

Staying in Control
24
Hiding or locking components is easy. In the Object Browser you will see two symbols with 
two columns of dots beneath them. The first column is the 'hide' column; the second one 
defines which components are locked. To hide or lock a component, you just have to click on 
the correct dot in the row of the component. The dot will be replaced with a checkmark. In the 
following screenshot, you can see that the Budget group is hidden while the Actual group 
is locked:

Data Visualization

Introduction
Data visualization may be the most important topic when we are talking about dashboard 
creation. It enables us to view data, compare values, and make analysis in a clear and 
effective way. A dashboard is the ideal platform to present these visualizations. 
Data can be presented in a graphical way, for example with lines, bars, colored areas, gauges, 
or just with a simple red/green indicator. But on the other hand, in some cases, it may be 
more effective to use a simple list of values instead of these graphs. This totally depends on 
the purpose of the dashboard.
Dashboard Design provides a great toolkit with lots of visualization components. This chapter 
will discuss these components and show you how to use them.
Adding a line chart to your dashboard
 A line chart is very useful to visualize data that changes over time. It consists of a set of data 
points that are connected by a line. The horizontal x-axis typically shows the categories in 
which the data is divided. The vertical y-axis shows us the values. 
This recipe shows how to add a line chart to a dashboard and how to link it to the data in 
the spreadsheet. Also, we will discuss the components that are similar to the line chart 
component—Bar chart, column chart, area chart, and stacked charts. 
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file and enter the data into the spreadsheet, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 2
27
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Line Chart component from the Components browser into the canvas.
You can also click on the Line Chart component in the 
Components browser, move your cursor to the canvas 
area (the arrow will now change into a cross), and click 
again. You can use whatever method you prefer. 
2.	 Select the Line Chart component you just added to the canvas by clicking on it. Now 
the component is surrounded by eight blocks that enable you to adjust the size of 
the component. 

Data Visualization
28
3.	 The properties pane for this component is also visible now. By default, the General 
tab is selected. In the Data section we can bind the data we entered earlier in the 
spreadsheet to this component. Click on the button on the right-hand side of the By 
Range field. 
4.	 In the spreadsheet, select the range from A4 to E7 and click on OK. The data is now 
bound to the component. 
5.	 The Data section of the properties pane now looks like the following screenshot. The 
chart will already show the data series we just bound.

Chapter 2
29
6.	 In the same way, we can add titles to this chart. Select spreadsheet cell A1 and enter 
Sales data; also, enter 2011 in cell A2.
7.	
Bind the Chart field in the properties pane with spreadsheet cell A1 and bind the 
Subtitle field with cell A2. 
You can also enter a value in these title 
fields directly. 
8.	 In the Category (Y) Axis field, enter Tonne.
9.	 Your setup should now look like the following screenshot. Click on the Preview button 
to try the dashboard. 

Data Visualization
30
How it works...
This recipe showed how to connect the data in one or more spreadsheet cells to the Line 
Chart component through several options in its properties pane. This is how we bind data and 
you will be using this a lot during the development of dashboards with Dashboard Design. 
There's more...
Manually binding data
In this recipe, we used a pretty straightforward data set with the category labels in the first 
row (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4) and the series names in the first column (Apple, Banana, Cherry). 
Dashboard Design is able to understand this data set and bind this information automatically. 
This may not always be the case, and therefore not always lead to the visualization you had 
in mind. 
To change the direction of the visualization of the spreadsheet data in the chart, you can 
select the Data in Columns option in the Data section of the properties pane. This will switch 
the series and the labels. 
By clicking on By Series in the Data section of the properties pane, it is possible to manually 
adjust all binding settings for the name and values of each series. Additionally, you can select 
the axis a series should be plotted on (primary or secondary). You can change the series order 
by using the two arrow buttons and add or remove series by using the + and - buttons. Also, 
you can manually bind the category labels to a range of cells. 

Chapter 2
31
Hide/show series
Series in a chart can be hidden or shown by the user when using the dashboard.
1.	 Go to the Appearance tab and select the sub-tab Layout.
2.	 Make sure that Enable Legend is selected.
3.	 Select Enable Hide/Show Chart Series at Run-Time.
4.	 Set Interaction to Check Box. 
Other charts: bar chart and column chart
The bar chart and column chart components can be configured in exactly the same way as a 
line chart component. A bar chart presents values in horizontal bars while the column chart 
uses vertical bars. These types of charts are typically not used to present data over a long 
time period, but to show data from different categories that need to be compared. 

Data Visualization
32
Other charts: area chart
The area chart component is a line chart with a filled area beneath the line. Other differences 
between these types of charts are that for the area chart the first value (Q1) is plotted on the 
far left-hand side and the last value (Q4) on the far right-hand side of chart. An area chart 
is used to visualize the cumulated total value over a period of time. This component can be 
configured in the same way as the line chart component. 
Other charts: stacked charts
The bar chart, column chart, and area chart component all have a stacked version—stacked 
bar chart, stacked column chart, and stacked area chart. These stacked chart components 
show the values for the series on top of each other in the same column. You can use the 
stacked charts if the dashboard user needs to be able to compare totals.
Using the bullet chart
The bullet chart is in fact a bar or column chart with a lot of extra options. Besides visualizing 
a data point like how the bar and column charts do, the bullet chart is able to show a target 
and two or more qualitative ranges. These ranges can indicate whether a value can be 
considered as bad, satisfactory, good, and so on. 

Chapter 2
33
This recipe will show you how to configure a bullet chart. Dashboard Design has two bullet 
chart components—a horizontal and a vertical version. Both components have exactly the 
same configuration options and work in the same manner. This recipe will use the horizontal 
bullet chart.
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file and enter the data into the spreadsheet, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Horizontal Bullet Chart component into the canvas.
2.	 Bind the By Range field to the spreadsheet range from A4 to E7.
www.allitebooks.com

Data Visualization
34
3.	 Also bind the Chart field in the Titles section to spreadsheet cell A1 and bind the 
Subtitle field to cell A2. Your setup should now look like the following screenshot:
4.	 Hit the Preview button and hover on the different sections of the bars. The 
dashboard now shows the detailed information we just bound. 

Chapter 2
35
How it works...
As already stated at the beginning of this recipe, the bullet chart components can show a 
result value, a target, and qualitative ranges. Furthermore, each series can have its own 
label and sub label. Let's have a look at exactly how these variables are configured in the 
previous recipe. 
First, select By Series in the Data section of the properties pane for the Horizontal Bullet 
Chart component; then, select the Apple series. You can now see the detailed bindings 
Dashboard Design made for this series. 
The Label field is bound to spreadsheet cell A5 (Apple). We did not edit the Sub-Label field so 
this remains empty, but you can bind it to a cell with a certain value or enter a value in this 
field directly. The result value, cell B5 (2200), is bound to the Performance Value field, which 
is presented in the chart by a small horizontal bar. Next the target value of cell C5 (2000) is 
bound to the Comparative Value field. This value is visualized by a vertical dash. There are 
two cells that are bound as Scale Values: D5 (1800) and E5 (2400). Using two values means 
that the chart will show three areas—0 - 1800, 1800 - 2400, and 2400 - max. You can use as 
many values as you need. These areas are shown in the chart as three colored blocks in the 
background. If you don't use scale values, there won't be a colored block in the chart. 

Data Visualization
36
There is more...
The bullet chart in the recipe uses the same x-axis for all three series. It is also possible to 
configure separate x-axes.
1.	 Select the Bullet Chart component and go to the Behavior tab. Select the Scale 
sub-tab.
2.	 Select Configure scale by series. Now you can edit the scaling settings for each 
series separately. 
3.	 Go to the Appearance tab and select the Text sub-tab.
4.	 Here, you can select which Horizontal Axis Labels should be shown. 

Chapter 2
37
Using sparklines
Sparklines are typically small graphics, showing a horizontal line connecting several data 
points without labeling the values on its axes. The purpose of the sparkline is to show the 
movement of a trend over a certain period. Since its details are not available, the context of 
a sparkline must be clear to the dashboard user to interpret its meaning properly. This recipe 
will show you how to configure a sparkline.
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file and enter the data into the spreadsheet, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Sparkline Chart component into the canvas.
2.	 Bind the By Range field to the spreadsheet range from A4 to M5.
3.	 Bind the Chart field to cell A1 and bind the Subtitle field to cell A2. 
4.	 Go to the Behavior tab of the properties pane of the Sparkline Chart component. In 
the Normal Range Area section, select Normal Range Area.
5.	 Enter the value 600 in the Normal Range Low field and enter 1000 in the Normal 
Range High field. 

Data Visualization
38
6.	 Go to the Appearance tab and select the Text sub-tab. 
7.	
Select Show for the Start Value.
8.	 Set the Position for this Start Value text to Left.
9.	 Select Show for the End Value. 
10.	 Now go to the Color tab and select all Markers.

Chapter 2
39
11.	 Your dashboard should look like the following screenshot:
How it works...
The configuration of the General tab within the properties pane of a sparkline chart 
component looks like the configuration of a line chart component. But, a sparkline chart 
component has fewer options here: No axis and no category labels can be defined. 
With the Normal Range Area in the Behavior tab, is it possible to illustrate that the values 
of this series should be between what boundaries. Also, the start, end, the highest, and the 
lowest values of the presented series can be emphasized. 
There's more...
Header labels
Header labels can label two parts of the sparkline chart component: The series name(s) and 
the sparkline(s). To activate these labels follow the given steps:
1.	 Bind the Header Labels field in the General tab to two spreadsheet cells. 
2.	 Enter the value for the series name(s) header in the first cell, and enter the 
sparkline(s) header value in the second cell.
3.	 Now go to the Appearance tab and select the Text sub-tab. 
4.	 Select Header Labels. The labels will now appear in the component. 

Data Visualization
40
Show low and high values
Besides the start and end values of a sparkline you can also show the lowest and highest 
values. In the Text sub-tab of the Appearance tab, you can select them to be visible.
Using the combination chart
With the combination chart you are able to use both columns and lines to visualize data in 
one single chart. 
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file and enter the data into the spreadsheet as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Use the Percent Style option to convert the market share values into percentages. You can 
find this option in the Number section of the Home tab of the toolbar.

Chapter 2
41
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Combination Chart component to the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Chart field to cell A1 and the Subtitle field to cell B2.
3.	 Bind the By Range field to the spreadsheet range from A4 to E6.
4.	 Select By Series and select the Market Share series. Select the option to Plot Series 
On: Secondary Axis.
How it works...
After binding the data to the component, we had to adjust the Market Share series to plot its 
data on the secondary axis. After doing this, a second y-axis appeared on the right-hand side 
of the chart, labeled with percentages.

Data Visualization
42
There is more...
In the Series sub-tab within the Appearance tab of the properties pane, you can determine 
how each series should look—either a column or a line. Here, you can also set the series 
colors and Marker Shape, Size, and Transparency. 
Using the pie chart
The pie chart is circular chart divided in one or more slices. Each slice represents the 
proportion of a value to the total of all values. Pie charts can be used to show the impact of 
a value in contrast to other values or the grand total. However, it may be hard to compare the 
size of slices within a pie chart when there are more than three slices, or across other pie 
charts. Therefore, if you need to compare data, we recommend using the bar chart instead.

Chapter 2
43
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file and enter the data into the spreadsheet, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Pie Chart component onto the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Values field to spreadsheet cells B5 through B7.
3.	 Bind the Labels field to cells A5 through A7.
4.	 Bind the Chart field to cell A1 and the Subtitle field to cell B2.
www.allitebooks.com

Data Visualization
44
5.	 Preview the dashboard.
How it works...
We bound the fields from the General tab to the data in the spreadsheet making this chart 
to show the three labels and the according portions of the total in a pie. Obviously, the pie 
chart component cannot use multiple series of data like the line chart component and other 
chart components. 
Using the XY chart
An XY chart, or scatterplot, can display values that consist of two variables. The chart shows 
a set of points that, for each point, refer to a combination of a value on the X-axis and a value 
on the Y-axis.
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file and enter the data into the spreadsheet, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 2
45
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a XY Chart component into the canvas. 
2.	 Bind the data By Range to spreadsheet cells B5 until C9.
3.	 Bind the Chart field to cell A1 and delete the subtitle.
4.	 Bind the Value (X) Axis field to cell B4 and the Value (Y) Axis field to cell C4. Now it is 
clear what the implication is of each axis. 
5.	 Go to the Behavior tab and select the sub-tab Scale. Now select Fixed Label Size. 
How it works...
In this example, we created a dashboard that compares the price of a house (variable 1) with 
the number of weeks until it is sold (variable 2). It shows us that cheap houses are sold very 
quickly, the houses priced between cheap and expensive (midclass) take a very long time to 
sell, while the expensive houses are somewhat in between.  
Using the bubble chart
A bubble chart can display values that consist of three variables. The only difference with the 
XY chart is that the size of the points in the bubble charts is adjustable. Next to the value on 
the X and Y-axes this is the third variable that can be illustrated with this chart. 

Data Visualization
46
Getting ready
You can reuse the dashboard from the Using the XY chart recipe and add the values in the 
D-column as shown in the following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Bubble Chart component into the canvas. 
2.	 Bind the data By Range to spreadsheet cells B5 through D9.
3.	 Bind the Chart field to cell A1 and delete the subtitle.
4.	 Bind the Value (X) Axis field to cell B4 and the Value (Y) Axis field to cell C4. 
5.	 Go to the Behavior tab and select the sub-tab Scale. Now select Fixed Label Size. 
How it works...
In addition to the analysis we made in the Using the XY chart recipe, we can now also see that 
the number of houses for sale in the midclass market is very high, while the availability in the 
expensive market is very low. 

Chapter 2
47
Using the radar chart
The radar chart is able to represent more than two variables in a single chart. Therefore, this 
chart has multiple axes that all start in the same point. The radar chart can be used to make 
comparisons between series, based on their score on a set of variables.
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file and enter the data into the spreadsheet as shown in the 
following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Radar Chart component to the canvas.
2.	 Enter a name and subtitle for the chart.
3.	 Bind the cell range A4 to F6 to the By Range field.

Data Visualization
48
How it works...
Our dataset has two series and five categories. The chart has an axis for each category and 
on these axes the accompanying values are plotted for each series. The values of a series are 
connected with a line. 
There is more...
The filled radar chart component does the same job as the radar chart component and has 
the same configuration options. The only difference is that the area between the connected 
value points is filled with a color in the filled radar chart component.
Using the OHLC chart and candlestick chart
The OHLC chart and candlestick chart are both designed to show the movement of a stock 
price over time. OHLC stands for Open, High, Low, and Close. These four stock price values are 
illustrated for each time unit. 
Both components work in exactly the same way, so you can use both the OHLC chart 
component and the candlestick chart component for this recipe. The only difference 
between them is the graphical visualization.

Chapter 2
49
Getting ready
For this recipe, we need some historical stock data. Open your browser and go to 
http://www.nasdaq.com/ and look for historical quotes on the SAP AG stock. 
Select a timeframe of one month and copy-paste the quotes to the spreadsheet of a new 
Dashboard Design file.
How to do it...
1.	 First we need to prepare the data in the spreadsheet. It is now sorted from new 
to old quotes. As the OHLC Chart component does not enable sorting (see the 
recipe Sorting series later in this chapter) we have to sort the data ourselves in 
the spreadsheet. First, select all the cells you just pasted into the spreadsheet. 

Data Visualization
50
2.	 Sort this selection by using the Sort & Filter function in the Editing section of the 
Home tab of the spreadsheet toolbar and choose the Sort Oldest to Newest option. 
3.	 Add an OHLC Chart component to the canvas.
4.	 Enter a chart title and subtitle, or bind these fields to cells in the spreadsheet. 
5.	 Bind the data By Range to the range of cells that include all values in the Open, 
High, Low, and Close columns. 
6.	 Select By Series and enter SAP in the Series Name field.
7.	
In the dataset we copied from the NASDAQ website and pasted to the spreadsheet, 
the dates are in the first column. Bind the Category Labels field to the cells in the 
Date column.

Chapter 2
51
How it works...
The OHLC chart we just created works as follows: The vertical lines show the price range (from 
the highest to the lowest value) of a stock for each day. The little mark on the left of these 
vertical lines indicates the opening price. The little mark on the right indicates the closing 
price. In addition to this, a set of a line with marks has a dark color if the closing price is lower 
than the opening price and a light color if the closing price is higher than the opening price. 
The candlestick chart shows exactly the same data as the OHLC chart. In the candlestick 
chart a rectangle is used to illustrate the opening and closing prices. If this rectangle is 
transparent, the closing price is higher than the opening price and if it's filled the closing 
price is lower.

Sorting series
A chart does not always look like what you had in mind. In some cases, you may want to see 
data sorted from high to low values, while in other situations, you want to see the categories 
to be displayed in a more logical order. For example, in the following bar chart, the quarters 
are sorted from last (Q4) to first (Q1). To change this, you can of course adjust the data model 
in the spreadsheet, like we did in the Using the OHLC chart and Candlestick chart recipe. An 
easier and better way is to use the Sorting settings for the bar chart component. 
Sorting is available in the following components: line chart, pie chart, column 
chart, stacked column chart, bar chart, stacker bar chart, combination chart, 
area chart, stacked area chart, radar chart, and the filled radar chart.
Getting ready
You can reuse any of the dashboards you created earlier, as long as they contain one of the 
components listed above.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the component, go to the Behavior tab, and select the sub-tab Common. 
2.	 Select Enable Sorting.
3.	 Select By Category Labels.
4.	 Select Reverse Order.

Chapter 2
53
How it works...
As you can see in the previous screenshot, the order of the quarters has changed. In 
Dashboard Design, the first category is by default the lowest category on its axis. With the 
reverse order setting, this can be changed.
There is more...
Besides sorting on category labels, it is also possible to sort by data. If you have more than 
one series, you have to choose one of these series to base the sorting order on. 
The following chart shows the data shown in an ascending order:
Zooming in on charts
If you are visualizing a data set with a large number of values on the x-axis, the chart might be 
a bit hard to use. To see a section of such a chart in more detail, we can use the range slider 
to zoom in on the data. 
The range slider option is available in the following chart components: line 
chart, OHLC chart, candlestick chart, column chart, bar chart, stacked 
column chart, stacked bar chart, combination chart, area chart, and the 
stacked area chart.

Getting ready
You can reuse any of the dashboards you already made, which include one of the components 
mentioned above. In this recipe we will use the dashboard created in the Adding a Line chart 
to your dashboard recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the chart, go to the Behavior tab and select the Common sub-tab.
2.	 Select Enable Range Slider. 
3.	 At Beginning Range Value select Category Label and enter value Q1.
4.	 At End Range Value also select Category Label and enter value Q3.
5.	 Bind the Range Labels field to cells B4 until E4.
6.	 Go to the Appearance tab and select the Text sub-tab. Select Range Labels and set 
the text size to 8.
7.	
Run the dashboard by hitting the Preview button and try the functionality of the 
range slider.

Chapter 2
55
How it works...
The range slider option makes it possible to select a section of the chart by sliding the 
beginning and end values of this range. In this recipe, we used the category labels to define 
the initial range values. You can also choose to use the Position field and enter the position of 
the desired value in its series. Q1 would be position 1 and Q3 would be position 3. 
Scaling the y-axis
After binding a chart to a data set in the spreadsheet, Dashboard Design makes up a scale 
on the y-axis by default, based on the lowest and the highest values in the visualized data set. 
The problem with this auto scaling is that it creates a y-axis that doesn't start with 0, which 
may cause a bad interpretation of the data. 
In the following image, the same results are presented in two bar charts. The chart on the left-
hand side gives the indication that Product B has performed a lot better than Product A; the 
bar is more than two times as big! This is of course wrong, as the y-axis starts with $470,000. 
The chart on the right-hand side shows a version that is way more useful for analysis:
Getting ready
You can reuse any of the dashboards you already made with chart components. In this recipe, 
we will use the dashboard created in the Adding a Line chart to your dashboard recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the chart, go to the Behavior tab and select the Scale sub-tab. If your 
chart has a secondary axis, there will be two sub-tabs—Primary Scale and 
Secondary Scale.

Data Visualization
56
2.	 Select Manual (Y) Axis.
3.	 Enter 0 as Minimum Limit and 1000 as Maximum Limit.
4.	 Select Fixed Label Size.
5.	 Set the Size of Divisions to 200 and Minor Divisions to 1.
How it works...
The y-axis of the chart will now have a fixed minimum and maximum limit. Remember that 
this also means that values bigger than 1000 won't be displayed correctly with these settings. 
They will be placed on the maximum value (1000) of this chart. 
The Fixed Label Size option keeps the labels on the y-axis readable. 1000 will be 1K, 
1,000,000 is 1M, and so on. 

Chapter 2
57
There is more...
Variable maximum limits
To make sure that values in the data set never pass the maximum limit, we can use a variable 
maximum limit. 
1.	 Go to the spreadsheet and enter the following formula in cell D1: =MAX(B5:E7). This 
will result in the maximum value of the range B5 through E7. 
2.	 Bind the Maximum Limit to cell D1. The y-axis will now display the exact maximum 
value that resulted from the formula.
3.	 To make this value a more rounded number we have to adjust the formula. Change 
the formula to: =ROUND((MAX(B5:E7)),-3). The -3 indicates that the value will be 
rounded to the nearest thousand. So if the maximum value is 1978, the maximum 
limit on the y-axis will be 2000. -1 rounds to the nearest tens, -2 to the nearest 
hundred and so on. 
Allow Zoom Out Only
If you do want to use an automatic axis, Dashboard Design offers the Allow Zoom Out Only 
option. This option is only useful if a data set that is presented in a chart is variable (for 
example by switching with a selector; see Chapter 3). By selecting this option, the y-axis 
will only scale to larger values when a data set is presented that has higher values. If the 
values are smaller, the scale will not change. With the slider, you can set the sensitivity of 
the growth factor.
Using the tree map
The tree map visualizes values by dividing an area into a set of rectangles. The 
following image shows an example of a tree map: 


Data Visualization
58
As you can see, two variables are used in this chart—one variable expressed by the relative 
size of each rectangular and another one illustrated by the color intensity. Instead of using 
the tree map, you can also choose the XY chart to display two variables in one chart.
Getting ready
For this recipe, we can re-use the file we created in the Using the XY chart recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Tree Map component to the canvas.
2.	 Enter a name for the chart.
3.	 Bind the cell range A4 to C9 to the By Range field.
4.	 Select Data in Columns.
5.	 Select By Series and bind the Name field to cell A1.
6.	 Go to the Appearance tab and select the Series sub-tab.
7.	
Select a very dark color as High Color and a very light color as Low Color.

Chapter 2
59
8.	 Preview the dashboard to check the result.
How it works...
The tree map arranges the rectangles from big to small. The Cat 5 data (most expensive 
houses) is presented on the far left-hand side, while the Cat 1 (cheapest houses) is illustrated 
by the block on the lower right-hand side. This rectangle also has the lightest color, indicating 
the lowest Weeks until sale value. In the recipe, we changed the colors to a more extreme 
range so that the differences between the rectangles are clearer.
Showing a trend without a chart
Showing a trend with a line chart is very useful if you want to show data over more than two 
periods. In some cases, all this historical information is unnecessary and you only want to 
display the direction of the trend—up, down, or no change. The trend icon component 
delivers this functionality. This recipe will show you how to use it. 
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file and enter the data into the spreadsheet as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Data Visualization
60
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Trend Icon component into the canvas.
2.	 Enter the following formula in spreadsheet cell B3: =B2-B1.
3.	 Now bind the Data field of the Trend Icon component to cell B3. The Trend Icon 
component will now turn red and show a downward arrow. 
How it works
The trend icon component can only be bound to a single cell. If this cell has a positive 
value, the component will be shown in positive state (arrow up). If the value is negative, the 
component will turn into its negative state (arrow down). If the value is zero, a neutral state is 
shown (flat line icon).
We used the formula to calculate whether the change in trend is positive, negative, or neutral. 
Displaying raw data
If you want to display numbers and text, and not by a chart, but just in a table, you can use the 
spreadsheet table component.

Chapter 2
61
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file and enter the data into the spreadsheet, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 In the spreadsheet, select cells A4 through E4. 
2.	 Add a Bottom Border by using the Borders menu of the Font section of the Home 
tab in the spreadsheet.
3.	 Select cells A4 through A7 and add a Right Border.
4.	 Drag a Spreadsheet Table component into the canvas. 
5.	 Bind the Display Data field with the spreadsheet range from A4 to E7.
6.	 Go to the Behavior tab and deselect Row in the Row Selectability section.

Data Visualization
62
7.	
Go to the Appearance tab and deselect Show Gridlines in the Layout sub-tab.
8.	 The dashboard should now look like the following screenshot:
How it works...
The spreadsheet table component shows a range of cells exactly as they are formatted in the 
spreadsheet. You can add borders, colors, change fonts, alignments, and so on. If you make 
any changes to the formatting, you have to re-bind the cells again to the component to make 
the new formatting visible.
The data insertions options, as well as the selectability options, are not used in this recipe, 
but will be explained in Chapter 3. 
Illustrating single values 
Dashboard Design offers three component types to display single values—gauges, progress 
bars, and value component. A gauge and progress bar show data on a scale, while the 
value component only shows a value in numbers. The gauge is the only component of these 
three types that has the possibility to show more than one value. There are eight different 
gauge versions available, and a horizontal and vertical version of the progress bar. All these 
components are ideally used in combination with Alerts. Alerts will be discussed in Chapter 5. 
This recipe will show you how to set up a gauge. The other two component types work in the 
same way. 
Getting ready
No preparation is needed, just open a new Dashboard Design file.
How to do it...
1.	 Add a Gauge component to the canvas. 
2.	 Enter 75 in spreadsheet cell A1 and bind this cell to the By Range field.
3.	 Select By Indicators and rename Indicator 1 to Result.
4.	 Add a second indicator by clicking on the plus button. 

Chapter 2
63
5.	 Rename this indicator to Target, enter Value 90, and select Type as Outside Marker.
6.	 Go to the Appearance tab and select the Text sub-tab. Select Show Limits and set 
size to 8.
How it works...
As you can see, binding single values works in the same way as binding data series for 
charts. The gauge component can show more than one indicator and has the option to 
enter fixed values. 

Data Visualization
64
There is more...
Scaling
Single value components can be manually scaled or auto-scaled. There are four options for 
auto-scaling:
Value-based: The limits cover a range around the value 
Zero-based: The higher limit is equal to the bound value, while the lower limit is zero
Zero-centered: The limits cover a range that includes the value and its negative/
positive with zero in the middle
Alert-based: The limits are based on the selected alert method (see Chapter 5 for 
more on using alerts)

Introduction
An important strength that Dashboard Design has is the amount of control a developer can 
provide the user with. This leads to totally customized dashboards, which gives users the 
interactivity to help guide them to make the right business decisions. It is important that 
developers know what type of interactive tools are available so that they can utilize the power 
of these tools.
With the right interactivity, users are able to retrieve information more quickly and efficiently. 
This chapter will provide developers with recipes on interactivity, which will improve the 
dashboard user experience.
Drilling down from a chart
Being able to drilldown from higher level data to more granular detail is a very important 
feature in Dashboard Design. We want to be able to retrieve high level and granular level data 
easily without hunting for it. Using drilldowns, users can easily navigate through the different 
levels of data.
Getting ready
Insert two charts onto the canvas (Parent = Column Chart; Child = Line Chart). Data from the 
child chart is driven from the parent chart. 
Please refer to the example source file Drilling down from a chart.xlf 
on how to set up and bind the data appropriately to the charts.
How to do it...
1.	 In our example, the parent chart contains Regional Sales information. The child chart 
contains a drilldown of a monthly trend.
2.	 Turn on drilldown capability from the parent chart by clicking on the Drill Down icon 
and click on the Enable Drill Down check box.

Chapter 3
67
3.	 Select the Insertion Type that you will use for the drilldown bars. In our case, we will 
drill down based on type Row and bind to the line chart data on cells D6:I9. Then 
select the destination of the drilldown value. We have selected cells D3:I3 in 
our case.
4.	 The destination cells D3:I3 control the chart data for our monthly trend data set as 
shown in the following image:

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
68
5.	 Preview the finished example and verify that the drilldown works by clicking on each 
bar of the Regional Sales chart.
How it works...
In our example, we saw how to drill down from a set of regional sales to a monthly trend for 
a selected region. In the drilldown properties screen, the source rows D6:I9 from step 3 are 
linked to each bar. When a user clicks on the bar, it will select the appropriate row from D6:I9 
and transfer it to the destination at D3:I3 where the child chart binds its data to.
There's more...
In our example, we had all the data available to us on the spreadsheet. We can also 
accomplish drill down capability on a query by sending in the drilldown parameter when 
clicking on a bar and then retrieving the appropriate child data.
Selecting your data from a list
Filtering data into a smaller dataset is a very important feature to implement when building 
dashboards. The reason being that people want to have a large amount of data available to 
them, but not to have to see all of it at once, otherwise it will become too overwhelming to the 
user and will require them to hunt for data, which is not the purpose of a dashboard.
In our example, we will be selecting from a list of regions that will populate a gauge 
value appropriately.

Chapter 3
69
Getting ready
Have your data list set ready. In our example, we will show a simple list of five elements with 
corresponding values: 
How to do it...
1.	 Select a List Box selector from the Selectors section of the Components window and 
drag it onto the canvas.
2.	 In the general section of the List Box selector, bind the labels to A2:A6, source data 
to B2:B6, and destination to D2 as shown on the image below. Select Row as the 
Insertion Type. The destination cell D2 will be the cell where the gauge is bound to.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
70
3.	 Drag a Gauge onto the canvas from the Single Value | Gauge section of the 
Components window. Bind the gauge data to cell D2. 
4.	 Preview and test your result. 
How it works...
Selecting from a list of data using an Dashboard Design selector is quite easy, as you have 
seen in the earlier example. Basically, you'll need to have a set of labels to identify the list 
items you are selecting from. You will then need your source data that relates back to the list 
of items being selected from. In our example, we used a row one cell wide as the selected 
item type. If we wanted to, we could even choose a row that's 100 cells wide. Just try not 
go to go over a width of 512 cells, otherwise you may start running into performance issues. 
Finally, the destination in our example is one row as that is what we have selected as our 
Insertion Type.
There's more...
We just showed how to use the List Box selector. However, we could have used other selector 
components to accomplish the same task such as a combo box drop down, list view, label-
based menu, spreadsheet table selector, and so on. It is important to choose the selectors 
that best fit your dashboard, visually.

Chapter 3
71
In addition, for the Insertion Type, Dashboard Design allows us to use a large amount of 
Insert Types, whether it be by filtered rows, by row, by column, by label, by position number, 
and so on.
See also
For more detailed information on using the Filtered Row, which is an advanced Insertion Type, 
please refer to the Using filtered row recipe.
Using the Filter Selector component for 
hierarchies
Dashboard Design provides an easy to use selector component for hierarchical data. For 
example we may have a hierarchy that consists of a Region | Sales District | Sales Office. 
As shown in the following image, we can easily create this with the Dashboard Design Filter 
selector component tool:
Getting ready
It is important to set up the data, as shown next, so that the filter component can consume 
it properly. Every row has to have the Region, Sales District, and Sales Office as well as the 
metric value(s) that you want populated on your destination. I've highlighted the destination 
portion in yellow and the filter related stuff in blue. Information on how everything works can 
be found in the How it works section.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
72
How to do it...
1.	 Add a Filter selector component onto the canvas and on the properties set the 
Number of Filters on the bottom to 3 as our hierarchy has three levels:
2.	 Bind the source data to the area in blue A3:D6 from the data set up in the Getting 
ready section.
3.	 Bind the destination to the cell F3 highlighted in yellow.

Chapter 3
73
4.	 Insert a Label Text object onto the canvas and bind it to destination cell F3. Preview 
and make sure the filter component works
How it works...
The filter selector component works by grouping values in each column of the source data. In 
our example we selected three filters, so the first three columns of the source data will consist 
of the three hierarchies. The main parent is the Region, and then we branch down to the 
District, and finally, the Office.
Now that we are familiar with the blue portion from the image in the Getting ready section 
in this recipe, Using the Filter Selector component for hierarchies, we'll explain what the 
yellow portion is. The yellow destination can be of arbitrary width and will consist of metrics or 
values associated with the particular hierarchy combination chosen. For example, if we select 
East | District | Office 1, it will retrieve the values corresponding to that combination row.
Note that the destination width is the same width as the second part of the source data, 
which in our case is one column.
There's more...
The dropdown filter selection component isn't the only way to select from a hierarchical 
approach. We can also try a more advanced method found in the next recipe, Alternative 
hierarchy selection method, that will show the hierarchies in a set of list boxes. This may be 
the preferred approach if a user wants to see more than one value at a time. In addition, the 
recipe Presenting Microcharts in a Tree Grid shows users how a third-party component can 
accomplish a hierarchy selection using the familiar windows tree explorer.
Alternative hierarchy selection method
When navigating through a hierarchy selection, it is often that a user wants to see a list of 
available parents or children instead of only being able to see one at a time when looking 
at drop-down filters. Here is an alternative using the more complex listbox breadcrumb type 
approach for three levels:

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
74
Getting ready
Set up the data as shown next. The blue section contains the initial full hierarchical data. 
The yellow section contains each breadcrumb trail whose source is one column less than the 
parent. More about how everything works will be explained in the How it Works section.
How to do it...
1.	 Insert three List Box selectors onto the canvas. On the first List Box selector, set the 
Labels to the Region, Column A, in blue.
2.	 Select Filtered Rows as the Insertion Type and set the Source Data to columns A 
to C. Set the Destination to columns E to G. Notice that we select all three source 
columns because the first row of the first column of the destination contains the 
selected region.

Chapter 3
75
3.	 Do the same with the next list box, except we will select the labels and filtered rows 
from the new area columns E to G.
4.	 Finally, the last child List Box will be getting its Labels from column J. We can either 
use Label or Row as the Insertion Type as we are only down to one selection column.
How it works...
In this example, each list box is a hierarchical level. In order to transfer all the appropriate 
values from one parent to the next data source, we must use the filtered rows method to 
grab all of the parent's children, until the last child where we can use label or row for the 
Insertion Type.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard

For more detailed information on using Filtered Rows, read the Using Filtered Rows recipe.
Using Filtered Rows
Filtered Rows was one of the greatest additions to Xcelsius 2008 (now SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards 4.0) from Xcelsius 4.5. If we look at the following figure, we have a set of Sales 
metrics that are grouped by Region and Office:
Let's say I wanted to be able to select a region and show a sales comparison chart between 
the different sales offices of that region. Before the advent of Filtered Rows, we would have 
to perform complex VLOOKUPs or have the result come back through a query every time a 
region is selected, which is very time consuming. 
How to do it...
1.	 We will use a Combo Box selector to choose the desired region.

Chapter 3
77
2.	 In the Combo Box selector properties, bind the Labels to the Region column circled 
in red.
3.	 Select Filtered Rows as the Insertion Type. Bind Source Data to the area circled in 
red. The Destination will contain the chart values as well as the selected region.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
78
4.	 Bind the chart values to the Destination section from step 3.
How it works...
The Filtered Rows Insertion Type allows users to select groupings of data easily without having 
to do complex VLOOKUP logic or a database querying; this allows for performance gains and 
ease of future maintenance.
Using maps to select data of an area or 
country
Maps are commonly used in dashboards to visually identify areas or regions. Using maps on 
a dashboard allows us to visually identify using a picture instead of a table/chart and see, for 
example, which regions are doing poorly versus which regions are doing well. As you can see 
looking at the map of Canada, users are able to visually distinguish between each province.

Chapter 3
79
How to do it...
1.	 Select a map component from the Maps section. In our example, we will use Canada.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
80
2.	 In the map properties, you will need to bind the region keys appropriately, as shown in 
the following spreadsheet: 
Tip for finding the map regions
A full list of the region keys for each map included in Dashboard Design can 
be found in the MapRegions.xls spreadsheet in the <install path>\
Xcelsius\assets\samples\User Guide Samples\ directory.
3.	 Next, bind the Display data which will be the key/value pair. The key comes from the 
key that you used in step 2 and the value can be any value associated to that key.

Chapter 3
81
4.	 We will now need to bind the source data. Make sure that the first column of the 
source data contains the matching key value from step 2.
5.	 The Destination will be bound to the row highlighted in yellow, as shown in the 
following screenshot: 
6.	 Now bind a spreadsheet table Display Data to the destination area in yellow. This will 
change according to the province you click on during runtime. 

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
82
How it works...
The map component works by using a key/value pair that is assigned to each map section. 
It is important that the order of items bound to the Region section is in alphabetical order. 
Otherwise the wrong keys will be bound. For example, looking at the following image, Yukon 
and Nova Scotia are in the wrong alphabetical order, thus the key/value pair will be incorrect:
The display data section in step 3 is used to show what will be displayed when a user hovers 
the mouse over a region. There are two columns that can be shown (key/value). The key must 
match a key from what was bound to the Region data, otherwise it will not show up.
Finally, we have our Source Data, and again we must have a matching key at the first column 
in order to match the correct row.
There's more...
To make the visualization even better for a map component, it is common to use alert coloring 
to show how the provinces are doing. To accomplish this, please read the recipe Displaying 
alerts on a map.
Adding a MacOSX loading dock to your 
dashboard
It is well known that Macs have a great user interface and one of the great things they have 
in particular is the program loading dock. We can emulate this in Dashboard Design using the 
Fisheye Picture Menu. But why would someone want to use the loading dock? Well, you can 
use the loading to switch between dashboards on the main dashboard. You can use it to open 
up another dashboard, or you can use it as a selector to change your charts or data. In this 
recipe, we are going to emulate the swapping between dashboards. 

Chapter 3
83
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Fisheye Picture Menu selector.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
84
2.	 We'll need to link an image of each dashboard to the Fisheye Picture Menu. To do 
this, press the Import button on the Images | Embedded section of the fisheye menu 
properties. In our example, we are using three dashboards, so click on the Click to 
Add Images button to load each of the three dashboard images.
3.	 Bind the Labels to the spreadsheet, as shown, so that the user knows the name of 
the dashboard when they hover the mouse over any of the icons. 
4.	 Bind the Source Data and Destination. In this case, we are just using the Position 
for the source. The destination will be bound to cell D2.

Chapter 3
85
5.	 Set the dynamic visibility of each dashboard to the corresponding position of the 
Fisheye Picture Menu selector. For example the HR Health Assessment dashboard 
has position 1, so in the dashboard properties, the dynamic visibility should be set to 
1 for cell D2.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
86
How it works...
The Fisheye Picture Menu is a very simple component that emulates the MacOSX loading 
dock by allowing users to scroll through icons that will zoom in as you mouse over them. As 
outlined in step 2, we can see that we have to bind the images that are similar to program 
icons. Those icons are linked to the source data in step 4.
There's more...
There is another component called the Sliding Picture menu that acts the same way and 
is set up the same way as the Fisheye Picture Menu, except that you don't get the 'zoom 
mouse-over' feature.
Resetting your data (reset button)
It is common that a user may want to go back to their default or starting point view. Let's say 
I have five selectors and modified all five of them. To get back to the starting point would be a 
pain. Thus, having a one-click approach to go back to the default can be useful. 
How to do it...
Select the Reset Button from the Other Components section and drag it onto 
the canvas.
How it works...
When you first load the dashboard, the state of the first load is remembered. So when you 
click on the Reset button, it will go back to the original state.

Making selections from a custom image 
(push button and image component)
As shown in the recipe Adding a MacOSX looking dock to your dashboard, we can use a 
Fisheye selector menu to emulate a program dock-type style when selecting items. However, 
there may be cases where we may want images in different locations that we can click on to 
perform different actions.
In this recipe, we will go through an example on how to use a push button combined with an 
image component to create a clickable image that can perform actions when clicked on.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag an Image Component from the Arts and Backgrounds section of the 
Components window onto the canvas.
2.	 Open up the image properties window and click on the Import button. Select the 
image from your computer that you want to show.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
88
3.	 Drag a Push Button object from the Selectors section of the Components window 
and put it on top of the image. Then resize the Push Button so that it is the same size 
as the image. To make the button the same size as the image, use the sizing icons on 
the toolbar circled in red. Make sure you click on the image first and then the push 
button in order for the push button to match the sizing properties of the image and 
not the other way around. 
4.	 On the Push Button properties, first bind the Source Data and Destination data 
to the appropriate cells. In our example, we want to transfer the table data from 
the yellow section to the destination section highlighted in black. Also, in the Label 
section, don't forget to delete all text.
5.	 Go to the Appearance tab of the push button and set the Transparency to 100% and 
uncheck the Show Button Background checkbox.

Chapter 3
89
6.	 Drag a Spreadsheet Table component onto the canvas and bind it to the destination 
cells D2:E6 of the push button.
7.	
Preview and make sure that when you click on the image, the details of the image 
show up on the table.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
90
How it works...
In this recipe, we overlay a push button on top of an image component. By default, an image 
component can't perform any actions, however with an invisible push button on top, it will 
seem as though we can click on the image to perform an action.

Inputting data values
The ability to input values into a dashboard is a very useful feature. An example of a useful 
situation is when a user wants to enter an exact value through a large range of numbers onto 
a 'what-if' scenario instead of having to scroll. Another good example could be a search box to 
find a value on a selector that has over 100 items. This way, you don't need to hunt for your 
value and just type it in.
In this recipe, we will create an input text box to control a what-if scenario.
Getting ready
Create a chart with its values bound to cells that will be controlled by the input text box value. 
An example of a sales forecast chart and its cells that are controlled by the what-if scenario is 
shown as follows:

Chapter 3
91
You may refer to the source file Inputting data values.xlf to retrieve 
the pre-populated data from the earlier image, if you don't want to 
manually type everything in yourself.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag an Input Text object from the Text section of the Components window onto 
the canvas.
2.	 On the properties window of the Input Text component, bind the Link to Cell and 
Destination to the yellow cell D3 from the Getting ready section.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
92
3.	 Go to the Behavior icon of the input text properties and make sure Treat All Input As 
Text is unchecked.
4.	 The blue cell D6 from the Getting ready section that's labeled as valid value will 
check to make sure the input text entered by the user is valid. To do this, we use the 
formula =IF(ISNUMBER(D3),IF(AND(D3>=-20,D3<=20),D3,"INVALID"),"INVALID").
The formula checks to make sure that the cell contains a number and is between -20 and 20.
Now every cell in the chart-binding destination will depend on D6. The binding destination 
cells will not add the D6 value if D6 is "INVALID". In addition, a pop up will show up saying 
"Input is invalid" if D6 is "INVALID".
Create the pop up by dragging a label text component onto the canvas with Input is invalid as 
its text. Next, go to the behavior tab and for dynamic visibility, bind it to D6 and set the Key as 
INVALID.

Chapter 3
93
How it works...
In this example, we use an input value text box to control the forecast bars on the chart. If 
we type 20, it will add 20 to each value in the forecast. If we type -20, it will subtract 20 from 
each value in the forecast.
We also add a check in step 4 that determines whether the value entered is valid or not. 
Hence, the reason for using the Excel formulas. If a value is invalid, we want to output an 
error to the user so that they are aware that they entered an invalid value.

Using Play Selector/Play Control 
The Play Selector component can be used when you want to change chart values or 
components on a dashboard without having the user do anything. Some common uses 
where we need an automatic change of components are listed as follows:
A company dashboard presented on a large LCD monitor in a company common 
room. This dashboard will refresh or switch views every 20-30 seconds.
A dashboard at a technical support office that shows information on calls coming 
in and how they are being handled. This dashboard changes views every 20-30 
seconds.



Chapter 3
95
In this recipe, we will create a play selector that changes the image every 20 seconds. We can 
pretend that the images are different dashboards.
Getting ready
Have a set of three images ready on the canvas and overlay them on top of each other. 
There are three dashboard images that you may use for this example. 
They are hr1.png, hr2.png, and hr3.png, and can be found in 
the images folder.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Play Selector component from the Selector section of the Components 
window onto the canvas.
2.	 In the Play Selector properties, select Row as the Insertion Type and bind the 
Source Data to the dynamic visibility rows that are set up in Column A of the 
spreadsheet. Bind the Destination to the yellow-colored cell C2, which will 
control the image shown:

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
96
3.	 Go to the Behavior icon of the Play Selector properties and check the Auto Play 
checkbox. Change the Play Time value to 20 seconds.
4.	 Go to the Appearance icon of the Play Selector properties and set the Transparency 
to 100%. Also, uncheck all the available checkboxes.
5.	 On each of the image components, set the Dynamic Visibility status binding on the 
Behavior icon to the yellow colored destination cell C2 from step 2. The key values 
will be 1, 2, or 3 depending on what order you want your images to play at. In the 
following image, I've shown the dynamic visibility example for the first dashboard:

Chapter 3
97
How it works...
In this example, we use a play selector to control which image is being shown. Each 
iteration of the play selector control is linked to one of the rows that we set up in the source 
data in step 2. In step 4, we set the transparency of the play selector to 100% because 
we want to hide the play selector but still have it active. Finally, in step 5, we configure the 
dynamic visibilities of the images appropriately so the correct one will show up as the play 
selector runs.

Opening up a Web Intelligence report using 
dashboard parameters
It is important to distinguish the difference between a dashboard and a report. A dashboard 
should be a one page visualization of the most important data a user needs to see. A report 
contains details that are usually to the lowest granularity, thus should remain at the SAP 
BusinessObjects Web Intelligence (WEBI) report level. It is a common dashboard requirement 
to drill down from a chart or scorecard to view individual detail items. Instead of showing the 
detailed items on the dashboard, we can pop up a WEBI report using parameters passed from 
the dashboard. In this example, we will pop up a WEBI report using one input parameter from 
the Dashboard Design dashboard.
Getting ready
A WEBI report with a prompt must be set up first. In our example, the WEBI report will ask for 
a Region parameter.
You can use the source file Opening up a Web Intelligence report using 
dashboard parameters.xlf as a reference to help guide you through 
the OpenDoc URL construction part of the recipe.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
98
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Combo Box selector onto the canvas and bind the label values to the list of 
Regions on the Excel spreadsheet, as shown in the next screenshot. Set Label as the 
Insertion Type and bind the Destination to the cell highlighted in yellow, which will be 
the input parameter passed to the OpenDoc call.
2.	 Log into BI Launch Pad (formerly Infoview) and go to the location of where the Web 
Intelligence report is located. Right-click and select Properties.

Chapter 3
99
3.	 Copy the CUID.
4.	 On cell B14, shown as follows, an OpenDoc URL is constructed. Paste the CUID from 
step 3 into cell B23 highlighted in gray. Cell C23 equals the Selected Region cell C2 
from step 1.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
100
5.	 Drag a URL Button component onto the canvas from the Web Connectivity section 
of the Components window. In the URL Button properties, change the Label text to 
Open WEBI report, and bind the URL to the OpenDoc URL cell B14 from step 2. 
How it works...
In this example, we use what is called an OpenDoc call to open up a WEBI report with our 
desired input parameter from the dashboard.
The OpenDoc URL is very complex, where there are many options that you can choose from 
to build the URL, and is out of the scope of this cookbook, so it is best to read the OpenDoc 
manual in order to get a list of all the options and how to use them. You can find the URLs to 
retrieve the OpenDoc manual in the See also section next.
To open up an external link from the dashboard, the URL Button component is used.
An example of a fully constructed URL is as follows:
http://server:8080/businessobjects/OpenDocument/opendoc/openDocument.
jsp?iDocID=Aun.tFH.oLtLoE901DpjK6I&sIDType=CUID&lsSRegion=EAST
There's more...
The syntax for OpenDoc on SAP BusinessObjects XIR2 is different than for XI 3.1+. Thus, the 
way you construct the URL will be different for both versions; however, the concept is the 
same. In this recipe, the OpenDoc URL was generated for Business Objects Enterprise XI 3.1+.

Selecting calendar dates
Calendars are a common component found in dashboards if a user is interested in seeing 
values on a particular day. This is great for going back in history to see our past performance.
In this example, we will work with one month of data for September 2010 and the chart will 
change according to what the user selects on the calendar.
Getting ready
The spreadsheet portion containing the chart data will need to be set up in the following 
fashion. Each row of chart data will belong to a selectable day in the calendar. In this example, 
each row contains region sales data for a particular date.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
102
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Calendar component from the Other section of the Components window onto 
the canvas. 
2.	 In the Calendar properties, select Date as the Insertion Type and bind the 
Destination to the cell G3 of the spreadsheet, as shown next:
3.	 Now, we will need to take the value from the destination date cell G3 in step 2 to 
find the corresponding row data from the Getting Ready section. To do this, drag 
a Combo Box selector onto the canvas. In the Combo Box properties, select Row 
as the Insertion Type and bind Source Data to the chart data set. Then bind the 
Destination to the cells to the spreadsheet area in yellow (H3:K3). You will also 
need to set the Labels to the date values of the dataset.

Chapter 3
103
4.	 On the Behavior icon of the combo box selector, bind the Item from the Selected 
Item area to the Destination cell G3 of the Calendar set from step 2. Then drag 
the Combo Box selector to the same position as the chart, and order the Combo 
Box selector to the back so that the user cannot see the Combo Box selector 
during runtime.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
104
5.	 Bind the Chart data to the chart destination cells H3:K3 from step 3.
How it works...
In this example we use a combination of a calendar date component, a combo box selector, 
and a column chart component. The calendar date component controls the date selected in 
step 1. Then the combo box selector will connect the date to the appropriate data row from 
the chart data set in steps 3 and 4. Finally in step 5, the chart is bound to the correct data 
row that was selected in steps 3 and 4.

selector in Chapter 2, Data Visualization.

Using sliders to create a what-if scenario
What-if scenarios are very important as they allows users to project what future values will 
look like, depending on one or more variables.
In our recipe, we will reuse the simple what-if scenario from the recipe Inputting data values. 
The only difference here is that we will use a horizontal slider instead of inputting the values 
with text.
Getting ready
Set up the sales data, as shown circled in red in the following screenshot, and have a column 
chart ready on the canvas:

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
106
How to do it...
1.	 Insert a Horizontal Slider component from the Single Value – Horizontal Slider 
section of the Components window.
2.	 Set the Title text to Forecasted Change. Bind the Data to cell D3 highlighted 
in yellow. Set the Minimum Limit to -20 and Maximum Limit to 20 on the 
Scale section.
3.	 Go to the Appearance section of the slider properties and make sure that the Limits 
checkbox is checked.

Chapter 3
107
4.	 Now in the blue chart data area, each formula will be adding the what-if value D3 to 
the chart data values B3:B6 prepared in the Getting ready section. 
5.	 Bind the Forecast Chart values in blue to the Chart component and then preview.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
108
How it works...
In this example, the slider controls the what-if value on cell D3. The chart data cells G3:G6 
then use the appropriate calculation—taking the user what-if rate, adding it to the current 
sales value, and displays the correct chart data.

Password protecting your dashboard
Introduction
Dynamic visibility makes it possible to control the visibility of components. With this 
functionality, a component can be made visible or hidden on a running dashboard, 
based on a status value that is inserted in a certain spreadsheet cell.
Dynamic visibility is useful when your dashboard contains many visual components and 
you don't �������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
 want to overload the user with information. Usually, it is used in combination with 
selectors that let the users choose what they want to see and when. 
Switching between different charts
This recipe will show you how to create a dashboard with the possibility to switch between 
two charts.
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file and drag two different chart components (for example, 
a line chart and a pie chart component) to the empty canvas. Drag the label-based menu 
component to the canvas, as well.

How to do it...
1.	 Click on the line chart component and go to the Behavior tab of its properties pane. 
At the bottom of the pane, you will see a section called Dynamic Visibility.
2.	 Bind the Status field to spreadsheet cell B1.
3.	 Put the value 1 in the Key field.
4.	 Click on the pie chart component and go to the Behavior tab.
5.	 Here you also bind the Status field to cell B1.
6.	 In the Key field, you fill in the value 2.
7.	
Go to the spreadsheet and type Status: in cell A1 and put value 1 in cell B1.
8.	 Now click on the label-based menu component and go to the General tab of its 
properties pane.
9.	 To set the labels, click on the button on the extreme right-hand side. 
10.	 Enter two labels: Trend and Division. Make sure that Trend has the first position and 
Division has the second position. You can change this by using the little arrows on 
the bottom left-hand side of the window.

Chapter 4
111
11.	 In the Data Insertion area, set the Insertion Type to Position. 
12.	Bind the Destination field to spreadsheet cell B1.
13.	Click on the Preview button to run the dashboard. You will now only see the label 
component. If you click on line chart or pie chart the selected chart will appear. 
Now leave the preview mode.
14.	 To display an initial chart (shown before the first selection) you have to deselect 
the Clear Destination When No Selected Item option in the General tab of the 
properties of the label-based menu component.

Dynamic Visibility
112
15.	Place both charts on top of each other. Use the options in the Format menu for 
precise alignment and sizing.
16.	 Try your dashboard!
How it works...
In this recipe, we used one of the selector components in combination with dynamic visibility 
functionality to switch between the two charts. Each chart got a unique key assigned: value 
1 for the line chart and value 2 for the pie chart. By making a selection in the label-based 
menu selector, either the value 1 or the value 2 was put in spreadsheet cell B1. The Dynamic 
Visibility setup in this recipe implies that if cell B1 has value 1, the line chart will be shown. If 
cell B1 has value 2, the pie chart will be shown.
Thus, a component is hidden when any other value than its key is entered in the status cell.
There's more...
Other components
This recipe used two chart components with Dynamic Visibility settings. But, the dynamic 
visibility functionality is embedded in all other Dashboard Design components too, except for 
the �����������������������������������������
 ����������������������������������������
source data component. You can even use Dynamic Visibility with grouped components 
to dynamically show or hide a group of components!

Chapter 4
113
Status values
Besides numerical values, you can use any value you want as a dynamic visibility key for a 
component. If you do this, make sure you also change the Insertion Type of your selector 
component into label. Of course the labels should be exactly the same as the values used for 
the keys.
Building a pop-up screen
This recipe will show how a pop-up screen can be created within a dashboard. Such a 
pop-up screen can, for example, be used to provide additional information to the contents of 
the dashboard. In this recipe, the pop-up screen can be activated and deactivated by clicking 
on buttons.
Getting ready
No specific preparation is needed for this recipe. You can use any dashboard you already 
created or just start with an empty one. In this example, we will use the dashboard from the 
previous recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a background component into the canvas.
2.	 Drag the label component on top of the background component and enter some text.
 
3.	 Now drag a push button component into the canvas and position it in the upper right-
hand side corner of the background component. Rename its label into Close. We will 
use this button to close the pop-up screen. 

Dynamic Visibility
114
4.	 Set up the spreadsheet: Enter value 1 in cell E1 and value 0 in cell E2. 
5.	 Bind the Source Data field of the push button component properties to spreadsheet 
cell E2 and bind the Destination field to cell E3.
6.	 Group the three components (see the recipe Grouping the canvas components in 
Chapter 1, Staying in Control).
7.	
Add another push button component to the canvas and rename its label as Info. This 
button will be used to activate the pop-up screen. 
Bind the Source Data field of this second push button component to spreadsheet cell 
E1 and bind the Destination field to cell E3.

Chapter 4
115
8.	 Now we are a ready to set up the dynamic visibility functionality. Select the grouped 
components and go to the properties pane. You will see only one Common tab now. 
Bind the Status field to spreadsheet cell E3. Also, put the value 1 in the Key field.
9.	 Preview the dashboard to test the functionality!
How it works...
In this recipe, we combined the push button functionality with dynamic visibility. The three 
grouped components are only visible when the Dynamic Visibility status is 1 (spreadsheet 
cell E3). When clicking on the push button Info, the value 1 is put into spreadsheet cell E3. 
Now the grouped components appear. After clicking on the Close push button, the value 0 
is put into this cell and the grouped components will disappear as the status cell does not 
match value 1 anymore.

Dynamic Visibility
116
There's more...
After clicking on the Info push button, the pop-up screen appears. Now this button does not 
have any useful functionality: Nothing happens if you click it as the pop-up screen is already 
active. To make this button disappear, you can easily use the dynamic visibility functionality 
you already set up!
1.	 Go to the Behavior tab of the Info push button properties pane.
2.	 Bind the Status field to spreadsheet cell E3 and enter value 0 into the Key field. 
3.	 Now preview the dashboard to see the effect.
Creating a mouse-over help text pop-up
This recipe shows how you can create a pop-up screen that is activated by moving the mouse 
over a certain area of the dashboard. This can be handy if you want to add some minor 
additional information on a specific part or functionality of the dashboard.
Getting ready
No specific preparation is needed for this recipe. You can use any dashboard you already 
created or just start with an empty one. In this example we are reusing the dashboard we 
created in the previous two recipes.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a chart component (for example a pie chart component) into the canvas. If 
you are using an existing dashboard you can use one of the components of your 
dashboard instead.
2.	 Drag a label component into the canvas and enter the text you want to show.
3.	 Go to the properties pane of this label component. Select the Appearance tab and 
select the Show Fill option. 

Chapter 4
117
4.	 After this, select the Show Border option and set the Border Thickness to 2.
5.	 Move the label component over the chart. 
6.	 Now drag a toggle button component into the canvas and position it on top of the 
title of the chart you added to the canvas in step 1. Resize it so that it covers the 
total area above the chart, as shown in the following screenshot:

Dynamic Visibility
118
7.	
In the Toggle Button properties pane, go to the General tab. Bind the Destination 
option to spreadsheet cell H1. 
8.	 Put value 0 in cell H1:
9.	 Now go to the Behavior tab. Under Interaction Options in the Common menu, 
change Mouse Click to Mouse Over.
10.	 Now go to the Appearance tab and set the Transparency to 100% under the 
Layout menu.

Chapter 4
119
11.	 Also, under the Text menu within the Appearance tab, deselect the Show Labels 
option. Now the component won't be visible anymore on the canvas.
12.	To finish this recipe, we have to set up the dynamic visibility functionality for the 
label component. First, select the label component. Go to the Behavior tab in the 
properties pane. Within the Dynamic Visibility section, bind the Status field to 
spreadsheet cell H1. Also put value 1 into the Key field.

Dynamic Visibility
120
13.	Now your dashboard is ready to be tested. Hit the Preview button and see 
what happens!
How it works
For this recipe, we used the toggle button functionality in combination with dynamic visibility. 
Also, instead of clicking on the toggle button to activate it, we switched the insertion trigger 
from Mouse Click to Mouse Over. If you run the dashboard and hover the mouse over the 
upper part of the dashboard, the toggle button component will put value 1 in spreadsheet cell 
H1. This cell triggers the dynamic visibility of the label component that will now appear. 
If you go to the properties pane of the toggle button component, you can set the Source 
Data, which is in the General tab. Here, you can define which values should be put into the 
Destination cell.
The following screenshot shows the source data table:

Chapter 4
121
Keep in mind that if you cover a certain section of your 
dashboard with a toggle button component to evoke this 
Mouse Over activation, the interactivity options of the 
underlying components cannot be used anymore!
Password protecting your dashboard
In this recipe, we will look at a scenario that uses some basic login functionality for an 
Dashboard Design dashboard. Before you can use the actual functionality of the dashboard, 
a password has to be entered.
Getting ready
For this recipe you can use any dashboard you created before. We will use the dashboard we 
created in the previous recipes. 
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a rectangle component into the canvas and resize it so that it covers the 
whole dashboard.

Dynamic Visibility
122
2.	 Go to the properties pane of the rectangle component and switch the Type setting 
from None to Solid. You can also change the color and the level of transparency here.
3.	 The result should look like the following screenshot:
4.	 Add a label component to the canvas and place it in the middle of the dashboard. 
5.	 Enter the following text: Please enter your password:. In the Layout menu of the 
Appearance tab, you can check the Show Fill option to show a background color for 
this component. 

Chapter 4
123
The canvas should look like the following screenshot:
6.	 Now add an input text component and place it below the label component. In 
the General tab of the properties pane, you should bind the Destination field to 
spreadsheet cell K2. In the Behavior tab, check the option to Enable Password 
Protection. This ensures that only asterisks (*) are displayed when the user enters 
the password.

Dynamic Visibility
124
7.	
Select the three components you just added and group them.
8.	 Go to the properties pane for the grouped components. It is time to set up Dynamic 
Visibility. Bind the Status option to spreadsheet cell K1. Enter value 1 in the Key field. 
9.	 Now we have to set up some Excel logic to make this work. In spreadsheet cell K1, 
enter the following formula: =IF(K2="YourPassword",0,1), where 'YourPassword' 
should be replaced with a password of your choice.
10.	 Your spreadsheet should now look like this:
11.	 Hit the Preview button and try to log in to this dashboard by entering your password.
How it works...
In this recipe, the dynamic visibility functionality is now used to make some parts of the 
dashboard disappear instead of showing them. The dynamic visibility status is now set by 
an Excel formula. This if then' formula checks whether the value in the input text component 
matches YourPassword or not. If it does match, the result of the formula will be a 0 and the 
layer we put on top of the dashboard will disappear. Now you can use the dashboard.
This is a method that can be used to protect your dashboard for unauthorized 
access. However, in an enterprise environment, when the Dashboard Design 
dashboard is published in SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise, the security is 
managed by the BusinessObjects Enterprise platform.

Using Alerts
In this chapter, we will cover:
Adding alerts to a column chart 
Using alerts in a gauge
Making alert ranges dynamic
Displaying alerts on a map
Displaying alerts of different thresholds on a map
Using bindable colors to control alert coloring from a central location
Using alerts in a scorecard
Introduction
Dashboard Design provides a flexible way of alerting a user when something special has 
occurred. This can be a variety of events, be they positive or negative. For example, if certain 
offices have hit a target threshold for sales, we may want to show these to highlight the 
positives. If offices fall below a certain threshold for sales, we may also want to highlight 
these so that we can compare the offices and figure out how to improve the lagging offices.
Adding alerts to a column chart
When looking at a bar chart, we may want to see which items are below or above a particular 
threshold. In this recipe, we will learn how to add alerts to a bar chart. Our example will 
consist of a column chart with a list of regions and their sales. Each region column will be 
colored appropriately, depending on their sales value vs. threshold.

screenshot. You'll also need to insert a Column Chart component onto the canvas.
How to do it...
1.	 First we'll need to bind the sales data to the chart, as shown next:

Chapter 5
127
2.	 Go to the Alerts section of the chart properties and ensure that Enable Alerts 
is checked.
3.	 Select alerts By Value as we will be comparing our sales data to the threshold values. 
4.	 In the Alert Threshold section, click on the Use a Range checkbox. Bind the data to 
the threshold data that was set up in the Getting ready section. 
5.	 In the Color Order section, select the radio button High values are good.
6.	 In the following screenshot, you will then see that the bars on the chart are now 
colored according to the sales thresholds:

Using Alerts
128
How it works...
In this recipe, binding the initial data is straightforward but the part you'll want to take note of 
is setting up the alerts.
Note that there will always be N-1 (N minus one) number of threshold values 
if you are binding the range to your data. For example, if I had two colors (red 
and green), I would only have one threshold value. If I had four colors, then I 
would have three threshold values set up on my spreadsheet.
In step 4, we bind the threshold range to cells D3 and E3 prepared in the Getting ready 
section. Anything that is equal to or greater than the yellow threshold value but less than the 
green threshold value will be colored as yellow. Anything that is equal to or greater than the 
green threshold value will be green.

Data Visualization.
There's more...
Let's say you wanted to display a critical alert that would stand out even if one region was 
below a threshold. You can accomplish this by following the recipe, Using bindable colors.
Using alerts in a gauge
A gauge is a commonly used dashboard component because it allows users to easily visualize 
how a particular value is doing. Using a gauge with alert thresholds provides great value. 
We are able to visually perceive how a value is doing compared to a set of thresholds. The 
following image shows a gauge with colors representing how well we are doing in terms of 
# of Errors:
In this recipe, we will show how to set up alerts on a gauge component.

Chapter 5
129
Getting ready
Have your gauge component inserted onto the canvas.
The gauge only has one value, so we will only require a single cell to hold that value.
Also, we will need to have the threshold values set up in cells C3 and D3.
How to do it...
1.	 In the Gauge properties, bind the gauge data to cell A3 from the Getting ready 
section marked in yellow. In the Scale section, select the Auto radio button.

Using Alerts
130
2.	 Go to the Alerts section of the gauge properties and ensure that Enable Alerts 
is checked. 
3.	 Select alerts By Value, as we will be comparing our gauge value to the 
threshold values. 
4.	 In the Alert Threshold section, click on the Use a Range checkbox. Bind the data to 
the threshold cells C3:D3 prepared in the Getting ready section. 
5.	 At the bottom of the Alerts properties, there is a section called Alert Location. 
Make sure that Background and Marker are checked. You will now see that the 
sections of the gauge and gauge needle are colored appropriately, as seen in the 
next screenshot:
How it works...
In this recipe, binding the initial data is straightforward but the part you'll want to take note of 
is setting up the alerts.

Chapter 5
131
Note that there will always be N-1 (N minus one) number of threshold values, 
if you are binding the range to your data. For example, if I had two colors (red 
and green), then I would only have one threshold value. If I had four colors, 
then I would have three threshold values set up on my spreadsheet.
In step 4, we bind the threshold range to cells C3 and D3. Anything that is equal to or greater 
than the yellow threshold value but less than the green threshold value will be colored as 
yellow. Anything that is equal to or greater than the green threshold value will be green.
Making alert ranges dynamic
It is common that different dimensions contain different thresholds for alert metrics. For 
example, sales threshold targets may be different for each region of a company, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
In our example, we have four regions and different thresholds for each region. So anything 
below the yellow threshold value will be red, anything that is equal to or greater than the 
yellow threshold but less than the green threshold will be yellow, and anything equal to or 
greater than the green threshold value will be green.
The following recipe will contain a column chart that contains monthly values for a selected 
region. As the user changes their region selection, the alert threshold will also change. The 
appropriate alert coloring for each bar will be displayed on the chart.

Using Alerts
132
Getting ready
We will have one worksheet that contains the threshold values as well as a spot that will 
house the thresholds for the selected region. Please refer to the first screenshot from the 
introduction of this recipe. This is how the threshold data layout will look. There will be 
another worksheet Chart Data that contains the chart data.
How to do it...
1.	 Insert a Column chart and a Combo Box selector onto the canvas.
2.	 Open the Combo Box selector properties and bind the Title and Labels to the cells 
shown in the following image:

Chapter 5
133
3.	 First, we will set up the threshold value by linking to the appropriate label. In the 
Data Insertion section of the Combo Box properties, rename the text to Threshold. 
Then set the Insertion Type: as Row. Bind the Source Data to cells A2:C5. Bind the 
Destination to the section highlighted in yellow E3:G3.
.

Using Alerts
134
4.	 Next, you will need to press the + button on the Data Insertion section to add 
another row selection. Name the next insertion type as Chart Data. Set the Insertion 
Type to Row. Go to the Chart Data worksheet, bind the Source Data to cells A2:F5, 
and then bind the Destination Data to cells H3:M3.
5.	 Bind the chart data to the Chart Data worksheet cells that we populated from step 4. 
Set the Subtitle of the chart to cell H3, which contains the selected region name.

Chapter 5
135
6.	 Go to the Alerts section of the Chart Properties and check the Enable Alerts 
checkbox.  
7.	
Select the radio button that says By Value.
8. 	 In the Alert Thresholds section, check the Use a Range checkbox and bind to the 
cells F3:G3 on the Thresholds worksheet.
9.	 In the Color Order section, select the radio that says High values are good.
How it works...
In our example, we bind the alert thresholds in steps 6 through 9 to the cells that dynamically 
change according to the user selected dropdown. The first threshold, which is red, is anything 
that is less than the yellow threshold value on cell F3. The yellow threshold is anything greater 
or equal to the yellow threshold value on cell F3 but less than the green threshold value 
on cell G3. The green threshold is anything that is greater or equal to the green threshold 
value on cell G3. Using the bindable range in the Alert Thresholds section, we are able to 
dynamically change our threshold settings. 

Using Alerts
136
There's more...
In this example, we hardcode all the threshold and chart data values. But in reality, we can 
populate the values in the yellow destination cells of steps 3 and 4, using any of the available 
Dashboard Design data connectivity options.

For using different data connectivity options, please read the recipes in Chapter 8, 
Dashboard Connectivity. 
Displaying alerts on a map
A map on a dashboard allows us to visually identify how different regions are doing using a 
picture instead of a table or chart. With alerts on the map, we can provide even more value. 
For example, look at the following image. We can see that different regions of the map can be 
colored differently depending on their value. This allows users to identify at a glance, whether 
a region is doing well or poorly. 
Getting ready
Insert a Canadian map object onto the canvas and bind data to the map. We will use the 
same example from the recipe Using maps to select data of an area or country.
You may also refer to the data prepared in the source 
file Displaying alerts on a map.xlf.

Chapter 5
137
How to do it...
1. 	 In a separate area of the spreadsheet (highlighted in yellow), we will set up the 
threshold values. Assume that all provinces have the same threshold.
2.	 Go to the Alerts section of the Map properties and check Enable Alerts. 
3.	 Select the radio button By Value.

Using Alerts
138
4.	 In the Alert Thresholds section, check User a Range. Then bind the range to the 
Threshold data set in step 1.
5.	 In the Color Order section, select the radio High values are good.
How it works...
In this recipe, we show how to set up alerting for a map component. The way we set it up is 
pretty standard from steps 2 through 5. Once the alerting mechanism is set up, each province 
in the map will have its value associated with the alert threshold that we have set up in step 
1. The province will be colored red if the sales value is less than the yellow threshold. The 
province will be colored yellow, if the sales value is greater or equal to the yellow threshold but 
less than the green threshold. The province will be colored green if the sales value is greater 
or equal to the green threshold.
There's more...
In our example, we assumed that all the provinces have the same threshold. There is also a 
way to set up alerts so that each province can have their own threshold. The following recipe, 
Displaying alerts of different thresholds on a map, will explain how to accomplish this. We 
can also use the GMaps plugin found in the recipe Integrating Google Maps with the GMaps 
plugin to accomplish the same task but in a more flexible fashion.

Chapter 5

In this recipe, we reused the data setup from Using maps to select data of an area or country. 
Please read that recipe to learn how to bind data to a map. In addition, if you are interested 
in how to set different thresholds for each province, please read the next recipe, Displaying 
alerts of different thresholds on a map. Finally, read Integrating Google Maps with the GMaps 
Plugin for more advanced mapping capabilities. 
Displaying alerts of different thresholds 
on a map
The previous recipe was really useful in showing how we can incorporate alerts onto a map. 
However, the threshold values for all provinces were the same. In reality, this may not be the 
case for metrics, such as sales. For example, a province such as Nunavut is much smaller 
than Ontario, thus should not have the same sales threshold as Ontario.
Getting ready
Insert a Canadian map component onto the canvas and bind data to the map. We will use the 
data setup from the recipe, Integrating Google Maps with the GMaps plugin to select data of 
an area or country. 
Please refer to the first screenshot in the introductory section of the recipe 
Making alert ranges dynamic, to understand how the data should look.
You may also refer to the data setup in the source file Displaying alerts of 
different thresholds.xlf.

Using Alerts
140
How to do it...
1.	 To the right-hand side of the Sales (column B), we will add the target thresholds for 
each province. The larger provinces will have a target threshold of 250, whereas the 
smaller provinces will have a target threshold of 150. It is important that you use 
key/value relationship for the thresholds, as shown next, for the map component:
2.	 Go to the Alerts section of the map properties and check Enable Alerts. 
3.	 Select the radio button As Percent of Target: and bind to the key/value pair cells 
C2:D14.
4.	 For the target percentage, we will have anything on target or above as green. Color 
anything between 70% of target and the target as yellow. And color anything less 
than 70% of the target as red.

Chapter 5
141
How it works...
As you can see, using the As Percent of Target option on the Enable Alerts, allows us to have 
a different threshold for each province, which would give a more realistic alerting mechanism.
It is important to note that you must use a key/value pair relationship when 
using the As Percent of Target alerting mechanism on a Map component. 
For alerting on the Chart components, you don't have to worry about the key/
value pair relationship.

In this recipe, we reused the data set up from the recipe Using maps to select data of an area 
or country.
Using bindable colors to control alert 
coloring from a central location
With the advent of being able to dynamically bind colors to different parts of a component, we 
can push alerting to another level. For example, we may have a sales chart for a set of regions 
and want to signal if something is critically bad. Instead of having a bunch of green and red 
bars that may look like a Christmas tree, we can set the chart background color to red if one 
of the values has reached a critical point. In this scenario, a user will be drawn to the chart 
right away, as it will be screaming alarm bells.

Using Alerts
142
Getting ready
Be sure to have your chart data ready, shown as follows. In this recipe, we will have a set of 
sales data for each region.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Column Chart from the Charts section of the Components window onto 
the canvas.
2.	 Bind the chart data to the data set up in the Getting Ready section.
3.	 Create a section in the worksheet that will contain the critical threshold value. If any 
region sales go below that value, we want a major alert to show up. 
 

Chapter 5
143
4.	 Bind cell F5, which determines the background color, to the background color 
property of the chart.
How it works...
Using bindable colors, we are able to dynamically set color properties for almost any component. 
In our example, we use a simple COUNTIF statement to determine if any of the region sales 
are below the critical threshold. From there we have another IF statement that determines the 
coloring of the chart background. The first case (left-hand side graph in the next image) shows 
that all our sales are above $200, thus the chart background is normally white. The second case 
(the right-hand side graph of the next image) shows that the West region is below $200, thus a 
major alert is shown and the chart background becomes red.

There are many ways to customize alerting for different components. Our example only shows 
one way to do so. The easiest way can be found in the recipe Adding alerts to a bar chart. To

Dashboard Look and Feel.

Using alerts in a scorecard
One of the most useful features that came out in Xcelsius 2008 SP3 was the scorecard 
component. With the scorecard component, we are able to easily create scorecard KPIs 
with the ability to insert a user desired alert/trending icon in any column of the scorecard.
Before the advent of the scorecard component, developers would have to use either a 
Listview selector or Spreadsheet Table selector, and then overlay a Label Based Menu 
selector or individual alert/trend icons in each column that required alerting/trending.
This was a huge hassle, as developers had to use a major workaround in order to implement 
the commonly used scorecard feature.
In this recipe, we will go through an example of using the scorecard component to show a 
table of values, a threshold indicator that will determine if the current months sales meets the 
threshold or not, and a trend indicator that shows if the current month sales has risen/fallen 
compared to the previous month sales.
Getting ready
Set up your data as shown as follows. We have a list of regions, current month sales, 
previous month sales, and sales threshold. Note that I highlighted the Month to Month 
Change column because it can either come from the external data source or it could be 
calculated on the Excel spreadsheet.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Scorecard selector from the Selectors category of the Components 
window and drag it onto the canvas.

Chapter 5
145
2.	 Bind the scorecard component to the spreadsheet data prepared in the Getting 
ready section.
3.	 We will now set up the alert components. First, we will set up a calculation on column 
F of the spreadsheet, which will determine whether the threshold indicator for the 
current month will be green or red. Use the incremental formula =IF(B2 >= E2, 1, -1), 
with each row on column F.

Using Alerts
146
4.	 Go to the Alerts section of the Scorecard properties and check the Current Month 
Sales checkbox.
5.	 Bind the Alert Values to cells F2:F5.
6.	 Select the By Value, right below the Alert Values: section.
7.	
On the Alert Thresholds section, delete the yellow color by clicking on the X button in 
the second last column.
8.	 In the Alert Thresholds section, go to the To value of the first row and change it to 0.
9.	 In the Color Order section, select the High values are good radio button.

Chapter 5
147
10.	 In the Alerts section of the Scorecard properties, check the Month to Month 
Change checkbox.
11.	 Bind the Alert Values to cells D2:D5.
12.	Select the By Value, right below the Alert Values: section.
13.	Set the Alert Threshold values to what is shown in the following image. The numbers 
will be explained in the How it works... section.

Using Alerts
148
14.	 Click on the highlighted icon in the Enable Auto Colors section and select the arrow 
icons that we've circled in red.
15.	On the Color Order section, select the High values are good radio button.
16.	 Go to the Appearance section of the Scorecard component. Select the Text tab. 
Uncheck the Month to Month Change checkbox because we only want to see the 
trending icon here and not the text.

Chapter 5
149
How it works...
Basically, in the scorecard component, we are able to combine different types of alerts 
together with our table data, as shown in the following image. Now let's explain some 
important points from the steps in the How to do it section.
In step 2, you will notice that we do not bind to the Sales Threshold column because that 
column is used to calculate whether the Current Month Sales are above or below the Sales 
Threshold. As you can see in step 3, we have column F that houses the calculation. The 
calculated values in column F are then bound as the alert values in step 5. From there, we are 
able to determine if the threshold indicator on the Current Month Sales column should be 
green or red.
The Trend icons shown in the Month to Month Change column are determined from the 
values on the Month to Month Change column. In step 13, you will notice the funny 0.00001 
values. This is to take into account Month to Month change values that are 0. Unfortunately 
we are not able to set (if value = 0, then show no change arrow), so 0.00001 is the next 
closest alternative. On the column Month to Month Change we want to show the arrows, so 
in step 16, we hide the text values.

Introduction
In the previous chapters, we already discussed the functionality and applicability of a lot of 
Dashboard Design components. In this chapter, we will be looking at a number of components 
that have a somewhat unique, non-standard functionality, but that may deliver great added 
value for your dashboards.

Printing your dashboard
The Print button has a single and pretty straightforward functionality—it will print your 
dashboard.
Getting ready
You can use any dashboard you created before or just open a blank new Dashboard 
Design file. 
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Print button component onto the canvas. 
2.	 Go to the Behavior tab and select Scale to. 
3.	 Set the scale to 70%.
4.	 Try the Print button by previewing the dashboard.
How it works...
After clicking on the Print button you will see a standard Windows print window, where you 
can select and configure a printer, and set the number of copies to be printed. 
As we saw in the previous, short recipe, the only specific settings for this component were 
the Print Scale options. The default Scale to fit page option makes sure that the dashboard 
fits on a single page. If you select the other option and scale the dashboard to a certain 
percentage, it might be using more than one page to be printed on. 

Chapter 6
153
Although the Print button will appear in the dashboard, it will not be shown 
on the printed result!
Grouping and organizing components with 
the canvas container
In the Grouping canvas components recipe in Chapter 1, Staying in Control, we discussed how 
grouping multiple components works. This solution is a good option when a limited number of 
components are involved. But if you are building a dashboard with a lot of overlapping layers, 
maybe even in combination with the dynamic visibility functionality, it is recommended to use 
the canvas container component.
Getting ready
No preparation required. Just open a new Dashboard Design file.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a canvas container component into the canvas.
2.	 Resize the canvas container component to almost half the same size of the canvas.
3.	 Drag a line chart component directly into the canvas container. 

Advanced Components
154
4.	 Have a look at the Object Browser. You will notice that the Line Chart component 
is placed one level below the Canvas Container component. This indicates that the 
Line Chart component is now part of the Canvas Container.
5.	 Select the Canvas Container and drag it to the far right of the canvas. As you will see, 
the Line Chart component also moves along with the Canvas Container. 
6.	 Now drag a Pie Chart component directly into the Canvas Container.
7.	
Resize the Canvas Container so that only one chart remains fully visible. A scroll bar 
will show up on the right side of the Canvas Container component. 
8.	 Preview the dashboard and check out how this looks in runtime!
How it works...
The canvas container component looks a lot like the grouping of multiple components as 
we have seen before in a recipe in Chapter 1, Staying in Control, called Grouping canvas 
components. But with this component, we also have the option to include horizontal or 
vertical scroll bars. In the properties pane, you can determine whether dashboard design 
has to show these scroll bars or not. By default, the Auto option is picked, which means that 
scroll bars are only shown if a component that is part of the canvas container component lies 
(partly) outside the canvas container. This happened in step 7 of this recipe.

Chapter 6
155
The gray background of the canvas container is only shown in the design mode. If you run the 
dashboard, only the possible scroll bars are visible. 
Using dashboard scenarios
If your dashboard has a typical 'what-if' scenario set up with a number of variables, it would 
be a nice option for the dashboard user to save a scenario with some particular settings to be 
reviewed or compared later. The local scenario button component delivers this functionality. 
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file. 
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a vertical slider component into the canvas.
2.	 Drag a local scenario button component into the canvas.
3.	 Hit the Preview button.
4.	 Set the slider to value 50. 

Advanced Components
156
5.	 Now click on the Scenario button. A menu with four new buttons will appear. Click on 
the Save button and name it Scenario 1.
6.	 Set the slider to value 75 and click on the Scenario button again. 
7.	
Click on the Load button and select the scenario you just saved. The value of the 
slider will now be set to value 50.
How it works...
The local scenario button enables the user of a dashboard to save the exact state a 
dashboard is in at that moment, including all the variables the user has set. These scenarios 
are saved locally, on the user's computer. This means that if you open the dashboard on 
another computer these saved scenarios cannot be loaded!
With the Delete button, the user can delete previously saved scenarios and with the Set 
Default button, a default scenario can be chosen, which will be loaded when the dashboard 
is opened. 
There is more...
If the dashboard user wants to return to the initial state of the dashboard, he/she of course 
can close the dashboard and reopen it. Using the reset button component for this task is 
a way better option. The Reset button does exactly what its name says—it resets the entire 
dashboard to its initial state after clicking on it. 

Chapter 6
157
Using the grid component
The grid component can display a table with data in your dashboard. Therefore it looks a 
bit like the list view and spreadsheet table components. There are a number of differences 
between these two sets of components, stated as follows:
The list view and spreadsheet table components allow us to make data selections; 
the grid component does not 
The grid component not only displays data, but its values can also be changed by the 
dashboard user 
The grid component doesn't have a header row 
The grid component has the option to make use of alerts 
Getting ready
Open a new dashboard design file and enter the values in the spreadsheet as shown in the 
following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a grid component into the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Data field to spreadsheet cells A5 until C7.
3.	 Go to the Behavior tab and set the Increment to 5.
4.	 Click on the Appearance tab. Set the Vertical Margin as well as the Horizontal 
Margin to 5.
5.	 Resize the canvas container component to almost half the same size of the canvas.
6.	 Preview the dashboard to see how this works. Move your mouse over one of the cells 
and click on it as soon the cursor changes into a small vertical spike with arrows on 
both ends. Now drag your cursor up or down to change the value of the cell.



Advanced Components
158
How it works...
As you have seen in the recipe the grid component works quite straightforward. It displays 
a simple table with the values in the spreadsheet cells we bound to the component and 
the value of each cell can be adjusted if we run the dashboard. As with all the insertion-like 
components, the actual value in the spreadsheet cell will change as well and can be used in 
Excel functions or other components that refer to this cell. 
There is more...
In the General tab, we are able to set the Minimum Limit and Maximum Limit that we can 
change a value to. This means that if the initial value of a cell lies outside this range and you 
want to change the value, you can only change it to a value within the range. 
Under the Common tab, these limits can be set to be Fixed or Open. If you choose the Open 
option, the Scale fields on the General tab are grayed out. 
Furthermore, you can set the Mouse Sensitivity level. This will set the speed in which the 
values will increase or decrease when changing them. If you set the Scroll Behavior to Auto, 
the values keep changing if you click the cell and drag the cursor a bit above or below the 
cell. If you use the Manual option instead, you have to keep moving your cursor up or down to 
change the value.

Creating a slide show
As we already discussed in Chapter 3 recipe Making selections from a custom image, you 
can use the image component to show pictures or Flash (.swf) files in your dashboard. This 
recipe will show how you can create slide shows of multiple images and/or SWF files with the 
slide show component.
Getting ready
For this recipe, we need some images and/or SWF files. Make sure that these are all files 
are of the following types—.jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, or .swf. The files can be on your 
local computer or on the Web. 

Advanced Components
160
How to do it...
1.	 Enter the URLs of the images or SWF files you want to show in the spreadsheet.
2.	 Drag a play selector component into the canvas. Set this component up to insert rows 
to destination cell A4, where the cells containing the URLs are the source data cells. 
For more information on this component, see recipe Using the Play Selector/Play 
Control in Chapter 3.
3.	 Now drag a slide show component into the canvas.
4.	 Bind the URL field to cell A4.
5.	 Switch to the Behavior tab and set the Transition Type to Wedge.
6.	 Preview the dashboard to see how the slide show looks. 
How it works...
The play selector does most of the work here actually. We need it to change the image that 
should be displayed by using data insertion. The slide show component only displays the 
images and provides a nice transition between two images. 

Chapter 6
161
There is more...
In the Appearance tab, there are some options that are specific for this component. First the 
Sizing Method, where you can set how the image or the SWF file should be displayed: In its 
original size, keeping its scale, or being stretched to the sizing of the component. Next there 
are settings for Horizontal and Vertical Alignment. Besides these options, the more standard 
Transparency option is also available. 
Using the panel set component
The panel set component is one of the few features of dashboard design that looks really 
cool at first, but which you probably won't use for your dashboard eventually. The purpose of 
this component is to create a showcase of images and/or Flash (.swf) files in one window. 
The user is able to zoom in on each panel. Unfortunately, the SWF files that are created with 
dashboard design are not supported and cannot be displayed, which instantly decreases the 
value of the component.
Getting ready
For this recipe, we need some images and/or SWF files. Make sure these are all files are of 
the following types—.jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, or .swf.

Advanced Components
162
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a panel set component into the canvas.
2.	 In the General tab of the Properties pane, select Layout2. 
3.	 Click on the Import button in the Content area and click on the Click to Add Images 
button in the upcoming window. Browse to your image or SWF file and click on Open. 
The file is now added to Panel 1. Repeat this step to add another file and close this 
window by clicking on OK.

4.	 Click on the button on the far right-hand side of the Drop-Down Menu Labels field. 
Enter a label for each file you just added.
5.	 Select Panel 2 and repeat the steps 3 and 4 to add some images and or SWF files to 
this second panel.
6.	 Now switch to the Behavior tab. In the Selected Item area, select Panel 1 and set 
the Item field to Image 1. Do the same for Panel 2.
7.	
Preview the dashboard.
8.	 Click on the maximize buttons.

9.	 Now click on the little arrow next to the maximize button to show the menu labels. 
Select a label to switch to another image or SWF file.
How it works...
As we saw in this recipe, the panel set component lets us display a set of panels to show 
multiple images and/or SWF files. There are even 27 different layouts to choose from with 
up to ten panels each.
The lack of support for dashboard design SWF files has already been mentioned but there are 
more problems with this component. First, it has no selector abilities. So even if you wanted to 
use this component to build a dashboard that functions as a product catalog, it is very hard to 
make it interactive and pass data through to other components. 
Another problem is performance-related. The more (high resolution) images you embed in this 
component, the bigger your final Dashboard Design dashboard SWF file will get. Big SWF files 
take longer to load and therefore decrease your dashboard's performance. So if you are using 
this component, make sure you test your final dashboard on different computer setups to 
check if the dashboard's performance is acceptable for the users.
There is more...
Linking to files instead of embedding
In the recipe, we embedded the images/SWFs in the panel set component. Another way to 
show these files is by using the By URL option for Content Type and linking to them using 
URLs. You can enter these URLs by putting them in the spreadsheet and binding to these 
cells. Or, add them as labels by clicking on the button on the far right-hand side. The 
Drop-Down Menu Labels can be entered in the same way.

Panel behavior
A nice option for this component is the Zoom Speed setting. Play around a bit with this slider 
to make the panel transition as smooth as you want it to be. Also, here you can enable/
disable the maximize button. 
Using the history component
The history component makes it possible to plot a value in a chart that changes in real time, 
while conserving its historical data. Okay, that may be a bit of a cryptic description of what this 
component does, but you should think about those stock charts that track the fluctuation of a 
stock price. At the start of the day, the line in such a chart is short, while at the end of the day 
the complete trend of the stock prize for that day is shown. This recipe will show you how to 
set up this kind of functionality in your dashboard.

Advanced Components
166
Getting ready
Just open a new Dashboard Design file.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a line chart component, a history component, and a horizontal slider component 
into the canvas.
2.	 Select the horizontal slider component and bind the Data field to spreadsheet 
cell B1.
3.	 Now select the history component and bind its Data field also to spreadsheet cell B1. 
4.	 Bind the Data Destination field to the spreadsheet range B3 to J3.
5.	 Go to the line chart component. Bind the Data By Range field to spreadsheet range 
B3 to J3.
6.	 Your setup should now look like the following screenshot:
7.	
Hit the Preview button and test the dashboard. Each time you move the slider, a new 
value should be plotted in the chart. 

Chapter 6
167
How it works...
The history component picks up a value from a certain source cell (cell B1 in this recipe) and 
pastes it in a horizontal or vertical range of cells that in fact stores the history of the value. 
These cells are bound to a chart and so a real-time changing graph is created. 
The history component has, besides the bindings to the source and destination cells, only one 
other setting. You can determine when a value should be pasted to the destination cells. This 
can be either when the data changes or on an interval of a certain number of seconds.  
This component works in the background and will therefore not be shown during runtime. 
There's more...
If you need more series of real time changing values in your chart, just use more history 
components to accomplish this!
Data insertion with the Source data 
component
The Source Data component enables us to insert data into spreadsheet cells by changing the 
selected index value of the component. This is a different approach to inserting data than we 
saw in Chapter 3 when we were discussing selectors and drill downs. 

Advanced Components
168
Getting ready
Open a new dashboard design file and enter the data into the spreadsheet as shown in the 
following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a pie chart component to the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Chart field to cell B3 and leave the Subtitle field empty.
3.	 Bind the Data Values field to the spreadsheet range from C3 to E3. Select the Data 
in Rows options.
4.	 Bind the Labels field to cells C5 to E5.
5.	 Drag a horizontal slider component to the canvas.
6.	 Bind the Data field to cell B1.
7.	
Set the Minimum Limit to 0 and the Maximum Limit to 3.
8.	 Now drag the source data component to the canvas.

Chapter 6
169
9.	 Select Insertion Type Row.
10.	 Bind the Source Data field to cell range B6 to E9.
11.	 Bind the Destination field to cells B3 to E3.
12.	Go to the Behavior tab. Bind the Selected Item Index field to cell B1.
13.	Preview the dashboard!

Advanced Components
170
How it works...
As already mentioned in the introduction of this recipe, the source data component has the 
same data insertion functionality as selector components and drilling down from charts. 
But, the data insertion of the source data component is triggered by a changing value in a 
spreadsheet cell and not directly by a user interacting with a component.  
In this recipe, we used a horizontal slider component to change a cell value (cell B1) to trigger 
the data insertion. But, you can of course also use this component in combination with Excel 
formulas, dynamic visibility, or the inserted data by other components. 
Analyzing trends
With the trend analyzer component dashboard design is able to calculate trends in a series 
of data. You can display these trends in a chart so you can view them next to the actual data 
and make your analysis. This component is also able to forecast future trends based on the 
actual data. 
Getting ready
For this recipe we need some data, so open a new Dashboard Design file and enter the values 
in the spreadsheet as shown in the following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a combination chart component into the canvas. 
2.	 Bind the data By Range to spreadsheet cells A5 through O7.
3.	 Drag a trend analyzer component into the canvas.
4.	 Bind the Data field to cells A6 through L6.
5.	 Select Trend/Regression Type Linear.
6.	 Bind the Analyzed Data Destination field to cells A7 through O7.
7.	
Set the Number of Forecast Periods to 3.

Chapter 6
171
8.	 Now preview the dashboard.
How it works...
In the previous example, we created a chart that shows a data series over a 12-month period. 
We selected the Linear trend type so the trend analyzer component calculates a linear trend 
based on the 12 values. Also, a forecast is calculated for the three months we don't have 
data on. The combination chart visualizes both the actual and the calculated trend data 
series, where the latter is a straight line. As the trend analyzer component is a background 
component, it won't be shown during runtime.

Advanced Components
172
Besides the option Linear for Trend/Regression Type, we can choose Logarithmic, 
Polynomial, Power, or Exponential. Also you can use the Best Fit option and trust 
Dashboard Design to pick the right one for us. 
There is more...
The properties pane of the trend analyzer component has a More Options section. Here 
you can bind information about the chosen trend/regression type to spreadsheet cells and 
display them in your dashboard. The fields you can show are the Equation Type Destination, 
the Equation Destination (that's the equation), the R2 Value Destination, and the 
F Value Destination.

Introduction
In this chapter, we will go through certain techniques on how you can utilize the different 
cosmetic features Dashboard Design provides, in order to improve the look of your dashboard.
Dashboard Design provides a powerful way to capture the audience versus other dashboard 
tools. It allows developers to build dashboards with the important 'wow' factor that other 
tools lack. Let's take, for example, two dashboards that have the exact same functionality, 
placement of charts, and others. However, one dashboard looks much more attractive than 
the other. In general, people looking at the nicer looking dashboard will be more interested 
and thus get more value of the data that comes out of it.

Thus, not only does Dashboard Design provide a powerful and flexible way of presenting data, 
but it also provides the 'wow' factor to capture a user's interest.
Changing the look of a chart
This recipe will run through changing the look of a chart. Particularly, it will go through each 
tab in the appearance icon of the chart properties. We will then make modifications and see 
the resulting changes.
Getting ready
Insert a chart object onto the canvas. Prepare some data and bind it to the chart.
How to do it...
1.	 Double-click/right-click on the chart object on the canvas/object properties window 
to go into Chart Properties. 
2.	 In the Layout tab, uncheck Show Chart Background.
3.	 In the Series tab, click on the colored square box circled in the next screenshot to 
change the color of the bar to your desired color. 
4.	 Then change the width of each bar; click on the Marker Size area and change 
it to 35. 

Chapter 7
175
5.	 Click on the colored boxes circled in red in the Axes tab and choose dark blue to 
modify the horizontal and vertical axes separately. 
6.	 Uncheck Show Minor Gridlines at the bottom so that we remove all the horizontal 
lines in between each of the major gridlines.

Dashboard Look and Feel
176
7.	
Next, go to the Text and Color tabs, where you can make changes to all the different 
text areas of the chart.
How it works...
As you can see, the default chart looks plain and the bars are skinny so it's harder to visualize 
things. It is a good idea to remove the chart background if there is an underlying background 
so that the chart blends in better. In addition, the changes to the chart colors and text provide 
additional aesthetics that help improve the look of the chart.

Adding a background to your dashboard
This recipe shows the usefulness of backgrounds in the dashboard. It will show how 
backgrounds can help provide additional depth to objects and help to group certain areas 
together for better visualization.
Getting ready
Make sure you have all your objects such as charts and selectors ready on the canvas. Here's 
an example of the two charts before the makeover. Bind some data to the charts if you want 
to change the coloring of the series.

Chapter 7
177
How to do it...
1.	 Choose Background4 from the Art and Backgrounds tab of the 
Components window. 
2.	 Stretch the background so that it fills the size of the canvas.
3.	 Make sure that ordering of the backgrounds is before the charts. To change the 
ordering of the background, go to the object browser, select the background object 
and then press the "-" key until the background object is behind the chart.

Dashboard Look and Feel
178
4.	 Select Background1 from the Art and Backgrounds tab and put two of them under 
the charts, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 When the backgrounds are in the proper place, open the properties window for the 
backgrounds and set the background color to your desired color. In this example we 
picked turquoise blue for each background.
How it works...
As you can see with the before and after pictures, having backgrounds can make a huge 
difference in terms of aesthetics. The objects are much more pleasant to look at now and 
there is certainly a lot of depth with the charts.
The best way to choose the right backgrounds that fit your dashboard is to play around with 
the different background objects and their colors. If you are not very artistic, you can come 
up with a bunch of examples and demonstrate it to the business user to see which one they 
prefer the most.
There's more...
It is important to use backgrounds carefully and not to use them in the wrong places. A good 
reference that we recommend is Information Dashboard Design by Stephen Few. Information 
Dashboard Design is a great book that will guide you on the best dashboard design practices 
and when to use backgrounds.

Chapter 7
179
Using color schemes
Dashboard Design conveniently has a set of built-in color themes that developers can use 
to instantly change the look of their dashboard. Using color themes helps provide consistent 
coloring among your objects and allows you to change the colors for multiple objects at a time 
without having to go into the properties of each object to make the necessary changes.
Getting ready
Have your set of objects that you want to change the colors for ready on the canvas. In this 
example we have the sales by region chart, a pie chart, and a set of underlying backgrounds 
that we want colors modified.
How to do it...
 1.	 Click on the colors icon and make sure that Current Theme Colors is selected. The 
backgrounds will be grey and the charts bluish.

Dashboard Look and Feel
180
2.	 Click on the colors icon and select the Concourse color scheme.
How it works...
As you can see, the default color scheme initially looked kind of bland and the coloring for 
each series in the pie chart is very similar, making it tough to decipher between each of the 
series. Changing it to the Concourse color scheme lightens up the background considerably 
with a light bluish background which is easy on the eyes. In addition, the series on the pie 
chart are more easily distinguishable; however the blues in our opinion are still too similar. 
We can fix that by modifying the color scheme, which will be explained in the next recipe.
There's more...
Using a good coloring scheme requires a lot of trial and error and there are many best 
practices that need to be accounted for. For example, different series on a chart should 
be colored differently so that users don't have to spend a lot of time figuring out which bar 
belongs to which series. 
We also want colors that are soothing for the eyes. Colors that are too bright or too dark may 
cause strain to the eyes, thus making it more difficult to find information.

Chapter 7
181
When going through color schemes, it is best to demo to the end users who will be using the 
dashboard and go with a coloring scheme that is most comfortable to their eyes, as it will 
allow them to find information more easily.
Sharing a color scheme
Developers may want to customize a dashboard's charts and objects to follow a company's 
coloring guidelines. Most likely, the company's coloring guidelines will not match any of the 
built-in coloring schemes, so we'll need a way to create a coloring scheme that we can re-use 
every time a new dashboard is built for the same company.
Getting ready
You must be able to view hidden files and folders in the c:\Documents and Settings\
your_user_id folder. If you are a Windows Vista or Windows 7 user, you will need to be able 
to view hidden files and folders in c:\Users\your_user_id.
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the colors icon and select the Create New Color Scheme at the bottom of 
the list.

Dashboard Look and Feel
182
2.	 Change the background color to whatever color you want by clicking on the 
colored square.
3.	 Click on the Charts tab and change the Series color to something other than the 
default color.

Chapter 7
183
4.	 Click the Save button when you are finished.
5.	 Your color scheme has now been saved and you can now transfer it to other 
computers. Copy the XML files of the theme that you want to share from the 
following two folders to the exact same directory in the destination computer. The 
XML filenames will have the same names as the files that you saved at the following 
location: c:\Documents and Settings\your_user_id\Application Data\
XcelsiuscustomThemes and c:\Documents and Settings\your_user_id\
Application Data\XcelsiuscustomThemesAutoInfo.
6.	 For Windows Vista and Windows 7, the directory path before Xcelsius will be: 
c:\Users\your_user_id\AppData\Roaming\.

Dashboard Look and Feel
184
How it works...
Every time you save a custom coloring scheme, it will create two XML files in the directories 
mentioned earlier. From there, you can easily share the coloring scheme with other developers 
or other machines that have Dashboard Design installed.
As you can see, once you have the coloring scheme XML files in place, you will be able to 
select them from the Color Scheme Toolbar.
Working with themes
Dashboard Design 2008 has a library of themes that developers can use to change the 
chart and object styles to the look that suits them most. The ability to select different themes 
is important because it gives developers more options on customizing the look of their 
dashboards to what fits best. There are eight themes that developers may choose from. 
In this recipe, we will be showcasing the default theme and two other themes.

Chapter 7
185
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the Themes icon and by default, you will see that Aqua is selected.
2.	 Change the theme to Aero.

Dashboard Look and Feel
186
3.	 Change the theme to Halo.
How it works...
As you can see, Dashboard Design provides a large library of themes allowing you to 
customize the style of your backgrounds, objects, and charts. For example, some themes 
may have more gradient backgrounds and charts such as the Aero theme, whereas the Halo 
theme has a flat but bold look.
Making component colors dynamic
Dashboard Design 2008 allows users to fully control the coloring of their components 
based on whatever event they desire. For example, if a major alert were to happen I could 
dynamically change my background to red in order to signal an emergency. This is extremely 
useful because developers can not only dynamically control the color of bars on a chart but 
also the rest of the chart components such as the background and text as well.
How to do it...
1.	 On the cell highlighted in yellow E2, we have a COUNTIF statement that will set 
the bar color to red, if any of the regions has their number of items sold below 40. 
Otherwise the bar color will be set to blue as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
187
2.	 On the chart properties go to the Color tab and click on the square colored box in the 
fill column. On the bottom of the color palette, choose the Bind to Color option and 
bind to the cell with the color control (E2, in our case).

Dashboard Look and Feel
188
3.	 Go to the Text tab of the chart properties and click on the color square of the Chart 
Title. Bind the color to the cell that controls the title text color (in our case, E3).
4.	 Change the cell from B2 to B5 to a value below 40 and verify that the Bar color and 
Title color are functioning correctly.

Chapter 7
189
How it works...
In our example, we can easily control the coloring of our chart components with the help 
of some Excel formulas. Using this method, we are able to clearly alert users if something 
significant has occurred. For example, if it was critical that all of the regions surpass a 
particular threshold (40), we can send out a clear alert signal (title and bars red), if one 
of the regions fails.

Dashboard Look and Feel
190
There's more...
Because the dynamic coloring depends on Boolean logic, you'll need the aid of Excel formulas 
to determine which color is displayed. We recommend that you become familiar with Excel 
Boolean logic to fully utilize the functionality of dynamic coloring.
Using the panel container
The panel container component is useful if a designer thinks that a set of item(s) is too large 
for the canvas and wants to be able to scroll the inside of the canvas. A good example would 
be a scrolling set of charts. Let's say real estate on the dashboard was an issue and we had 
many charts that needed to be shown but it was not mandatory to show all charts on one 
view. If we put it in a panel container, we can scroll through each chart kind of like a 
slide show.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Panel Container from the Containers tab.
2.	 Insert a set of charts (these can be any type of charts that you wish to insert) inside 
the panel container.

Chapter 7
191
3.	 Shrink the panel container so that it doesn't take up too much real estate on the 
dashboard. You can do this by hovering your mouse to the edge of the panel and 
resizing from there.
How it works...
In our example, we were able to emulate a slideshow of charts. This is useful if the charts 
do not need to be visible in one screen all together and will allow designers to save on 
real estate.

Dashboard Look and Feel
192
There's more...
If you are putting multiple objects in a panel container you must make sure that the business 
is okay with the scrolling. In the majority of cases, it is best practice to have everything show 
up on the same screen without having to scroll. However in some cases such as a large table 
that may contain large report type information, we may have to resort to using the panel 
container in order to facilitate the best use of real estate.
Using the tab set container
The best analogy to a tab set would be the tabs that you see in Internet Explorer and Firefox. 
Before the advent of tabs, we would have multiple windows of Internet Explorers open, which 
was very cumbersome. With tabs we are able to flip through the different pages that you 
have opened very easily. Before Xcelsius 2008, developers who wanted to work with multiple 
pages on one dashboard needed to do a lot of work with dynamic visibility. With the tab set 
container, we are able to separate different pages within the dashboard very easily. This 
allows us to flip through pages that are independent of each other but related to the same 
topic without having to reload separate dashboards or set dynamic visibility for each page.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Tab Set Container from the Containers tab.
2.	 In the Properties window of the canvas, you can rename the tab. In our example we 
named the first tab as Sales.

Chapter 7
193
3.	 To add a new tab, press the + button on the top left-hand side of the canvas. It will 
then pop up a window that lets you name your tab. In our example, we named the 
second tab Trend Analysis, as seen in the following screenshot:
4.	 The different tabs will be separated as different canvases on the object browser 
window. All components residing in each canvas will be as a child of the canvas on 
the object browser window.
How it works...
The tab set container is basically a set of canvas containers that hold your objects. The set 
of canvas containers are distinguished by the tab at the top of the main container. Users are 
able to switch through tabs at run time very easily. This emulates the tabs found on popular 
browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox.

Dashboard Look and Feel
194
There's more...
When building tab containers, designers should be careful of having too many tabs or too 
many levels of tab hierarchies. It is recommended to keep the number of tabs in each level to 
a maximum of five.
For example, look at the following screenshot. If we have nine tabs, we can see that the 
dashboard starts becoming overwhelming and complex. It is also good to keep the number of 
hierarchies to a maximum of two. Again, we can see once we get past two hierarchies, it starts 
to become messy and users will have too many paths to choose from.
Finally, each additional tab means an additional page. With each additional page comes a 
set of components and charts which equate to a larger footprint. Dashboards with a larger 
footprint will take longer to load due to the size of the SWF file and performance will take a 
hit due to the number of objects.
Making tables look pretty
With Dashboard Design 2008, we are able to create tables that look just like a table in an 
Excel spreadsheet. Unfortunately, our everyday tables look quite bland. If we start off with a 
default spreadsheet table, it will look kind of like this:

Chapter 7
195
It looks okay, but with the help of some Dashboard Design objects, we can spice it up to look 
much more attractive.
Getting ready
Prepare the data on your Excel spreadsheet and set up a table like in the previous image.
How to do it...
1.	 Change the theme to Aero.
2.	 Select the first Background object from the Art and Backgrounds tab from the 
Category window.
3.	 Place the background so that it is under the table.

Dashboard Look and Feel
196
4.	 Select the Rectangle object from the Art and Backgrounds tab and place it under 
the body of the table to give it a background color.
5.	 Select the Rectangle object from the Art and Backgrounds tab and place it on 
top of the header and give it a linearly gradient background color. This will be the 
background for the table title.
6.	 Select Label from the Text tab of the Category window. Center it on the title 
background to give the table a title.
How it works...
As you can see, with the help of a few Dashboard Design components such as backgrounds, 
rectangles, and labels, we are able to spice up the look of a table and make it much more 
pleasing to the eye.

Smart use of quadrants
It is very important when designing a dashboard to make it as easy to read as possible. In 
addition, we want to make a dashboard conform to how humans analyze a picture. A common 
concept is to move from the top left-hand side to the top right-hand side and then to the 
bottom. This is a flow that the majority of users are comfortable with.

Chapter 7
197
Now we bring in the concept of quadrants. It allows us to create groupings so that a user is not 
so overwhelmed when looking at the dashboard. Creating proper quadrants is very important 
and this recipe will give an example of the proper use of quadrants. 
Getting ready
Gather the desired charts and selectors on your dashboard.
How to do it...
1.	 Set up your charts in a way where it is like four quadrants.
2.	 Selectors should be on the top left-hand side, if they control the whole chart.
3.	 Use backgrounds to help separate your quadrants.
4.	 Parent charts should be on the left-hand side or on top of the drill-down chart
5.	 Charts that we want users to look at first should be at the top.
6.	 If possible, size all the quadrants equally.
7.	
Align the components neatly so that it is easier on the eyes when looking for 
different items.

Dashboard Look and Feel
198
How it works...
As you can see, when we group things into four quadrants, it is very easy to read the 
dashboard. In addition, we are comfortable with navigation, as we start at the top left-hand 
side. The drilldown is easy to understand and navigate as we have the parent chart on the 
left-hand side of the drilldown chart. Secondary information such as extra details should be 
on the bottom of the chart and not at the top, as users are interested in the highest level data 
first, when coming into a dashboard. Finally, it is very important to align everything neatly and 
size everything as equally as possible. This makes the dashboard much easier to read.
Now let's take an example—seen in the next screenshot—of a dashboard that is not set in 
quadrants and aligned neatly:
This dashboard is harder to read and navigate now, as things are not in quadrants. The 
drop-down selectors are on the bottom right-hand side, so we have to shift our eyes to the 
main parent chart diagonally whenever we make a change which is not very user friendly.

Introduction
Dashboards get really powerful when they are able to display recent or even real-time data. 
Of course, you can manually enter the updated data in the Dashboard Design spreadsheet 
and publish a new dashboard every time the data changes. If your dashboard uses a lot 
of data that changes regularly, you will quickly find out that this is going to be a very time 
consuming task. 
A good solution is to set up up one or more data connections between the dashboard and 
an external data source. If the data in the source changes, the dashboard will show this 
updated information.

Creating a news ticker with Excel XML Maps
In this recipe, we will show you how to integrate a real-time news ticker into your 
dashboard. To set up this connection to an online news website, we will use the 
Excel XML Maps connection.
Getting ready
Make sure the spreadsheet area has a Developer tab, if you are using MS Excel 2007. If 
you do not see this tab, skip to the There is more... section of this recipe to set this up. 
Furthermore, you need a connection to the Internet. 
How to do it...
1.	 Go to http://www.cnn.com/. At the bottom of this site, you will see an RSS link. 
You can also go directly to http://www.cnn.com/services/rss/.
2.	 Co������������������
py the URL of the Top Stories RSS feed http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_
topstories.rss.
RSS is an XML-based method by which the web content can 
be easily and quickly distributed, when it is changed or newly 
entered into a website.
3.	 Open a new Dashboard Design file, go to the Developer tab, and click on Source. The 
XML Source pane now appears.
If you are using MS Excel 2003, you can find the XML Source 
pane in the Data menu | XML | XML Source.

message stating that this XML source does not refer to a schema and Excel will 
create one. Click on OK. 
7.	
Click on OK once more in the XML Maps window to close it. The XML Source window 
now shows all the fields that are available in this RSS stream. 
8.	 To create a news ticker we only need two of these fields—the title of the article and 
the URL to the article on the CNN website. Both the fields are located in the item 
folder—title and link. Click and drag the title field to cell A6 and drag the link field 
to cell B6.

9.	 Hit the Refresh Data button in the Developer tab. The cells below A6 and B6 will now 
be filled with data from the RSS feed. 
10.	 Open the Data Manager.
11.	 Click on the Add button and select Excel XML Maps. You can find this connection 
type in the Existing Connections area.
12.	As you can see in the following screenshot, the Data Manager already picked up the

How it works...
Let's recap what we just did. First we added a RSS feed from CNN.com to our spreadsheet. We 
used the standard Excel XML Maps �������������������������������������������������������������
 ������������������������������������������������������������
functionality to do this. A big advantage of this method is 
that we can preview the data directly in the spreadsheet, which makes setting up components 
and data bindings easy.� 
Next, we created a data connection in the� Data Manager. This step is necessary to let 
Dashboard Design know where to get the data from and under what conditions (refresh rate). 
If we do not do this, the dashboard will not get fresh data from the RSS feed and will only use 
the data that is already stored in the spreadsheet cells.
We bound a �������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Ticker �������������������������������������������������������������������������������
 ������������������������������������������������������������������������������
component to the cells containing the titles of the news stories. If the user 
clicks on one of the titles a webpage should open with the right story. We set up row insertion 
to fetch the right URL for the ����������������������������������������������������������������
 ���������������������������������������������������������������
URL Button�����������������������������������������������������
. ���������������������������������������������������
Finally, we configured the �������������������������

component so 
it would be triggered without clicking on it.

Adding the Developer tab
To create a XML Maps connection in MS Excel 2007, you need the Developer tab. 
Unfortunately, this tab is not activated by default. Follow the next steps to add it:
1.	 Close Dashboard Design.
2.	 Open MS Excel.
3.	 Click on the Office button in the upper left-hand side of the window and click on the 
Excel Options button.
4.	 Now select Show Developer tab in the Ribbon in the Popular section and click 
on OK.
5.	 Close MS Excel and open Dashboard Design again. The Developer tab is now 
available in the spreadsheet area.

Chapter 8
205
Usage tab
Most connection types in the Data Manager have a Usage tab, as we saw in step 14 of the 
recipe. There are two sections in this tab—Refresh Options and Load Status.
With Refresh Before Components Are Loaded the data connection will be used to get data 
as soon the dashboard starts. The Refresh Every option sets the refresh rate in seconds, 
minutes or hours. You can also choose to refresh the data when a value in a spreadsheet cell 
changes or a certain value is matched. 
During the loading of fresh data it is possible to inform the dashboard user what is happening 
at the moment (loading data or idle). You can insert these messages in a spreadsheet cell 
and display them for example with a Label component. Also, a nice idea is to display a 
loading-image instead of text. You can use Dynamic Visibility to set this up (see Chapter 4).
If you select the Enable Load Cursor option, the cursor will change from the standard arrow 
into an hourglass. The Disable Mouse Input on Load option will disable user interactions 
(mouse clicks and mouse overs) as long as data is being loaded.

Dashboard Connectivity
206
Connection Refresh button
To manually refresh data when using the dashboard, we can use the Connection Refresh 
Button component. This component can refresh one or more connections that are defined in 
the Data Manager.
Using Query as a WebService (QaaWS)
Query as aWebService (QaaWS) is a small but powerful tool in the SAP BusinessObjects 
Enterprise portfolio that allows us to create a query on top of a SAP BusinessObjects Universe 
and publish its results as a Web Service. This recipe shows you how to create such a QaaWS 
and how to consume the data in Dashboard Design.
Getting ready
First you need a SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise installation (with server and client 
components installed). Also, you need a Universe that is connected to an underlying database.
How to do it...
1.	 Open Query As A Web Service and log on to your SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise 
server. You can find this application in the BusinessObjects Enterprise Client 
Tools folder. 
2.	 Click the New Query button in the upper left. Here you can enter a name for this web 
service and a description (not mandatory). Enter a name for your web service and 
click on the Next button.
3.	 In this screen, we select the Universe we want to use. Select a Universe name and 
click on Next.

Chapter 8
207
4.	 The next screen looks like the query panel of a web intelligence document. In the left-
hand side column of this screen the available dimensions, measures, and filters from 
the selected Universe are displayed. Drag the ones you want to use into the Result 
Objects area and click on Next. 
5.	 If the Answer prompts screen pops up, just click on the OK button. The There is 
more... section of this recipe will discuss the use of prompts.

Dashboard Connectivity
208
6.	 The Preview screen is shown, which provides us with an overview of the QaaWS 
setup we just created. Most important here is the Preview part that shows how 
the data and its layout will look like in Dashboard Design after setting up the data 
connection and binding the columns to the spreadsheet. Click on Publish.
7.	
Now click on the To Clipboard button to copy the web service URL to your clipboard.
8.	 Open Dashboard Design and go to the Data Manager.
9.	 Add a Query as a Web Service connection. 
10.	 Paste the URL into the WSDL URL field and click on Import.

Chapter 8
209
11.	 Select the row folder in the Output Values section. As we have three columns of data 
in this Web Service, we have to bind it to a three-column area in the spreadsheet. 
Bind it to cells A6 until C30. 
12.	Go to the Usage tab and select Refresh Before Components Are Loaded. Close the 
Data Manager.
13.	To see if and how the data is fetched by Dashboard Design from the web service, add 
a Spreadsheet Table component to the canvas and bind it to cells A6 until C30.
14.	 Preview the dashboard. A User Identification popup will appear. Enter your SAP 
BusinessObjects Enterprise credentials to log in. The Spreadsheet component will 
now be filled with data from the web service.
How it works...
In this recipe, we used three stages to get data into our dashboard. First was the SAP 
BusinessObjectsUniverse, second was the QaaWS definition on top of the Universe that 
created a web service, and third was the QaaWS connection set up in the Dashboard 
Design Data Manager to connect to this web service. 
As we cannot preview the data in the Dashboard Design spreadsheet like we did in the 
Creating a news ticker with Excel XML Maps recipe, we used the Spreadsheet component 
to check how the cells are populated when running the dashboard.

Using prompts
QaaWS prompts make it possible to load only the data that the dashboard user needs when 
using the dashboard.
1.	 Repeat steps 1 to 4 of the recipe. Before clicking on Next in the fourth step, add the 
dimension that you want to make a selection on into the Filter Objects area. Select 
the Prompt option by clicking on the little arrow on the right-hand side.
2.	 The Answer prompts window appears. Here, you have to select one of the available 
values to enable QaaWS to create a preview of the data in the next screen. Select a 
value and click on OK.

Chapter 8
211
3.	 As you can see in the following screenshot, the prompt filter object we added is now 
shown as Input Parameter. Publish the QaaWS.
4.	 Repeat steps 8 through 11 of the recipe.
5.	 The prompt is now displayed in the Input Values area. Bind the prompt to cell A1. 
6.	 Go to the Usage tab and bind the Trigger Cell field to cell A1. Now the data will only 
be refreshed when the value in this cell changes. Close the Data Manager.

Dashboard Connectivity
212
7.	
Set up a Spreadsheet component, like we did in step 13 of the recipe.
8.	 Add a Combo Box component and add the Labels for the prompt. Use Insertion 
TypeLabel and bind the Destination field to cell A1.
9.	 Preview the dashboard and switch between the different labels to see the different 
data selections being loaded into the dashboard.
Methods
As you might have noticed while creating a QaaWS connection in Dashboard Design, there 
are several different methods you can use in the Definition tab. These methods can be split 
into two groups—to retrieve data and to list available parameter values. The methods are 
discussed here:
runQueryAsAService: This is the default selected option that we used for the 
examples in this recipe as well. It enables us to send out parameter values and 
retrieve data.
runQueryAsAServiceEx: This method gives the same output results as 
runQueryAsAService, but instead of providing an exact input parameter 
value, we can now also give its index.
valuesOf_parameter: This method will return a list of values for its input 
parameter, which can be used to create a selector like we did in the Using 
prompts section.
Remember that each QaaWS connection can only use a single method, so you might have to 
set up more than one connection.

Using Live Office connection
With SAP BusinessObjects Live Office it is possible to insert data from Crystal Reports and 
Web Intelligence reports into the Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint). 
As the data can also be refreshed with this add-on, the Live Office Connection can be a very 
useful way to provide our dashboards with fresh data. 
Getting ready
For this recipe, you need a SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise installation and the Live Office 
Connection software installed on your client computer. You need a Crystal Report, Web 
Intelligence report, or Universe (to connect to) as well. 
How to do it...
1.	 Open a new Dashboard Design file and go to the Preferences in the File menu. In the 
Excel Options section, check if Live Office Compatibility is enabled.
2.	 Go to the Live Office tab of the spreadsheet. Click on the Crystal Reports or Web 
Intelligence button to insert a report. 

Dashboard Connectivity
214
3.	 Log on to your SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise environment and choose a report.
4.	 If your report contains any parameters, a window will appear in which you can enter 
the parameter values to filter the data set that should be retrieved. In the There is 
more... section of this recipe, we will discuss how to connect these prompts to 
the dashboard.
5.	 In the next window, the actual Crystal Reports or Web Intelligence report is shown. 
With some mouse dragging and selecting, you can select the data you want to import.

6.	 �������������
Click on the Switch to Fields button to see an overview of all available fields is 
shown. Here, you can also select which fields you want to use.

If you want to set some more filters on fields, you can use the window shown in the 
following screenshot: 

Dashboard Connectivity
216
8.	 In the final window, you can enter a name for the Live Office Objects you just set up. 
Click on Finish. 
9.	 As you will notice, the spreadsheet is now populated with data from the report.
10.	 Go to the Data Manager and add a Live Office Connections connection. Change the 
Sessions URL in the correct URL to your SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise server. The 
Ranges are already bound to the cells in which the data has been imported. As you 
can see the Headers and Data Grid are separated. Do not forget to set up the Usage 
tab (see the recipe Creating a news ticker with Excel XML Maps).

Chapter 8
217
How it works...
With the Live Office Connection, we retrieve data from Crystal Reports, Web Intelligence 
reports, or connect directly to a Universe. The main advantage of this type of connection 
over QaaWS is that with Live Office we are able to use data from scheduled Crystal Reports 
or Web Intelligence reports, instead of querying the database every time we want to use the 
dashboard. In an environment with a large user base and large data sets, this can be an 
important factor. Another advantage of Live Office over QaaWs is that we get the benefits of 
Web Intelligence or Crystal Report such as using Crosstabs, formatting, and layout control. 
Also, just like the Excel XML Maps connection method with Live Office, we can load actual 
data into the spreadsheet during the design of the dashboard, which eases the development.
There is more...
Using prompts
Just like we have seen in the Using Query as a Web Service (QaaWS) recipe, it is possible to 
use prompts to select the data that we want to retrieve and use in our dashboard with the Live 
Office Connection. Use the following steps to set this up:
1.	 In the Live Office tab of the spreadsheet, select the Modify Object button and 
choose Prompt Setting....
2.	 In the window that appears, you will see the available parameters. After selecting the 
parameter you want to use, select Choose Excel data range.
3.	 Bind the field to a spreadsheet cell. 

Dashboard Connectivity
218
4.	 Now you follow steps 6 through 9 of the There is more... section on Using Prompts of 
the Using Query as a Web Service (QaaWS) recipe to use these prompts from within 
your dashboard.
Connecting to SAP BW
The introduction of a direct connection between Dashboard Design and SAP BW over BI 
Consumer Services (BICS) meant a big step forward for Dashboard Design development. 
With this connectivity option the detour via QAAWS or Live Office is not necessary anymore to 
get data into dashboards from a SAP BW system.
Getting ready
To set up a connection between Dashboard Design and SAP BW you have to make sure that 
your installation fulfils the following technical requirements:
SAP BW 7.01, service pack 05 with ABAP and Java stacks deployed
SAP BusinessObjectsXcelsius Enterprise 2008 Service Pack 02
SAP Frontend 7.x installed at client with BI Add-Ons
For this recipe, we are using a simple BEx Query to connect to.�

219
How to do it...
1.	 Open a new Dashboard Design file and open the Data Manager. Add a new SAP 
NetWeaver BW Connection.
2.	 Click on the Browse button to log in to the SAP BW system. Select the correct SAP BW 
system, enter your login credentials, and click on OK.
3.	 Use the Find option to search for your query. Click on Open to select the query.
4.	 Go to the Data Preview tab and click on the Refresh Data Preview button. A preview 
of the layout of the returned data will now be shown here. In our example, there are 
seven columns shown—four characteristics and three key figures.

Dashboard Connectivity
220
The Data Preview tab has the option to rearrange the layout of 
the output of the BEx Query and add/remove characteristics by 
using drag-and-drop.
5.	 Go back to the Definition tab. 
6.	 Select Cross-Tab Data from the Output Values section and bind it to the 
spreadsheet. For each column in the Data Preview tab (step 4) you need a 
column in the spreadsheet.
7.	
Go to the Usage tab and select the Refresh Before Components Are Loaded option. 
Close the Data Manager.
8.	 Add a Spreadsheet component to the canvas and bind it to the same cell range as 
you bound to in step 6.
9.	 If you hit the Preview button, a message will appear stating that it is not possible to 
preview this dashboard with BI Query connection data. If you hit Yes, the dashboard 
will be previewed without live data from SAP BW.
10.	 Click on No. The recipe Publishing to SAP BW in Chapter 9 covers the Launch 
function to deploy the dashboard with an active connection to SAP BW.

Chapter 8
221
How it works...
The SAP NetWeaver BW Connection enables us to retrieve data from a SAP BW system via 
a BEx Query. For this example, we used a simple BEx Query we created in the BEx Query 
Designer with four characteristics in the rows and three key figures in the columns. In the 
properties settings for the characteristics, we defined the Results Rows as Always Suppress 
so the output won't include this row.
If we run this BEx Query, the result would be as in the following image. The first row shows the 
headers for the three key figures. In the second row, the headers for the four characteristics 
are shown. In this row as well, the Unit information for the key figures placed (EUR) is placed 
when available. 

Dashboard Connectivity
222
Running the original BEx Query is a great way to get an overview of 
how the data output will eventually look for setting up the spreadsheet. 
Especially, if you are using multiple characteristics and key figures this 
will give you a view that is much clearer than the Data Preview tab in 
the Data Manager.
There is more...
Using variables and filters
Just as we have seen how to use prompts in the Using Query as a Web Service (QaaWS) 
recipe, we can use BEx Query variables and filters to fetch a limited set of data. 
1.	 Go to the Data Manager.
2.	 In the Output Values area search for Variables and select Value Help for the variable 
you want to use. 
3.	 Bind Current Filter Value (Key) to a range of cells. In these cells the values you can 
choose from will be inserted.
4.	 In the Input Values area, select the variable and bind it to a cell. This cell should 
contain the value that the BEx Query uses as input for the variable.
5.	 Now add a selector component to the canvas. 
6.	 Bind its Labels field to the cell range you bound to in step 3.
7.	
Set the Insertion Type to Label and bind the Destination field to same cell as you 
bound to in step 4.
The procedure for filters is the same as for variables. The only difference is that in the Output 
Values area you need to select the Characteristics instead of the Variables elements.

Chapter 8
223
If you are using a BEx Query variable that represents a data interval, 
the value that you use as input for this variable should have the 
following format: StartValue - EndValue, (a space before and 
after the minus). You can use the Excel Concatenate function to 
combine the output of two selectors in a single cell and bind this cell 
to the variable in the Input Values area.
Other Output Values
The Output Values area includes the following elements:
Cross-Tab Data: Provides the complete query output
Characteristics: Provides fields to create a list of values
Variables: Also provides fields to create a list of values
Static Filter: Gives information about the filters that already have been created in the 
BEx Query
Information: Provides information about the BEx Query, such as the Query Technical 
Name or the Last Data Update
Messages: Provides BEx Query error messages
Returned data format
The SAP NetWeaver BW connection gives us the option to let the data return as Raw or 
Formatted. By default, the Raw option is selected. If you choose Formatted, the BExformat 
will be used, which means that the data includes information such as the number of decimals 
and currency.

Using Universe queries	
The Universe query feature differs from the other data connection methods in that we can 
create a query from a Universe without leaving Dashboard Design and that we are able to bind 
the result data not only to the spreadsheet, but also directly to the components on the canvas.
Getting ready
Open a new Dashboard Design file and activate the Query Browser ��������������
pane from the� View ������
menu. 
You also need an SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise environment with a Universe you want to 
connect to.
Unfortunately, only .unx Universes are supported. You can use the 
Information Design Tool to convert .unv Universes to .unx.
How to do it...
1.	 Go to the Query Browser and click on the Add Query button.
2.	 If you are not already connected to the SAP BusinessObjects Environment a pop up 
will appear asking you to log in. Enter the system and user credentials to log in.
3.	 A list with available Universes appears. Select the Universe you want to use and click 
on Next.
4.	 In the Build Query screen you can define the Universe query. Drag a dimension and a 
measure to the Results Objects section.
5.	 Drag a dimension you want to filter onto the Filter Objects area.

Chapter 8

Click on the Next button to go to the PreviewQuery Results screen.
8.	 As we added a prompt, we now need to select a value to fill this prompt to retrieve 
some preview data. Select a value from the list and click on Run.
9.	 The result of the query will be shown now. Click on Next.

10.	 The final screen is the Usage Options screen, which looks exactly the same as the 
Usage tab in the Data Manager. Click on OK.
11.	 The query has been added to the Query Browser pane, including the Result Objects, 
Filters, and Prompts you selected.
12.	Bind each dimension and measure of the Result Objects area to a column in the 
spreadsheet. 
13.	Add a Spreadsheet Table component to the canvas. Bind its Display Data field to the 
cells you bound the dimensions and measures to in the previous step.
14.	 Now add a List Box component to the canvas. Click on the button to the right-hand 
side of the Labels field and select Query Data.

Destination field and again select Query Data. Now select the prompt we created in 
step 6 and click on OK.
17.	 Preview the dashboard!

Dashboard Connectivity
228
How it works...
The Universe query feature gives us the opportunity to connect a dashboard to a Universe 
without leaving Dashboard Design to set up QaaWS or Live Office and without using 
the spreadsheet in Dashboard Design, as we can bind the query results directly to the 
components.
In the recipe, we set up a List Box component with this Universe query feature by retrieving 
the Label values directly from the Universe. The selected label was used as input for the query 
prompt we created earlier while setting up the Universe query.
From the Query Browser, we inserted the output of the query into the spreadsheet, from 
which we used the data to be displayed in a Spreadsheet Table component. Of course you 
can also add for example a chart component and use the Query Data option to connect to the 
result data, just like we did with the labels for the List Box component.
There is more...
Query Prompt Selector
With the Query Prompt Selector component we are able to use prompts that we defined in the 
query, again, without using the spreadsheet. From the Query Browser you can select and drag 
the prompt onto the canvas to add such a Query Prompt Selector component. You can also 
find this component in the Components list.
In the General tab of the properties pane of this component, you can define whether you want 
the query to be refreshed after the selection has been made or after clicking on the button. 
Here, you can also change the Button Label.

Chapter 8
229
The following screenshot shows this component:
Query Refresh button
With the Query Refresh button component you are able to manually refresh the query. After 
adding this component to the canvas you need to select the Universe queries that should be 
refreshed after clicking on the button. 
Passing values from dashboard to 
dashboard with Flash Variables
As we have seen in Chapter 6, recipe Creating a slide show we can show .swf files inside 
a dashboard. If you load a Dashboard Design .swf file into another Dashboard Design 
dashboard, a big drawback is that it seems impossible to let them have some kind of 
interaction. Both dashboards of course have their own separated spreadsheet logic. 
In this recipe, we will show you how to workaround this problem and pass values from one 
dashboard to another using Flash Variables.
Getting ready
No preparations are needed for this recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag an Input Text component and a SWF Loader component to the canvas.
2.	 Go to the spreadsheet and enter in cell A1: Company A. This is the default value that 
will be passed to the second dashboard.
3.	 Type the following in cell A2: child.swf?Variable1=.
Type the following in cell A3: =CONCATENATE(A2,A1).
4.	 Link the Input Text component to cell A1. Also, make sure you select the Insert Data 
On Load option and bind its Destination field to cell A1.

Dashboard Connectivity
230
5.	 Bind the Source URL field of the SWF Loader component to cell C3.
6.	 Save and export this dashboard to an .swf file. See the Chapter 10 recipe, Exporting 
a Standard SWF for more information. Name this .swf file parent.swf.
7.	
Open a new Dashboard Design file and drag a Label component to the canvas.
8.	 Now bind this Label component to cell A1. 
9.	 Define this cell as Named Range Variable1. See Chapter 1 recipe Using Named 
Ranges for more information on how to do this.
10.	 Decrease the size of the canvas by clicking on the Fit Canvas To Components option 
in the Standard Toolbar. You can also find these options in the View menu.

Chapter 8
231
11.	 The following is the screenshot of canvas that is decreased in size:
12.	Now go to the Data Manager and add a Flash Variables connection.
13.	Click on the Import Named Ranges button. The named range you just created will 
pop up in the Ranges window. You can now close the Data Manager.

Dashboard Connectivity
232
14.	 Save and export the dashboard to an SWF file. Make sure the name of this SWF file is 
child.swf.
15.	Open parent.swf. Change Company A into another value, click outside the text 
input box, or hit the Enter key and see what happens.
How it works...
We just created two dashboards: a parent and a child dashboard, where the child dashboard 
is loaded in the parent dashboard with the SWF Loader component. The source URL in this 
SWF Loader component not only pointed to the location of the child dashboard (child.
swf), but also contained a variable with a value (?Variable1=CompanyA). With the Flash 
Variables data connection the child dashboard is able to read the value data for this variable 
and put it in a spreadsheet cell during runtime.
We used the Excel Concatenate formula so each time the variable value changes a 
new URL is created. The SWF Loader reloads the child dashboard after each time the 
Source URL changes.
There is more...
Using multiple variables
Using more than one variable is easy. Just repeat the steps of this recipe and make sure you 
separate the variables with an ampersand (&). An example URL with two variables would look 
like this: child.swf?Variable1=Value1&Variable=Value2.

Chapter 8
233
Passing multiple values
Besides using more than one variable it is also possible to pass multiple values through a 
single variable.
1.	 Reopen the child dashboard you created earlier.
2.	 Open the Data Manager and select the Flash Variables connection we 
already created.
3.	 Change the Variable Format from XML to CSV.
4.	 Bind the Range of Variable1 to cell A1 through A3. Close the Data Manager windows.
5.	 Replace the Label component with a Spreadsheet component.
6.	 Bind this Spreadsheet component to cells A1 until A3.
7.	
Export the dashboard to an SWF file again. Name it child.swf.
8.	 Open the parent.swf file. 
9.	 Enter multiple values, separated by a comma (,) and see what happens.

Accessing dashboards with live data outside 
of Infoview using CELogonToken
Not all corporations want their employees to access dashboards through ��������������
BI Launch Pad� 
(Infoview). Some may want to access dashboards through a third-party website or portal such 
as MS Sharepoint. Unfortunately, a logon prompt will pop up if a user tries to execute a live 
query when they are not logged into BI Launch Pad.
So we will need some sort of hidden login mechanism that bypasses the pop up to refresh 
data on the dashboard. In our example, we assume that there is one login that can view 
dashboards. Using that login we will then populate the CELogonToken, which then allows 
authentication to occur transparently. 
Getting ready
Create a dashboard that has a connection to either a Query as a Web Service object or 
Live Office object. In this recipe, we create a QaaWS object, using the eFashion 1997 demo 
universe. Select the� Month ��������������
dimension and� Sales Revenue measure as the Result Objects. 
On the Filter insert Holiday Y/N and �������
choose� equal to and prompt.

guide to creating a QaaWS object and using it on a dashboard.
How to do it...
1.	 Create a folder called DashboardTest in <BO Installation>\Tomcat55\
webapps\InfoViewApp\ (In the How it works... section, we will explain why).
2.	 Insert the Test.swf file in the directory that you created in step 1 (<BO 
Installation>\Tomcat55\webapps\InfoViewApp\DashboardTest).
3.	 Create a file called dashboardTest.jsp in <BO Installation>\Tomcat55\
webapps\InfoViewApp\DashboardTest.
4.	 Insert the code snippet below into the dashboardTest.jsp file. The highlighted 
server, username, password, port, and SWF name are the variables that you will need 
to change to match your configuration.

How it works...
Let's first go through how a dashboard SWF is normally consumed inside InfoviewInfoView. The 
most important part here is that there is a CELogonToken flash variable that gets assigned a 
session token that BOE creates when you successfully log in to InfoviewInfoView.

Dashboard Connectivity
238
How does Dashboard Design consume CELogonToken?
If you look inside the <OBJECT> tag in the code below, you will see that there is a flash 
variable called CELogonToken, which is highlighted. When SAP BusinessObjects renders the 
HTML page, it dynamically inserts the current logon token into the CELogonToken variable. 
Any dashboard that uses a QaaWS or Live Office connection will automatically consume the 
CELogonToken flash variable.

</OBJECT>
CELogonToken at runtime
Dashboards that have a QaaWS or Live Office connection will search for the CELogonToken 
when the connection is triggered. With each transaction to SAP BusinessObjects, the token is 
passed back to SAP BusinessObjects for authentication. If CELogonToken does not exist, the 
login pop up will show up. This happens if we view the dashboard outside of Infoview. Thus, 
our goal in this recipe is to retrieve a SAP BusinessObjects logon token and insert it into the 
CELogonToken flash variable. This is accomplished in the code on �������
step 4.
Step-by-step code explanation
The first part of the code imports the required libraries from the SAP BusinessObjects 
SDK to retrieve the logon token. ��������������������������������������������
Step 1 �������������������������������������
mentions creating a directory inside tomcat55\
InfoViewApp\. The reason being that we do not have to worry about any import issues, as 
all the SDK JARs are inside the InfoviewApp lib folder. In reality, you can place the .jsp and 
.swf anywhere but you will have to make sure that the SDK libraries are loaded.

%>
<%@ page import=""java.sql.*""%>
The second part of the code sets the server, username, and password. We can use a hard 
coded username/password if we want one universal dashboard user that has view access 
to a set of dashboards, which makes maintenance easier. If you are interested in Single Sign 
On, you will have to write some extra code to grab the appropriate username and password 
(this is out of the scope of this recipe). The code bolded in the try block retrieves the SAP 
BusinessObjects logon token.

Exporting and 
Publishing
In this chapter, we will cover:
Exporting to a standard SWF, PPT, PDF, and so on
Exporting to SAP Business Objects Enterprise
Publishing to SAP BW
Dashboard Builder/Performance Management
Building widgets (Adobe AIR)
Introduction
After building your dashboard to be the way you like it, you will need to turn it into a format 
that everyone is able to view on their computers. This is when the developers will export and 
publish their dashboard.
First, the visual model is compiled to a SWF file format. Compiling to a SWF file format ensures 
that the dashboard plays smoothly on different screen sizes and across different platforms. It 
also ensures that the users aren't given huge 10+ megabyte files.
After compilation of the visual model to a SWF file, developers can then publish it to a format 
of their choice. The following are the available choices—Flash (SWF), AIR, SAP BusinessObjects 
Platform, HTML, PDF, PPT, Outlook, and Word. 
Once publishing is complete, the dashboard is ready to share!

Exporting to a standard SWF, PPT, PDF, and 
so on
After developing a Visual Model on Dashboard Design, we will need to somehow share it with 
users. We want to put it into a format that everyone can see on their machines. The simplest 
way is to export to a standard SWF file.
One of the great features Dashboard Design has is to be able to embed dashboards into 
different office file formats. For example, a presenter could have a PowerPoint deck, and in 
the middle of the presentation, have a working dashboard that presents an important set of 
data values to the audience. Another example could be an executive level user who is viewing 
a Word document created by an analyst. The analyst could create a written document in Word 
and then embed a working dashboard with the most updated data to present important data 
values to the executive level user.
You can choose to embed a dashboard in the following file types:
PowerPoint
Word
PDF
Outlook
HTML
Getting ready
Make sure your visual model is complete and ready for sharing.

Chapter 9
243
How to do it...
1.	 In the menu toolbar, go to File | Export | Flash (SWF).
2.	 Select the directory in which you want the SWF to go to and the name of your 
SWF file.
How it works...
Xcelsius compiles the visual model into an SWF file that everyone is able to see. Once the 
SWF file has been compiled, the dashboard will then be ready for sharing. It is mandatory 
that anyone viewing the dashboard have Adobe Flash installed. If not, they can download 
and install it from http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/.
If we export to PPT, we can then edit the PowerPoint file however we desire. If you have an 
existing PowerPoint presentation deck and want to append the dashboard to it, the easiest 
way is to first embed the dashboard SWF to a temporary PowerPoint file and then copy that 
slide to your existing PowerPoint file.
There's more...
Exporting to an SWF file makes it very easy for distribution, thus making the presentation of 
mockups great at a business level. Developers are able to work very closely with the business 
and iteratively come up with a visual model closest to the business goals. It is important 
though, when distributing SWF files, that everyone viewing the dashboards has the same 
version, otherwise confusion may occur. Thus, as a best practice, versioning every SWF 
that is distributed is very important.

Exporting and Publishing
244
It is important to note that when the much anticipated Adobe Flash 10.1 was 
released, there were problems with embedding Dashboard Design dashboards 
in DOC, PPT, PDF, and so on. However, with the 10.1.82.76 Adobe Flash Player 
update, this has been fixed. Thus, it is important that if users have Adobe Flash 
Player 10.1+ installed, the version is higher than or equal to 10.1.82.76.
When exporting to PDF, please take the following into account: In Dashboard Design 2008, 
the default format for exporting to PDF is Acrobat 9.0 (PDF 1.8). If Acrobat Reader 8.0 is 
installed, the default exported PDF cannot be opened. If using Acrobat Reader 8.0 or older, 
change the format to "Acrobat 6.0 (PDF 1.5)" before exporting to PDF.
Exporting to SAP Business Objects 
Enterprise
After Dashboard Design became a part of BusinessObjects, it was important to be able 
to export dashboards into the BusinessObjects Enterprise system. Once a dashboard is 
exported to BusinessObjects Enterprise, users can then easily access their dashboards 
through InfoView (now BI launch pad). On top of that, administrators are able control 
dashboard security.
Getting ready
Make sure your visual model is complete and ready for sharing.
How to do it...
1.	 From the menu toolbar, go to File | Export | Export to SAP BusinessObjects 
Platform.

Chapter 9
245
2.	 Enter your BusinessObjects login credentials and then select the location in the SAP 
BusinessObjects Enterprise system, where you want to store the SWF file, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
3.	 Log into BI launch pad (formerly known as InfoView) and verify that you can access 
the dashboard.

Exporting and Publishing
246
How it works...
When we export a dashboard to SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise, we basically place it in the 
SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise content management system. From there, we can control 
accessibility to the dashboard and make sure that we have one source of truth instead of 
sending out multiple dashboards through e-mail and possibly getting mixed up with what 
is the latest version. When we log into BI launch pad (formerly known as Infoview), it also 
passes the login token to the dashboard, so we don't have to enter our credentials again when 
connecting to SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise data. This is important because we don't have 
to manually create and pass any additional tokens once we have logged in.
There's more...
To give a true website type feel, developers can house their dashboards in a website type 
format using Dashboard Builder. This in turn provides a better experience for users, as they 
don't have to navigate through many folders in order to access the dashboard that they are 
looking for.

Please read the recipe Housing your dashboards in Dashboard Builder to learn how to 
utilize the Dashboard Builder tool in BI launch pad (formerly known as InfoView) to make 
the accessibility of your dashboards more user/Web friendly.
Publishing to SAP BW
This recipe shows you how to publish Dashboard Design dashboards to a SAP BW system. 
Once a dashboard is saved to the SAP BW system, it can be published within a SAP Enterprise 
Portal iView and made available for the users. 
Getting ready
For this recipe, you will need an Dashboard Design dashboard model. This dashboard does 
not necessarily have to include a data connection to SAP BW. 
How to do it...
1.	 Select Publish in the SAP menu. If you want to save the Xcelsius model with a 
different name, select the Publish As... option. 

Chapter 9
247
2.	 If you are not yet connected to the SAP BW system, a pop up will appear. Select the 
appropriate system and fill in your username and password in the dialog box. 
3.	 If you want to disconnect from the SAP BW system and connect to a different system, 
select the Disconnect option from the SAP menu.
4.	 Enter the Description and Technical Name of the dashboard. Select the location you 
want to save the dashboard to and click on Save. The dashboard is now published to 
the SAP BW system.

Exporting and Publishing
248
5.	 To launch the dashboard and view it from the SAP BW environment, select the 
Launch option from the SAP menu. You will be asked to log in to the SAP BW 
system before you are able to view the dashboard.
How it works...
As we have seen in this recipe, the publishing of an Dashboard Design dashboard to SAP BW 
is quite straightforward. As the dashboard is part of the SAP BW environment after publishing, 
the model can be transported between SAP BW systems like all other SAP BW objects. 
There is more...
After launching step 5, the Dashboard Design dashboard will load in your browser from the 
SAP BW server. You can add the displayed URL to an SAP Enterprise Portal iView to make the 
dashboard accessible for portal users.
Housing your dashboard in Dashboard 
Builder
Using Dashboard Builder to organize your dashboards allows users to customize the look 
and feel to how the dashboards are accessed. In addition, administrators are able to control 
access to each navigational layout. When we house dashboards in Dashboard Builder, users 
don't have to navigate through numerous folders in order to get to their desired dashboard, 
but instead navigate through web page style type logic to access their desired dashboard. 
In our example, we will set up a Corporate Dashboard using Dashboard Builder, which will 
contain navigation to three dashboards.

Chapter 9
249
Getting ready
Make sure you have your dashboards created. In our example, we have an executive 
dashboard and two regional dashboards.

Exporting and Publishing
250
How to do it...
1.	 In BI launch pad (formerly known as InfoView), click on Dashboards | Create 
Corporate Dashboard.
2.	 Type a name for the corporate dashboard.
3.	 Specify the folder in which you want to save the dashboard.
4.	 Select a category and then click on OK.

Chapter 9
251
5.	 Next, click on Edit dashboard. 
6.	 Click on the Toolbox link.
7.	
Select the Corporate Analytic icon.
8.	 Drag the executive dashboard onto the canvas. 
9.	 Click on the Add a new tab link and name it Region 1 Sales.

Exporting and Publishing
252
10.	 Drag the region 1 dashboard onto the canvas. 
11.	 Click on the Add a new tab link and name it Region 2 Inventory information.
12.	Drag the region 2 dashboard onto the canvas.
How it works...
As you can see, when we set up the Corporate Dashboard using Dashboard Builder, it is 
easier to access the dashboards rather than clicking through a bunch of folders. You can think 
of Dashboard Builder as a container that holds all the dashboards.
There's more...
You can also customize the home page of the Corporate Dashboard you are creating with 
the Dashboard Builder as HTML. Creating an HTML homepage is out of scope of this book; 
however, you can go to http://w3schools.com to learn how. From the homepage, you 
can have links that go directly to whatever dashboard tab you desire, which makes navigation 
similar to a website.

Creating Adobe Air Applets from Dashboard 
Design dashboard
Why would one want to export to Adobe Air from Dashboard Design one may ask? Well, here is 
some background on what a widget is.
Widgets are interactive virtual tools that provide single-purpose services 
such as showing the user the latest news, the current weather, the time, a 
calendar, a dictionary, a map program, a calculator, desktop notes, photo 
viewers, or even a language translator—Wikipedia.
Widgets are:
Lightweight
Reside on desktop
Have a simple, non-distracting interface
Provide valuable information in real time
Easy interface for performing common tasks

The ability to create Adobe Air Applets from a Dashboard Design dashboard is very important 
because it allows us to harness the power of Dashboard Design to create simple widgets 
that connect to live data with the same look and feel we get from our well known Dashboard 
Design components. An example of a three-gauge widget is shown next:
In this recipe, we will create a widget, export it to Air, and then install the widget to our system.

Exporting and Publishing
254
Getting ready
Make sure that the Visual Model is complete and ready to export. 
How to do it...
1.	 Download the Flex 3.0 SDK from the following URL: 
	
http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=flex3email
Note: The download will say "Download a free trial of Flash 
Builder 4 Premium Edition", but don't worry, the Flex 3.0 SDK 
is inside.
2.	 Unzip the SDK into the following folder:
	
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Flex Builder 3 Plug-in\sdks\3.0
3.	 Update the Xcelsius sdkPath.dat to reflect the path above. This is usually located 
in the following path (you can edit the sdkPath.dat with Notepad):
	
C:\Program Files\Business Objects\Xcelsius\assets\air
4.	 Download and install Adobe Air from:
	
http://get.adobe.com/air/
5.	 On Xcelsius, click on File | Export | Air…

Chapter 9
255
6.	 Choose Gauge Air Test for the Name. Choose the air_icon.png found in the source 
directory for the application icon. Finally, choose whatever destination you want the 
.air file to reside in. Name it airwidget.air.
7.	
Install the Xcelsius widget using the .air file that was created from the export. Do 
this by double-clicking on the airwidget.air icon. You can choose wherever you want 
for the Installation Location.

Exporting and Publishing
256
8.	 Run the widget from the desktop shortcut or from the program directory you 
installed it in. 
How it works...
Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR) is a cross-platform runtime environment developed by 
Adobe Systems for building rich Internet applications using Adobe Flash, Adobe Flex, HTML, 
or Ajax, which can be deployed as a desktop application. 
In steps 1 and 2, we install the Adobe Flex SDK to our system. Then in step 3, we link 
Dashboard Design to the SDK files.
Note that by default we do not have Dashboard Design linked to the 
Adobe Flex SDK because if it were included in the Dashboard Design 
installation, the installation would be about 200 MB larger.
After linking Dashboard Design to the Adobe Flex SDK, we are able to export from Dashboard 
Design to an Adobe AIR file, where we can then deploy the widget to our desktop.

Introduction
As we have seen throughout this book, Dashboard Design gives us an almost overwhelming 
package of tools to create the most stunning dashboards. Even this may not be enough 
for your specific dashboard. With Dashboard Design, SDK developers are able to create 
add-ons for Dashboard Design to provide that extra functionality that does not come with 
the Dashboard Design software.
This chapter will discuss several of the top third-party Dashboard Design add-ons that are 
available. Some of them can be downloaded for free while others need to be purchased. 
Without exception, all of these add-ons are free to tryout before you have to make the decision 
whether to buy or not. We will not discuss all third-party add-ons that are available at the 
moment, as there are simply too many of them already. We had to limit ourselves to those 
add-ons that stand out the most and are the most applicable for a large number of users.

Top Third-Party Add-ons
258
The recipes in this chapter will not be as detailed as the other recipes in this book. The goal of 
this chapter is rather to give you a quick introduction to the basic functionality of the add-ons 
and how to set this up. After reading a recipe, you should have a good understanding of the 
possibilities of the add-on and whether it might be interesting for you to spend more time on it 
or not. We will also guide you to the resources for more information on each add-on.
Managing add-ons in Dashboard Design
In this recipe, we will show you where you can find third-party add-ons and how to add and 
remove them in Dashboard Design.
Getting ready
To install an add-on, you’ll first need to download the add-on. The following recipes in this 
chapter will guide you to the right places to get these files. 
If you are using Windows Vista, you must turn off User Account Control 
(UAC), otherwise the Add-On Manager menu items will be disabled.
Go to Start | Control Panel | User Accounts | Turn User Account Control 
on or off
How to do it...
1.	 To add or remove add-ons, we need to use the Add-On Manager. Go to the File menu 
and select Manage Add-Ons.
2.	 The Add-On Manager pops up and shows which add-ons are already installed. If you 
already downloaded an add-on, you can click on the Install Add-On button. Browse 
to the add-on’s XLX file and open it. The add-on will be installed instantly. You need to 
restart Dashboard Design to use the new add-on(s).
3.	 If you want to remove an add-on, first select the add-on and click the Remove 
Add-On button. Confirm the removal and the add-on will be deleted from your 
Dashboard Design installation. 

Chapter 10
259
4.	 A good place to find add-ons is the SAP EcoHub (http://ecohub.sdn.sap.com/). 
On this website, you can find certified solutions not only for SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards, but also for other SAP enterprise applications.

Top Third-Party Add-ons
260
5.	 Another place to find and download add-ons are the developer websites. In each 
recipe of this chapter we will guide you to these sites.
Connecting to CSV-files with the 
CSV-connector
In Chapter 8, Dashboard Connectivity, we discussed a number of data connectivity options 
for Dashboard Design dashboards. In addition to these standard data connections, Centigon 
Solutions developed an add-on that allows us to use Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files to 
grab data from. This recipe will give you a quick walkthrough of the features of this add-on.
Getting ready
Go to the Centigon Solutions website (http://www.centigonsolutions.com/) and 
browse for the CSV connector. Download the free trial and install it with the Add-On Manager. 
You also need a sample CSV file to use in this recipe. 
How to do it...
1.	 Open a new Dashboard Design file and go to the spreadsheet area. Enter the location 
of the CSV file in cell C1.
2.	 Open the Data Manager and click on the Add button. Under Add-On connection, you 
will see the CSV Connector. Select it.
3.	 Give this connection a name. Bind the CSV Data URL field to cell C1.

How it works...
The CSV connector add-on from Centigon Solutions is an ideal data connector, if you do not 
have the options to use server data providers such as QaaWS or SAP BW. Especially for the 
smaller enterprises, this is a very good solution to provide your dashboards with fresh data.
A nice feature of this component is the possibility to preview the data in the data manager. 
This will help you to set up the component without having to preview the dashboard every time 
to check out how the data will be loaded in the spreadsheet.

In the recipe, we showed how to filter the dataset of the CSV file. You can use this option 
to load only the data you will actually need, which will improve the performance of the 
dashboard. Furthermore, in the Definition tab of this add-on in the Data Manager you can 
define which columns and rows should be loaded.

Calculations
Besides displaying the data from a CSV file and filtering the values, the CSV connector add-on 
can also do some calculations. 
1.	 Add another row above the data destination area. There are four calculation values. 
Enter a calculation value for each column.
Column 1: Lists the values, separated by a comma
Column 2: Counts the number of rows
Column 3: Calculates the sum of values
Column 4: Calculates the average of values
2.	 Next, we have to enter a single value index that indicates on which column the 
calculations are applied. 
3.	 Open the Data Manager and bind the Column Calculations field and the 
Column Calculation Index field to the corresponding cells you just entered 
in the spreadsheet.

Integrating Google Maps with the GMaps 
plugin
In the recipe Using maps to select data of an area or country in Chapter 3, we introduced the 
standard map options that Dashboard Design offers. Then, in the recipe Displaying alerts on a 
map in Chapter 5, we discussed how to use alerts on these maps. Centigon Solutions raised 
the bar on this topic and introduced the GMaps plugin for Dashboard Design. 
With this add-on, we can completely integrate Google Maps in a Dashboard Design 
dashboard. This means that we can use the graphics we know from Google Maps (map, 
satellite, hybrid, terrain, and so on) and functionalities such as zooming in or out on a map. 
Furthermore, the GMaps plugin integrates with other Dashboard Design components. We 
can make selections from a map region and display alerts, single points (such as cities or 
buildings), and heat maps on the map.
This recipe will introduce you to this add-on and show you how to create a map with alerts and 
selectable regions.
Getting ready
This recipe needs some preparation. First, go to the Centigon Solutions website 
(http://www.centigonsolutions.com/) and download the GMaps plugin 
add-on trial. Install it with the Add-On Manager.
Next we need a Google Maps API key. Go to the Google Maps API Family website 
(http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html) and sign up to get your 
personal key. Without this key, the component won’t be able to display any Google Maps.

We also need a so-called shapefile. This provides the overlay for a geographical area. There 
are lots of free SHP files available on the Internet; for example, on this website: http://www.
vdstech.com/map_data.htm. In this recipe, we are using the Europe shapefile. Download 
the ZIP archive and extract it. The extracted folder includes at least the SHP file, a DBF file, 
and a SHX file. 
How to do it...
1.	 Open MS Excel and go to Open.
2.	 Set the Files of type to All Files.
3.	 Browse for the DBF file and open it.
4.	 A spreadsheet with a list of countries will appear, including some additional, country-
specific data.

A pop up is shown stating that you will lose everything in your existing spreadsheet. 
As we opened a blank Dashboard Design file, we can click on Yes.
8.	 Insert five rows above the data from the DFB file. Right-click row 1 and select Insert. 
Repeat this four times.
9.	 Enter your Google Maps API key in spreadsheet cell C1.
10.	 Drag the Gmaps Plugin component to the canvas. You will find this component at the 
bottom of the Maps components folder.
11.	 Bind the Key field of the Gmaps plugin to cell C1. The Gmaps Plugin component now 
changes into a real Google Map of the world. 
12.	Enter the location of the SHP file in cell C2.

15.	If you now hit the Preview button, the shapefile for Europe should be visible on top of 
the Google Map.
The shapefile will not appear in preview mode if you are 
using a relative path.
16.	 Now return to the properties pane of the Gmaps Plugin component and bind the 
Labels field and the Values field to the corresponding cells in the spreadsheet.
17.	 Set the Insertion Type to Row and bind the Source Data field to the cells we just 
bound to the Labels and Values fields. Also, bind the Destination field to cell range 
B4 until C4.

How it works...
This recipe required a lot of preparation before we could perform the actual binding of 
the data to the Gmaps plugin component. In this recipe, we showed you how to use SHP 
files. These files provide a layer on top of the Google Map. This enables us to make regions 
selectable or fill them with colors to show alerts.
The DBF file provided us with the meta-data on the SHP file (that is the country codes and 
names). After importing this information into the spreadsheet the set up of this component 
has a lot of similarities with the configuration of the standard Dashboard Design Map 
components, like we discussed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 5.
The SHX file can be used to combine SHP and DBF files for GIS solutions, where this file is 
required to maintain the integrity between the files when used in GIS solutions. The GMaps 
plugin does not utilize this SHX file.
In the Behavior tab, we entered the coordinates for Europe, so the map will by default show 
Europe. You can find these coordinates for example on this site: http://universimmedia.
pagesperso-orange.fr/geo/loc.htm.
In addition, if you want to zoom in more or less you can change the Zoom Level.
Setting up the alerts in the GMaps plugin works just like configuring the Alerts tab in the 
standard Dashboard Design components, with the addition that you can also use icons as 
alerts in the GMaps plugin component.

Connecting to Salesforce.com with 
DashConn
What about using live data from your Salesforce.com reports in Dashboard Design to create 
interactive dashboards to show, track, and analyze your sales activities? DashConn is a 
Dashboard Design add-on by IdeaCrop that delivers  this integration. Let’s have a look at 
the features of this add-on and how to set it up.
Getting ready
As we are connecting to Salesforce.com you obviously need a Salesforce.com account. You 
can sign up for a free trial at http://www.salesforce.com/.
To connect to Salesforce.com from a Dashboard Design dashboard a security token is 
required. You can get this security token from the Personal Setup menu at Salesforce.com.

4.	 Now go to the Data Output tab and bind the Main result destination field to 
spreadsheet cell range A6 through E20.
5.	 Bind the Selection destination field to cell range G6 until K20.
6.	 Make sure that the Place column names in the first row option are selected. We can 
use these column names later on when we add some chart components and have to 
bind the series names.
7.	
Preview the dashboard to see how the data is being returned (and filled in 
the spreadsheet cells that we bound in step 4). You will be asked to fill in 
your credentials.

8.	 Leave preview mode and drag a Column Chart component to the canvas.
9.	 Bind the Column Chart component to the columns you want to show in the chart. 
Remember that the first row will show the column names. Also, do not forget to select 
the Ignore Blank Cells options in the Behavior tab of the chart component. In this 
recipe example, we are showing two series—Actual Costs and Budgeted Costs.
10.	 Now add another chart to the canvas and bind it to one or more columns from the 
Selection destination area (step 5). In this recipe example, we want to show the 
Total Leads in a Bar Chart.
11.	 Preview the dashboard. As you will see the Column Chart will display data right 
away. If you select a row in the Salesforce.com DataViewer, the Bar Chart will 
also be filled. 
You can use CTRL and click or SHIFT and click to select 
multiple rows.

Data Output tab. 
15.	We want to filter the records based on the value in the Total Responses column. To 
do this, select the correct column from the Prompt Column selector and bind the 
Prompt Value field to cell C1. For the Prompt Operator, we select greaterOrEqual.
16.	 Preview the dashboard once more.

279
How it works...
The Salesforce.com DataViewer component does most of the work for us. As you have 
seen we only had to enter our Salesforce.com credentials, select a report, and preview the 
dashboard to see how the data will be returned. After binding the fields of the Data Output 
tab we are able to reuse the report data in other components. 
The Salesforce.com DataViewer component has some nice run-time features to drill down or 
up in the report data, open the Salesforce.com details page of all selected items, set filters, 
and aggregate data by a certain field. With these options you can dynamically change the 
data being retrieved by the Salesforce.com DataViewer. This also means that the values in 
spreadsheet cells that are bound to the Main result destination field in the Data Output tab 
change as well.

Salesforce.com Data Manager Connection
A very nice feature of this add-on is that it also has a Connection option that is available from 
the Data Manager. With this Connection, you can use data Salesforce.com report data in 
your dashboards without having to use the Salesforce.com DataViewer component. Another 
important feature of the connection option is that it offers the ability to constantly refresh 
data from Salesforce.com reports—just like other connection options—without being prompted 
for credentials. Except for the Usage tab, most settings are similar to those of the Salesforce.
com DataViewer component.

Working Mode settings
In the Behavior tab of the component and Data Manager connection, you can find the 
Working Mode setting. In the default Online setting, an Internet connection is required to use 
the component to connect to Salesforce.com. In offline mode, the (first level of) report data is 
embedded within the dashboard. The third online/fallback to offline mode is a combination of 
the online and offline modes and will try to retrieve live data first; but if this fails, it uses the 
embedded data.
Transferring data between dashboards with 
Data Sharer
The Data Sharer add-on by Inovista is a very simple but powerful add-on that lets you share 
data between separate Dashboard Design dashboards.

How it works...
In this recipe, we used the Data Sharer to send values from one dashboard to another. The 
first dashboard is the data transmitter, while the second dashboard constantly listens for 
incoming values. The values will be sent at startup and whenever the values change.
If you want to use more than one communication line between dashboards, you can add 
multiple Data Sharer components. You have to make sure that the Connection Name is 
the same for all the Data Sharer components among the different dashboards that need to 
communicate with each other.
If you create a Corporate Dashboard with the Dashboard Builder in BI Launch 
Pad (formerly know as InfoView), you can make dashboards communicate 
with each other using the Data Sharer. See also the recipe Housing your 
dashboard in Dashboard Builder in Chapter 9.
Presenting micro charts in a tree grid
The Micro Chart Suite is an extensive set of small charting components by Inovista. It 
includes a micro version of most of the chart types that are part of the standard Dashboard 
Design components: A bar chart, area chart, stacked bar chart, bullet chart, column chart, 
line chart, and pie chart. In addition, there are components to show micro versions of a plot 
chart, win/lose chart, shape alerts, a traffic light, and a text/number indicator.
You can use these components separately, but another nice feature by Inovista is the tree grid 
component in which we can present micro charts in a hierarchical format. This recipe shows 
you how to set up such a tree grid component with a few of micro charts.

How it works...
As we have seen in this recipe, the Inovista Micro Chart Suite offers a good solution to present 
numerous data visualizations in a very compact way. The MicroChart Tree Grid component 
gives us a framework to display these micro charts in a structured and hierarchical way. 
To use the MicroChart Tree Grid component, we have to define the spreadsheet in the 
right way. We first created a hierarchical structure with three levels—global, continents, and 
countries. Next, we added all the data for the graphs in the columns, where each node has its 
own row of data.

If you don’t want or don’t need to show a hierarchical structure in your dashboard, you can 
use the MicroChart Table component as another container to present the micro charts in. 
The only difference is that this component doesn’t have the Tree Column and Tree Row 
Colors sub-tabs.

Integrating Web Intelligence with Antivia 
XWIS
Antivia XWIS is an add-on by Antivia that lets us connect to Web Intelligence documents, 
Crystal Reports and even SQL databases and OLAP cubes. Also, it comes with a large set of 
components to display and analyze the retrieved data.
As we have seen in Chapter 8, Dashboard Design is already able to connect to a number 
of data sources. This recipe will show you some of the possibilities of Antivia XWIS and the 
advantages it has over the standard connection types.

The Antivia Table component enables us to analyze a very large set of data (30.000+ rows) 
from within a dashboard, without the need to configure multiple data connections with QaaWS 
or Live Office, setting up the spreadsheet and defining the bindings to a component. This is a 
huge efficiency gain!
We demonstrated the AutoWire feature that makes dashboard development even easier and 
faster because it completely takes care of the bindings of data to standard Dashboard Design

Alerts
In all data-based Antivia XWIS components, alerts can be used to highlight cells when a certain 
condition is met. A nice feature here is that these alert definitions are stored in the Antivia XWIS 
repository, so they can be reused in other components or even in other dashboards.

Antivia Timer component
The Antivia Timer component is the only component that can work standalone and does 
not need a session token to run. It writes the current time to a cell at a defined interval. This 
component can be useful to trigger components with the Refresh on change option or in 
combination with dynamic visibility.
Taking the dashboard offline
With the Antivia Disconnect component, it is possible to take a connected dashboard offline 
and secure the data using 128-bit encryption within the dashboard. This allows the end 
users to interact with their dashboard in almost the same way as the online version. With 
XBroadcast, Antivia extends this feature to generate personalized dashboards that can be 
published and distributed beyond the enterprise via e-mail using a SAP BusinessObjects 
Business Intelligence platform.

Selecting your data from a list
Illustrating single values
Using the pie chart
Chapter 7, Dashboard Look and Feel 
Getting ready
As we are starting from scratch, you only have to open a new Dashboard Design file. 
How to do it...
1.	 The dashboard will contain four variables—Mortgage amount, Mortgage term in 
years, Yearly interest rate, and a variable that states if the mortgage will be paid off 
by equal monthly payments (annuity) or just at the end of the mortgage term, that is 
the Monthly interest rate.

2.	 First, we set up the spreadsheet. Make sure your spreadsheet looks like the 
following screenshot: 
3.	 To calculate the monthly and total payments we need the mortgage term in months, 
which is the number of years multiplied by 12. Add the following Excel formula to cell 
B3: =B2*12.
4.	 To calculate the monthly interest rate we need the following formula: 
=(1+B4)^(1/12)-1. Enter it in cell B5.
5.	 Now drag three Horizontal Slider components to the canvas.
6.	 Bind the Data field of the first Horizontal Slider component to cell B1. Also, set the 
Maximum Limit to 1000000. Enter Mortgage as Title.
7.	
Select the second Horizontal Slider component and bind its Data field to cell B4. Set 
the Maximum Limit to 0.1. As we are dealing with percentages, the maximum limit is 
now 10% due to this setting. Enter Interest rate as Title.
8.	 Go to the Behavior tab and in the Slider Movement section change the Increment 
to 0.001. 
9.	 Select the third Horizontal Slider component and bind the Data field of this one to 
cell B2. Set the Maximum Limit to 30 and enter Period (years) as a Title.

Real World Dashboard Case Studies
302
10.	 Now we need to add some more logic to our spreadsheet to calculate the monthly 
payments. Adjust your spreadsheet so it looks like the following screenshot:
11.	 Enter the following formula in cell B8 to calculate the monthly annuity: 
=B1*(B5/(1-(1+B5)^(-B3))).
12.	Enter the next formula in cell B9 to calculate the total amount: =B3*B8.
13.	Enter the formula =B9-B1 in cell B10 to calculate the total interest amount.
14.	 In cell C8 enter formula =B1*(B4^1/12) to calculate the monthly amount, which is 
only the interest.
15.	Enter formula =B3*C8 in cell C10 and enter formula =B1+C10 in cell C9.
16.	 Add a Combo Box component to the canvas. We will use this component to determine 
if the mortgage will be paid off by monthly installments. Bind the Labels field to cells 
B7 and C7. Go to the Behavior tab and set Item to Label 1.
17.	 Return to the General tab and in the Data Insertion section set the Insertion Type to 
Column. Bind the Source Data field to cell range B8 until C10. Bind the Destination 
field to cells D8 until D10.
18.	Finally, enter Monthly pay off? as a Title.

Appendix A
303
19.	Go back to the spreadsheet and enter formula =B1 in cell D11. 
20.	Now our spreadsheet and all the selectors are set up, it is time to show some data in 
the dashboard. Add a Gauge component to the canvas.
21.	 Bind its By Range field to cell D8 and set the Maximum Limit field to 5000. Enter the 
Monthly amount as a Title.
22.	Add another Gauge component to the canvas and bind its By Range field to cell D9. 
Set its Maximum Limit field to 10000000. Enter Total amount as a Title.
23.	Drag a Pie Chart component to the canvas. Bind its Values field to cells D10 and 
D11. Also, bind the Labels field to cells A10 and A11. Enter Division total amount as 
a Title.
24.	 Go to the Appearance tab and deselect Show Chart Background. Set the position of 
the legend to Bottom.
25.	All right! The what-if section of the dashboard is now in place and ready to be tested. 
Preview the dashboard and play around with the sliders and selectors to see if 
everything works.

Real World Dashboard Case Studies
304
26.	Leave the preview mode. We will now adjust the layout of the dashboard so it looks a 
bit smoother. 
27.	 First select the Phase theme from the Theme selector in the Format menu.
28.	Use the Alignment options from the Format menu to adjust the placement of the 
three sliders and the selector. 
You can also use the Grid to get the layout right. You can activate 
the Grid in the Preferences menu in the File menu. 
29.	Add a Rectangular component and resize it so it will fit over the sliders and selector. 
Change the Border Color to color a bit lighter, for example gray.
30.	Add a Label component to the canvas and enter Mortgage Calculator in the Enter 
Text field. Select the Appearance tab and go to the Text sub-tab. Select Bold and set 
the Text Size to 28. Make sure you resize the Label component if the text doesn’t fit 
anymore.

Appendix A
305
31.	 Select the Pie Chart and the Gauge components. Align them by Middle and Space 
Evenly Across. 
32.	As you can see the title of the Pie Chart is placed a bit higher than the titles of the 
Gauges. Select both Gauge components. Go to the Appearance tab and select the 
Text sub-tab. Now adjust the Y Offset so all titles will have the same height.
33.	Select Value. In the Format Selected Text section, select Bold and adjust the Y 
Offset so the values of the Gauge components will be at the same height as the 
legend of the Pie Chart component. 
34.	Go to the Behavior tab and deselect the Enable Interaction option.
35.	Add another Rectangular component to the canvas and place it over the Gauges 
and Pie Chart. 

Real World Dashboard Case Studies
306
36.	Select Fit the Canvas to Components from the Canvas Sizing options in the View 
menu. You can also use the buttons from the Standard Toolbar. Select the Increase 
Canvas option twice.
37.	 Your what-if dashboard is finished!
How it works...
In steps 1-4, 10-15, and 19, we utilize what we learned in the Chapter 1 (Staying in 
Control) recipes to properly set up the spreadsheet.
In steps 5-9, we set up the sliders like we did in the Using sliders to create a What-If 
scenario recipe.
In steps 16-18, we use recipe Selecting your data from a list to define the Combo Box 
component to determine if the mortgage is paid off or not.
Steps 20-24 use recipes illustrating single values and using the pie chart to show the 
data in two gauges and a pie chart.
In the final steps, we used what we have learned from the Chapter 7, Dashboard 
Look and Feel recipes to implement a different dashboard theme and fine-tune the 
look of the dashboard.
Sales/profit dashboard example
In this example, we will utilize many techniques that we have learned in the previous recipes 
to create a Sales Profit dashboard.
The Sales Profit dashboard displays the sales or profit of each state on the map. From the 
map, a user can then select a state and then view year to date sales/profit information for 
products that are sold on the top right. The user can then drill down further by clicking on a 
product. A detailed scorecard and trend chart will then be shown for the selected state 
and product.

How to do it...
1.	 Drag the Map – USA component onto the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Region Keys to the State keys on the Control Sheet tab.
3.	 On the Data Insertion section, select Row as the Insertion Type and the Source 
Data will be the keys that we selected in step 2. The destination will be cell E1.
4.	 Bind the Display Data to the key value pair items in the Map Display worksheet.
5.	 Go to the Alerts properties, check the Enable Alerts checkbox, select By Value, 
check the Use a Range checkbox, and bind to the range section in the Map Display 
worksheet. It is important that you bind starting at 2500, otherwise it will add another 
range starting from the minimum to 0.

Appendix A
309
6.	 The next step is to complete the YTD chart on the top right-hand side. Drag a Bar 
Chart component onto the top right-hand side of the canvas.
7.	
Bind the Titles to the appropriate cells on column T of the State and Drilldown 
Display Worksheet. Then Bind the Data to the cells in purple. The values in the 
purple cells are populated depending on whether a user selects Sales or Profit. 
Note that the cells are pre-populated with test data.

Real World Dashboard Case Studies
310
8.	 Go to the Drill Down properties of the YTD chart. Check the Enable Drill Down 
checkbox and select Row as the Insertion Type. Bind the source data to the peach 
section (columns A to Q) of the State and Drilldown Display worksheet. Bind the 
destination to the cells in yellow (columns A to Q). Note that the peach and yellow 
cells are pre-populated with test data.
9.	 The next step is to complete the Scorecard on the middle right-hand side of the 
dashboard. Drag a Scorecard component onto the canvas.
10.	 Bind the Display Data to the yellow cells of the Drilldown Scorecard section on the 
State and Drilldown Display worksheet. These yellow cells are the drilldown values 
populated from the YTD chart in step 8. Note that the yellow cells are populated with 
test data.
11.	 Go to the Appearance properties of the Scorecard and click on the Text tab. 
Unselect the Target Profit and YTD vs Last YTD checkboxes. The reason is 
that we only want to see alert shapes on these cells and not the text value.

Appendix A
311
12.	Go to the Alerts properties of the Scorecard. Check the Target Profit and YTD vs 
Last YTD checkboxes. In both cases the Alert Values will be bound to cell O14 
of the State and Drilldown Display worksheet. In both the cases, make sure to 
have As Percent of Target selected. For Target Profit, bind it to cell P14 and 
for YTD vs Last YTD bind it to cell Q14. In the Alert Thresholds section, we want 
Min/70%/85%/Max for Target Profit. Set the alert threshold for the YTD vs Last YTD 
to Min/99.999%/100%/Max. 
The reason we have 99.999% is so that the yellow arrow is for 
anything that has YTD equal to Last YTD.

Real World Dashboard Case Studies
312
13.	Next we will complete the Trend Line Chart on the bottom right-hand side of the 
dashboard. Drag a Line Chart component onto the bottom right-hand side of the 
canvas.
14.	 Bind the Titles and Data Range to the appropriate section in the State and Drilldown 
Display worksheet. 
Note that the purple section is populated depending on whether 
a user selects Sales or Profit.
15.	Now that the display elements are in place, we'll move onto the Sales/Profit Radio 
selector. Drag a Radio Button selector onto the top left-hand side section of the 
canvas.
16.	 There are two sets of data bindings here. First, we will select Label as Insertion Type, 
and then bind the data to the selected label (Sales or Profit) cell B1. The data is 
found on columns A and B of the Control Sheet worksheet.

Appendix A
313
17.	 For the next data binding Map data column selection, select Column as the 
Insertion Type. Bind the Source Data to columns B and C.
18.	The final interactive component is the hidden State filter, which will select the 
appropriate data for the State and Product details. Insert a Combo Box selector onto 
the canvas and make sure it is underneath all of the backgrounds. To make sure it is 
underneath, right-click on the Combo Box selector on the Object Browser and select 
Send To Back.

Real World Dashboard Case Studies
314
19.	Now we will bind the data from the Product Data worksheet. The labels will be bound 
to column B, since we are collecting all rows that belong to a state when clicking on a 
state from the map. Select Filtered Rows as the Insertion Type and bind the Source 
Data to cells B2:R205. The destination cells will be the peach area in the State and 
Drilldown Display worksheet.
20.	Go to the Behavior section of the hidden filter and bind the Selected Item to the 
selected Map item on cell E1 from the Control Sheet worksheet.
21.	 Now that our dashboard is complete we want to improve the look a bit. As you can 
see, there are several layers of background objects that add depth to the dashboard 
components. Drag a variety of Background and Rectangle components onto the 
canvas and play around with the look until it becomes something that you desire. 

Appendix A
315
Please refer to the source code on the type of layering that we have 
accomplished with the Background and Rectangle components.
How it works...
In steps 1-3, we utilize what we learned in the recipe Using maps to select data 
of an area or country to set up our map display and data on the left-hand side of 
the dashboard. From our map selection, we then drive the right-hand side of the 
dashboard. 
Steps 4-5 make use of the recipe Displaying alerts on a map to display the different 
colored states on the map representing the amount of sales/profit each state 
produced.
In steps 6-8 we use what we learned in the recipes Adding a line chart to your 
dashboard and Drilling down from a chart, to create a YTD Sales/Profit chart that 
allows a user to drilldown from the data values to a particular product.
In steps 9-12, the recipes Using the scorecard component and Using alerts in a 
scorecard are used to show a product’s details and threshold for a selected state.
In steps 13-14, we simply build a Line Chart that takes the trend data from a selected 
product and state.
In steps 15-17, we use a Combo Selector component to select from two sets of data. 
The first set of data consists of the label Sales/Profit, which is important because 
other components in the dashboard drive off the destination of the Sales/Profit label. 
The second set of data contains the sales/profit data for the map object.
Steps 18-20 utilize what we learned in the Using Filtered Rows recipe to select the 
appropriate data from the Product Data worksheet. As you can see in the Product 
Data worksheet, we need to somehow group the states together into a selection. To 
accomplish this, a Filtered Rows selection is necessary.
The final steps consist of adding backgrounds and providing a uniform aligned look 
and feel that can be found in the Chapter 1, Staying in Control.

architects, and end users.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals should be

discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, contact us; one of our commissioning editors 
will get in touch with you.
