e-discovery (short for electronic discovery) but don’t know who to call, or 
even better, what to read. e-Discovery For Dummies is an end-to-end refer­
ence and tutorial written for litigators and jurists, corporate counsel and 
paralegals, information technology (IT) and human resources (HR) managers, 
executives and record librarians, and anyone who might file a lawsuit or be 
the recipient of one. For those not engaged in e-discovery now, the time is 
fast approaching when having a commanding knowledge of it is going to be 
vital to your career.
Who Should Read This Book?
e-Discovery For Dummies is for everyone needing an understanding of the 
e-discovery rules of procedure and the protections they provide, and how 
to position your case to be covered by those protections. IT, HR, records 
managers, and others who might be responsible for e-litigation readiness or 
electronic records management should start reading this book as soon as 
possible.
CPAs who provide forensic information and damage calculations for clients 
need to be aware of e-discovery issues, particularly the liability implications 
of metadata contained in client files. Inadvertent disclosure of metadata in 
client files could remove legal protections. For example, if a client’s metadata 
is disclosed accidentally, then it may enable opponents to use that metadata 
against the client’s interests. 
Insurance companies are enormously concerned and interested in e-discovery. 
Insurers are like the father of the bride — even though no one pays much 
attention to him at the event, he pays much of the bill. So insurance companies 
have one of the largest stakes in e-discovery. 
If you know nothing about e-discovery or want to sharpen your litigation 
strategy, this book’s for you.

About This Book
e-Discovery For Dummies is an introduction to the hottest legal issue. The 
e-discovery rules expand the definition of what’s discoverable to include 
electronically stored information (ESI), require parties to discuss ESI during 
initial meet-and-confer conferences, may provide a safe harbor against sanc­
tions for routine deletion of ESI, and may protect against a privilege waiver 
for inadvertent disclosure. 
The rulings and opinions of various judges provide invaluable lessons that 
you and your lawyers can learn from this book, much cheaper than learning 
through experience. We cover the Advisory Guidelines to better prepare you 
to understand the process of obtaining, protecting, and presenting ESI. You 
learn how Federal Rule of Evidence 502, enacted in 2008, provides relief for 
inadvertent disclosure of items privileged under the attorney-client relation­
ship or protected as work product. 
Every company and agency needs to be litigation-ready and know how to pro­
ceed when requesting or responding to e-discovery agreements. Preparing for 
litigation implies that all of these new data repositories must be included in a 
data and records retention policy and program. Security executives involved 
in litigation could be called upon to describe their company’s records retention 
policy and be knowledgeable of the systems used to manage their depart­
ment’s data. Lacking a credible program or failing to adhere to the policy is 
indefensible in court and might expose your company to legal risk.
It’s an honest presentation of the issues and challenges, strengths and weak­
nesses of e-discovery.
What You’re Not to Read
Depending on your background in law, criminal justice, investigative methods, 
or technology, you can skip the stuff you already know. If you’re the victim, 
the accused, the plaintiff, or the defendant, feel free to skip sections that 
don’t relate directly to your case or predicament.
Foolish Assumptions
We make a few conservative assumptions, even though we’re serious about 
issues and advice we offer. We assume that:

How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into seven parts. They take you through the basics 
of e-discovery, ESI, rules, advisories, and litigation readiness. They cover 
the phases from preservation through production. Specialty issues, such 
as e-discovery in large cases and small cases and computer forensics, are 
covered. For a more detailed overview of topics, check out the following 
sections.
Part I: Examining e-Discovery 
and ESI Essentials
The book starts by introducing you to the e-discovery laws that have 
changed the responsibilities of legal and information technology (IT) profes­
sionals. You read why every lawsuit and most civil cases can and will involve 
e-discovery and the accessibility of ESI (as well as ESI that’s not reasonably 
accessible).
You learn that most cases are settled as a result of e-discovery because that’s 
when both sides learn the strengths and weaknesses of their position relative 
to that of their opposition.
Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery 
and Professional Competence
This part gives you an in-depth understanding of the e-discovery amendments, 
The Sedona Conference advisory guidelines often used by the bench in set­
tling disputes, and the expected standards of legal competence and conduct. 
Although the Federal Rules and advisories guide e-discovery, the competency
of counsel turns them into a winning edge. We present the Electronic Discovery 
Reference Model (EDRM) as it relates to processes of preserving, collecting, 
processing, reviewing, and producing ESI.

e-Discovery For Dummies 
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, 
and Collecting ESI
In this part, we cover the first phases of e-discovery, namely the identification, 
preservation, and collection of ESI. These are the steps to take when a lawsuit 
is filed. You learn what to do when faced with an e-discovery request and the 
countdown to the meet and confer with opposing counsel within 99 days. 
We discuss the meet-and-confer conference in detail. Being prepared to nego­
tiate during this conference can make the difference between a quick settle­
ment and a prolonged battle. There are no re-negotiations or bailouts for bad 
agreements.
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, 
and Producing ESI
In the fourth part, we cover the next set of phases from processing of ESI 
through review, filtering, and the production of responsive, nonprivileged, 
redacted ESI. You read many examples of motions, mistakes, and monetary 
sanctions that could have been avoided. 
All ESI issues might arise during these phases, including metadata, privilege, 
work product, keyword searches, and filtering by keyword, concept, and 
custodian. This part details the review process, which is the most expensive 
phase in e-discovery.
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready
In this fifth part, we examine the admissibility and relevance rule of elec­
tronic evidence, and forensics methods to recover and preserve it. Rules of 
evidence are subject to judgment, as are the federal rules of civil procedure. 
This part also covers advanced e-discovery strategies and issues, some of 
which are the use of experts, sanctions, depositions, and cost-shifting. We 
explain methods to authenticate evidence in civil trials. One indisputable 
duty is to keep the chain of custody intact because you can’t repair tainted 
electronic evidence.

5
 Introduction
Part VI: Strategizing for 
e-Discovery Success
In the sixth part, you learn about archiving electronic records, which dif­
fers from data backups. We discuss electronic records management (ERM) 
that’s necessary to be ready to respond to a request for ESI. The focus shifts 
from internal to external. We discuss e-discovery from the perspective of the 
judges and their powers to encourage parties to practice good faith and dis­
suade gamesmanship.
For large-scale, high-stakes, or unusual cases, you learn the value of partnering 
with vendors or litigation services companies to augment your expertise. For 
small cases, ESI may be the most convincing witness. 
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has The Part of Tens, and we give you three of 
them. The first one covers the must-know rules. The second focuses on keep­
ing you up-to-date. The third one focuses on the courts and career-advancing 
lessons.
Glossary
We include an e-discovery dictionary of legal and technical terms used 
throughout this book.

Where to Go from Here
In this book, you find the basics of e-discovery rules, procedures, case law, and 
litigation readiness, but this is an exploding topic. You can use this book as a 
reference, how-to guide, and path to lifelong learning. Electronic discovery is 
not a passing phase. Electronic discovery case law is evolving. Litigants are 
sliding down the learning curve, which may significantly reduce time, costs, 
errors, and sanctions. When you know the basics and tactics, you have the 
foundation to expand your knowledge.

Part I
Examining 
e-Discovery and 
ESI Essentials

In this part . . .
T
his part presents e-discovery in digestible chunks so 
you understand the essentials of e-discovery at its 
simplest level. We explain e-discovery laws that have re-
written the responsibilities of legal and information tech­
nology (IT) professions in Chapter 1. Legal and IT — two 
groups most unlikely to speak a common language or 
operate at the same tempo — are most responsible for 
e-discovery success. Also in Chapter 1, you learn that all 
electronic content that we create, send, post, search, 
download, or store has a legal name: electronically stored 
information, or ESI. We cover why this ESI universe is sub­
ject to discovery and cite cases where failing to preserve 
and produce ESI cost litigants serious amounts of money 
and essentially gutted their cases. 
In Chapter 2, you learn why working with ESI is messy 
even under the best circumstances. You’re introduced to 
the relationship between the age of ESI and the ability to 
reach out and retrieve it from its storage media. ESI can 
be online, offline, gone, or somewhere in between. The 
ability to reach and retrieve ESI determines its accessibil­
ity, which in turn influences its discovery status from the 
perspective of judges (or the bench). You find out why it’s 
best to resolve your ESI disputes with the opposing side 
rather than turn those disputes over to the bench. Also in 
Chapter 2, we foreshadow the fate of enterprises unpre­
pared for e-discovery. You start to understand that invest­
ing in ESI retention and management tools to get into 
litigation-ready shape is much less risky than whining 
about why it’s too burdensome to respond to an ESI 
request. Chapter 3 continues these lessons.
Prelitigation best practices get you into a strong defensive 
position, as you read in Chapter 3. You learn one of the 
most crucial lessons — that most cases are settled as a 
result of e-discovery because it’s only then that both sides 
learn the strengths and weaknesses of the other’s case. 
You don’t go all in with no chance of winning, at least not 
more than once. When you do e-discovery right, you have 
a powerful offensive or defensive weapon.
“We used to say there’s e-discovery as if it was a subset of 
all discovery. But now there’s no other discovery.”
—Judge Shira A. Scheindlin (2009), 
e-discovery rock-star judge

Is a Burning Issue

eginning in 1938, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) have gov­
erned the discovery of evidence in lawsuits and other civil cases. 
Discovery is the investigative phase of a legal case when opponents size up 
what evidence is, or might be, available. During discovery, the parties in 
a dispute — the plaintiff (party bringing suit) and the defendant (the party 
being sued) — have the right to request any information in any format relevant 
to the case from their opponent. Each party has to respond with either the 
information or a really good reason why the information cannot be presented.
Despite several updates, FRCP remained largely limited to paper until 2006. 
Evidence, on the other hand, had gone electronic and onto hard drives of 
computers and handheld devices. To synchronize the legal system to the 
realities of the digital age when almost everything is e-mailed or viewed on 
an Internet-enabled device, electronic discovery (e-discovery) amendments 
to the FRCP were enacted on December 1, 2006. Put simply, changes to the 
FRCP mean that almost all discovery now involves e-discovery. 
In this chapter, you discover how e-discovery rules rocked the legal land­
scape by making electrically stored information (ESI) discoverable. You read 
why you must start thinking about e-discovery long before you’re involved in 
a legal action. Electronic discovery is an inescapable obligation (like paying 
taxes); you must be able to produce all relevant ESI on demand. To produce 
data and documents, you have to save them in such a way that you can find, 
open, and read them. You and your lawyers can expect consequences when 
stuff goes missing. Armed with this information, you then get familiar with 
the basic stages in the e-discovery process.

Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
Getting Thrust into the Biggest 
Change in the Litigation
In April 2006, the United States Supreme Court approved sweeping changes 
to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP). After getting Congress’s 
approval, the amended FRCP became law on December 1, 2006. These amended 
rules are aimed at one issue — the discovery of electronically stored information 
(ESI). ESI used as evidence is electronic evidence, or e-evidence. Despite their 
differences, the terms ESI and e-evidence are often used interchangeably.
As you can guess from the title, the discovery of anything electronic is called 
e-discovery. With most or all decisive evidence being electronic, you need to 
understand both the legal and technological dimensions of e-discovery — 
and depending on your job, you may just be competent in one or the other. 
We talk about the legal side in Chapter 4, which details the new FRCP. Many 
U.S. state laws are based on federal laws so there’s no escaping e-discovery 
rules. For a description of the federal rulemaking process, visit uscourts.
gov/rules/newrules3.html.
	
You can download a copy of the 166-page FRCP describing its 86 rules from 
the U.S. Courts’ Web site at www.uscourts.gov/rules/CV2008.pdf. If 
you’re new to the rules, you might hold off reading them until you’ve read 
Chapter 4 in this book.
Why did e-discovery rules, in effect, steamroll the litigation landscape? The 
short answer is that lawyers and litigants were unprepared to comply with 
this type and volume of discovery and all its complexities. Two reasons 
account for most of this lack of preparedness.
	
✓	Lawyers are not IT people. The huge majority of lawyers never had 
a course in IT (information technology) or e-discovery in their law 
schools. Electronic evidence lives in many places and forms that are 
tough to find, collect, store, and interpret without technical skills.
	
✓	Electronic discovery must be addressed when a lawsuit is filed. When 
litigation initiates, so does the e-discovery clock. Comparing Figure 1-1 to 
Figure 1-2, you see how the discovery phase of litigation has changed. Prior 
to December 2006, discovery was an afterthought. Most litigation doesn’t 
go to trial, so cases ended before discovery got started. Not anymore.
No matter the size of your case, you need to make sure your lawyer has a clear 
understanding of the technologies involved and knowledge of the e-discovery 
rules to meet and manage his e-discovery duties correctly. If your lawyer lacks 
the tech expertise and the experience to make e-discovery more efficient, you 
risk e-discovery going wrong; resulting in you getting sanctioned by the judge 
or maybe even losing your case.

The FRCP applies to every type of litigation. Class action lawsuits, complex 
corporate fraud, and employment cases (for example, discrimination, wrong­
ful termination, and harassment) involve e-discovery. Government investiga­
tions of fraud or improper conduct invariably dig into e-mail, instant messages, 
contact lists, and appointment calendars. In instances where a marriage 
is eroding, spouses might want to know and use what the other spouse is 
searching for on the Internet or texting.

New rules put electronic documents 
under a microscope
All computer systems, digital devices, and anything with a flash drive used by 
businesses, government agencies, health care and education institutions, and 
individuals that store electronic documents (word processing, spreadsheets, 
calendars, and presentations) are forms of ESI. Everything from terabyte-
sized databases to text messages (even Twitter messages, or tweets) may 
be discoverable (subject to discovery) and, therefore, reviewable by others. 
Contact lists on an iPhone, legacy data on backup tapes, instant messages on 
a BlackBerry, posts on MySpace, and GPS and EZ-Pass records may be part of 
the ESI universe.

We use “may be” to temper our statements because privileged and confidential 
content may create exceptions to the rules. You find out about exceptions to 
the rules, and conditions that cancel (legally, waive) those exceptions, in 
Chapters 4 and 10.
Here’s how you should go about finding ESI prior to a trial.
	
1.	Conduct an initial search.
	
	 Search data stores, often asking for help from data owners or IT experts, 
to identify documents, e-mails, spreadsheets, financial records, or other 
ESI that have been requested. Full-text searching is one of the basic 
tools used to find documents. Full-text and keyword searching are dis­
cussed in Chapter 9. You’ll store all documents in a database.
	
2.	Perform a pre-production review.
	
	 Review all documents by hand, through a computer review, or most 
likely using both methods to verify their relevance and to exclude dupli­
cate, privileged, confidential, and irrelevant content. Best practices and 
pitfalls of pre-production review are covered in Chapter 9.
	
3.	Perform a post-production review.
	
	 You hand over the ESI to your opposing party so they can review it. In 
some cases, the court may appoint a Special Master, or you and your 
opponent may agree to have a neutral expert review the ES, or you may 
hire your own expert. A Special Master is a neutral lawyer with technical 
expertise or an IT expert appointed by the court to manage and resolve 
e-discovery disputes in such areas as forms of production, keywords, 
and protocols. 
	
During 2009, e-discovery costs amounted to 90 percent of a litigation budget 
with a majority of the costs associated with the review of ESI. You can take 
a big bite out of ESI costs by sticking to a disciplined approach to electronic 
records management in order to reduce the volume of ESI to review. For exam­
ple, by requiring users to delete personal e-mail and disposing of electronic 
records that no longer need to be retained, there’s a lot less ESI to collect, 
review, and produce. 
New rules and case law expand 
professional responsibilities
Federal rules and case law pertaining to both e-discovery and e-evidence 
have added technological competence and ESI management to professional 

13
 Chapter 1: Knowing Why e-Discovery Is a Burning Issue
responsibilities. Case law is the body of law or precedents created by judges’ 
written opinions and decisions. Rules are interpreted in case law. That is, what 
the rules are interpreted to mean are determined by judges’ opinions, which 
create case law.
For example, case law on how effectively your keyword search methodology 
has met its discovery obligations were created by the opinions of judges in 
three cases: USA v. O’Keefe (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2008), Equity Analytics v. Lundin 
(D.D.C. Mar. 7, 2008), and Victor Stanley, Inc. v. Creative Pipe, Inc. (D. Md. May 
29, 2008). The case law warns that a lawyer’s failure to search an e-discovery 
database competently will lead to a bad outcome. Subsequent cases involving 
disputes over keyword or text searching often refer to those decisions.
	
You can find the text of significant e-discovery opinions using the federal 
court system’s PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) at http://
pacer.psc.uscourts.gov. There’s a small fee for accessing certain records.
Groundbreaking e-discovery case law stemmed from five opinions in Zubulake 
v. U.B.S. Warburg. Zubulake was an employment discrimination case in the 
Southern District of New York that resulted in opinions that are still referred 
to as the gold standard in e-discovery. You find out about the Zubulake 
opinions in Chapter 4.
	
FRCP requires you to quickly find ESI when required by the court. Waiting 
until you’re facing an e-discovery request (actually, it’s a demand) to start pre­
paring for one can lead to severe sanctions. 
Imagine waiting until a fire has started to install a sprinkler system, develop 
evacuation plans, or conduct fire drills. Inarguably, the new rules and case 
law have expanded the job descriptions of managers, lawyers, paralegals, liti­
gation supporters, IT administrators, and data custodians.
Your attorneys and paralegals need to be IT proficient. Your attorneys need 
to know what ESI to request and to be able to defend their requests when 
vigorously challenged by the opposition. Attorneys also need to under­
stand your IT infrastructure in order to comply with the request, prevent 
the destruction of evidentiary ESI (see the nearby sidebar about AMD and 
Intel), and keep a record of searches that you’ve conducted to validate the 
effectiveness of your searches. Your entire IT department must cooperate 
with your legal team. You must be able to identify, preserve, and collect ESI. 
With so much information potentially subject to an e-discovery order, your 
entire legal team — IT professionals and lawyers — must understand both IT 
and the law so you inadvertently or deliberately don’t delete ESI that you’re 
required to preserve.

Being unprepared is expensive. An unprepared manufacturing company spent 
$800,000 filtering its unmanaged e-mail system in response to an e-discovery 
request. Roughly 88 percent of their e-mails were irrelevant to the litigation 
and weren’t produced.
Distinguishing Electronic Documents 
from Paper Documents
When you think of new technology (such as electronic documents) in terms 
of older technology (circa paper), you don’t appreciate its distinctive qualities
and capabilities. Legend has it that when electricity was invented and electri­
cal lights replaced gas lamps in 1879, people would change their light bulbs 
quickly so electricity wouldn’t leak out of the socket. Warning signs were 
posted that read “This room is equipped with Edison Electric Light. Do not 
attempt to light with match. Simply turn key on wall by the door.” In fine 
Biggest e-discovery case catches Intel unprepared
In 2005, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 
brought a lawsuit against its archrival Intel for 
alleged anticompetitive practices in the chip­
maker market. Both parties recognized that they 
faced the largest e-discovery ever. Estimates of 
production were roughly “a pile 137 miles high.”
The Special Master appointed by the court to 
hear evidence from both AMD and Intel rec­
ommended that Intel be compelled to produce 
documents that it had declined to submit. In 
March 2007, Judge Joseph A. Farnan, Jr. gave 
Intel 30 days to recover more than 1,000 e-mails 
that it should have but did not preserve.
Intel faced several problems. Its e-mail system 
running on Microsoft Exchange servers auto­
matically purged employee e-mail every 35 
days and senior executives’ e-mail every 60 
days. Intel used nonindexed backup tapes 
designed for disaster recovery that were not 
suited for e-discovery. Trying to find all of the 
requested e-mail messages that contained 
specific keywords took a staggering amount 
of time because each backup tape had to be 
mounted to restore the contents in order to get 
them into shape to be searched and reviewed. 
In a March 5, 2007 letter to Judge Farnan, 
Intel’s lawyer advised the court and AMD of its 
extensive and expensive remediation efforts to 
find and recover lost e-mails. For e-mails sent 
by employees that hadn’t been preserved as 
they should have, Intel planned to locate them 
from the e-mail in-boxes of employees who’d 
received them. The letter also stated: 
“the overall scope of the e-mails and docu­
ments Intel will be producing is sweeping in 
breadth and magnitude — and will encompass 
the equivalent of tens of millions of pages of 
material from many hundreds of employees 
with overlapping involvement in communica­
tions, both internal and external.”
The court scheduled the AMD v. Intel case for 
trial in February 2010.

 Chapter 1: Knowing Why e-Discovery Is a Burning Issue
print at the bottom of the signs read “The use of electricity for lighting is in 
no way harmful to health, nor does it affect the soundness of sleep.”
The key point is that a technological understanding of electronic documents, 
devices, and how they are managed is important — so that you don’t take a 
match to them out of ignorance. A helpful approach is to start by comparing 
and contrasting characteristics of ESI and paper, which we do in the following 
sections.
	
Research firm Gartner found that nearly 90 percent of U.S. companies with 
revenue exceeding $1 billion are facing an average of 147 lawsuits at any given 
time, and that the average cost to defend a corporate lawsuit exceeds $1.5 
million per case.
ESI has more volume
The amount of ESI created per person is measured in megabytes (MB) — 
roughly 800MB per year. One MB equals 1,048,576 (or 220) bytes, which would 
hold the content of a medium-sized novel. A Fortune 1000 pharmaceutical 
company with more than 70,000 employees archives 35 terabytes (TB) of new 
e-mail data every year. One TB is roughly 1.1 trillion bytes. The trivia question 
is, “How many pages of data equal one terabyte?” The answer is 75 million 
pages. Of the 60 billion e-mails sent worldwide on a daily basis, 25 billion are 
business-related. 
Clearly, the volume of ESI is tough to fathom. Unlike paper, the volume of ESI 
multiplies because ESI replicates itself. When you send e-mail, a copy goes into 
your sent mail folder and another arrives in each of the receivers’ inboxes, 
which might get stored on e-mail servers or archived. With paper documents, 
creating multiple copies requires more time and effort. 
ESI is more complex
Electronic documents provide more recordkeeping information than a paper 
copy because metadata are embedded within it. Metadata is essentially the 
history of a document written with invisible ink. Every comment, edit, itera­
tion of a document is hidden within that document, chronicling its life. There 
is also embedded data frequently stored with an ESI document, such as for­
mulas in spreadsheets. Microsoft Office automatically embeds many different 
types of metadata in word processing, spreadsheet, and other applications. 
Examples of metadata are
	
✓	Title, subject, and author
	
✓	Location where the file is saved

16
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
	
✓	Dates and precise times when the document was created, accessed, 
modified, and printed
	
✓	Comments, revision number, total editing time, and the template used to 
create it
Metadata is discoverable when needed or relevant to a matter at hand. For 
example, you can use this information when there’s a question of when a 
document was created or downloaded, whether it was modified, or backdated. 
Metadata may help authenticate a document, or establish facts material to a 
dispute, such as when a file was created or accessed, or when an e-mail 
message was sent.
Seeking out and viewing metadata embedded in a document is mining the 
document. Many e-discovery disputes are caused by, or because of, meta­
data. Those disputes are so significant they’ve led to case law. 
Williams v. Sprint is a landmark case concerning metadata. It established the 
standard that the producing party should produce electronic documents 
with their metadata intact.
By mining a document, your attorney can view revisions made to the docu­
ment, comments added by other users who reviewed the document, and 
whether it was drafted from a template. The disclosure of metadata can lead 
to the disclosure of client confidences and secrets, litigation strategy, edito­
rial comments, legal issues raised by the client, and other confidential infor­
mation. See Chapter 10 for explanations of these issues.
ESI is more fragile
Electronic documents are much easier to alter than paper documents with­
out leaving a visible sign of the alteration. The sender of e-mail messages can 
spoof, or fake, the sender’s identity — a spammer’s tool of the trade. Data and 
files can be modified deliberately in numerous ways that may be detectable 
only with computer forensic techniques. We discuss recovering deleted data 
in Chapter 2. (For more computer forensics techniques, check out Computer 
Forensics For Dummies, by Linda Volonino and Reynaldo Anzaldua.)
Files can become corrupted. Hard drives crash. Users accidentally or delib­
erately can overwrite a file by saving a new file with the same filename as an 
existing one. Backup tapes get re-used, lost, stolen, or may break or get cor­
rupted. Auto-delete policies may delete e-mails after a certain amount of time, 
even without an intentional action to delete them.
Figure 1-3 contrasts how paper and ESI are destroyed or altered and how 
they are preserved. Because ESI exists only on some storage media and 
that media may be overwritten, corrupted, or otherwise be unreadable, 

17
 Chapter 1: Knowing Why e-Discovery Is a Burning Issue
you should take affirmative steps to preserve it. Absent deliberate action to 
preserve the ESI, the expectation is that it will be destroyed or altered. The 
courts understand this principle. So must you.

ESI is harder to delete
Electronic documents are much more difficult to dispose of than paper docu­
ments even though they’re fragile. The fragility/persistence paradox causes 
a lot of confusion. Jeff Rothenberg, a senior computer scientist at RAND, cap­
tured the paradox by pointing out humorously that “digital information lasts 
forever, or five years — whichever comes first.” RAND (www.rand.org) is 
a nonprofit institution whose mission is to conduct research and analysis to 
help improve policy and decision-making.
For example, changing the data or formula in a cell of an Excel spreadsheet 
could be a destructive change (no traces of the change) if there are no other 
copies of that file or tracking changes is turned off. A destructive change or 
update is one that destroys the prior contents beyond recovery or detection. 
If you instead delete the Excel file from a hard drive and take the extra step of 
deleting it from your Recycle Bin, the entire file will remain intact in the same 
position on the drive unless it is overwritten. You read more about what 
happens when a file is deleted in Chapter 2. Computer forensics software 
could recover that file along with information about when it was deleted. 
Deleting documents is futile if they were saved to a server, backed up, or 
e-mailed. Misunderstanding persistence may lead to the discovery of informa­
tion that was never intended to be retained or that no one knew existed.
There’s also the auto-recover or auto-save feature found in software programs 
that prevents data loss by automatically creating a backup copy of any cur­
rently open document every few minutes or other time interval. This so-called 
replicant data is stored on the hard drive as separate documents. Because they 
may not be deleted when the application program (such as Word) closes, they 
persist as copies of documents long since changed or deleted.

18
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
ESI is more software and 
hardware dependent
Data is unreadable or meaningless when separated from its original or native 
software environment. You need software to open and view a file correctly. 
If you have five-and-a-quarter inch floppy disks and no computer with that 
drive, you cannot get at those files. If you don’t have the correct software ver­
sion, you can’t open the file. Files stored on floppy disks, Zip drives, or other 
outdated media can’t be accessed without hardware that can read them. If 
information has been transferred to backup tape, it may be difficult to restore 
the information because of technology upgrades or deterioration of the tape. 
When you change accounting software applications, for instance, you may 
not be able to access legacy (old) data years afterward.
Viewing the Litigation Process 
from 1,000 Feet
When you get involved in the litigation process, some milestones you can be 
involved with are shown in Figure 1-4. Notice the rather tight timeline and 
the two deadlines, which are specified by the amended FRCP. Total elapsed 
time from when the complaint is served (or lawsuit filed) until your lawyer 
submits your e-discovery plan to the court is only 120 days. The trial may be 
scheduled far into the future, which happened with AMD v. Intel. AMD filed 
the complaint in 2005; the trial is scheduled for 2010.

 Chapter 1: Knowing Why e-Discovery Is a Burning Issue
Although the purpose of the new rules is to provide early structure, unifor­
mity, and predictability to the litigation process, the reality is that right from 
Day 1 of a lawsuit, you must be ready to start evaluating with your IT team 
and legal counsel where you stand in terms of your ESI.
Here are the deadlines you need to observe:
	
✓	Time minus zero: Duty to preserve. You need to take affirmative action — 
active and timely measures — to prevent the destruction or alteration of 
what might be relevant e-evidence. This duty generally begins when you 
reasonably anticipate a legal action. That’s a tough duty to comply with. 
Clairvoyance would be helpful because the scope of what needs to be 
preserved and when are not clear.
	
	Accept that it’s difficult under the best of circumstances to know when 
your duty to preserve has triggered or what you need to preserve. Consult 
with your in-house counsel on when your duty to preserve ESI kicks in.
	
✓	Day 1: Complaint served. You’re on solid ground here because there’s 
no mistaking that a lawsuit is in play. This action starts a clock that 
counts off days.
	
✓	By Day 99: Meet-and-confer session. You must participate in a meet-and-
confer session during which you cooperate with your opponent to nego­
tiate an e-discovery plan. This type of cooperation is new and also a bit 
of a shock to the legal system that’s used to being adversarial. The list of 
topics to negotiate includes the following:
 
• Any issues relating to preserving discoverable ESI
 
• Any issues relating to search, disclosure, or discovery of ESI
 
• Format in which ESI should be produced
 
• Scope of ESI holdings
 
• Estimated costs in terms of difficulty, risk, time, and money of pro­
ducing the ESI
	
✓	By Day 120: Scheduling conference. A scheduling conference is a hear­
ing attended by all attorneys — yours and your opponents — and the 
judge to schedule certain dates and deadlines for the case. This event is 
generally the first time you come before the court. 
By forcing these events early on in a case, by way of the FRCP amendments 
and case law, you really have no choice but to be ready to move forward with 
e-discovery at the start of a case. 

20
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
Examining e-Discovery Processes
When you’re involved in the e-discovery process, regardless of the type of case 
or investigation, you need to perform certain functions and meet requirements. 
Expect that none of the requirements is easy or cheap (in terms of time or 
money). On the plus side, performing them correctly saves time, effort, 
disruption, and stress. You face the following e-discovery functions.
Creating and retaining electronic records
Getting ready for e-discovery requires you being proactive. A standard used 
to evaluate proactive readiness is reasonableness. Your ability to demon­
strate reasonableness starts with having established control over data, docu­
ments, and other electronic records. The base on which e-discovery is built 
is electronic records management (ERM). ERM is known by other names, 
such as records and information management, or RIM.
Here’s how to set up an electronics rights management system:
	
1.	 Develop an electronic record retention policy.
	
	 In light of litigation trends and declining storage costs, you can fall into 
the trap of believing that it’s wise to save generously. Developing a keep-
it-all retention policy is not the best approach because it focuses on the 
wrong factor — storage costs. 
	
	 You may think the FRCP requires you to save everything or save all 
e-mails. Regulated industries or certain types of companies, such as 
those in the financial, healthcare, and pharmaceutical sectors, have gov­
ernment regulations in place such as save all communications for seven 
years. But absent such regulation, the Supreme Court has indicated that 
you can set your own reasonable retention policy.
	
	 Even if storage is cheap, management is costly. Good ERM is expensive 
because of the management, not the storage. As you read in Chapters 2
and 3, you need to keep your eye on the costs of reviewing electronic 
records to identify responsive ones. Define what is essential and needed 
as opposed to saving everything.
	
	 Without an enforceable retention program and a secure, auditable archive 
and electronic records management solution, the costs associated with 
e-discovery are daunting, as you read in the AMD v Intel case.
	
2.	 Implement the electronic records retention policy.
	
	 Even your best electronic records retention policy is of little use 
if employees don’t implement it in a correct and uniform manner. 
Everyone who deals with records — employees, contract workers, 

21
 Chapter 1: Knowing Why e-Discovery Is a Burning Issue
interns, and vendors — must receive sufficient and proper training on 
the policy. You need to document the training in detail.
	
3.	 Monitor compliance with the policy.
	
	 Most likely, your retention program is partially automated and partially 
manual because end users need to categorize their records. To verify 
that retention requirements continue to be met, you have to monitor 
compliance.
	
4.	 Destroy electronic records at the end of retention periods.
	
	 When electronic records no longer need to be retained, you need a 
secure way to destroy them.
	
5.	Change policies when you reasonably foresee litigation. 
	
	 As soon as you reasonably expect to be involved in litigation, you 
must immediately set aside your ordinary electronic record retention 
program and implement a more demanding policy. This litigation-hold 
policy is critical, as you read in Part III. The litigation-hold policy must 
comply with the special requirements established at the meet-and-
confer session and the scheduling conference.
	
No “model” electronic records retention program fits all. You should base 
your retention program on a case-by-case examination of your business, the 
legal and regulatory requirements of your industry and jurisdiction, and what 
use your company is likely to make of the documents, both for business and 
litigation purposes.
Identifying, preserving, and collecting 
data relevant to a legal matter
Assuming that electronic records are managed properly, the next step when 
facing litigation is to identify the relevant records, preserve them so they 
cannot be altered, and collect them for further review.
	
Methods used to identify relevant ESI may have been agreed to at the meet and 
confer or scheduling conference — although the duty to identify and preserve 
did start before this conference, when litigation was reasonably anticipated. If 
the meet and confer or scheduling conference has already happened, ask your 
lawyer whether an agreement is in place.
You have to preserve the ESI until it’s needed. Preservation takes many 
forms, as discussed in Chapters 2 and 7. One of your difficulties at this stage 
is preserving data that is in use by the business. A lot of attention in case law 
has focused on data that is not reasonably accessible (see Chapters 2 and 3). 
Equally challenging is preserving live data because you cannot simply hand 
over a backup tape.

The standard for duty to preserve comes from the opinion of District Court 
Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, from the Southern District of New York, in Zubulake 
v. UBS Warburg LLC, 220 F.R.D. 212 (S.D.N.Y., Oct. 22, 2003). That case is 
referred to as Zubulake IV because it was the fourth in a series of what are 
called the Zubulake decisions.
Processing and filtering 
to remove the excess
As with every stage in the e-discovery process, there are strategies and best 
practices for the processing and filtering of ESI. After preserving and collect­
ing the ESI, you’ll confront the costly tasks of processing and reviewing the 
data for responding to the investigation, claim, or litigation.
Determining what to process is a balancing act of costs and risks. Gartner 
estimates the cost of reviewing 1GB for e-discovery is $18,750. Clearly, costs 
are reduced by reducing the volume to be filtered. Risks are increased by 
reducing the amount of ESI to process because relevant e-evidence might be 
excluded. Breaching e-discovery obligations can result in sanctions or worse 
even if processing and filtering were done in good faith. In Chapter 9, we 
explain this critical stage in detail.
Reviewing and analyzing for privilege
Confidential conversations and communications that are protected by law 
from being used as evidence or revealed to others are referred to as privileged. 
Examples of privilege are conversations or letters between a person and an 
attorney (attorney-client privilege), therapist, physician, priest, minister, or 
spouse. Privilege is a major source of argument between opposing lawyers. 
Unless there’s an exception, privileged ESI is not discoverable. There are an 
almost interminable number of exceptions to privilege. 
You must review all ESI to identify what is and is not privileged. This stage 
may be the most expensive depending on the stakes of the case. ESI that you 
must review visually is much more costly than a coarser review using soft­
ware for the same volume of ESI.
We talk more about privilege in Chapter 10.

23
 Chapter 1: Knowing Why e-Discovery Is a Burning Issue
Producing what’s required
You start with the universe of ESI, filter out what’s irrelevant, duplicated, or 
privileged, and then have the pool of ESI to produce. Before producing the ESI, 
you may need to do additional reviews. 
If form of production was not specified by the requesting party at the meet-
and-confer session, you might have some options. Producing ESI in native 
format is common because it’s cheaper than having a forensics image created. 
With native production, if it existed as a .docx file, you produce it as a .docx 
file. Turn to Chapters 11 and 13 for more info about how to produce ESI.
Complications emerge when you have documents with attachments, for 
example, e-mail messages with attachments or project management files with 
attached resource files. Other complications are identified in Chapter 10.
FRCP Rule 34(b)(ii) allows you to produce ESI in a form or forms in which you 
ordinarily maintain it. Other reasonably usable forms may also be acceptable.
There are pros and cons concerning form of production. When balancing 
production risks and costs, keep in mind that the form of production most 
likely must include the metadata.
Clawing back what sneaked out
If ESI is produced that should not have been, a situation known as inadvertent 
disclosure, you can request its return via a clawback agreement. Revealing the 
content of your privileged communications or documents to your opponent 
is suboptimal because you can’t take back what they’ve learned about you. 
Despite this downside, clawbacks are not unusual. When review or process­
ing is not done thoroughly, you’ll produce ESI that you shouldn’t have. The 
consequences for not producing on schedule because the review is incom­
plete may be worse than the risks associated with clawback.
Clawback agreements may be discussed during the meet-and-confer session. 
Despite any agreements, numerous conditions apply to clawbacks. Courts 
might have to decide whether the producing party has met those clawback 
conditions.
We talk more about clawback agreements in Chapter 10.

24
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
Presenting at trial
Judges have little to no patience with lawyers who appear before them and 
don’t understand their ESI or the ESI of the opposing side. The same applies 
to you if you’re called upon to testify on behalf of your company’s ESI reten­
tion policies, storage locations, or other e-discovery issues in court. No one 
can operate effectively in the courtroom without understanding e-evidence, 
where ESI is created and stored, how to collect and review it, how to recover 
it in a forensically sound manner, and how to have it admitted into evidence 
at trial. Chapter 5 discusses the professional competence and conduct of 
your lawyer.
You want to make sure that your lawyer and all your company’s witnesses 
are armed with the knowledge to competently and confidently testify in 
court. Make time for these lessons. When your lawyers asks for information, 
be sure to prepare reports and diagrams that non-technical people (the judge 
or members of the jury) can understand.

L
itigation is complex, expensive, disruptive, and risky — issues well-
known to those in information technology (IT). Litigation costs of the 
Fortune 500 firms in 2006 — the year that e-discovery amendments to the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) went into effect — were an estimated 
$210 billion, or a hefty 33 percent of after-tax profits. Losers can be facing a 
multimillion dollar price tag. As you read in this chapter, being prepared for 
litigation has its rewards, and cashing in on them requires understanding 
electronically stored information (ESI). For example, your company may be 
pressured into settling the case, regardless of its merits, because of the inability 
to find, or the cost of finding, necessary documents or e-mail messages.
ESI is at the core of e-discovery responsibilities — whether it’s understanding 
your computer systems, collecting or preserving ESI, preparing for depositions, 
or not getting outsmarted by the opposing party. In this chapter, you get up 
to speed on ESI language as it’s defined by noteworthy court opinions and 
the rules. A group of judges, through their mini-landmark decisions, have 
spearheaded efforts to define and interpret ESI standards and terminology.
Knowing how ESI storage affects the ease of its discovery is your starting point 
when preparing electronic records retention plans and prelitigation readiness 
strategies. Storage can be active, near active, offline, or archived. If you have 

26
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
an understanding of IT and ESI terminology and the relationship between ESI 
and litigation, you’re ready to negotiate, persuade, request, and defend.
Spotting the ESI in the Game Plan
Think of cases and their investigations as competitions between players on 
opposing full-contact sports teams. Both sides want to gain access or block 
access to evidence to help them win. Competition can resemble the fierceness 
of a Stanley Cup playoff, where the goalie’s purpose is to block access to the 
net while the opposing team fights to gain access to it.
We look at the issues in the fight over the accessibility of ESI. Specifically, in 
this chapter you find out about these types of technology-related disputes:
	
✓	Whether ESI is or is not subject to discovery
	
✓	Whether ESI is reasonably accessible and recoverable
	
✓	Whether all requested and responsive ESI has been turned over
	
✓	Who will pay to produce
When your team gets into disputes with your opposing party, everybody’s 
costs increase. Why? If disputes hit an impasse, the dispute may get pushed 
to the judge for resolution. To avoid having the judge serve as referee, the 
rules reward cooperation and punish anything less. The key to cooperation 
and cost-containment is having a thorough understanding the ESI terminol­
ogy. You can see its importance by looking at what’s discussed and debated 
at the meet-and-confer conference:
	
✓	What ESI is available
	
✓	Places where ESI resides
	
✓	Difficulty producing the ESI
	
✓	Which formats the ESI will be produced in
	
✓	Estimated cost of production
Your job is to provide your legal team with this information so that they can 
negotiate from a position of strength. Raw (unrefined) ESI requests increase 
e-discovery costs and waste the court’s time, and can cast doubt on your 
lawyer’s ESI IQ. A judge may be more willing to negotiate or exercise leniency 
with e-discovery obligations if you’re knowledgeable and honest and don’t 
try to hide or destroy evidence. If a judge believes that you don’t understand 
ESI or don’t want to follow e-discovery rules, he may naturally be impatient 
and more demanding.

27
 Chapter 2: Taking a Close Look at Electronically Stored Information (ESI)
Viewing the Life of Electronic 
Information
Your company’s electronic records have a life span. Ideally, you have an elec­
tronic records management (ERM) plan in place, which includes keeping all 
electronic records from the time of creation (or receipt) until their required 
retention period or their value expires, whichever is later.
	
You must preserve electronic records relevant to current or reasonably fore­
seeable litigation regardless of whether its retention period has passed or you 
feel it’s no longer of value. At least, that’s what’s supposed to happen. You can 
check out methods to preserve electronic records in Chapters 8, 13, and 14.
Accounting for age
Electronically stored information ages, and it doesn’t age well. ESI becomes 
less accessible as it gets older. As accessibility decreases, the costs of find­
ing, recovering, and getting it into readable shape increase quickly. This 
predicament is recognized in Federal Rule 26 (see Chapter 4), which provides 
protection from excessive or expensive e-discovery requests, except when a 
party doesn’t deserve that protection. As an electronic record ages, how and 
where you store it changes, too. Electronic records are kind of like clothes. 
Best to resolve disputes before they 
end up on the bench
Courts don’t accept ignorance (such as “the 
request is too vague”) or being unprepared (“I 
can’t find it”) as an excuse for not producing 
ESI relevant to a lawsuit. That would be like 
telling the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that 
you didn’t pay your taxes because its direc­
tions were too vague or you couldn’t find your 
receipts. There’s no good outcome. In Johnson 
v. Kraft Foods N. A., defendants objected to 
the terms databases, record layout, and data 
dictionaries, claiming they were vague and 
ambiguous, even though the plaintiff had 
provided definitions of those terms. Not per­
suaded by their excuses, the judge overruled 
their objection on the grounds that counsel 
could and should have known their meanings. 
Wasting a judge’s time with obvious lies about 
ESI is a sign of bad faith that may easily put you 
on the bad side of the court, where you might 
just stay.

28
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
Items you wear often are stored in the easiest-to-reach closets. This quick-
reach storage space is at a premium, so it’s used only for the most active 
clothes. Hobby or seasonal items that are worn less often, such as fishing, 
golfing, snowboarding, or hunting gear, are kept somewhere in your home 
but not with active clothes. Clothing that’s out of style or no longer fits may 
be packed up and moved to the crawl space in the attic, where it awaits the 
unlikely event that a retro look becomes popular or a diet plan works. The 
latter group consists of items you never really expect to wear again, but 
you’re also not ready to get rid of. At the extreme, items may be donated, 
converted to rags, or thrown out. The same sort of organization that you use 
for clothing happens with ESI.
Computer data storage, or simply storage or memory, refers to devices and 
recording media that retain ESI for some interval of time for retrieval later. 
Storage systems are inevitable for computing. All computing platforms, from 
handheld devices to super computers, use storage systems for storing data 
temporarily or permanently. There are three types of basic storage types and 
their corresponding degree of accessibility, including the following:
	
✓	Online: Online in this context means that you have immediate (direct) 
access to the files. Files saved to your hard drive are online because 
when you click a file’s icon, the file opens immediately. Even files that 
you can’t find on your laptop (perhaps because you didn’t organize 
them intelligently) still fall under the heading of online.
	
	Online media are random-access media. Random access, also known as 
direct access, simply means that you can access a stored file directly 
regardless of its location on the storage medium, as shown in Figure 2-1. 
Sequential access is the opposite of random access because files are 
accessed in the order of their storage. Because they’re sequential, if you 
want to read any particular file or block of data stored on tape, you must 
read the tape from the beginning, as with any type of tape recorder. See 
Table 2-1 for a comparison of random and sequential storage and access.

 Chapter 2: Taking a Close Look at Electronically Stored Information (ESI)
	
✓	Near-line: Near-line is a contraction of near-online. Near-line storage is 
removable media, such as DVDs, CDs, or flash drives, that store files 
randomly. When you use near-line storage, the files are available to you 
in a short period, such as within a few minutes. ESI is reasonably acces­
sible because you can pop in a DVD or flash drive and quickly get 
access to its contents. Like online, near-line storage allows for
random access to the ESI.
	
✓	Offline: ESI that’s offline isn’t readily available. With offline storage, you 
typically store files on magnetic tape that requires restoration in order 
to be read. The tapes themselves are transferred to another location for 
physical storage. Magnetic tape is a sequential storage medium and is 
often used as backup for disaster recovery situations.

The time it takes to find a specific file depends on whether the storage is 
sequential or random.
Tracking the rise and fall of an e-mail
To put the idea of the life of ESI into practice, take a look at the life of one of 
the most popular types: e-mail. As much as 70 percent of all company infor­
mation is contained in or attached to e-mail. The life of a work-related e-mail 
from a client may progress as follows:
	
✓	You receive an e-mail in your inbox. After reading it, you move it into 
your Client folder. At this point, the message is online, residing on your 
company’s e-mail server.

30
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
	
✓	After 21 days, the e-mail is automatically backed up to less-expensive 
tape storage, removing traces of its existence from the e-mail server.
	
✓	After 365 days, the e-mail is marked for destruction according to the 
company’s record retention policy. ESI that’s marked, but not overwritten, 
continues to exist as residual data.
	
✓	On day 390, the actual destruction of the e-mail occurs when the backup 
tape is reused, overwriting the information that was marked for 
destruction.
ESI transitions through several storage media to make room for new and 
incoming ESI. Your e-mail can be anywhere in its life span when an e-discovery 
request calls for it. The ease with which you can locate it depends on where 
it is. Stated another way, the burden associated with locating that e-mail is
	
✓	Lowest when the e-mail is stored on the e-mail server (a server is 
a hard drive)
	
✓	Highest when the e-mail has been moved to backup media that’s offline
	
✓	A moot point when it has been destroyed through the overwrite process
	
FRCP and Federal Rules of Evidence are general guidelines, not detailed 
processes. So it’s up to the judges to determine whether ESI is reasonably 
accessible. Judges recognize that e-discovery burdens and costs depend on 
the ESI’s accessibility, which changes as it ages. The accessibility of ESI is 
one of the reasons why the meet-and-confer conference happens early in the 
litigation. You want to catch the ESI in its earliest stage and preserve it from 
destruction — assuming, of course, it hasn’t already reached that state.
	
Courts are becoming increasingly stern with both requesting and producing 
parties who don’t prepare for the meet-and-confer conference and who then 
must revise agreements they’ve made. Preparation includes preserving all 
potentially relevant ESI. If you don’t, you might get rebuked by the judge, and 
when you lose the judge’s trust, you won’t easily get it back.
Understanding Zubulake I
One of the earliest e-discovery case laws created a way to approach the 
accessibility issue that’s discussed in the preceding section. The case, 
Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC (S.D.N.Y. 2003), is referred to as Zubulake I. 
UBS, the defendant, is a financial advisory and securities business.
The complications that can come up in handling ESI became clear in 2004, 
when U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin wrote a series of influential opin­
ions in Zubulake. Five separate rulings and hundreds of pages of analysis 
went into

31
 Chapter 2: Taking a Close Look at Electronically Stored Information (ESI)
	
✓	Figuring out what ESI is discoverable
	
✓	Determining how the cost of retrieving, copying, and distributing 
electronic records should be shared by the parties
	
✓	Deciding whether sanctions should be imposed for failing to produce 
requested ESI
The case was so influential that it was partially written into the FRCP amend­
ments in 2006. Because of the importance of the first Zubulake case, under­
standing the nature of the e-discovery dispute is helpful.
Zubulake was an employment (gender) discrimination case filed in 2003 by 
Laura Zubulake, who was an equities trader at UBS. After the lawsuit was 
filed, UBS objected to Laura’s request for responsive e-mails from August 
1999 when she was hired through October 2001 when she was fired. She 
requested all e-mails sent by or between UBS employees concerning her. 
Archived e-mails existed only on backup tapes and optical drives.
According to Christopher Behny, who was deposed to explain UBS’s e-mail 
retention policies, all e-mails sent or received by UBS employees were stored 
on backup tapes. UBS’s automated backup program created a snapshot of all 
e-mails on a given server at the time the backup was made. Of the many ESI 
issues, several of them are pointed out here:
	
✓	UBS had redundant e-mail backup and preservation protocols. E-mails 
were backed up on backup tapes and on optical disks.
 
• A copy of all e-mails that UBS traders sent to or received from 
external sources was simultaneously written onto optical disks. 
Optical disks are neither erasable nor rewritable, so they couldn’t 
be overwritten.
 
• Internal e-mails were stored on the tape backup system but not on 
the optical system.
 
• UBS had retained each optical disk used since the system was put 
into place in mid-1998.
 
• The optical disks could be searched easily using the Tumbleweed 
program.
	
✓	UBS backed up its e-mails at three time intervals. The protocols were as 
follows:
 
• E-mails were backed up daily, at the end of each day. Daily backup 
tapes were kept for 20 working days.
 
• E-mails were backed up weekly, on Friday nights. Weekly tapes 
were retained for one year.

32
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
 
• E-mails were backed up monthly, on the last business day of the 
month. Monthly tapes were retained for three years.
 
• At the end of the tapes’ retention schedule, they were recycled or 
reused.
	
	Because of the timing of the backups, some e-mails were never backed 
up. For example, if a user both received and deleted an e-mail on the 
same day, it wouldn’t reside on any backup tape.
	
✓	The Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Rule 17a-4 requires 
every broker and dealer to
	
	“. . . preserve for a period of not less than 3 years, the first two years in 
an accessible place . . . [o]riginals of all communications received and 
copies of all communications sent by such member, broker or dealer 
(including inter-office memoranda and communications) relating to his 
business as such.”
UBS claimed that some of the ESI requested by Laura was inaccessible, in 
part because of cost. Restoring those e-mails would cost approximately 
$175,000, excluding the cost of attorney time. Each backup tape would take 
an estimated five days to restore. Because each tape represents a snapshot 
of the hard drive of one server in a given month, each server/month had to 
be restored separately on a hard drive. Then, using the Double Mail program, 
an individual’s e-mail file could be extracted and exported to a Microsoft 
Outlook data file. After all those preparations to access the e-mail files, they 
could then be opened in Outlook and searched.
In deciding the issue of accessibility in response to UBS, Judge Scheindlin 
set precedent. She looked at the type of media on which the ESI is stored 
and the cost to produce it. Production costs depend on the accessibility of 
the ESI, which in turn depends on the media on which it is stored. The court 
identified five sources, or categories, of data used by most companies and 
listed them in order of decreasing accessibility. Notice the similarities and 
differences between these legal definitions of data sources and the technical 
definitions of stored data:
	
✓	Active, online data: The active stage is when the ESI is being created, 
received, or processed; or when it must be quickly and frequently 
accessed. Online storage involves magnetic disks, such as hard drives, 
which provide access within milliseconds.
	
✓	Near-line data: This category involves automated or robotic storage 
systems. Access speeds range from a few milliseconds up to two 
minutes. The storage media, such as optical disks, are removable.

33
 Chapter 2: Taking a Close Look at Electronically Stored Information (ESI)
	
✓	Offline storage and archives: This category is either magnetic tape or 
optical disks and is referred to as JBOD, which is short for just a bunch 
of disks. It differs from the preceding two categories in that the storage 
media are labeled, organized in shelves or racks, and accessed manually. 
Offline storage is meant for disaster recovery or for archiving records 
that will probably never be accessed. In either case, the media won’t 
be searchable. If disaster recovery is needed, the entire tape or disk is 
loaded.
	
✓	Backup tapes, commonly using data compression: Backup tapes are 
sequential access media. Like ESI stored for disaster recovery, the data 
is not organized for retrieving individual files. Retrieval typically requires 
restoring contents of the entire tape. Adding to the challenge and cost 
is the need to reverse any compression that was used to fit more bytes 
of data on the disks. The discovery of ESI from disaster recovery backup 
tapes and other sources that are not reasonably accessible requires proof 
that their relevance outweighs their retrieval and processing costs. In 
addition, the court may consider the extent to which their retrieval dis­
rupts business and information management activities.
	
✓	Erased, fragmented, or corrupted data:
 
• Files that are erased are not necessarily gone unless they’ve been 
overwritten by a new file.
 
•	A fragmented file is one whose contents were cut up and stored in 
separate (noncontiguous) areas.
 
• Corrupted files are files that have been damaged by computer 
viruses, or a hardware or software malfunction. Documents some­
times become corrupted by viruses or as they’re e-mailed from one 
type of e-mail system to another. Only after significant processing 
can these files be accessed, if they can be accessed at all.
Accessible versus inaccessible in federal cases
In the determination of whether ESI is acces­
sible for e-discovery, Judge Scheindlin stated:
“Of these, the first three categories are typi­
cally identified as accessible, and the latter 
two as inaccessible. The difference between 
the two classes is easy to appreciate. 
Information deemed ‘accessible’ is stored in 
a readily usable format. Although the time it 
takes to actually access the data ranges from 
milliseconds to days, the data does not need 
to be restored or otherwise manipulated to 
be usable. ‘Inaccessible’ data, on the other 
hand, is not readily usable. Backup tapes must 
be restored using a process similar to that 
previously described, fragmented data must 
be de-fragmented, and erased data must be 
reconstructed, all before the data is usable. 
That makes such data inaccessible.”

34
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
	
Nothing in the rules — specifically, Rule 34(b) — prevents the court from 
ordering that paper is a “reasonably usable” form where the only other source 
for the information is not reasonably accessible.
Taking the two-tier test
The five types of data sources are further grouped into two tiers, which form 
the basis for two-tier discovery and what is called the two-tiered test. Two-
tier discovery is defined in Rule 26(b)(2), which you can read more about in 
Chapter 4. The two-tiered test is a distinction between ESI found on sources 
that are reasonably accessible and sources that are not reasonably acces­
sible because of undue burden or cost. The mapping of the five sources to 
the two tiers is as follows:
	
✓	First-tier: This tier consists of the first three types of data sources 
(active, near-line, and offline), which are defined as reasonably 
accessible sources.
	
✓	Second-tier: This tier consists of the latter two data sources (backup 
tapes and erased, fragmented, or corrupted data), which are defined as 
not reasonably accessible.
Federal courts have refused to find “good cause” to order discovery from 
inaccessible sources when potential benefits don’t outweigh the burdens 
and costs.
	
Although reasonably accessible sources are those available without undue 
burden or cost, what constitutes undue remains a judgment call.
The two-tiered approach is used by courts for two purposes:
	
✓	Determining the scope of appropriate e-discovery: That is, to identify 
what is discoverable.
 
• First-tier sources: Relevant, nonprivileged, reasonably accessible ESI 
is considered to be within the scope of discovery. This is, it’s dis­
coverable, and you must produce it. A court order isn’t needed.
 
• Second-tier sources: Even when the source of ESI isn’t reasonably 
accessible and is presumed to be outside the scope of discovery, 
you must still identify the ESI by category or type if it’s potentially 
responsive. Note that this puts you between a rock and a hard 
place: If the source is not reasonably accessible (because it’s on 
unlabeled or nonindexed backup media, for example), how can 
you determine whether the ESI is potentially responsive? Tricky, 
isn’t it? Although you need to identify only sources of ESI that are 

35
 Chapter 2: Taking a Close Look at Electronically Stored Information (ESI)
not reasonably accessible, it might end up being discoverable if 
the requesting party is determined to access it. The requesting 
party has the option of showing good cause, a reason that the ESI is 
essential to its case, which might persuade the court to order you 
to produce ESI from second-tier sources.
	
✓	Figuring out how to allocate (shift) the cost of producing ESI among 
the parties: Figuring out who should pay for production or how to allo­
cate costs to each party is no less of a mess than figuring out what’s dis­
coverable. The oversimplified approach is:
 
• First tier-sources: Producing party pays.
 
• Second-tier sources: Costs may be shared by both parties. This is 
referred to as cost shifting because some costs are shifted from the 
producing party (who typically pays) to the requesting party. If a 
court orders discovery of second-tier ESI, your lawyer can ask the 
other party to help pay to produce it.
You can read about cost-shifting rules and related case law in Chapter 4.
Nothing’s easy when it comes to e-discovery. An element of mystery always 
exists because of the judgment calls — literally, the decision calls of judges. 
Also, ESI doesn’t fit neatly into cost categories. For example, active data 
is the number-one source of discoverable ESI, but it can still be tough and 
expensive (or, in legal-speak, an undue burden) to produce for litigation. 
Consider the following situations that complicate accessibility:
	
✓	Bankruptcies: ESI doesn’t disappear just because a company files for 
bankruptcy. The duty to preserve ESI doesn’t disappear, either. In a 
2006 bankruptcy-related case, In re Quintus Corp., Avaya acquired all 
the assets of Quintus, which had gone bankrupt. Later, the trustee filed 
a lawsuit for breach of contract against Avaya. Among other things, 
the trustee requested ESI, but Avaya failed to produce it. During the 
trial, the trustee learned that the requested ESI had been destroyed. 
Unfortunately for Avaya, the court found in favor of Quintus and held 
that, “Avaya deliberately deleted the debtors’ electronic records in 
order to give itself more computer space . . . [F]urther, Avaya did not 
merely alter the evidence, it destroyed it. Thus, the court concluded 
that the most severe sanction of judgment against Avaya [for discovery 
abuse] was warranted.”
	
	ESI is essential in bankruptcy cases and proceedings. Financial records 
are subject to discovery so they can be analyzed to identify illegal 
transfers or insider transactions. E-mail and financial records support 
or refute an actual fraud allegation. As a result, the incentive to destroy 
incriminating ESI can be irresistible, but this incentive is countered by 
even more powerful disincentives, such as losing a case.

36
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
	
✓	Mergers or acquisitions: When companies merge with or acquire other 
companies, they often use different types of systems. Because of incom­
patibility, some electronic records are converted to the prevailing format, 
leaving certain areas of the old system extremely difficult to access.
	
✓	Proprietary systems: Many businesses have custom-built or customized 
data systems that were not designed with good search tools. When ESI is 
produced from these systems, it can’t be comprehended.
	
✓	Transaction databases: The contents of these databases are so volatile 
that they require a lot of manipulation to produce.
Preserving the Digital Landscape
Retrieving content from servers, archives, backup tapes, and other media is 
just the beginning. You then need to preserve it — in the event that you have 
to process it and produce it to the requesting party.
Between the processes of identifying ESI as discoverable and then producing 
it is the none-too-trivial process of preservation. Preservation requires that 
you maintain ESI in an unaltered state or its native form. This obligation to 
preserve is referred to as a litigation hold, which you find out more about in 
Part III. Preserving ESI creates lots of anxiety because you can’t easily control 
it. The following list describes some of the many factors affecting your ability 
to preserve ESI and enforce litigation holds:
	
✓	ESI can be destroyed by the normal or automated operations of a 
company’s computer systems.
e-discovery in California overturns 
Zubulake decision
In July 2009, California overturned the Zubulake 
decision. California’s new e-discovery law, 
known as the Civil Discovery Act, did away 
with the two tiers specified by Zubulake. The 
act makes discoverable any ESI that’s stored 
for disaster recovery. Any company conduct­
ing business in California, therefore, may be 
required to produce all relevant ESI regardless 
of whether it’s active, archive, backup, or disas­
ter recovery material.
The Civil Discovery Act requires that the ESI 
be produced as it’s kept in the usual course of 
business, or that it be organized and labeled to 
correspond with the categories in the request. 
However, the courts generally don’t impose 
sanctions on a party or its attorney for failing 
to provide ESI that has been lost, damaged, 
altered, or overwritten as the result of the 
routine, good faith operation of an information 
system.

37
 Chapter 2: Taking a Close Look at Electronically Stored Information (ESI)
	
✓	Stopping routine or automated computer operations might be impos­
sible without additional hardware or other equipment. ESI may need to 
be moved to a secure server or archive.
	
✓	Trying to preserve and secure ESI is a juggling act for IT staff whose day 
jobs don’t leave time for them to retool to become e-discovery collection 
superheroes.
	
✓	Trying to convince employees not to destroy or tamper with files, e-mail, 
and other information related is tough because of their inclination to do 
exactly the opposite or their mistakes when preserving it.
	
✓	Preserving and continuing to enforce litigation holds can last for years. 
All new ESI that meets the litigation hold criteria must be held on to, too.
Computer systems automatically perform numerous functions. They create, 
change, update, discard, or overwrite data as part of their routine operations, 
often without anyone’s direction or awareness. Computers further complicate 
preservation and production because ESI might be deleted but can continue 
to exist in ways that are difficult to locate, retrieve, or review. Or, it might 
become progressively less accessible over time. Although the rules don’t fully 
define your duty to preserve, it’s comforting that the rules recognize the prob­
lems you face. But if you don’t deliberately preserve ESI, expect no mercy. 
No matter how bad the e-evidence, it’s better to produce it and take your 
lumps than to destroy it. Why? Because the law has harsh penalties meant 
to deter the destruction of evidence. One of the harshest takes place when 
a judge gives an adverse jury instruction. Referring to the Zubulake case in 
which UBS deleted e-mails and said that several computer backup tapes were 
missing, Judge Scheindlin told jurors they could conclude that the data had 
been destroyed because it contained damaging information. That instruction 
played a big part in the $29 million judgment against UBS.
	
Cherry-picking through ESI to remove risky content is neither legal nor wise. 
When litigation triggers, it’s necessary to prove that the deletion of this con­
tent was consistent with a good faith retention policy that you’ve applied 
rigorously.
Facing Sticker Shock: What ESI Costs
The first FRCP is a reminder to be fast, fair, and frugal, according to New York 
Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV. He states the following:
“Cases differ in cost and complexity. You have to sit down and figure out 
things like how much money and resources should be spent for a case 
that has a maximum award of $250,000. Electronic discovery can easily 
cost millions of dollars if you don’t rein things in.”

38
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
Fortunately, judges take proportionality tests into consideration (see Chapter 4). 
That’s nice, but it’s sobering to look at costs that others have paid. The pro­
portionality principle might not be obvious when you look at these price tags:
	
✓	In 2002, in Murphy oil v. Fluor Daniel, Fluor Daniel spent $6.2 million to 
restore and print e-mail from 93 backup tapes.
	
✓	In 2002, in Rowe Entertainment v. William Morris Agency, the William 
Morris Agency spent $9.7 million to restore e-mail from 200 tapes, in 
addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars to retrieve and review 
250,000 e-mail messages.
	
✓	In Bank of America Corp. v. SR Int’l Bus. Ins. Co. (2006), the restoration 
and organization of offline e-mail data from 400 backup tapes was an 
estimated $1.4 million.
When litigation hold mistakes are made, you might be forced to resort to 
backup tapes to satisfy your discovery obligations. Of course, these are 
avoidable e-discovery costs. In addition to these costs, there’s the financial 
hit from the disruption caused when your company has to shut down its 
e-mail server or financial systems as part of a preservation order because 
you failed to properly enforce a litigation hold.
Electronic discovery is also costly in terms of legal review. Once the content 
is restored, a legal team reviews it for relevance to the case at an estimated 
cost of $1,800 to $2,500 per gigabyte (GB). If your company stores 25 tera­
bytes (25,000GB), a discovery review of 25 percent of the information can 
cost between $11 million and $16 million.
e-discovery thrives in tough times
Litigation is countercyclical: As the U.S. econ­
omy melts down, litigation ramps up. The 2008 
financial crisis (and the worst bear market since 
the 1930s) drove up the number of lawsuits. 
In 2008, investors filed 210 federal securities 
class-action lawsuits, up 19 percent from 176 
lawsuits in 2007, according to the Stanford Law 
School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse 
(http://securities.stanford.
edu). Altogether, plaintiffs claimed that they 
had been robbed of $856 billion, or 27 percent 
more than in 2007. These cases involve enor­
mous volumes of ESI from companies with 
offices that are spread worldwide.
In one case, after a large commodities and 
financial services firm was caught shifting hun­
dreds of millions in debt off its books (this type 
of “creative accounting” is illegal), the banks 
that had underwritten the company’s initial 
public stock offering were sued for securities 
fraud. The lawyers and the e-discovery vendor 
Fios, Inc., retained by the banks in this case, 
faced an e-discovery nightmare: The banks had 
more than 100 data custodians, widely scat­
tered ESI stored on many types of media, and 
a large team of reviewers working at different 
locations across the USA. More than 70 unique 
ESI productions were made.

39
 Chapter 2: Taking a Close Look at Electronically Stored Information (ESI)
In some cases, you can’t locate all ESI within the allotted time. Or, you might 
not be able to place holds on all potentially responsive ESI. Some of it will be 
deleted during the lawsuit. Not being able to rope in ESI correctly can lead to 
stinging sanctions.
Estimating hard and hidden costs
Everyone wants to reduce the costs of e-discovery, and one way to do that 
is to take control of ESI. The $6 million question, which in this context is not 
simply a familiar expression, is how?
First, you need to break down the costs. The two cost buckets are
	
✓	Hard costs: Hard costs are those expenses that you pay by writing a 
check. In accounting terms, these are direct costs. Examples are mostly 
external expenses, such as legal services, third-party e-discovery fees, 
additional servers for preserving the ESI, and so on. Basically, hard 
costs are incurred when someone is sending you a bill or invoice to pay. 
Hard costs can break down further to correspond to the steps in the 
e-discovery process.
	
✓	Hidden costs: Hidden costs are the costs incorrectly allocated to 
other budget lines. Hidden costs are also referred to as soft or 
indirect costs and tend to be internal. Employees’ time spent on 
e-discovery instead of their regular job duties is a prime example. 
Business disruption and commotion are also in the hidden cost 
bucket.
Next, you evaluate which activities provide the best leverage on those costs. 
Considerations are
	
✓	Direct hard dollar costs are easiest to control in the short term. It helps 
that they’re easier to calculate courtesy of the monthly invoice. Of the 
e-discovery stages, processing and review costs tend to consume the 
biggest chunk of cash. The cost per labor hour is highest for those activ­
ities because they’re done by lawyers or paralegals.
	
✓	The soft costs of collecting and producing ESI, if done internally, tend to 
pale in comparison to review costs.
	
✓	The potentially biggest cost driver comes from the courts. You can get 
hit with a sanction or an unfavorable decision for not playing fair.
You get the smallest bang for your buck in the short term by cutting the 
costs of identification, preservation, and collection Your big payoff comes 
from working with your e-discovery team — lawyers and IT people alike — in 
order to focus on cutting costs of ESI processing and review.

40
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
One example of the tremendous cost of keeping everything comes from a 
large chemical company’s internal study. To persuade business leaders of the 
need for effective document retention and disposal policies, the company’s 
legal department conducted an internal cost assessment of a three-year 
litigation project. Two of its findings were
	
✓	Of the 75 million pages of text they reviewed during the 3-year period, 
more than 50 percent of the documents were out of date and should 
have been deleted.
	
✓	The cost of reviewing out-of-date documents amounted to $12 million.
Looking at the costs of being 
surprised by a request
If you wait until litigation is approaching to figure out what ESI you have, you’ve 
waited until it’s too late to do anything to control costs. Imagine waiting for a 
fire to install a sprinkler system. There’s no upper bound on costs in that 
scenario.
When e-discovery requests are made, the meter is ticking. Trying to do just 
a preliminary estimate of what’s discoverable or responsive and what’s not, 
and mapping where that ESI resides can easily take several weeks. You read 
about data maps in Chapter 6. When you’re packing mega-repositories hold­
ing ESI that have to be indexed before the meet-and-confer conference, and 
there’s no plan to jump into action, you’re wide open to sanctions from the 
court and power plays by your opposing party.
Five ways to cut costs are
	
✓	Cut down how much content you keep. You can minimize the costs of 
archiving, preserving, restoring, and reviewing ESI, and the risk of sanc­
tions for being out of compliance. Of course, you must take into consid­
eration operational, legal, and regulatory requirements.
	
✓	Organize ESI for litigation purposes. Historically, ESI was organized for 
disaster recovery, which requires a full restore of the data and doesn’t 
require finding and retrieving a few files or e-mails. But when ESI is orga­
nized and stored on tape for disaster recovery purposes, it’s less acces­
sible for precise search-and-rescue litigation missions. ESI now needs to 
be organized, indexed, and stored on media that facilitates responding 
to litigation.

41
 Chapter 2: Taking a Close Look at Electronically Stored Information (ESI)
	
✓	Send a message from top management. The rules and courts hold the 
company and its senior managers responsible for litigation-readiness 
policies and procedures. In turn, senior managers need to send a clear 
message to all data custodians and employees that such policies and 
procedures are important and must be followed. The ability to respond 
to e-discovery requests is highly dependent on data custodians and 
employees preserving what’s needed and disposing of what isn’t. 
Providing mandatory training sessions, e-mailing reminders of ESI reten­
tion policies, and imposing penalties for noncompliance help reinforce 
the message. This method is based on the “what’s important gets done” 
principle.
	
✓	Build a team of e-discovery experts. This team should include legal, IT, 
and human resources representatives and senior managers. As in a fire 
department, when an emergency occurs, trained experts immediately 
respond. They manage the situation by containing the blaze and minimiz­
ing damage. Managing e-discovery also requires people who have special­
ized skills and know how to respond to demanding activities. Because of 
tight deadlines and sanctions for missing them, you need a team that’s 
ready to respond intelligently. At the extreme, if your company cannot 
prepare for the meet-and-confer conference or is unable to respond to 
e-discovery requests, you’ve lost.
	
✓	Invest in outside help from e-discovery service providers. For most 
companies, getting litigation-ready or responding to an e-discovery 
request requires help from one or more e-discovery service providers. 
Categories of services include
  
• Design and offering of training programs
 
• Data gathering and media restoration
 
• Computer forensics
 
• ESI hosting, processing, review, and production
	
	These upfront investments in time, effort, and money, such as the ones 
you made in reading this book, can pay off in a single case — smart 
choice.
The courts are saying that there’s no plea to ignorance that will not waste 
money.

ery few cases are settled before discovery (before trial most likely, but 
not before discovery). They’re settled as a result of discovery after both 
sides learn the strengths and weaknesses of the other’s case. Decisions about 
whether to settle, or the terms of settlement, might begin to become clear 
only during e-discovery. That’s the importance of e-discovery and the value 
of doing the groundwork before facing litigation or a subpoena. Rush-job 
reactions rarely end well because they can’t withstand judicial scrutiny and 
are very expensive because they usually entail paying “rush” fees to vendors 
and over-time to employees. 
You want to be able to respond quickly and intelligently when you learn that 
you’re about to be a defendant or a non-party to litigation. A non-party, also 
called a third party, is neither a defendant nor plaintiff, but a company that 
gets swept into the case because it possesses relevant ESI. It’s easy to forget 
that e-discovery isn’t just about producing ESI to the other side. Electronic 
discovery is also about finding e-mail and documents that prove your inno­
cence to shelter you from false claims and companies taking a crack spin at 
the litigation wheel of fortune.
In this chapter, we discuss best practices in preparation for e-discovery, or 
prelitigation best practices, to help get your company into a rock-solid posi­
tion while keeping cost and risk under control. Getting prepared before 
litigation is looming gives you a tactical advantage, which just might be the 
decisive one. You’re better positioned to negotiate with opponents and to 
justify the reasonableness of your actions to the court. Courts don’t demand 
perfection, but they expect good faith efforts from you.

Setting Up a Reasonable 
Defensive Strategy
American film director and actor Woody Allen casually observed that in life 
“80 percent of success is just showing up.” A lot of litigation success, like life, 
is showing up at the meet-and-confer conference prepared for e-discovery. 
The timeline in Figure 3-1 shows that your prelitigation strategy begins when 
you can reasonably anticipate litigation. By applying a defensive prelitigation 
strategy that’s monitored actively, you’re ready to respond. Risk and cost are 
directly related to quickly identifying, monitoring, and managing ESI when 
litigation holds are needed. You can read how litigation holds need to throw 
a straightjacket around routine data operations to preserve relevant ESI in 
the section “Braking for Legal Holds” in this chapter. In contrast, if you can’t 
defend your strategy (perhaps because you don’t have one), you should be 
very worried (perhaps even alarmed).
An overview of prelitigation readiness best practices is not complete unless 
we also point out the worst practices that can bulldoze your credibility or 
case. Claiming ignorance about the whereabouts of missing documents, 
even if it’s true, or taking a passive or lackadaisical (in legalese, “purpose­
ful sluggishness” or “willful blindness”) approach to ESI archiving are worst 
practices. Any defense that sounds like an excuse coming from Beavis and 
Butthead is damaging.

 Chapter 3: Building e-Discovery Best Practices into Your Company
	
In e-discovery disputes, the outcome comes down to what a judge or 
magistrate finds is reasonable under the circumstances of each case. The 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) provide only a blueprint to follow for 
e-discovery, but there are still best practices for prelitigation regardless of 
the court you’re in.
Heeding judicial advice
An obvious prelitigation best practice is to follow the advice of judges. 
Judges have the power, courtesy of Rule 37(f), to impose sanctions if you fail 
to obey an order to provide or permit discovery. This to-the-point wording 
recognizes a binary situation: Either you obey or you do not obey. As Yoda 
had warned Luke Skywalker, “there is no try.” Sanctions for not obeying 
range from monetary fines to adverse inference instructions, which entails 
telling the jury they can assume you’ve something to hide. The judge could 
even dismiss your case. 
You can improve your strategy by learning from others’ experiences. Judges 
have set precedents that deal with prelitigation readiness. The following lists 
the lessons learned and the cases they are cited in:
	
✓	Take affirmative steps to preserve ESI: In Zubulake v. UBS Warburg 
(2004), Judge Shira A. Scheindlin held that it’s no longer sufficient 
merely to issue a passive litigation hold throughout your company. 
A litigation hold, or legal hold, is an order to stop destruction and pre­
serve all records, regardless of form, related to a legal action. In other 
words, you must take affirmative steps to hold onto e-evidence. 
	
✓	IT must be informed of their duties: In Kevin Keithley v. The Home Store.
com (2008), Magistrate Judge Elizabeth D. Laporte ruled that the defen­
dant could not claim its IT personnel were ignorant of the importance 
of preserving ESI. For being reckless by not taking affirmative steps to 
safeguard data, defendants paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for 
plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and were hit with an adverse jury instruction.
	
✓	Lawyers must supervise the process: In United States v. Philip Morris 
USA Inc. (2004), Judge Gladys Kessler held that corporate (in-house) law­
yers must “forcefully intervene” to ensure that e-evidence is preserved. 
The rules require, and case law enforces, that in-house lawyers learn 
enough to actively manage and participate in proper preservation, col­
lection, review, and production of ESI and not pass off that responsibil­
ity to the IT department. It’s their responsibility to put litigation hold 
instructions in writing, distribute them widely, follow up frequently, and 
confirm that they’ve been followed religiously.

46
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
	
✓	Consider electronic evidence and its authenticity from the outset: In 
Lorraine v. Markel Am. Ins. Co. (2007), Magistrate Judge Paul W. Grimm 
makes it clear that you need to think about ESI evidentiary issues much 
earlier than with hardcopy evidentiary materials. ESI becomes inac­
cessible and may be deleted a lot faster than hard copies. You need 
to consider how potential e-evidence is handled by records retention 
programs, and be able to promptly suspend automated processes that 
could alter or overwrite relevant ESI. You also need to be prepared to 
deal with ESI authentication challenges. Authentication requires that 
you keep metadata intact and may require that e-mail or documents be 
examined by a computer forensic expert, as you find out in Chapter 13. 
A judge may rule that your e-mail or other documents are inadmissible 
evidence if there’s doubt about their authenticity.
	
✓	Your legal counsel is responsible for the litigation hold, but your 
company is in the line of fire too: In Arteria Property Pty Ltd. v. Universal 
Funding V.T.O., Inc. (2008), Judge Ronald J. Hedges sanctioned the defen­
dant for failing to preserve the content on its Web site even though a 
third-party Web designer (intermediary) managed it. Hedges stated the 
following:
	
	“This Court sees no reason to treat Web sites differently than other 
electronic files. . . . Despite the inevitable presence of an intermediary 
when posting content on the Web, the Court finds that Defendants still 
had the ultimate authority, and thus control, to add, delete, or modify 
the Web site’s content.”
To keep current with prelitigation best practices, see Chapter 19. For an in-
depth review of seminal cases, see Chapter 20. 
Keeping ESI intact and in-reach
Another obvious but often overlooked best practice is keeping ESI that needs 
to be kept. You may hear this referred to as archiving or preserving, or as a 
litigation hold, although the meanings of these terms differ depending on the 
context or timeline. Here’s how you might distinguish these concepts:
	
✓	Archiving is the retention of ESI in an organized way and with an 
index. Archiving is done with a specialized archiving system that 
enables you to centrally manage the archive. The index makes the con­
tent searchable. The index is comparable to an index in a book that you 
use to find a word in the book. 
	
	Archives differ from backup copies in that backups can be unsearchable 
data dumps. Archiving begins when ESI must be retained for business, 
compliance, regulatory, or audit purposes. During this stage, companies 
operate their businesses normally, continually producing ESI and using 
it to do business.

47
 Chapter 3: Building e-Discovery Best Practices into Your Company
	
✓	Preserving is archiving with intent. The term preservation implies 
something mandatory, or a greater sense of urgency, because of the 
matter at hand. There’s a duty to preserve ESI according to business, 
regulatory, and litigation requirements, but no duty to archive. 
	
	Depending on the case and ESI, preservation (like authentication) may 
also require the forensic imaging of a hard drive, which you can read 
about in Chapter 13.
	
✓	A litigation hold is both a red alert and a lockdown. A litigation hold is 
written notice from in-house counsel and management to data custodi­
ans, IT staff, and those who are likely to have relevant ESI. 
	
	It’s also a lockdown on data repositories to protect them from being 
altered, deleted, or lost either accidentally or deliberately. For example, 
files can be locked down by changing the file’s permission from unre­
stricted (allowing full access and edit permission) to restricted (provid­
ing permission to read, but not to edit). 
Even if you’re not a party to litigation, your ESI 
may become subject to e-discovery. A court 
can order you to produce relevant ESI even if 
you’re a non-party. Consider the experience of 
the audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). 
PwC was a non-party in an e-discovery dis­
pute, United States ex rel. Parikh v. Premera 
Blue Cross (2007). Defendant Premera Blue 
Cross had hired PwC to audit the Medicare pay­
ments it had received. In November 2006, PwC 
received a subpoena ordering it to produce all 
its e-mails with Premera. PwC produced only 
some of the requested e-mails arguing that the 
cost of retrieving the archived e-mails was too 
burdensome. Note that PwC objected on the 
grounds that the retrieval was too expensive, 
but didn’t identify the standard it used to cal­
culate the expense. The court, in its response 
to PwC’s objection, focused on the production 
costs and not the retrieval costs. The court’s 
response was, in part, as follows:
“We understand that PwC has and will produce 
e-mails that are not archived and are otherwise 
available and we infer that the cost of retriev­
ing archived e-mails would be considerable. 
Nevertheless, if PwC . . . ‘is preparing to pro­
duce some … e-mails,’ the implication is that it 
has retrieved all e-mails. Taking PwC at its word 
then, the cost of retrieval has already been 
assumed and the argument is over the cost of 
production. In this Court’s opinion, the cost of 
production is minimal.”
PwC was ordered to produce the disputed 6,500 
e-mails and bill to Plaintiff’s counsel for the rea­
sonable cost of production.
Being a non-party puts you under the rules

Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
Braking for Litigation Holds
Courts have uniformly held that the FRCP and case law impose on you and 
your attorneys a joint obligation to preserve all ESI and other evidence that’s 
relevant to issues in the lawsuit, or that could lead to the discovery of rel­
evant evidence. There’s no escaping this duty. Compliance with the litigation 
hold process in a timely manner is critical. Not doing so can result in painful 
court-ordered monetary sanctions; adverse inference jury instructions; or, 
worst case, a default judgment against your company.
The first part of your strategy should be to put a litigation hold on anything 
that might be subject to discovery. Litigation holds don’t take care of them­
selves. For a genuine litigation hold, you have to actively implement steps 
that you can trust will slam on the brakes on inappropriate ESI disposal 
immediately. Direct all questions and concerns to your in-house lawyers to 
whom you report. You may be responsible to implementing the hold, but 
legal counsel must review your company’s litigation hold process and 
procedures, ensuring that they’re defendable to the court. 
	
Assign the management of litigation holds only to those people who you can 
trust to perform that duty. Relying on custodians (employees) to preserve ESI 
is not sufficient evidence of a good faith litigation hold effort.
Insuring a stronghold
Here are steps that you together with legal counsel can take when a litigation 
hold starts:
	
1.	Identify what ESI needs to be preserved, where it is, and who has a 
copy of it.
	
	 Before a litigation hold notice is even drafted, you and your attorney 
must work together to determine what documents are relevant based on 
what dates and time periods are relevant to the elements of the case, the 
location of every device storing it, and the data custodians who control 
those documents. 
	
2.	Designate someone to be in charge of the litigation hold. 
	
	 You need someone who has the authority, time, and expertise to 
manage the hold process on a daily basis until that duty is released. 
Appoint someone with technical skills because holds disrupt comput­
ing operations. This is also the go-to person for technical questions and 
problems from data custodians, end users, and even legal counsel.
	
	 The litigation hold can span several years so appointing a successor can 
help with the continuity. 

49
 Chapter 3: Building e-Discovery Best Practices into Your Company
	
	 This role may expand to that of designated corporate witness, also 
referred to the 30(b)(6) witness, who testifies in a deposition (testimony 
under oath outside of court). Chapter 7 goes into more detail about how 
to pick an ideal 30(b)(6) witness. 
	
3.	Notify everyone potentially involved in the litigation hold.
	
	 You need to tell data custodians, IT staff, and those within the scope of 
the hold the specific actions they need to take and the actions they must 
not take. Like all policies that you might have to defend later, the lan­
guage and directions need to be clear and doable. 
	
	 Finding out about a litigation hold is like spotting a radar detector while 
you’re driving on a highway. If you’re speeding, you automatically hit 
the brakes. And if you’re not speeding, you still automatically hit the 
brakes. That is, your reaction may be exactly the same (pent-up guilt, 
maybe). If you learned that your e-mails might be exhibit A in a lawsuit, 
would you be tempted to delete them, litigation hold or not? If yes, you 
realize that you need to prevent others from doing the same thing.
	
4.	Actively verify compliance and document your efforts.
	
	 Compliance with the litigation hold policy has to be monitored so 
people know that the policy isn’t just for show. You’ll need to provide 
evidence that the policy was proactively monitored, so document your 
efforts and any remediation you made to bring the hold up to standards. 
	
	 Keeping a complete record in order to assure, and if necessary to prove, 
reasonable efforts to meet the duty to preserve is worth the tedious 
effort. Litigation hold notices are useless unless they’re enforced and it’s 
verified that you’re in compliance. Your company and your attorneys 
are jointly responsible.
	
5.	Release the hold.
	
	 When the coast is clear, release the hold and thank people for their 
cooperation. Being nice now might help you during the next litigation 
hold.
Getting others to buy-in
Not everyone will take you or the litigation hold seriously. Here are some tips 
for getting others to follow through on the hold:
	
✓	Communicate directly with all key producers, users, and owners of 
potentially relevant ESI to learn or confirm what they possess. You 
want to directly contact these people in order to minimize the chance of 
ESI that you didn’t know existed materials later. 
	
✓	Explain to employees their role and responsibilities throughout the 
litigation hold and the reason for the extra work or disruption. To 
motivate, be clear that their compliance will be monitored. 

50
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
	
✓	Monitor and follow-up with key personnel to verify their compliance 
with litigation holds. You can safely assume that people will ignore your 
written notices about litigation holds unless they know that their com­
pliance is being monitored.
	
✓	Inform managers and IT staff to keep all ESI from accounts of depart­
ing employees until they’re told that the hold is over. Develop proce­
dures for preserving ESI when custodians leave the company and their 
duties are reassigned, especially in prospective litigation holds.
	
✓	Notify IT staff to suspend the routine wiping of hard drives, which 
may be done when computers are reassigned, or servers. In Padgett 
v. City of Monte Sereno (2007), the defendant was sanctioned when an 
employee, who had no knowledge of pending litigation, reformatted a 
co-worker’s hard drive that stored relevant ESI. The court held that the 
defendant failed to take adequate precautions to preserve the co-worker’s 
computer equipment.
	
✓	Examine litigation hold procedures on a regular basis to verify that 
they continue to function as needed. Again, being as proactive as pos­
sible always looks good with the court.
	
✓	Keep information secure. Protect ESI from cyber-nastiness while it’s in 
hold with intrusion detection systems, anti-malware and spyware soft­
ware, and firewalls.
	
✓	Act in good faith (always a best practice) and document that you did 
so. You’ll want to back up your actions just in case you have to justify 
them in court.
	
Claiming ignorance about missing documents, even if it’s true, and being pas­
sive about protecting ESI are not acceptable defenses. 
Check out Chapter 7 to find out how to design, implement, and preserve a 
litigation hold.
Holding on tight to your ESI
Billions of e-mails, documents, and spreadsheets are created by compa­
nies every day — and a huge number are destroyed each day in the normal 
course of business. Users make their own deletion decisions and companies 
have automated e-mail deletion software and their own document retention 
and destruction policies. Doing a litigation hold in under these chaotic con­
ditions is not going to be easy. No matter how difficult, you cannot transfer 
litigation hold obligations to employees.
Phillip M. Adams and Associates v. Dell, Fujitsu, Sony, ASUS Computer 
International, et al (2009) illustrates this point. The case involved several 
major computer manufacturers charged with illegally using Dr. Phillip 
Adams’s patented software. The court singled out ASUS, one of the 

51
 Chapter 3: Building e-Discovery Best Practices into Your Company
defendants, because of its response to the e-discovery request. ASUS pro­
duced very few documents, and claimed that it had not destroyed any rel­
evant documents. Because of their suspiciously poor response, the plaintiff 
asked the court for sanctions alleging that ASUS had deliberately destroyed 
e-mail evidence. Deliberate destruction of evidence is called spoliation. 
To defend against spoliation charges, ASUS explained that
	
✓	Employees were responsible for preserving e-mails by downloading 
them to their individual computers because its e-mail servers were inca­
pable of archiving. 
	
✓	Employees themselves decided which e-mails to preserve. 
	
✓	Employees’ computers were routinely replaced, and individual employ­
ees were responsible for determining which information should be 
transferred to a new computer. Information the individual employee did 
not save was erased. 
The Court rejected ASUS’s argument that it had made employees responsible 
for managing and retaining e-mail. The court found that ASUS violated its 
duty to preserve the information and that the loss of ESI wasn’t due to the 
“routine, good faith operation of electronic information systems.” The court’s 
response included the following explanation:
“An organization should have reasonable policies and procedures for 
managing its information and records. . . . The absence of a coherent doc­
ument retention policy is a pertinent factor to consider when evaluating 
sanctions. . . . It is clear that ASUS’ lack of a retention policy and irrespon­
sible data retention practices are responsible for the loss of significant 
data.”
This case illustrates why e-mail retention policies and procedures, as well 
as archiving technology, are invaluable best practices. Having electronic 
records management (ERM) programs that include ESI retention policies are 
key to a spoliation defense. (We discuss setting up an ERM in Chapter 14.) 
Conversely, relying on your employees’ judgment for managing and retaining 
e-mail or other documents is a worst practice. 
Putting Best Practices into Place
Stored ESI spans everything from network drives and computer hard drives 
to iPods and cellphones. But that’s not all. Potential ESI exists on social net­
works, social media sites, and collaboration platforms. (Social networks and 
media are collectively known as Web 2.0, which is pronounced Web-2-O, like 
H-2-O.) This section explains these three potential sources for ESI and also 
their discoverability.

52
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
Common characteristics of Web 2.0 are that the content is user-generated, 
edited, and deleted; and the content changes constantly. Users may mistak­
enly believe that what they do or say is private, short-lived, or really deleted. 
User activity on social networking sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and 
MySpace is serious concern for companies because it’s discoverable and may 
fall within a litigation hold. Content from Web 2.0 may be discoverable for 
several reasons:
	
✓	Much of the content gets archived for indefinite lengths of time.
	
✓	Employees may be using various forms within the scope of their jobs.
	
✓	Posts and files relevant to litigation may reside only in the Web 2.0 space. 
	
✓	Web 2.0 storage solutions, like landfills, are growing rapidly and are 
bound to catch the attention of litigants. There was a time when e-mail 
and text messages weren’t central to e-discovery. 
	
Best practices for social media, at this point, are to treat Web 2.0 content as 
much like other ESI as possible. Recognize that trying to get a handle on Web 
2.0 is like herding cats. For prelitigation purposes, the main preparations to 
undertake are
	
✓	Create an inventory log. Note which media and networks are being 
used by your company, divisions, departments, other units, and employ­
ees. Log names, types, dates, and reasons for use.
	
✓	Document where the info goes. Find out who stores the content, what 
their data destruction policies are, and how to obtain authenticated 
copies of the content.
In Biegel v. Norberg (filed February 2008 in the Superior Court, County of San 
Francisco), a chiropractor sued a former patient for defamation and inva­
sion of privacy based on the patient’s critical postings on Yelp. Norberg, 
the former patient and defendant, tried to spin his defense into a freedom of 
speech cause. Visit Citizen Media Law at www.citimedialaw.org for cases 
on defamation, copyright infringement, and free speech on Web 2.0 media.
Social networks
Social networks are Web-based services that allow individuals or companies 
to build a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system. Time spent 
on social networks surpassed that for e-mail for the first time in February 
2009. Social networking technologies include
	
✓	Blogs: A blog is a Web site that’s used for self-publishing. The term blog 
is short for Web log.
	
✓	Podcasts: Audio or video content that is downloaded for viewing or lis­
tening offline. Any device that can play MP3 audio files can be used to 
play podcasts.

53
 Chapter 3: Building e-Discovery Best Practices into Your Company
	
✓	RSS: RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. RSS feeds send updated 
information automatically to a digital device. Users control which RSS 
gets fed to their devices. 
	
✓	Wikis: A wiki is a Web site used as a collaboration tool. Pages can be 
changed and published immediately using only a Web browser. Pages 
are automatically created and linked to each other. A successful global 
wiki is Wikipedia, which can be found at www.wikipedia.com.
Social media sites and platforms
Social media refers to the content created and published on a social Web site 
by anyone who wants to. Social media is made up of personal and commer­
cial conversations and connections enabled across channels of mass impact 
and scale. Social media are more easily discoverable than just about any 
other form of user-generated content for as long as it remains online. Most 
content is archived and retained. Social media service providers retain con­
tent regardless of users’ expectations of privacy. For example, the full text of 
a string of personal e-mail messages sent between two Facebook members 
can be subject to discovery or subpoena years later. Of course, there are 
more than a few elected officials who have found their personal messages the 
news feature on Fox or CNN.
A few of the many very popular social media sites are
	
✓	YouTube (http://youtube.com): A video sharing Web site where 
users can create, upload, view, and share video clips. 
	
✓	Facebook (http://facebook.com): A site that started out as a service 
for university students but which has evolved to the point where one-
third of its global audience is aged 35 to 49 years, and one-quarter is 
over 50 years old.
	
✓	MySpace (http://myspace.com): MySpace is one of the world’s larg­
est social networks. 
	
✓	LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com): A service for building a network of 
professional contacts. 
	
✓	Yelp (www.yelp.com): Members can post local reviews for the purpose 
of creating a local online community. 
	
✓	Twitter (http://twitter.com): A microblogging platform for sending 
and receiving short text messages called tweets.
Increasingly, companies are using enterprise social media platforms such as 
Jive or SocialText that enable internal blogs and wikis. If your company uses 
social media networks or platforms, you must take steps during a litigation 
hold to ensure that the data can be preserved, retrieved, and produced if 
requested. For example, if your company uses Twitter to reach its customers, 
you need to be prepared to preserve and produce those postings if relevant 

54
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
to a litigation. Even though this data is not in the custody or control of your 
company, it does not excuse the duty to be able to preserve and collect it.
Collaboration platforms
Collaboration platforms are Web-based technologies used primarily for 
accessing, viewing, and sharing documents. With these platforms, you’re 
dealing with the Web instead of the hard drive for file storage. The two most 
widely used Web-based collaboration tools are
	
✓	Google Docs: A free Web-based application offered by Google used to 
work together on word processed documents, spreadsheets, and pre­
sentations. With Google Docs, you can easily and collaboratively create, 
edit, and upload Microsoft Word documents or Excel spreadsheets. 
	
✓	Microsoft Office Live Workspace: A Web-accessible technology that 
allows Microsoft Office users to collaborate easily on documents.
With either Google Docs or Office Live, specific documents or entire work­
spaces can be shared with other people of your choosing. 
Forming Response Teams
Electronic discovery is not just for IT or legal experts. Consider what 
e-discovery touches:
	
✓	Electronic records management
	
✓	Risk management
	
✓	Litigation holds
	
✓	ESI storage, disruption of computing operations, disaster recovery
	
✓	Data preservation, authentication, and recovery of deleted or corrupted 
data
	
✓	Human relations, if employee misconduct is involved
	
✓	Accounting, if fraud is involved
	
✓	Public relations or damage control
As with any incident response situation, you want to assemble an e-discovery 
response team to help take care of your ESI preservation duties. The 
e-discovery response team should be composed of senior management (the 
data owners), corporate (in-house) counsel, IT staff, outside counsel, human 
relations managers, accounting managers, and possibly an e-discovery ser­
vice provider or vendor. Electronic discovery vendors are invaluable (mean­
ing that they’re worth the expense) if you have no experience or expertise. 

55
 Chapter 3: Building e-Discovery Best Practices into Your Company
The chances are not in your favor that the team will work in harmony when 
in crisis. Someone with clout, patience, and a coaching personality is a good 
candidate for being in charge. If no such person exists, select someone who 
understands the e-discovery FRCP, which you can find out more about in 
Chapter 4. Electronic discovery is about the rules and case law, not about IT. 
IT and legal professionals sometimes differ on how to respond to e-discovery 
requests. Lawyers don’t understand the intricacies of ESI and storage devices. 
IT experts don’t understand rules of evidence or depositions. This leaves 
a knowledge gap among team members. Misunderstanding of specialized 
terminology coupled with bad group dynamics can neutralize even a 
brilliant legal strategy for winning a case.
Putting Project Management 
into Practice
Electronic discovery fits the definition of a project. A project is a collection of 
activities that need to be completed to achieve an outcome. Characteristics 
of a project that also are characteristics of prelitigation and e-discovery are
	
✓	Has an identifiable beginning, end, schedule, and approach, which is 
determined for the most part by the rules, court order, or other author­
ity outside of your control.
	
✓	Has milestones marking completion of a series of tasks, such as the 
review of a specific volume of ESI. 
	
✓	Has multiple activities that might occur sequentially or concurrently. If 
e-discovery activities are not done concurrently, you can expect to miss 
many milestones and scheduled deadlines.
	
✓	Uses resources (people, equipment, and money, for example) specifi­
cally allocated to the tasks that need to be completed. You are one of 
those resources. 
	
✓	Recognizes that your resources are also your constraints, due to limited 
resources or deadlines. If when laying out the project and doing the 
math on work-hours needed and availability of workers, you estimate a 
shortage, that’s the time to fix that deficiency. 
	
✓	Has end results with specific goals — typically time, cost, performance, 
or quality. Your e-discovery request pretty much clarifies the end 
results. 
	
✓	Involves a team of people, which is the e-discovery team.

56
Part I: Examining e-Discovery and ESI Essentials 
Two of the factors driving the management of the e-discovery project are
	
✓	What’s at stake with the case 
	
✓	How savvy the opponent is
Tackling the triple constraints
When you’re involved in prelitigation, you’re challenged to simultaneously 
manage what project managers call the triple constraint (see Figure 3-2): 
	
✓	Time or schedule, which includes many time-critical events such as the 
meet-and-confer session and scheduling conference
	
✓	Scope, which notoriously morphs as the project progresses 
	
✓	Budget or cost, which is rarely sufficient from the outset
	
Figure 3-2: 
The triple 
constraint 
of project 
manage-
ment.
	
The earlier you identify the constraints, the better your chances of intel­
ligently prioritizing and deciding on trade-offs. You may need to make trade-
offs to balance time, scope, and costs so as not to compromise quality of the 
work (see Figure 3-3). Production is useless if done on time, but privilege is 
produced.

 Chapter 3: Building e-Discovery Best Practices into Your Company
If you’re struggling with dealing with all three, check out Project Management 
For Dummies by Teresa Luckey and Joseph Phillips (Wiley). 
The successful project manager in e-discovery has to play many roles: part 
manager and technical expert, part litigator and paralegal, and part coach 
and problem fixer. Taking the time to define constraints and critical tasks 
early on reduces your stress level and panic.
Managing the critical path
Tasks must be completed in a specific order to get the job done. In e-discovery, 
you identify before your preserve and collect; and you preserve and collect 
before you process, review, and analyze until you’re able to produce the 
responsive ESI. Certain tasks make up what is called the critical path, which 
is an important principle of project management. Smartly, those tasks are 
called critical tasks. The critical path consists of activities or tasks that must 
start and finish on schedule or else the project completion will be delayed — 
unless action is taken to expedite one or more critical tasks There are many 
non-critical paths composed of tasks that may or may not be critical. The 
critical path may change throughout a project so you need to monitor and 
manage the critical and non-critical paths. 
The purpose of the critical path method (CPM) is to recognize which activi­
ties are on the critical path so that you know where to focus your efforts. You 
use critical tasks to identify or prioritize trade-offs. 
Maintaining Ethical Conduct 
and Credibility
Companies involved in e-discovery have duties, like the duty to preserve ESI 
relevant to the litigation, duties to meet deadlines, and many more that you 
read about throughout this book. Failure to maintain your ethical conduct 
and credibility creates risks of sanctions. In brief, taking those risks is not 
worthwhile. Failure to exercise prelitigation best practices, resulting in the 
destruction of e-evidence, is illegal. Chances of getting caught destroying 
e-evidence are increasing as judges and opponents become more aware of 
the technology side of e-discovery. 
The biggest risk with the severest sanctions is a charge of spoliation. 
Spoliation is the dreaded “you’re guilty of destroying evidence,” which is an 
obstruction of justice. 
You can read about spoliation and its consequences in Chapter 4.

Par t II
Guidelines for 
e-Discovery and 
Professional 
Competence

In this part . . .
T
his second part gives you an up-close look at the 
e-discovery amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure, the advisory guidelines that are taken seri­
ously by the bench, and the generally expected standards 
of legal competence and conduct. As a lawyer practicing 
in the e-discovery arena, an IT person drafted into an 
e-discovery team, or someone wanting to know what to 
look for in their legal counsel, you get valuable advice in 
Chapters 4 and 5.
In Chapter 4, you get better acquainted with e-discovery 
rules, the concepts of proportionality, and the importance 
of balancing the cost of a case with its importance. You’re 
introduced to the new Federal Rule of Evidence 502 and 
other evidence rules that apply to the admissibility of ESI. 
We discuss the industry-standard Electronic Discovery 
Reference Model (EDRM) and the guidelines of The 
Sedona Conference, a non-partisan think tank on law and 
policy. With this foundation, you’re better prepared to 
understand the process of preserving, collecting, process­
ing, reviewing, and producing ESI.
Also in Chapter 4, you read how the e-discovery rules 
introduce new obligations and expand lawyers’ role in 
handling cases involving ESI, both civil and criminal cases. 
Legal competence now includes technological compe­
tence. You see that lawyers are expressly advised to 
become familiar with their client’s computer technologies 
and ESI-management policies before the Rule 16 Pretrial 
Conference. 
Courts can be critical of lawyers who don’t acquire this 
familiarity, which we cover in Chapter 5. You find out why 
relying on the American Bar Association’s (ABA) Model 
Rules of Professional Conduct can be a career-saver, and 
the downside of straying from these rules. You recognize 
when calling upon the court for clarification or for com­
plex litigation is the wise thing to do.
“If you can’t explain what you’re doing in simple English, 
you’re probably doing something wrong.”

T
o win a legal action you must be able to prove your case. How you con­
vince the court that your side of the story is true is controlled by various 
federal rules of procedure and evidence, or state equivalents. ESI is the ideal 
witness because of its perfect memory and persuasiveness, but only if it’s 
considered relevant according to federal rules, state rules, or by some other 
authority. Both parties and non-parties to litigation need to understand and 
follow the rules. Imagine a hockey game played without rules. How would you 
know who wins or when the game is over if you don’t know how the game is 
played? That’s why there’s a rulebook. 
Fortunately, you have rulebooks to follow with e-discovery, too. In fed­
eral civil matters, e-discovery is controlled by the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure (FRCP). In criminal cases, e-discovery is controlled by the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCrimP). Throughout the process 
of e-discovery is the paramount concern of getting evidence you can use in 
court to prove your case. Rules of e-discovery are set forth in the Federal 
Rules of Evidence (FRE). In state court matters, e-discovery is covered by 
the equivalent rules of the state.
In this chapter, you find out about e-discovery and evidence rules applicable 
to ESI. You can be involved as a party or a third party who’s holding ESI that 
another party wants. The basic structure we present helps you understand 
the process of obtaining, protecting, and presenting ESI.

Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery and Professional Competence 
Knowing the Rules You Must Play By
The courts amended the FRCP (see Chapter 1) when they realized they were 
futilely trying to text message with rotary phones. The FRCP is now in the 
new millennium filled with iPhones and ESI.
If the FRCP is the global positioning system for e-discovery, then the road­
map was drawn in Zubulake v. UBS Warburg. There were five Zubulake opin­
ions oddly enough, called Zubulake I, II, III, IV, and V. Four of those were 
groundbreaking opinions in the area of ESI (see Chapter 2). Judge Scheindlin 
laid the foundation for much of the e-discovery rules now in effect. You see 
these cases come up throughout this book.
Although you have a lot of guidance and structure in civil matters, the same 
cannot be said of criminal law. As a result, courts have been applying the 
concepts of the civil rules to deal with e-discovery in criminal matters. Even 
in federal court, a special local rule may apply to e-discovery. Although the 
FRCP is the overriding rule, local courts may have slight modifications. Care 
must be taken to make sure that the local rule is followed.
	
You can’t assume that federal law will govern your case. State cases will be 
handled under state rules of e-discovery. Many states have adopted rules simi­
lar to the FRCP but not uniformly. When in doubt, ask your attorney.
Throughout the entire e-discovery process, you should consider how ESI 
could affect the outcome of your case. Just because you have it, doesn’t 
mean you can use it. You may be right, but can you prove it? What is admis­
sible in court is determined by the rules of evidence. In federal cases, that is 
the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE). Each state has its own rules of evidence. 
In most situations, they are similar to the federal rules but not exact. It is 
important that your attorney is familiar with the applicable evidentiary rules. 
The case can be won or lost here. Table 4-1 compares the applicable rules for 
various types of cases.

Deciphering the FRCP
The FRCP sets out a path to manage a lawsuit from the filing of a complaint to 
its conclusion. The filing of a complaint by a plaintiff commences a civil case. 
The party sued is the defendant. The failure to follow the FRCP properly can 
result in everything from sanctions to actually losing the case. Don’t rely on 
the forgiveness of a judge; strict adherence to the rules is always your best 
policy.
	
In Federal Court, all federal rules apply to a lawsuit. Thus, in any case, all the 
FRCP must be considered and reviewed.
FRCP 1
The first rule of the FRCP is often overlooked because of its simplicity. 
However, it sets forth a clear purpose for the rules: To secure the just, 
speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action. Remember this when 
establishing your plan of discovery and possible cost. You can reduce cost 
by applying best practices (Chapter 3), proper planning (Chapters 6 and 8), 
or possibly shifting some of the cost to your opponent (Chapter 12). 
FRCP 16
The courts manage e-discovery through Rule 16. The court’s scheduling 
order sets the time to complete discovery and may provide for the following:
	
✓	Limits on the extent of discovery.
	
✓	Provisions on disclosure or discovery of ESI.

64
Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery and Professional Competence 
	
✓	Any agreements of the parties asserting claims of privilege or protection 
after production, such as clawback or quick-peek agreements. (See a 
complete discussion in Chapter 10.)
	
✓	The dates of future conferences or the trial.
	
✓	Any other matter appropriate to the court to include.
	
Request an incorporation of agreements into the scheduling order. If your 
opponent fails to comply with the agreement, then they have violated a court 
order. See Chapter 9.
The scheduling and planning conference takes place after the court has 
received your meet-and-confer report (see the next section). This conference 
cannot be later than 120 days after the complaint was served (not filed) on 
the defendant. Hopefully, you and your opponent can reach agreements to 
reduce e-discovery cost.
The court may issue a preservation order under Rule 16(c) or a protective 
order:
	
✓	Preservation: A preservation order clearly defines what ESI you and 
your opponent need to preserve. Having specific directions of what to 
preserve is significant to avoid possible sanctions if you happen to lose 
discoverable ESI due to a lack of understanding of what you should have 
preserved. 
	
	A preservation order allows you to get your hands around the ESI that 
you need to preserve early in the process. Preservations issues are dis­
cussed in greater detail in Chapter 7. 
	
✓	Protective: A protective order provides that certain ESI is not subject to 
discovery. You generally ask the court for a protective order when the 
other party is seeking to discover privileged or protected ESI that is not 
subject to disclosure. This is discussed in Chapter 10.
	
Always be prepared. Rule 16(f) gives the court broad authority to inflict pain 
(sanction) on you or your attorney for failing to obey a scheduling order or 
pre-trial order. 
Being unprepared or failing to participate effectively in an order puts you at 
risk of being sanctioned. Judges have great latitude in sanctions, including 
the expenses incurred by the other side because of your actions. These cost 
penalties may be in addition to the sanctions related to Rule 37. (Rule 37 pro­
vides the court with great latitude in crafting sanctions against you if you fail 
to properly participate in e-discovery. This is discussed in detail in Chapter 
5.) The ultimate sanction is losing your case.
The bottom line is that your lawyers and IT professionals have a 120-day 
window to learn your ESI issues and to learn about e-discovery.

65
 Chapter 4: The Playbook: Federal Rules and Advisory Guidelines 
FRCP 26
Knowing is half the battle. In e-discovery, knowing Rule 26 may be most of 
the war. Rule 26 is essential in discovering your opponent’s ESI. One of the 
most important aspects of discovery is the meet-and-confer session. Rule 
26(f) requires that you meet with your opposing party at least 21 days before 
the scheduling conference (called the meet and confer). This can be a make-
it-or-break-it moment for your case. All discovery issues are addressed at the 
meet-and-confer session. You must be prepared and come with a plan. See 
Chapters 8 and 10 for more details.
	
Local court rules may limit the date for the meet-and-confer session to expe­
dite cases. Consult with your attorney to make sure you know when your meet 
and confer is.
If you’re a party to litigation, Rule 26(a) requires that you either provide a 
copy or a categorical description and location of any ESI that may be used 
to support your claims or defenses. The other side does the same thing, and 
it can help reduce the cost of e-discovery. The disclosure must be in writing 
and made at or within 14 days of the meet-and-confer session. Don’t panic; 
you don’t need to know everything at that time. Just disclose what you know 
and tell the rest later. Disclosure is an ongoing requirement. All pre-trial dis­
closures are due within 30 days of the trial date, and the other party has 14 
days to object. Failure to object could result in a waiver of objections for trial 
purposes. These time limitations illustrate the need to be litigation ready as 
discussed in Chapter 3.
Generally, under Rule 26(b)(1), you can discover any nonprivileged matter 
relevant or likely to lead to evidence relevant to your claim or defense. 
However, there are some limitations. If you can demonstrate that the ESI is 
not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost, you may not 
have to produce the ESI. (Chapter 6 discusses what is deemed not reason­
ably accessible.) The court can still order you to produce it if, for example, 
the benefit from production outweighs the cost. The court may make also 
your opponent pay for the ESI production. (See Chapter 12 on how to shift 
e-discovery cost to the other party.)
	
An important aspect of e-discovery is that you may be able to withhold ESI if it 
is privileged or protected. See Chapter 10 for more info.
You must be familiar with the rules applicable to properly protecting ESI. A 
large volume of ESI makes it difficult to avoid an inadvertent disclosure of 
privileged or protected ESI, but you have ways to undo what you just did — 
sometimes, no harm no foul. Chapter 10 discusses this significant topic.

66
Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery and Professional Competence 
FRCP 33 and 34
You may request a party to answer written questions, or interrogatories. Rule 
33(d) allows the responding party to specify the records to be reviewed and 
the location of the records as well as a reasonable opportunity to examine, 
audit, and make copies of the records. This applies only when the answer to 
the question may be determined from the records and the burden of getting 
the answer is the same for either party.
Rule 34(b) allows you to request the form of the ESI to be produced. You 
may also “inspect, copy, test, or sample the other parties’ ESI.” If you are the 
responding party, you may object to the request and state the form of ESI 
you intend to use. You must translate ESI into a reasonably useable form. If 
no form of ESI is requested, you then produce ESI in the following manner:
	
✓	The form in which the ESI is ordinarily maintained
	
✓	A form that is reasonably useable
Applying the Rules to Criminal Cases
ESI is becoming increasingly more important in criminal cases. From Enron 
to Bernie Madoff, the need to discover, review, and analyze ESI is essential 
in criminal investigations and prosecutions. Because more than 90 percent 
of documents today are generated in electronic format, ESI is taking a para­
mount role. 
Although the rules and case law on e-discovery in the civil arena have been 
developing at a rapid pace, the same cannot be said in criminal law. Issues 
include Fourth and Fifth Amendment constitutional arguments and state 
constitutional concerns. The procedural rules are set forth in the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCrimP) as well as the states’ versions of 
criminal procedure codes.
Requesting properly
A proper request can reduce cost and obtain 
relevant ESI more efficiently. Make sure your 
request is what you want and how you want it. In 
Autotech Techs Ltd. P’ship v. Automationdirect.
com (2008), the plaintiff produced ESI requested 
by the defendant. There was no request for 
the metadata. Sometime later, the defendant 
decided they wanted the metadata. Judge 
D’Onofrio was not sympathetic. The judge 
noted that the plaintiff had complied with pro­
duction of the ESI and the defendant could have 
requested the metadata earlier. Therefore, 
the defendant “must be satisfied with what it 
asked for.”

67
 Chapter 4: The Playbook: Federal Rules and Advisory Guidelines 
The Fourth Amendment has a general prohibition against searches and sei­
zures without a warrant. Some exceptions include
	
✓	Search incident to an arrest: Law enforcement has the right to search 
an area within the suspect’s immediate control when they arrest some­
one. This is generally for law enforcement’s protection and may not give 
them the right to seize ESI — say a computer — unless it poses a threat.
	
✓	Protective sweep: Law enforcement may search an immediate area if 
they have reason to believe another suspect is nearby.
	
✓	Plain view: Law enforcement does not need a warrant for contraband in 
plain sight. This would probably not apply to any ESI.
	
✓	Consent search: A person may give law enforcement the right to search. 
The consent must be voluntarily given with full understanding of 
the person’s rights.

In United States v. O’Keefe (2008), Judge Facciola said, “It is foolish to disregard 
them (the FRCP) merely because this is a criminal case, particularly where, as 
is the case here, it is far better to use these rules than to reinvent the wheel 
when the production of documents in criminal and civil cases raises the same 
problems.”
The FRCP will be looked at for guidance while the FRCrimP evolves on these 
issues.
If the government wants what you have, it requests a search and seizure 
warrant by filing an application or affidavit. The procedure is in Rule 41. The 
application identifies the location of the property to be searched and seized, 
and includes facts that support why the government needs (and should get) 
the property.
Figure 4-1 shows an application for a federal search warrant. States have simi­
lar applications or affidavits. Note that the application is sworn before 
a judge.
Figure 4-2 shows a federal search and seizure warrant that a judge issues 
from the application. Note that unless the judge authorizes delayed notice, 
a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken must be given to 
the person or left at the premises. Law enforcement then conducts the autho­
rized search and seizes the property per the warrant. They will be required 
to provide the court with an inventory of what was seized.
Figure 4-3 shows a copy of a federal return, which lists property taken. For 
ESI, the return needs to list only the property seized that stores the ESI.
	
At this stage, your attorney usually challenges the warrant and the application 
for it, generally on constitutional grounds.

Your attorney may also seek to have the court determine that the evidence 
seized cannot be used in court. For example, by arguing that what was seized 
was beyond the warrant. The application must establish probable cause (a 
reasonable belief that a crime has been committed and evidence of such may 
be at the site).

71
 Chapter 4: The Playbook: Federal Rules and Advisory Guidelines 
F.R. Crim. P. Rule 41
Effective December 1, 2009, F.R. Crim. P. Rule 41 will be amended to address 
some ESI issues. It establishes a two-step process when ESI is involved. The 
first step is the seizure and then a subsequent review of the ESI. That review 
must be consistent with the warrant. Anything else can be challenged by 
your attorney and possibly be inadmissible. There is no time frame estab­
lished for this review because it can take a substantial amount of time. This is 
especially true with hidden traps or encryptions. The government gives you 
an inventory return form, which describes the physical storage media seized 
or copied (for example, a laptop is described; not the data contained on it). 
F. R. Crim. P. Rule 16
F. R. Crim. P. Rule 16 allows you to discover any ESI that the government has 
in its possession that:
	
✓	Is material to your case
	
✓	The government intends to use at trial against you
	
✓	Was taken from or belongs to you
F. R. Crim. P. Rule 17 and 17.1
Rule 17.1 provides for pre-trial conferences to promote a fair and expeditious 
trial. Under Rule 17, the court may issue a subpoena for a third party to pro­
duce records at trial or at another time and place. The court may allow you 
to inspect all or part of the ESI. For practical purposes, with more and more 
ESI and possible third-party ESI that could assist in the defense, it is likely 
there will be future changes to mirror the civil rules. The government will 
usually get its ESI by consent or warrant.
Learning about Admissibility
ESI may be discoverable but not necessarily admissible in court. In court, the 
judge determines what evidence is allowed to be presented. In a jury trial, the 
jury only hears what the judge allows them to hear. The rules are contained in 
the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE). Throughout the entire discovery process, 
you must give some thought to whether something will be admitted as evidence. 

72
Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery and Professional Competence 
The first two rules of evidence for you to remember are
	
✓	Only relevant evidence is admissible.
	
✓	All relevant evidence is admissible unless there’s some other rule that 
says it isn’t.
Ponder for a moment the second rule. If you think the rule is saying that 
evidence is admissible unless it’s not admissible, you’re right! The FRE is 
full of rules with multiple exceptions. Even the exceptions have exceptions. 
However, with a few basics, you can make sense out of the general rules.
We also discuss admissibility issues in Chapter 12.
The first rule of evidence law splits all the ESI in a legal action into two parts: 
relevant and irrelevant. That sounds simple, but it isn’t. With the many variants 
on the road to getting something admitted, you come across some roadblocks:
	
✓	Exclusions are anti-rules. Evidence that is under an exclusion reverses 
the rule. Say one rule allows that an e-mail message be used as evidence. 
Any exclusion to that rule reverses it. Then that e-mail message would 
not be allowed as evidence. Some evidence may be excluded because it 
is privileged or protected (see Chapter 10).
	
✓	Exceptions are rules that are anti-exclusions. If an exception is found to 
the exclusion, then the exclusion is ignored. An e-mail message that had 
been ruled inadmissible would become admissible again. Some evidence 
that is privileged or protected can still be admitted with a waiver excep­
tion. Evidence of someone saying something against his or her interest 
can be deemed relevant with an exception.
Two issues often complicate whether ESI is relevant or irrelevant:
	
✓	Authentication: Authentication means that the ESI is what you say it is. 
If you can’t authenticate your evidence, it isn’t allowed in the court.
	
✓	Best evidence: Rule 1002 requires that you must use an original to 
prove the contents. An original is any printout or other output readable 
by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately. Rule 1003 allows you to 
submit a copy unless there’s a debate about its authenticity, and then 
the court won’t allow the copy.
Figure 4-4 illustrates the basic steps in determining what e-evidence is admis­
sible. Judges have the authority to decide that evidence is not admissible in 
the trial.

Lessening the Need for Judicial 
Intervention by Cooperation
Playing nice is the best way to avoid involving the judge in the e-discovery 
process. The FRCP gives great latitude to both you and your opposing party 
in dealing with e-discovery. If you are a requesting party, know what ESI you 
want. If you are the responding party, know what you have and how to access 
it. If you have privileged or protected ESI, know how to find it to avoid inad­
vertent disclosure. Judges would prefer that you work out a plan of discovery 
without the need for unnecessary, time-consuming, and costly motions. 
Your entire e-discovery team — lawyers and IT people alike — must work 
together from the onset of anticipated litigation. Because of the accelerated 
time frames, a lack of knowledge could lead to a critical error. You must be 
aware of what you have and what form you have it in. Know the systems, 
legal and technical. The best practice is to have protocols and procedures in 
advance. Use of best practices (see Chapter 3) and planning (see Chapter 6) 
decreases the need to involve the judge. The meet-and-confer session pro­
vides a means of limiting the involvement of the court.

74
Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery and Professional Competence 
	
The judge in William A. Gross Const. Assoc., Inc. v. Am. Mfg. Mutual Ins. Co. 
(2009), chastised the parties for forcing the court into the “uncomfortable 
position” of having to craft a keyword search methodology. Judge Peck said 
it best when he said, “Electronic discovery requires cooperation between 
opposing counsel and transparency in all aspects of preservation of [ESI].”
The Sedona Conference Cooperation Proclamation recognizes the impor­
tance of cooperation in the process of e-discovery to meet the goals of 
FRCP Rule 1 for a just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of a case. The 
Proclamation makes it clear that cooperation by attorneys is consistent with 
the duty to be a zealous advocate for the client. This is implicit in the FRCP, 
which requires a level of cooperation to avoid sanctions. The proclamation 
calls for a “paradigm shift for the discovery process.”
Things to consider to accomplish this cooperation include:
	
✓	Utilize an internal ESI discovery “point person” to assist counsel. This 
may also be helpful in later use of expert testimony if needed.
	
✓	Exchange information on relevant data sources, including those not 
being searched.
	
✓	Provide early disclosures on ESI.
	
✓	Jointly develop automated methodologies for search and retrieval of 
relevant ESI.
	
✓	Promote early identification of forms of production.
	
✓	Consider court-appointed experts, mediators, or other alternate means 
to resolve disputes that may arise without resort to the court.
Rule 53 provides a unique opportunity for you to avoid situations like those 
in Gross. You can agree to ask the court to appoint a Special Master to assist 
in the e-discovery process, resolve disputes, and reduce cost. A Special 
Master is a person, generally a forensic person or attorney, appointed by the 
court to assist in the discovery process. The Master may be used to provide 
assistance to the court, to you and your opponent, or both on a wide variety 
of e-discovery issues. See Chapter 10 for more on the Masters.
Limiting e-Discovery
Just because you want a certain piece of evidence, doesn’t mean you can 
get it from your opponent. Only ESI that is relevant or is expected to lead to 
relevant evidence is subject to discovery. If the ESI is privileged or protected, 
it generally isn’t part of discovery. This is discussed in Chapter 10. Courts 
are not sympathetic if you attempt to impose settlements on the other party 
by running up the cost of e-discovery. Nor are the courts patient if you use 
e-discovery as a fishing expedition.

75
 Chapter 4: The Playbook: Federal Rules and Advisory Guidelines 
The FRCP provides the courts with the power to place boundaries on the 
conduct of e-discovery. Rule 26(b)(2)(C) allows the court to limit discovery if:
	
✓	The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative
	
✓	The discovery unreasonably duplicates other discovery
	
✓	The ESI can be obtained from other more convenient, less burdensome, 
or less costly sources
	
✓	The requesting party has had plenty of time to obtain the ESI
	
✓	The likely benefit of discovery is outweighed by the burden or expense 
of the discovery
You may also seek a protective order limiting or denying discovery. The 
court may issue a protective order for good cause to protect against the 
following:
	
✓	Annoyance
	
✓	Embarrassment
	
✓	Oppression
	
✓	Undue burden
If you want a protective order, you must certify to the court that you made a 
good faith effort to resolve the dispute before involving the court. Protective 
orders may be used for privileged and protected ESI. They are also effec­
tive to limit fishing expeditions from overly broad requests. For example, 
a request for “all e-mails” is overly broad. A request for “all e-mails from 
Manager A to Manager B from the period May 1, 20XX and June 2, 20XX” 
generally are enforced.
If you are a non-party, you can move to quash or modify the subpoena. You 
may also seek a Rule 26 protective order the same way any party can.
Another method that is employed by the courts is cost shifting. This can be 
used when the cost of compliance is out of proportion to the likely benefit 
or when the ESI is not reasonably accessible. Sometimes you have to pay the 
piper if you want to hear the music. Cost shifting is analyzed in Chapter 12.
Finding Out About Sanctions
You can avoid the wrath of the courts if you’re prepared, knowledgeable, and 
play nice. The court has wide latitude in sanctioning you if you fail to cooper­
ate or comply in e-discovery (Rule 37). Cooperation doesn’t mean giving in; it 
means working with FRCP Rule 1 in mind. 

76
Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery and Professional Competence 
You may request sanctions on the other party or the court may do so. The 
court may order you to comply with any type of discovery, not just ESI-
related discovery. Non-parties may be held in contempt of court (Rule 45).
If the court has an order that you’ve not complied with, you may be consid­
ered to be in contempt of court. (For example, not following the discovery 
plan incorporated into a scheduling order or a pre-trial order.) The court has 
many options including:
	
✓	Treating the matters relating to the unproduced ESI as proven by your 
opponent. This is adverse inference.
	
✓	Prohibiting you from relying on the unproduced ESI in your claim or 
defense.
	
✓	Eliminating a claim or defense.
	
✓	Postponing your case until compliance.
	
✓	Dismissing your case completely or partly.
The rules are clear that these sanctions can be cumulative. Additionally, you 
may be forced to pay your opponent’s expenses caused by the failure to obey 
the order.
If there is not an order but a failure to produce, the same sanctions can 
apply. The rules provide safe harbor for certain ESI.
	
Rule 37(e) provides that the court cannot impose sanctions for failing to pro­
duce ESI that you’ve lost from routine, good-faith operation of the system. 
Good faith is crucial. When litigation is anticipated, you have a duty to hold 
the ESI and preserve it. At that point, steps must be taken to avoid any 
destruction of the ESI, even if by routine operation.
If the ESI is not available, the courts look to determine whether you’ve 
destroyed it by routine operation. It is important that you have a data reten­
tion policy and show compliance with it. This is beyond the duty to preserve. 
Chapters 6 and 7 look into this further.

In Doe v. Norwalk Community College (2007), the court refused to apply the 
safe harbor as the defendants had not followed their document retention 
policy. The defendants did not have a policy that was consistently followed, 
and the court would not acknowledge what they had was a retention policy. 
Having a policy but not following it is the same as not having it.

 Chapter 4: The Playbook: Federal Rules and Advisory Guidelines 
As a sanction, the court can take an adverse inference, meaning that the 
reason it is unavailable is that it would be adverse to the party not producing 
it. An adverse inference in the situation before the court requires the follow­
ing factors:
	
✓	There is a duty to preserve.
	
✓	The lose or destruction of the ESI was intentional.
	
✓	The ESI is relevant. 
If your opponent does not participate in the meet-and-confer session in 
good faith, the court can make them pay your costs, including attorney fees, 
because of their actions.
	
If you request sanctions, you must provide a certification that you attempted 
to confer to resolve the issues. You must have done so in good faith. 
Rulings on Metadata
Generally, when you hand over your ESI to your opponent, it’s in its native 
format. The phrase native format means that the ESI has its metadata intact. 
Metadata is the information about who created a file; when it was created, 
accessed, or modified; and other documentation. 
Rules 26(b) and 34(a) and (b) make it clear that metadata is subject to 
e-discovery. Working backward, that means that you must manage metadata 
so that it’s preservable, searchable, and producible. Any attempt at deleting 
metadata puts you on a collision course with legal disaster. Sloppy or ad hoc 
handling of metadata (legally known as improper handling) won’t be a career-
building move. Rule 37(f) provides a safe harbor if you manage metadata as 
part of normal business practices according to reasonable policies, including 
automated metadata management and accidentally losing metadata. 
You won’t find a specific rule that you can turn to and learn everything that 
applies to metadata issues. Those issues are co-mingled with a variety of 
rules and notes, shown in Table 4-2.
Metadata is not an expense item when it comes to litigation readiness. 
Metadata helps you organize, identify, and review your ESI to reduce time 
and cost.

cannot significantly degrade 
its electronic searchability.
Purge unnecessary metadata, 
such as records of changes 
to documents or stray com­

Getting Guidance but Not Authority 
from Sedona Think Tanks
The Sedona Conference is a non-partisan think tank on law and policy. A 
number of working groups address various issues of ESI from assessing what 
is inaccessible to Rule 45 subpoenas. The working groups consist of lawyers, 
jurists, and consultants that work to provide best practices and commen­
tary on e-discovery issues. Lawyers, judges, and parties look to the Sedona 
Conference for guidance in the area of ESI retention and production. 
The Sedona Guidelines Principles, Second Edition, Best Practices 
Recommendations and Principles for Addressing Electronic Document 
Production is required reading for anyone dealing with ESI. Whether you’re 
a lawyer, judge, or IT person, this is a powerful tool when confronted with 
e-discovery. There are 14 principles related to e-discovery. This and other 
working papers may be downloaded from www.sedonaconference.org.
	
Implementing the Sedona Principles and related commentaries does not 
mean automatic success. They are only guidelines and recommendations 
without the force of law. However, the courts do look to them and cite them 
frequently.
Disagreeing with Sedona does not mean you are wrong but should give you a 
reason to look again. Ultimately, you must defend what you do and how you 
do it. Sedona is helpful but not the final determination. 
Collecting the Wisdom of the Chief 
Justices and National Law Conference
The mission of the Conference of Chief Justices is to improve the administra­
tion of justice within the states, commonwealths, and territories of the United 
States. Its working group on e-discovery has promulgated a set of guidelines 
for e-discovery. If you have a matter in state court, you should consult these 
as possible guidelines in interpreting the state’s e-discovery rules.
The guidelines are meant to help reduce uncertainty in dealing with state 
level e-discovery issues. The guidelines make it clear that they are not meant 
to be model rules, but only guidances to be used with other resources cited 
in the guidelines, including the FRCP. The guidelines may be downloaded at 
www.ncsconline.org/images/EDiscCCJGuidelinesFinal.pdf.

Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery and Professional Competence 
Do not confuse the Chief Justices and National Law Conference with the 
National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. They are also 
a nonpartisan think tank on various issues of state law. They have issued a 
set of Model Rules for e-discovery. Although the goal is to have states adopt a 
uniform set of laws and rules, these Model Rules are simply the Conference’s 
recommendations without force of law. This reference tool for your arse­
nal can be downloaded at www.nccusl.org/Update/Docs/Finals_NC/

Minding the e-Discovery Reference Model
The Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) Project was put together 
to address problems that were identified in e-discovery. The model is meant 
to provide a flexible framework for e-discovery as shown in Figure 4-5. The 
EDRM is a reference — not law — and is available for download at www.
edrm.net.

in deciding how to allocate cost. The ABA 
standards are not law but provide guidance 
for interpretation. They may be downloaded

Following the Federal Rules 
Advisory Committee
When in the process of federal rulemaking, the Federal Rules Advisory 
Committee provides guidance on what the proposed rule intends. The pro­
cess is as follows:
	
✓	Initial review by the Advisory Committee
	
✓	Publication of the proposed rule for public comment
	
✓	Final approval of the proposal or revised proposal by the Advisory 
Committee
	
✓	Approval by the Standing Committee
	
✓	Judicial Conference approval
	
✓	Supreme Court approval
	
✓	Congressional review and approval
	
	One of the best tools of interpretation in your e-discovery toolbox is the 
Advisory Committee Notes that accompany the rules. Considered very 
persuasive, the notes give insight into how to interpret the rule and the 
intent of the committee.

Judging Professional Competence 
and Conduct
In This Chapter
▶	Diligently seeking ESI
▶	Providing penalties for e-discovery misconduct
▶	Assessing problems with legal counsel
▶	Following attorney rules of professional conduct
▶	Gaining insight from others
▶	Applying sanctions cases
T
he world of ESI provides dramatic new challenges for both you and your 
lawyers. The complex world of e-discovery can make you more reliant 
on your attorneys and any outside vendors your attorneys hire. Selecting the 
wrong legal counsel can result in you losing your case. In this chapter, we 
cover how you can make sure your lawyer is doing the best job for you.
To give you a fighting chance in court, various Rules of Professional 
Responsibility govern attorneys. From the American Bar Association (ABA) 
Model Rules of Professional Conduct to the various state rules, they establish 
the ethical responsibilities of an attorney in the representation of a client. 
We cover those rules as well in this chapter so that you know when your 
attorney may not be acting in your best interests.
	
Ultimately, you can be held responsible for your attorney’s conduct, meaning 
you can be sanctioned by the court and you can even lose your case. But with 
the help of this chapter, you can avoid any type of sanctions.

84
Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery and Professional Competence 
Making Sure Your Attorney 
Gives a Diligent Effort
Your attorney must give your case his best diligent effort. In the following 
sections, we talk about the due diligence your lawyer owes you.
You bear the ultimate responsibility in e-discovery; your due diligence must 
be used during the entire process. You must exercise diligence in hiring com­
petent counsel and/or third-party vendors. Diligence must also be applied to 
the working relationship with those third parties.
	
If you’re thinking of representing yourself because you think you can get away 
with less than due diligence, you need to think twice. Clients who represent 
themselves may find that the court does not show them any additional consid­
eration. In United States v. Two Bank Accounts, the court did not show leniency 
to the self-represented party in relation to discovery.
Attorneys have an additional due diligence burden imposed by the professional 
ethics while representing you. We discuss these rules later in this chapter.
Looking at what constitutes 
a diligent effort
The nature of the legal profession is that attorneys are zealous advocates for 
their clients. This is both a legal and ethical obligation. To effectively exer­
cise this obligation, the attorney must make a diligent effort, which is often 
called due diligence. A diligent effort means that your attorney is represent­
ing you in all aspects of the case in a professional manner and doing what a 
competent attorney would do under the same circumstances. It applies both 
the legal obligations imposed under the law and relevant rules as well as the 
applicable ethical standards. Failing to exercise due diligence exposes the 
lawyer to a malpractice suit.
Unfortunately, you can’t always know if your attorney is doing a good job. 
Generally, only the judge and your opponent’s attorney can accurately evalu­
ate your attorney’s performance. If your attorney isn’t doing the following 
things, you should consider whether he’s doing his due diligence for you:
	
✓	Keeps you in the loop at all levels of the case. This includes copies of 
correspondence. You can often judge from a reading of the various cor­
respondence if something seems wrong. 
	
✓	Gives you a proper amount of time. If your attorney is regularly asking 
for things at the last minute, it’s an indication of a lack of appropriate 
planning and preparation of your case. 

85
 Chapter 5: Judging Professional Competence and Conduct 
	
✓	Files a lot of motions. Another possible flag is an abundance of motions 
before the court. This may show that there is a lack of cooperation. 
	
✓	Discusses with you the litigation plan. A seasoned attorney has a good 
idea how the litigation will proceed from a procedural basis and you 
can set benchmarks. This will be reviewed and revised as the case pro­
gresses. The key is communication.
	
You’re the client and are paying for representation. You should not be shy 
about questioning anything your attorney does or proposes to do. You have 
a right to know why something needs to be done and if there is a better more 
cost effective way of doing it. Your attorney may have a good explanation and 
in fact it may be the other attorney that is causing problems. You should feel 
free to question the progress of your case at any time.
Searching for evidence
When a case has been filed, your attorney starts a search for the piece of 
evidence that can help your side win the case, the smoking gun.

If you hear your attorneys talking about a smoking gun, they haven’t started 
channeling Clint Eastwood. Sometimes the smoking gun does exist. In Ernst 
v. Merck & Co., Inc., e-mails showing that Merck scientists had concerns 
over a drug were introduced in the case, which resulted in the plaintiff being 
awarded more than $253 million dollars. 
In most cases, there isn’t one smoking gun. Your attorney must build a case 
by voluminous circumstantial (indirect) evidence that proves your position 
to be correct. This is the heart and soul of e-discovery: to find as much every­
thing possible to build a compelling case.
FRCP 26(a)(1) establishes an obligation on you to provide your opponent with 
a copy or a description by category and location of all documents, ESI, and 
tangible things within its possession and control that it may use to support 
its claim. Your lawyer has to hand over everything as long as it’s relevant and 
not privileged or protected, even if not admissible in court. With one excep­
tion: FRCP 26(b)(2) permits your lawyer to withhold ESI that is no longer rea­
sonably accessible because of undue burden or cost (see Chapter 6).
	
By the time of the meet-and-confer session, your lawyer must have a compre­
hensive knowledge of your computer technology, the architecture of your ESI 
storage system, the location of any ESI, and the native formats and metadata 
that the ESI is in. Additionally, he should be conversant enough in technol­
ogy to understand your opponents’ technology issues. Close communication 
is essential among everyone on your side so your attorney doesn’t give away 
anything that may be harmful to your case and that your attorney knows what 
to ask for from the other side.

86
Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery and Professional Competence 
Producing ESI
The FRCP also imposes an affirmative duty on you and your attorney to make 
a diligent effort to produce ESI as long as it’s not privileged or protected. The 
stakes are high and the potential sanctions significant. Most of the problems 
that could be encountered can be avoided by hiring knowledgeable legal 
counsel from the onset of the litigation or earlier.
	
When served with a subpoena, non-parties have the same obligation to pro­
duce ESI, although courts tend to be more sympathetic to protecting non-
parties from incurring significant expenses in responding to a subpoena.
Your attorney must be conversant in the issues inherent in producing ESI. 
Subtle nuances in the technology and issues surround the preservation, col­
lecting, reviewing, and producing of ESI. Ignorance is not a defense. In Garcia 
v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co. of America, the court rejected the attorney’s asser­
tion of technical incompetence. If the attorney was technically ignorant, then 
the attorney should have sought assistance from someone with technical 
competence.
When the duty to preserve relevant ESI is established, your attorney must 
make a diligent effort to identify, protect, and preserve potentially relevant 
ESI. Judge Scheindlin explained in Zubulake that your lawyer must continue 
her diligent effort throughout the case and not just at the beginning. From 
the litigation hold (see Chapter 7) to taking ongoing, regular affirmative steps 
to ensure that all relevant, nonprivileged, or protected ESI (or sources of ESI) 
are discovered, preserved, and produced. It is not sufficient for your lawyer 
be proactive only in establishing the litigation hold and preservation. There 
is a professional obligation on your lawyer conduct all e-discovery in a dili­
gent and candid manner.
Providing a certification
Every disclosure and every request, response, or objection must be signed 
by you or your attorney. FRCP 26(g) requires this certification that to the 
best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, after making a rea­
sonable inquiry:
	
✓	A disclosure is complete and correct as of the time made.
	
✓	A discovery request, response, or objection is
 
• Consistent with the rules and the law or by a nonfrivolous argu­
ment to extend or modify the law.
 
• Not for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unneces­
sary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.

87
 Chapter 5: Judging Professional Competence and Conduct 
 
• Neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive con­
sidering the needs of the case, prior discovery, the amount in con­
troversy, and the importance of the issues.
Avoiding Being Sanctioned
The courts have wide latitude in sanctioning participants — including you — 
in the e-discovery process. There are two ways: pursuant to the FRCP or by 
the court’s inherent power. We discuss both ways in the following sections.
	
The ultimate sanction is losing your case because of bad conduct rather than 
the case’s merits.
FRCP sanctions
Here are some ways a judge can sanction you or your attorneys according to 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP):
	
✓	Limitless scope of discovery: FRCP 26 contains some provisions that 
allow judges to punish discovery misconduct. The courts may, if the 
judge deems it appropriate, award expenses to your opponent. For 
example, in the case of a motion for a protective order, the court may 
provide the prevailing party with costs. Although not a sanction, the 
court may also limit the scope of any discovery if it is duplicative or the 
burden or cost outweighs its likely benefit.
	
✓	An improper certificate under FRCP 26(g): Section 3 states that the 
court must impose an appropriate sanction on the signer, you if your 
attorney signed it, or both. The sanction may include paying your oppo­
nent’s reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, as a result of the 
violation. (See the previous section to find out what a proper certificate 
contains.)
	
✓	Failure to obey a discovery order or to provide a person required for 
examination: The court has many potential sanctions under Rule 37(b)
(2)(A). They include:
 
• Directing that the matters in the order or other facts be considered 
established or proven.
 
• Prohibiting you from supporting or opposing certain claims or 
defenses or introducing certain related matters into evidence in 
court.
 
• Striking any of your claims or defenses in whole or part.
 
• Delaying the proceedings until you’ve obeyed the order.

88
Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery and Professional Competence 
 
• Dismissing your action in whole or part.
 
• Giving a default judgment for or against you. This means that if the 
court found the other side has engaged in egregious misconduct it 
could decide the case in your favor without a trial. 
 
• Treating your failure to obey as a contempt of court.
 
• Instead of or in addition to any of the preceding, order you to pay 
the reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, caused by the 
failure to obey. If you can prove your failure was substantially 
justified or other circumstances, the judge molt likely won’t award 
expenses.
	
✓	Failure to disclose or supplement previously disclosed information 
when new information is discovered, as required by Rule 26: Under 
FRCP 37(c) the court may order that the information or witness may 
not be used in court. This will not apply if you can justify your failure or 
your failure doesn’t prejudice your opponent. In addition to or in place 
of this sanction, the court may:
 
• Order you to pay reasonable expenses for your opponent.
 
• Inform the jury of your failure to comply.
 
• Impose other appropriate sanctions including those for failure to 
obey an order.
	
✓	Failure to appear for a deposition or to respond to interrogatories: 
Your opponent may motion the court for sanctions. To request this, the 
motion must be accompanied by a certification that they’ve conferred 
in good faith or attempted to confer with you to resolve the issue. The 
sanction may include costs but also may include any of the sanctions in 
FRCP Rule 37(b)(2) (A)(i)-(vi).
	
✓	Failure to provide ESI lost as a result of the routine, good-faith opera­
tion of an electronic system: FRCP Rule 37(e) may give you a safe 
harbor that, absent exceptional circumstances, a court may not impose 
sanctions.
	
✓	Failure to participate in good faith in the meet-and-confer session: 
Rule 37(f) provides a broad sanction for the assessment of costs, includ­
ing attorney fees incurred by the failure to participate. This means that 
your attorneys must be knowledgeable about your ESI issues by the time 
the meet-and-confer session occurs.
	
Using a third-party vendor doesn’t relieve you of liability for e-discovery mis­
conduct. You bear the ultimate responsibility. The court will consider who 
was at fault in determining the type of sanction. For example, if your third-
party vendor causes you to regularly miss deadlines or respond less than fully 
to a request for ESI, the court is not likely to dismiss your case — even the 

89
 Chapter 5: Judging Professional Competence and Conduct 
first time. In re Seroquel Products Liability Litigation, the court held that a party 
is responsible for the errors of its vendors. Blaming a failure on someone else 
is not a defense.
Inherent power sanctions
In addition to the sanctions in the FRCP, the courts have broad authority to 
sanction under their inherent power to control the conduct of a case. The 
inherent power is not established by specific rule. Inherent power dictates the 
court is responsible and has the power to oversee the conduct of all cases 
that are brought before it. 
This includes the ability to sanction for misconduct without a specific rule 
if the court believes you or your attorney’s conduct is wrongful. The avail­
able sanctions range from monetary sanctions, to adverse inferences (for 
example, a judge can tell a jury it may assume you destroyed ESI because it 
wouldn’t have been in your favor), to dismissal of your case or claim. (These 
essentially parallel Rule 37 sanctions in the FRCP we discuss in the previous 
section.)
But many courts consider sanctions for these behaviors as well:
	
✓	Simple negligence is established if you have a legal duty, such as to 
preserve certain ESI, but failed to take the steps a reasonable person 
would have done to preserve that ESI and as a result some relevant ESI 
was destroyed. Negligence is without intent. For example, you may have 
failed to take all steps necessary to identify the relevant ESI at the incep­
tion of the litigation hold.
	
✓	Reckless conduct is beyond simple negligence but may not be inten­
tional. However, it may be so reckless that the court treats the conduct 
as if it were intentional. For example, if a company had a duty to pre­
serve ESI, but took only minimal steps to identify and preserve it with­
out considering whether relevant ESI being destroyed. This could be the 
result of bad faith or just incompetence.
	
✓	Bad faith is the result of reckless misconduct or an intentional act. To 
be intentional, you must have intended either the act or the result. For 
example failing to properly institute a litigation hold knowing that rel­
evant ESI will be destroyed. 
Although bad faith or reckless conduct is not necessary for Rule 37 sanc­
tions, they are relevant to the type of sanction the court may give. The court 
may provide a lower level of Rule 37 sanction, like costs without finding 
culpability, dismissal of your case, or an adverse inference. If the court gives 
an adverse inference, it’s saying that you didn’t produce evidence because it 
wouldn’t have been in your best interests.

In Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley & Co., the court had 
ordered Morgan Stanley to search the oldest full backup tape for its employ­
ees involved in a transaction to produce all nonprivileged, relevant e-mails 
and to certify compliance. After certifying compliance, they uncovered thou­
sands of backup tapes that had not been searched because of errors in their 
search techniques. However, they failed to immediately notify the court. The 
actions of both Morgan Stanley and their counsel upset the judge who noted, 
“Lack of candor has frustrated the court and opposing counsel’s ability to be 
fully and timely informed.” With sanctions, the court shifted the burden of 
proof on the fraud issue to Morgan Stanley. The court instructed the jury that 
it could consider that certain portions of the plaintiff’s complaint true for the 
purposes of the case, read a statement to the jury concerning spoliation by 
Morgan Stanley, and instructed that the jury may consider this when awarding 
any damages. The result was a jury verdict of $1.45 billion dollars (yes, with a 
B) that included $850 million in punitive damages.

Various sanctions by courts
In Keithley et al. v. The Home Store.Com, Inc., 
the court noted that an adverse inference may 
be under either its inherent power or Rule 37. It 
adopted the approach that to give an adverse 
inference in the situation before the court, there 
must be
	✓	A duty to preserve the evidence
	✓	The records were not preserved with a 
culpable state of mind
	✓	The destroyed evidence was relevant to the 
case
In Nursing Home Pension Fund v. Oracle Corp., 
the defendant’s former CEO willfully destroyed 
e-mails and other relevant evidence in a class 
action suit against Oracle. As a sanction, the 
court instructed the jury that it could infer that 
the missing evidence was unfavorable to the 
defendants. The court chose not to impose 
the ultimate sanction of finding for the plaintiff 
because it determined that public policy favors 
determining cases on their merits; the adverse 
inference meets that goal and still does not 
allow any benefit from the misconduct.
Judge Wake in Atlantic Recoding Corp. v. 
Howell stated, “Imposition of a default judgment 
is therefore the only appropriate sanction, both 
for its deterrent effect and to remedy the preju­
dice inflicted on the recording companies and 
on the court.” Judge Wake found that default 
was appropriate under both Rule 37(b) and the 
inherent powers because of the tireless efforts 
of the defendant to remove relevant ESI from 
his computer. Defendant also failed to cooper­
ate with plaintiff’s attempts to have a forensic 
examination of his computer.
The court in Phoenix Four, Inc. v. Strategic Red. 
Corp. found that the attorney was grossly neg­
ligent in not performing a diligent search for 
sources of ESI. The court imposed a sanction 
on the attorney of more than $30,000. Attorneys 
may also wish to review the 2009 case of Bray 
& Gillespie Mgmt. v Lexington. and Lexington 
Insurance Company. In that case, as a result 
of misconduct the Federal District Court Judge 
ordered the attorneys to pay costs of the other 
party incurred as a result of their misconduct.

 Chapter 5: Judging Professional Competence and Conduct 
Knowing the Risks Introduced 
by Legal Counsel
Discovery is the province of the attorneys. Competent counsel can save you 
money by working with you to develop a less time-consuming, and more 
productive, document search and review. Your attorney may also cause 
sanctions to be imposed on you for discovery misconduct. The very nature 
of discovery requires that attorneys operate with honesty and integrity in the 
process. Failing to comply with discovery responsibilities (say, by failing to 
make reasonable inquires or by outright dishonesty) may result in a variety 
of sanctions.
You extend your risk if your attorneys hire other e-discovery vendors. Third 
parties may be used for such things as data forensics, collection, processing, 
data hosting, consulting, and review. This may include lawyers and non-
lawyers. Further, a third party may be needed to provide specialized exper­
tise. For example, to collect data from an outdated native format. We discuss 
outside vendors in Chapters 13, 16, and 17.
	
If your lawyer hired a third-party vendor, you and your lawyer are not relieved 
of your e-discovery obligations. If a vendor is part of your team, make sure you 
do the following to ensure that he can meet the needs of the e-discovery:
	
✓	Review the economic stature of the vendor. A vendor going into bank­
ruptcy could result in missed deadlines, lost documents, additional 
costs, and possible sanctions. 
	
✓	Communicate. Constant and open communication is imperative. In 
today’s realm of ESI, the attorney probably hasn’t seen all of the ESI. In 
order to make a certification, your attorney must coordinate and over­
see the e-discovery process and take independent steps to verify the 
completeness of the ESI production.
Acting bad: Attorney e-discovery 
misconduct
The misconduct of the attorney may result in sanctions to the attorney, you, 
or both. In addition to the sanctions under the FRCP and the inherent power of 
the court, the attorney is subject to applicable rules of professional conduct.
In determining the professional competence and conduct of your lawyer, 
there are a number of different rules. Table 5-1 covers the applicability of 
various rules.

In Qualcomm Inc. v. Broadcom, Inc., the defendant wanted information from 
Qualcomm. During trial preparation, the attorneys for Qualcomm learned of 21 
relevant e-mails but did not produce them to the court. When a witness testi­
fied to their existence, Qualcomm lost the case. Qualcomm pointed fingers at 
its outside legal counsel, but the court noted that Qualcomm had an extensive 
in-house legal staff and the ability to do what was required in discovery. The 
court noted that Qualcomm just lacked the desire to do so. As a sanction for 
the misconduct, the court ordered Qualcomm to pay Broadcom in excess of 
$8.5 million in Broadcom legal fees and referred the matter of the lawyers to 
the State Bar of California for possible disciplinary action.
If you’re looking to hire legal counsel in cases where ESI may be an issue, 
here are ten questions you need to ask the attorney:
	
✓	How many attorneys in the firm handle ESI related matters? A sole pro­
prietor can provide competent and effective representation to the same 
degree as a larger firm.
	
✓	What is the background and experience of those attorneys handling ESI 
and e-discovery? The main attorney, often a partner, retains the obliga­
tion to supervise the work of associates.
	
✓	Does your firm outsource any aspect of e-discovery? You want to make 
sure that there is experience in ESI issues and if outsourcing is used that 
there is a strong level of oversight and control exercised by your attorney.
	
✓	If you outsource, how do you select the vendor? Your costs may be sig­
nificantly affected by the software used or available to the attorney.
	
✓	Is there any relationship between the firm (or any principal in the firm) 
and the outsourced vendors?
	
✓	What is your supervisory protocol for assuring the quality of the ven­
dor’s work? 

93
 Chapter 5: Judging Professional Competence and Conduct 
	
✓	Who will be the person in the firm responsible for my case? You want a 
person in the firm that serves as your direct contact. Someone you can 
call if you have a question.
	
✓	How will I be billed for this engagement? It is important to know how 
your attorney is going to bill for services rendered and at what rates. 
Most large firms have a sliding rate scale based upon the level of the 
person performing the services. Partners charge more than staff associ­
ates. You will want to how the attorney’s time is calculated. Is it on the 
quarter hour or the tenth of an hour? How much do they charge for a 
phone call?
	
✓	How will I be billed for vendors’ services? Your attorney may use out­
side vendors and should be able to explain why and how that will be 
cost effective for you.
There is no one right answer to these questions. If the attorney doesn’t know 
what she might do, it should be taken as a negative. The bottom line is that 
you must have a level of comfort and communication to move forward.
After you solicit responses, you’ll be in a better position to select your 
attorney.
Relying on the American Bar Association 
and state rules of professional conduct
The American Bar Association (ABA) Model Rules of Professional Conduct 
serve as guidance for lawyers and as a foundation for most state rules. 
Lawyers must follow the guidelines of conduct in the jurisdiction in which 
they are licensed. When there isn’t a state rule, there are Model Rules or best 
practices (such as the Sedona Principles).
The goal of the rules is to provide ethical standards for the practice of law. 
In handling lawsuits, including e-discovery, there are a number of applicable 
rules of ethics. Here are the most important rules:
	
✓	Your lawyer must provide competent representation (Model Rule 
1.1). This requires that your lawyer demonstrate the legal knowledge, 
skill, thoroughness, and preparation necessary for the representation. 
Ethically, your lawyer must be knowledgeable about e-discovery issues 
or bring in someone who is. Yes, lawyers need to be competent in tech­
nology to practice in e-discovery.
	
✓	Your lawyer must act with reasonable diligence and promptness 
(Model Rule 1.3). We talk more about this in the earlier section, “Making 
Sure Your Attorney Gives a Diligent Effort.”

94
Part II: Guidelines for e-Discovery and Professional Competence 
	
✓	Your lawyer must make a reasonable effort to expedite the litigation 
(Model Rule 3.2). This coincides with the FRCP Rule 1, which we discuss 
in Chapter 4. Communication between you and your lawyer are essential, 
and Model Rule 1.4 requires that your lawyer promptly and reasonably 
consults and communicates with you on the matters of representation. 
	
✓	Your lawyer must not obstruct another party’s access to evidence or 
unlawfully alter, destroy, or conceal a document or other material 
having potential evidentiary value (Model Rule 3.4). Nor may a lawyer 
counsel or assist another person to do so. This duty starts with the 
duty to preserve (Chapter 7) and extends throughout the process. The 
court in Bratka v. Anheuser-Busch Co. noted the obligation of the lawyer 
to exercise some degree of oversight over their client’s employees to 
ensure compliance.
	
✓	Your lawyer has a duty to correct any false statement previously made 
and not to offer any evidence the lawyer believes to be false (Model 
Rule 3-3).
	
✓	Your lawyer can’t knowingly reveal information concerning your 
representation or any of your confidences or secrets (Model Rule 1.6). 
The large amount of potential ESI makes it more likely that such informa­
tion may be inadvertently disclosed. If your lawyer inadvertently dis­
closes privileged information, check out Chapter 10. 
	
✓	If your lawyer receives a document that is privileged or protected, he 
must promptly notify the other side if it reasonably appears the disclo­
sure was inadvertent (Model Rule 4.4). Even though FRE 502 provides 
that inadvertent disclosure in federal cases doesn’t constitute a waiver, 
the information is out there. For example, it may lead to other admis­
sible evidence or may potentially be admissible to other purposes such 
as to refute an assertion made by a witness (impeachment). FRE 502 is 
a federal rule and states may approach its use differently. Whether your 
attorney can use it or not is up for debate.
Learning from Those Who Gambled 
Their Cases and Lost
Throughout this chapter, we refer to cases where the courts have sanctioned 
parties or attorneys. Just in case we didn’t make the point clear, the following 
is a brief listing of some additional cases:
	
✓	An adverse inference in Zubalake contributed to a $29.2 million dollar 
verdict. 
	
✓	The SEC imposed a $10 million fine on Bank of America Securities after 
they repeatedly failed to furnish requested ESI. 

95
 Chapter 5: Judging Professional Competence and Conduct 
To use or not to use privileged documents
The Model Rules do not address whether your 
attorney can use privileged evidence acciden­
tally received from the other side in court. State 
rules are split on how to handle it. Here are a 
few things to think about:
	✓	In Rico v. Mitsubishi Motor Corp., the trial 
court judge disqualified the attorney from 
the case for using privileged documents to 
try to discredit the opposing party’s expert 
witness. The California Supreme Court 
upheld the decision.
	✓	In Mira Inc. v. O’Brien, a Massachusetts 
court allowed a privileged communication 
to be used to impeach a witness whose tes­
timony was not consistent with the letter. 
	✓	The New York County Lawyers Association 
has a formal opinion (No. 730) that a lawyer 
refrain from reviewing inadvertently dis­
closed information that is subject to privi­
lege or protection.
	✓	There is an ethical controversy on the 
ability of counsel to mine another party’s 
documents for hidden information. This is 
especially sensitive if there is metadata or 
if the form requested allows for mining of 
information. A lawyer must be aware of the 
potential while negotiating a discovery plan 
and the form of production.
	✓	The American Bar Association’s stand­
ing committee on ethics in Formal Opinion 
06-442 stated that reviewing and using 
embedded data in ESI is not unethical for 
an attorney. It also found a duty on the 
disclosing attorney to avoid inadvertent 
disclosure. For example, scrubbing the 
metadata, or at a minimum, entering into 
a clawback agreement as discussed in 
Chapter 10. This position has not been uni­
formly adopted by all the states.
	✓	In New York, the ethics committee in 
Opinion 749 held that attorneys should not 
use available technology to examine and 
trace e-mail and other electronic docu­
ments. To do so is a violation of the New 
York rules of conduct.
	✓	Other states vary in what can be done. 
Colorado provides that an attorney may 
mine the data unless the attorney has 
been notified that it was inadvertently sent. 
Maryland allows its use. Pennsylvania 
takes an intermediate approach by put­
ting the decision on the attorney judgment 
in light of all the facts. There is some con­
sistency in providing that there is an ethi­
cal obligation on the sending attorney to 
assure that privilege or protected ESI is not 
disclosed, including metadata.
	
✓	For spoliation, the court in United States v. Philip Morris precluded the 
use of any defense witness who failed to follow the preservation order, 
awarded $2.75 million in monetary sanctions ($250,000 for each cor­
porate manager who failed to comply with the order), and payment of 
plaintiffs costs incurred in the spoliation. 
	
✓	In Ajaxo, Inc., et al. v. Bank of America Technology and Operations, Inc., 
et al., the court sanctioned the plaintiffs and their counsel for failure to 
obey a court order and produce the ESI in a searchable format.

Policing e-Discovery in Criminal Cases
The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCrimP), as discussed in Chapter 
4, establish certain discovery requirements. These are both on the prosecu­
tors and defendants. In the high profile case of Senator Stevens, the United 
States Attorney General moved to dismiss the case against Senator Stevens. 
One of the main reasons was the failure of the government to turn over the 
defense’s potentially exculpatory evidence. It also resulted in the judge issu­
ing a contempt citation against a number of government lawyers.
Destroying evidence, including ESI, in a criminal matter can be considered 
an obstruction of justice under 18 USC 1503. This is a criminal offense for 
anyone involved and has been extended to include concealing, attempting to 
conceal, altering, or distorting a document. This applies to judicial proceed­
ings once it is known that a proceeding has commenced.

97
 Chapter 5: Judging Professional Competence and Conduct 
For hearings before Congress or an agency of the government, the same 
rules apply under Section 1505. This applies when notice of an investigation 
is about to begin. The determination of when notice is made and the duty to 
preserve begins is a question of fact for the court to determine on a case-by-
case basis.
There is a broader provision in Section 1510 that makes it illegal to obstruct 
the giving of information on a crime to federal investigators even without an 
actual case or agency action.
In addition to these specific crimes, there are general crimes that may be 
charged, such as conspiracy or concealment of a crime. Also you can be 
charged with criminal contempt of court for failing to obey a court order or 
subpoena.

Par t III
Identif ying, 
Preser ving, and 
Collecting ESI

In this part . . .
I
n this part, we cover the steps to take when a lawsuit 
has been served. You learn what to do when you’re 
facing an e-discovery request, marking that day as day-
zero (t0) on the countdown to the meet and confer with 
opposing counsel within 99 days (t99). 
You need to mobilize a team that keeps the e-discovery 
processes flowing smoothly, but simply flowing may be 
the best you can get, as you read in Chapter 6. Your objec­
tive is to identify what ESI is potentially relevant and 
accessible, figure out which data custodians are within 
the scope of the request, and use legally-defensible means 
to limit the burden of e-discovery. And you thought that 
identifying ESI was going to be tough!
Preserving ESI, like catching lightning, has challenges that 
you learn in Chapter 7. You learn why simply telling users 
“don’t touch” will motivate them to delete their e-mails 
(within scope) at warp speed. You start to understand 
how to play the high-stakes game of ESI-Hold’em.
In Chapter 8, you see real action with the opposition in 
the meet-and-confer session. Your take-away from this 
negotiation in an e-discovery plan must be presented to 
the court 21 days later. As you read, you have to comply 
with this plan so arriving armed with ESI-intel makes you 
dangerous to your opponent. Total elapsed time is 120 
days after the lawsuit is served. If you mess up the negoti­
ation, don’t expect to re-negotiate or get any other type of 
bailout.
“The skillful strategist defeats the enemy without doing 
battle.”

Chapter 6
Identifying Potentially 
Relevant ESI
In This Chapter
▶	Rallying the task force
▶	Assessing the scope
▶	Taking costs down a notch
▶	Preparing an ESI data map
▶	Understanding that more people don’t always make the task easier
T
he legal system is built on the parties — and not the courts — developing 
the evidence for the case. During the first e-discovery stage, identifica­
tion, that’s exactly what you’re doing. Many critical and combative activities 
go on during identification, such as identifying the type and location of all the 
ESI that you may need to preserve or negotiating the scope of e-discovery 
with your opponent.
If you’ve received an e-discovery request or anticipate one, your top priority 
is to identify potentially relevant ESI. You begin by figuring out the appro­
priate search criteria, such as the names of people who might have the ESI, 
the devices where the ESI is stored, the date ranges when it was created, 
the key words that it contains, and other protocols that are specified in the 
e-discovery request. Armed with the search criteria, you find the right digital 
haystacks to search and then search them to find the location of the data, 
files, and attachments. 
In this chapter, you find out more about identifying ESI of potential relevance 
to the legal action according to a formal response plan. You read how to 
negotiate the scope of e-discovery to arrive at an agreement with the oppos­
ing side. These agreements, done right, greatly reduce the risk of evidence 
spoliation motions. Expect the opposing side to take heavy swings at your 
search protocols and results. Litigation is full of fiery disputes over whether 
your efforts to identify responsive documents (no matter how incriminating) 
were made in good faith. Your defense, as always, is the detailed documenta­
tion showing your reliable and reasonable data mining efforts. Regardless of 

102
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
the disruption to your work and the routine operations of the IT department, 
you do perform your e-discovery duties thoroughly and in good faith.
Calling an e-Discovery Team into Action
This is not a computer simulation. You’re now in an active legal action and 
need to learn what ESI to preserve and the locations where they’re stored. In 
this chapter, we focus on assembling a team to identify what needs to be pre­
served and what doesn’t. We cover how to preserve the ESI in Chapter 7.
Identification is a team effort. The first step is to assemble an e-discovery 
team (or task force, if you prefer) of capable and reliable people. Following a 
project management approach, as you read in Chapter 3, helps ensure that 
deadlines are met and resources are not overallocated. 
	
A dead giveaway that you’ve overallocated resources is that someone needs 
to be in two or more places at the same time or work 60 hours per week for 
several months.
Team size varies because you need enough members to cover the workload 
and areas of expertise. As you’d expect, team size depends on the type and 
magnitude of the case. Too many people on a team lead to team members 
deflecting their responsibility to others or assuming that someone else was 
taking care of it. You can read about other problems caused by overstuffed 
teams in the section “Taking Lessons from the Mythical Member” later in 
this chapter. When there are too few people, deadlines get missed and stress 
builds.
A cross-functional e-discovery team has the following representatives and 
skills:
	
✓	General counsel (GC): General counsels are your company’s legal advi­
sors who are under the gun to identify ESI and storage locations with the 
help of IT. They are held accountable for monitoring the litigation hold 
(see Chapter 7) and ensuring compliance with it. They’re also referred 
to as in-house counsel or corporate counsel.
	
✓	External counsel: These are the litigators. They’re the lawyers who spe­
cialize in lawsuits and the court system. Also called trial lawyers, they’re 
retained by your company. They have the most extensive knowledge of 
the rules of procedure, rules of evidence, and recent case law. External 
counsel also have their own staff of paralegals and litigation supporters 
who you may be working with closely throughout e-discovery.
	
✓	IT personnel: There’s a wide range of IT personnel whose expertise you 
need, including the chief information officer (CIO), database administra­
tor, and network administrator. If someone manages the e-mail server 
and accounts, that person may play a starring role.

103
 Chapter 6: Identifying Potentially Relevant ESI
	
✓	Records managers or data librarians: Your company may not be large 
enough to have someone dedicated to this job function, but if it is, you 
need their expertise. Even if no one has this job title, someone must per­
form these roles.
	
✓	Human resources (HR) personnel: HR serves a legal function, and for 
employment lawsuits or issues involving departing employees, it’s 
needed.
	
✓	Accounting personnel: If the case involves a spectacular accounting 
breakthrough or financial meltdown, such as those of Madoff, Enron, or 
Lehman Brothers, or if it impacts the bottom line, you need an accoun­
tant. Select an accountant who is familiar with the IRS, Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, and disclosure requirements 
of other regulatory agencies.
	
✓	Information security (infosec) or disaster recovery personnel: Infosec 
staff know your company’s IT infrastructure and data archiving policy 
and programs, both the formal (written) ones and the informal ones. 
While you’re preserving ESI and protecting it from contamination by 
malware, IT operations may get disrupted, which requires their support. 
For cases involving intrusions into users’ accounts, their expertise is 
crucial.
	
	People in the company may have a burning desire to access files and 
e-mails to delete incriminating content. Infosec personnel guard against 
such electronic whiteout. 
	
✓	An e-discovery expert or vendor: You may need expertise that you 
can’t find in your company. Partnering with a vendor can help you 
with forensically preserving ESI (if needed), ensuring chain of custody, 
searching and deduping (removing duplicates) ESI, meeting review and 
production deadlines, or any of the many steps in e-discovery. Preparing 
in advance of litigation by selecting a set of preferred vendors or part­
nering with vendors reduces time, stress, and risks. 
The e-discovery team needs to know about your data retention and business 
processes. Schedule an initial meeting during which you can make sure roles, 
responsibilities, timelines, and what’s at stake are clear. IT leads the techni­
cal requirements while lawyers make sure that the rules are followed and 
deadlines are met. Your team leader will most likely be a legal person.
	
Create a list of the names of team members, their job titles, and contact infor­
mation. You want job titles because e-discovery can last for a year or longer, 
and people may change jobs within the company or leave it. As you lose mem­
bers, you replace them with new people with similar job titles. 

104
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
Clarifying the Scope of e-Discovery
You’ll probably have some trouble nailing down the scope of e-discovery 
for your case. Even when you think you’ve captured all ESI in the scope, the 
other side may file a motion that makes you go dig through ESI again. Or 
someone finds a stash of DVDs, flash drives, or tapes with responsive ESI. Or 
the judge may issue decisions that change the scope — by ruling on the date 
ranges, data custodians, or search terms. Accept surprises and disruptions 
as part of your job or you’ll be driven crazy putting out fires.
Scope of e-discovery has three dimensions. Defining the three dimensions is 
not a linear process, but a process of many revisions. Think of all ESI as fit­
ting into a cube (see Figure 6-1), and you need to identify only those chunks 
that fall within the scope. The scope of relevant ESI, which custodians are 
within the scope, and the data ranges all can change throughout the case up 
to and including the trial. There are consequences for not being prepared, 
such as sanctions or not being able to use ESI to prove your case, because 
companies are obligated to be prepared.
	
An unexpected dramatic expansion of the scope of e-discovery is not unusual. 
Have contingency plans to be able to scale up. One method is to partner with 
a vendor who can bring in the needed resources on short notice.

Data ranges
Data custodians
and key players
During the identification process, you generally assess these three scopes:
	
✓	Data custodians and key players: Interview individual holders, or cus­
todians. Data custodians are those who know how ESI is kept, where it’s 
kept, and how accessible it is. Key players are those who are somehow 
associated with the elements or ESI of the case. Business clients, cus­
tomers, and others outside your company may be key players. Those 
who might be witnesses should be interviewed in person or via some 

105
 Chapter 6: Identifying Potentially Relevant ESI
other live method, such as video conference or phone call. Interviews 
can also be done using surveys or forms via the Internet or paper.
	
✓	Responsive ESI and locations: This is the content that’s reasonably or 
potentially relevant to the case and may include texts, address books, 
and calendars from handheld devices. You need to identify the loca­
tion of potentially responsive ESI, its availability or accessibility, and its 
format.
	
✓	Date ranges or time frames: These are the start dates and end dates 
that define the time range of interest in the investigation.
You’re identifying not only what’s within scope, but also the limiting factors 
that exclude them from the scope. Limiting the scope is covered in the sec­
tion “Reducing Burden with the Proportionality Principle” in this chapter.
Follow these steps to perform all your duties related to the three scopes:
	
1.	Make an initial or early case assessment of the data custodians and 
holders of hot docs and other responsive ESI.
	
	 Based on the elements of the case, you have a general idea of who might 
have control or custody of the ESI most likely to be responsive. You may 
be identifying key people by job function, project worked on, depart­
ment, office, geographical location, or some other combination of cri­
teria. Or you may have enough information to identify people by name. 
Early case assessments often change because the party filing the lawsuit 
may re-file it with additional demands or one or more charges may get 
dropped from the suit.
	
	 Ask your attorney whether the lawsuit includes names. Then there’s no 
mystery about who the key players are, at least at the outset.
	
	 Often a few data custodians have the bulk of responsive ESI even when 
there are more than 100 custodians. As a general guideline, 5 to 10 data 
custodians have as much as 80 percent of the documents. If there are 
many data custodians, group them into two buckets:
 
• Major data custodians: Those who have a high percentage of the 
responsive ESI.
 
• Minor data custodians: Those who may have a small percentage of 
responsive ESI.
	
2.	 Make a broad initial assessment of which ESI is responsive and where 
it’s located.
	
	 Consider all types of ESI that pertain to the case, which could be perfor­
mance and financial records, contracts and drafts of contracts, purchase 
orders, text messages, and e-mail. Think in terms of buckets into which 
you put content to sort out more completely later. Useful ESI buckets are

106
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
 
• Definitely falls within the scope: ESI that’s within the time range 
and obviously related to the elements of the case goes into this 
bucket. For example, in employment cases, you have a good idea 
of whose e-mail messages are within scope. For fraud cases, you 
know that financial statements, reconciliations, and adjusting 
entries will be key evidence. Dealing with dates can get complex if 
you’ve upgraded your company’s information technology applica­
tions and database (for example, by migrating from legacy systems 
to SAP or Oracle enterprise systems). Verify that the dates are 
accurate so that you don’t collect, review, and produce ESI that 
you didn’t need to be produced — and that you produce what’s 
relevant. 
	
	If the modified, accessed, and created/change of status (MAC) 
times of files must be verified, then you need the help of a com­
puter forensics expert. MAC times can be hours off, and MAC dates 
can be off by several years. This creates a loophole that the oppos­
ing side may use to challenge the admissibility of your ESI, or the 
judge may refuse to allow it into evidence.
 
• Might fall within the scope: This is like a temporary folder for ESI. 
Put ESI into this bucket if there’s a chance (that is, it is within the 
time range or is from a person of interest) you might need to pro­
duce it. If you don’t know for sure, err on the side of caution. The 
scope of the case itself may expand or contract, and the ESI in this 
bucket can move to one of the other two buckets.
 
• Outside the scope: What gets tossed into this bucket, either delib­
erately or by default (if it no longer falls into the scope of the other 
buckets), is ESI that you may later have to defend as not being rea­
sonably anticipated to be relevant. This ESI would not be subject 
to a legal hold, as you find out more about in Chapter 7.
	
	 Be realistic or pessimistic in your early case assessment. Keep in mind 
that you’re brainstorming, and attempts at precision may increase time 
and costs, but not much else. As the case progresses and the fog of 
uncertainty lifts, you can update these buckets. Some cases come down 
to only a few documents or messages. Most likely, you’re not going to 
find only those few hot docs (these are like smoking guns) at this time. 
Other cases involve loads of documents. Your determinations help pre­
pare for the meet-and-confer session. After the meet-and-confer session, 
you can refine your buckets.
	
3.	Verify or correlate the time frames to events. 
	
	 The specific start or end dates may not be specified. Instead, the dates 
may be references to events. Even if dates are listed, you want to verify 
their validity. It’s quite possible that people will make mistakes or typos, 
and they could stretch the truth.

 Chapter 6: Identifying Potentially Relevant ESI
	
Be sure everyone on the team knows when the final product is due, as well as 
the interim deadlines along the way. 
Reducing the Burden with the 
Proportionality Principle
External counsel uses information from your e-discovery team to determine — 
and then negotiate or argue — the cost or burden of producing certain ESI 
versus the benefits. Proportionality is a negotiating weapon that you can use 
only if you can actually show or explain the proportions. 
If you understand what ESI is not reasonably accessible but potentially rel­
evant early in the litigation, even before e-discovery is conducted, you can 
give your lawyer the necessary info to limit the scope of discovery during the 
meet-and-confer session. He can negotiate any information that is reasonably 
accessible to you, including the burden or cost of retrieving and reviewing 
the information.
Proportionality of scale
Proportionality of scale, according to Rule 26(b)(2)(C), is meant to balance 
the value of the case with the cost of producing different kinds of ESI. The 
rule states in part:
“A party need not provide discovery of electronically stored informa­
tion from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible 
because of undue burden or cost.”
Proportionality is ultimately determined by the disputed issues, the law 
(the rules), and the courts (judges). Beginning with the scheduling meeting, 
judges are involved in the case. Judges resolve conflicts, balance competing 
interests, and settle any motions to compel production or attempts to resist 
production. A motion to compel production is a request to the court to force 
the opponent to produce ESI. To counter the motion, the opposing party may 
attempt to convince the judge not to grant the motion.
	
The scope of ESI is broad and not limited to what may be used at trial. Federal 
courts and many state courts allow you to discover any ESI relevant to the 
claim. Whether it’s admissible is another issue for the lawyers to fight over.

108
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
Negotiating with proportionality
After you identify the sources of ESI that are potentially responsive but not 
reasonably accessible, use that intelligence to negotiate a better position: 
One that’s lower risk, lower cost, or lower burden. Here are some of them:
	
✓	You can ask for a temporary reprieve or pardon from having to produce 
the tough stuff.
	
✓	You can ask for a reprieve from any sanctions for not producing it until 
the court demands that you turn it over.
	
✓	Ask your opponent to show good cause for you producing the ESI. At a 
minimum, this buys you some time. If the opposing side can’t show good 
cause or you can defeat their attempt, you’re spared. Be careful of this 
trap if you’re the requesting party. 
	
✓	You can ask the court to shift the cost of producing the not reasonably 
accessible ESI to the requesting party — away from you.
By classifying ESI as accessible or not reasonably accessible, you’re in posi­
tion to ask to have that ESI excluded under Rule 26(b) or shift some of the 
costs under Rule 26(c).
Mapping the Information Architecture
The FRCP requires that you know your IT architecture and that you can 
describe it at a granular level — a level that’s detailed enough to identify the 
scope of e-discovery. You’ll most likely convey this information with a data 
map. Data maps make it easier to implement litigation holds as well as the col­
lection, review and production of ESI and the identification of key witnesses. 
Developing a data map is your first step in understanding the flow of ESI, which 
is critical to in-house counsel in litigation. The detailed information in a data 
map can include facts that outside counsel can use to convince opposition or 
the court that certain forms of ESI are too tough or costly to access.
	
The data map is designed to provide the information needed to create the pro­
posed e-discovery plan for the meet-and-confer session. 
Creating a data map
Preparing a data map is smart preparation. A data map is like a catalog that 
lists your company’s records and describes them by business unit, if appropri­
ate, and the types of storage media on which they’re maintained. Each busi­
ness unit in your company identifies its own retention policies and explains the 
reasons for any differences from the company’s written policies that may exist. 

109
 Chapter 6: Identifying Potentially Relevant ESI
The completed data map gives you a full picture of the nature, type, and loca­
tion of all records and retention policies within your company. The map serves 
as the base for educating outside counsel your e-discovery team.
A data map shows ESI at a granular level by identifying the following infor­
mation for each ESI type or electronic record (e-record) in use. You and the 
team build the data map by function, department, or division, while you 
research and answer these questions:
	
✓	Who are the data custodians? Identify and interview custodians to learn 
about their responsibilities and practices. Find out who’s responsible for 
maintaining each department or division’s business records. Verify the 
extent to which they actually comply with the electronic records reten­
tion procedures. Don’t ignore anyone’s deviations in practice from exist­
ing records retention policies. Write them all down. These custodians 
may be called upon to elaborate on each e-record type and retention. 
Be aware that data custodians may be called to testify in depositions or 
court. 
	
✓	Where are your computers, laptops, handheld devices, and data serv­
ers, and who uses them? Identify your computer equipment and key 
users. Users may become witnesses, too. Data maps list the data stores, 
including file and e-mail servers, desktop and notebook computers, por­
table drives and optical media, and handhelds.
	
✓	What format is the ESI in? The default format is native format, the 
format in which the ESI was originally created. But check with your 
lawyer about whether the requesting party has specified a format.
	
✓	What are the data retention schedules and policies, disposal policies, 
backup policies, and archiving rules? Identify onsite and offsite data 
storage locations, portable storage media, and possibly the personal 
storage locations of key players. The FRCP has specific requirements for 
the storage and production of different types of metadata. You may be 
required to produce ESI in their native formats.
	
	Explain how these policies are monitored or enforced (or how you 
believe they’re enforced). Routine destruction of old ESI may be accept­
able, as long as a consistent and good faith policy is in place. To sup­
port your defense about data that’s not readily accessible, this analysis 
should also document the costs associated with accessing ESI from 
backups, restoring ESI from backups, and any hardware or software 
needed to access and restore the ESI.
	
	If ESI has been deleted, particularly from laptops and computers, you 
can likely recover it using computer forensics tools. Don’t make the 
mistake of claiming that the e-mail messages are gone when they’re in 
covert condition.
Figure 6-2 shows an example of a data map.

 Chapter 6: Identifying Potentially Relevant ESI
	
The information that you need to collect is spread out. Some of it’s written, 
and some of it has to be learned though interviews. Have meetings to discuss 
what questions to ask and how to get truthful answers to your questions.
You can record the information in a spreadsheet or other document, but for 
extensive infrastructure and data mapping, you’ll want to use a software solu­
tion or an automated solution specifically for e-discovery. By keeping your 
data map updated as changes occur, you keep it in ready-to-use condition. 
This reduces the risk of not having enough time to adequately prepare for 
the meet-and-confer session.
Most e-discovery vendors offer data mapping services. There are also ESI 
data map software vendors/consultants, such as
	
✓	The Ingersoll Form: www.theingersollfirm.com
	
✓	Fios: www.fiosinc.com/
	
✓	Exterro: www.exterro.com 
Lawyers can request ESI from the laptops of specific employees, retired 
applications that you cannot access, home computers used for work-related 
purposes, and the content of flash drives and backup tapes. You always 
want the ESI map to identify data that’s no longer accessible due to technical 
limitations, expired licenses, discontinued proprietary applications, and ESI 
retention policies.
	
Including an estimate of the cost to recover certain not reasonably accessible 
data gives the judge a way to weigh the impact of e-discovery against the 
potential usefulness of the ESI requested.
Overlooking ESI
You’ll most likely overlook sources of ESI. Mobile workers’ laptops, out-of-use 
applications or zip drives, or undisclosed backups created by project man­
agers with a deep mistrust of hard drive reliability are all possibilities. Your 
opponent can request any or all of these data stores. To make yourself look 
good in front of the judge, as soon as you realize that ESI was overlooked, get 
in front of this train by disclosing the overlooked ESI. Depending upon when 
you think to look for ESI in these different places, you may be facing penal­
ties. If overlooking ESI leads to late production, hopefully your lawyer can get 
your company out of serious trouble or monetary sanctions.

In Phoenix Four, Inc. v. Strategic Resources Corporation (2006), the court found 
that late production of ESI amounted to gross negligence. The defendant did 
not search its servers completely and was unaware of 25GB of data, which 
is roughly equivalent to 2,500 boxes of paper. The ESI was located on an 
unmapped hard drive partition such that

112
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
“. . . someone using a computer connected to that server could not ‘view’ 
or gain access to that section of the hard drive and would have no way of 
knowing of its existence.”
By locating the ESI late in the discovery process and producing it after the 
deadline, the court awarded monetary sanctions against certain defendants 
and their counsel for destruction and late production of evidence. 
Describing data retention 
policies and procedures
You want legally defensible data retention and disposal procedures. 
Determining whether ESI has been disposed of in good faith or whether it was 
disposed in order to obstruct justice is a serious matter. You don’t want the 
court to think you’ve disposed of the ESI for the latter reason.
With business records, you don’t have much discretion. Local, state, federal, 
and international laws and an increasing number of industry regulations dic­
tate the types of data you must retain, how long you must maintain specific 
types of data, and even the manner in which you store the data. 
Retention is less tight with ESI like e-mail, documents, spreadsheets, and so 
on that is created or received by employees. Retention policies that rely on 
individual employees to correctly save and store — or get rid of promptly — 
are also less secure. 
Here’s an example of what might happen in a workplace harassment lawsuit 
in which the harassing conduct is objectionable e-mail sent over the past 12 
months. As soon as the defendants find out that they’ve been named in the 
lawsuit, they start deleting everything — a massive information wipeout. In 
fact, their efforts are not only useless because the messages have already 
been backed up, but also because logs show the attempted cover up. This 
example shows that you may not have data retention policies and strong 
enough enforcement procedures in place. 
During the identification stage of e-discovery, you need to describe the fol­
lowing to the court:
	
✓	Your written data retention policies
	
✓	Your methods for communicating policies to all users of company com­
puters, networks, and digital devices — and reminders of the policies 
sent to users
	
✓	User training and documentation of that training

113
 Chapter 6: Identifying Potentially Relevant ESI
	
✓	Consent forms signed by users wherein they acknowledge understand­
ing of the policy rules, agree to abide by them, and know the conse­
quences for noncompliance
	
✓	Your methods for monitoring and enforcing compliance
Proving the reasonable accessibility 
of ESI sources
Rule 26(b)(2)(B) created and introduced the awkwardly worded concept of 
not reasonably accessible ESI. The terms reasonably accessible or not reason­
ably accessible in negotiations or court filings do not flow smoothly. Some 
people use accessible and inaccessible ESI. Not so fast. There’s a reason why 
defendants on trial are found to be guilty or not guilty. Not guilty is not the 
same as innocent. And not guilty is a more correct and precise term.
Law is precise in this area. Using accessible and inaccessible misstates the 
Rule 26 standard, which is not to your advantage. Only ESI that exists on 
known storage media — all of which have been physically destroyed — can 
be defined with confidence as inaccessible.
While you’re identifying ESI, make sure to describe the following:
	
✓	What ESI is reasonably accessible, what is not reasonably accessible, 
and why or why not
	
✓	The cost to produce various types or scopes of ESI regardless of 
accessibility
	
✓	Whether accessing and presenting legacy data will require legacy appli­
cations or consultants
The ability to argue that ESI is not reasonably inaccessible is related to costs 
and burden, so do your calculations. 
Taking Lessons from the 
Mythical Member
In 1975, Fred Brooks Jr. published The Mythical Man-Month (Pearson) in 
which he describes differences between large and small projects. While 
Fred focused on software development projects, his principles are dead on 
for most schedule-driven team efforts, like identification. The book’s cover 
depicts beasts struggling to pull their stuck limbs out of a tar pit, a metaphor 
for the Catch-22 of completing software projects on schedule and to specifi­
cations. Sound familiar? 

114
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
One of his ideas, known as Brooks’s Law, is that “adding manpower to a late 
software project makes it later.” He explains that software development isn’t 
like harvesting crops, which can be done faster with more workers. When 
new members are added to a software development team, those on the team 
need to drop what they’re doing and bring new members up to speed. As the 
team size grows, so does the amount of time needed to coordinate work.
Electronic discovery has the same characteristics and symptoms described 
by Brooks. Every time you go through the process is like the first time 
because of the unique features of the legal case and people involved. The 
following are two other tar traps to be aware of during your identification 
processes:
	
✓	Slipping behind slowly: Identification needs to be completed in time for 
your lawyers to prepare for the meet-and-confer session. Falling behind 
may be barely noticeable because it happens one day at a time. Most 
slippage is caused by termites, not tornadoes.
	
✓	Bending timelines: You can’t reduce the amount of time for some 
processes if one task needs to be finished before the next task can begin. 
As Brooks writes, “The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter 
how many women are assigned.” You may need creative ways to bend 
timelines and unblock bottlenecks. 
Doing identification correctly saves you from having to do a lot explaining 
when disputes arise — and they will.

Chapter 7
Complying with ESI Preservation 
and a Litigation Hold
In This Chapter
▶	Drawing a bright line between duty to preserve and preservation
▶	Being guided by The Sedona Conference WG1
▶	Knowing what and when to hold
▶	Stopping ESI deep-sixing
▶	Stopping in the name of litigation
W
hen you zero in on the locations that store responsive ESI, you pre­
serve them and prepare to demonstrate good faith in your ESI pres­
ervation efforts. During litigation, you face heated disputes over your efforts 
to find responsive ESI and to destroy incriminating documents. If you can’t 
prove that you’re not guilty of willful mismanagement (legalese for disappear­
ance) or negligent management (oops, we lost it) of digital devices or discov­
erable ESI, you’re also facing punishment from the court. Failing to preserve 
a litigation hold brings sanctions, such as adverse inference jury instructions 
(juries can infer the evidence would’ve been incriminating), fines reaching 
into millions of dollars, and expenses for an expert to investigate suspected 
destruction of incriminating e-evidence. In the worst case, you lose.
In this chapter, you read about the preservation of reasonably accessible 
ESI, how to deal with not reasonably accessible ESI, and how to physically 
host and manage a litigation hold on your ESI. Litigation holds are affirma­
tive acts to prevent the destruction of paper or digital documents. You read 
that courts may issue sanctions even when the destruction appears to be 
inadvertent. You get into the crevices of preservation duties; for example, a 
human resources department that processes terminations or exit interviews 
becomes the custodian of data received from departing employees, which 
may be subject to litigation hold. It’s a safe bet that employees recently pink-
slipped don’t care about preserving ESI litigation hold. You need to be.

116
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
Distinguishing Duty to Preserve 
from Preservation
The e-discovery rules regarding the preservation process, as with other 
e-discovery processes, are grounded in two ideals:
	
✓	Good faith: Acting in good faith in this instance means making informed 
decisions about preserving ESI untainted by self-interest. Of course, 
using mistakes made by your opponent against them (and in your self-
interest) is alright.
	
✓	Reasonableness: This vague standard requires taking affirmative action 
to preserve potentially relevant ESI. Preservation obligations supersede 
your company’s electronic record retention and management policies 
that could destroy ESI.
No bright lines draw clear boundaries between good and bad faith, what is 
and is not reasonable, and what you need to preserve and what you don’t 
have to preserve. To sort out the murkiness, you first need to recognize the 
difference between the duty to preserve and preservation:
	
✓	Duty to preserve: The duty to preserve potential sources of discover­
able ESI is a pre-discovery obligation.
	
	The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) does not apply to pre-
discovery or prelitigation. Case law is the governing law. Meeting your 
duty to preserve, in effect, requires that you have a well-thought-out 
information management (or electronic records management) program 
in effect. (Electronic records management is discussed in Chapter 14.) 
How well you meet this duty influences your ability to preserve when 
litigation — and therefore, the FRCP — triggers the need to do so.
	
	Periodically revising your preservation plan could mean the difference 
between winning your case and being sanctioned by the court.
	
✓	Preservation: The preservation phase loosely begins after the identifica­
tion phase (see Chapter 6).
	
	Preservation means protecting ESI that you might need to produce from 
being cleaned up accidentally or on purpose. Figuring out what you’ll be 
expected to produce so that you know what to preserve is tricky.
Following The Sedona Conference
When you know that litigation has begun or will begin, you take reasonable 
steps to hold on to relevant ESI for e-discovery, even if you’re a third-party to 
the suit. Did we mention that preservation is tricky? Some comfort became 

117
 Chapter 7: Complying with ESI Preservation and a Litigation Hold
available in mid-2008 when the first Working Group (WG1) of The Sedona 
Conference published guidelines and a decision tree. WG1 is the Working 
Group on Electronic Document Retention and Production.
WG1’s 2008 guidelines provide important advice.
	
✓	For satisfying your duty to make decisions in good faith about the 
accessibility of ESI.
	
✓	To know what guidelines the court will use to judge whether your 
decisions.
The word reasonable is critical to distinguishing good from bad, and now 
the courts and litigants have a respected set of guidelines to evaluate what’s 
reasonable. 
The Sedona Conference WG1 guidelines
The Sedona Conference WG1 published six guidelines in July 2008. 
	
✓	Guideline 1: When you anticipate litigation but no plaintiff has emerged 
or it’s not yet possible to discuss litigation, you should make preserva­
tion decisions that follow the processes in the decision tree.
	
	Figure 7-1 shows the decision tree as a flowchart showing the processes 
(in rounded squares) and decision points (in diamond shape) that lead 
to two alternatives based on the conditions tested:
 
• Preservation is required. You must preserve the ESI, which could be 
a hard drive or flash drive for example.
 
• Preservation is not required. You don’t have to preserve the ESI.
	
✓	Guideline 2: As soon as feasible, discuss all preservation issues in suf­
ficient detail with other parties, so you can reach a mutually satisfactory 
accommodation and evaluate whether you need to seek court interven­
tion or assistance. (You should undertake the latter only if you can’t come 
to an agreement about how to preserve ESI with your opposing party.)
	
✓	Guideline 3: You should clearly identify the inaccessible sources rea­
sonably related to the discovery or claims you don’t plan on searching 
or preserving.
	
✓	Guideline 4: You need to be very careful when for business reasons you 
move potentially discoverable information that’s subject to a preserva­
tion duty from accessible to less-accessible data stores.
	
✓	Guideline 5: In the absence of an applicable preservation duty, you can 
manage your information in a way that minimizes accumulations of inac­
cessible data, provided that you make adequate provisions to comply 
with preservation duties.

✓	Guideline 6: You should encourage cooperation among legal and other

preservation duties are met and that resources are effectively utilized.
Seeing the rules in the WG1 decision tree 
The WG1’s decision tree concisely represents these two subsections of Rule 
26(b)(2):
	
✓	The two-tier test of Rule 26(b)(2)(B): You can object to producing ESI 
from sources that you identify as not reasonably accessible because of 
undue burden or cost.
	
✓	The proportionality test of Rule 26(b)(2)(C): The court may still order 
discovery of your not reasonably accessible ESI if the requesting party 
shows that the benefits outweigh the burden and cost.
	
You cannot ignore data storage media that fall into the preservation is not 
required tier. Under Rule 26(b)(2)(B), you must disclose the existence of ESI 
located on sources that are not reasonably accessible even if you have not 
searched them. Put another way, you must identify those sources that you 
don’t intend to search or from which discovery won’t be made.

Commentary on Preservation, Management and Identification of Sources of 
Information that are Not Reasonably Accessible developed by WG1 from www.
thesedonaconference.org/dltForm?did=NRA.pdf.
Recognizing a Litigation Hold 
Order and Obligation
A litigation hold is a preservation hold. It’s an affirmative action by your com­
pany to prevent the destruction of physical or digital documents relevant to 
a lawsuit or government investigation. The purpose of the litigation hold is 
to stop routine or any other destruction of potentially responsive ESI and to 
make sure that ESI stays safe until the hold is released. Failed litigation holds 
have gotten some of the biggest headlines in e-discovery because a failed 
litigation hold is the most likely path to spoliation (destruction or extreme 
alteration of evidence).
	
When your action or inaction causes harm to your opponent’s case, the court 
may impose a termination sanction. In other words, you lose on the spot.
You’re free to preserve documents any way you see fit, as long as the methods 
and media are reasonable. If you preserve ESI by saving them to hard-to-access 

120
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
backup tapes, or without an index to facilitate search, you cannot later tell 
the court the ESI is not reasonably accessible — you should have kept it 
accessible.
Of the many questions surrounding the issue of a litigation hold, here are 
four of them:
	
✓	What triggers a litigation hold?
	
✓	When must a litigation hold start or be applied?
	
✓	Does starting a litigation hold late mean an automatic sanction?
	
✓	Does a litigation hold apply to ESI that’s lost because employees left 
their positions or the company?
Figure 7-2 shows a master plan of the litigation hold process beginning with 
a triggering event and ending with the release of the litigation hold. You read 
about the process in the following sections.
Knowing what triggers a litigation hold
The first thing you have to do is recognize an event that can trigger the need 
for you to implement a litigation hold. Here are several events that rise to the 
level of a triggering event, of which the first two are easily identifiable trigger­
ing events:
	
✓	A preservation letter from opposing counsel or a government agency 
stating in effect, “We’re going to sue you.”
	
✓	A complaint is filed with, “We’re suing you” language.
	
✓	A threat of litigation or an investigation, such as when companies in 
your industry are being sued or investigated.
	
✓	Knowing that there’s a problem that could turn into a lawsuit. 
	
If you suspect that there’s a triggering event, ask your in-house counsel for 
an opinion. Get the opinion in writing, and keep it in case you have to defend 
your inaction or delayed action.
Knowing when to issue a litigation hold
Knowing when to issue a litigation hold is not simple. The latest date that you 
can justify issuing a hold is the date you receive the preservation letter or 
the date the complaint is filed. If there’s no letter or complaint, start the hold 
when you anticipate litigation. Zubulake established that the duty to preserve 
attaches at the time litigation is reasonably anticipated.

121
 Chapter 7: Complying with ESI Preservation and a Litigation Hold
	
Figure 7-2: 
Major steps 
and consid-
erations in 
the litigation 
hold 
process.
	
Take afﬁrmative steps to preserve
potentially relevant ESI of all
employees or witnesses, including
departing ones.
Take afﬁrmative steps to suspend
routine ESI processing systems and
retention/recycling programs that would
destroy or alter potentially relevant ESI.
Enforce and examine compliance with the legal hold.
Release the legal hold when it’s no longer required.
Modify the legal hold, as necessary. Periodically reissue the hold to
remind employees and witnesses and to make new employees aware.
Triggering event is identiﬁed or
veriﬁed by counsel.
If the legal opinion is that no triggering event
exists, retain counsel’s letter as documentation
that there was no reasonable expectation of
litigation at that time.
If there’s no preservation letter or complaint,
issue a legal hold when litigation may be
reasonably anticipated.
Issue a legal hold as of the date
the preservation letter is
received or the complaint is ﬁled.
Because questions about a litigation hold are based on the facts of the situa­
tion, you need to be able to document what you did and why you did it, and 
to argue convincingly and intelligently that what you did was reasonable. If 
you document that, at the time, you did not recognize the trigger event as a 
red flag of foreseeable litigation, you have a chance at avoiding sanctions.
Any relevant evidence that’s destroyed before the trigger date would 
be harmless because you were unaware of a need to preserve evidence. 
Destroying potential evidence after the trigger date is never allowed. 
	
Your litigation hold decisions are analyzed in hindsight, which distorts what 
was reasonable. In hindsight, answers to How could you not have known that 

122
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
the product design flaw would lead to multimillion-dollar lawsuits and the need 
for a litigation hold? can look very different. You want to preserve the thoughts 
and facts at the time of the decisions to demonstrate that you acted in good 
faith or reasonably.
Knowing when a hold delay makes 
you eligible for sanctions
Good news if you start late and didn’t lose ESI relevant to the case: The legal 
issue is whether the opposing party was harmed by the delay or lateness 
of the hold, not the timing of the hold. If there’s no evidence that relevant 
documents are destroyed, you dodged that bullet, but there’s often a price to 
pay in terms of time and sleeplessness.
Trying to use a delay to your self-interest is a sure ticket to a sanction. In 
2008, a paralegal filed a sexual harassment and constructive discharge action 
against her former employer and one of its partners. The law firm allowed the 
partner to continue working on his computer for over a year without taking 
any action to preserve discoverable ESI on the computer. The partner testi­
fied that because he had deleted the e-mail with explicit images and contin­
ued using the computer, the deleted e-mails had probably been overwritten 
and unrecoverable. Not surprisingly, the courts did not agree. Whether rel­
evant documents ever existed on the partner’s computer did not negate the 
fact, according to the court, that defendants failed to meet their obligations 
to preserve the partner’s computer files. The jury was told that neither the 
law firm nor the partner took steps to preserve the partner’s computer elec­
tronic records or e-mail (an adverse instruction).
Accounting for downsizing and 
departing employees
Downsizing companies redistribute computers, cellphones, PDAs, and com­
puter files from departing employees. Additionally, digital devices might 
depart with the employee, be dropped accidentally in front of a moving 
vehicle, or become auction items on eBay. Employees who are retiring, 
being fired or promoted, or quitting create similar hard-to-hold situations. 
Unmanaged redistribution of equipment contributes to losing ESI pertinent to 
an existing litigation hold.
When ESI is gone, any explaining you do has little chance of avoiding sanc­
tions. Arguing that key pieces of evidence are lost because an employee was 
promoted or fired won’t get you sympathy from the court. Your obligation to 
manage litigation hold procedures effectively doesn’t have escape clauses for 
employee departures.

123
 Chapter 7: Complying with ESI Preservation and a Litigation Hold
Protection from losses because of employee departures or transitions 
includes the following actions:
	
✓	Retain ESI of departing employees. Keep all data from departing 
employees until you receive verification in writing that the data is not 
subject to litigation hold. 
	
✓	Suspend wiping of hard drives. Don’t wipe hard drives or redistribute 
computers.
	
✓	Track who’s leaving. Check the names of departing employees against 
the names of employees whose ESI is subject to litigation hold. Record 
contact information of departing staff.
	
✓	Keep new custodians up-to-date. Issue litigation hold notices to new 
custodians.
	
✓	Keep your e-discovery plan up-to-date. Examine litigation hold proce­
dures regularly to ensure that they’re working. 
Throwing a Wrench into 
Digital Recycling
The litigation hold requires that you suspend any routines that could delete 
or alter ESI. Doing so can be challenging. Here are some of the operations 
that need to stop:
	
✓	Suspend automatic deletion systems, system upgrades, and recycling 
of back-up tapes. You read more in the upcoming “Suspending destruc­
tive processes” section.
	
✓	Tell employees not to install or uninstall software programs or defrag 
their hard drives. These activities could cause the loss of potential ESI if 
employees mess up the install or defrag and destroy their computers.
Suspending destructive processes
Many company-wide information and e-mail systems are automated to per­
form (delete, overwrite, or archive ESI) tasks based on timing, volume limits, 
or other criteria. Any automatic system to purge ESI is fine, as long as there’s 
a way to turn it off so you aren’t destroying documents you need to preserve. 
A common destructive process is the reformatting and redistributing of com­
puters or hard drives. In Padgett v. City of Monte Sereno (2007), the defendant 
was sanctioned when an employee, who did not know of the pending litiga­
tion, reformatted the hard drive of a custodian of relevant ESI. The court held 

124
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
that the defendant failed to take adequate precautions to preserve the co-
worker’s computer equipment.
If you have an electronic records management (ERM) policy defining how 
to retain and dispose of ESI, you can be shielded from sanctions. You read 
about prelitigation ERM in Chapter 14.
ESI retention policies have shielded defendants from sanctions. In Gippetti v. 
United Parcel Service Inc. (2008), the plaintiff sought spoliation sanctions after 
alleging that the defendant had destroyed relevant ESI. The ESI at issue were 
UPS employees’ driving records. The defendant responded that some of the 
requested documents were destroyed as part of their routine ESI retention 
policy. According to policy, driving records are deleted to cope with sheer 
volume. The court did not sanction the defendant because of their routine 
and reasonable policy. However, the court in Doe v. Norwalk (2007) recog­
nized that not following a retention policy or not consistently following a 
policy is the same as not having one.
	
Verifying that you have an ERM program doesn’t matter with the court if you 
don’t follow it. 
The court in Keithley v. Homestore.com, Inc. (2008) ordered severe financial 
sanctions and an adverse inference when defendants failed to issue a written 
document retention policy after its duty to preserve had arisen. The court 
fined them $250,000 and gave the jury an adverse inference instruction.
Don’t overlook the risk of criminal sanctions, such as obstruction of justice. 
Read about sanctions in Chapter 5.
Where do you put a terabyte?
E-discovery can easily reach tens of thousands of documents and several 
terabytes. This may involve stopping routine document destruction, recy­
cling of backup tapes, disk defragmentation or compression, and instructing 
employees to refrain from deleting documents. The point is that you may 
need to hold onto and put huge amounts of ESI somewhere during the litiga­
tion hold to preserve it. Here are two preservation protocols:
	
✓	Preserve in place: The litigation hold is put on ESI that may be material 
to your case at their source, typically the file or e-mail server. In-place 
litigation holds can be implemented, sometimes quickly, in one or both 
of the following ways:
 
• Suspend routine destruction or recycling. The IT department stops 
its standard procedures. For large automated tape libraries, it’s 
not realistic to expect to suspend these operations immediately.

125
 Chapter 7: Complying with ESI Preservation and a Litigation Hold
 
• Restrict access or use. Lock any potential material ESI where it 
resides on the network by modifying file permissions to restrict 
what can be done with or to the files or data. For example, permis­
sion to files could be restricted to read-only so users would still be 
able to read but not alter them.
	
✓	Collect to preserve: As the case advances, moving the ESI to central 
repositories may be necessary so that people (legal team, IT staff, ven­
dors, remote users) can access the ESI from any location. Native ESI 
comes in various formats, so you need more than one repository. You 
want to use one repository for e-mail, another for documents, and so on. 
Rounding up the ESI helps minimize the risk of data or metadata spolia­
tion if you do the following:
 
• Notify data users and custodians by sending a collection notice.
 
• Use a collection process that preserves the ESI, its metadata and 
embedded data; and that documents the chain of custody and 
authenticity.
 
• Tag the responsive ESI, move it to a new server, and verify that the 
transfer was successful.
Implementing the Litigation Hold
When the litigation hold is triggered, you and your counsel should meet to 
ensure that you have an appropriate policy in place to protect the relevant 
ESI and to avoid loss or destruction of the relevant ESI.
You take the following steps to begin the litigation hold:
	
1.	Review the scope of the ESI to be preserved.
	
	 Be aware that the scope may be larger than what is alluded to in a pres­
ervation letter. Include any IT people and both in-house and litigation 
counsel in this review.
	
	 Be careful anytime you receive an overbroad preservation letter. Use 
your best collective judgment as to what will be relevant ESI. Ask your 
lawyer whether opposing counsel can limit the preservation request. 
Consider writing a letter to the opposing counsel (and keeping a copy) 
outlining what you will do, and the cost of what you won’t do along with 
the offer to do it if the requesting party pays. If that fails, seek help from 
the court. Judges are not kind to parties who try to use a hatchet rather 
than a scalpel.
	
2.	Identify the relevant ESI, the key players in the litigation hold, and 
the various locations of the ESI.
	
	 You need to know what ESI is needed, who has it, and where it is. The 
data map is your guide.

126
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
	
3.	Determine what steps are necessary to both protect and collect the 
relevant ESI.
	
	 Verify that those steps are feasible and that they’d achieve what you 
expect.
	
4.	Implement a document retention plan if you don’t already have one.
	
	 To implement the plan:
 
• Notify all persons who might possess relevant ESI for the litigation 
hold and the steps they are required to take under the plan.
 
• Monitor the implementation of the plan on an ongoing basis.
	
5.	Where necessary, limit access to systems or machines that may have 
relevant ESI. 
	
	 In some cases, a person may want to rewrite history by getting rid of the 
device that stores it. You’ll want to prevent them from doing so.
	
6.	Establish the format for production of the relevant ESI.
When your company hires a litigation lawyer (separate from any in-house 
lawyers your company might have), that lawyer determines what’s happened 
and collects any written documents that logs the steps you’ve taken. These 
logs will be used to demonstrate good faith compliance efforts.
Producing such documentation, including the actual hold notice, may not be 
ordered by the court. Hold notices are protected under attorney-client privi­
lege and attorney work-product doctrine. You don’t want to waive either pro­
tection. At some point, the judge may order you to produce your notices and 
memos. As with the logs, those documents are critical when an e-discovery 
dispute arises.
Courts give varying degrees of protection to the hold notice. At an early stage 
in one case, the court ordered the responding party to disclose informa­
tion contained in the litigation notice, including the names and titles of 600 
employees who received the hold notice. In re eBay Seller Antitrust Litigation 
(2007), the court said that details of the responding party’s employees’ ESI 
collection and preservation efforts would be fair game not only in the meet-
and-confer session, but also in a deposition notice of a person familiar with 
those efforts. However, the defendant in the eBay litigation was not required 
to disclose the actual notice or any of its privileged contents.
	
Your lawyer has an obligation to oversee the litigation process and to ensure 
compliance. This is an ongoing obligation not just at the start of the hold.

127
 Chapter 7: Complying with ESI Preservation and a Litigation Hold
Documenting that custodians 
are in compliance
Zubulake says you must notify the key players personally about the litiga­
tion hold, but notification isn’t enough. Employees should understand the 
consequences of failing to comply, and know where to get help when they 
have questions. In addition, you need to get acknowledgments from employ­
ees and data custodians that they’ve received, understand, and are able to 
comply with a litigation hold. If they fail to comply, the blame falls on you 
because blame-shifting is not in the rules. Your lawyer needs to take affirma­
tive steps to ensure that you’re monitoring compliance correctly. 
As you’re documenting where ESI is and who has it, start a preservation log 
(see Figure 7-3). These come in handy during the e-discovery process.

Rounding up what needs to be collected
Rule 34 states that electronic records and communications are subject to 
subpoena and discovery for use in legal proceedings. Under Rule 34, the 
phrase under control doesn’t require that you have legal ownership or actual 
physical possession of the documents at issue. Documents are considered to 
be under your control when you have the right, authority, or practical ability 
to obtain the documents from a non-party to the action.
	
A preservation letter that makes unreasonable or overbroad demands on 
a litigant or their operations won’t be complied with and the courts won’t 
enforcement it. Letters need to be specific and detailed. Don’t send a “save it 
all” letter. 
The contents of the letter help you achieve one or more goals:
	
✓	Makes sure the relevant ESI you think a person has is going to be there 
when you need it.
	
✓	Educates your opponent of their duty to prevent data destruction and 
data loss.

128
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
	
✓	Establishes a basis for your claim of spoliation against your opponent 
because your opponent can’t claim ignorance.
	
✓	Establishes a basis for your claim of bad faith against your opponent for 
disregarding the duty to preserve relevant evidence.
You can issue a letter to a party or a non-party that you believe has ESI 
needed for your case.
Be sure to address the following points in the preservation letter:
	
✓	Spell out the nature of the dispute, litigation, or investigation.
	
✓	Name key individuals, dates, events, locations, departments, and any 
other facts that are known.
	
✓	Identify the types of ESI to be preserved. In this identification, you can 
either list general categories, such as e-mails relevant to an issue in 
dispute, or precisely identify specific e-mail on an issue between two or 
more named individuals. 
	
✓	Warn the opponent not to delete, destroy, or modify any relevant mate­
rial, even in the routine operation of its computer systems.
	
✓	Tell the opponent to suspend its normal retention policy and not 
destroy any relevant material until further notice.
	
✓	Ask them to distribute the preservation notice to all persons who may 
have relevant material in their possession and control, and document 
who’s received the notice.
	
✓	Ask them to find out whether there’s anyone else who should also 
receive the notice.
	
✓	Ask that the preservation notice be kept updated and send reminders of 
the preservation obligations to recipients.
	
✓	Provide the name of a contact person in case there are any questions 
about the litigation hold.
	
✓	Ask for acknowledgment that the preservation letter was received. This 
might be a certified mail receipt although, ideally, you want confirma­
tion of receipt and that they intend to comply.
We present three sample preservation letters depending on the recipient. 
The preservation letters might be to a party, as shown in Figure 7-4; to a non-
party, as shown in Figure 7-5; or to the client, as shown in Figure 7-6.

Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
Judging whether a forensics-level 
preservation is needed
Preservation depends on people and actions that are out of your control. 
One method to ensure preservation is to make a forensics copy of the ESI on 
hard drives of computers or flash drives of handhelds. Computer forensics 
involves the use of specialized techniques for finding and recovering elec­
tronic evidence, preserving it, and authenticating and analyzing it.
Questions to ask at this time are the following: Does this case require a foren­
sics level of data preservation? Would you benefit from the use of a forensics 
approach? These are important decisions to be made at this time. You might 
not implement forensics until later in the case or you may have no choice but 
to do so at this time.
Computer forensics methods and tools can be used to
	
✓	Discover, recover, and collect ESI
	
✓	Preserve documents, e-mail, and metadata
	
✓	Search and analyze the documents, e-mail, and metadata 
	
✓	Authenticate the ESI
	
✓	Create and preserve the chain of custody
You often need computer forensics tools and techniques in cases that involve 
current or former employees. Asking the person who’s suspected of commit­
ting a crime or who’s suing you to preserve their ESI has obvious flaws.
Forensics is needed in s of fraud, employee misconduct, or misuse of corpo­
rate IT resources, theft of intellectual property, or crimes in which the per­
petrator tried to hide their actions by deleting e-mail messages, files, or logs. 
However, it’s an extra expense and disruption (while the forensics image is 
being made of the computer or handheld) so computer forensics may not be 
needed in the case if the effort is not proportional to the amount in contro­
versy or other risks.
A computer forensics expert can help you understand the fundamentals of 
recovering, analyzing, and authenticating ESI. The use of computer forensic 
preservation is increasing even in matters that seem straightforward (one 
with no disputes). Cases starting with forensic analysis requests typically 
start or are expected to evolve into high-volume e-discovery matters. And 
some cases need the unbiased analysis provided by computer forensics. 
If you find yourself in need of a computer forensics specialist, check out 
Chapter 13, where we talk about how computer forensics and e-discovery 
work together.

Chapter 8
Managing e-Discovery 
Conferences and Protocols
In This Chapter
▶	Meeting the obligations of the meet-and-confer session
▶	Agreeing on the scope of e-discovery
▶	Selecting a timetable
▶	Designating the Rule 30(b)(6) witness
▶	Evaluating both party’s interests
W
hen you’re served with a lawsuit, you must get your e-discovery plan 
rolling from day one. The first 120 days of litigation are perhaps the 
most critical days if you want to be successful. Your lawyer is required to 
meet with the opposing party in order to move the case forward and develop 
a plan to proceed. Among the most important aspects of this meeting — 
called the meet-and-confer meeting — are the discussions of issues related to 
ESI preservation, production, and protection.
In this chapter, you find out what goes on in the meet-and-confer session 
and how to help your lawyer prepare and successfully negotiate the process. 
Though it is early, it can be a make or break moment for your case. If your 
lawyer is properly prepared, he can provide both leverage and protection for 
your case.
Complying with the Meet-
and-Confer Session
Early in the litigation stage, your lawyer meets with the opposition and dis­
cusses what ESI you have and how you intend to collect, preserve, and hand 
it over. The opposing side gives your lawyer the same information for their 
side so your lawyer can start building your case. This is the meet-and-confer 
meeting. This meeting is important to have because, as you can imagine, the 

134
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
two sides don’t always agree on what ESI should be handed over and 
in what format. Hashing out an agreement on what is expected and setting 
time frames for discovery help you move forward with your case and build 
a strategy.
Rule 26(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCP) says that the 
meet-and-confer meeting must be held by day 99. (See Chapter 1 for a discus­
sion of the timing.) You may find that the meet-and-confer meeting happens 
earlier because a local rule takes precedent over the federal rule. The local 
rule may also allow for your attorney to report orally on the conference 
rather than in writing.
	
Check with your lawyer to determine whether you’re governed by a local rule. 
You must comply with an applicable local rule even if it is at odds with the 
FRCP.
The meet-and-confer session is required unless there’s an exemption (Rule 
26(a)(1)(B) provides one) or the court says otherwise. Your lawyer needs 
to go into the meet-and-confer session armed with information you give him 
about your ESI, its condition, and an overview of your retention policies. This 
requires that you get the e-discovery team up and running in a short period 
of time (see Chapter 6 if you need to put your e-discovery team together).
Rule 26 requires that you and your lawyer confer in good faith. Failure to do 
so could result in sanctions. Rule 26(f)(2) instructs you to consider:
	
✓	The nature and basis of your claims and defenses
	
✓	The possibilities of promptly settling the case
	
✓	The required disclosures of discoverable information that may support 
your claims or defenses
	
✓	Any preservation issues
	
✓	A proposed discovery plan, which covers the following points:
 
• Any changes in the timing or form of disclosures
 
• The subjects that may require discovery and when you expect 
them to be completed, including any limitations that are requested
 
• The issues relative to the disclosure of ESI including the form of 
production
 
• Any issues dealing with privilege or protection and any agreements
 
• Any changes or limitations or other suggested orders
	
It is not required that you agree, only that you confer in good faith.
Figure 8-1 is Form 35 that your lawyer submits to the court, detailing what 
was discussed in the meet-and-confer session.

Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
The FRCP envisions a cooperative environment to reach a just result. If you 
don’t do your best to cooperate with the opposing side, judges can sanction 
you for e-discovery misconduct. Here are a couple of examples:
	
✓	In the case of In Re Seroquel Products Liability Litigation (2007), the court 
found that the defendants failed to understand their own records and 
documents and to prepare them for production. The court was unim­
pressed by the defendant’s preparation and participation, and agreed 
that they should be subject to sanctions, but reserved the type of sanc­
tion until a future date when the full impact of the defendant’s miscon­
duct could be determined.
	
✓	In Mikron Industries, Inc. v. Hurd Windows & Doors, Inc. (2008), the court 
refused to grant the defendant’s request for a protective order that 
would have allowed them not to produce certain ESI because the defen­
dant had not met and conferred in good faith. The court said that there 
should have been a substantive discussion regarding the defendants’ dif­
ficulty in producing responsive ESI, the extent to which defendants have 
searched ESI, and the foundation for defendants’ belief that a more thor­
ough search of ESI, including backup tapes, would yield only information 
that has already been produced. The plaintiff’s counsel stated that no 
meaningful discussion of the issues had taken place, and defendants 
submitted no evidence to dispute them.
Preparing for the Meet-
and-Confer Session
Rule 26(f) requires you to address four important areas of ESI for the meet-
and-confer session:
	
✓	Preservation of evidence
	
✓	Form of production
	
✓	Privilege or protection issue
	
✓	Any other issues
We discuss each of these in the following sections.
Preservation of evidence
You’re expected to attempt to reach an agreement on what ESI to preserve. 
When you discuss the meet-and-confer session with your lawyer, be sure to 
give him this information:

137
 Chapter 8: Managing e-Discovery Conferences and Protocols
	
✓	Who has the ESI: Simple enough, who are the custodians of the data?
	
✓	How the ESI has been preserved: Is it easily accessible or is it stored on 
a backup archive somewhere?
	
✓	How much it costs to retrieve the ESI: What will it cost in terms of time 
and money for you to get the ESI in shape to hand it over?
The court is generally unwilling to approve broad preservation orders that 
may be overly burdensome or impossible to comply with. However, if you 
agree to it, then the court is not sympathetic to your later complaints. Be 
prepared to deal with this issue and understand the costs and burdens asso­
ciated with preservation.
	
If you created a data map (see Chapter 6), get it out now because it most likely 
contains all the information you need.
	
Your attorney has an ongoing obligation to make sure that your company is 
properly disseminating, understanding, and complying with the litigation hold.
Form of production
Production can be an extremely important issue. Rule 34 allows you to 
specify the form of production. If you can’t agree to a form for handing over 
the ESI, you must hand over the ESI in the manner in which you usually main­
tain it or in another reasonably usable form. Refer to the Sedona Principles 
(www.thesedonaconference.org) for assistance in form production. In 
D’Onofrio v. SFX Sports Group, Inc. (2008), the court noted that the requesting 
party must be clear in what it is seeking.
	
The court in Autotech Techs Ltd. P’ship v. Automationdirect.com (2008) refused 
a request for metadata because the party had not requested it earlier. The 
court recognized that the requester was in the driver’s seat and “must be sat­
isfied with what it asked for.” If you want the metadata — data about the data — 
you must ask for it. Metadata is data generated by the computer and can show 
when and who created something (for example, a Word document). It can also 
show if and when revisions were made. This could be crucial in trying to show 
the authenticity of a document being offered into evidence.
Your attorney should go to the meet-and-confer session with a good under­
standing of the format in which you’ll produce ESI. Lack of specificity or an 
incomplete understanding of the technology could result in not getting you 
what you need. Be careful what you ask for because it may be all you get. 

138
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
Privileged or protected ESI
The third area you should address with your lawyer is any possible privilege 
or protection issues for ESI. Be prepared to compromise with the other party 
to deal with any possible inadvertent disclosure. These agreements may 
become part of the scheduling order of the court under Rule 16. 
One method to deal with inadvertent disclosure is the quick peek agreement, 
as shown in Figure 8-2. This agreement allows you to get a snapshot view of 
your opponent’s ESI before they constitute a waiver of privilege or protec­
tion. Once the quick peek has occurred, you can establish what you want and 
the format you want it in. Your opponent can still claim a waiver.
We talk more about privileged and protected ESI in Chapter 10.

Any other issues regarding ESI
You must also address any other issues that may arise regarding the ESI. 
These issues might include sources of ESI, relevant time periods, and the cus­
todians of the ESI — in other words, where is it and who has it!
A few crucial aspects of this last category of inquiry are trying to agree on 
	
✓	Search protocols
	
✓	Issues related to accessibility of the ESI
	
✓	The cost or burden of restoring inaccessible ESI
For example, if your company converted its word processor from WordStar 
to Microsoft Word in 1987, you may want to argue that you can only produce 
ESI created after 1987. If you can’t produce the earlier ESI, then you need to 
be prepared to discuss the costs and burden associated with the produc­
tion of those documents. You should be familiar with what is necessary for 
conversion and whether the same information is available through other 
sources.

In Williams v. Taser (2007), the parties could not reach agreement on search 
terms and would not budge from their original positions. The court ordered 
Taser to run 21 specific searches and produce all presumptively responsive 
documents. The only documents excluded were those with a claim of privilege 
or protection.
Agreeing on a Timetable
One of the purposes of the meet-and-confer session is to establish a timetable 
for discovery. If the agreed-upon timetable is reasonable, the court uses it as 
the basis of the scheduling order.
The judge puts together a scheduling order to provide a roadmap for the 
completion of the case, and it includes dates and issues on discovery. A 
scheduling order may include any agreements you’ve entered into regarding 
e-discovery. The court issues a scheduling order after receiving the meet-
and-confer report.
You should not overreach by setting an overly aggressive schedule. Likewise, 
after the schedule is set, you risk sanctions if you fail to comply. You can ask 
the court for additional time, but it’s best if you can agree to an amended 
timetable with your opposing party.

140
Part III: Identifying, Preserving, and Collecting ESI 
Selecting a Rule 30(b)(6) Witness
During the course of discovery, you can take a deposition of any person 
that may have relevant information about the case. A deposition is not done 
before the court but the witness is sworn in by a court reporter and ques­
tioned by the attorneys. The testimony is recorded and reduced to writing. 
In the interest of saving the time and cost of taking multiple depositions, 
FRCP Rule 30(b)(6) allows you to name the people you want to be deposed 
on behalf of your corporation, partnership, association, or government 
agency. The requesting party provides a description of the matters that they 
wants to examine. Depending on what they want, you can choose the best 
person to testify. This usually includes information on information pertaining 
to your system, data retention policy, implementation of the litigation hold, 
and location of ESI. But it can be much broader. Your attorney may object 
if she believes the requested information is not subject to discovery. The 
person selected as your Rule 30(b)(6) witness also testifies at the trial.
While you’re preparing for the meet-and-confer session, think about who 
should serve as the Rule 30(b)(6) witness. This is the best time to do it and 
your selection will be discussed at the conference.
	
Making this decision before the meet-and-confer session is much more effi­
cient. It is not necessary to engage in discovery to figure out whom to depose.
The person you select does not need to have any direct knowledge of the 
case or be the most knowledgeable on the issues in the case. For example, 
a person may know nothing about your specific case but is knowledgeable 
about the systems, platforms, locations of ESI, and policies of your company. 
If that is what is requested, that person is your best Rule 30(b)(6) witness. 
In fact, in some cases, it may be advantageous to have someone that is not 
directly involved with the case to avoid any emotions tainting the witness.
In determining who should be the Rule 30(b)(6) witness, you and your attor­
ney need to review the subpoena and matters that are subject to the deposi­
tion. This review helps you narrow the field of potential witnesses. Then your 
attorney should meet with all the proposed witnesses to determine who she 
believes is most knowledgeable but also who she believes would be a better 
witness. You want to present your most convincing witness, and some people 
aren’t convincing witnesses.
If you fail to designate a Rule 30(b)(6) witness, you can be sanctioned under 
Rule 37. While seldom done, you may risk the sanctions rather than expose 
the testimony because information might be revealed that is detrimental to 
your case. 

141
 Chapter 8: Managing e-Discovery Conferences and Protocols
You can designate more than one person and it need not be a current 
employee. Designate the person with care if that person has duties in the 
organization; the deposition could elicit testimony that may lead to addi­
tional discovery that you might not want revealed.
	
Take care in deciding who will be designated and properly educate them on 
the matters for examination and the process itself. Make sure they’re comfort­
able being questioned by opposing counsel. Both your company and your 
Rule 30(b)(6) witness may be sanctioned for not being prepared. In Ideal 
Aerosmith, Inc. v. Acutronic USA, Inc. (2007), the court stated that there was no 
reason why the witness “could not have prepared himself, whether through 
documentation prepared by the consultant or conversations with him.” The 
judge found that the Rule 30(b)(6) witness was unable to answer even the 
basic foundation questions.
Finding Out You and the Opposing Party 
May Have Mutual Interests 
One of the great advantages of an effective meet-and-confer session is your 
ability to narrow the issues. One area that you’ll probably agree on is the 
reduction in costs. This may, however, not be the case if you and your oppo­
nent have disparate financial resources. Expenses related to ESI can be both 
astronomical and disproportional. You have a duty in the process of discov­
ery to consider whether the costs in relation to the amount in controversy — 
are the costs disproportional to the amount in controversy? Setting that 
aside, the costs of e-discovery nationwide are estimated to be in the billions 
of dollars.
The meet-and-confer session provides the opportunity to narrow the scope 
not only of discovery, but also of your entire case. After you determine the 
issues that are really in dispute, you can focus on discovery without judicial 
intervention.
	
If you’re prepared and you participate in good faith, a lot can be accomplished 
to move the case effectively and efficiently to a conclusion.

Par t IV
Processing, 
Protecting, and 
Producing ESI

In this part . . .
P
art IV takes you from the point of reviewing and pro­
cessing ESI in Chapter 9, through protecting privi­
lege and work product in Chapter 10, to the point where 
you package and produce on schedule all responsive, non­
privileged ESI to opposing counsel in Chapter 11.
In many cases, ESI review takes the lion’s share of the 
budget, and if done incorrectly, privileged documents can 
be leaked to the opponent, as you start to understand in 
Chapter 9. You learn why the key driver of costs, and 
waiver errors, is the number of documents that outside 
counsel must review for privilege and relevance. By filter­
ing and staging multiple reviews to reduce the ocean of 
ESI, you avoid being in the position of trying to boil the 
ocean when you only need a cup of tea. 
You learn how to block and tackle thorny legal issues in 
Chapter 10, and how to throw a few punches of your own. 
But protecting privilege, privacy, and work product is not 
all sport. You learn the necessity of maintaining detailed 
logs to the point of being obsessive/compulsive. At this 
stage, you’re trying to argue that you don’t need to pro­
duce ESI, regardless of its relevance, because you know 
that it’s protected by privilege, work product, or privacy. 
Amidst all the challenges at this stage of e-discovery, you 
also learn the value of agreements with the opposing side, 
which you’ll want the court to make official. 
In Chapter 11, you find out about the costs and risks you 
face when producing and releasing ESI. You read that 
metadata is a hidden threat when releasing ESI to an 
opposing party because it might reveal things you wanted 
to keep under wraps. Mistakes here, as in prior stages, 
can undermine your trial strategies or worse.

▶	Distinguishing hits and misses

▶	All eyeballs (and review software) on deck
E
lectronic discovery becomes even more intense when the processing 
phase arrives. To get ESI ready for review and analysis, you might have 
any amount — a 1GB pile to multi-terabyte mountains — of discovery docu­
ments to process and index to get them into searchable shape for filtering. 
Using proprietary or commercially available software to index the documents 
and filter out duplicate and meaningless ones takes a big bite out of the 
volume of ESI to be reviewed. Review is the highest cost line item on most 
e-discovery bills, so less really costs much less.
During these procedures, ESI undergoes a bag-and-tag-and-bag sequence. 
Indexed ESI is stored on a secured accessible platform (bag) for filtering; 
files are tagged as relevant, privileged, confidential, discard, damaged, and 
so on; then files tagged as relevant, nonprivileged, and non-work product 
ESI are bagged in order to meet production deadlines. Remember: You must 
organize and index any ESI that you’re planning to hand over so it’s ready for 
your opponent to review. Not organizing and indexing ESI can carry a sanc­
tion and re-work.
In this chapter, you learn the art and science of processing, filtering, and 
review. You read why documenting every decision creates a shield to coun­
ter attacks from opponents. You read about systematic sampling and trial-
and-error search methods to pare data. Search methods that amount to 

146

little more than wild grasps and shots in the dark won’t survive challenge. 
Planning your process-filter-review work around the amounts at issue in the 
case, and then carrying out that plan, minimizes your cost and risk.
Planning, Tagging, and Bagging
After identifying the key custodians and relevant sources of ESI (see Chapter 7) 
and preserving and collecting ESI (see Chapter 8), you arrive at the costly tasks 
of processing, filtering, and reviewing the data and documents.
At the process, filter, and review stages, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Define the outcome you want and what you need to achieve it.
	
	 Start by planning. Determine what needs to be done, the alternative 
ways in which it can be done, and then decide how you’ll proceed. As 
you can read in Chapter 3, your emphasis in the plan might shift from 
the budget, to the scope, to the schedule as deadlines near and nerves 
fray.
	
2.	 Perform an early case assessment.
	
	 Take a realistic look at the elements of the case, what types of e-evidence 
there are and their strengths, and the intent and staying power of both 
yourself and your opponent. You need to figure out your position. Then, 
like in poker, hold, fold, or bluff.
	
3.	 Process and index the preserved ESI.
	
	 Preserved ESI is not in searchable condition until you’ve processed and 
indexed it using specialized software offered by many e-discovery ven­
dors and consulting firms, such as Kazeon, FIOS, EMC SourceOne, Xerox 
Litigation Services, Clearwell, MindTalent, and Quest. Most software 
packages index the ESI prior to processing to expedite the searches. 
Several vendors provide litigation support platforms where ESI is fil­
tered, searched, and reviewed for responsiveness, privilege, trade 
secrets, and other matters. 
	
4.	 Filter the processed ESI. 
	
	 The ESI is put through multiple searches, including keyword, data, 
custodian, time frame, and conceptual filtering deduping; and near-
duplicate processing, to separate the relevant responsive ESI from that 
which is not. The software may filter the ESI through the Reference 
Data Set (RDS) of the National Software Reference Library (NSRL) (www.
nsrl.nist.gov). The RDS is a collection of digital signatures of known 
system files and software applications. Filtering out these non-responsive 
files reduces your load.

147
 Chapter 9: Processing, Filtering, and Reviewing ESI
	
5.	Review and analyze the filtered ESI. 
	
	 Review is a fine-tuned filtering of the ESI to identify irrelevant, privileged, 
work product, and other ESI that is protected from disclosure. Redacting 
documents might be done at this stage. Review does not necessar­
ily require someone sitting and reading each page. Review decisions 
depend on what’s at stake, the time frame, ethical obligations, and the 
FRCP, as you read about in Chapter 10.
	
To bend (shorten) timelines when interim milestones or final production dates 
are closing in, these phases can overlap. For example, as the e-mail reposi­
tory is processed, filtering can begin on that batch, and then the document 
repository can go into processing. As ESI moves along, you can be processing, 
filtering, and reviewing different batches or chunks of ESI concurrently. If doc­
uments are being processed in small chunks, these documents can be made 
available as they become available. This approach is called rolling production 
and can occur over a short time or over a year or more.
Taking a finely tuned approach
Searching data and files might seem like second nature to you. Who goes 
a day without searching the Internet, an address book, a retail Web site, a 
flight’s status, or some type of database?
Computer search software, most notably Google Desktop (http://desk
top.google.com), the Microsoft Windows search utility (part of the Start 
menu), and Internet search engines are handy tools for finding information, 
but they operate like excavators. They grab a lot and aren’t too particular 
about what they grab. They’re also not particular about what they don’t 
grab. Also, search tools can demand too much precision. For example, if you 
search your laptop for a document containing the phrase “inadvertent disclo­
sure,” and you misspell the term in the document or as the search term, the 
search utility won’t find the document. Of course, if you misspell the phrase 
both times the exact same way, you’re in luck. Overall, basic search engines 
are strong, but sloppy. In contrast, e-discovery duties and the courts demand 
a more discriminating and intelligent search methodology that’s capable of 
finer precision.
Finding exactly what you need
To visualize the complexity of the search task, look at the symbols represent­
ing files stored on a single hard drive in Figure 9-1.
Assume each wingding represents a file category, such as an e-mail message, 
a word processing document, a personal instant message sent or received, 
a music file, a photo, a computer virus or spyware, a trade secret or other 

148
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
proprietary document, a work product or privileged document, an encrypted 
file, a deleted file, and so on. General groupings are easy because of easily 
identifiable distinctions. The easiest method of identifying a group of files 
is to use the three-letter or four-letter file extension. But file extensions can 
be changed accidentally or easily to disguise the file and, therefore, can’t be 
trusted. Computer forensics experts use software tools to discover all data 
that might exist on computers and other storage media, and then to retrieve 
the ESI in a way that a chain of custody and authenticity can support.
Consider the challenges. Unless a privileged document or e-mail is labeled as 
such, how can search software distinguish it from nonprivileged documents 
or e-mails? Computers don’t really search; instead, they match. A résumé 
that states, “I don’t have a Harvard MBA,” would be selected by a search pro­
tocol looking for those words or credentials just as it would a résumé legiti­
mately listing “Harvard MBA.” Review would hopefully catch the discrepancy.
Similar problems exist with e-mail messages containing disclaimers that may 
or may not disqualify them from disclosure. Non-relevant personal e-mail 
messages and relevant case-related e-mail messages can look alike. (This 
is roughly the time when the litigation team complains about the lax e-mail 
usage policy that co-mingles business and personal messages.)

 Chapter 9: Processing, Filtering, and Reviewing ESI
You now recognize the inherent problems with filtering methods and why 
your opponents and the court will scrutinize your methodology, not just your 
results. The good news is that your processing, filtering, and review pro­
cedures are judged in terms of whether they are reasonable relative to the 
issues and value of the case. 
Enlisting an experienced technical expert to help define and defend your ESI 
search methodology is not only a smart investment, but also a necessary 
one. The expert may persuade the court that your efforts were reasonable 
and proportional to the case.
	
Litigators may need to explain and demonstrate with appropriate documenta­
tion that the filtering and review methods were reasonable, given the amounts 
at issue in the case. Your lawyer depends on you to a large extent for the doc­
umentation. In U.S. v. O’Keefe (2008), Judge John Facciola colorfully concluded 
that the selection of keyword search terms is “best left to experts” and not to 
lawyers. 
Stop and identify yourself
Processing, filtering, and reviewing of ESI depend on the ability to identify and 
make distinctions, a job that cannot be done using an excavation approach. 
Here are a few of the many tricky identifications and distinctions that, if done 
correctly, reduce the volume of ESI to only what you’re obligated to produce:
	
✓	Identify duplicates. Check your work e-mail account and you’ll find mes­
sages that were sent to a distribution list or sent via a reply all. You can 
discard all but one of each of these messages as duplicates.
	
✓	Distinguish final versions from drafts. Being able to distinguish drafts 
of documents from the final official version not only reduces volume, 
but also reduces the risk of releasing plans that were never adopted or 
quality control problems that were remedied. 
	
	Unedited drafts might be key evidence depending on the nature of your 
case.
	
✓	Distinguish near-duplicates from one-of-a-kinds. Documents may be 
converted to portable digital format (PDF) or compressed into a Zip file. 
Having the same document in different formats is unnecessary.
	
✓	Identify documents according to creation or modification dates. 
Documents whose created, generated, accessed, or printed dates are 
before or after the relevant date range are not material to the case 
unless the dates are misleading. For example, when a file is re-used or 
used as a template, the dates may be false, as shown in Figure 9-2. The 
file properties in Figure 9-2 show that the file was printed on February 
20, 2008 and that the file was created on June 6, 2009 — more than 15 
months later.

ment’s date

Two wrongs and a right
If your memory of statistics is a bit rusty, here are terms you come across 
when sampling:
	
✓	False positives: A document or file is marked as relevant when it’s not. 
False positives result in overinclusiveness. These errors increase the 
amount of ESI to review, which increases the time and cost of review, as 
shown in Figure 9-3.
	
✓	False negatives: A document or file is marked as non-relevant when it is 
relevant. The result is underinclusiveness. These kinds of errors result 
in files that should be reviewed and possibly produced being tossed into 
the discard pile (as shown in Figure 9-3). These errors increase the risk 
of accusation or sanction for not producing all responsive ESI. 
	
	Keep the discards and sample them as well. 
	
✓	Just right: A document or file is marked correctly as relevant when it 
is relevant, or marked non-relevant when it’s not. Achieving perfection 
costs more and might require more time than you have.

 Chapter 9: Processing, Filtering, and Reviewing ESI
	
You process and search only the reasonably accessible ESI. If you process 
and review not reasonably accessible ESI, you can change its status to rea­
sonably accessible because you deflated the basis of your argument against 
producing it. 
Learning through Trial and Error
In uncharted or uncertain conditions, people often figure out what works and 
what doesn’t through trial and error. Inventors Thomas Edison and Benjamin 
Franklin used this method. More importantly, the court expects that you use 
the trial-and-error approach and document your results with each trial.
The general trial-and-error process consists of the following steps: 
	
1.	Select a sample upon which to run the trials.
	
2.	Perform a trial run on the sample using a selected approach.
	
	 For example, on a sample set of e-mail messages, perform a search for 
relevant ones using a set of keywords.
	
3.	Examine and document the results of your approach, both good 
and bad.
	
	 Testing the results of a particular search method can flag problems like 
the overinclusiveness or underinclusiveness of the filtering technique.
	
4.	Identify limitations of your approach.
	
5.	Make adjustments to the approach criteria.
	
	 If your search doesn’t get you what you want or if it returns too much, 
you refine and redo the search. Searches involve two types of criteria:
 
• Objective: Searches based on dates and custodians are objective 
criteria.
 
• Subjective: Searches based on keywords and context based on 
judgments are examples of subjective criteria.
	
6.	Repeat Steps 2 through 5 until you obtain the results you need.
	
You do a search to reduce the burden of review and the risk of sanctions for 
using a wild-guess approach. After, your legal team makes a final review of the 
relevant ESI before it’s released.

Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
Documenting the results of your trial-and-error method is critical for the 
following reasons:
	
✓	Case law: Judges look to your documentation for evidence of a system­
atic approach and not a self-serving approach.
	
✓	Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: The FRCP 26(g) requires good faith 
efforts, but also gives you some protection by mandating that efforts 
should be proportional to the costs and benefits.
	
✓	Federal Rules of Evidence: The FRE 502(c) waiver protection only 
applies if you took reasonable measures in your search. If not, your pro­
tection is gone.
Doing Early Case Assessment
Early case assessment tools can give you an initial perspective of the 
sources, scope, and types of potential relevant ESI. An early case assessment 
allows you to determine the position ESI puts your company in relative to 
litigation. Your attorney also needs the information you gather to prepare for 
the meet-and-confer session. An accurate early case assessment made by you 
can directly affect the case strategy and decision to fight or to settle.
Many e-discovery vendors provide a range of support services and automa­
tion tools for early case assessment. You should provide a short list of 
e-discovery vendors for your legal counsel to work with. 
There’s been considerable consolidation of e-discovery vendors, and that’s 
expected to continue. An e-discovery vendor has the ability to work with a 
your company’s IT staff to determine where documents are stored, in what 
format they are stored, and how the data can be retrieved in a way that 
doesn’t alter it. Electronic discovery vendors typically have equipment and 
personnel to access active and legacy data from e-mail, word processing, and 
other systems to be read and retrieved. Vendors help you convert collected 
ESI into a format that allows your lawyer to review and produce it. Here are 
several e-discovery vendors:
	
✓	Fios: www.fiosinc.com
	
✓	vdiscovery: www.vdiscovery.com
	
✓	AccessData: www.accessdata.com
	
✓	Kazeon: www.accessdata.com
	
✓	LexisNexis Applied Discovery Inc.: www.applieddiscovery.com

Vetting vendors
As you’re selecting your e-discovery vendor, keep these tips in mind:
	
✓	Get a good understanding of e-discovery issues, processes, and obli­
gations. You’re mastering e-discovery by reading this book. Bravo. 
Preferably, you should become knowledgeable before you have to face 
e-discovery issues and the clock starts ticking down to the meet-and-
confer session.
	
✓	Meet vendors before you need them. If you take the time to educate 
yourself about the vendors prior to actually needing them, you give 
yourself time to learn about vendors when you’re not under the stress 
of litigation. Review vendors’ Web sites to learn about their services and 
view their demos or Webinars. After this intelligence gathering, develop 
a short list of vendors and contact them. You need to know whether the 
vendor can support the volume and types of ESI your company has and 
get price estimates. 
	
✓	Get a live test using your ESI. You need to get past the marketing team 
and meet with those who actually do the work. Have the vendor create 
load files to import a test set of your ESI into litigation support data­
bases for a live demo. 
	
✓	Take the position that you’re partnering with a vendor for the long 
run. Every case is unique, and what’s subject to discovery will differ. But 
you’re not going to want to start from ground-zero with a new vendor 
each time you need one. Having a vendor on speed-dial hopefully won’t 
be necessary. 
	
✓	Check references. Ask vendors you’re considering for references. Call 
and ask clients about competence, responsiveness, turnaround time, 
accuracy of cost estimates, and project management skills. 
E-discovery technology arms race
Rapid advances in the scale, security, and 
usability of e-discovery software have reduced 
the time lawyers, paralegals, and litigation 
teams need to search, dedupe, filter, review, 
disclose, and prepare documents for a hear­
ing or trial. Electronic discovery services pro­
viders may offer individual services, project 
management, or comprehensive one-stop 
litigation support. Competition and improve­
ments in technology have driven prices down. 
According to an estimate by Legal Week in the 
United Kingdom, a large e-discovery project 
undertaken in 2004 that took six months and 
cost more than £500,000 could be completed in 
2009 within days and cost less than £10,000.

Breaking Out the ESI
ESI that’s been put on hold is in no condition to be searched efficiently or effec­
tively. It needs to be processed; that is, transformed into a searchable format. 
Processing is done using specialized software by an in-house technology staff 
or a third-party vendor or consulting firm. ESI must be processed following 
legally defensible procedures, which e-discovery support firms know.
Not all media you’ve identified and preserved may need to be processed. The 
type of case, the data sources, and the number of custodians influence how 
best to determine what needs to be processed. Risks stemming from reduc­
ing the amount of ESI include
	
✓	Excluding potential key evidence that’s beneficial to your case
	
✓	Violating e-discovery obligations resulting in sanctions, an adverse 
inference instruction, or worse, even if there was no bad faith or gross 
negligence
The transformations done during processing depend on the software and the 
level of service provided by the vendor or consulting firm. Processing plug-
ins or add-ins may be available to expand the range of processing. Relevant 
ESI might already be filtered during identification and collection stages if date 
restrictors and key search terms were used to extract relevant ESI from data 
repositories. Or the ESI may consist of entire laptops, network directories, 
workstations, or other media. 
In any case, processing ESI, done either by third-party vendors or in-house IT 
staff, includes these tasks:
	
✓	Standardizes file formats. Files need to be converted.
	
✓	Performs document-type specific data extraction. Files may need to 
be extracted. For example, zipped files need to be unzipped, and e-mail 
attachments must be separated out.
	
✓	Removes repetitive copies. A first pass file deduplication is made to 
reduce the volume. 
	
✓	Removes system files. Software files, such as Microsoft Office applications 
and non–user-created files, are typically not relevant and are removed.
	
✓	Creates an inventory of ESI. A list of the ESI is created to serve as 
documentation. 

155
 Chapter 9: Processing, Filtering, and Reviewing ESI
	
✓	Extracts metadata. Metadata might be extracted so it can be searched. 
Metadata describes a file or its properties, such as who created the file 
and when it was created or last accessed. 
	
✓	Detects e-mail threads. We’re all familiar with e-mails that contain 
replies, or threads. Because e-mail is the leading form of e-evidence, 
detecting the progression of messages is important.
	
✓	Exports the ESI. The resulting pool of ESI is exported in an appropriate 
review database. Subsequent filtering and review of the ESI is done on 
this pool, together with its index. The ESI may be exported in its native 
form for review or converted to image, text, or HTML. Native review is 
most common and beneficial because it preserves the metadata. 
	
	Review format might depend on the type of review tools the review team 
uses or it might be determined by agreements made about the form of 
production.
	
✓	Creates an index and word-frequency list. The processing software 
examines the files; finds words and names; and adds them to a master 
index of the words, terms, and filenames. This is similar to the index of a 
book. If you look up meet and confer in this book’s index, you see a list­
ing of the pages that contain the phrase.
	
	The index created by processing is actually a database of every word, 
term, and name contained in the volume of ESI. It lists the frequency or 
number of times the word appears in the ESI repository.
Processing software can index several different types of data, most com­
monly e-mail, word processing documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, database 
files, and Web browsing history logs. When selecting processing software, be 
alert to its limitations and do the following:
	
✓	Verify that the software is capable of processing your file types. Not 
all processing software can process all types of files, such as object link­
ing and embedded (OLE) files, an example of which is an Excel graph 
embedded within a Word document. Other tough files to crack are 
encrypted and password-protected files.
	
✓	Check the capability of the software to create an index that meets 
your needs. An index is a database that is limited in size. For example, 
Google Desktop only indexes 100,000 files per drive during the initial 
indexing period, which might be insufficient for users with large hard 
drives. 
	
Provide your legal team with a list of your keyword search results because 
they’ll need it at the meet-and-confer session. The index created during pro­
cessing is a detailed view of potential keywords and their frequency.
New and improved techniques for processing and reviewing data are evolv­
ing to mitigate risks, lower costs, and improve efficiency. Even if you partner 
with a vendor or consulting firm, check on their capabilities.

156
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
Crafting the Hunt
You identify ESI that’s likely to be relevant by performing searches using key­
words and other methods that have the power to discriminate between hits 
(relevant ESI) and discards (non-relevant ESI) with reasonably high reliability.
Given the volume of ESI, you need the help of experts to devise a list of key­
words and then test the results and refine the list via trial and error. Search 
terms and other restrictors need to be discussed internally with your entire 
e-discovery team and externally with the opposing party. 
Most search results, or data sets, have false positives. Refining search que­
ries can minimize those false hits. See the earlier section, “Using Trial-and-
Error,” for information on refining your search queries.
	
A single fire-and-forget search method is not scientific. An iterative process of 
examining, thinking, evaluating the process to determine if you can do better, 
and refining the process is a defensible method.
Deciding on filters
On all decisions about search methods, you should come to an agreement 
with the opposing counsel or by court consent regarding the search protocol 
so you can avoid discovery disputes. 
Here are the filters that require decisions. These filters are fact-based objec­
tives and produce rather clean results:
	
✓	File size and type filtering: You may notice files on your computer that 
start with a tilde [~] and a dollar sign [$], as shown in Figure 9-4, or that 
end in .tmp. These are all temporary files that you know you didn’t 
create. One .tmp file can generate many of these types of files because 
they may serve as a backup in Windows.
	
	Filter out files that are 1K in size or that end in .tmp because they’re not 
generated by the user and most likely are duplicates. 
	
	In contrast, you can filter to select what file types to include in the ESI 
pool. When an agreement is reached with opposing party or the court on 
file types, for example spreadsheets and e-mail, then you use the filter 
to select those files. (You may need to use computer forensics software 
to confirm actual file types because the software doesn’t rely on the file 
extension to find files.)
	
✓	Custodian filtering: Reducing the number of custodians whose files are 
in the ESI pool reduces the need to process and review data from their 
laptops, handheld devices, workstations, network directories, and e-mail 
accounts. But when users share equipment or have access to each 

157
 Chapter 9: Processing, Filtering, and Reviewing ESI
other’s accounts, to name just two scenarios, the ability to distinguish 
whose ESI to filter in or filter out weakens.
	
✓	Date range filtering: Distinguishing files based on date may or may not 
be straightforward. A file has several dates and not all of them are accu­
rate. An e-mail thread can also have many different dates. 
	
Figure 9-4: 
File types to 
be filtered 
from the 
pool of

ESI.
	
Keyword or phrase searching
Keyword or phrase searching is the process of identifying ESI based on spe­
cific keywords or terms in order to find documents for attorney review. 
Keyword searches scrape only the surface of what might be relevant, and 
cannot guarantee that you found everything. That is, the ESI the search iden­
tifies are relevant, but the results are not complete. 
Words that are misspelled, abbreviated words, slang, typos, and the like 
don’t make the cut because searches are so exact. Even the auto-correct 
feature can change a word to something unintended. To relax the precision 
constraint, use software that supports a fuzzy search that looks for common 
misspellings or guesses at whether the word is what you want.
	
If you miss relevant ESI and the opposing counsel challenges you, the judge 
may have doubts regarding what else you might have missed.
Deduping
Deduping decisions might seem easy. If a file is a duplicate, put it into the 
discards. Some decisions about the deduping process are not clear and can 
become overwhelming. Deduplication can be done within each custodian’s 
ESI or within a single ESI repository. Or the process can be applied across all 
custodians of each department or all ESI sources of a department. 
	
Tag duplicates and near-duplicates to inspect closely later on.

158
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
Concept searching
Concept searching software uses the meaning of words or terms to find 
responsive documents. They don’t just match letters or words; they use 
something similar to a thesaurus. A thesaurus finds synonyms, or words with 
similar meaning; hence, it’s a concept finder. Concept searching also looks 
for categories or examples. For example, the word automobile is one category 
in the broader category of vehicles; it’s also a broader category to sedans, 
convertibles, and so on.
Concept searching may also be capable of finding things that are related, but 
not necessarily in categories. 
Heeding the Grimm roadmap
In his 43-page opinion in Victor Stanley, Inc. v. Creative Pipe, Inc. (2008), Judge 
Paul Grimm put fear into the hearts of attorneys who might have attempted 
to structure their own keyword searches for e-discovery.
Judge Grimm made it clear that in order to have a keyword search acceptable 
for the court, one of the following two approaches need to be taken:
	
✓	Collaborative search: You need to confer with your opposing party in 
an effort to identify a mutually agreeable search-and-retrieval method. If 
the method is approved and you follow it, you can avoid disputes over 
the sufficiency of the method. Obviously, doing the search right the first 
time is always faster and cheaper than doing it again on an order from 
the court.
	
✓	Best practices and data-driven search: In order to have a defensible 
methodology in the absence of collaboration, you need to:
 
• Stay current: Know the current strengths and weaknesses of 
various methodologies, including The Sedona Conference Best 
Practices. Arm yourself with the knowledge to select the method 
that’s most appropriate for its intended task.
 
• Prepare your defense: If your selection method is challenged, then 
expect to support your position with affidavits or the equivalent 
from qualified experts that reliable principles or methodology was 
used.
 
• Be capable of rapid course correction: Use appropriate data sam­
pling, trial and error, and quality assurance to test your methods 
and core search assumptions.

159
 Chapter 9: Processing, Filtering, and Reviewing ESI
Sampling to Validate
Sampling is a systematic approach to learn about a population. Sampling is a 
test or an audit. You take small samples of the population to study and learn 
from. 
Given the huge population of preserved ESI, sampling is typically necessary 
in e-discovery. For large cases, consider it mandatory. People would rather 
have nothing to do with sampling because of its association with probability 
and statistics. Let’s face it: Las Vegas is proof that people don’t understand 
or have a healthy respect for probability.
Testing the validity of the search
How do you know that you did a reasonable job? The short answer is that 
you don’t unless you used a systematic process.
The courts have made it crystal clear that a black box approach — a method 
that no one can verify — won’t work. Figure 9-5 illustrates such an approach.

Unfiltered ESI
You might have to validate your search methodology or show that your 
methods retrieved all the ESI they were supposed to retrieve. You must show 
how your methods work and that they actually did work. The best way to do 
the latter is through sampling. 
Follow these steps when taking a sampling of your results:
	
1.	Take a statistically significant number of files.
	
	 The size of the sample depends on the population, or the total number 
of files, as well as several other mind-numbing factors beyond the scope 
of this chapter.

160
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
	
2.	Review the files manually for the ESI that you want it to identify or 
target to learn what the results should be.
	
3.	Use your automated search methodology to perform the same search 
that you did manually.
	
4.	Compare the manual results to the automated results.
	
5.	Draw a conclusion.
	
	 If an acceptable percent of the target ESI detected in the manual search 
appears in the automated search results, the sample validates your 
search methodology. If the automated search did a terrible job of detect­
ing target ESI, use trial and error to improve it.
Validating a methodology is tough because you have to be certain that your 
sample size is sufficient for the test. Luckily, e-discovery production doesn’t 
require statistical certainty and confidence levels. By using trial and error 
with sample sizes and results, you have sufficiently defensible production. 
As Judges Facciola and Grimm pointed out, perfection has never been the 
standard of discovery production; Rule 702 sets standards for testimony by 
experts are in place to make the process rational, not perfect.
A legal hedge against imperfection in sampling is the clawback provision, 
which you read about in Chapter 10.
Documenting sampling efforts
No one is going to accept “trust us” as a response if your sampling and 
search methodologies are challenged. Keep the following in a running 
journal:
	
✓	Minutes of meetings discussing or determining sampling techniques and 
search terms
	
✓	Logs of trial-and-error testing
	
✓	List of key words and terms, dates, file extensions, and custodians that 
you used
	
✓	Reports on the results of trial-and-error testing
	
✓	Invoices or logs of the time and costs involved in sampling efforts
You want to be transparent and be able to explain exactly what you find 
and why.

161
 Chapter 9: Processing, Filtering, and Reviewing ESI
Doing the Review
Your team of lawyers and paralegals review all the processed and filtered ESI.
As you’re processing the ESI, use the following tags for a first-pass review:
	
✓	Responsive: ESI that matches the desired set of criteria for the case or 
that’s selected by one or more of the filters.
	
✓	Irrelevant: ESI that’s not important or pertinent to the dispute.
	
✓	Privilege: Documents that you’re not required to provide because 
they’re protected against disclosure by attorney-client privilege.
	
✓	Private: Personal content, but may be discoverable.
	
✓	Work product: Written notes, reports on conversations with you or wit­
nesses, research, and confidential materials that your attorney develops 
while representing you. Work product is not discoverable.
	
✓	Redact: Text to be removed or obscured from a document so that the 
redacted parts remain confidential and protected. Files whose content 
include content that must be produced as well as privileged or confiden­
tial content need to be redacted to remove what’s privileged.
	
✓	Corrupt: Files that have been damaged and cannot be opened.
	
✓	Encrypted: Files whose contents are disguised and that can’t be read 
until they’re decrypted using the cipher key.
	
✓	Password protected: Files that require a password to open.
	
✓	Hot: Slang for documents, e-mail, text messages, or the like that contain 
relevant content that may impact the outcome of the case. Also referred 
to as smoking gun documents or e-mails.
	
✓	For further review: Files that need further attention.
If the case proceeds, you can continue to refine the ESI pool for second and 
third-pass reviews.
Choosing a review platform
You input all the ESI and their information, including their tags, into a review 
database. The review database might be an in-house application, your 
e-discovery vendor’s software, or a third-party-hosted solution. That data­
base might be hosted on an Internet-accessible platform. If the hard drives 
were imaged (preserved) using computer forensics software, that software’s 
database review capabilities are typically used (see Chapter 13). The trend is 
toward using a Web-based review platform.

162
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
An Internet-accessible platform is essential if your reviewers are geo­
graphically dispersed or even in different time zones. To accommodate and 
increase convenience, vendors and consulting firms may offer Internet-based 
review platforms, a service known as cloud computing. Many of the Internet 
features that support business operations are customized to support litiga­
tion and the review process. 
Here are some of the litigation support software products and models:
	
✓	Cloud computing: This model is based on the utility model. You don’t 
own electricity-generating equipment (or water or gas). You pay for 
usage. With cloud computing, users access services via the Internet 
without owning the IT infrastructure that supports the services. 
	
✓	Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): Basically, SaaS is a rent-a-service. It’s also 
referred to as hosted applications. Many ESI review software packages 
require huge up-front capital investments for licensing fees, user fees, 
and training. With SaaS, you rent capabilities when you need them; that 
is, you get delivery of the services you need on demand. These services 
are like movies-on-demand and video-on-demand.
	
	Pricing is per page or per gigabyte for data processing, plus a hosting 
fee and subscriptions are another option. The SaaS model has several 
benefits, including scalability to the size of your case, 24 hours a day 
and seven days a week support from the vendor (pass the headache 
of IT maintenance to the vendor), and around-the-clock availability to 
reviewers via the Internet. One complaint leveled against this model is 
security, but, then, lawyers used to avoid using e-mail to communicate 
with clients for that same reason. 
	
✓	Dashboards: In e-discovery, dashboards are information portals that 
provide the litigation team with real-time actionable information to help. 
These can be used to track status, timelines, percent completion, and 
estimate the cost of e-discovery activities, for just a few examples.
	
✓	Drilldown: When you want to drill down to get the details, being able 
to simply click for the details saves a lot of time. Drilldown capabilities 
are part of every business executive’s arsenal and now are available for 
e-discovery. For example, summary metrics are linked to their detailed 
components. When a summary metric is clicked, it displays details 
about the review or reviewer.
	
Be sure to train everyone who is tagging ESI. Despite what anyone says, the 
software is not intuitive.

163
 Chapter 9: Processing, Filtering, and Reviewing ESI
How to perform a review
Human review is not necessary for all documents, e-mails, and other ESI 
because it’s fallible and it’s impossible. You are not going to get perfection 
and, if you want perfection, you’re not going to get done with the review. Hot 
documents (those most likely to contain relevant ESI or privileged content) 
warrant the effort of human review.
Consensus is that review is the most expensive e-discovery process. By this 
time, you’ve reduced the volume of ESI using sampling, filters, deduping 
processes, and any other appropriate tool. The actual content of the now-
current pool of responsive ESI needs to be understood somehow. What 
does the e-evidence reveal, expose, or support? You need this information 
about the strengths and weaknesses of your position when your lawyer 
walks into the meet-and-confer session.
Issues to consider when performing a review are
	
✓	Preserve the link or relationship between documents or e-mail mes­
sages and their attachments. Most databases provide a utility to protect 
against separation.
	
✓	Link duplicate files. All files need to be tagged consistently.
	
✓	Preserve metadata by maintaining native file formats. Even if you 
don’t plan to hand the ESI to your opponent in its native format.
	
✓	Verify that tagging and redaction are consistent before preparing the 
ESI for disclosure. You want to redact trade secrets if the rest was rel­
evant. It could also be ordered as part of a motion to produce or protec­
tive order. You read more about redacting in Chapter 11.

▶	Asking for protection (or forgiveness)
▶	Steering clear of waivers
▶	Making agreements that protect ESI
A
ny game you play comes with established rules you need to follow and 
penalties you incur for breaking them. When litigation triggers, you’re 
in a high-stakes game involving charges, pleas, evidence, and so on. This 
game has rules that govern evidence discovery, and breaking these rules 
(intentionally or not) can have serious consequences for the outcome of your 
case. Consider e-discovery the Super Bowl of discovery where the plays you 
run are controlled by Federal Rules of Civil Procedures (FRCP) and Federal 
Rules of Evidence (FRE), and are refereed by the courts. 
	
In state cases, state rules apply and may vary from the federal rules. Because 
the general concepts involved apply to both state and federal rules, we focus 
the chapter discussion on federal rules.
The amount of information that’s stored electronically (ESI) is staggering, but 
not all this ESI is eligible for discovery. The rules governing discovery of ESI 
are devised to protect certain types of communication from disclosure. In 
this chapter, you find out what ESI is protected from e-discovery because of 
privilege (communication considered confidential, such as doctor/patient), 
privacy (trade secrets and the like), or work product (materials prepared in 
the preparation of the case). You also discover how to assert that certain ESI 
deserves protection and how to protect ESI if inadvertent disclosure occurs.

Facing the Rising Tide of 
Electronic Information
Just envision the explosion in the number of servers and hard drives of 
handhelds that retain a copy of e-mail messages that have been copied and 
forwarded. There’s no indication that the exponential growth of business and 
personal text messaging (via iPhones, BlackBerrys, and social networks) is 
abating. These venues exchange more e-mail messages in one day than the 
U.S. Postal Service handles mail in a year.
Because of this digital deluge, you may often have hundreds of thousands 
of documents that you must review for potential confidential information or 
privileged communication. Therefore, the cost of e-discovery and, with it, the 
cost and other burdens associated with filtering protected or privileged ESI, 
has escalated.

In Rowe Entertainment v. Williams Morris et al., the estimated costs of filtering 
through ESI for two of the multiple defendants would conservatively be over 
$370,000 and take upward of two years to complete. The ESI included hun­
dreds of thousands of documents.
Imagine having 200,000 documents stacked in front of you and trying to 
find two documents that may be confidential or privileged. This needle-in-
the-haystack scenario is a common occurrence, and the haystack is getting 
bigger. On television, cases get finished up within an hour — unless the show 
is a miniseries; then it may take as long as four hours. The reality is that the 
e-discovery process can take years.
Respecting the Rules of 
the e-Discovery Game
Certain sections of the FRE and FRCP serve as the rulebook for the e-discovery 
game. Therefore, knowing how the rules are evaluated and applied is essential 
for managing the e-discovery process. Additionally, these sections help you 
identify whether ESI deserves protection because of privilege, privacy, or 
work product.

167
 Chapter 10: Protecting Privilege, Privacy, and Work Product
Targeting relevant information
FRE 401 defines relevant evidence as evidence that goes to prove the exis­
tence of any fact that helps prove or disprove a fact of importance to the 
outcome of the case. Only relevant evidence is admitted into court. You 
might think that this rule helps limit ESI targeted for discovery, but e-discovery 
may encompass a body of ESI that’s much broader than what is considered 
relevant evidence.
	
You can discover ESI that might not be admissible at trial if the ESI could 
reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Therefore, when 
planning for e-discovery, allow for the possibility that the amount of infor­
mation discovered will be much larger than the amount that’s admissible 
evidence in court.
Conversely, relevant evidence may not be discoverable. For example, ESI 
that is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost may be 
protected from e-discovery. However, for a good cause (such as the ESI 
requested is important to the case and cannot be obtained through any other 
means), a court may order its discovery.
Generally, e-discovery may be limited when any of three conditions are met:
	
✓	You can obtain the ESI from other lower-cost sources. For example, a 
request for voluminous financial records that might otherwise be avail­
able in summary form in documents filed with the SEC or other govern­
ment agencies and available to the public.
	
✓	The ESI is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative. For example, when 
a fact has already been disclosed, obtaining thousands of e-mails that 
indicate the same fact is unnecessary and duplicative.
	
✓	Your burden or cost of the e-discovery outweighs the usefulness of 
the information discovered to sufficiently prove something important 
to the trial (in legal terms, this is the information’s probative value). 
This situation might occur when a party requests all the e-mails of all 
the employees of a large company, even those e-mails unrelated to the 
litigation issues. The cost of production far outweighs what may be dis­
covered by looking at every employee’s e-mail. The same may be said if 
the cost of production, even if it’s probative, far outweighs the amount 
in controversy. It makes no sense to force production costs that exceed 
the amount in controversy.
When determining which ESI is discoverable, courts assess the amount of 
information in controversy in the case, the importance of the discovery to 
the issues of the case, and the resources of the parties involved to avoid 
undue burden.

Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
Seeing where relevance and 
privilege intersect
Confidential communication and information differs from what is legally con­
sidered privileged communication. Privileged communications have signifi­
cantly more protection under the federal rules (FRE 501 and FRCP 26 and 45) 
than do confidential communications or information. In either case, certain 
information and communications may be subject to some protection from 
e-discovery but only when the information is not relevant to the case (see the 
preceding section).
Trusting that your communications are confidential can only go so far when 
litigation starts. Only communications legally recognized as privileged com­
munications are not subject to e-discovery.
	
You don’t have to disclose privileged communication even if it’s relevant to 
the issue in the case.
Determining which communications are privileged
A communications privilege is meant to protect certain relationships as 
developed under common law. FRE 501 allows the courts to apply common 
law and reason in establishing privileges. This means that courts may differ 
in what they consider privileged information. Although state rules may differ 
from federal rules, generally privileges apply to communications in these 
types of relationships:
	
✓	Attorney-Client: If you talk to your attorney about a legal matter, you 
should be able to expect that the conversation is confidential and not be 
used against you. If these discussions were allowed to be used in court, 
it would hinder the ability of attorneys to prepare cases with clients who 
were afraid or reluctant to be candid. The wheels of justice would get 
jammed. 
	
	To be covered by attorney-client privilege, the communication must 
have been made in confidence and not further a crime or fraud.
	
✓	Physician/Psychotherapist-Client: Communications with a doctor that 
relate to diagnosis or treatment of a physical, mental, or emotional con­
dition are covered by the privilege.
	
✓	Husband-Wife: Communications that were intended to be confidential 
and made during the marriage are considered part of the sanctity of 
marriage and have a privilege.
	
✓	Religious Leader–Follower: If you communicate in confidence to a cler­
gyman, that communication is protected by privilege. Confidence, for 
this purpose, means that the communication was made privately and 
was not intended to be told to anyone else.

169
 Chapter 10: Protecting Privilege, Privacy, and Work Product
	
✓	Accountant-Client: Some states recognize this privilege as similar to the 
attorney-client privilege. However, the federal government recognizes 
it only in a very narrow privilege — in IRS matters, a situation almost 
never available in third-party actions.
	
✓	Self-Incrimination: The Fifth Amendment provides a privilege against 
self-incrimination if you have a reasonable apprehension that an answer 
might tend to incriminate you. It must be of a criminal act. It applies only 
to testimonial evidence. Generally, the privilege doesn’t apply to busi­
ness entities to the same degree as individuals.
Covering work product with protection
The United States Supreme Court in Hickman v. Taylor recognized that cer­
tain trial preparation materials should be protected under the work product 
(trial preparation materials) doctrine. These are materials that reveal your 
attorney’s strategy and may include evaluations of your case’s strength or 
weakness, reflections from interviews of witnesses, tactics, or similar infor­
mation. Imagine getting a copy of the opposition’s game plan while preparing 
for the Super Bowl.
Work product is not privileged within the meaning of the FRE, but it is safe­
guarded by FRCP 26(b)(3) and FRCP 45(d)(2), which grants protection to 
documents and tangible things that meet two criteria:
	
✓	They’re prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.
	
✓	They’re created by or for a party or its representative.
Even work product protection is limited. Work product may still be subject to 
e-discovery if two conditions are met:
	
✓	The material is otherwise discoverable under the FRCP or FRE.
	
✓	Your opponent shows a substantial need for the materials to prepare 
his case, and you can’t obtain the material by alternate means without 
undue hardship. This means that the information sought is essential to 
your opponent and crucial to the case.
	
Even if required by the court to disclose work product, be sure to disclose 
only those materials that contain facts related to the case. Courts generally 
don’t require you to disclose the attorney thought process. This ESI generally 
remains protected. ESI containing thought process, legal theories, or opinions 
of your attorney or other representative should not be disclosed unless by 
specific order of the court.
Similar to the work product protection is the protection afforded government 
agencies in the deliberative process (the process of forming governmental 
decisions and policies). Documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommen­
dations, and deliberations in this process are protected.

170
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
Here is how you invoke the court’s protection against e-discovery successfully:
	
1.	Verify that the ESI is a trade secret or proprietary research.
	
	 You do this by
 
• Determining the value of the ESI both to the company and in the 
market (that is, internally and externally).
 
• Evaluating how easy it would be for someone to duplicate your 
trade secret or proprietary research.
 
• Estimating the amount of time and effort that you spent in 
development.
 
• Identifying the level of disclosure within your business and the 
measures taken to protect the information.
	
2.	Assert that the ESI is a trade secret or proprietary research.
	
	 You do this by proving that
 
• The information has separate economic value.
 
• You have made an effort to maintain its secrecy.
Managing e-discovery of confidential 
information
While you’re involved in litigation, you may get a hold of some nonprivileged ESI 
that’s relevant to the other party’s claim or defense. The court can order you — 
or even a third party — to disclose relevant evidence. In the words of Anna (to 
the King) in The King and I: Getting to know you, getting to know all about you.
When you’re managing the disclosure (or not) of information through 
e-discovery, you can do the following:
	
✓	Request ESI for information from the other party (under FRCP 26), or 
from third parties through a subpoena (under FRCP 45). For example, 
if a third-party vendor (such as Yahoo! or AOL) maintains e-mails or 
other records on its server, you can subpoena those e-mails or other ESI 
for use in the litigation. 
	
	Third parties can’t object to discovery of ESI based on confidentiality, 
privilege, or work product protection of another party, but could object 
on their own behalf. The party whose protection or privilege may be vio­
lated must make the claim of privilege to the court. Although the third 
party could seek to avoid disclosure on other grounds, such as not rea­
sonably accessible or undue cost or burden. 
	
✓	Don’t disclose ESI that’s protected under federal rules (which means it 
isn’t subject to e-discovery). Parties in a lawsuit can ask for any informa­
tion, but it doesn’t mean they’ll get it! 

171
 Chapter 10: Protecting Privilege, Privacy, and Work Product
	
	You can protect confidential information through an order of protection, 
issued by the court under FRCP 26, which relieves you of the duty to dis­
close. (We discuss this further in the section, “Getting or Avoiding a 
Waiver,” later in this chapter.) Commonly protected types of confiden­
tial ESI include
	
• Trade secrets, for example, the secret formula for Coca-Cola.
	
• Proprietary research, which includes research on a new product or 
improvement.
	
• Other valuable proprietary information that is meant to remain pri­
vate, such as corporate strategic plans for an expansion. It might 
also include ESI such as personally identifiable information (PII) 
that not only identifies a person but can be used to trace a person, 
such as name. address, birth date, and Social Security Number.
Privilege, protection, and e-discovery complications
A plaintiff brings an action for divorce alleging 
infidelity on behalf of the defendant spouse. 
Further, the plaintiff seeks custody of the two 
children born of the marriage alleging the 
defendant is an unfit parent. To attempt to 
prove infidelity, the plaintiff’s attorney makes 
a demand for all e-mails, cellphone and texting 
records, and a mirror of the hard drive on both 
the company computer and laptop of the defen­
dant. This action is in state court.
In addition to the divorce, the defendant’s com­
pany (owned by the defendant) is involved in a 
patent infringement suit. This matter is in fed­
eral court.
E-mails and text messages involve communi­
cations between the defendant and the defen­
dant’s attorney in both matters. They discuss 
strategies in the divorce and potential settle­
ment offers in the patent infringement case. 
Privileged communications.
The hard drives contain copies of correspon­
dence with the attorney as well as spread­
sheets prepared for the attorney in the patent 
infringement suit. In addition, the hard drive 
at the office contains information on pending 
merger negotiations with another company. 
There is also confidential research data on new 
product development unrelated to the patent 
case. Both confidential and work product ESI. 
Probably not relevant to the divorce.
Further, there is correspondence between the 
defendant and the defendant’s psychiatrist 
concerning emotional problems the defendant 
has been experiencing. It includes a diary that 
the defendant writes in each day and then takes 
to the psychiatrist as part of this therapy. Most 
of the entries relate to his relationship with the 
plaintiff spouse and the children. Physician-
patient privilege.
A first pass review indicates at least 20,000 
e-mails and 140,000 other documents that 
may show initial relevance. A review of the 
facts indicates that there is probably privi­
leged, work product, and confidential ESI in the 
e-discovery request. The complexity of issues 
and two separate trials — one in state court 
and one in federal court — multiplies the diffi­
culty and expense of e-discovery. See Chapter 
9 for a look at the role of the IT professional 
in helping to determine the protocol to use to 
filter for privileged communications, confiden­
tial material, and work product.

172
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
Listening to the Masters
Judges can use Special Masters under FRCP 53 to handle ESI-related disputes, 
and you can request that the court appoint one. A Special Master can help 
cut costs by:
	
✓	Facilitating the e-discovery process: Special Masters work with both 
you and your opponent to resolve such issues as relevance and privilege 
protection. 
	
✓	Monitoring compliance: The Special Master can watch over the process 
to assure everyone complies with discover and maintain appropriate 
timetables. 
	
✓	Assisting in technical disputes: For example, a technical dispute might 
involve the form in which the ESI is to be produced. A Special Master 
would work with you to determine the most cost-effective form of 
production.
	
✓	Adjudicating legal disputes related to ESI: In the case of a legal dispute 
regarding work product protection, the Special Master can determine 
the scope of the information to be protected.
	
✓	Assist in developing preservation protocols: Special Masters work with 
you to develop appropriate protocols as discussed in Chapter 9.
	
✓	Work with the parties to establish e-discovery agreements: Special 
Masters can assist you in developing the terms of an agreement to pro­
tect from privilege waivers. See the upcoming section, “Leveling the 
Playing Field through Agreement.”
Getting or Avoiding a Waiver
An intentional disclosure of ESI serves as a waiver of any confidentiality, 
privilege, or work product protection. And if the privilege or protection is 
waived, the waiver generally applies to all other ESI concerning the same sub­
ject matter. So, it’s (logically) a subject matter waiver.
	
You do have some say on a subject matter waiver. If the sheer volume of ESI 
involved under a subject matter waiver would impose costs for review and fil­
tering that are disproportionate to what is at stake in the litigation, the courts 
could limit the scope of the waiver. Rule 502(a) of the FRE limits a waiver to 
the communication or materials disclosed and not to the entire subject matter 
of the communication. The court may expand the waiver beyond Rule 502 if it 
deems the expansion appropriate.

173
 Chapter 10: Protecting Privilege, Privacy, and Work Product
But with the expediential growth of e-discovery and technology, filtering all 
the ESI before making the appropriate protection claims becomes increas­
ingly more difficult. Not only are the costs and delays apparent, but the pos­
sibility of inadvertent disclosure can seem virtually inevitable — like death 
and taxes.
Asserting a claim
You have various options related to avoiding or limiting a waiver. You can
	
✓	Assert confidentiality: Your attorney may claim that certain ESI is not 
relevant or may request (with a motion) a protective order under FRCP 
26(c)(1). She must accompany the motion with a certification that 
you’ve conferred in good faith or made a good faith attempted to confer 
with the other parties to resolve an issue. (Conferring includes the meet-
and-confer session that we discuss in Chapter 6.)
	
	The court can issue the protective order for good cause to protect 
against annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or 
expense. Undue burden — in the case of a trade secret — could include 
serious injury to your business or putting your business at a competitive 
disadvantage.
	
✓	Assert privilege or work product protection: You don’t use a protective 
order to assert privilege or work product (trial preparation materials) 
protection as a reason for withholding information. Instead, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Expressly set forth the claim of privilege being asserted. 
	
	Translating from legalese, you have to tell the requesting party 
that you’re claiming privilege.
	
2.	Provide information about the nature of the ESI withheld to the 
requesting party to enable them to analyze your assertion. 
	
	That means you tell the other side what it is that you’re not giving 
them.
Preparing a privilege log
Privilege logs list the ESI that you’re withholding as privileged or protected. 
Figure 10-1 shows one of the many privilege logs that Dow Chemical sub­
mitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). CREW (Citizens for 
Responsibility and Ethics in Washington) made the request for those docu­
ments under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

When developing a privilege log, record the following items:
	
✓	Document number: Remember to number the documents sequentially.
	
✓	Type of document or information withheld: For example, identify the 
document as an e-mail, memo, and so on.
	
✓	Names of parties: Who’s involved in the communication.
	
✓	Date and time: When the document was prepared.
	
✓	Privilege or protection claimed: Such as whether it’s attorney-client 
privilege, or work product protection.
	
✓	Description or summary of contents: Allows your opponent to deter­
mine whether a privilege or protection exists.
The court could allow you to prepare the log on a category basis if the 
amount of material is too voluminous. 

175
 Chapter 10: Protecting Privilege, Privacy, and Work Product
Responding to ESI disclosure
Disclosure of ESI doesn’t automatically eliminate the claim of privilege or 
protection. Notify the recipient of the ESI about your claim. When you do, the 
recipient must
	
✓	Promptly return, sequester, or destroy the ESI. They may not disclose 
it until your claim is resolved.
	
✓	Retrieve the ESI. If the recipient disseminated the ESI to others before 
you notified them of your claim, they must take reasonable steps to 
recover the ESI.
	
✓	Turn over ESI to the court. The recipient may also send the ESI to the 
court to be held under seal until the claim is determined. While you are 
asserting the claim, you must keep the ESI secure until resolution of the 
matter, which may be many years later.
	
Some courts have held that if your attorney knows or has reason to know that 
protected or privileged ESI was inadvertently disclosed, he has a legal and 
ethical duty to notify the responding party and take action. 
If your opponent objects to your assertion of privilege or protection, the 
court may review the ESI or a portion of it (called in camera review) to deter­
mine whether the ESI should be protected from discovery.
Applying FRE 502 to disclosure
In federal courts, inadvertent disclosure of ESI protected under the attorney-
client privilege or work product protection can’t be deemed a waiver. FRE 
502 is one of the federal rules of evidence that the courts use to determine 
what evidence will be admitted into court. Rule 502 covers the attorney-client 
privilege and work product protection. Also, intentional disclosure in a fed­
eral case or to a federal office or agency (for example, the IRS or SEC) waives 
the privilege or protection only for the ESI disclosed. It is not a subject 
matter waiver. 
	
If the intentional disclosure is meant to mislead or is put forth in an unfair 
manner, it will be considered a subject matter waiver and applies to all 
related ESI.
Many states use the federal rules as a guide, but they vary on the waiver rules. 
State rules generally conform to the approaches presented in Table 10-1.

176
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
Table 10-1	
State Approaches to Waivers
Approach
What It Means
Lenient
An inadvertent disclosure is never considered a waiver.
Middle of 
the road
If you used reasonable care to identify attorney-client privileged 
or work product protected ESI, then an inadvertent disclosure 
doesn’t constitute a waiver. Most states follow this rule, which is 
also the basis of FRE 502.
Strict
Disclosure is a waiver. No further discussion is necessary.
	
You must take great care not to waive other privileges or protections that 
you can secure by party agreements, such as quick-peek, attorney-eyes-only, 
or clawback agreements. (See the section “Leveling the Playing Field through 
Agreement,” later in this chapter.) After the ESI is out there — whether disclo­
sure is inadvertent or intentional — it is already disclosed. Suppose that the 
ESI is a memo from in-house counsel to outside (or out-house?) counsel dis­
cussing a possible settlement figure. Clawback, quick-peek, attorney-eyes-only, 
waiver, no waiver — the form of protection doesn’t matter. You really can’t 
take back what the other side has learned about your case.
Check out Table 10-2 for a rundown of disclosures and related waivers under 
various circumstances.

Metadata
Possible waiver
In some states, an attorney who 
allows disclosure of metadata 
containing information for which a 
privilege or protection is claimed 
has probably committed malpractice.
	
FRE 502 treats an inadvertent disclosure as a clawback agreement (see the 
next section).
	
Establishing and implementing a protocol to identify and filter privileged, con­
fidential, and protected work product before the litigation is the best defense. 
See Chapter 9 for how-to information.
Leveling the Playing Field 
through Agreement
You can take additional steps to protect against unintentional disclosure. FRE 
502 provides relief for inadvertent disclosure of items privileged under the 
attorney-client privilege or protected as work product. But you must manage 
other claimed privilege or waiver by party agreements.
All parties involved in litigation benefit from reduced costs and timely 
e-discovery. Therefore, facilitating the e-discovery process with agreements 
can help promote savings of both time and money. In the meet-and-confer 
session, you should try to determine the extent of e-discovery, any privileges 
or other protection that the other party claims, and methods of reducing the 
possible extraordinary costs that come from producing and protecting ESI. 
Checking out the types of agreements
You can produce agreements on a number of common e-discovery solutions 
that help protect against waiver. 
Here are some common types:
	
✓	Quick-peek agreements allow you to take a quick peek at your oppo­
nent’s ESI based on an agreed filtering protocol. A quick peek is not a 
waiver of privileged or protection.

178
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
	
	After this quick initial review, you specify the ESI you want. Filtering 
only the specified documents for privilege, confidentiality, or protected 
work product saves your opponent time and effort.
	
✓	Attorney-eyes-only agreements save time and expense by stating that 
the material requested is reviewed by your attorney only. Any review 
of confidential, privileged, or protected information is not deemed a 
waiver, and your opponent can still assert privilege or protection later.
	
✓	Clawback agreements provide that you may take back any ESI that 
you’ve disclosed and later believe is protected or privileged. The claw­
back allows for more liberal and timely e-discovery while still protecting 
the ability to claim privilege, confidentially, or work product protection. 
Clawback agreements should contain express language on the following:
 
• Inadvertent disclosure or production of ESI that is protected by 
privileged or work product protection (could also be expanded to 
include confidential information) doesn’t constitute a waiver and 
can’t be admitted into evidence in court.
 
• Upon request, you return the privileged or protected ESI and any 
copies expeditiously.
 
• If you receive privileged or protected ESI, you must notify your 
opponent and return it in a timely manner.
 
• You must provide the names of all persons who have had access to 
the privileged or protected ESI and take reasonable steps to secure 
the return of any privileged or protected ESI it may have dissemi­
nated to third parties.
 
• If this agreement becomes a subject of litigation, the successful 
party will be entitled to costs and attorney fees incurred to 
enforce it.
	
	When you assert the claim, your opponent should return the ESI. If your 
opponent challenges the assertion, she may sequester or deposit the ESI 
with the court until a resolution of the dispute.
Shoring up your agreements by court order
You should try to incorporate every agreement into a court order. An agree­
ment alone may not extend the waiver protection to other actions or sub­
sequent litigation, especially for state court litigation. Generally, any ESI 
disclosed by court order is not deemed a waiver in other matters because 
the disclosure isn’t voluntary.

179
 Chapter 10: Protecting Privilege, Privacy, and Work Product
Agreements may also be incorporated into various court orders, including:
	
✓	Scheduling orders under FRCP 16, in which, after receiving a report 
from your meet-and-confer session or consultation with the attorneys, 
the court enters an order managing the time frames of the case, discov­
ery, and an agreement relating to asserting privilege or protection.
	
✓	Protective orders under FRCP 26(c), where the court may protect you 
from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden by for­
bidding or limiting discovery. 
	
✓	Discovery management orders under FRCP 26(b)(2), in this case, the 
court may alter the extent of discovery.
	
If the agreement is made part of a discovery management order under FRCP 
26(b)(2), you can later assert that the disclosure was not voluntary and was 
pursuant to an order of the court. To make this assertion avoids the future 
privilege or protection arguments. If you don’t incorporate your agreements in 
a court order, they’re merely contractual in nature.

Responsive ESI
In This Chapter
▶	Dealing from the top of the data deck
▶	Redacting information properly
▶	Deciding how to handle metadata
▶	Keeping the links of the custody chain tight
E
lectronic discovery may seem like it’s just about producing documents 
to the other side. But its purpose is to allow your lawyer to obtain the 
factual information that he needs to prepare a case for trial, or maybe even 
negotiate a settlement.
In this chapter, you find out about the final e-discovery stage to achieve a 
production or release that’s relatively smooth and efficient. Disputes will 
arise if agreements aren’t met or if the other party believes your production 
is insufficient — especially if you don’t produce metadata or privilege logs 
that identify ESI that you excluded because it was privileged. We also tell you 
about the final work to be done, such as redacting work-product information, 
and work to be produced, including the chain of custody.
	
The actual production is done by one of three parties: a third-party litigation 
services provider, outside counsel’s litigation support department, or your 
in-house litigation support team. But this chapter is useful to you because you 
need to hand over all the ESI in the manner your lawyer needs it.

182
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
Producing Data Sets
The production stage, or disclosure, begins with ESI that you’ve preserved 
and processed and that has survived numerous filters and the scrutiny of 
privilege review. Files that include content that must be produced, as well 
as privileged or confidential content, need to be redacted to remove the 
privileged information, as you can read about in the section “Redacting prior 
to disclosure,” later in this chapter.
All ESI that’s non-relevant or protected by a rule or court order is filtered 
out, leaving the responsive ESI data sets that will be produced or released 
to the requesting party. You see the steady reduction in volume in Figure 
11-1 from unwashed to refined and responsive ESI. Figure 11-1 also shows 
that production that’s improperly done forces you to cycle back to prior 
stages for do-overs.
After you produce ESI, the dispute doesn’t end. Judges’ rulings on post-
production motions might also change what you have to produce or the 
format in which you produce the files. You see a lot of activity during this 
stage involving technical, legal, or judicial issues.
	
Do-overs increase costs and anger judges. Follow the e-discovery plan to the 
letter, and you minimize having to do work over.

 Chapter 11: Producing and Releasing Responsive ESI
Packing bytes
In the pre-digital age, production consisted of packing paper documents into 
boxes and delivering them to the requesting party. With e-discovery, you 
have two basic methods of production:
	
✓	Deliver: You deliver the ESI on physical magnetic media, such as CDs, 
DVDs, or portable hard drives. Like with paper, the ESI is packaged and 
sent to the requesting party.
	
✓	Release: You make the ESI available to the responding party. ESI may 
be hosted (stored) on a litigation services platform (a server). Authorized 
users can access the server via a secure Internet connection or a virtual 
private network (VPN, which is an encrypted tunnel for accessing a 
server via the Internet). You give log-in permissions to requesting par­
ties to access your data.
	
	Several of the steps you use to secure and provide access to ESI if you 
use the release method are:
 
• Implement strict information security protocols. You may expect 
that your litigation service provider or host has multiple layers 
of security, but verify that to be sure. Find out if they’ve had any 
incidents, infections, or intrusions. Companies that have been 
victimized by security breaches aren’t eager to report them. 
Consider the nightmare of having your ESI infected by malware, 
spyware, or a hacker. Malicious malware can destroy or corrupt 
files. Even if a virus or hacker doesn’t compromise the integrity 
of the ESI, verifying and proving it would be time-consuming and 
carry a big price tag.
Botched redaction compromises security
The United States military composed a 42-page 
PDF file to publish its report about the 2005 death 
of Nicola Capilari, an Italian agent, and the 
wounding of Italian journalist Guiliana Sgrena. 
Because the U.S. report included sensitive mili­
tary information that could be used by an enemy, 
it was heavily redacted before it was released. 
Unfortunately, those performing the redac­
tion didn’t understand the properties of Adobe 
Acrobat. They used the black highlighter tool, 
which on paper would have left a black mark. 
However, in Adobe Acrobat, black highlights 
can be removed or changed to a pale color, 
which would reveal the contents underneath. 
The report’s redacted classified information was 
revealed. This error could have been avoided if 
commercially available software, such as Redax, 
had been used to redact text from documents 
created by Adobe Acrobat.

184
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
 
• Share secure access. costs for hosting the ESI between you and your 
opponent. You each have secure and separate log-in access to the 
data sets being produced, and the receiving parties can review and 
designate the documents they want and the format in which they 
will receive the documents.
	
	The military’s model of trust, but verify is a good one for you to 
adopt.
 
• Track access and activity in an access log that doesn’t get overwrit­
ten. All networks have logging capabilities that log access and 
activity at the level of detail that you set. The logs are like network 
metadata that you may need if access or release is challenged. For 
example, if your opponent claims that you failed to release content 
that you’d released and that someone on their team had accessed, 
you can prove your opponent’s claims are false. If for some reason, 
access was denied, you’ll know where the problem is.
 
• Track the production history for each file to ensure defensibility. As 
data sets are released, production is logged. You have deadlines 
and schedules to meet. These logs are your verification if timing 
for the release is disputed.
Whether physical delivery or digital release, production timing is done in one 
of two ways.
	
✓	All at once: You pack and produce in one swoop. For cases that involve 
a small volume of ESI, this method makes sense. There may be other rea­
sons related to case strategy to hold off production until the drop-dead 
deadline.
	
✓	Rolling production: You produce batches of ESI according to set sched­
ules. Or if documents are processed in small chunks, these documents 
can be made available as they’re ready. Rolling production can occur 
over a short time or over a year or more. 
Staging production
Rolling productions are done on an agreed-to or negotiated schedule. 
Consider a rolling production when your team has a lot of information that 
they have to review and produce within a short time frame.
Some other considerations to think about with a rolling production are 
	
✓	Use a pilot method to test and debug. A rolling production allows the 
receiver to receive a sample of the production and test it. A pilot test, 
like marketers use to test a new product, gives the opportunity to iden­
tify problems early in the production so they can be fixed so that dead­
lines are met.

185
 Chapter 11: Producing and Releasing Responsive ESI
	
✓	Prioritize the release of your ESI. Not all ESI is of equal value. E-mail 
messages or Excel spreadsheets with financials might be higher priority 
(value) than the minutes of meetings. Requests for critical custodians’ 
data or those whose depositions are scheduled can be processed and 
released first rather than last. Prioritize the order in which ESI will be 
processed and produced on a rolling basis.
	
With rolling production, you must come up with a process to manage the 
review of documents and ensure that everything is rolled out as scheduled. 
With rolling production or production involving many final reviewers, you 
want processes in place for final reviews to ensure the following:
	
✓	Non-repetitive review: It’s possible that reviewers will accidentally 
review the same documents multiple times. Repetitive review can 
cause delays or inconsistent coding, which opens an entirely new can 
of worms. At this stage, the focus is usually meeting schedules or dead­
lines, whatever the cost.
	
✓	Complete review: If you aren’t sure about what’s already been reviewed, 
you also can’t be sure about what hasn’t been reviewed. Make sure you 
don’t miss documents.
	
✓	Non-duplicate review: The first deduping filtering may not have 
detected duplicates, for example, leaving duplicate e-mails from multiple 
custodians. Now is the time to remove the duplicates.
	
If a custodian’s e-mail box and messages must stay intact for an investigation, 
don’t attempt to do anything to it. For example, do not dedupe the mailbox 
because that would violate the order to keep it intact.
Regardless of the method you use, when production is complete, you certify 
your production as complete. In a letter sent by counsel to the opponent, you 
certify that you have produced all information within your possession, cus­
tody, or control related to the claims and defenses in the litigation.
Being alert to native production motions
Situations may arise in which the opposing counsel, after receiving your pro­
duction, determines that the ESI is not searchable, or reasonably searchable. 
For example, a complaint might be that the spreadsheets produced in image 
format don’t provide the information (for example, formulas, metadata, or 
macros) needed to analyze the documents fully. The opposition could make 
a motion to the court that you must produce the spreadsheets in native 
format. You return to the review stage, or more specifically, you roll back to 
the files before processing occurred. (Refer to Figure 11-1.) Then you can pro­
ceed to review and produce the spreadsheets in native format. 

186
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
Make sure your lawyer specifies what production file formats and priorities 
are needed at the meet-and-confer session so you don’t waste your time and 
effort producing evidence that the other party may challenge. If your lawyer 
doesn’t tell you what she and the opposing party agreed to, ask her.
	
If there’s no agreement and no court order specifying the forms of production, 
you can produce the information in the manner you ordinarily maintain it or in 
a reasonably usable form.
Producing reasonably accessible metadata that enables the receiving party 
to access, search, and display the information is mandatory unless your 
lawyer negotiated some sort of Get Out of Jail Free card with the opposing 
counsel or the court. However, don’t agree to something that you think or 
hope you’ll never have to keep.
While agreements between litigants cannot violate the rules, case law, or 
court orders, it’s possible to wipe out protections they provide you at your 
own hand. GeoStar learned this lesson in the In re: Classicstar Mare Lease 
Litigation (2009).
Defendant GeoStar took the position that GeoStar’s original production had 
met and satisfied the legal requirements. (In fact, it did.) GeoStar had pro­
duced its financial documents in PDF and Excel format and also converted its 
documents to TIFF documents with DII load files so that the documents could 
be loaded into the parties’ Summation or Concordance databases, two widely 
used litigation platforms. Concordance and Summation are proprietary legal 
software that allow a firm’s staff to organize case files in an electronic format. 
It’s not uncommon for firms to request either of these formats so that they 
can automatically load them into the database.
Although the plaintiffs did not initially specify the form of production, one 
sought an additional production of the documents in their native format. 
The plaintiff didn’t contest that the documents already had been produced 
in reasonably usable forms, but claimed that review of the documents in 
their native formats would save hundreds of hours in search time. GeoStar 
argued that it had the option to produce documents in their native format or 
in an alternative format that was “reasonably usable” and that did not “sig­
nificantly degrade” the searchability function of the documents. They cited a 
decision in United States v. O’Keefe (2008) which held that 
“. . . production of the electronically stored information in PDF or TIFF 
format would suffice, unless defendants can show that those formats are 
not ‘reasonably usable’ and that the native format, with the accompany­
ing metadata, meet the criteria of ‘reasonably usable’ whereas the PDF or 
TIFF formats do not.”
The exchange that took place between counsel for the West Hills plaintiffs 
and counsel for GeoStar Corporation reads as follows.

187
 Chapter 11: Producing and Releasing Responsive ESI
“This letter responds to your prior letter and emails regarding docu­
ments produced by GeoStar Corporation. You asked that we produce the 
financial and accounting records in their native format. I do not know, 
however, whether you have the software to be used in connection with 
that information. GeoStar runs two software packages for its financial 
records: (1) Creative Solutions; and (2) Oil & Gas Information Systems. 
It is my understanding that the latter program may cost in excess of 
$15,000. Although we could provide you with the data housed in these 
programs, it would be useless without the software in which to import 
that data. We will provide you with the financial records in a format that 
will allow you to upload them into your Summation or Concordance 
database, and we can provide you with the data in its native format if you 
choose to buy the software.”
GeoStar has a bulletproof defense until that final part of the last sentence. 
The court caught that last sentence, where counsel for defendant unwisely 
stated in a letter to plaintiff’s counsel that the documents would be provided 
also in native format if plaintiff chose to buy the $15,000 software needed to 
make native format documents useful. In hindsight, this attempt at humor 
or sarcasm or spirit of cooperation was a mistake. To the court, even if the 
initial production in non-native format met Rule 34 requirements, defendant 
(under no pressure to do so) had agreed to the additional native format pro­
duction. The court compelled the production in native format, but found it 
“only fair to shift the reasonable cost of copying and delivering” the native 
format production to plaintiff because defendant already had produced the 
documents and plaintiff had not specified a native format production.
Redacting prior to disclosure
One of the last tasks to perform or verify before you disclose ESI is redaction — 
taking out anything the opposing party doesn’t deserve to get. Redaction 
sounds simple enough, but it’s tough to specify with electronic content. A file 
may contain privileged information, as well as relevant, nonprivileged, and 
discoverable details. You’re obliged to produce the latter while protecting 
the privilege. 
Electronic redaction is different from standard redaction — the latter 
requires the use of a marker or redaction tape and a lot of hoping for the 
best. Electronic redaction involves completely removing content from an 
electronic document and making it irretrievable and unavailable for viewing, 
printing, searching, or copying.
	
If you redact info without using the proper software, you run the risk of not 
doing the job properly and giving confidential information to the other side. 
Always use a proper redaction software to redact your privileged information.

188
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
Redacting information the wrong way
You want privileged or private content to not be there. Notice the wording. 
Redacting should not be thought of as a cover up. Adobe Acrobat’s PDF files 
and Microsoft Word’s documents are notoriously vulnerable to botched 
redaction. Actually, it’s the naïve individuals at the helm who are responsible 
for such mistakes because they do not know what they’re doing.
In Schaefer v. GE (May 2008), legal counsel for the plaintiff improperly 
redacted documents by simply placing black bars over the text set for dele­
tion. Although a court order mandated that the revealed information be 
sealed, the flawed documents were e-filed and available for download. When 
GE realized that people who read the material covered by the black lines 
could copy and paste the content into Microsoft Word, GE’s attorneys filed 
an unsuccessful motion to dismiss. Plaintiff’s counsel was able to withdraw 
the documents at issue and re-file properly redacted copies. While the error 
won’t materially affect the outcome of the case, the negative press may 
undermine the company’s potential and existing client confidence.
Facebook’s confidential settlement of a lawsuit brought by ConnectU, a social 
site, was revealed when the Associated Press (AP) reported that redacted 
portions of a PDF transcript of a court hearing with details of the settlement 
could be easily revealed. Redaction was done by whiting out portions of the 
PDF. Specifically, white rectangles were placed over the white text in order 
to cover it and make it undiscoverable. When techno-literates copied the 
content of the PDF and pasted it into another document, they removed the 
whited-out overlays, making all contents fully readable. Figure 11-2 shows a 
document with some portions whited out.
	
Figure 11-2:

Another botched redaction was done to a Word document by selecting the 
text and highlighting it in black, as shown in Figure 11-3. Then the file was 
sent via e-mail. The receiver selected the same text, and changed the black 
highlighting to yellow. Not only was the document no longer redacted, but 
the receiving party knew exactly what their opponent didn’t want them to 
know.

Redacting the right way
Redaction software rather than do-it-yourself highlighting is your safest 
approach. A number of redaction software products are available that ensure 
that you don’t make common redaction mistakes. If you have large amounts 
of redaction, you can automate the process using intelligent redactionware. 
Automatic software searches for text strings, just as the search feature in a 
word-processing program does. Another option is intelligent software that 
works on the principle of matching patterns, such as finding all credit card 
or Social Security numbers. Redax is an example of software to redact text 
from documents created by Adobe Acrobat. To prevent redacted text hidden 
in a PDF from becoming discoverable, you can use Adobe Acrobat software’s 
encryption feature to make it impossible for documents to be altered by 
unauthorized persons, while still enabling anyone to view them.
Most redaction software offers the ability to add a reason for redactions or 
comments, such as Private or Highly Privileged. Sometimes the reason is actu­
ally printed on top of the redaction entity. This level of documentation can 
provide a good defense if results are challenged.
Documents have a history
An example of botched document editing 
involved SCO Group. On March 3, 2004, SCO 
filed a breach of contract lawsuit in Michigan 
state court against DaimlerChrysler for violat­
ing the terms of its Unix software agreement 
with SCO. The complaint’s electronic version 
contained its modification (change) history 
revealing the history of SCO’s litigation plans. 
When the change history was examined, it 
revealed that up to February 18, 2004, SCO was 
planning to sue Bank of America in federal 
rather than state court, for copyright infringe­
ment rather than breach of contract!

Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
	
The National Security Agency (NSA) published a document on proper redac­
tion technique in December 2005. You can download the PDF from the agency’s 
Web site at www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/dod/nsa-red. Redactionware 
allows you to process any document type and gives you a range of powerful 
tools to specify what information needs to be redacted. Once the redactions 
are confirmed, the information selected for redaction is completely and perma­
nently removed from the document. The software produces a clean document 
that can’t be reverse engineered back to its original content. 
No-risk redaction of any kind does not exist. Human oversight is still needed 
for several reasons, including the following:
	
✓	Automated redaction cannot identify and, therefore, cannot block a 
search term contained in a scanned image. Text in an embedded image 
is not searchable. 
	
✓	Embedded tables or graphs, or handwriting on scanned documents 
should be manually redacted. Software is not robust enough to trust it 
to detect and redact this information with reasonable reliability. 
	
✓	Legal teams may use optical character recognition (OCR). Redaction 
tools are only as good as the OCR results. For instance, if the OCR soft­
ware incorrectly identified “there” as “where,” the redaction search 
won’t find it unless the software has the capability of fuzzy search.
	
It is the responsibility of your legal counsel to properly redact all documents 
prior to production. Improper redaction creates the risk of inadvertent disclo­
sure that might not be protected for using faulty redaction methods.
Over-redacting carries its own problems. If your results appear to be overly 
redacted or are, in fact, redacted more than needed and the other side chal­
lenges your claims of privilege, a court may second-guess you for the entire 
case, putting it at risk. 
A lawyer who has produced insufficiently redacted information can be in 
violation of various ethical rules and subject to malpractice.
Providing Detailed Documentation
Documentation can be your get-out-of-sanction card when you’re ordered to 
prove you did or didn’t do something. ESI needs documentation, too. Every 
piece of media should be tracked as it moves through the stages of e-discovery 
by each person or company handling it. Here’s what to do:
	
✓	Document the history of document productions, as you read in the 
section, “Packing bytes” in this chapter.
	
✓	Track every piece of media as it moves through e-discovery processes 
by each person, firm, or enterprise handling it.

191
 Chapter 11: Producing and Releasing Responsive ESI
The EDRM (Electronic Discovery Reference Model, www.edrm.net) recom­
mends including the following information in a production history log:
	
✓	Date sent
	
✓	Sent to whom, with full contact information
	
✓	Means by which it was sent, with the shipper’s tracking info
	
✓	Description of media sent, including a copy of the label
	
✓	Identification of the components being produced, including

Magnatrax Litigation Trust, Plaintiff, v. Onex 
Corporation (2009) is a fraud case arising out 
of the 2003 bankruptcy of Magnatrax. The final 
deadline for fact discovery in this matter was 
February 29, 2008. But the parties continued to 
file motions to compel and request protective 
order into the third quarter of 2008. The prolonged 
discovery process spawned four discovery hear­
ings. The process ranged from contentious to 
abusive. The court expressed its displeasure with 
the parties’ behavior several times. 
The plaintiff insisted that the defendants’ redac­
tions were evidence of an intent to hide evi­
dence. In contrast, the defendants contended 
that all their redactions were consistent with 
the court’s December 2007 and March 2008 
orders. The plaintiff referenced one document, 
in redacted and unredacted form, to its motion 
for sanctions. 
But the defendants provided the court with a 
credible excuse for the improper redaction of 
this document. Without more, the court could 
not find that the defendants’ redactions were 
evidence of a willful intent to hide information 
from plaintiff. The court was able to tell from 
the state of the record, however, that the defen­
dants had unnecessarily prolonged the time 
and expense necessary to complete document 
production in this matter. 
The parties had a confidentiality agreement in 
place from which the defendants could have 
sought additional protection from the court. 
They didn’t. Instead, according to the court, the 
defendants improperly relied on the court’s 
December and March orders. The court’s 
March order merely sanctioned the redactions 
the defendants had put before it; it did not give 
them leave to redact other documents. The 
court found that the defendants had absolutely 
no cause to unilaterally redact thousands of 
documents only to be forced to reproduce them 
later.

near-native (for example, a comma-delimited Excel file), and near-paper files 
(for example, an image or TIF of the Excel file) to the Document ID. Various 
load file formats depend on the software application. Some of the common 
load files include .dii (Summation), .lfp (IPRO), and .opt (Concordance/
Opticon).
You can capture the production history log in fields in a database such as 
Access or an Excel spreadsheet. Often, the paralegal maintains and updates 
the production history log.

Showing an Unbroken Chain of Custody
The production history log also is an important link in the chain of custody. 
At the production stage, it’s equally important to maintain that chain as 
during collection and other prior processes. Chain of custody is the process 
by which handlers of the ESI, computer forensics specialists, or other investi­
gators preserve the ESI. The chain of custody is necessary documentation. It 
documents that the e-evidence was handled and preserved properly and was 
never at risk of being compromised. The documentation may need to include
	
✓	Where the ESI was stored
	
✓	Who had access to the ESI
	
✓	What was done to the ESI

193
 Chapter 11: Producing and Releasing Responsive ESI
You must carefully document each step so that if the case reaches court, 
lawyers can show that no one altered the ESI as the investigation progressed. 
Without a documented chain of custody, proving that ESI has not been 
altered after the fact is impossible. Computer forensics toolkits perform the 
necessary recordkeeping and documentation of proper handling.
A chain of custody doesn’t only apply to the ESI at the file or document level. 
A chain can also be applied to or at different levels, including the following:
	
✓	The hardware, such as laptops, PDAs, cellphones, and any other digital 
device
	
✓	An entire data set
	
✓	Files
With respect to the preservation and collection of ESI, you should document 
all actions done to hardware as part of an electronic chain of custody. Chain 
of custody logs track how ESI is gathered, analyzed, and preserved for pro­
duction. This means documenting which files were opened, every search and 
action performed, and the time and date of every step. These logs typically 
include a description of the forensic acquisition methodology used, minimize 
susceptibility to attack, and enhance credibility before a judge, particularly 
against an allegation of tampering. 
Just as hardware or storage media containing ESI must be treated as evi­
dence, the same rule applies to each individual file. File-level chain of custody 
is a technical process to determine or validate what had happened to a file 
prior to being admitted in a case. Chapter 13 discusses the computer foren­
sics techniques used to perform this level of authentication, to ensure that 
each piece of evidence was handled properly, or to determine that it wasn’t.
Keeping Metadata Intact
The form or forms of production would have been agreed to at the meet-and-
confer session. The four forms of production are
	
✓	Native: Files are produced in their original (native) format with meta­
data intact. Examples are load files, extracted metadata, searchable text, 
and eXtensible markup language (XML). The EDRM developed a stan­
dard XML load file. Many e-discovery software and service providers are 
XML-compliant because of that format’s benefits. Here are the big ben­
efits of XML:
 
• Reduces the costs of moving data from one program to the 
another, as well as one company to another.
 
• Minimizes errors.

194
Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
 
• Crashes (cuts) cycle times for production and delivery of ESI.
 
• Minimizes e-discovery disputes because of it is a very adaptable 
load file format.
	
✓	Near-native: As the term implies, this format is very similar to producing 
the file in its original format. Near-native files are extracted or converted 
from their original form into another searchable format. 
	
✓	Near-paper: These are files that are converted to a non-searchable 
image file. They’re called image files because they’re basically pictures 
of the text or data. 
	
✓	Paper or hard copy: The files are printed and produced on paper. 
Obviously, they’re also non-searchable and most likely will get you into 
trouble with your opponent and the court. You need to produce in a 
format that is potentially easily reviewable by your opponent.
Some litigants want to produce only in native form because of the cost 
involved in converting the native files to images for an image production. 
Others prefer not to produce in native format unless specifically requested to 
do so to keep the opposing party from having the metadata. If you must pro­
duce metadata — and you can safely expect that you’ll need to — there are 
two forms of production:
	
✓	Native file, which inherently has its metadata intact
	
✓	Image format with extracted data, including metadata and the full text of 
the file
When you use one these two forms of production, ESI has its own built-in 
evidence that, when handled properly, demonstrates, among other things, no 
one has changed the ESI since it was preserved.
The decision to request and produce extracted data and metadata will be 
influenced by the manner in which the documents were collected, processed, 
and reviewed. If the data wasn’t preserved properly, the ESI that’s produced 
may reflect the dates it was collected or reviewed as the creation or modi­
fication dates, which will be misleading. For example, when you download 
a file, the creation date and time is that of your download and not the origi­
nal. These errors may raise questions about the collection, processing, and 
review processes. Get in front of this train by being aware of and upfront

 Chapter 11: Producing and Releasing Responsive ESI
Court grants plaintiff’s motion 
to compel re-production
White v. Graceland College Center for 
Professional Development & Lifelong Learning, 
Inc., (2009) was a wrongful termination case. 
The plaintiff filed a motion to compel a re-
production because of insufficient production. 
While reviewing e-mails and attachments pro­
duced by the defendant, the plaintiff noticed 
discrepancies in the dates. Sent dates of the 
e-mails differed from the created dates of their 
attachments. The plaintiff contended that those 
dates were relevant to the issue of when the 
decision to terminate her employment was 
made. 
The defendant claimed that the decision to ter­
minate the plaintiff was made on July 2, 2004, 
but an attachment to a relevant e-mail showed 
a created date of June 9, 2004. In order to deter­
mine the actual dates, the plaintiff’s computer 
forensics expert needed to review e-mail from 
both the sender’s Sent items and the recipient’s 
inbox. And he needed access to the computer 
that created the e-mails and their attachments. 
In response, the defendants explained that the 
discrepancies were “due to the documents 
being templates,” which were modified as 
needed. The defendants claimed that not all of 
the e-mails sought for re-production were avail­
able from the sources specified. Specifically, 
defendants indicated that e-mails of the Vice 
President of Human Resources were not avail­
able prior to 2005, and that e-mails previously 
produced were the only versions available and 
could not be located for re-production in the 
locations specified by the plaintiff.
Lacking any explanation from defendants 
regarding why the e-mails were unavailable, 
the court granted the plaintiff’s request and 
ordered the defendants to re-produce, in their 
native format, the e-mails and attachments 
from both the e-mails’ recipients and senders. 
If defendants were unable to do so, they were 
ordered to provide an explanation for why they 
could not.

Part IV: Processing, Protecting, and Producing ESI 
No mistake left unmade
In Drew Heriot & Drew Pictures Pty LTD v. 
Byrne, (2008), a copyright-infringement case, 
the parties sought to settle the issue of copy­
right ownership over a made-for-television 
movie called The Secret. 
The defendants made a motion concerning 
documents that the plaintiffs had produced 
in response to the defendants’ request. On 
July 25, 2008, the defendants served the plain­
tiffs with their First Request for Production of 
Documents, which included a request for “. . . 
[a]ll documents relating to United States visa 
applications filed by or on behalf of Heriot.”
To comply with the defendants’ production 
request, the plaintiffs hired a document vendor, 
which provided OCR scanning and other dis­
covery services for the case. The subsequent 
process by which the plaintiffs eventually pro­
duced the documents included the following 
steps:
	 1.	 The vendor created a master database of 
the documents provided to it by the plain­
tiffs, which the plaintiffs could then review. 
	 2.	 During April and May 2008, plaintiffs hired 
paralegals and other non-lawyers to con­
duct a preliminary review of the documents 
in the master database. The reviewers 
coded the documents using general pre­
trial discovery codes. One general code 
was immigration, which the plaintiffs used 
to flag e-mails and other documents that 
pertained to Mr. Heriot’s immigration to the 
United States.
	 3.	 The plaintiffs searched for responsive doc­
uments in their master database. 
	 4.	 Once identified, these responsive docu­
ments were coded for subsequent copying 
and inclusion in the production database.
Several months into the litigation, the plaintiffs’ 
document vendor made a processing mistake 
that resulted in the production of privileged 
materials. Nearly two months later, while pre­
paring for depositions, the plaintiffs learned 
of the inadvertent production. The plaintiffs 
claimed the materials were protected by the 
attorney-client privilege. The defendants 
argued that their privilege was waived through 
disclosure. 
The Court reviewed the documents over which 
the plaintiffs asserted attorney-client privilege. 
After an exhaustive page-by-page review of 
these documents and an entry-by-entry review 
of the privilege log, the Court reserved (delayed) 
its ruling on whether they are protected by the 
attorney-client privilege.
The ruling was delayed because many of the 
documents contained multiple e-mails and for­
warded e-mails that intermingled privileged and 
unprivileged documents. Some of these e-mails 
were entirely unprotected and in no way could 
be claimed as covered by the attorney-client 
privilege. One document, for example, con­
tained an e-mail that stated nothing more than 
an individual’s Christmas wishes. Forcing the 
Court to read individuals’ good tidings may have 
salutary effects, but efficiency and clarity are 
not among them.
This pile of jumbled documents created a huge 
intractable problem because the Court might 
have had to order the defendants to redact all 
or part of the documents. The following quote 
details the judge’s strong opinion, anger with 
the defendants, and final decision. You don’t 
want to be on the receiving end of this type of 
reaction from a judge.

unpaginated documents is not only burden­
some, it is a waste of this Court’s time. The party 
asserting privilege, not the Court, should orga­
nize the documents in a manner that enables 
an efficient and effective determination of 
privilege.
“Because Defendants failed to accomplish 
this task, the Court will withhold its ruling on 
whether the documents are protected by the 
attorney-client privilege until after Defendants 
submit an amended privilege log and a revised 
compilation of documents for in camera review. 
The revised compilation of documents should be 
separated chronologically on a e-mail-by-e-mail 
basis such that each listed ‘document’ contains 
only one e-mail-and labeled so the Court can 
efficiently rule on each. If a series of e-mails 
belong together in a ‘chain,’ Defendants should 
group and label those e-mails accordingly. 
Defendants should also place Bates numbers 
or other means of identification on each page, 
something they failed to do on the documents 
they submitted to this Court. Additionally, the 
amended privilege log, which is to be submitted 
under seal (along with the revised compilation 
of documents), should describe, in sufficient 
detail, the circumstances surrounding each 
e-mail and Defendants’ argument as to why it 
should be considered privileged. Finally, the 
amended privilege log must ‘comport[] with this 
district’s case law.’”
The judge’s decision was that privilege was 
not waived because the disclosure was inad­
vertent and the plaintiffs acted promptly after 
discovering the disclosure mistake. The judge, 
however, delayed making a decision on attor­
ney-client privilege until the plaintiff submitted 
an amended privilege log and a revised compi­
lation of the documents.

Par t V
Get ting Litigation 
Ready

In this part . . .
I
n this fifth part, we look at ESI as evidence, specifically 
admissible e-evidence, and forensics methods to 
recover and preserve it. In Chapter 12, you learn that for 
evidence to be admissible, the first hurdle is proving that 
it’s relevant to a disputed issue. Although the relevance 
rule requires only ESI that’s closely related to facts that 
matter in the case, just how close is vague. You realize 
that rules of evidence are subject to judgment, as are the 
federal rules of civil procedure. Having learned about the 
federal rules and the challenges to privilege, you’re 
prepped for the judgment calls and exceptions to rules 
that you read of in this chapter.
Chapter 12 also covers advanced e-discovery strategies 
and issues, some of which are the use of experts, sanc­
tions, depositions, and cost-shifting when you’re being 
financially crushed by big “undue” burdens.
Authenticating evidence in civil trials is relatively new, as 
you learn in Chapters 12 and 13. Traditionally, authentica­
tion was primarily argued in criminal cases; that is, until 
case law (Lorraine v. Markel Am. Ins. Co.) brought it into 
the civil sphere. You begin to understand persuasive 
methods for authenticating evidence, including those that 
fall under the scope of computer forensics. Also, you dis­
cover how to keep the chain of custody intact because 
you can’t untaint tainted e-evidence.

D
uring the e-discovery process, you focus on the applicability of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP). But when it comes to submit­
ting evidence for consideration by the court, you have to turn your focus 
to the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE). These are the rules used by federal 
judges to determine what evidence will be admissible in court. Each state 
has its own rules of evidence, but most are close to the federal rules. Just 
because something is subject to discovery does not mean that it is admis­
sible in court.
If you want to admit your evidence in court, you must lay a proper founda­
tion for its admissibility. You must prove — authenticate — that the ESI is 
what you say it is.
In this chapter, you travel the evidentiary highway and find out what is nec­
essary to authenticate and admit ESI into court.
	
To be successful, you need to consider evidentiary issues from the onset of 
the case. First, give some thought to the records management for purposes 
of getting ESI authenticated for admission to the court (see Chapter 14 where 
we discuss setting up a record management system). After all, you don’t want 
to go to the expense and time collecting evidence to have it thrown out of the 
case at some point.

Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
Looking at the Roles of 
the Judge and Jury
In legal cases, the judge determines the law and the jury determines the facts. 
If there is no jury, then the judge serves both roles. When there is a jury, there 
is a complex interplay between the judge and jury on evidentiary questions.
FRE 104 provides that the court determines the preliminary questions of 
admissibility including:
	
✓	The qualification of a person to be a witness
	
✓	The admissibility of evidence
	
✓	The existence of a privilege
	
✓	Whether a condition has been met if relevancy is based on a condition 
of fact
The court is bound to the rules of evidence except when considering privi­
lege. For example, a judge could allow hearsay evidence (an out-of-court 
statement offered as proof) if a witness is not available to testify.
After the judge has admitted the evidence, the jury decides what weight to 
give it. Evidence is often contradictory, with both sides taking a different 
view of what is offered. The jury has to decide what it believes, including the 
credibility of the witnesses.
	
If the judge makes a preliminary ruling not to admit your evidence, the jury 
never hears or sees it. If there is not a jury trial, the judge doesn’t consider the 
excluded evidence while ruling.
Qualifying an Expert
Experts are not just those in scientific or technical areas but also the broad 
category of specialized knowledge. For example, a stockbroker giving testi­
mony of a stock market analysis. Experts might become such from experi­
ence, skill, or knowledge as well as education. A person who has years of 
experience in working with a certain software program may be considered 
an expert without any formal training.

In Galaxy Computer Services, Inc. v. Baker, the court allowed a person to testify 
as an expert who had no degree in computer science, was not an expert in 
computer language, was not a computer programmer, but was a member of 
the High Crime Investigation Association and completed three postgraduate 
training courses in computer forensics. The weight given to the witness’s 
opinion is a matter for the jury.
If a witness is determined to be an expert, they may testify in the form of an 
opinion or otherwise. For example, the testimony could be about various 
theories of a particular issue, and the jury decides which theory is correct.
FRE Rule 702 covers experts. The question of whether that person is an 
expert is determined by the judge. Under FRE Rule 702, a witness may testify 
whether:
	
✓	The testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data.
	
✓	The testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods. 
	
✓	The expert has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts.
The facts and data relied on do not have to be admissible in court if they are 
of the type normally relied upon by experts in the field. Experts are allowed 
to give their opinions on facts that are determinative of the case (for exam­
ple, if you had data wrongfully deleted from the computers). Under FRE Rule 
705, the expert may give their opinion without first setting forth the facts or 
data underlying that opinion. The court may order that it be disclosed prior 
to giving the opinion.
In Daubert v. Merrel Dow Pharms., Inc., the court set forth a non-exclusive 
checklist to use in assessing the reliability of expert testimony. The factors are
	
✓	Can the expert’s technique or theory be objectively tested for reliability?
	
✓	Has the expert’s technique or theory been the subject of peer review 
and publication, for example, in an academic journal?
	
✓	What are the techniques or theories known or potential error rate?
	
✓	What standards and/or controls were used in applying the technique or 
theory?
	
✓	Does the technique or theory have general acceptance in the appropri­
ate scientific community?
These factors might be applied to various degrees by different courts but 
provide a baseline for determination. They are also instructive in non-
scientific cases. Additionally, courts may apply other factors as determined 
by the discretion of that judge.

204
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
Getting Through the Five 
Hurdles of Admissibility
Judge Grimm in Lorraine v. Markel American Ins. Co. went into great detail 
on the admissibility of ESI. This case has become the principle case in this 
area. It has formed the basis of The Sedona Conference Commentary on ESI 
Evidence & Admissibility, which can be found at www.thesedona
conference.org.
This case established the following rules when getting ESI admitted: 
	
✓	Is the ESI relevant as determined by Rule 401 (does it have any tendency 
to make some fact that is of consequence to the litigation more or less 
probable that it otherwise would be)?
	
✓	If relevant under Rule 401, is it authentic as required under Rule 901(a) 
(can you show that the ESI is what it purports to be)?
	
✓	If the ESI is offered for its substantive truth, is it hearsay as defined by 
Rule 801, and if so, is it covered by an applicable exception (Rules 803, 
804 and 807)?
	
✓	If the ESI is in original or duplicate form under the original writing rule, 
or if not, is there admissible secondary evidence to prove the content of 
the ESI (Rules 1001-1008)?
	
✓	Is the probative value of the ESI substantially outweighed by the danger 
of unfair prejudice or one of the other factors identified by Rule 403, 
such that it should be excluded despite its relevance?
This creates a roadmap of the steps to get ESI admitted before the court. It’s 
your guide to making sure the jury considers the evidence you want it to. We 
talk about each of these hurdles in the rest of the chapter.
Admitting Relevant ESI
The first major hurdle is relevance. To be admissible, the ESI must be 
relevant. ESI relevance means that the ESI has the tendency to make the 
existence of a fact more probable or less probable. In other words, that some­
thing did or did not happen. The fact in question must be of consequence to 
the case.

205
 Chapter 12: Dealing with Evidentiary Issues and Challenges
Authenticating ESI
Authentication comes down to three steps:
	
✓	You prove the ESI is what you’re saying it is.
	
✓	The judge makes a preliminary determination of whether the ESI has suf­
ficient probative value for a jury to rationally believe that the ESI is what 
it purports to be.
	
✓	The jury decides whether the ESI is what it purports to be.
You can authenticate evidence either directly or circumstantially:
	
✓	Direct evidence is testimony by the person who created the evidence 
(for example, an e-mail).
	
✓	Circumstantial evidence is outside evidence such as distinctive charac­
teristics, content, and appearance. For example, an e-mail that contains 
details in response to a conversation between two persons might indi­
cate that it was authored by that person.
FRE Rule 901 on authentication provides examples of authentication. Here 
are some ways you can have ESI authenticated:
	
✓	Testimony by a witness with knowledge that it is what it is claimed 
to be: The author or person who created it testifies to its authenticity. 
A person who has general knowledge of how that evidence is routinely 
made can also testify.
	
✓	Comparison with specimens that have been authenticated: Expert 
witnesses can compare something to ones that have already been 
authenticated.
	
✓	Distinctive characteristics: Appearance, contents, substance, internal 
patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with 
the circumstances.
	
	For example, e-mail that contains unique facts that are known to the per­
sons alleged to have sent it. Some courts have developed a reply letter 
doctrine for authentication. If an e-mail is clearly in reply to another, 
and you can establish that the person received the first e-mail and the 
contents refer to that first e-mail, the judge can authenticate the reply 
e-mail. Also, an expert could offer testimony of the technical transmis­
sion and internal identification (metadata) to authenticate it.
	
✓	Public records, reports, or data compilation: You only need to show 
that the office where the records were obtained is the legal custodian of 
those records.
	
✓	Evidence produced by an accurate process or system: This can be used 
for ESI that is automatically generated by computers, such as metadata.

206
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
	
The ultimate decision is up to the jury. The jury might hear contradictory evi­
dence and not believe it is authentic.
Self-authenticating ESI
Judges do consider some ESI as self-authenticating. Rule 902 contains a list of 
items that you don’t need to authenticate. They include the following:
	
✓	Public documents under seal.
	
✓	Certified copies of public records.
	
✓	Newspapers and periodicals.
	
✓	Trade inscriptions and the like. Inscriptions, signs, tags, or labels pur­
porting to have been affixed in the course of business and indicating 
ownership, control, or origin. An e-mail that identifies the company and 
contains information showing the origin of the e-mail might be authenti­
cated by some court using this rule.
	
✓	Documents that are acknowledged with a notarized seal or its 
equivalent.
	
✓	Business records if accompanied by a declaration of the custodian or 
other qualified person certifying that:
 
• It was made at or near the time of the occurrence by the person 
with knowledge of the matters or from information received from a 
person with knowledge of those matters.
 
• It was kept in the course of regularly conducted activity and it was 
the regular practice of such activity to keep such records.
	
	If the maker does not have personal knowledge of the details of the busi­
ness record, then he must have received it from someone who does 
have knowledge and a duty to transmit that knowledge to the person 
recording it (for example, minutes sent to the secretary of a corpora­
tion). Some courts have allowed the authentication as a business 
record even without the business duty to transmit the information if 
the recipient had a business duty to verify the accuracy of the informa­
tion received.
	
If you intend to offer self-authenticated ESI, you must notify your opponent in 
advance so they can prepare to challenge it.
Following the chain of custody
Documenting your chain of custody of all ESI includes recording each step 
of the gathering, reviewing, and preserving process. The chain of custody is 

207
 Chapter 12: Dealing with Evidentiary Issues and Challenges
important if the ESI might have been altered or changed at any time from its 
creation to the introduction as evidence. This may be especially important if 
the data was analyzed in any way. For ESI, it might mean the use of forensic 
analysis. To maintain a proper chain of evidence, a proper document mainte­
nance plan is vital. You need to detail the process of storage, collection, and 
review. You should refrain from altering the originals in any way.
Hashing is very important in establishing that the offered ESI is what it was 
originally. Hashing is a method used to provide ESI with a unique number. 
This allows you to later identify the ESI and determine whether it is in its 
original form or has been altered. This numbering identification is called its 
hash value.
To ensure reliability of the ESI, follow these steps:
	
1.	Establish a document maintenance and collection procedure before 
any litigation.
	
2.	Establish a system of document identification within that maintenance 
and collection procedure.
	
3.	Identify the ESI in a manner that will provide reliability of the data 
after it’s produced for discovery.
	
	 An example might be hash values.
	
4.	Maintain a log of all activity relevant to the ESI including obtaining, 
accessing, storing, and transferring the ESI.
	
	 This should be coordinated with the preservation log.
	
5.	Regularly review to make sure there is compliance with the proce­
dures established.
	
Keep in mind these two tips while you’re going through the collection process:
	
✓	Allow only trained persons access to any ESI. Access should be limited 
to those with a legitimate need to have access.
	
✓	Designate a person who has ultimate responsibility and control of 
the ESI.
Authenticating specific types of ESI
The general rules of authentication apply to all forms of ESI. It does not 
matter whether it is an e-mail, a word processing document, or a text 
message.
Table 12-1 sets forth the typical rules applied in some specialized forms 
of ESI.

Analyzing the Hearsay Rule
When you clear the authentication hurdle, your evidence might still not be 
admitted if it violates the hearsay rule.
Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered by a person to prove the truth of 
the matter asserted. Hearsay is not just limited to verbal utterances as you 
might assume; it includes documents and ESI that are offered to prove the 
truth of what is said in the contents. If you offer an e-mail to prove the truth 
of the contents, and the person who wrote it is not available, your evidence 
is hearsay.
Exceptions to the hearsay rule can allow the evidence to be admitted. The 
jury gets to decide what weight to put on your evidence.

209
 Chapter 12: Dealing with Evidentiary Issues and Challenges
Two applicable provisions of the FRE provide exceptions to the hearsay rule. 
Rule 803 has 23 exceptions to the rule, while Rule 807 provides a residual 
exception. The key to the exceptions is that the ESI must have some circum­
stantial support for the court to believe that it is trustworthy. For example, 
authenticated business records would have that trustworthiness.
Some of the Rule 803 exceptions most applicable to authenticated ESI are
	
✓	Present sense impression: Describing or explaining an event or condi­
tion made while the person making it was experiencing it or right after. 
An example might be an e-mail made right after an event that describes 
what happened.
	
✓	Excited utterance: Made while under the stress of excitement caused by 
the event. An example might be a text message or a Twitter tweet made 
while at the scene of an accident.
	
✓	Existing mental, emotional, or physical condition: Relating to the 
emotional state of mind, a sensation, or the declarant’s physical condi­
tion. This may go to show intent, planning, and motive. For example, an 
e-mail where the person writing it states how angry they are with their 
employer and would like to take revenge for a perceived wrong.
	
✓	Recorded recollections: This is often used to refresh the recollection of 
a witness who wrote it down at one point but now has forgotten some of 
the details.
	
✓	Ancient records: Statements in documents more than 20 years old.
	
✓	Learned treatises: Statements published in treatises, periodicals, or the 
like that have been established as reliable authorities.
	
✓	Business records: This rule is the same as for authentication. They go 
hand and hand. See the previous section, “Self-authenticating ESI,” for a 
discussion on business records authentication.
The next major exception to the hearsay rule is provided in Rule 807. Your 
evidence must have an equivalent that guarantees the trustworthiness appli­
cable to other hearsay exceptions and:
	
✓	Be offered as evidence of a material fact. If the fact it is offered to prove 
is not material, it cannot be admitted.
	
✓	The statement offered must be more probative on the point than any 
other evidence that you can get through other reasonable means.
	
✓	The general purpose of the rules and the interests of justice will be best 
served by admitting the evidence.
If you plan to use this rule, you must let the other party know in advance so 
they can properly prepare any challenge they might make.

210
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
	
If the ESI is offered to prove the truth of what is in it, then the hearsay rules 
apply. You might go through discovery and authentication and still not get it 
admitted into court.
Providing the Best Evidence
The best evidence rule provides that to prove the contents of a writing or 
ESI, you must provide the original. A copy is allowed as long as there is no 
question of its authenticity. If you can’t reasonably obtain a copy, then the 
rules allow testimony to determine the contents (such as testimony of a 
person who read the contents or by an admission against the party who 
offered them).
In the area of ESI data stored in a computer or similar device, such as a 
server, an original is any printout or other output readable by sight, shown to 
reflect the data accurately. If the contents are voluminous, they may be pre­
sented in the form of charts or summaries with the originals made available 
to the other party for copying.
Generally, the best evidence rule does not create a problem for ESI. Electronic 
images, such as a TIFF or a PDF, are acceptable original printouts. One issue 
that you might be confronted with is whether a printout is actually an origi­
nal if it does not contain the metadata. Typically, metadata is not produced 
on paper copies of the documents, such as word processing or spreadsheet 
documents. It can be argued that without the metadata, a printout is not a 
true copy of the original; it is not an identical but a fraternal twin. You should 
consult with your counsel to determine whether to disclose the metadata.
Probing the Value of the ESI
Even if evidence is admissible, the court may still use its discretion not to 
admit it. For example, Rule 403 allows a judge to exclude relevant evidence 
if the judge determines that the prejudice to the other party outweighs its 
probative value. The judge may also exclude it if there is a determination that 
the evidence will cause confusion or is a waste of time or needlessly cumula­
tive. For example, you don’t need 1,000 e-mails that all say the same thing to 
show the one fact contained in them.

example, an employee stealing confidential data or sending harassing e-mail), 
then preserving and maintaining ESI using computer forensics methods in 
accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
ensures its admissibility in court and prevents spoliation. The courts may 
require a forensic exam of one or more of your company’s computers if your 
opponent shows a good cause for one. In these scenarios, your lawyer may 
recommend that a computer forensics expert join your e-discovery team to 
make a forensically sound copy of one or more hard drives. A forensically 
sound copy (also called an image) is an accurate and complete duplicate of 
the source evidence on a hard drive. The computer forensic tools and meth­
ods used to create the image also include ways to verify that its contents 
haven’t been altered.
Either by choice at the outset of e-discovery or later by court order, you may 
want or need to go the extra mile in effort and expense by employing a com­
puter forensic expert to preserve, recover, restore, or search ESI. Computer 
forensics, like special teams in football, may not be on the field very much, 
but those specialists can play pivotal roles in the game. Learning from the 
experience of others is always less expensive than finding out for yourself.

Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
In this chapter, you can find out more about the functions that computer 
forensics experts can perform in your e-discovery efforts, including preserva­
tion, indexing keywords, authentication, recovery, and maintenance of the 
chain of custody. You’ll want to select a vendor whose commercial and pro­
prietary tools have the ability to recover, reconstruct, and analyze data all 
of your types of ESI, then to catalog and export to a document management 
tool, such as Concordance or Summation, for review.
Powering Up Computer Forensics
Some cases may require more than the standard e-discovery procedures 
(which we cover in Chapters 6–8). Cases with complications may necessi­
tate taking your e-discovery up a notch. Computer forensics tools are used 
by experts to recover hidden or lost ESI, reconstruct the timeline of events, 
interpret the meaning of the evidence, and authenticate when the ESI was 
created and by whom. In brief, if there’s ESI that you need to find or that 
needs to be admitted into evidence by the court, you need computer foren­
sics. You want to take action on this procedure as soon as possible. After 
you’ve produced the ESI and it’s rejected by the court because you can’t 
authenticate it, you find out firsthand about the support that computer foren­
sics can bring to a disputed issue in a case. 
	
In a class action lawsuit in which investors claimed they’d been defrauded, 
state prosecutors brought suit against financial advisors. The defense 
received an agreement from the prosecutors that they would not dispute their 
e-mails. One e-mail in particular was pivotal exculpatory evidence that inves­
tors hadn’t been deceived. As such, defense decided at that time that they 
didn’t need a computer forensic expert. During testimony by the defendant, 
his lawyer presented one key e-mail that the prosecutor refused to accept. 
The judge held that, to be admissible, the e-mail had to be authenticated. Of 
course, it was too late for the defense because there are no do-overs with elec­
tronic evidence.
Knowing when to hire an expert
You’ll want to hire a computer forensics specialist when you suspect that ESI 
has been accidentally, intentionally, innocently, or maliciously compromised 
or you’re concerned that illegal activity has been covered up in one or more 
of the following ways: 
	
✓	Withheld: ESI exists and is known about, but has not been produced. 
When the collection basket was passed around, this ESI didn’t make 
it in.

213
 Chapter 13: Bringing In Special Forces: Computer Forensics
	
✓	Deleted: ESI is no longer available or accessible through the operating 
system.
	
	Delete is a misnomer because when you delete a file, its physical pres­
ence doesn’t change. The file stays put until the operating system snuffs 
it out.
	
✓	Disguised: The file extension is deleted or changed to hide the ESI’s 
true identity. For example, an Excel spreadsheet could be changed from 
.xlsx to .jpg or .wav to throw off the search for spreadsheets. 
	
✓	Tampered with: Contents of the file or its metadata (identifying informa­
tion) are changed to try to get rid of the original and throw off anyone 
who examining it. Tampering with a file is one of the most common 
tricks to rewrite history, so to speak. For example, performance reports, 
messages, or contracts can be recast in a different light by doing a little 
digital editing. 
	
✓	Planted: ESI is made to exist. Keep in mind that there’s no perfect crime 
when e-evidence is involved. People who plant evidence leave a trail 
and usually make mistakes. Lazy people who try to plant ESI create the 
easiest-to-detect plants because they don’t invest the effort required to 
plant hard-to-detect e-evidence.
	
✓	Password protected: The file cannot be opened without the password. 
Company policy or a user’s personal habits or paranoia might be to 
safeguard their files by sealing them with a password. If the password is 
written on a sticky note attached to the monitor, getting into the files is 
not challenging. 
	
✓	Encrypted: The file can be opened, but the contents are scrambled by 
an encryption algorithm or key. Encrypted files are practically impos­
sible to decrypt without knowing the key and the method of encryption. 
Don’t bother looking for sticky notes for the key because the keys are 
digital.
	
✓	Headerless encrypted files: The files have been encrypted and are 
impossible for the operating system to detect because they have no 
header. Files don’t get tougher to open than these. 
Typically, normal e-discovery processes don’t detect complicated files or 
conditions. You need the power of computer forensics — digital archeology — 
to detect or uncover these files or conditions and interpret what they indi­
cate. Computer forensics may be the only way to recover or restore deleted 
content or attempts to hide and disguise files.

214
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
Knowing what to expect from an expert
Here are the functions that you’d hire an expert to perform:
	
✓	Recover ESI proving that someone has done something or an action 
or event has happened. This situation is the most straightforward. You 
want convincing evidence of what’s been done. Examples are e-mail 
showing illicit activity or correspondence capturing details of the theft 
of intellectual property.
	
✓	Recover ESI proving that an alleged action or event didn’t happen. 
Proving a negative might be tougher than the situation in the preceding 
bullet. What the expert can do after examining the ESI is provide plau­
sible alternative explanations for what’s observed in the ESI. 
	
✓	Examine and interpret the opposing party’s or third-party’s ESI. In 
some cases, you might need the expert to examine another party’s ESI to 
assess whether it support the allegations.
	
✓	Evaluate the evidentiary strength of the ESI. Your lawyer might need 
an expert to interpret the strength of the ESI, particularly prior to the 
meet-and-confer session, so he can negotiate from a position of strength. 
	
✓	Rebut the findings of the opposing party’s expert. If your opponent 
retains a computer forensics expert, you’ll want to counter with your 
own. Your expert can examine the expert’s report for inconsistencies, 
omissions, or illogical conclusions.
Prior to retaining an expert, your lawyer will interview her to verify her cre­
dentials, to verify that there’s no conflict of interest with any of the parties 
in the case, and to verify whether she can help prove or help build the case. 
However, there’s the possibility that the computer forensics expert will draw 
conclusions from the ESI he or she has examined that might not be the con­
clusions you want. Your lawyer may decide not to use that expert. 
Judging an expert like judges do
Since the 1990s, the Supreme Court has demanded strict standards for the 
admissibility of scientific expert testimony in federal courts. In its defining 
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals (1993) opinion, the Supreme Court 
created what’s called the Daubert test or Daubert standard. The Daubert test 
looks at the relevance of the evidence. For testimony to be allowed in court, 
it must be closely tied to the facts of the case so that it helps the judge or 
jury (referred to as the triers of fact) understand the issues being disputed. 
Because the triers of fact rely on the expert to understand the evidence, a 
strict standard for experts is crucial.

215
 Chapter 13: Bringing In Special Forces: Computer Forensics
In some courts, the Federal Rule of Evidence 702 may apply. Rule 702 governs 
the admissibility of expert testimony and states the following:
“If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier 
of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a wit­
ness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or 
education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.”
Your expert’s credentials and conclusions need to be sufficient to withstand 
the opposing counsel’s attempt to discredit them. 
Your expert needs sufficient time to do the following:
	
✓	Acquire the ESI without altering it.
	
✓	Authenticate it.
	
✓	Analyze it.
	
✓	Prepare a report explaining the findings.
As such, involving an expert as early as possible is to your advantage.
Doing a Scientific Forensic Search 
A computer forensics investigation is a process that uses science and technol­
ogy to examine ESI. Computer forensics’ distinctive characteristic is that it 
uses the scientific method, or forensic science. Here’s the general sequence 
of steps in the scientific method:
	
1.	Raise a question, issue, or concern.
	
2.	Observe systematically, or identify and collect or record data. 
	
	 Your observations are not proof, but information on which to formulate 
a hypothesis.
	
3.	Develop one or multiple working hypotheses. 
	
	 A hypothesis is an educated guess or idea to explain observations. A 
hypothesis should offer a rational explanation of an event based on 
what’s observed or not observed. 
	
4.	Test the working hypotheses based on analysis of a representative 
sample of the evidence, and do one of the following:
	
	a. Accept the hypothesis.
	
	b. Reject the hypothesis.
	
	c. Modify the hypothesis.

216
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
	
5.	When you have evidentiary support for the hypothesis, you accept it 
and reject the others, and it becomes a theory (or a conclusion).
	
	 A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations that’s been 
proven or verified by unbiased researchers or investigators. Theories 
tend to remain until new information or evidence causes them to be 
displaced by a new theory. For example, the early theory that the earth 
is flat was replaced with the theory that the earth is round. So far, the 
round-earth theory remains unchallenged. 
	
6.	If or when new evidence appears that’s not consistent with the theory, 
then conduct the scientific method again. 
	
	 A hypothesis is tested and perhaps re-tested as new evidence is recov­
ered or examined. Once evidence is found to refute the theory, the test­
ing and sampling begins again. 
Either formally or informally, cases start with working hypotheses, which 
may then lead to the development of a theory that tells a compelling or con­
vincing story based on the evidence. 
	
Electronic discovery requires you to run a lot of search queries and record 
which documents are associated with each of the queries.
Testing, Sampling, and Refining 
Searches for ESI
Data sampling is done to check for responsive material without taking the 
time — or incurring the expense — of doing a full review. Finding ESI can con­
sist of a series of tests, samples, and refining searches to refute a hypothesis. 
	
Doing a series of refining searches is considered a best practice; doing just 
one search is not a best practice! If you have to defend what you did or didn’t 
do, you want to be on the side of best practices.
Here’s how you scientifically examine an e-mail:
	
1.	 Do intelligence.
	
	 The process begins with an analysis of the situation or intelligence scan 
to gain a basic understanding of the issues surrounding the incident. 
	
2.	 Formulate a hypothesis.
	
	 You can hypothesize that there are no responsive e-mail messages on 
any of the five e-mail server backups whose contents are within the rel­
evant date range. 

217
 Chapter 13: Bringing In Special Forces: Computer Forensics
	
3.	 Create a forensic copy to be used for the analysis. 
	
	 Acquire the ESI of one of the servers, which you read about in the 
upcoming section “Acquiring and preserving the image” in this chapter. 
You then use this forensic copy, and not the original, to perform the 
following steps. The forensic software creates an index (listing) of the 
words (including names) found in the files as it’s creating the forensic 
copy. The original storage devices holding the ESI are stored in a secure 
location and never examined because examining a file changes its meta­
data and could alter its contents. The generally accepted method is to 
examine the forensic copy to keep the original evidence untainted.
	
4.	 Test.
	
	 Run a search (also called a query) for e-mails using key words, key 
phrases, and the names of people related to the case. During e-discovery, 
every document in the search results must be reviewed for relevance, 
privilege, and protection, not just the most relevant ones. Because of 
the necessity to review everything, determining the scope of the search 
becomes more difficult. 
 
• Over-inclusive searches drive up costs of downstream production 
and review, as we discuss in Chapter 9.
 
• Under-inclusive searches increase the risk of challenges to your 
search methodology’s thoroughness, which put you on the 
defensive. 
	
5.	 Draw conclusions. 
	
	Review the results of the query to determine the number of responsive 
e-mails. Reviewing for privilege and protected documents is also done 
during this stage.
 
•	If you find no responsive e-mails, accept the hypothesis. You can 
conclude that a full review of the other servers isn’t worth the time 
and cost.
 
• If you find responsive e-mails, reject the hypothesis. You can con­
clude that you need to search the other servers (if you’re sure the 
e-mail messages are not available anywhere else).
	
The results of this type of scientific sampling also create a sample that you 
can use for further testing. For example, the discards — the e-mail messages 
that were not tagged as responsive — create a sample that you can use to test 
the adequacy of the search terms, phrases, and names used in the query. You 
get extra mileage because you can use the output (results) of one scientific 
method as input for another test. 

218
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
	
Attempting to reverse engineer the scientific method by forcing the ESI to fit a 
self-serving hypothesis is a doomed method because it’s unreasonable. 
Hearing from the judge that you did something unreasonable will most likely 
be followed by something that requires a lot of explaining, effort, or expense. 
Applying C-Forensics to e-Discovery
A computer forensics expert can support the e-discovery process by iden­
tifying more possibilities for finding relevant ESI. Forensics experts can 
help identify places to look, signs to look for, and additional sources. These 
sources may be earlier versions of memos or spreadsheets that still exist on 
the computer’s disk or on backup media. 
A computer forensics professional ensures that
	
✓	ESI is protected against damage, destruction, or compromise by anyone 
else who investigates the computer. 
	
✓	The system is protected against malware, such as viruses, worms, and 
Trojan horses during the analysis process. 
	
✓	Extracted ESI is properly handled and protected from later mechanical 
or electromagnetic damage. 
	
✓	A continuing chain of custody is established and maintained. 
	
✓	Business operations are affected for a limited amount of time, if at all. 
	
✓	Any client-attorney information that is inadvertently acquired during a 
forensic exploration is ethically and legally respected and not divulged. 
The computer forensics specialist takes these steps to identify and retrieve 
ESI that may exist on a computer system:
	
✓	Protects the computer system during the forensic examination from any 
possible alteration, damage, data corruption, or virus introduction. 
	
✓	Discovers all files on the storage media. This includes existing normal 
files, deleted yet remaining files, hidden files, password-protected files, 
and encrypted files. 
	
✓	Recovers all or as much as possible of discovered deleted files. 
	
✓	Reveals contents of hidden files to an extent, as well as the contents of 
temporary or swap files used by both the application programs and the 
operating system. 
	
✓	Accesses the contents of protected or encrypted files if possible and if 
legally appropriate. 

219
 Chapter 13: Bringing In Special Forces: Computer Forensics
	
✓	Analyzes all possibly relevant data found in inaccessible areas of a disk. 
This includes but is not limited to unallocated space on a disk (which is 
currently unused, but may be the repository of previous data that is rel­
evant evidence), as well as slack space in a file (the remnant area at the 
end of a file, in the last assigned disk cluster, that is unused by current 
file data, but may be a possible site for previously created and relevant 
evidence). 
	
✓	Provides an opinion of the system layout; the file structures discovered; 
any discovered data and authorship information; any attempts to hide, 
delete, protect, encrypt information; and anything else that has been 
discovered and appears to be relevant to the overall computer system 
examination. 
	
✓	Provides expert witness testimony. 
Following procedure
The series of processes in a computer forensic investigation is shown in

Authentication
Procedures performed by computer forensic experts include acquiring and 
preserving the ESI, then authenticating and analyzing it, after which the ESI 
is produced along with a report. All ESI on a storage medium is acquired in a 
forensically sound manner, which preserves the ESI from any material altera­
tion, so the ESI is in pristine condition. 
	
Except for the forensically sound manner, the steps in computer forensics 
and e-discovery are quite similar. Computer forensics methodologies meet 
the tough standards for criminal investigations, wherein the prosecutor must 
provide evidence showing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In civil cases, the 
plaintiff needs to show only that the defendant is liable by a preponderance of 
evidence. 

220
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
Computer forensics examinations may be part of e-discovery when exams are 
warranted by the facts of the case or by the law. Courts may allow forensic 
imaging of a hard drive or device if you show good cause. However, courts 
have been reluctant to order forensics exams largely because of the costs 
and burdens they inflict, but courts will order these exams if warranted. 
For example, in a 2007 trademark infringement action, Koninklijke Philips 
Electronics N.V. v. KXD Technology, the court ordered the defendant company 
to submit a report from a computer forensic expert explaining the circum­
stances surrounding the destruction of data, warning that the court might 
appoint a neutral computer forensic expert to verify the defendant’s claim.
Preparing for an investigation
If you’re not prepared and don’t have a plan, basically, you’re lost. A strong 
opponent will destroy you single-handedly. 
A forensic exam may be done voluntarily as a defensive move at the outset of 
a case and under your control. For an example of how this effort can be used 
as part of a defense, see the nearby sidebar about Williams v. Massachusetts 
Mutual Life Insurance Co. (2007). Or a court may order a forensic exam at any 
point in the case and assign a neutral expert, such as a Special Master, who 
has the technical and legal expertise to help the court resolve the parties’ 
disputes.
If the investigation is performed by a special master or someone hired by 
your opponent, you may need to sign a form prior to a forensic investigation 
of your company’s computers or other electronic media. Figure 13-2 shows a 
general reference guideline prepared by the United States Secret Service for 
consent forms pertaining to the search of computers and electronic media. 
The Secret Service recommends that you consult your district attorney 
or assistant U.S. attorney regarding consent language applicable to your 
jurisdiction.
Here’s how a forensic expert prepares for an investigation:
	
1.	Conduct interviews with IT staff members, archivists or records man­
agers, and data custodians. 
	
	 Your expert needs to find out and document as much as she can about 
responsive ESI and how it’s managed.
	
2.	Determine relevant time periods.
	
	 Start rigorously filtering down the volume of responsive ESI in a defen­
sive manner. 

221
 Chapter 13: Bringing In Special Forces: Computer Forensics
	
3.	 Learn which file types are relevant. 
	
	In forensics, experts determine a file’s type by looking into the file’s 
header and ignoring the file extension. This process also aids in the 
filtering-down procedure. 
	
4.	Identify key words, phrases, or concepts to be used as search terms 
for filtering. 
	
	 Queries that are written to search the forensic copy of the ESI use these 
terms. Your expert makes several passes through the ESI using various 
search filters.

You may have performed one or more of these steps during e-discovery. You 
might need to do some of the processes over because your opponent or the 
court was not satisfied with how you did them initially. Another reason for vol­
untarily performing these processes is to have a forensics copy for your own 
use. Not all of these steps are necessary in all cases. 
Computer forensic specialists sometimes investigate in extreme secrecy for 
a company, so other people don’t know exactly what they’re doing or what 
information they’ve unearthed.
Acquiring and preserving the image
In criminal cases, courts are fussy about evidence being in pristine condi­
tion. Not surprisingly, processing and searches are done on an exact physical 
duplicate of a hard drive, or a portion of one. The creation of a forensic copy 
is the acquisition. A forensic copy is the end product of a forensic acquisition 
of a computer’s hard drive or other storage device. A forensic copy is also 
called a bit-stream copy or image because it’s an exact bit-for-bit copy of the 
original document, file, partition, graphical image, or disk, for example. All 
metadata, file dates, slack areas, bad sectors — everything — are the same in 
the image as in their original forms. 
Building a defense
In an employment discrimination case 
against an insurance company, Williams v. 
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. 
(2007), the employee (Williams) filed a motion 
asking the court to appoint a neutral computer 
forensic expert. Williams requested that the 
expert inspect the company’s computer hard 
drives and e-mail system to recover an e-mail 
message from October 24, 2002, which he 
claimed existed. At his deposition, Williams tes­
tified that he had in his possession a hard copy 
of the e-mail message and that it described a 
discriminatory policy. (Later, when asked to 
produce the hard copy, Williams said that he 
couldn’t locate it.) 
The company opposed Williams’ motion 
because it was based on a flimsy speculation. 
The company also explained that the October 
24, 2002, “e-mail” being referred to was prob­
ably an October 24, 2002, memo from the senior 
vice president, which the company had pro­
duced and which did not describe any discrimi­
natory practices. The company went on to say 
that it had undertaken its own computer foren­
sic analysis, which failed to identify any e-mail 
message like the one Williams described. 
In the court’s view, Williams presented no cred­
ible evidence that his employer was unwilling to 
produce or had withheld relevant ESI. The court 
would not appoint a neutral computer forensics 
expert to help Williams confirm his speculation 
about a document he could not produce or 
verify the existence of.

 Chapter 13: Bringing In Special Forces: Computer Forensics
Acquisition isn’t the same as collecting or copying files from one storage 
medium to another. Examples of specialized forensics software tools 
are Kazeon (www.kazeon.com), Digital Intelligence (www.digital
intelligence.com), X-Ways WinHex (www.x-ways.net/winhex), X-Ways 
Forensics (www.x-ways.net/forensics), Paraben (www.paraben.com), 
EnCase (www.guidancesoftware.com), FTK (www.accessdata.com), 
and Nuix (www.nuix.com). Forensics tools are used to acquire the drive and 
create the image of that drive. A drive can be imaged without anyone viewing 
its contents. 
Acquiring a hard drive is like undergoing the carbonite freezing process that 
Han Solo went through. The ESI is preserved and can be safely transported.
	
You get only one shot to physically capture the first original image. If you even 
think you may need a forensic image in the future, nothing much is lost by 
spending a little more time to create it in the beginning.
Key benefits of creating forensic images include
	
✓	Preserving ESI in a generally accepted way.
	
✓	Having a working copy of the original to examine.
	
✓	Having multiple copies for examiners, decreasing the amount of time 
they need to complete examinations.
Authenticating with hash
As part of the acquisition process, the image is authenticated as an exact 
physical duplicate of the original. That authentication is necessary because the 
expert can’t investigate the original so the copy must be authenticated as an 
exact duplicate. But authentication of the forensic copy doesn’t authenticate 
the ESI itself, which you read in Chapter 12. Authentication of the ESI is done 
by the expert based on an analysis of various factors such as the content of 
ESI, when files and e-mails were created and by whom, other metadata such as 
when files were modified, attempts to hide or destroy data, and so forth.
As part of the imaging process, a forensic hash value (or hash for short) is 
calculated based on the contents of the image. The hash is a digital fingerprint 
that identifies the image, just as a human fingerprint identifies an individual. 
The hash is used for verification and authentication of file data, as well. 
In its simplest form, a hash algorithm adds up the assorted bits in a data 
string and provides a value. MD5 (Message Digest 5), SHA-1 (Secure Hash 
Algorithm 1), and SHA-256 are complex algorithms used to produce a forensic 
hash. MD5 checksums are 32-digit hexadecimal numbers, SHA-1 checksums 
are 40, and SHA-256 checksums are 64. Theoretically, there are 2128 possible 
MD5 hash values. Hash values are the proof that the original and forensic 

224
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
copies are identical, allowing the processing to be done on the image 
instead of the original. An example of an MD5 hash values is 
e0d321e5f316bef79bfdf5a008876577. An example of a SHA-1 hash is 
34821cfe609d3996f057252c45ec2156f5857806.
Recovering deleted ESI
Deleted ESI is typically considered to be not reasonably accessible. However, 
a computer system never actually deletes files, although they can be over­
written when the FAT uses the space for another file, so deleted ESI may 
be retrievable using computer forensics software and methodologies. Most 
documents, e-mail messages, log files of Internet activities, photos, and other 
file types can be analyzed without the application that produced them. 
Deleting ESI in an attempt to get rid of it is never a smart move because 
sanctions for spoliation (deliberate destruction of evidence) are not mild. 
The temptation to use software to wipe, scrub, or remove incriminating ESI 
from hard drives has driven people to make bad decisions. You can safely 
assume that wiping ESI during an ongoing investigation will be fatal to your 
case. Even if the files can’t be recovered and the scrubbing software’s been 
removed after use, the computer forensics expert is able to detect that the 
software had been installed and removed. 
In Kucala Enterprises, Ltd. v. Auto Wax Co., Inc. (2003), a patent dispute case, 
the defendant obtained a court order to inspect Kucala’s computer files. 
Owner John Kucala learned that Auto Wax planned to use EnCase forensic 
software to image and examine his computer. Kucala stalled the inspection 
for two months. Against his lawyer’s advice, the day before the inspection, 
Kucala installed Evidence Eliminator on his computer and eliminated an esti­
mated 15,000 files. The forensic investigation could not recover the files, but 
it could prove that Evidence Eliminator had been used the prior day. Kucala’s 
attempt to talk his way out of his self-created mess only further angered the 
judge who found that
“Any reasonable person can deduce, if not from the name of the product 
itself, then by reading the website, that Evidence Eliminator is a prod­
uct used to circumvent discovery. Especially telling is that the product 
claims to be able to defeat EnCase, the forensic imaging program used 
by Auto Wax to inspect Kucala’s computer. Kucala knew that Auto Wax 
planned on using the EnCase software, and he proceeded to install 
Evidence Eliminator anyway, even after he was advised by counsel not to 
use it.” 
Kucala not only lost the case, but also had to pay Auto Wax’s court and attor­
ney’s fees.

 Chapter 13: Bringing In Special Forces: Computer Forensics
Computer forensics software makes this retrieval of deleted files possible by 
converting all contents of a hard drive into a single searchable file — called 
an image — that is entirely accessible. As such, even files that have been 
deleted can be recovered and made available for review. The image is made 
to another hard drive or other storage media. After a hard drive is imaged, 
all work is performed on the image and never on the original, or non-forensic, 
copies of the original. Non-forensic copies of the original cannot be verified 
as exact duplicates of the original, so any challenge to the integrity of the 
analysis would succeed.
Analyzing to broaden or limit
A forensic image is, in effect, a single huge database file in which each file 
becomes a record. The forensic toolkit has superpowers to search using 
keyword or other searches to find responsive ESI. If a generally accepted 
forensic toolset is used, the results are considered verified if the person who 
performed the work is skilled in the software.
For unstructured ESI, such as e-mail and instant messages, disregard for 
spelling or the use of slang, abbreviations, or code complicates the search. 
To compensate, the search engines have features to help structure a query 
and catalog the results. Broadening searches and limiting searches are two 
types of search options to use with keywords or search terms.
Broadening searches
The following are search-broadening options:
	
✓	Stemming: Variations of the root of the search word are found. For 
example, the search for invest also finds investment.
	
✓	Synonyms: Synonyms of the search term are returned, like when you’re 
using a thesaurus. For example, crisis might also find problem.
	
✓	Homonyms: Words that sound the same (or similar) are found. For 
example, personnel also finds personal.
	
✓	Fuzziness: Different spellings of a word, misspellings, or variations 
involving digits are found. For example, a search for offshore also returns 
offshoor, and Rule 502 might find Rule 52.
	
	You can specify the degree of fuzziness, with 1 being the least fuzzy. 
Fuzzy search makes sense for first and last names, names of cities, com­
panies, and other proper nouns that are prone to typos or variations.

226
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
Limiting options
The following are search-limiting options:
	
✓	File size: You can limit the search to files of a certain size, or a range of 
file sizes.
	
✓	Date range: You can search within a range for when the file was created, 
accessed, or modified (CAM). Here’s what these time stamps mean:
	
• Create: Identifies the date and exact time, to the second, that the 
file was created on that particular storage media. The file’s Create 
time stamp changes whenever it’s copied to new media — even 
within the same storage device.
	
• Access: Specifies the last time the file was opened or accessed, but 
not changed in any form.
	
• Modify: Indicates the date and time that a file was modified 
or changed. On files that have been copied to new media, the 
Modified time stamps might be older than the Created time 
stamps. The reason is that the file in its original location had been 
modified before it was copied to the new location, thus created at 
a later date in the new location.
	
CAM time and date stamps are only as accurate as the time and date stored 
in the CMOS chip of the computer. The CMOS chip (which stands for 
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) is like an alarm clock that always 
knows the exact time, even when the power goes out. Like some alarm clocks, 
the CMOS chip is powered by an on-board battery — to retain all the informa­
tion necessary to start the computer properly. If something goes wrong with 
the onboard battery, the CMOS loses all these settings, which causes the 
computer to effectively lose its mind. Therefore, not checking this information 
makes it almost impossible to validate the accuracy of the times and dates 
associated with relevant computer files. You can check current time at this 
Web site: http://time.greenwich2000.com. 
Expressing in Boolean
You can combine search options to broaden or restrict results using Boolean 
searching. 
Boolean searching uses connecting words to develop a search expression. 
Anyone familiar with online database searches is familiar with this type of 
query. Here are standard connectors to form a search expression:
	
✓	and narrows the search by requiring that the file contains more than 
one search word. For example, new and client and commission returns 
files containing all three of those words. 

227
 Chapter 13: Bringing In Special Forces: Computer Forensics
	
✓	or expands the search by broadening the resulting set of files. Files that 
contain any of the words are found. In effect, using the or connector in a 
single search (for example, client or customer or buyer) is like doing three 
separate searches (one search for client, one for customer, and another 
search for buyer) at once. 
	
✓	and not subtracts files that have the specified word in it. For example, in 
a search with the terms and not customer, files containing customer are 
excluded from the search results. 
	
	When using the search expression and not, make sure it’s the last con­
nector in the search expression because whatever follows it is going to 
be excluded!
When combined, these operators may become much more powerful than a 
non-Boolean search. But a mistake in the formation of the expression can 
throw off the results. 
	
The order in which the expression is processed is based on the connector. It 
isn’t simply processed from left to right. 
The software organizes the files according to categories or status such as the 
following:
	
✓	E-mail messages
	
✓	Documents
	
✓	Spreadsheets
	
✓	Databases
	
✓	Graphics
	
✓	Executables
	
✓	Folders
	
✓	Slack space
	
✓	Encrypted files
	
✓	Deleted files
	
✓	Files from the Recycle Bin or Trash
	
✓	Data carvings or data-carved files
You can view contents of files regardless of whether they were deleted, 
unless they were also overwritten. Data carving tools search through unallo­
cated space on the storage medium looking for remnants of a file by search­
ing for headers of known file types. The remnants are blocks of data, which 
are called carved files. Because the files no longer exist even as deleted files, 
what’s left of them is carved out of that space.

228
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
	
A computer forensics examination can be limited to specific devices or hard 
drives of key custodians. It doesn’t need to be performed on every device or 
hard drive. 
Producing and documenting in detail
The forensic toolkit has reporting capabilities that generate reports in vari­
ous levels of detail, with some becoming extremely detailed. 
Forensic software’s reporting engine allows you to create detailed reports 
and output them into the following formats (also called protocols), or others, 
with links back to the original evidence:
	
✓	Native format: Files as they existed on the media with metadata intact.
	
✓	HTML: HyperText Markup Language is the protocol of the Internet. 
HTML files can be opened and read in any Web browser. 
	
✓	PDF: Portable Document Format is a convenient, popular, and well-
supported format for publishing documents. 
	
✓	XML: eXtensible Markup Language is a universal data format that’s used 
to allow data export to virtually any IT system. Like HTML, this format 
uses tags to identify the data. 
	
✓	TIFF: Tagged Image File Format is widely used to archive documents and 
photos when maximum quality is important.
	
✓	RTF: Rich Text Format is a file format standardized by Microsoft for cre­
ating formatted text files. It’s a universal format, meaning it can be read 
by nearly all word processors.
You can save reports to a CD or DVD with hyperlinks to supporting informa­
tion that’s contained on the CD or DVD. This effective, self-contained method 
makes it easy to deliver necessary reports and supporting documentation.
Reporting procedures are important to the success of the case. The investiga­
tor performing or participating in the investigation may be required to testify 
in court, so all procedures need to be documented. The following recommen­
dations help ensure proper documentation: 
	
✓	All reports of the investigation should be prepared with the under­
standing that they will be read by others. Authorities, opposing coun­
sel, the court, the press, and the general public might read the report. 
	
✓	The investigator should never comment on the guilt or innocence of a 
suspect or suspects or their affiliations. Only the facts of the investiga­
tion should be presented, and opinions should be avoided. 

229
 Chapter 13: Bringing In Special Forces: Computer Forensics
Reinforcing E-Discovery
Computer forensics can support e-discovery in recovery and also in
	
✓	Finding ESI. Computer forensics can get into the computer’s registry 
to find what software has been installed, or it can scan slack space to 
find out what’s been done or written. A common reaction to seeing 
what computer forensics can find and recover is “wow.” That’s followed 
quickly by delight, relief, or panic. 
	
✓	Providing plausible interpretations of what the facts demonstrate. 
Facts are easy to find, such as which Web sites someone visited or what 
was typed in a chat room. But analyzing the facts to interpret what they 
mean is much more difficult. Analysis of these facts or clues to figure out 
why someone visited those particular Web sites requires more critical 
thinking and hypothesis testing. Investigators’ abilities to interpret what 
those facts mean, or could mean, depend on their technical expertise 
and competence. 
	
✓	Examining the opposing counsel’s e-evidence for alternative interpre­
tations. ESI can support conflicting theories. An unbiased investigator 
may interpret and draw inferences supported by the messages, files, or 
other ESI that differ from those of the opposing side. 
	
✓	Assessing the strength of the ESI in support of or against a party. This 
is a key benefit to gain from computer forensics. This information and 
advice allows you to decide whether to negotiate or to litigate on (as in 
party on). Having this knowledge at the meet-and-confer session can be a 
hefty bargaining chip. 
Depending on the case, you may want to involve a computer forensics expert 
to avoid or at least decrease the risk of charges that you haven’t produced 
ESI in good faith. You can see the logic of this approach. With e-discovery, 
data custodians may be the ones who self-identify and self-collect the poten­
tially responsive ESI. In contrast, computer forensics investigators collect 
everything from a storage device and follow strict evidence handling proto­
cols that document each step in preserving the chain of custody of the ESI. 
Of course, if a laptop or other computer is withheld from the expert, the 
problem has gone full circle. Computer forensics experts also can assist in 
handling e-discovery issues, such as providing technical specifications for 
discovery or devising search strategies in a neutral capacity.
Fighting against forensic fishing attempts
You’ve seen TV detectives desperately wanting to enter and search a per­
son’s car or apartment, but they couldn’t without probable cause. Without 
probable cause, they’d be on a fishing expedition — trying to find evidence to 

230
Part V: Getting Litigation Ready 
justify having broken into the car or apartment. The same principle applies to 
forensics. You can’t use forensics to find out whether there’s any incriminat­
ing e-mail or other ESI that simply “suspect” or believe must be in there. 
Forensic fishing expeditions won’t be allowed by the courts because showing 
both a good cause and a reasonable need are requirements. Good cause usu­
ally arises from suspicious circumstances that suggest spoliation, such as a 
story of a midnight hacker erasing all of your files or the loss of a laptop with 
all of your records just before a deposition. Generally, courts order full foren­
sic copies of hard drives only if they have a good cause that’s supported 
by specific, concrete evidence of the alteration or destruction of electronic 
information.
In a case involving the theft of trade secrets (Ameriwood Ind., Inc. v. 
Liberman, 2006), the court gave the employer (the requesting party) 
access to its employee’s computer to recover ESI that was not reasonably 
accessible. The court allowed the company to make a forensic copy of the 
employee’s computer and search for otherwise inaccessible ESI, the deleted 
files, and slack space because the company demonstrated the need for the 
forensics. 
Fighting with forensics on your team
An investment in computer forensics can help your company prove that 
something did or did not happen. Computer forensics can reduce legal fees 
by bringing a case to resolution more quickly than it would have ended 
otherwise.
In another employment case, the employee brought an Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act (ERISA) action alleging that her employer fired her in 
unlawful retaliation for her complaints about the employer’s failure to make 
timely contributions to her retirement account. The employee contended her 
firing took place in part because she met with an attorney and the employer 
had used a spyware program to review her e-mail to learn about the meeting. 
The employer acknowledged installing the spyware program on employee 
computers, but denied using the program. To aid in its defense, the employer 
hired a computer forensics expert to analyze forensic images of hard drives 
of the employee’s business and personal computers. The results of this inves­
tigation proved that the spyware program had been deleted from the employ­
ee’s business computer by antivirus software before the spyware copied 
any keystrokes or saved any screen shots. The court granted the employer’s 
motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case.

231
 Chapter 13: Bringing In Special Forces: Computer Forensics
Defending In-Depth
The forensic investigator, working as a neutral expert or special master for 
the court or hired by one of the parties, must be able to defend her methods, 
interpretations, inferences, and conclusions. Maintaining the integrity of the 
ESI as e-evidence requires a standardized, defensible approach to data han­
dling, preservation, and analysis. 
The opposition will try to find mistakes in the forensic investigation. Your 
defense should include evidence that one or more of the following docu­
mented procedures have been performed. Documentation needs to show 
that the investigator
	
✓	Acquired the e-evidence without altering or damaging the source.
	
✓	Authenticated the acquired e-evidence by verifying that it was the same 
as the original.
	
✓	Analyzed the data and files without altering them.
	
✓	Used systematic sampling techniques that included agreed upon key­
words, phrases, concepts, date ranges, and file types.
Also, as part of the defensive strategy, the work must be
	
✓	Performed in accordance with forensic science principles.
	
✓	Based on current industry best practices.
	
✓	Conducted with verified tools to identify, collect, filter, “bag and tag,” 
store, and preserve e-evidence.
	
✓	Documented thoroughly and in detail.

Success

In this part . . .
T
his sixth part helps make you a master of e-discovery 
from four perspectives. In Chapter 14, you find out 
about the latest in archiving business records and how it 
differs from data backups. You see the impact of the deci­
sion to do archiving within the framework of the Zubulake 
five categories of data, which you read about in Chapter 2. 
You learn a proactive approach to information manage­
ment based on an enforced policy and how such an 
approach can put you in a position of strength when 
e-discovery hits. 
In Chapter 15, we switch views from internal to external. 
You see e-discovery from the perspective of the judges 
and what they have in their toolkit to encourage parties to 
play fair and dissuade gamesmanship.  
For large-scale, high-stakes, or unusual cases, you may 
find that the case cannot be resolved and you’re headed 
for trial, as you read in Chapter 16. You discover the value 
of partnering with one or more e-discovery vendors 
whose expertise you need.
Chapter 17 covers e-discovery from the small end of the 
continuum. Even when there’s a $15,000 contract in dis­
pute or a $50,000 fraud charge, ESI may be the star wit­
ness. You discover how proportionality principles and 
computer forensics techniques influence these cases.

C
hanneling the flood of documents and messages rolling through your 
company into an archive or into a discard bin is a critical step toward 
being ready for litigation. Ad hoc e-mail management, for example, can lead 
to legal disputes or outright disasters. Early case assessments can be done 
with confidence only when active and archived electronic business records 
can be found, collected, and put on litigation hold on-demand (read that 
quickly and easily). What the e-discovery team needs from IT is well-managed 
ESI that makes it as simple as (economically) possible to identify and pre­
serve responsive ESI. That level of simplicity is never going to happen unless 
you’ve indexed, classified, and categorized the ESI so that it’s process-ready 
and legal-review–ready; and expired ESI is banished on cue. In practical 
terms, investing in tech solutions to achieve e-discovery zen may seem cost-
prohibitive . . . that is, until you’ve faced the fire for being unprepared. 
In this chapter, you read about IT’s role in litigation-readiness. That role is 
following proper electronic records management (ERM) and implementing 
the policies, practices, and software to make it happen. You find out why lay­
ering ERM software on top of bad practices simply automates bad practices. 
Simplicity and certainty are the antidotes to chaos and complexity. Simplicity 
here means automation because the less human effort needed to manage ESI 
and ensure compliance, the better. For processes that you can’t automate, 
you cover those gaps with data retention and disposal policies and proce­
dures that provide users with the certainty to know what to do, what not do, 
and what will happen when policies are violated.

236
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Ratcheting Up IT’s Role in Prelitigation
Managing ESI is not only a technology matter. It’s one of the most serious 
sources of legal exposure and risk your company may face. In the race for rev­
enue, it’s tempting for managers to overlook legal risks even though the price 
for not being prelitigation-ready has been paid by numerous companies. 
Corporate records management policies and practices are now under great 
scrutiny thanks to the incidents of massive and hugely stupid attempts to 
get rid of evidence by document shredding and deleting. These incidents 
have created a new environment in which electronic records retention and 
destruction decisions are judged more harshly. 
Laying the cornerstone of ERM
Records management, either paper or electronic, includes the creation, 
retention, continued access, and discarding and destruction of business 
records. The cornerstone of a defensible ESI management system and 
e-discovery protocol is a well-designed (or reasonable in legalese) ERM policy 
and program. ERM policies and programs do double duty in terms of manag­
ing the likelihood and the impact of litigation risk. They do the following:
	
✓	Minimize or reduce risk associated with the case. You’ve heard the 
cliché that information is power. Against your opponent in a lawsuit, you 
don’t have much else. ESI is the negotiating tool or bargaining chip — a 
situation that moved ERM from a back-office task to a business-critical 
function for which IT has a major responsibility. ERM helps prevent the 
risk of not being able to prepare a powerful position for the meet-and-
confer session. Or not being able to show your opponent that you’re 
ready to respond to whatever they throw at you. 
	
✓	Transfer or offset risk associated with the court. ERM helps minimize 
the risk associated with not being able to fulfill the duty to preserve 
when litigation strikes or is reasonably foreseeable. Taking early preven­
tative measures by implementing an ERM designed with e-discovery in 
mind saves you legal grief down the road. Risk skyrockets for companies 
with sloppy prelitigation ERM practices. Having a rock-solid ERM pro­
gram is like insurance to offset risk. When challenged, you have the ERM 
defense to save your hide.

Pitching your tent before the storm
The left side of the Electronic Digital Rights Management (EDRM) diagram 
(shown in Figure 14-1) is broadly called information management. For e-
discovery purposes, this is the prelitigation or presubpoena stage when your 
company is operating its business as usual, continually producing ESI and 
using it to do business.

VOLUME
RELEVANCE
According to a 2009 e-discovery survey report published by HP, 51 percent 
of respondents chose to improve the information management stage through 
technology. However, many ERM programs don’t adequately deal with the 
requirements of this stage. When IT doesn’t take into account how their pro­
grams impact the volume and accessibility of ESI, it’s possible that no one 
will know — until a lawsuit comes up. If there’s validity to the quote “adven­
ture is just bad planning,” plenty of adventure is in store for the e-discovery 
team.
The amended Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) exposed the weak­
nesses in many companies’ ERM policies and programs. Most likely, ERM 
problems were known, but so what? The cost to fix the problems was too 
high until e-discovery rules changed the status quo. As every application 
developer and network administrator knows, it’s not until software programs, 
policies, or networks are tested rigorously in a realistic situation that defi­
ciencies and unexpected performance are detected.
	
If you don’t have an ERM policy and program in place that are designed to 
meet litigation demands, you’ll undoubtedly get in trouble sooner or later. 
We’re talking very costly fines, sanctions, and lost judgments, and not gentle 
tap-on-the-wrist reprimands. And if your ERM schedule is hit or miss, the 
court may order a computer forensic expert to find, audit, and report on your 
ESI; and order your company to pay the bill. Face it, for IT, there’s no escaping 
a key role in prelitigation. For IT departments, adding a litigation focus to their 
business focus is their destiny.

238
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Telling Documents and Business 
Records Apart
ESI is a new term. Documents and business records are not. Although these 
terms are used rather generally, you need to use them more precisely when 
discussing their management. 
Not every e-mail, instant message, memo, photo, PDF, word processing file, 
or other type of file is a business record. A business record is any document 
that records a business dealing, operation, or transaction. Much more com­
plex definitions are tossed around, but this simple definition captures it all. 
For example, if e-mail is used in any way to transact business, it’s a business 
record that must be kept for a period defined by law — usually seven years. 
The e-mails are evidence of business transactions or contracts, as well as 
evidence of changes to quarterly financial statements or a labor contract. 
Federal and state laws may mandate that the e-mails and their metadata and 
attachments be saved as business records. 
Figure 14-2 shows the useful distinction between documents and records. 
Documents are under the control of the person (user) who created or 
received them. The user can save, send, delete, edit, or tag the document 
for retention or destruction according to a document management policy. 
Typically these actions take place without much hands-on control from IT. 
Control via policies. An e-mail policy may direct employees to empty their 
e-mail inboxes and voice-mail boxes at regular intervals; or direct them to 
clear out early versions of memos or documents and tag the final version for 
retention as a business record. You can read about policies and enforcement 
in the section “Building an ERM Program.”
Having document management policies that require employees to regularly 
purge their personal digital stuff and tag documents to keep as business 
records does a few good things:
	
✓	Spares you from having to go through megabytes of non-records looking 
for two or three files or e-mails.
	
✓	Protects you against spoliation accusations.
	
✓	Defends you if you inadvertently destroy ESI. Your defense would be 
something like this: 
	
	“We had reasonable policies and procedures that we followed. Despite 
our best efforts, our system isn’t perfect.”
	
	Taking an honest approach goes a long way with the court.

Documents that generally don’t need to be saved as business records include 
personal e-mails sent or received on the company’s e-mail system, personal 
files of all types, earlier drafts of documents, memos about company picnics 
or other events, and items posted on the company’s Intranet (such as “free 
puppies to good home”).
At some point, as shown in Figure 14-2, documents that are business records 
need to be retained, and come under the centralized control of your com­
pany. Contracts, financial reports, proprietary information, quality control 
documentation, project management records, human resource reports, and 
the like are business records. These records are destroyed when there’s no 
legal or business reason to retain them any longer.
	
The two primary professional organizations dedicated to records and informa­
tion management are ARMA International (Association for Records Managers 
and Administrators), whose Web site is www.arma.org, and AIIM (the 
Association for Information and Image Management), whose Web site is www.
aiim.org. They provide publications, information, and educational programs 
on records management for both paper and electronic records.

Designing a Defensible ERM Program
Standard out-of-the-box ERM programs simply don’t exist anymore than stan­
dard off-the-shelf information security programs (firewalls, access control 
lists, or intrusion detection systems) exist. You start with the basic require­
ments or functions and then customize from there. 
In the following sections, we discuss how to start designing your ERM pro­
gram. When you have it designed, you can then build it, which we discuss in 
the “Building an ERM Program” section.
Designing by committee
Your team that’s responsible for defining the ERM policies, retention sched­
ules, requirements, and enforcement methods should include IT, legal, 
human resource, records managers, and business stakeholders. This team 
may also be the e-discovery response team, or at least some members should 
be common to both teams. Your company has numerous constraints to take 
into consideration, such as state and local laws, industry and federal regula­
tions, resource and privacy restraints, information flows, and capabilities of 
existing systems.
Politics or personal agendas of team members can divert or waste effort. 
Having a manager with power encourages cooperation and keeps the focus 
on the overall ERM agenda. 
	
You want an ERM that collects the least amount of ESI that’s legally defensible 
while meeting your business’ operational needs and regulatory obligations.
Starting with the basics
Designing a defensible ERM program (also called records and information 
management, or RIM) starts with recognizing a wonderfully binary situation: 
keep or not keep. Here’s how you start:
	
1.	Distinguish records from non-records.
	
2.	Get rid of the non-records and leave the business records that must be 
retained.

241
 Chapter 14: Managing and Archiving Business Records
	
	 Saving everything is never an effective ERM program because the 
volume of data becomes too overwhelming to control ESI. Hoarding has 
downsides:
 
• Hurts your ability to manage business records
 
• Adds to storage costs unnecessarily because you’re keeping non-
records 
 
• Exposes records to review costs that you shouldn’t have
	
3.	Categorize the business records and apply retention schedules to 
records you need to keep.
	
	 Set retention periods for every category of business record based on 
federal rules, industry regulation, or other authority. 
	
4.	 Dispose of records as scheduled.
	
	 You face this paradox — ESI can exist on an IT system forever and yet 
not be accessible when you need it. Records that you don’t need to keep 
any longer need to be cleaned out of your company’s digital landfills as 
soon as possible. If you don’t get rid of records as scheduled, you may 
be forced to keep them. Why? Because once the retention period for 
records has passed, if a litigation hold is imposed, you’re stuck preserv­
ing those records. And if that’s not enough pain, you may need to pro­
duce them if requested. 
	
	 You’re biggest retention regret is likely to be from over-retained e-mail. 
E-mail is the number one source of evidence used to compel early settle­
ments and they’re the root cause of large sanctions. Destroying e-mail is 
challenging because it’s not truly gone unless every copy of it is gone.
	
The Department of Defense (DoD) established records management standards 
that are named DoD 5015. ERM software vendors whose products are certified 
for DoD 5015 qualify for use by federal government agencies. When evaluating 
ERM software, look for that certification.
You should set retention and disposition schedules based on legal or other 
mandates. For example, documents or e-mails that are archived into a finan­
cial documents folder may be disposed of in seven years. Environmental 
or health-related documents get lifetime storage. Any automated system to 
purge ESI is fine, as long as there’s a way to turn it off when a litigation hold 
is imposed.
	
Don’t write a policy and then forget about it. The courts consider that at least 
as bad as not having a policy. You can’t download a sample policy, slap on the 
company logo, and think you’re protected.

Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Getting management on board 
with your ERM program
Most companies don’t have well-defined ERM policies and programs in place 
to control their data growth. That’s because their ERM policies/programs 
aren’t updated or executed with e-discovery duties in mind. Companies 
aren’t known to sprint to meet requirements set by what seems like (or actu­
ally is) an endless stream of regulations (regs, for short). Privacy, security, 
anti-terrorism, fraud, the do-not-call registry, bankruptcy, foreign corrupt 
practices, the environment, and other government regs are very demand­
ing and invariably drop more work on the IT department than is possible to 
implement properly within the time limits. An ERM policy is just one more 
thing to do.
When the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed in 2002 that gave public companies 
a compliance deadline for automating strict internal controls over financial 
reporting (the Act had an anti-manual spirit to it), the series of delays by 
the companies and extensions by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
rivaled those of the airlines during bad weather. Managers may be condi­
tioned to expect extensions or reprieves and thus not see any urgency in 
investing in ERM, particularly in a bad economy.
IT investments tend to be earmarked for profit-generating activities, like 
increasing sales and new product development. In order for compliance-
related items to get their fair share of the budget, you need help from 
above — top management. 
When senior management strongly supports the ERM project by committing 
to a healthy budget and sufficient resources, it can be successful. Senior man­
agement’s commitment to success needs to be visible, just like monitoring, to 
keep employees compliant. The basic principle here is that what’s important 
gets done. 
IT managers surveyed on e-discovery
A LiveOffice survey, conducted by Osterman 
Research in 2007, polled more than 400 IT 
managers and users across the United States. 
According to the results, 63 percent of respon­
dents had faced a legal action requiring them 
to produce e-mail. Fifty three percent said 
they weren’t prepared to meet the amended 
FRCP, while 30 percent weren’t even aware of 
the FRCP requirements. IT managers felt that 
responding to e-discovery requests only slightly 
less painful than dealing with the IRS.

243
 Chapter 14: Managing and Archiving Business Records
Conversely, without senior management, you’re finished. Any unpopular 
project, such as information security, will fail if users know that it’s not a top 
priority at their company. 
Another influencing factor is management’s attitude toward risk or risk appe­
tite. Risk appetite is the amount of risk — on a broad level — management is 
willing to accept. The bigger the appetite, the less chance you have of getting 
all the funding you need. 
	
Emphasize the prelitigation readiness angle when convincing upper manage­
ment of your ERM. If there’s one thing that can capture executive attention, 
it’s litigation. It’s no coincidence that companies that have been through 
e-discovery and litigation at least once are more receptive to implementing 
ERM, particularly retention and disposition policies.
Some statistics might move the budget in your direction. A company can 
spend an average of $18 to $19 million to produce and review 1 terabyte (TB) 
of data. If only 10 percent of that TB should have been cleared out, almost $2 
million is spent reviewing ESI that should have been disposed of.
	
Playing the cost-reduction card with IT investments needs to be done with 
extreme care. You may want to boost your budget by claiming that in addition 
to mitigating legal risk, ERM can drive down costs and improve operational 
efficiencies. If that argument is almost threadbare at your company, tread 
gently on those extras.
Not ready for prime e-discovery time
In Fall 2008, Kahn Consulting, Inc., in association 
with ARMA International, BNA Digital Discovery 
and E-Evidence, Business Trends Quarterly, 
and the Society of Corporate Compliance and 
Ethics, surveyed over 400 enterprises on three 
information management compliance topics. 
The three topics were governance, risk man­
agement, and compliance (GRC); records and 
information management (RIM); and e-discov­
ery. Key findings of the survey include
	✓	Over 90 percent are actively addressing 
GRC, RIM, and e-discovery issues.
	✓	Fewer than 25 percent believe that their 
employees understand their GRC, RIM, and 
e-discovery responsibilities and how to ful­
fill them.
	✓	Only 15 percent of employees understand 
their legal hold and e-discovery responsi­
bilities.
	✓	Only 21 percent understand how informa­
tion should be retained and disposed.

Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Crafting a risk-reducing policy
Your company probably has acceptable use policies (AUP) as well as other 
types of policies in place. For your ERM policy to withstand scrutiny, it must 
meet several characteristics that include the following:
	
✓	Written in language that employees can understand easily: If the 
employee needs a law or computer science degree to understand it, it 
won’t pass as a policy. 
	
✓	Recognizes the demands placed on individuals: If the do’s and don’ts 
are too harsh for employees to comply with, they won’t. With overly 
strict policies, users find ways to outsmart the rules. Anyone who’s 
tried to implement strong password controls knows that creative and 
lazy employees are quick to figure out workarounds, such as not turn­
ing off the computer or writing passwords on sticky notes attached to 
the monitor.
	
✓	Circulated to employees: Employees need to understand what’s 
expected of them. If employees don’t see the value of compliance, don’t 
know of any downside to non-compliance, or are not trained to comply, 
the policy is considered optional, at best. Some employees won’t want 
to part with any of their e-mails.
	
✓	Available online so everyone knows where they are and you can 
update them easily. Make it easy for employees to find the policy and 
contact information of the point person for questions. Include an FAQ 
section so they don’t need you or the help desk to get answers.
	
✓	Simple enough to enforce consistently: If the policy has exceptions and 
exclusions (like the rules of evidence) and other complexities, they can’t 
be implemented or won’t survive for long because they sap productivity. 
	
When drafting policies, remember that everything that you’ve preserved auto­
matically becomes discoverable in the event of litigation — whether or not 
you intended it to be.
To claim in court that ESI isn’t available because it’s been destroyed, you have 
to back up that claim with a written ERM policy and proof that it’s been distrib­
uted and agreed to. Keep records that demonstrate how the policy is imple­
mented and how employees are trained in retention and disposal. You also 
need electronic log files showing that disposal is applied uniformly, on sched­
ule, and according to the written policy. Document all ERM efforts as though 
you’re preparing to testify in court about the policy and how it’s enforced.

245
 Chapter 14: Managing and Archiving Business Records
Punching up your e-mail policy
E-mail plays a big role in creating risk, so e-mail policies play a big role in 
reducing risk. Yet many companies get that simple relationship wrong. 
Companies have paid large fines and corporate officers being prosecuted 
because their employees misused e-mail. According to the market research 
firm IDC (www.idc.com), 27 percent of Fortune 500 companies have had to 
deal with harassment claims concerning e-mail. In one case, a major consult­
ing company was sued by one of its former employees for $3.5 million over an 
alleged defamatory job remark. The employee requested copies of all e-mail 
records containing his name going back ten years. Of course, the company 
objected that the request was too burdensome by showing that the retrieval 
would cost $7.8 million to search 61 backups, and the court agreed. 
Issuing policies is like popping diet pills. You need to do more to get last­
ing and effective results. Here are some things you can do to bolster e-mail 
policy to reduce the volume of e-mail and risk of misuse:
	
✓	Create a big presence. Many times, when a company simply announces 
e-mail monitoring, behavior changes. It’s like driving on the highway 
with a state trooper right behind. Preventing nonsense in the first place 
saves the most amount of grief.
	
✓	Monitor for compliance and to detect trends. IT can see behavior pat­
terns and suspicious trends that need a closer look. In order to see 
what’s going on, you need to combine a detection system similar to an 
intrusion detection system (IDS). You want the system to flag e-mail sent 
with large attachments or to too many recipients, sending huge volumes 
of e-mails to free e-mail accounts, and sending confidential files to the 
sender’s personal e-mail account. Basically, you’re making potential 
problems visible so you can investigate and take corrective action.
	
✓	Perform investigations quickly and carefully. The IT department typi­
cally performs the investigations of employee e-mail misuse. But you 
may want to check with legal or HR first because of employees’ right to 
privacy. 
	
✓	Keep it transparent. Personal e-mail archives complicate e-discovery 
because they’re not under centralized control. Allowing users to save 
messages on their own, outside of the ERM system and established 
policies, leads to too many pocket-archives whose contents you can see 
Collecting ESI from pocket archives is time-consuming and has disaster 
written all over it. 
	
✓	Manage the policy and violators. You can see which policies are being 
broken and who’s breaking them. Violators need to face the conse­
quences listed in the policy, or your policy has a giant gap. 

246
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
	
✓	Keep the capture of e-mail tagged as legal records simple and easy. 
Invest in applications that take the guesswork and the work itself out 
of the hands of the users. Your e-mail archive is only as complete as 
the users are conscientious, which is alarming. For example, e-mail 
archiving systems let you define role-based and/or information-based 
retention policies. Users can tag or drag their e-mail to a folder where 
it’s later classified. Customer e-mail could be dropped into a customer 
folder, from which the archiving system applies the appropriate reten­
tion policy.
	
	Some intelligent (and more expensive) archiving systems offer a wide 
variety of tagging rules that you can customize to meet your company’s 
retention rules. Tagging rules (that is, actions that are carried out based 
on the tag) make life easier for you and make retention consistent. 
When building or updating your ERM program, here are two universal prin­
ciples to guide your efforts: 
	
✓	If you can’t classify it, you can’t manage it.
	
✓	To produce it, you must preserve it. 
Building an ERM Program
Building an ERM program follows a process. The steps in that process are:
	
1.	Conduct an inventory to determine the kinds of records or informa­
tion created and used.
	
2.	Develop a classification scheme for grouping records into classes.
	
	 A class consists of similar records that are related as the result of being 
created, received, or used in the same activity or function.
	
3.	Prepare a records retention schedule to set retention periods (times) 
for the various classes of records.
	
	 A retention period is the length of time a given record series is retained 
for administrative, legal, and historical reasons. A retention schedule is 
a set of policies and procedures that identify and describe how records 
are treated.
	
	 The records retention schedule needs to take into consideration these 
four criteria:

247
 Chapter 14: Managing and Archiving Business Records
 
• Business needs: Your company’s future need for records, including 
who needs access to the records and for how long.
 
• Regulatory requirements: You don’t get the option of negotiating 
time frames under the control of federal, state, and local laws. 
Consider how agreeable the IRS would be if you choose not to 
retain records for tax purposes. 
 
• Documentation for legal purposes: Your company has more legal 
documents than you may have thought. There are contracts, 
agreements, warranties, patents, deeds, and titles. These are legal 
documents, but they’re not required by regulations.
 
• Litigation: Here’s the e-discovery reason. You retain and preserve 
ESI that might be needed to prove or defend a case. Considerations 
include the cost of accessing, processing, and reviewing docu­
ments, even those retained beyond their retention schedule. 
	
4.	Design a prototype or pilot ERM program to test functionality and user 
acceptance and debug.
	
	 Your ERM program needs to cover the ESI lifecycle. Stages in that life­
cycle are
 
• Creation
 
• Distribution
 
• Retention
 
• Protection 
 
• Discard or destroy
 
• Suspension of discard and destroy when there’s an anticipated or 
active investigation, or a litigation hold
	
5.	Prepare the following written documentation about the policy. 
	
	 You’ll notice that it’s similar to an insurance policy, which is not riveting 
reading either. 
 
• Purpose and scope
 
• Responsibilities of officers, managers, and employees
 
• Coverage and conditions that create exceptions
 
• Retention periods for documents
 
• Destruction times, methods, and responsibilities
	
6.	Implement the ERM program, train employees, monitor compliance, 
and keep it updated.

248
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Technology solutions are available for managing e-mail, such as e-mail 
archiving tools for managing and preserving e-mail and analytic programs for 
searching archived e-mails. You may want to read The Sedona Conference’s 
Commentary on E-mail Management: Guidelines for the Selection of Retention 
Policy published in April 2007. You can download the publication from the 
Sedona Conference’s Web site at www.thesedonaconference.org. 
A 2007 IDG survey reports that the worldwide market for e-mail archiving 
applications grew by 45 percent in 2006 and is expected to approach $1.4 bil­
lion in 2011.
Kicking the keep-it-all habit
Consider your closets or the glove compartment in your vehicle. When 
you’re paying lawyers hundreds of dollars an hour to review e-mail and docu­
ments, a smaller pile means a smaller bill. That’s your incentive to monitor 
and enforce policy. Likewise, people will retain many more files and e-mails 
when there’s little incentive to get rid of it.
Doing what you say you are
When a company has a policy that it isn’t following, what it has done is define its 
own standard of care that it’s failing to meet. If your opponent can show that you 
say one thing but do another, you’re well on your way to losing your case.
If you explain to the court something such as, “We don’t have e-mail mes­
sages sent by the employees listed below prior to July 2007,” the courts gen­
erally accept that situation when it’s supported by a statement from someone 
in IT explaining retention and disposition policies and practices. A court isn’t 
likely to make you prove a negative unless you have done something that put 
you on the wrong side of the court.
Good recordkeeping that includes archive dates cannot be fully appreciated 
until you need to defend the loss of ESI. Imagine the difference between being 
fully prepared with all documentation needed for an IRS audit and having to 
scramble for documentation.

 Chapter 14: Managing and Archiving Business Records
Getting an A+ in Compliance
When you’re producing ESI, you must comply with the rule (specifically 
with FRCP 34(b)(2)(E)(i)) that deals with producing documents in the usual 
course of business. You show compliance with that rule by
	
✓	Providing information about where the documents were maintained
	
✓	Identifying who maintained the documents
	
✓	Identifying the sources of the information
When you have to produce e-mails in the usual course of business, you show 
compliance by
	
✓	Arranging the responsive e-mails by custodian
	
✓	Sorting them in chronological order 
	
✓	Including any attachments.
For non–e-mail ESI, you show compliance by
	
✓	Producing the files by custodian
	
✓	Identifying the file’s location on the hard drive by identifying each file’s
 
• Directory
 
• Subdirectory
 
• Filename

cation, as Twitter and YouTube have done, you need to support a broader 
range of content types.

Chapter 15
Viewing e-Discovery Law 
from the Bench
In This Chapter
▶	Judging issues still not settled
▶	Analyzing the role of the judge 
R
ules applicable to discovery are nothing new. What is new is the format 
of the information sought. The explosion of electronic information has 
led to an expanding and still-developing area of discovery law. The courts 
are often faced with the dilemma of deciding whether the old square peg for 
discovery fits in the new round hole for electronic discovery. They find it 
usually doesn’t. In the world of e-discovery, federal judges have become the 
darlings of the legal process, the superstars of the legal community, by craft­
ing new decisions that pertain specifically to e-discovery.
In legal cases, judges make determinations of law, and juries make deter­
minations of fact. Electronic discovery involves legal issues and therefore 
is the province of the judges. In most cases on the federal level, the mag­
istrate judges set the course of e-discovery with the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedures (FRCP) for guidance.
Because judges have such an important role in e-discovery, looking to them 
for insight into the process can be helpful. A judge’s insight can aid you in 
making decisions and set a course during your e-discovery process. In this 
chapter, you find out about how some influential judges view their role in the 
process of e-discovery. You gain a valuable perspective on some currently 
vexing issues that you may get involved with during e-discovery.

252
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Examining Unsettled and 
Unsettling Issues
The court system is so swamped with e-discovery matters that you may 
find going to trial is too expensive for what your case is worth. Some of 
the expense is due to judges who fail to control excessive and expensive 
e-discovery. In an effort to control costs, judges look to the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure (FRCP) to force a settlement rather than move your case for­
ward. The costs associated with e-discovery can be mind-boggling. In Oracle 
Corporation, et al., v. SAP AG, et al., the parties were in a dispute over pos­
sible discovery of 165 custodians of potentially relevant ESI. The estimated 
cost of discovery for those 165 was $16.5 million.
	
The general rule is that if you’re responding to the discovery request, you 
bear the cost of production. You can seek a protective order or ask that 
your opponent pay some of the cost (which is cost-shifting), as discussed in 
Chapter 12.
In the following sections, we take a look at what you can do to keep your 
costs down during e-discovery — and stay on the judge’s good side at the 
same time.
Applying a reasonableness standard
FRCP 26(g) requires that you certify that you’ve made a reasonable inquiry 
into procuring all the ESI your case requires and that your request and dis­
closure is complete and correct. Judge Grimm in Mancia v. Mayflower warned 
lawyers not to take this certification too lightly. We discuss this certification 
in more detail in Chapter 5.
At a minimum, reasonable inquiry means your outside counsel interviews 
both the custodians of ESI and your IT personnel to understand the type of 
ESI and where it is stored.
If you fail to make a reasonable inquiry, the rule provides for sanctions. You 
face monetary sanctions, an adverse inference ruling (the judge instructs the 
jury to assume facts about your case — often unfavorable to you), or the 
judge can throw out your case.
	
Your failure to engage in effective and efficient discovery can raise your 
e-discovery costs, and therefore you may find going to court not worth the 
expense.

253
 Chapter 15: Viewing e-Discovery Law from the Bench
In Qualcomm v. Broadcom, the court granted significant sanctions against 
Qualcomm’s outside counsel for not making a reasonable inquiry. Judge 
Major noted that “an adequate investigation should include an analysis of 
the sufficiency of the document search and, where electronic documents are 
involved, an analysis of the sufficiency of the search terms and locations.” 
	
For a lawyer, a reasonable inquiry isn’t just a matter of the FRCP. The ABA 
Model Rules of Professional Conduct requires that your lawyer not make frivo­
lous discovery requests. It also requires that lawyers make a reasonably dili­
gent effort in attempting to comply with discovery requests. Failure to make 
a reasonable inquiry could result in sanctions from the court and the Bar 
Association.
While it is difficult to determine if your lawyer is making a reasonable effort, 
communication is the key. Long periods without communication from your 
attorney may indicate that your case is on the back burner. A simple call to 
your attorney can ease your fears. It is important that from the outset there 
are open lines of communication between you and your attorney, and you 
should expect to be kept in the loop at all stages of the case.
Forcing cooperation
Cooperating with your opposing party is key to keeping your e-discovery 
costs down. If discovery is to be used for the proper purpose, it requires 
cooperation of all parties involved. Judges rely on you to work out any dis­
putes without them stepping forward to referee. 
Judges expect you not to harass your opposing party with unnecessary 
delays, unreasonable costs and burdens, or create unnecessary expense. You 
should go to the meet-and-confer session with the expectation that you’ll 
compromise on what ESI you ask for, what ESI you’re going to hand over, 
how you’re going to search for ESI (including specific keywords), and in what 
form you’ll hand it over.
Cooperating doesn’t mean the courts expect you to always agree with the 
other side. Of course, don’t think the other side will always agree with you, 
regardless of how right you are. 
	
Cooperation also doesn’t mean that you give away everything you have. 
You can cooperate and still protect your interests. As noted by The Sedona 
Conference Cooperative Proclamation, advocacy of a position is not the same 
as adversarial conduct. “It is not in anyone’s interest to waste resources on 
unnecessary disputes.” For example, there is no reason not to voluntarily dis­
close information that you know can and will be discovered or to raise spuri­
ous arguments to delay or raise the costs of litigation.

254
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
One thing you never want to do is force a judge to step into your case. You can 
be sanctioned for not cooperating. For example, in Gross Construction Associates, 
Inc. v. American Mfrs., Mutual Ins. Co., the judge chastised both parties because 
they couldn’t agree on search terms and forced the court to draft a list. 
Looking at what’s reasonably accessible
You should attempt to deal with any ESI that is not reasonably accessible 
early in the e-discovery process. Expect to negotiate this standard with your 
opposing party at the meet-and-confer session. And if you can’t come to an 
agreement, put a plan in place to explain to the court why your ESI is not 
reasonably accessible. You may need to hire an outside expert to help you 
convince the judge. This is an added and perhaps unnecessary cost. 
If you’re producing the ESI, you bear the cost. If you have ESI that is not rea­
sonably accessible due to the cost of retrieving it, you can challenge its pro­
duction. The court may either issue a protective order (which says you don’t 
have to produce it) or shift the costs of production to your opponent.
The designation of ESI as not reasonably accessible doesn’t mean it is not dis­
coverable or that you don’t have to produce it. It simply puts your opponent 
and the court on notice that you can get to the ESI but you can’t produce it 
because of the undue burden or cost. The court may force you produce ESI 
despite that designation. 
	
ESI that is not reasonably accessible doesn’t eliminate or reduce your preser­
vation obligation. It’s imperative that you identify any not-reasonably-accessible 
ESI early in the process and assure that the litigation hold includes that ESI. 
Failure to do so could and probably will result in sanctions from the court.
Determining who committed misconduct
When the courts are asked to assess sanctions, or if the court thinks sanc­
tions are appropriate, the court makes a two-fold inquiry:
	
✓	Was there misconduct?
	
✓	Who committed the misconduct?
As discussed in Chapter 5, the court has a wide range of sanctions available 
to deal with misconduct. The misconduct can be by a party, third-party, or 
counsel. All or some may be sanctioned.
	
The court may impose sanctions on its own as well as at the request of a 
party. 

255
 Chapter 15: Viewing e-Discovery Law from the Bench
Forcing a judge to act
A company filed a lawsuit against one of its former employees and his new employer for illegally 
obtaining and using its confidential and proprietary information to hire their staff, open new offices, 
and start a new line of business. The breach of contract case, Koosharem Corp. v. Spec Personnel, 
LLC and Kenneth Fuston, Sr. (2008) was filed in South Carolina in September 2008. The plaintiff 
Koosharem Corporation was doing business as Select Staffing and Resolve Staffing. Select Staffing 
is a human resource (HR) outsourcing company in the transportation industry. Select Staffing had 
purchased Resolve in February 2008.
Defendant Kenneth Fuston, Sr., was a former employee and vice president of Resolve. His employ­
ment contract with Resolve included a non-compete agreement. After resigning from Resolve, 
Fuston became an employee of Spec.
The court granted the plaintiff’s motion and ordered the defendants to produce e-mails to or from 
any current or former employee or customer of the plaintiff found on Fuston’s home computer, 
and documents reflecting communication with the defendant and certain former employees of the 
plaintiff. In response, the defendants produced 1,936 pages of e-mail. The plaintiff didn’t believe 
that the production was complete, and brought a second motion to compel in July 2008.
Several problems or irregularities the plaintiff identified with the defendants’ original production 
included the following:
	✓	All the e-mails produced reflected the date compiled rather than the date received or sent.
	✓	Several e-mails allegedly retrieved from Trevor Doyle did not have Doyle listed as a sender or 
recipient.
	✓	Many e-mails were missing their attachments.
	✓	Documents were modified even after notice of litigation.
	✓	Defendants made no document retention efforts after the lawsuit was filed.
	✓	Defendants’ new hires were not immediately provided with a company e-mail account and thus 
conducted work from home computers and personal e-mail accounts.
	✓	Former employees e-mailed confidential information to their homes before going to work for 
defendants.
The defendants argued against the inspection, which the court denied. The court stated that the 
only issue before it was whether computer forensic analysis should be allowed in light of the 
defendants’ failure to produce documents and because relevant information might be stored on the 
computers. Finding that forensic analysis was appropriate, the court issued this detailed 20-step 
protocol:

	 1.	 Defendants will make available for forensic analysis and data recovery to be conducted by an 
expert forensics firm (“Expert”) any business computers and/or any personal computers used 
to conduct business, correspond in any way regarding business, Spec and/or its current or 
employees, and/or plaintiffs and/or their current or former employees, for Steve Arnold, Walter 
Chudowsky, Benita Dillard, Trevor Doyle, Ken Fuston, Kevin Moore, Steve Roberson, and Jude 
Tallman.
	 2.	 The time frame for the forensic analysis and data recovery will encompass the period 
September 1, 2007, to present.
	 3.	 The parties will jointly agree within five (5) calendar days after entry of this order on an Expert 
that will be used to conduct the data recovery and forensic analysis.
	 4.	 Defendants will produce to the Expert within ten (10) calendar days after entry of this order the 
computers identified in paragraph 1.
	 5.	 The Expert will recover only the documents and e-mail account or accounts used by individuals 
identified in paragraph 1 (or those accounts and documents accessed remotely using another 
computer).
	 6.	 The Expert also will conduct a search or run other appropriate programs to determine whether 
any e-mails or documents have been deleted, destroyed, altered, or otherwise compromised 
since January 25, 2008, and whether any programs have been installed that would alter, 
destroy, erase, modify, or otherwise compromise any portion of each computer or its contents 
as of January 25, 2008. The Expert also will be permitted to conduct such search efforts as are 
necessary to form an opinion as to whether any procedures were put into place to preserve 
e-mails and documents as of January 25, 2008.
	
	 Note: Step 6 looks squarely at whether IT took appropriate affirmative action to preserve ESI.
	 7.	 The recovery of e-mails will include all e-mails in any form whatsoever including, but not limited 
to, deleted e-mails, forwarded e-mails, copied (“cc”) and blind-copied (“bcc”) e-mails and 
draft e-mails. The recovery of documents will include all documents including drafts, multiple 
versions, and final versions.
	 8.	 The Expert will securely maintain the original data recovered in order to establish a chain of 
custody.
	 9.	 The Expert will produce a copy of the recovered data to defendants’ local counsel of record 
attorney John Glancy (“defendants’ counsel”).
	10.	 Defendants’ counsel will review the data to identify any privileged or personal e-mails that it 
seeks to withhold from document production.
	11.	 Within ten (10) business days of obtaining the recovered data from the Expert, defendants’ 
counsel will prepare and provide to counsel for plaintiffs: (I) a log of privileged e-mails 
(“Privileged E-mail Log”) protected against disclosure by a relevant legal privilege and include 
the identity of the e-mail, the sender and recipient (and any individuals identified in the “cc” 
and “bcc” fields), the date sent, the nature of the privilege, a general description of the e-mail 
and the basis for asserting the privilege; and (ii) a log of personal e-mails (“Personal E-mail 
Log”) and include the identity of the e-mail, the sender and recipient (and any individuals

identified in the “cc” and “bcc” fields), the date sent, a general description of the e-mail and 
the basis for claiming it is a personal e-mail. To the extent that defendants’ counsel asserts 
privilege as to any documents obtained from the forensic analysis, such documents also must 
be set forth on a document privilege log (“Privileged Document Log”) and be produced within 
ten (10) business days of obtaining the recovered data.
	12.	 Together with the Privileged E-mail Log, Personal E-mail Log, and Privileged Document Log, 
defendants shall produce (within 10 business days after obtaining the recovered data from 
the Expert) all e-mails and documents recovered by the Expert, which are not identified on 
the Logs.
	
	 Note: Step 12 compels IT to produce non-protected e-mails and documents that are recovered 
by the computer forensics expert. Basically, the outcome of the case falls on IT at this point.
	13.	 For purposes of the procedure described herein, a personal e-mail is one that does not relate 
to or in any way concern: defendants’ employment, whether it deals with past, present, future 
or prospective employment; plaintiffs’ business; plaintiffs’ customers and former customers 
(including contacts at customers and former customers); plaintiffs’ employees and former 
employees; defendants’ drivers or plaintiffs’ former drivers; plaintiffs and any of its employees; 
or Spec Personnel and any of its employees, including but not limited to, communications 
regarding Spec’s closing of offices staffed by plaintiffs’ former employees or efforts to have 
anyone take over, purchase or otherwise assume responsibility for any Spec office staffed by 
plaintiffs’ former employees.
	14.	 If any document attachment to an e-mail is identified through the discovery of an e-mail, and 
such document was opened, saved from, detached or otherwise transferred or reproduced 
on the hard-drive of defendants’ computers, such attachment shall be produced or the Expert 
shall be given access to defendants’ computer to conduct further data recovery in order to 
obtain such document(s).
	15.	 If any document is identified by the Expert as being opened, saved, altered, transferred or 
reproduced and it falls within the scope of the request, such document must be produced by 
the Expert and handled by defendants’ counsel in the same manner as though it was an e-mail 
communication.
	16.	 If plaintiffs disagree with the assertion of any privileges, the parties shall submit to the court 
the disputed documents and Logs for the court to view in camera and determine whether the 
documents must be produced.
	17.	 Defendants are responsible for any and all fees, costs and expenses associated with gathering 
the computers and transmitting them to the Expert.
	18.	 At this time, the parties will share equally the fees, costs and expenses charged by the Expert. 
When the Expert is retained, the Expert will be jointly informed that any billing or retainer must 
be split evenly between the parties. If any retainer is required, the parties are obligated to 
provide the retainer within three (3) business days of the Expert’s request so that the process 
is not delayed in any way. Neither party waives its right to seek reimbursement or payment of 
any fees, costs and expenses charged by the Expert if it is determined that award of such is 
appropriate pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Local Rules or case law.

Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Exploring the Role of the Judge
The judge can play an active or passive role in e-discovery. Judges differ on 
the exact nature of the involvement a judge should have. Some prefer to be 
a bystander unless you ask for their intervention. Others see themselves as 
part of the process from the initial conference. 
	
Judges have little patience if you procrastinate. The courts are always looking 
at fairness and reasonability. If you cause a delay, you had better have a good 
reason — one the court will find reasonable and not unfair to your opponent. 
For example, in Ford Motor Co v. Edgewood Props., there was an eight-month 
delay before the requesting party objected to the form of production. The 
court found the delay to be unreasonable. Judge Salas noted, “it is without 
question unduly burdensome to a party months after production to require 
that party to reconstitute their entire production to appease a late objection.” 
Actively participating
Judges prefer for you to cooperate and agree with your opponent on all 
aspects of e-discovery. The reality is that cooperation is a wonderful goal but 
generally not feasible, and judges have to step in at some point. 
The FRCP anticipates some judicial involvement in the e-discovery process. 
Judges are first involved in e-discovering issues at the initial Rule 16 conference. 
	19.	 By agreeing to this order, no party waives its rights or objections to the discovery sought 
herein.
	20.	 The parties understand and agree that this order addresses the preliminary scope for the com­
puter production and forensic analysis. If the initial production and analysis determines that 
additional searches are necessary, either party may petition the court to revisit the scope of 
this order. This lengthy order was preliminary and the scope of the investigation might expand. 
This court also ordered that the parties share equally the fees, costs, and expenses charged by 
the expert.
Then in September 2008, the plaintiff filed a motion for sanctions [pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)], claim­
ing that the court should infer that the reason the defendants’ didn’t produce all relevant ESI was 
that it was harmful to them in the case. The court denied this extreme motion for sanctions, but also 
said that if the defendants didn’t comply with the order (all 20 steps of it), then the plaintiff could 
resubmit their motion for sanctions. Basically, the defendants were out of options and IT had a lot 
of work to do.
(continued)

259
 Chapter 15: Viewing e-Discovery Law from the Bench
This initial conference is held after the meet-and-confer session and usually 
results in an order that establishes the case management, including initial dis­
covery time frames and any agreements among the parties.
The court also has the inherent power and duty to make sure the case is pro­
ceeding appropriately by doing the following:
	
✓	Overseeing agreements: The scheduling order may include agreements 
of the parties such as clawback agreements or other agreements on the 
discovery issues. A clawback agreement allows discovery to proceed and 
any inadvertently disclosed privileged or protected communication to 
be returned or “clawed back” by the disclosing party.
	
✓	Issuing orders of protection, orders to produce or sanctions: Judges may 
be involved in determining what’s accessible to the form or production to 
developing search terms for the parties. You might seek an order to pro­
duce if you believe your opponent is not disclosing all relevant ESI. You 
may also seek a protective order limiting the ESI you have to produce (if 
you have privileged, protected, or not reasonably accessible ESI). 
Scheduling conferences
Judges are expected to take an active role in pretrial/scheduling conferences 
under Rule 16. Judges generally establish case management orders to force 
you to keep the case actively progressing. 
FRCP Rule 16(c)(2)(C) specifically provides for the court’s role in control­
ling and scheduling discovery. Judges hope that the meet-and-confer session 
results in as many agreements as possible, which allows them to keep the 
case moving forward. Usually the judge incorporates these agreements into 
his or her scheduling order (a document outlining how the case will proceed). 
	
The court has the power under Rule 16 to control discovery but also under its 
inherent power to control the judicial process of a case. 
Appointing experts
Sometimes the IT professionals don’t agree with the lawyers. The lawyers 
want certain e-discovery, but your IT expert says it’s not possible or may 
cost too much money to get it out of the archive. 
So in that case, the court may bring in an expert to help settle your e-discovery 
issues (called a Special Master). FRCP Rule 53 provides for the appointment 
of a Special Master to

260
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
	
✓	Perform duties consented to by you and your opposing party
	
✓	Hold trial proceedings and make or recommend findings of fact on 
issues to be decided without a jury
The powers and duties of the Special Master are set forth in an appoint­
ing order (appoints the person to serve as Master and establishes what the 
Master will do). In general, the Special Master may have the power to 
	
✓	Regulate the process of discovery.
	
✓	Exercise authority to compel or protect evidence. 
	
✓	Provide advice and guidance to the court. 
	
✓	Invoke sanctions. The sanction power doesn’t include Contempt of 
Court, but the Special Master may make that recommendation to the 
court.

In Peskoff v. Faber, the judge found that the ESI sought by the plaintiff from the 
defendant couldn’t be obtained without the aid of a forensic examination; the 
court decided to bring in a computer forensic expert.
The use of Special Masters is growing with the evolution of e-discovery. The 
judge in In re Seroquel Products Liability noted that a familiarity with The 
Sedona Principles is important for e-discovery cases. From the candidates 
agreeable to both parties, the judge selected the person with the most hands-
on experience in e-discovery.
Judge Scheindlin makes the case for the use of Special Masters in e-discovery 
disputes. In a co-authored article at 30 Cardozo Law Review347, the judge 
investigated various uses of Special Masters in aiding the court in the 
complex area of e-discovery. He set out four common uses for Masters in 
e-discovery:
	
✓	Facilitating the process of e-discovery.
	
✓	Monitoring discovery compliance as it relates to ESI.
	
✓	Adjudicating legal disputes related to ESI.
	
✓	Adjudicating technical disputes and assisting with compliance on 
technical matters, such as system inspections. 
	
✓	Adjudicating claims of privilege or protection. In fact, the Federal 
Judicial Center’s Managing Discovery of Electronic Information: A Pocket 
Guide for Judges indicates that this is a good use of a Special Master. See 
Chapter 10 for a discussion of privilege and protection.

261
 Chapter 15: Viewing e-Discovery Law from the Bench
A case of an active judge
The case of Sheila El-Amin, et al., v. George Washington University is an excellent example of 
how a judge may be of assistance to the parties in moving a case forward. The court doesn’t want 
a truckload of boxes filled with hard-copy documents to be brought to the courthouse and used 
in a trial. No judge wants to have to canvas thousands of documents when making decisions on 
motions. In this case, Judge Facciola became an active participant in assisting the parties. The 
judge noted that the primary goal was to “create a system whereby all existing documents are 
hyperlinked to fields in a database that will permit the instantaneous retrieval from within the 
database of information offered by plaintiffs in support of any factual proposition.” The secondary 
goals are identified as coming up with a system that is “capable of being easily used by counsel 
and by the Court.”
The judge noted that the court must be provided with the software. Furthermore, the system must 
be self-contained so that its use isn’t contingent on outside information. In other words, everything 
is there that will be needed to handle production and deal with objections. The court noted: that it 
would like to see a database that allows for the parties to hyperlink proposed evidence. The system 
should allow the opposing party to review and state its objection and hyperlink any evidence it 
would offer in opposition. This would also be available to the Court for its review and ruling of the 
issue. A seamless flow of e-discovery.
The court then established requirements for the selection of a vendor for this system. The judge 
indicated that all existing ESI must be subject to being captured by Optical Character Recognition 
(OCR) for integration, all handwritten information coded for integration, all information provided to 
the vendor will be returned and must be preserved by the party information, and the system must 
provide protection so that information inputted by counsel stating why evidence is or is not suf­
ficient must preclude disclosure of earlier drafts. Judge Facciola seemed to favor a Web-based 
database for ease of meeting the goals. However, the judge acknowledged that there may be valid 
concerns over Web-based security. If a non–Web-based system is used, then the parties and the 
court must have access. 
Judge Facciola took the unusual step of providing the parties with a database example that might 
be appropriate. The following minitable is Judge Facciola’s chart.

Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
For example, if you’ve determined that your ESI is not reasonably accessible, 
the Special Master can determine whether your search results were adequate 
or other technical matters. Because judges, like lawyers, often lack the tech­
nical skill or background, the use of Special Masters can help resolve dis­
covery disputes. This Special Master is not just facilitating or overseeing the 
e-discovery process but actually dealing with the technology. As a result, the 
Special Master should have appropriate technology credentials. 
The use of Special Masters can alleviate significant burdens on the time 
and resources of the court system. They are discretionary and should have 
clearly defined tasks. They can be effective in promoting efficiency and econ­
omy in the legal process. If you have a case, don’t be shy about asking for the 
appointment of a Special Master.
	
A Special Master may be appointed by the court at your request or at the 
request of your opponent. The appointment is totally in the judge’s discretion. 
Or the court can decide on its own to appoint a Master. You then share the 
costs.
Determining the scope of costs
Cost-shifting (asking your opponent to pay for some of your production costs) 
may also be appropriate as a sanction for misconduct. The courts have little 
or no patience for misconduct. Although adverse inference or termination 
sanctions aren’t the norm, the court is generally amenable to shifting the 
cost. Cost-shifting is done under either the FRCP or the court’s-inherent 
power. The costs can be significant as the court seeks fairness in the process.
In determining if cost shifting is appropriate, the court attempts to determine 
the additional costs you’re forced to incur as a result of the misconduct of 
your opponent. This includes not only the costs associated with discovery of 
the ESI but includes your attorney and expert fees. Of course, the judge has 
the ultimate say in the amount and type of sanction, but you must consider 
this when planning for e-discovery.

Chapter 16
e-Discovery for Large-Scale 
and Complex Litigation
In This Chapter
▶	Getting ready for complex litigation
▶	Using ESI to win your case
▶	Informing the judge of your ESI issues
▶	Going to court for e-discovery resolution
▶	Assessing accessibility
▶	Bringing in others
T
he expediential growth of ESI has been a nightmare for some and a boon 
for others. Companies are now faced with the potential of significant 
time, effort, and costs in complying with e-discovery. This is especially true 
in large multi-party and complex litigation and other types of matters, such 
as governmental investigations. Any litigation where the dollar amounts are 
$100,000 or more is considered a large case.
Knowing how to deal with these ESI discovery issues and proper preparation 
can significantly reduce your burdens. It might also mean the difference in 
the outcome of a case. Additionally, it might avoid unnecessary and costly 
sanctions.
In this chapter, you see the special issues applicable to e-discovery in large-
scale and complex cases, the approach of the courts, and dealing with out­
side vendors. Also discussed is the important role that cost-shifting plays in 
these types of cases.
Preparing for Complex Litigation
Quite possibly, the outcome of a case might be determined by one e-mail. 
Finding that one e-mail might be like finding the proverbial “needle in a hay­
stack” because that one e-mail might be among hundreds of thousands of 

264
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
documents relevant to the case. In fact, it might not be found at all. There is 
also the problem of the other side playing “hide and seek” with that very rel­
evant ESI. They hide; you seek and hope you find.

Seven Network Ltd. v. News Ltd. took five years to conclude at an estimated 
cost in excess of $200 million. Discovery resulted in ESI containing 85,653 doc­
uments or 589,392 pages. Of those, 12,849 documents or 115,586 pages were 
admitted into court. The plaintiff lost the suit.
Complex ESI matters might be encountered in any types of case. ESI may be 
present in all types of litigation. The following examples are considered large 
cases either because of the complexity of the issues or the large amounts in 
controversy. Some examples are
	
✓	Anti-trust: The government claims that a company has engaged in 
behavior that reduces competition in the marketplace. For example, 
United States v. Microsoft.
	
✓	Sexual harassment/retaliation: A party claims they were subject to 
harassment or a hostile work environment based on gender or that the 
company retaliated against them for making a claim of sexual harass­
ment. For example, Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC.
	
✓	Securities fraud: This is where a company or persons engaged in behav­
ior that defrauded or mislead investors. This is a civil case. For example, 
Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. v. Morgan.
	
✓	Criminal fraud: Where a party engaged in any type of criminal fraud 
relating to financial transactions. For example, United States v Bernard 
Madoff.
Complex litigation often involves multiple parties and complex legal issues. 
You should start preparation well in advance of litigation or investigation. 
Your company should have an overall document retention and identification 
plan in place that assumes you will be involved in e-discovery. Preparing 
before the lawyers come knocking on the door may save both time and 
money. Preparation is your secret weapon in e-discovery. Your document 
retention plan should include the following:
	
✓	An archive policy that ties into the document retention policy
	
✓	A regular plan to survey the location of potentially privileged or 
protected ESI
	
✓	An indexing system to identify protected and privileged ESI
	
Make sure that employees are aware of the policy and how to implement it. 
Regularly monitor them to assure compliance. Regularly test that the system 
is working effectively and efficiently.

 Chapter 16: e-Discovery for Large-Scale and Complex Litigation
Ensuring quality control
In the e-discovery process, you will soon find that there is no one best way to 
negotiate the e-discovery process. Each case has its own unique issues and 
problems that cannot be solved by a cookie-cutter approach.
Often, large-scale cases involve voluminous ESI located in multiple venues 
with large numbers of people having potential access. This creates major 
challenges for quality control assurance, such as 
	
✓	The more people with access and the more remote the locations of the 
ESI, the more difficult it is to both preserve and produce the relevant ESI. 
	
✓	The volume creates a problem of locating and culling privileged and pro­
tected ESI. This may be further complicated by multiple parties (defen­
dants or plaintiffs) and numerous legal issues. 
Complex litigation is characterized by the legal difficulty of the issues 
involved. A result of more complex issues is a need for more evidence, which 
usually translates into more ESI and more potential for problems associated 
with e-discovery. A well-thought-out project management approach is the 
best way to deal with these challenges.
	
The Sedona Principles, Second Edition: Best Practices, Recommendations & 
Principles for Addressing Electronic Document Production (2007) and The 
Sedona Conference Best Practices Commentary on the Use of Search and 
Information Retrieval Methods in E-Discovery at www.thesedonaconference.
org are good places to start your preparing for litigation.
Quality can be viewed in two ways:
	
✓	The need for quality control over the process: The specific procedures 
and tools you use in the e-discovery process.
	
✓	Quality assurance: The results are complete and accurate. The court 
can impose numerous sanctions for your e-discovery misconduct.
According to The Sedona Conference, quality assurance is also important for 
at least four other reasons:
	
✓	Without a quality process, you can affect the outcome of your case by 
not discovering or uncovering relevant ESI.
	
✓	You may inadvertently disclose privileged or protected ESI and the 
court may refuse to provide you relief. (See Chapter 10.)
	
✓	Taking the time to measure quality assures your results are accurate 
and allows you to correct any mistakes you’ve made.
	
✓	You may have to repeat the entire e-discovery process again if your first 
effort was poorly planned, costing more money than doing it right the 
first time.

Quality control impacted the outcome of Victor Stanley, Inc. v. Creative Pipe. 
Judge Grimm held that the privilege claim on inadvertently produced docu­
ments was waived because of a lack of quality control to show they were truly 
inadvertent. The judge noted that Creative Pipe had a number of failures in 
quality control: failure to prove the keyword search was reasonable, failure to 
provide the qualifications of the person who came up with the search terms, 
failure to explain how what they did was sufficient in the context, and failure 
to show any quality assurance testing.
Getting a project management 
process in place
Having a project management process in place is important from the start of 
e-discovery.
	
This process involves both IT and lawyers. The Sedona Conference Best 
Practices Commentary on Achieving Quality in the E-Discovery Process recog­
nizes that no matter what tools you use, you won’t get a successful outcome 
unless you do the following:
	
✓	Your team understands the circumstances and requirements of your 
case.
	
✓	You use thoughtful and well-defined methods.
	
✓	You measure your results for accuracy.
	
Proper preparation before the meet-and-confer session could be a deciding 
moment in the litigation. Being prepared and understanding the ESI issues is 
essential to an effective meet-and-confer session.
We discuss putting a project management process in place in Chapter 3.
Proving the merits of a case by using ESI
Because more than 90 percent of all business documents are electronically 
generated and the use of electronic communication (such as e-mail, texting, 
or social networking sites) is growing, ESI is essential to almost any case. 
As we discuss in Chapter 12, once authenticated, ESI may be introduced as 
evidence in court. Therefore, it is not only essential to a case to know what 
ESI you have but also what else might be out there.
Because complex and large-scale cases generally have a number of compli­
cated legal issues and voluminous ESI, proving the merits of the case become 

267
 Chapter 16: e-Discovery for Large-Scale and Complex Litigation
more difficult. Locating the relevant ESI from numerous locations and pre­
serving it can be a challenge for any company. Adding to this complexity is 
the discovery and protection of privileged and protected ESI that may on a 
hard drive of an employee’s computer. Determining what relevant ESI the 
other party or a third party has that is needed to prove your case and how 
to get it is only multiplied when the issues become more complex. It can 
become even more burdensome when there are multiple parties as the chal­
lenges grow exponentially.
Educating the Court about Your ESI
The court is responsible for overseeing your conduct — and your opposing 
party’s conduct, as well — during the course of your case. The court rules on 
the admissibility of evidence, may sanction you or grant summary judgment 
on your pleadings, and can even take the case out of the jury’s hands. 
	
The importance of educating the judge about the issues of the case and the 
ESI is so the court can adequately manage the process of the case. If you’re 
in federal court, check out Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth (Manual) at 
www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/mcl4.pdf/$file/mcl4.pdf. 
This manual describes methods that federal judges may employ in complex 
cases and addresses ESI discovery issues directly.
Your initial conference with the court addresses litigation management and 
most likely results in a case management order. The case management order 
establishes benchmarks to keep the case moving forward. If your case some­
how gets off track from the case management order, you need to discuss with 
your opponent new timelines, and then submit a proposed order to the court 
incorporating what you’ve agreed to. The initial conference under FRCP Rule 
16 takes place no later than 120 days after the defendant has been served or 
90 days after the defendant has appeared, whichever is earlier.
	
You must keep the court informed on the progress of your case — either for­
mally (through a written status report) or informally (by phone).
During the initial conference, the judge questions your attorney to focus the 
issues and relevant facts of your case. Topics will include:
	
✓	The nature and potential dimensions of the case
	
✓	The procedural and substantive problems that are likely to be 
encountered
	
✓	Procedures for the efficient management of the case

268
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Using summary judgment and other tools 
A summary judgment is a decision on the outcome of the case made by the 
judge based upon the evidence available to the court at the time. It is a 
matter of law. If you feel that your opponent hasn’t stated a legal cause of 
action or has no legal defense, you can ask the judge for a summary judg­
ment. Judges are reluctant to take cases out of the jury’s hands or to rule 
without a trial on the merits, so it’s unlikely the judge will grant you a sum­
mary judgment. Nevertheless, it’s a good tactic to take because it can force 
your opponent to provide additional, more-focused discovery to address the 
issues raised in your motion. This can help to move the case forward and 
ultimately reduce costs.
If the judge doesn’t grant your summary judgment, and you can’t come to an 
agreement of the facts about your case, you can try the following things:
	
✓	Force your opponent to stipulate to facts: Judges frequently force you 
to stipulate certain facts in an attempt to determine what facts are at 
issue. The courts are encouraged in the Manual to have you participate 
because clients often take the admit-nothing approach. There may be 
strategic disadvantages to denying matters on which the other side 
clearly will prevail at trial or denying something that should not have 
been disputed. That may bring into question your denials of things that 
really do matter if you deny matters where you are clearly wrong.
	
✓	Request for admissions from your opponent: In this request, you list the 
facts that you’re requesting the other party to admit. If he admits the fact, 
then it is no longer an issue before the court. Your opponent will probably 
deny your requested admission on some trivial disagreement with the 
statement to be admitted. However, their response goes in the court docu­
ment. If your opponent fails to answer in good faith, they can be sanctioned 
and you might recover your costs in proving something they denied. 
	
✓	Draft a series of numbered narrative statements of the objective facts: 
These should not be conclusion of law and avoid being argumentative. 
Your opponent must then address each of these facts and indicate those 
that are admitted or will not be contested and those that are contested 
and the basis for the position. He can make additional narrative fact 
statements to be answered by you. The result should be a consolidated 
statement reflecting what you’ve agreed to and what you haven’t.
Employing an identification system
The court often requires you to use a uniform identification system for docu­
ments that you’re producing. With paper discovery, this is Bates stamping 
or Bates numbering (named for the Bates Manufacturing Company that held 
the original patent on the stamping machine). With ESI, the court can order a 
system of identification that complements or integrates a paper-based system.

269
 Chapter 16: e-Discovery for Large-Scale and Complex Litigation
However, databases containing millions of data elements, none of which is 
meaningful alone, can be difficult or impossible to break down and organize 
in a way directly analogous to conventional documents. An identification 
system might make use of hash values to develop a numbering system for 
identification. If you’ve properly prepared for the meet-and-confer session, 
you can come up with an agreeable production system that you can then 
propose to the court. 
	
A production log helps you later if you get into a dispute with your opponent 
about production.
Form of production
In complex litigation, the courts want to avoid trucks backing up to the court­
house to unload boxes of documents. The Manual favors production of ESI 
in electronic form rather than paper. It recognizes many benefits from this, 
including:
	
✓	The ability to search, retrieve, and organize large amounts of data 
quickly
	
✓	The ease of performing computer-sophisticated analysis on the ESI
	
✓	Cost and time savings in storage, duplication, and transmittal of 
information
	
✓	The ability to preserve ESI links and attachments
	
✓	The ease of presentation in the courtroom when using technology
We talk more about production in Chapter 11.
Creating document depositories
When you’re dealing with a lot of ESI, you might want to create a central doc­
ument depository to keep ESI production efficient and economical. Require 
that your team produces all discovery materials in common, computer-
readable formats and insist that these materials be made available on 
computer-readable media (such as CD-ROMs or DVDs) produced at a central 
location, through a secure Web site or a dial-in computer network. Doing so 
reduces the expense and burden of document production and inspections. 
A depository also helps you keep track of what documents you’ve produced 
and the information in them, which can help minimize later disputes with 
your opponent. Part of the process of establishing a central depository is set­
ting up uniform procedures for acquiring, formatting, numbering, indexing, 
maintaining, accessing, and copying the stored ESI.

270
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
The cost of establishing and maintaining a central depository may be sub­
stantial. The court can consider whether the costs are justified by the cost 
savings and other benefits derived from the depository’s use. If you find the 
expense to be too great, you can do the following:
	
✓	Ask the court to allocate some of the costs to your opponent. The judge 
could order your opponent to pay the setup and maintenance costs of 
the depository.
	
✓	Use a pay-as-you-use system. The costs are set at an amount to cover 
the costs of the depository. You only incur costs to the extent that you 
access the central depository. If there are multiple parties, a pay-as-you-
go system may be a great savings to you if you don’t have the same ESI 
issues as others.
	
✓	If you can’t pay any of the costs, ask the judge for special arrange­
ments. If there’s a depository already set up for a case that has similar 
issues as yours, the judge can simply grant you access, which can 
reduce duplicative production costs and the cost of maintaining the cen­
tral depository.
	
If you’re involved in a case that involves multiple lawyers in several locations, 
consider establishing your own depository, whether the courts advise one or 
not. If Internet-based, it can be a virtual 24/7 discovery management system 
that allows attorneys at various locations to access, review, search, make 
notes, and provide comments on the ESI. Responsive ESI can be indexed and 
privileged, and protected ESI can be identified and tagged as privileged or 
protected. But you must be careful to limit access only to what each individual 
needs so you don’t compromise any privilege you might want to claim later.
Many vendors can create (or assist in creating) these depositories (which we 
talk about later in this chapter). Vendors are helpful in litigation because, if 
needed, you have an expert to verify the collection processes and procedures. 
Additionally, many law firms use litigation support and production software for 
storage and retrieval, which serve the same function as depositories.
Avoiding Judicial Resolution
You face sanctions if you don’t meet and confer in good faith. The courts 
expect you to settle most disputes with cooperation. If you don’t come to 
the meet-and-confer session ready to work with your opponent, you can lose 
your case. You can agree to protocols that are costly yet might not protect 
information you want to keep privileged or confidential. Or you can put the 
issue before a judge who may not look favorably upon your case.
It is imperative that you come to the meet-and-confer session with a full 
understanding of what ESI you have, what you want from your opponent, and 
what you don’t want to give to your opponent.

271
 Chapter 16: e-Discovery for Large-Scale and Complex Litigation
	
You won’t always get what you want, but with proper planning, understand­
ing, and negotiation, you can usually get what you need.
When dealing with large-scale litigation, getting everything in order for the 
meet-and-confer session is a huge task. Here are some methods that can 
help you:
	
✓	Discuss an informal production of documents and search protocols. 
Clearly the best way to reduce costs is for you to turn over ESI volun­
tarily. Of course, there are legal considerations and constraints that 
your lawyer will consider before deciding whether to hand it over. 
Another way to save time and costs is agreeing to search protocols for 
relevant ESI and to cull privileged or protected ESI.
	
✓	Consider a rolling discovery schedule. Rolling discovery is like climb­
ing a hill and then coasting down the other side. You start with a small 
initial request to test the search terms and criteria. This can provide 
you with a more realistic view of the scope and costs of ESI before 
proceeding further. It can focus your e-discovery requests and if you 
ask the court for an order of protection to protect against burdensome 
e-discovery. 
	
✓	Agree to clawback and or quick peek agreements. Both of these reduce 
some of the cost and time burden. Clawback agreements allow you to 
exchange ESI freely with your opponent; if you accidentally disclose 
privileged or protected ESI, you can get it back, and your opponent can’t 
use the ESI against you. In a quick peek agreement, you provide a snap­
shot of ESI for the purpose of establishing what you may have and the 
format it is in; you then can determine to a greater extent what you want 
to see in full discovery. If there is any privileged or protected ESI, you 
can’t use it and must return it to your opponent.
	
✓	Agree to statistical sampling. Properly structured search protocols 
with appropriate quality control and assurance allow you to perform 
software-based searches instead of reviewing hundreds of thousands of 
pages by hand.
	
	You can set up your software to allow documents that are tagged as 
responsive or privileged to be put into folders for appropriate review 
while not touching other documents. Privilege and redaction logs can 
be created. This does not eliminate the need for a legal review, but will 
reduce the manpower and man-hours needed.
Determining the Scope of Accessibility
The drafters of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) provided that 
practical limits should be placed on discovery. Any nonprivileged matter that 
is relevant to your claim or defense is subject to discovery; but you may not 
have to submit it to the court if you reasonably calculate it may lead to the 

272
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
discovery of admissible evidence. Under Rule 26 (b)(2)(C), the court may 
place limits on discovery if:
	
✓	The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely 
benefit (considering the needs of your case), the amount in controversy, 
your resources, the importance of the issues at stake, and the impor­
tance of the discovery in resolving the issues.
	
✓	The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or you 
can obtain it from some other source that is more convenient, less bur­
densome, or less expensive.
	
✓	You’ve had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in 
the action.
In ESI related matters, the FRCP limits the requirement to preserve and 
produce if you’ve identified the ESI as not reasonably accessible because of 
undue burden or cost. The court can order discovery subject to certain con­
ditions, one of which is asking your opponent to bear some of the costs.
	
You’re responsible for any costs associated with preserving and producing 
your own ESI. The court can shift, in limited circumstances, all or part of those 
costs to your opponent. 
Not reasonably accessible is not the same as inaccessible. Very little ESI is 
actually inaccessible. With the right technology and financial resources, 
almost all existing ESI is accessible. The focus of the courts is on any undue 
burden or cost. There is no definition in the FRCP of what is not reasonably 
accessible. This has become a much-litigated area. This concept is discussed 
in greater detail in Chapter 6.
Doing a good-cause inquiry
When you’ve shown that the requested ESI is not reasonably accessible, then 
your opponent can attempt to show good cause for the court to order that it 
be produced. The court looks at the following factors when determining good 
cause:
	
✓	The specificity of the discovery request
	
✓	The quantity of information available from other and more readily acces­
sible sources
	
✓	Your failure to produce the relevant information that is likely to exist or 
have existed and is not available on more easily accessible sources
	
✓	The likelihood that relevant ESI will be produced that cannot be 
obtained through other more readily accessible sources
	
✓	The importance of the information sought

273
 Chapter 16: e-Discovery for Large-Scale and Complex Litigation
	
✓	The importance of the issue that the ESI is expected to address to the 
outcome of the case
	
✓	Your resources
	
If your opponent requests ESI that you believe is not reasonably accessible, 
make an offer to produce it if the other party pays all or part of the costs of 
production. If you make a reasonable offer of cost-sharing and the other party 
rejects it, then that might indicate to the court that the other party does not 
find the requested ESI to be that important to the case; certainly, a factor the 
court might consider.
Cost-shifting
The court has the inherent power to oversee and manage the discovery 
process. In looking at the good cause issue, the court can set conditions on 
allowing the discovery of not reasonably accessible ESI. Among those condi­
tions is cost-shifting to reduce or eliminate your undue cost burden. If your 
opponent really wants ESI you believe to be not reasonably accessible, he 
can pay for it.
In Rowe Entertainment, Inc. v. The William Morris Agency, Inc. the court 
applied an eight-factor test for allocating costs. In Zubulake, Judge Scheindlin 
modified the factors and applied a seven-factor test:
	
✓	The extent to which the request is specifically tailored to discover rel­
evant information
	
✓	The availability of such information from other sources
	
✓	The total cost of production, compared to the amount in controversy
	
✓	The total cost of production, compared to the resources available to 
each party
	
✓	The relative ability of each party to control costs and its incentive to 
do so
	
✓	The importance of the issues at stake in the litigation
	
✓	The relative benefits to the party of obtaining the information
	
The Zubulake factors apply at the federal level. Many states pattern their 
approaches to the example set by the federal courts. Some states take an 
absolute approach. That is, if ESI is not reasonably accessible and you want it, 
then you pay to get it.
	
The court is not likely to shift costs after they’ve been incurred. If you are 
seeking cost-shifting, make sure you do it before incurring the costs.

274
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Getting Help
Electronic discovery–related services have become a cottage industry. 
Vendors offer solutions to lawyers and companies alike. Outside vendors 
might serve as document depositories (as discussed earlier) and consultants, 
or provide a wide range of search and other e-discovery solutions. Many law 
firms either do not have a dedicated e-discovery group or do not have the 
resources for a particular project. As the litigation becomes larger and the 
ESI issues more complex, there is a greater need for outside assistance. 
Some firms have both dedicated in-house e-discovery teams and software 
tools. Software solutions are available for searching, processing, document­
ing, and reviewing ESI.
Partnering with vendors 
or service providers
Vendors can provide services that assist in two areas of e-discovery: add 
needed expertise and control costs. Some vendors offer a one-stop-shop 
approach to e-discovery. Others offer specialized legal or IT expertise. They 
might provide valuable assistance in the collection, processing production, 
and storage of ESI. They might add a second set of eyes for consulting or data 
forensics that require independent experts to authenticate and establish a 
chain of custody.
The costs must be weighed against the benefits they can provide. Some 
solutions can be very costly. The expenses are front-loaded in the litigation 
process, but they may end up being a savings. Much of this is a matter of 
what services are needed. For example, it is not unusual for a law firm to hire 
contract lawyers for document review. The downside to outside vendors or 
consultants is a loss of some control and less communication than having it 
done in house.
Selecting experts or consulting companies
	
You bear the ultimate responsibility for the actions of your attorney and other 
vendors and consultants. The courts show little sympathy for a sloppy, late, 
or ill-conceived discovery search protocol simply because an outside vendor 
did it.
All cases are not the same and involve unique issues. An outside vendor must 
be able to tailor the services to the needs of the case. That also requires 
the ability to adjust midstream to changes as the case unfolds. Experience 

275
 Chapter 16: e-Discovery for Large-Scale and Complex Litigation
cannot be understated. State of the art technology can improve vendor per­
formance, but ultimately, a human element comes into play.
It is important that you get to know your vendors or consultants to develop a 
good working relationship. You may want to consider the following process 
to select a vendor:
	
1.	Submit a request for information (RFI).
	
	 An RFI allows you to ask for information about the skill level, staff, expe­
rience, software, and services offered. Ask for references and consider 
interviewing vendors that submit RFIs so you can get a better feel for a 
possible working relationship.
	
2.	Submit a request for proposal (RFP).
	
	 The RFP sets forth the services that you require and asks for a proposal 
for those services. You should include a series of measurements of 
vendor performance. These will include assurances of timely perfor­
mance and quality assurance. You may also want to include assurance 
that the most up-to-date technology will be used in your project.
	
3.	Negotiate a contract.
	
	 After you focus on a vendor, you will negotiate the final terms of the con­
tract. Be sure to include performance metrics.
Many law firms use litigation and production support software. Your attorney 
should have someone who is well versed in the technology assigned to the 
e-discovery aspects of the action. Smaller firms may not have this luxury and 
may rely more on manpower or outside vendors or consultants. You should 
know this up front. This should not be a disqualifying point but you should 
make sure that you know whom the vendor is and what will be done. You 
may wish to be involved in the selection of an outside firm that will be doing 
the e-discovery work. This is more often a problem in a small case where the 
attorneys may not be large firms. In most complex litigation, you will find 
larger firms with full litigation support within the firm.

e-Discovery for Small Cases
In This Chapter
▶	Profiling small cases 
▶	Hunting and gathering e-evidence
▶	Keeping a lid on costs
▶	Looking at e-evidence in small cases
▶	Figuring out whether it’s real or fake
E
lectronic discovery is not always extensive, complex, or wildly expen­
sive. It’s used in many types of legal actions where the dollar amount in 
dispute isn’t great (less than $100,000), there’s not a large quantity of ESI to 
go through, or there’s only one or a few data custodians who also might be 
one of the parties in the lawsuit. Small-matter litigation are common occur­
rences in both state and federal courts. Breach of contract, Internet defama­
tion, divorce, or custody disputes, which fall under state law, and theft of 
intellectual property or trade secrets, personal bankruptcy, employment dis­
crimination, and harassment heard in federal courts are examples. Much of 
small litigation is person-vs-person, in contrast to enterprise-vs-enterprise, liti­
gation. People operate their lives from their digital devices, leaving histories 
that, if properly handled, may be admissible in court.
In this chapter, you find out how e-discovery can be affordable and critical to 
discovering the truth in small cases. These cases don’t require a full arsenal 
of litigation support services or a fully stocked e-discovery team. The price 
tag for cases that are e-discovery light can come in under $2,000. You also 
read about the rule on proportionality, which keeps e-discovery within the 
scale of the value at issue. Establishing and protecting the integrity of the 
e-evidence plays a big role because often opponents know each other and 
have access to each other’s laptops and cellphones. And you also read how 
IT policies that allow personal use of company-owned laptops or cellphone 
devices make those devices subject to forensic search in domestic and other 
personal cases. 

278
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Defining Small Cases that Can 
Benefit from e-Discovery
Harassment or discrimination cases can result from ill-fated relationships 
between an employee and non-employee (or two employees) who text, 
tweet, e-mail, or send compromising photos via your company’s networks or 
devices. Other types of small cases that can implicate your company or its 
computer and cellular resources are labor disputes, wrongful terminations, 
corporate espionage, or trademark or intellectual property disputes. All of 
these cases can land one or more of your company’s hard drives or flash 
drives in court. The hard or flash drive can come from work computers, 
personal laptops, or personal and business cellphones. 
Theft of proprietary data 
and breaches of contract
You work for a small to medium enterprise (SME), and you’re concerned that 
an employee who’s leaving is sending privileged information via the com­
pany’s e-mail system to the new employer. Certainly leaving such obvious 
clues is outright dumb, yet it’s widespread — in part, because some people 
take the path of least effort. The departing employee may mistakenly believe 
that by deleting the sent messages, the evidence is gone. Theft of intellectual 
property or breach of contracts leave obvious trails and details that you can 
use to recover losses due to the theft. 
	
Some terminated employees may steal customer or product data to improve 
their job opportunities with a new employer. In addition to traditional state 
remedies, such as misappropriation of trade secrets, you can take advantage 
of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act’s (CFAA) civil remedies to sue 
former employees and their new companies to get compensated for your 
losses.
Marital matters
E-mail, GPS, and cellphone logs; Web photo albums (such as Google’s Picasa 
Web Albums, at http://picasa.google.com); and postings on social net­
works give divorce lawyers many avenues of proof of misconduct.
If you have evidence that at any relevant e-evidence is stored on your 
spouse’s hard drive, you can file an e-discovery request seeking complete 
access to the hard drive. You may even be granted access to password-
protected files if there’s a reasonable possibility that such files contain rel­
evant evidence.

279
 Chapter 17: e-Discovery for Small Cases
Your company can become a third party to divorce cases. For example, in 
a divorce case brought against an executive vice president (EVP) on the 
grounds of adultery, the plaintiff may seek to discover the defendant’s texts, 
e-mails, and incoming and outgoing phone records from the company-issued 
BlackBerry. The plaintiff may subpoena the EVP’s employer for access to the 
defendant’s desktop and laptop computers. The EVP’s messages may contain 
references to corporate trade secrets and to attorney-client-privileged mat­
ters with corporate counsel that are unrelated to the divorce action. You may 
need to hire forensic computer experts and lawyers to preserve and remove 
all privileged ESI. If you’re in this situation, see Chapter 13, where we talk 
about computer forensics specialists.
When parties are emotionally embroiled, that volcanic situation has the 
power to interfere with the e-discovery process and even make cost con­
cerns secondary or irrelevant to a personal agenda. Nowhere is that more 
true than in bitter divorce cases. As you can find out in the later section, 
“Characterizing Small Matters,” your company computers and handhelds 
may become discoverable in marital cases.
Defamation and Internet defamation
Defamation can lead to a lawsuit. Defamation is a false statement that dam­
ages a person’s reputation and exposes that person to public contempt, 
hatred, ridicule, or condemnation. If the false statement is published in print 
or through broadcast media, such as radio or TV, it’s libel. If the defamation 
is spoken, it’s slander.
You must usually prove these three things for defamation:
	
✓	The statement was published. Someone had to see or hear the statement.
	
✓	The statement is false. The statement that’s made about the person has 
to be more than only an opinion.
	
✓	A person or company’s reputation was damaged in some way.
Defamatory statements made in blogs or text messages (including those on 
Twitter) are leading to lawsuits. The first libel suit against a Twitter user was 
filed in a United States court in March 2009. Singer Courtney Love was sued 
for libel for her allegedly defaming remarks about fashion designer Dawn 
Simorangkir on Twitter and MySpace. This lawsuit is one of a growing class 
of suits against bloggers, posters, tweeters, and social media users. You can’t 
hide if you’ve posted something that is defamatory. 
In 2009, the Media Law Resource Center (www.medialaw.org) tracked 258 
Web-related U.S. lawsuits. That number was a steep increase from 110 cases 
in 2008. The lawsuits included defamation, copyright infringement, and fake 
profiles on social network sites such as MySpace and Facebook. Blog post­
ings made up the majority of Internet-related lawsuits. 

280
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Characterizing Small Matters
Electronic discovery may be the only method that allows you to easily find 
evidence and win your case. Electronic evidence in the form of e-mail mes­
sages of secret relationships or attachments with stolen client lists are pretty 
much irrefutable. 
Keeping ESI out of evidence
One of the most common defense methods in small-matter cases is to file a 
motion arguing that the e-evidence is inadmissible because the device was 
illegally accessed and/or the e-evidence was improperly obtained. It’s tempt­
ing for cost reasons to underestimate the importance of retaining a computer 
forensics expert to create a forensic image the hard drive and to later attest 
to the e-mails’ authenticity. The risks you face for giving in to that temptation 
are not being able to defend yourself in court because the opponent shot 
down your unauthenticated e-mail evidence. Without any chance of a do-
over, your case may be doomed. 
Here are some motions to have ESI excluded from the case, along with the 
conditions under which they’re effective or the reasons why they fail:
	
✓	Wiretap violation: A wiretap is a device attached to a communica­
tion system to listen in on what’s being sent over the wire, so to 
speak. Wireless communication can also be wiretapped to eavesdrop. 
Wiretapping is illegal because it violates our right to privacy. The 
wiretap statute only covers messages that are intercepted while in 
transit. The statute does not cover messages that are stored on a hard 
drive or flash drive after the transmission has ended. Arguments that 
you’ve accessed either sent or received e-mail or text messages illegally 
because of the wiretap statute won’t succeed because those messages 
are at rest, and not in transit.
	
✓	Privacy invasion: Privacy is the right to be left alone. Privacy protection 
requires that reasonable efforts were made to actually protect privacy. 
You can’t expect to have privacy if you’ve not taken or implemented 
security defenses to ensure privacy-protected conditions. Here are a 
couple of scenarios where privacy wasn’t protected:
 
• When a computer is in a kitchen, family room, or other shared 
space where it is (or can be) used by both spouses, a claim of 
invasion of privacy has no foundation, even if the computer is 
employer-owned. 
 
• When access to a computer is not password protected and files are 
not password protected or encrypted, you haven’t got a prayer in 
an expectation of privacy motion. 

281
 Chapter 17: e-Discovery for Small Cases
	
	For example, in a 2004 Connecticut divorce case, the husband wanted to 
search his wife’s laptop to help his case. (In Connecticut, it’s legally rel­
evant if one partner is responsible for the marriage collapse.) Stamford 
Superior Court Judge Kevin Tierney ordered the wife to stop using her 
laptop and turn it over immediately to the court clerk’s office.
Shared characteristics with large cases
Cases of all sizes share common characteristics. You use e-discovery in small 
or personal cases to learn the truth of the matter and to win your case, just 
as you do in complex litigation. Arguments about privilege to keep some 
e-evidence inadmissible are common to both. However, e-discovery in small 
matters has unique characteristics and would not be (or would not need to 
be) managed as a scaled-down version of large or complex e-discovery. Using 
the full strength of complex litigation support could amount to using a bull­
dozer to pick violets.
	
Companies involved in occasional small matters may choose to manage those 
cases as they do large cases if they have litigation support services available, 
or as a matter of policy. Chapter 16 covers how to handle large cases, if that’s 
how you choose to conduct your small case.
No matter what the type of case, several issues are essentially the same. Here 
are nine characteristics that large and small cases tend to have in common:
	
✓	The outcome or resolution may be based on budget constraints instead 
of the merits of the case. 
	
✓	You file motions and counter-motions to include or exclude ESI to be 
resolved by the court or a Special Master. A Special Master is a neutral 
expert appointed by the court to act as a referee for the parties and to 
advise the judge. The Special Master may be a lawyer with technical 
expertise or an IT expert appointed by the court to help resolve 
e-discovery disputes. 
	
✓	Disputes arise over what’s protected and what’s not.
	
✓	Electronic evidence can be hidden or fabricated.
	
✓	ESI of third parties may be subject to e-discovery.
	
✓	Electronic evidence needs to be authenticated in order to be admissible.
	
✓	Cutthroat tactics can be the norm.
	
✓	The proportionality rule applies in that courts will not compel you to 
pay more for e-discovery than the value of the case, unless there’s good 
cause. You read more on this topic in the upcoming “Curbing e-Discovery 
with Proportionality” section.

282
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
	
✓	Federal or state rules of civil procedure and evidence apply. The typical 
small matter is tried in state courts and, therefore, isn’t subject to the 
amended federal rules, but your state may have adopted comparable 
rules. As of mid-2009, 21 states have added e-discovery amendments to 
their civil rules. Check with your lawyer about specific state laws.
Unique characteristics and dynamics
Small cases have several unique characteristics and dynamics that affect the 
handling of ESI or the e-discovery process. Small cases have one or more of 
the following characteristics: 
	
✓	Individual vs. Individual, (20##): A big difference is who’s suing 
whom. Both parties in the case may be individuals, such as in defama­
tion, certain types of contracts, negligence, divorces, or child custody 
cases. Even if a case is a personal matter between individuals who 
may be business partners, co-workers, worker and supervisor, former 
friends, or soon-to-be former spouses, companies may become involved 
if responsive e-mail, photos, or text messages are sent via company-
owned equipment. 
	
✓	Employee vs. Employer (20##): The plaintiff is an employee filing a suit 
against the company or another employee, who could be the supervisor. 
	
✓	Low case value: Value of the case is $100,000 or less, assuming that the 
plaintiff has valued the case realistically. 
	
	This upper-bound is not a hard and fast amount that separates all cases 
into small-case or large-case categories. The value of the case may be 
much lower.
	
	We’ve seen cases where the plaintiff sues for a ridiculously high and 
round number, like a million dollars. That’s not grounded in reality. 
Baseless valuations may be an attempt to intimidate the defendant into 
settling the case. Settlement can consist of a series of pretrial maneu­
vers that may lead to a resolution of the case by a monetary or some 
other nonfinancial agreement. Cases may be settled with an apology, 
granted a big monetary award, or the defendant publicly admitting a 
wrong against the plaintiff. 
	
	Some lawsuits are filed by parties even though they know the case has 
no merit or justification. Courts refer to them as frivolous litigation. 
	
✓	Low cost of e-discovery or computer forensics: Cost of the e-discovery, 
including the forensics work, may be as low as $2,000, but likely under 
$20,000. The circumstances of the case may require only an expert who 
can review and analyze the e-evidence and provide an opinion.

283
 Chapter 17: e-Discovery for Small Cases
	
✓	Few data repositories: Electronic evidence can be found on one or two 
computers or digital devices; or the data may need to be provided by 
an Internet service provider (ISP), for which a subpoena or court order 
would be needed.
	
✓	Instant onset: There may not be a prelitigation or litigation-readiness 
stage. In domestic disputes, future defendants would be concerned with 
trying to eradicate ESI and not preserve it. That is, if the individual even 
thinks about it at all. 
	
	The frequency with which indiscretions are caught because of personal 
collections of reveal-all messages shows that people don’t learn from the 
destroyed careers and messed-up lives of others. 
	
	Putting aside ethical or moral issues, the chances of indiscreet messages 
being exposed are darn high. But then, the over-the-top lavishness of 
Las Vegas exists because people refuse to believe that the laws of prob­
ability apply to them.
	
✓	Emotional decisions: What a case lacks in value it can more than make 
up for in passion and drama. One or both of the parties may make deci­
sions that are driven by a strong emotion (such as payback) or by the 
attitude that “it’s the principle of the thing,” which may not make eco­
nomic sense. 
Even if a company is not one of the litigating parties, company-issued lap­
tops, PDAs, and cellphones may be targeted for evidence. As you read in the 
nearby sidebar, e-discovery may not involve a litigation team or support 
services. 
Proceeding in Small Cases
Procedures to follow in e-discovery for small cases can amount to a single 
step. You hire a computer forensics expert who performs the investigation 
live in court. 
But that approach would be unusual. Lawyers ask judges for court orders 
to seize computers and cellphones and copy the drives, particularly if there 
is an opportunity to glimpse a couple’s full financial picture, or whether a

Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
A computer is a filing cabinet 
without e-discovery immunity
In 2007, a wife (the plaintiff) filed for divorce, 
citing cruel and inhumane treatment and her 
husband’s extramarital relationship with a 
woman he met in an online chat room. The 
plaintiff had found several hundred pages of 
incriminating instant messages (IMs) on a 
laptop that her husband, a retired IT consultant, 
left in the trunk of a car. The sole issue being 
disputed was the ownership of the laptop, and 
not the specifics of the IMs. If the wife had no 
right to access the laptop, the IMs would not 
be admissible evidence, and she could not use 
them to support her position. 
The wife claimed the laptop was used by the 
family. The husband argued that the laptop 
was issued by his employer for his use. The 
defendant’s lawyer filed a motion to suppress 
the contents of the laptop on the grounds that 
the wife had improperly seized his personal, 
work-issued computer. The wife’s lawyer 
contested the motion, citing, among other 
precedents, Byrne v. Byrne (2002) in which 
Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice William Rigler 
compared a home computer to a filing cabinet. 
Justice Rigler wrote
“Clearly, plaintiff could have access to the 
contents of a file cabinet left in the marital resi­
dence. In the same fashion she should have 
access to the contents of the computer.”
New York Supreme Court Justice Saralee 
Evans ruled that the wife’s actions did not con­
stitute computer trespass nor had she used a 
computer without authorization because the 
files were on a readily accessible computer. In 
her ruling, the judge also cited the filing cabinet 
analogy. Justice Evans denied the husband’s 
motion to suppress, stating
“Defendant states that only he was authorized 
to log on and that his password was a ‘strong 
one.’ Plaintiff’s expert [attests] that no files on 
the computer were encrypted and no pass­
words were required.”
The judge ruled that the company-issued laptop 
was subject to e-discovery because, in effect, 
it was a mixed-use laptop — for both business 
and personal use. 
When a computer is shared by the family, or 
couples have revealed their passwords to each 
other, reading a spouse’s e-mail messages 
and introducing them as evidence in a divorce 
case is often allowed. Authenticity may or 
may not become a challenging issue, depend­
ing on whether the person whose e-mail is 
revealed denies sending them or that they were 
accurate.

Here are the key steps for managing e-discovery in small matters:
	
1.	 Find out what access or contact the other party has had with the 
devices, storing potentially relevant ESI, as well as the ESI itself. 
	
	 Prior to the filing of a case, the other party may have close proximity to 
the devices or ESI, or may own them. She’s had the opportunity 
to snoop around e-mail, spreadsheets, financial programs, Internet 

285
 Chapter 17: e-Discovery for Small Cases
histories, and so on. She may have conducted a do-it-yourself type of 
search and already seen or collected the ESI. Suspicious individuals, in 
an effort to find the truth, may have installed keystroke loggers to com­
puters, obtained cellphone logs, or snooped through computers and 
handhelds, opening files and messages. Possibly the other party has 
already seen the e-evidence and knows exactly where it is, or has made 
a copy of the files or messages.
	
	 Opening files puts a big dent in their integrity and compromises their 
use as evidence. Stay away from using any compromised ESI that could 
weaken your case. Do-it-yourself e-discovery tactics — such as hacking 
a computer or installing spyware on it — most likely are illegal or could 
compromise the ESI. Spyware programs may violate federal and state 
wiretap laws, leading to large-scale lawsuits over their use. 
	
2.	Send a preservation letter. 
	
	 The next step is to compose and send a preservation letter notifying 
the other party not to delete responsive ESI or destroy the hardware 
on which it’s stored. The letter informs him to stop using, accessing, 
turning on, powering, copying, deleting, removing, or uninstalling any 
programs, files, or folders; or booting up. You can find examples of pres­
ervation letters in Chapter 7.
	
3.	Retain a computer or mobile forensics expert. 
	
	 In many cases, you’ll need a forensics expert. Your expert might refute 
your opponent’s expert on the interpretation of the ESI. 
	
	 Hiring a computer forensics expert is necessary when you’ve made a 
motion to have the other party turn over a computer or cell device to 
have hard drives copied. If the court grants the motion, she has to turn 
the computer or device over to your computer forensics expert or the 
court clerk immediately. The expert makes a forensics copy of each hard 
drive and places those copies with the court clerk. Most likely, those 
files are not accessed or reviewed until stipulation by both you and your 
opponent or on further order from the court. The holdup on the review 
of the ESI is due to privilege and confidentiality issues. Unlike complex 
litigation, where ESI is reviewed for privilege before producing it, all ESI 
is produced when the hard drive is surrendered. 
	
	 If you have confidential or privileged e-mails or documents on a hard 
drive, prepare a privilege log listing any documents that should be 
exempt from discovery. We talk about privilege logs in Chapter 10.
	
4.	Review and analyze the reports of both forensic experts.
	
	 After the forensics expert has examined the drives for responsive ESI, 
she prepares a report detailing the facts about what was found, inter­
prets those facts, and draws inferences and opinions. The expert’s 
report is given to your opposing party, whose expert reviews the facts, 
interpretations, and inferences — and most likely reports another opin­
ion. Both opinions are then reviewed and used in negotiations to reach a 
settlement or proceed to trial.

286
Part VI: Strategizing for e-Discovery Success 
Curbing e-Discovery with Proportionality
Federal or state rules put a limit on e-discovery costs. Judges decide when 
discovery cost is proportional to measures of value of the case. Decisions are 
based on estimates of these two values:
	
✓	Case value: The lawsuit specifies an amount being sought by the plain­
tiff from the defendant. 
	
✓	Probative value of the evidence: This value is a measure of how worth­
while the evidence is to the elements of the case. The evidence value 
looks at the significance or how likely the evidence affects the outcome 
of the case from the perspective of the judge or jury.
The proportionality rule (it’s FRCP 26(b)(2)) requires that discovery be lim­
ited by the court if 
the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely 
benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the 
parties’ resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, 
and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.
Sleuthing Personal Correspondence 
and Files
Authenticating e-evidence is potentially the thorniest question in 
e-discovery, but it’s one that has received very little attention in the courts. 
Authenticating digital evidence in civil trials has not gotten a lot of judicial 
Forensic accountants follow financial scents
In fraud, dissipation of assets, embezzlement, or 
financial legal matters involving small amounts, 
you need the specialized knowledge of a foren­
sic accountant. The forensic accountant gathers 
evidence from accounting programs for personal 
or small-business use, such as QuickBooks or 
Quicken, and other records from hard drives 
and e-mail. Those records or transactions are 
then carefully traced back to the source of fraud. 
In addition, forensic accountants assist in 
bankruptcy cases. Evidence is gathered to check 
for suspicious financial activity surrounding the 
case. Copywriting and patent infringement, 
insurance fraud, personal injury, and construc­
tion audits are among the kinds of cases when 
a forensic accountant is called in to investigate. 
Hiring both a computer forensic expert and foren­
sic accountant may be necessary if opinions are 
needed on password-protected files or Internet 
activities.

287
 Chapter 17: e-Discovery for Small Cases
attention, in part because most civil cases never go to trial, but also because 
lawyers and judges tend to treat it no different than paper evidence.
The question of the foundation and authentication of electronic records 
is a complicated problem. Anyone with editing software such as Adobe 
Photoshop can create fakes of almost any type of file or photo. Courts have 
to figure out what’s real and what’s not. 
Magistrate Judge Paul Grimm addressed authenticating e-evidence in his 
ruling in Lorraine v. Markel Am. Ins. Co. Both parties tried to enter copies of 
e-mails in support of their motions for summary judgment in a $36,000 insur­
ance claim. Grimm ordered both parties to resubmit their evidence because 
neither had made an attempt to authenticate the messages.
Problems are best avoided by asking for or acquiring the original, electronic 
version of a file, or making a forensic copy of the original. You read about 
forensic copies in Chapter 1.
For the most part, courts have interpreted the rules for authenticating ESI 
as simply as possible. For example, in United States v. Tank (2000), the court 
allowed chat room records entered into evidence when the government 
presented evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to find that the 
chat room log printouts were authenticated. 
In this case, sufficient evidence consisted of testimony of another chat room 
member. In most cases, courts have ruled that as long as the party intro­
ducing e-evidence can produce an expert or witness who can claim that the 
records appear to be authentic, it’s generally entered into evidence.

The Par t of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his seventh part of the book addresses three top 
questions about e-discovery: what are the top rules 
ruling e-discovery (Chapter 18), how do I keep an edge 
on my opponents (Chapter 19), and the #1 self-help chap­
ter, what do judges expect me to know walking into an 
e-discovery case (Chapter 20).
In Chapter 18, you have the top ten e-discovery rules 
explained to you. You’ll find this chapter has exactly what 
you need to know. And we can verify that you can’t find a 
listing of ten rules so perfectly explained anywhere else.
In Chapter 19, we give you a roadmap to e-discovery

gerously armed to win. You’ll want to leverage and advance 
your legal and technical e-discovery knowledge, which we 
help you with. If you see either of us at any of these confer­
ences or vendor events, come over and say hi.
In Chapter 20, we provide lessons from those who suf­
fered terrible fates and the wrath of judges to bring them 
to you. Unless you were born on the sun, you’ll want to 
know about these incredibly hot legal spots to avoid.

Chapter 18
Ten Most Important 
e-Discovery Rules
In This Chapter
▶	Mastering the most critical procedural rules
▶	Sticking to the rules of evidence
I
n this chapter, we briefly present the top-ranked rules of procedure and 
rules of evidence around which to build your e-discovery strategy. These 
rules potentially determine your e-discovery success, so think of them as the 
top ten things you want to know to stay in control. They’re guides to help 
you dodge debilitating blows, such as getting hit with a sanction, adverse 
inference, loss of privilege protection, or the full costs of e-discovery.
You also hope your opponents are clueless about these rules so that when 
they make a mistake, you can turn it into your advantage. Whatever your 
preferred perspective, here’s your handy reference for the biggest rules.
FRCP 26(b)(2)(B) Specific 
Limitations on ESI
Rule 26(b)(2)(B) debuted the concept of not reasonably accessible (NRA) elec­
tronically stored information. The concept of not reasonably accessible paper 
had not existed, or at least it wasn’t recognized in discovery in the past. 
Traditionally, the responding party paid the expenses of complying with dis­
covery requests. But that was before the world shifted from paper to digital 
copy. This rule provides procedures for shifting the cost of accessing NRA to 
the requesting party. 
With this rule, ESI is broken into two classes (or tiers) based on how attain­
able it is. Table 18-1 shows the two tiers.

292
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Table 18-1	
Accessibility of ESI
Reasonably Accessible
Not Reasonably Accessible
E-mail, data, and files on hard 
drives or actively used devices 
and networks
Data or files that need to be retrieved 
using computer forensics methods
Data on flash drives, CDs, DVDs
Un-indexed, hard-to-search backup tapes
ESI on backup tapes in use
ESI stored on obsolete media
ESI routinely accessed through the 
normal course of operations.
ESI that was automatically deleted 
according to a good faith data retention/
disposal policy
You’re being thrown a lifeline, which is avoiding the cost of getting the old or 
legacy storage media and their contents into searchable condition, but you 
have to be prepared to grab onto it. You must know where your ESI is so you 
can convince the judge that it’s NRA. This rule turns on the judge’s decision. 
It’s literally a judgment call. Courts may demand detailed descriptions of the 
precise burdens and costs associated with the collection and production of 
ESI, which in itself can be a big pain to prepare.
You also need to grab this lifeline while it’s there for you because the rule is 
protective and only protective. It’s not a rebate. That means its intent is to 
protect you from undue costs. In the case of Cason-Merenda v. Detroit Medical 
Center (2008), Detroit Medical asked for cost shifting under FRCP 26(b)(2)(B) 
after it had produced the requested ESI. The court refused. FRCP 26(b)(2)(B) is 
intended to provide protective relief before you bear the undue burden or cost.
	
Include the word reasonably instead of taking a shortcut. Use the entire 
term not reasonably accessible because the term inaccessible has a much 
narrower meaning. Your opponent may try to argue that your ESI is not 
inaccessible. Spare yourself having to defend against that argument by not 
opening that door.
Rule 26(b)(2)(C) factors may weigh strongly in favor of e-discovery of not rea­
sonably accessible ESI if the information sought is highly relevant, not dupli­
cative, and cannot be obtained from other sources.
FRCP 26(b)(5)(B) Protecting Trial-
Preparation Materials and Clawback
You have a duty to disclose responsive ESI, but some things are sacred. 
The duty does not apply to protected material, such as your secret recipe 

293
 Chapter 18: Ten Most Important e-Discovery Rules
or formula, trade secrets, intellectual property, or materials prepared in 
preparation for the possible trial. The duty to disclose also does not apply to 
privileged material (between you and an attorney, for example).
However, mistakes happen. Too many (or not enough) people are involved, 
there isn’t enough time to purge the privileged content from the ESI you’re 
producing, or documents are redacted superficially or incompletely. The 
point is, you inadvertently gave away protected materials and you want them 
back. 
FRCP 26(b)(5)(B) gives courts a clear (or at least a clearer) procedure for set­
tling claims if you hand over ESI to the requesting party that you shouldn’t 
have. Typically, when privileged ESI is inadvertently sent to the requesting 
party, you may get the privileged material returned or destroyed if a claw­
back agreement exists between the parties and you move fast. For privileged 
attorney-client and work product–protected ESI, FRE 502 bolsters FRCP 26(b)
(5)(B) by maintaining the privilege or protection for inadvertently disclosed 
ESI. The carpenter’s principle of measure twice, cut once applies here.
	
Specify the scope of your right to clawback inadvertently produced privileged 
information with your opponent and exercise that right as soon as you make 
an inadvertent disclosure. A clawback agreement enables you to get back 
inadvertently disclosed ESI, or have it destroyed, or at least not be used by 
the opposing party. Clawback allows for more liberal and timely e-discovery 
while still protecting your privilege, confidentiality, or work product protec­
tion. But local rules may have different procedures and timelines.
Rule 16(b)(6) permits inclusion of your agreements regarding non-waiver and 
clawback of privilege material in case management and scheduling orders.
FRCP 26(a)(1)(C) Time for Pretrial 
Disclosures; Objections
FRCP 26(a)(1)(C) states that you must make any initial disclosures no later 
than 14 days after the Rule 26(f) meet-and-confer session unless there’s an 
objection or another time is set by stipulation or court order. If you have an 
objection, now is the time to voice it. If you don’t recognize your objection 
soon enough, you may have missed your chance.
In ruling on the objection, the court must determine what ESI disclosures, if 
any, are to be made and must set the time for disclosure.

294
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
FRCP 26(f) Conference of the Parties; 
Planning for Discovery
Rule 26(f) is the meet-and-confer session. This rule forces all parties to 
meet within 99 days of the filing of the lawsuit and at least 21 days before 
a scheduled conference. At this get-together, you’re supposed to play nice 
to discuss the nature of the claims and the ESI to back them up. The intent 
of this rule is to speed up or increase the possibility of a quick settlement. 
Judges expect you to resolve any disputes between yourselves — or at least 
attempt to do so. 
Before you meet and confer, your attorney has a duty to become familiar 
with your ESI. He should meet with IT personnel to identify where and how 
ESI is stored, how accessible it is, and the estimated cost of retrieval. He 
needs to arrive armed with this intelligence to strike a good deal (or at least 
avoid being duped into a bad one).
Your attorney should also have a good idea of the relevant ESI that the other 
side may have in its possession. Further, he should make an initial determi­
nation of any relevant ESI that a third party may possess. You should also 
know who’s going to be your company’s FRCP 30(b)(6) witness, also known 
as a deposition designate. Rule 30(b)(6) requires you to designate one or 
more individuals to prepare for and testify on behalf of your company during 
deposition. You read about witnesses later in “FRCP 30(b)(6) Designation of a 
Witness” section.
In complex civil litigation or those involving huge volumes of ESI, a single 
meet-and-confer session is not enough. You may need to investigate your ESI 
more thoroughly and even come back with consultants to help understand 
technical issues.
FRCP 26(g) Signing Disclosures 
and Discovery Requests, Responses, 
and Objections
A favorite e-discovery enforcement tool of the federal bench is Rule 26(g). 
Judges use Rule 26(g) as a stick to deal with e-discovery abuses. In Mancia v. 
Mayflower Textile Services Co. (2008), Magistrate Judge Grimm explained:

295
 Chapter 18: Ten Most Important e-Discovery Rules
“The rule aspires to eliminate one of the most prevalent of all discovery 
abuses: kneejerk discovery requests served without consideration of cost 
or burden to the responding party as well as ending the equally abusive 
practice of objecting to discovery requests reflexively — but not reflec­
tively — and without a factual basis.”
Rule 26(g) is not subtle. It demands that an attorney sign every e-discovery 
request, response, or objection. The signing attorney is certifying that, to the 
best of his or her knowledge and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry, the 
request, response, or objection is genuine and not an attempt to undermine 
the system.
	
Rule 26(g) imposes mandatory sanctions on lawyers for violations that are not 
substantially justified. The sanction may include an order to pay the reason­
able expenses, including attorney’s fees, caused by the violation. The signa­
ture of the attorney also serves as yours.
FRCP 30(b)(6) Designation 
of a Witness
The responding party has to designate at least one witness who can testify 
on behalf of an enterprise. That witness is cleverly referred to as the 30(b)(6) 
witness, and that person has a duty to be knowledgeable enough to testify.
The 30(b)(6) witness’s role is to explain your company’s operations, such as 
IT infrastructure, data retention policies, or accounting practices, that relate 
to the case as well as how and where responsive ESI is stored and managed. 
Often, the witness needs to testify on the steps taken to find and produce 
requested documents to ensure that efforts were done in good faith. This wit­
ness does not actually testify on the facts of the case.
The role of the witness is most critical if you don’t produce all the requested 
ESI or fail to produce meaningful documents. In those situations, the witness 
needs to present a convincing explanation for what appears to be the lack of 
good faith cooperation.
For large or complex cases, you may need more than one witness. If a wit­
ness cannot answer the questions, you’re in trouble because you’ve failed 
to comply with the rule and may have to either produce another witness or 
face a sanction. Using an unprepared or panic-stricken witness is like failing 
to appear, which may also lead to a sanction, and risks losing the court’s 
confidence, which is never a smart move. Conversely, a 30(b)(6) witness can 
persuade a judge you did everything you could to produce the ESI.

296
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
	
Be careful what you share with your witnesses because witness preparation is 
discoverable. If you show privileged documents to your witness, you may find 
them suddenly unprivileged and have to hand them over to the other party.
FRCP 34(b) Form of Production
To stop arguments about the form of production, FRCP 34(b) establishes pro­
tocols for how documents are produced to requesting parties.
As the requesting party, you get to choose the form of production. Typically, 
you want to request native files because they could have potentially damag­
ing metadata or show the history of track changes.
	
Don’t forget to specify a format for ESI, because you might not otherwise like 
what you get from the responding party. The other party can choose a form 
of ESI production that’s as they ordinarily maintain it. You might not have the 
equipment or expertise to read the ESI easily if it’s not in a form you pick.
As the responding party, you produce the ESI in the form that’s been 
requested. You can object to the requesting party’s form of production and 
state your own format. If the requesting party opposes the suggested format, 
that party has to take action. But if you drag your feet in producing, the court 
may find that the delay wipes out your objection and then you have to hand 
over the ESI in the form the requesting party wants.

Ford Motor Co. v. Edgewood Props. (2009) stemmed from allegations about 
contaminated concrete following the demolition of a Ford plant in New Jersey. 
Edgewood’s initial document request called for ESI production in native 
format, which implies with metadata. Ford responded by informing Edgewood 
that it intended to produce TIFF (tagged image file format) files with accom­
panying searchable text instead of producing in native format. Edgewood 
left this disagreement over format unresolved. As such, Ford proceeded to 
produce its documents as TIFFs in March 2008, August 2008, and November 
2008. Again, Edgewood did not disagree with the production format at these 
times. In January 2009, Edgewood sought to compel reproduction of Ford’s 
documents in native format, as originally requested. The court denied the 
motion. Edgewood lost its chance to control the form of production by its 
non-response, and the court allowed Ford to use the form they wanted. Ford 
counted on Edgewood’s non-response — and it worked.
Rule 34(b) also requires that the documents that you produce to your 
opponent be reasonably usable. Case law has further defined that to mean 
that you should organize, index, and identify your ESI so the documents 
can be read or used by the other party. What that long statement is saying 

297
 Chapter 18: Ten Most Important e-Discovery Rules
is that you can’t data dump: You can’t dump a mess of documents on your 
opponent and expect him to figure out how to extract the data he needs. 
Some parties have tested this principle, and reconfirmed the rule was not 
merely a suggestion. In re Payment Card Interchange Fee & Merchant Discount 
Antitrust Litigation (2007), the judge ruled that producing documents in non-
searchable form violates Rule 34(b). In 3M Company v. Kanbar (2007), the 
judge found that producing 170 boxes of unorganized data did not meet the 
requirements imposed by the rule.
	
Choosing hard copy production waives production in electronic format.
FRCP 37(e) Safe Harbor from 
Sanctions for Loss of ESI
It’s not possible to retain all ESI that’s created or generated. Companies 
reuse backup tapes, which overwrite older data and files. Servers crash. New 
systems are implemented and older ones retired. ESI loss will happen in any 
of those examples. ESI that you cannot produce because you have lost it 
exposes you to spoliation sanctions, which are deliberately harsh to act as a 
deterrent.
Rule 37(e) creates a safe harbor from sanctions if you did not preserve, and 
therefore no longer have, ESI that’s requested provided that certain condi­
tions and circumstances are met.
	
Rule 37(e), of course, doesn’t apply if you deliberately destroyed the ESI. Your 
chance of a safe harbor is zero. 
A key to falling within the safety of Rule 37(e) is having a written electronic 
records management policy and routine procedures, and following them 
consistently.
Once your duty to preserve kicks in, you need to take affirmative action to 
stop routine procedures that could destroy the responsive ESI. Forgetting 
to stop the destruction or waiting a while before stopping is negligence. 
Negligence, ironically, destroys your safe harbor.
Rule 37(e) is like the rule of last resort. You’re required to meet and confer to 
limit scope of discovery and discuss the forms of production, among other 
things, before judges are required to get involved. Failing to work through 
those rules in good faith may result in sanctions under Rule 37(e).

Federal Rules of Evidence 502(b) 
Inadvertent Disclosure
We switch now from rules of procedure to Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 
502(b) Inadvertent Disclosure may give you protection when attorney-client 
privileged– or work product–protected material is inadvertently disclosed. 
By now, you know that nothing comes easy. There are always strings 
attached. Here are three of the strings needed to be covered by the rule:
	
✓	The disclosure had to be inadvertent.
	
✓	You (as the holder of the privilege or protection) took reasonable 
steps to prevent disclosure.
	
✓	You noticed and responded promptly to your error and took reason­
able steps to fix the error.
Federal Rule of Evidence 901 
Requirement of Authentication or 
Identification
In e-discovery, so much attention is grabbed by what is and is not reasonably 
accessible, meeting schedules and deadlines, and motions to compel or resist 
being compelled, that one serious issue is largely ignored: ESI being used as 
evidence. Evidence has to be admissible. One requirement of admissibility is 
that the evidence is what it claims to be; that is, it must be authenticated.
Magistrate Judge Paul Grimm discussed admissibility of ESI as evidence in 
Lorraine v. Markel (2007), stating
“Considering the significant costs associated with discovery of ESI, it 
makes little sense to go to all the bother and expense to get electronic 
information only to have it excluded from evidence or rejected from 
consideration during summary judgment because the proponent cannot 
lay a sufficient foundation to get it admitted. The process is complicated 
by the fact that ESI comes in multiple evidentiary ‘flavors,’ including 
e-mail, Web site ESI, Internet postings, digital photographs, and computer-
generated documents and data files.”

299
 Chapter 18: Ten Most Important e-Discovery Rules
Under Federal Rule of Evidence 901, the authentication requirement needed 
for admissibility is met rather simply. ESI may be authenticated by testimony 
that a matter is what it is claimed to be. Whether the ESI evidence is authen­
tic is a fact question for the jury to decide. Metadata may be used to authen­
ticate an ESI.

E
lectronic-discovery is an exciting, evolving, and at times exasperating 
practice field. Every new IT gadget and communication method adds to 
the volume of ESI, necessitates updates in retention policies, and causes a bear

zation founded in 1997 that exists to provide a place for judges, lawyers, aca­
demics, and other legal experts in e-discovery, complex litigation, intellectual 
property, and antitrust law to collaborate on cutting-edge issues. It is highly 
influential in creating the standards of e-discovery.
E-discovery pioneer and attorney Kenneth Withers (www.kenwithers.
com) is the director of judicial education at The Sedona Conference. Ken was 
greatly involved in the federal rules amendment process.
In 2008, The Sedona Conference launched a multi-year, multi-pronged effort 
to promote greater cooperation in e-discovery and to restore sanity to pre­
trial practice. A document called the Cooperation Proclamation outlines its 
call for action and lists federal and state judges who have signed on to its 
principles. 
The Sedona Conference has various components and special committees:
	
✓	The Working Group Series (WGS) launched in 2002. Each working group 
is a mini think tank that works through challenging issues facing the 
legal system. The WGS receives financial support from private sponsors. 
You see the list of working groups, their charges, and links to the pub­
lications at www.thesedonaconference.org/wgs. Publications are 
copyrighted, but free and downloadable from the site.
	
✓	The Sedona Conference Institute (TSCI) is the continuing legal education 
extension of The Sedona Conference WGS that offers programs once or 
twice per year. You see their list of topics at www.thesedona
conference.org/tsci_html.
	
✓	The Voices from the Desert WGS Audio Update Series gets the word out 
about the efforts of the working groups. Each series is recorded onto a 
CD and can be ordered from www.thesedonaconference.org/wgsa_

Ten e-Discovery Cases with 
Really Good Lessons 
In This Chapter
▶	Learning from the experience of others
▶	Tracking opinions of the e-discovery judges
▶	Finding the but (exception) in every rule
▶	Steering clear of hot spots
I
f you’re irresistibly drawn to learning from legal blunders and unwise 
e-discovery tactics, you’re in luck. Most legal cases have a winner and 
loser, but the outcome (verdict or decision) doesn’t necessarily reflect who 
took the biggest financial hit. Although it’s impossible to estimate how much 
money is spent because of ignorance of e-discovery case law, stupidity, or 
poor planning, our safe guess is a lot. The discovery rules have actually 
increased the costs of litigation. In this chapter, we compile cases whose les­
sons can help prepare you to win or spare you from an expensive experience.
	
These ten cases illustrate a lesson in e-discovery. Although other cases might 
be more glamorous, paying attention to the cases in this chapter can help you 
efficiently, effectively, and competently deal with ESI discovery. 
Zubulake v. UBS Warburg, 2003–2005; 
Employment Discrimination
The opinions of Judge Shira A. Scheindlin in Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC 
(Zubulake I, II, III, IV, and V) have become iconic e-discovery rulings, so we 
have to include them at the very beginning of this chapter. The series of five 
decisions, spanning 2003 to 2005, made this employment discrimination law­
suit arguably the most referenced and definitive case on e-discovery. The test 
established by the court in Zubulake I is the leading standard for determining 
cost-shifting.

310
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Top lessons from the Zubulake decisions are
	
✓	You don’t need to preserve ESI on backup tapes that are not reason­
ably accessible and beyond the normal retention times established by 
your company policy. Two possible exceptions are
 
• If you can identify backup tapes where specific employee ESI is 
stored, then you must preserve those tapes, whether the tapes are 
reasonably accessible or not.
 
• If backup tapes are actively being used for information retrieval, 
then the tapes would likely be subject to a litigation hold.
	
✓	Your lawyer has a duty to affirmatively monitor your compliance 
with ESI preservation and production. Simply notifying you and your 
employees about a litigation hold is not sufficient. Lawyers need to 
review your documentation of preservation efforts and send reminders 
to employees of their obligations during the hold.
	
✓	If you ask that your opponent pay for production costs (cost-shifting), 
your request should be reasonable. Analysis of the work and costs 
involved should be grounded in fact, for example based on the results 
of ESI data sampling rather than guesswork. You should be able to back 
up your request with specifics of what you need, with a specific dollar 
amount.
	
✓	At the end of the day, the duty rests with the party. In other words, 
you’re the one held responsible for anything that goes wrong.
	
You should be familiar with Zubulake decisions and be prepared to craft argu­
ments and responses accordingly. If you don’t, you risk the wrath of the judge.
Qualcomm v. Broadcom, 
2008; Patent Dispute
Fiery disputes about the failure to produce relevant e-mails were non-stop 
in Qualcomm v. Broadcom. The judge found that Qualcomm’s lawyers mis­
represented (legalese for “lied about”) the existence of certain electronic 
documents pertaining to video compression technology. The court pointed 
to Qualcomm’s lawyers adamantly maintaining that no Qualcomm employee 
had sent e-mail to the Joint Video Team (JVT) standards-setting organiza­
tion (SSO). On one of the last days of the trial, one of Qualcomm’s own wit­
nesses testified that she had e-mails that Qualcomm had claimed did not 
exist. Like the Titanic, Qualcomm’s case started sinking. The trial ended, but 
Broadcom’s lawyers were able to force the production of those e-mails four 
months later plus another 200,000 relevant e-mails and documents. In addi­
tion to losing its case, the very angry court invalidated Qualcomm’s video-
related patents and ordered them to pay Broadcom’s attorney fees, court 

311
 Chapter 20: Ten e-Discovery Cases with Really Good Lessons
fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation costs — roughly $8.6 million. 
The court then ordered Qualcomm’s lawyers to give convincing arguments as 
to why additional sanctions shouldn’t be imposed. Then the judge in a never-
seen-before-move sanctioned Qualcomm’s six outside lawyers and recom­
mended that the California State Bar take disciplinary actions against them. 
Three warnings made clear by this case are
	
✓	Electronic discovery misconduct is extremely expensive and stupid.
	
✓	Electronic discovery can change the outcome of a case.
	
✓	Electronic discovery misconduct by attorneys might subject them to 
discipline affecting their license to practice.
Top lessons from the Qualcomm v. Broadcom case are
	
✓	Prepare your expert witness and make sure your expert can answer 
questions.
	
✓	Know what your expert witness knows. Hearing it for the first time in 
court is dangerous.
	
✓	Design, validate, and make sure you understand the data map to mini­
mize the risk of failing to identify and search storage media containing 
responsive ESI.
	
✓	Don’t lie.
	
✓	Consult external and objective IT experts for their opinions and help in 
explaining technical issues. 
Victor Stanley, Inc. v. Creative Pipe, 
Inc., 2008; Copyright Infringement
A defendant’s poorly executed ESI and document review handed the oppo­
nent a win in Victor Stanley, Inc. v. Creative Pipe, Inc. Creative Pipe initially 
had requested a clawback agreement because it had inadvertently handed 
over privileged documents that it wanted back. Later, to get more time to 
review documents, Creative Pipe traded off that clawback request. Then, 
without the clawback protection, Creative Pipe mistakenly turned over 
165 documents to its opponent. The documents included communications 
between the company and its lawyers, which typically are protected by 
privilege. 

312
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Adding to their unfortunate handling of ESI review, Creative Pipe did not 
identify the keywords used to search, used an “expert” to select the key­
words and perform the search whose qualifications were never revealed, and 
failed to demonstrate quality-assurance testing. When Victor Stanley chal­
lenged the search and production, Creative Pipe did not have a reasonable 
explanation of what they’d done and why it was sufficient.
U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Paul Grimm ruled that defendant Creative Pipe 
had no attorney-client privilege in those documents.
Lessons from Grimm’s opinions are
	
✓	Be able to show your work.
	
✓	Use a reasonable, transparent, and defensible ESI review methodology.
	
✓	Find and fix your inadvertent disclosures promptly.
	
✓	Your counsel should cooperate in attempting to reach non-waiver 
agreements.
Doe v. Norwalk Community College, 
2007; the Safe Harbor of FRCP 
Rule 37(e)
We included Doe v. Norwalk Community College for a couple of reasons: the 
use of an adverse inference sanction for spoliation and the application of the 
FRCP Rule 37(e) safe harbor. A safe harbor is a potential safety net against 
sanctions if you lose or inadvertently destroy ESI provided that you acted in 
good faith.
Doe claimed that the hard drives of key witnesses were scrubbed of data 
based upon the conclusion of a forensic computer expert. In determining 
if an adverse inference instruction could be given to the jury, the court 
looked at:
	
✓	Did Norwalk have a duty to preserve? The court found that Norwalk had 
a duty to preserve the ESI (because of rules set forth from Zubulake). 
The college tried to assert that the destruction was the result of the 
normal operation of the system. 
	
	The court took exception to this assertion on two grounds: a duty to 
intervene in the normal operation once the litigation hold took effect 
and the college did not have one consistent routine system in place and 
did not follow the policies in place. As a result, the safe harbor does not 
apply. 

313
 Chapter 20: Ten e-Discovery Cases with Really Good Lessons
	
✓	Was Norwalk behind the spoliation? After the court found a duty to pre­
serve the evidence and that the safe harbor did not apply, it turned its 
attention to the adverse inference ruling. The court found that failure 
to properly implement a litigation hold to be at least grossly negligent 
if not reckless. The judge also found evidence that Norwalk selectively 
destroyed the evidence. This shows intent.
	
✓	Was the destroyed evidence relevant? Lastly, the court addressed the 
issue of relevance. The court held that the fact that, at a minimum, there 
was gross negligence present was enough for an adverse inference. An 
adverse inference is an instruction by a judge to a jury that they can 
assume the worse about a situation. The court also indicated that if it 
were mere negligence, then Doe would have to show the destroyed evi­
dence would have been favorable to her case.
Lessons pertaining to Safe Harbor Rule 37(e) and adverse inferences:
	
✓	You can’t complain about an adverse inference ruling against you if you 
hadn’t implemented a litigation hold.
	
✓	You must be sure to halt any destruction of evidence as soon as there’s 
a litigation hold.
	
✓	You must follow your policy on routine document retention consistently.
	
✓	You must avoid any grossly negligent action.
	
✓	You’re only protected when your e-evidence is lost as a result of the 
routine, good faith operation of your IT system.
	
You should always develop and maintain a workable document retention 
policy that is regularly reviewed and revised as needed. This can avoid prob­
lems later and be very helpful in litigation.
United States v. O’Keefe, 2008; Criminal 
Case Involving e-Discovery
U.S. v. O’Keefe (2008) is an influential case because it addresses ESI in crimi­
nal matters. There is no rule in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 
(FRCrimP) related to presenting documents or ESI to the defendant in an 
organized fashion. No rule says the government cannot just dump documents 
on the defendant.
In O’Keefe, Magistrate Judge Facciola referred to the e-discovery civil rules 
as guidance and authority in this criminal case. The Judge noted that the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) was already in place and could be 
used as a guideline. The Judge recognized that the FRCP is not perfect but 
has been amended to take into account electronic documents. For example, 

314
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
FRCP Rule 34 requires that you produce ESI in the same way you keep them 
or you must organize and label them according to the way the requesting 
party asks for the ESI. Accordingly, the government could not hand over a 
box of documents without file folders or labels, because those files are not 
ordinarily maintained in that manner.
Lessons for criminal law cases involving ESI for which no rules of criminal 
procedure exist are
	
✓	When e-discovery is too technical and complex for attorneys to assess 
adequately, experts might be necessary to determine whether an 
e-discovery search is adequate.
	
✓	Where Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure don’t provide guidance 
on the handling of large quantities of ESI in a criminal case, the 
FRCP should be looked to for guidance.
	
The FRCrimP are slowly developing in this area as ESI becomes more preva­
lent in criminal prosecutions. The FRCP and best practices are important 
guides down this path.
Lorraine v. Markel American Insurance 
Co., 2007; Insurance Dispute
Lorraine v. Markel American Insurance Co. was a lawsuit over insurance cov­
erage for a boat damaged by lightning. The insurance company paid a claim 
for damage, but later Lorraine found additional damage and claimed an addi­
tional $36,000 to fix the boat. The matter went to arbitration, and the arbiter 
gave Lorraine an award of $14,000. Lorraine filed this action claiming the arbi­
ter did not have authority to reduce the amount, but could only determine if 
the damage occurred as a result of the lightning. Both parties filed motions 
for summary judgment (to end the case in their favor) and attached copies of 
e-mails.
In this case, Judge Grimm goes to great lengths to discuss the differences 
between the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Federal Rules of Evidence. 
The case is a primer on how proffered ESI can also be admissible into evi­
dence at the trial. It doesn’t do any good to have it if you can’t use it.
Lessons learned from Lorraine v. Markel American Insurance Co. are
	
✓	Because both sides in this case failed to offer e-evidence to support their 
motions, Judge Grimm denied a motion for summary judgment.

315
 Chapter 20: Ten e-Discovery Cases with Really Good Lessons
	
✓	ESI that is discoverable might not be admissible.
	
✓	Authentication is key to admissibility.
	
✓	There is very little case law on admissibility of ESI but best practices 
applied to e-discovery can be applied to admissibility in court.
	
✓	A comprehensive document retention policy can help ensure admissibil­
ity under the self-authentication rules of FRE 901 or as an exception to 
the hearsay rule under Rule 803(6).
	
You can help yourself by implementing a comprehensive document retention 
policy. For e-discovery issues the importance can’t be understated. You could 
establish arguments under the safe harbor rule and admissibility rules. Just 
because it is discoverable does not mean it will be admitted in court.
Mancia v. Mayflower Textile Services 
Co., et al., 2008; the Duty of Cooperate 
and FRCP Rule 26(g)
Mancia v. Mayflower Textile Services Co., was a collective action against sev­
eral Mayflower companies for violating the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). 
The plaintiffs’ claim was that they had not been paid for overtime work, and 
illegal deductions were being made from their wages. Despite warnings, the 
parties didn’t cooperate or communicate as they were obligated to do.
In Mancia v. Mayflower Textile Services Co., Magistrate Judge Paul W. Grimm’s 
30-page opinion created case law mandating greater cooperation and commu­
nication between opposing lawyers during discovery. The judge was annoyed 
with the requesting lawyer’s use of the words “any and all” and the respond­
ing lawyer’s equally foot-dragging objections that included the words “over­
broad” or “burdensome.” In his opinion, Grimm focused on FRCP Rule 26(g), 
which he considered the most violated discovery rule.
Rule 26(g) is an interesting rule in that it requires the parties and their law­
yers to comply with the purposes of Rules 26 through 37. How? By requir­
ing lawyers to certify (by signature) that each and every discovery request, 
response to a request, and objection to a request is legitimate — not meant 
to drive up costs or cause delays. The certification is critical to ensure that 
parties cooperate in good faith during e-discovery to control costs and avoid 
delays. To motivate cooperation, the rule also encourages judges to impose 
sanctions for any attempts to abuse discovery. 

316
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Top lessons to be learned from Judge Grimm in this case are
	
✓	If you or your attorney violates the certification rules, you’ll be 
sanctioned.
	
✓	Attorneys have an affirmative duty to behave responsibly during 
discovery.
	
✓	You should consider the needs of your case, the importance of the 
issue, and the amount in controversy in discovery.
	
✓	Discovery should be conducted so that the costs are proportional to 
what is a stake in the case.
	
✓	Your attorney needs to cooperate in the discovery process.
	
The cautions are both legal under the FRCP and ethical under the professional 
rules of conduct.
Mikron Industries Inc. v. Hurd Windows 
& Doors Inc., 2008; Duty to Confer
In Mikron Industries Inc. v. Hurd Windows & Doors Inc., a breach of con­
tract case, the defendant sought both a protective order and cost-shifting. 
However, Hurd didn’t show that it had met its obligation under Rule 26(c), 
which requires that you confer in good faith with your opponent. The judge 
ruled against the defendants because if you want a protective order or cost-
shifting, you must in good faith meet and confer with your opponent. The 
judge found that the defendants didn’t comply with Rule 26(c) because they 
didn’t respond to plaintiff’s counsel when it:
“identified specific ‘gaps’ in production and reasonably asked defendants 
to articulate the foundation for their assertion that unsearched ESI would 
produce “little additional responsive information.”
The judge added:
“A conversation with opposing counsel does not become a “meet-and-
confer” conference simply because a party has attached that label to the 
discussion.”
You should always get a protective order before responding to an e-discovery 
request in case you make a mistake and inadvertently (unintentionally) pro­
duce privileged information. A protective order, as the name implies, helps 
protect your claim of privilege if you make that mistake because it’s possible 

317
 Chapter 20: Ten e-Discovery Cases with Really Good Lessons
to waive privilege of documents if you produce them. When you attempt to 
get the opponent to pay for e-discovery costs, that’s known as cost-shifting. 
The court denied the motion for a protective order and cost-shifting.
Lessons to be learned from this case are
	
✓	Failure to meet and confer in good faith and work with the opposing 
party can increase your costs and even destroy your case. Even though 
shifting the burden of cost from one party to another is an accepted 
practice, Judge Robert S. Lasnik denied a motion to do so because the 
requesting party failed to meet and confer in good faith.
	
✓	Complying with the good-faith rule entails a substantive discussion 
with your opposing party. Specifically, your difficulty in producing 
responsive ESI, the extent to which you’ve searched ESI to date, and the 
foundation for your belief that a more thorough search of ESI, including 
backup tapes, would yield only information that has already been 
produced.
	
✓	You need to demonstrate why the requested ESI is not reasonably 
accessible. You provide sufficient detail to allow the requesting party to 
evaluate the costs and benefits of searching the requested sources.
	
Some courts are more willing to sanction parties for failing to participate in 
e-discovery in good faith. Always be prepared to actively and effectively par­
ticipate in the discovery process.
Gross Construction Associates, Inc., 
v. American Mfrs. Mutual Ins. Co., 
2009; Keyword Searches
Gross Construction Associates, Inc., v. American Mfrs. Mutual Ins. Co., (2009) 
was a multi-million dollar dispute over alleged defects and delays in the 
construction of the Bronx Criminal Court Complex. The construction man­
agement company, a non-party to the litigation, sought to produce relevant 
ESI (as required), but without producing its entire e-mail database. Both of 
the parties had suggested such overly common construction terms as “side­
walk”, “driveway”, and “budget”, which were unreasonable search terms. The 
non-party had an obligation to suggest reasonable search terms based upon 
its knowledge of employee classifications and abbreviations.

318
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Magistrate Judge Peck warned lawyers of their responsibility to use 
e-discovery practices that are reasonably designed to retrieve responsive 
ESI. Not performing basic e-discovery tasks, such as interviewing key 
custodians about their communication practices, is inexcusable.
Lessons from this case are
	
✓	Select keywords and search terms with input from the custodians of 
that ESI to learn the words and abbreviations they use. You need to con­
sult them to be able to reasonably identify and retrieve responsive ESI. 
Without substantive knowledge, you’re unable to engage in a meaningful 
Rule 26 meet-and-confer process.
	
✓	Test the proposed methodology to verify its accuracy in retrieving 
responsive ESI and eliminating false positives.
	
✓	Don’t force the court to draft keyword searches.
	
✓	Be sure to cooperate with your opponent.
	
✓	Hire an expert if you need one.
	
Seminal decisions discussing the critical importance of transparency and 
agreement on search methodology, including: Victor Stanley, Inc. v. Creative 
Pipe, Inc., United States v. O’Keefe, and Equity Analytics, LLC v. Lundin, provide

Gutman v. Klein, 2008; Termination 
Sanction and Spoliation
Gutman v. Klein serves as a warning to everyone involved in e-discovery of 
the seriousness of misconduct. It’s also one of the funniest cases to read 
because of the fumbling testimony of the defendant’s “computer guy” (who 
was a relative of the defendant hired to give testimony about the electronic 
evidence) and the glaringly obvious signs of attempts to destroy electronic 
evidence from a laptop. The unprepared relative’s reply when asked what he 
was told to do with the laptop said. 
“I don’t remember the exact wording. Whatever. I told him whatever. I did 
whatever I felt right to do, whatever.”

 Chapter 20: Ten e-Discovery Cases with Really Good Lessons
The court didn’t find the witness’ comments comical. When the defendant 
finally turned over the laptop as they were required to do, the case was hot 
to the touch, and one of the screws from the hard drive casing was missing — 
red flags of tampering with the contents.
Klein was put on notice about a litigation hold. Klein failed to notify employ­
ees of that hold. The failure to notify employees didn’t change his obligation 
to preserve evidence. The forensic examiner found among other things back­
dating of files, tampering with the computer, backdating of the system clock, 
backdating of the operating system installation, use of a scrubbing program, 
unrecoverable file deletion, thousands of files with the same create date, and 
a so-called “stolen” laptop.
The court indicated that this was such an intolerable case of misconduct that 
an adverse inference to the jury was not sufficient to compensate for the prej­
udice (harm) to the plaintiff. The court granted a default judgment in favor of 
the plaintiff, basically deciding the outcome based on the misconduct of the 
defendant. 
	
This case goes another step. The sanction recommendations of Magistrate 
Judge Levy were adopted by Judge Cogan, and ordered that the court clerk 
send a copy of the order and the magistrate’s recommendations to the United 
States Attorney for possible criminal action.
The many lessons to be learned in this case are
	
✓	The court can terminate your case in favor of the other side for 
misconduct.
	
✓	Sanctions are cumulative.
	
✓	Electronic discovery misconduct in a civil case could lead to a possible 
criminal case.
	
✓	The computer maintains information that can detect misconduct.
	
✓	You had better have a good explanation for your actions.
	
✓	Think twice before using a relative as a witness.
	
Although this case is one of extremes, it goes to prove that you can’t 
always outsmart the forensic experts. Misconduct can have wide-reaching 
implications.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Glossary
30(b)(6) witness: An employee who’s designated to testify on behalf of your 
company. The 30(b)(6) witness testifies about the company’s computer and 
e-mail systems, storage locations, electronic records management policies, 
and both the formal and informal (actual) practices. You witness does not 
testify about the facts of the case. Your witness must prepare for the tes­
timony by learning enough about computer operations to respond to the 
questions and categories identified in the notice. Also called Rule 30(b)(6) 
witness.
accessible: Data that’s stored in a ready-to-use format. Although the time it 
takes to actually access the data ranges from milliseconds to days, the big 
issue is that the data doesn’t need to be restored or worked on in order to be 
usable.
acquisition: The process of creating a forensic copy of a hard drive or device 
using specialized tools or software.
active data: Online data that’s accessible, such as word processing docu­
ments, spreadsheets, databases, e-mails, and electronic calendars. Generally, 
active data is simple to access through the computer’s file manager program. 
See also accessible and replicant data.
active file: A file that’s accessible via the operating system.
admissible evidence: Relevant evidence that’s presented at trial and allowed 
by the judge.
adverse inference: An instruction to a jury by a judge that they can assume 
the worst about a situation. For example, when a judge instructs a jury to 
assume an adverse inference about the loss of ESI, the judge is telling the jury 
they can assume that the party got rid of the ESI deliberately because they 
had something to hide.
affirmative act: Being proactive or deliberately taking action. 
ambient data: See residual data.
analysis: The phase in e-discovery when the content of ESI is evaluated, 
including key patterns, topics, people, and discussion.
archival data: See replicant data.

322
e-Discovery For Dummies 
archive: Organized long-term ESI storage. Archives differ from backup copies 
in that backups can be unsearchable data dumps.
archiving: Retaining e-mail, data, or records in an organized way and with an 
index (typically using a specialized archiving system) so that you can manage 
the archive centrally. Archiving is not the same as preserving because 
archiving is done as a routing operation while preserving is done for legal 
purposes.
authenticate: To provide sufficient proof that something is what it claims 
to be.
authentication: Ensures that the forensic image and the original computer 
media are identical.
back up the truck requests: Slang for requests for huge volumes of data. 
The phrase is a carryover from paper discovery days. Expect these types of 
requests to be denied.
backup data: Data that’s not actively in use by a company and that’s copied 
and stored separately on portable (removable) media. The purpose of 
backup is to free up space and for disaster recovery in the event of a system 
failure. Backups are usually stored offsite.
backup tape recycling: Reusing backup tapes by overwriting them with new 
backup data, usually on a fixed schedule, such as every month or every three 
months. Because backup tapes contain large amounts of data, restoring this 
data to review the material relevant to a case is expensive and can take a 
long time.
Best Evidence rule: A rule stating that you need to submit the original evi­
dence, and not a copy of the original evidence.
bit-stream image: An exact bit-by-bit duplicate of a hard drive using non-
invasive procedures. Also called a forensic copy. All active, inactive, deleted, 
and residual data and files are captured in the image. This read-only evidence 
file is also called a forensics or sector-by-sector image. It’s not the same as a 
mirror copy or mirror image, which contains only the active files. See also 
mirror image.
Brook’s Law: States “adding manpower to a late software project makes it 
later.” See also mythical man month. 
burdensome: When doing something is too much work or too disruptive or 
expensive given the circumstances. Also referred to as undue burden.
cache: A type of memory that temporarily stores frequently used information.

323
 Glossary
case law: Body of law or precedents created by judges’ written opinions and 
decisions.
chain of custody: The care, control, and accountability of evidence at every 
step of an investigation to verify the integrity of the evidence. The chain 
shows how the e-evidence was gathered, tracked, and protected on its way to 
court. If you don’t have a chain of custody, you don’t have evidence.
civil case: A case that begins when a person, company, or the government 
(the plaintiff) claims that another person (the defendant) has failed to carry 
out a legal duty owed to the plaintiff. Civil cases are brought in state or fed­
eral courts. See also criminal case.
clawback: An agreement that enables a party who has inadvertently dis­
closed ESI to get it back, or have it destroyed, or at least not be used by the 
opposing party. Clawback gives the responding party some slack (in terms 
of time and precision) when producing ESI while still protecting the ability to 
claim privilege, confidentiality, or work product protection.
cloud computing: Computing services that are rented via the Internet (the 
cloud) from a vendor’s servers without owning the IT infrastructure that sup­
ports them. The cloud model is also called utility computing because, like 
electricity and gas, you pay for the service on a per-volume basis. 
collection: A phase in e-discovery during which ESI is collected in a secure 
manner.
computer forensics: The use of specialized techniques by trained experts to 
find and recover electronic evidence; and then preserve, authenticate, and 
analyze it.
concept searching: A search method that uses the meaning of words to find 
responsive documents. This search technique doesn’t just match words, but 
uses something similar to a thesaurus to find synonyms.
criminal case: A case that’s brought by the government, on behalf of the 
people of the United States, against a person accused of a crime. The United 
States Attorney’s Office prosecutes the case if the person is charged with a 
federal crime. A state’s Attorney’s Office prosecutes state crimes.
critical path: In project management, the critical path is the longest path 
made up of activities that must be completed on time or the project’s dead­
line is not met.
dashboard: Like a dashboard of a car, a (computer) dashboard provides the 
litigation team with real-time information to track the status, timelines, and 
completion of e-discovery activities. 

324
e-Discovery For Dummies 
data custodian: Person who knows how ESI is kept, where it’s kept, and 
whether it’s accessible. Also called a record custodian.
data map: Diagram or list defining the ways that ESI moves through a com­
pany from its creation through storage or disposal. The map can be used to 
explain to outside counsel where data is stored and who has access to it.
Daubert test: In order for an expert’s testimony about scientific evidence to 
be admissible, the expert must meet certain criteria. The criteria form what’s 
called the Daubert test.
dedupe (deduplication): Process of comparing electronic documents or ESI 
and removing the duplicates.
defamation: A statement that injures someone’s reputation and exposes that 
person to public contempt, hatred, ridicule, or condemnation. If the false 
statement is published in print or through broadcast media, such as radio or 
TV, it’s libel. If it’s only spoken, it’s slander.
defendant: The person or party who’s accused. The defendant is listed on 
the right side of the v., as in Plaintiff v. Defendant.
delete: To hide a file or its filename. Deleted files are recoverable because a 
computer system never truly deletes (gets rid of) files.
deposition (also known as a depo): Testimony given by a witness under oath 
that’s recorded by a court reporter. Depositions are made before the trial 
begins, but not in court. A deposition can be the most painful and mentally 
exhausting activity you perform during the case.
discoverable: Subject to discovery.
discovery: The pretrial process during which each party has the right to 
learn about, or discover, as much as possible about the opponent’s case. 
drilldown: Finding the details of summary data. For example, summary data 
are linked to the data that they summarize. When summary data is clicked, 
you see the details. 
duty to preserve: Your company’s pre-discovery obligation to preserve 
potential sources of discoverable ESI. 
e-discovery: Part of the legal system that allows parties involved in a lawsuit 
to request ESI from their opponent in preparation for trial.
e-discovery extortion: The process of threatening a party with expensive 
e-discovery to force that party to settle a lawsuit or case.

325
 Glossary
e-discovery request: An official request for access to or the production of ESI 
that may be used as evidence. Also called production request.
Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM): Organization that develops 
guidelines and standards for e-discovery consumers and providers. The 
model provides a framework for e-discovery that’s widely accepted.
electronic evidence (e-evidence): Evidence in digital or electronic form, such 
as e-mail, computer files, instant messages, PDA calendars, and BlackBerry 
phone lists.
electronic records management (ERM): The plan and procedures for retain­
ing, disposing, and destroying documents and data. Also called records and 
information management (RIM).
electronically stored information (ESI): Digital content; a term introduced 
and used in the 2006 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
ESI lifecycle: The period from when ESI, such as a record or document, is 
created until it is destroyed.
evidence law: A long list of rules about evidence that have exclusions, which 
in turn have exceptions. Rules state which evidence is admissible. See also 
exception; exclusion.
exception: A rule that contradicts exclusions and makes evidence admis­
sible. See also exclusion; evidence law.
exclusion: A rule that makes evidence inadmissible. See also exception.
external counsel: Lawyers who specialize in litigation or trial lawyers who 
are retained by a company as needed. They have the most extensive knowl­
edge of the rules of procedure, rules of evidence, and recent case law. Also 
called outside counsel.
false negative: When filtering ESI to identify what’s relevant, a false negative 
is a file that’s incorrectly (falsely) marked as non-relevant, when in fact it is 
relevant. The result is not including ESI that you should, or under-inclusive­
ness. False negatives are marked as discards. False negatives increase the risk 
of being accused or sanctioned for not producing all responsive ESI. See also 
false positive. 
false positive: When filtering ESI to identify what’s relevant, a false positive is 
a file that is incorrectly (falsely) marked as relevant, when in fact it isn’t rel­
evant. False positives result in including too much ESI, or over-inclusiveness. 
These errors increase the amount of ESI to be reviewed, thereby increasing 
the time and cost of review. See also false negative.

326

FAT (File Allocation Table): A system of keeping track of where files are 
stored on a hard drive, which is formatted as a FAT volume or file system.
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP): The rules that federal courts use 
to determine proper procedure for civil cases, including what material is sub­
ject to discovery or e-discovery.
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCrimP): Rules that control the con­
duct of all criminal proceedings brought in federal courts to protect a defen­
dant’s rights.
Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE): The rules that federal courts use to deter­
mine what evidence is relevant in civil or criminal cases. Includes 67 indi­
vidual rules divided into 11 articles. Articles IX and X address authentication 
and identification of evidence and specific rules regarding writings, record­
ings, and photos.
forensic accounting: Investigating accounting practices to find evidence of 
fraud, embezzlement, and other financial crimes.
forensic copy: A technical term for the copy of a hard drive that’s created

stream image.
forensic tool: A program that applies computer science operations to estab­
lish facts in accordance with strict legal evidentiary standards.
form of production: The form in which responsive ESI is handed over to the 
requesting party. Typically, native form is the form of production.
Fourth Amendment: This amendment to the United States Constitution 
generally protects against unreasonable search and seizures without a war­
rant. However, the United States also has warrantless searches for national 
security purposes, which can defeat the protection provided by the Fourth 
Amendment.
fragmented data: Active data that’s been broken into fragments and stored in 
various locations on a single hard drive or disk.
general counsel (GC): The company’s legal advisors who begin identifying 
the ESI with the help of IT. Other terms for GC are in-house counsel or corpo­
rate counsel.
good faith: Acting ethically and making informed decisions that are not moti­
vated by self-interest.
hash: A computer-based mathematical process of calculating a unique ID to 
authenticate e-evidence.

327
 Glossary
hash value: A digital fingerprint that uniquely identifies the image just as a 
human fingerprint uniquely identifies an individual. The hash value is used to 
verify and authenticate a file or forensic copy.
headerless encrypted files: Files that are encrypted and invisible because 
they don’t have a header for the operating system to detect. Files don’t get 
tougher than this to find and open.
hot docs: Slang for documents, e-mail, text messages, or the like that contain 
relevant content that may affect the outcome of the case. Also referred to as 
smoking gun documents or e-mails.
identification: The phase in e-discovery during which you learn the location 
of all ESI that you may have a duty to preserve and disclose.
image: A short term for bitstream image or forensic image. The evidence file 
created by using forensic software that contains all files from the hard drive 
or other storage media.
inactive data: Data no longer routinely accessed, but retained because of 
regulatory or reporting requirements. 
inadvertent disclosure: Producing (and therefore disclosing) ESI that should 
not have been produced. See also clawback.
intentional disclosure: ESI that’s produced and that’s not protected by 
privilege.
interrogatories: Questions asked prior to trial to find facts about the 
opposing party’s case. The party receiving the interrogatory must answer 
the questions. 
keyword search: Search for specific ESI that contains one or more keywords. 
legacy: Old or outdated; that is, legacy data or legacy systems are based on 
older technology and may no longer be in use. 
litigation hold: A red alert and a notice to preserve ESI that may be 
requested as part of e-discovery. You need to take affirmative action to pre­
vent the destruction of physical or digital documents relevant to a lawsuit 
or government investigation. The purpose of the litigation hold is to stop 
routine (or any other) destruction of potentially responsive ESI and to make 
sure it stays safe until the hold is released. Failed litigation holds have gotten 
some of the biggest headlines in e-discovery because a failed litigation hold is 
the most likely path to a spoliation sanction.
meet and confer (meet-and-confer conference): Within 99 days of a lawsuit 
being filed, litigants have a duty to participate in a meet-and-confer confer­
ence to negotiate an e-discovery plan.

328
e-Discovery For Dummies 
metadata: Data describing a file or its properties, such as creation date, 
author, or last access date. 
mirror image: Generally, it’s a copy of only the active files on a hard drive 
of a computer, and doesn’t include deleted or residual data. See bitstream 
image.
mythical man month: A principle predicting that when you add another 
member to a team, you may increase the time to complete the project delay­
ing its completion. New members take up the time of current members who 
need to stop what they’re doing to train the newbies. See also Brook’s Law.
native format: A file in the format in which was created, such as .doc or 
.docx for Microsoft Word, and that preserves its metadata.
near-line: Near-line data is stored on removable media, like a DVD or flash 
drive, that’s relatively quick and easy to access. A contraction of near-online.
near-line storage: Refers primarily to removable media that store files ran­
domly, such as DVDs or flash drives.
non-party: Neither of the litigants (plaintiff or defendant) in a lawsuit, but a 
party somehow involved because of an ESI connection. Non-parties have the 
same obligations when served with a subpoena to produce ESI. Also referred 
to as a third party.
not reasonably accessible: ESI that’s not easily or readily usable. Backup 
tapes must be restored, fragmented data must be de-fragmented, and erased 
data must be reconstructed, all before the data is usable.
offline: Not readily available. With offline storage, files typically are stored on 
magnetic tape, which requires restoring the tape to read it.
offline storage and archives: Data storage outside the network, such as on 
backup tapes. This category is either magnetic tape or optical disks and is 
referred to as JBOD — just a bunch of disks.
online: Connected and accessible.

prelitigation readiness: Preparing for e-discovery, for example by implement­
ing an electronic records management (ERM) program to ensure ESI is being 
preserved according to litigation and regulatory requirements.
preservation: The phrase in e-discovery following identification during which 
ESI is protected from destruction and alteration. Preserving ESI is archiving 
that’s motivated by a strong sense of urgency. There’s a duty to preserve ESI, 
but no duty to archive. See archiving.
preservation order: A court order that clearly states what to preserve. 
Complying with a preservation order is mandatory or you risk being sanc­
tioned by the court.
privilege: Communications protected from being used as evidence.
probative value: A standard used to judge whether evidence is useful to the 
issues of the case. 
processing: The phase in e-discovery that reduces the volume of ESI and con­
verts it, as necessary, to forms more suitable for review and analysis.
production: The phase in e-discovery when ESI is delivered to others.
proportionality: A standard used to balance the value of the case with the 
cost of producing different kinds of ESI. Proportionality is based on the sub­
ject matter of the dispute, the rules, and the judges.
protection (or protected): Refers to the status of ESI. If ESI is protected, such 
as by privilege or privacy, it doesn’t have to be disclosed.
PST: A personal folder file in Microsoft Outlook.
quick peek: An agreement that allows the requesting party to look at the ESI 
subject to certain agreements. The parties agree that providing the ESI for 
this quick peek is not a waiver of privilege or protection.
RAM (random access memory): A computer’s short-term memory (storage). 
Provides memory space for the computer to work with data. Data stored in 
RAM is lost (ceases to exist) when the computer is turned off.
random access: An access method in which a stored file can be accessed 
directly (as opposed to sequentially) regardless of its physical location on 
the storage medium. Also cleverly called direct access.

stored, and destroyed.
redact: To remove or obscure text from a document so that the obscured 
parts remain confidential and protected. 
replicant data: Data or documents stored on a hard drive when a computer 
automatically backs up while you work on a file. These backed-up files are 
created and saved to recover data that may be lost because of a malfunction

safe harbor: A safety net against sanctions if you lose or inadvertently 
destroy ESI in certain cases. The safe harbor only applies to ESI that’s 
destroyed by routine, good-faith operations of an information system.
sampling: Statistically testing or searching stored ESI to estimate the likeli­
hood of finding relevant ESI. Sampling is basically a test or an audit.
sanction: Punishment imposed by the court for violating a rule, failing to 
comply with a court order, or attempting to deceive the court.
scheduling (and planning) conference: A hearing attended by the prosecut­
ing attorneys, defendants, defendant’s attorneys, and the judge to schedule 
certain dates and deadlines for the case. This meeting is generally the first 
time the litigants and their attorneys come before the court. It takes place 
after the court has received the parties’ meet-and-confer report.
Sedona Conference: An influential e-discovery research and educational 
organization that presents conferences and mini-think tanks (Working 
Groups) that provide e-discovery guidelines that courts and litigants refer to.

obstruction of justice crime.
subpoena: A legal document telling the receiver of it to appear in court or 
face a penalty for not showing up.
