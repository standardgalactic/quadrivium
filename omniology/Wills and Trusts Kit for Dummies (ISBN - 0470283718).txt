Introduction
C
ongratulations. Simply by opening this book you have put yourself 
a step ahead of most people. Yes, it’s tough to think about what will 
happen to your family after you die, but confronting these issues is part of 
taking care of your family.
My goal in writing this book is to give you the information and resources you 
need to create an estate plan. This book includes do-it-yourself tools to help 
you draft your own estate planning documents.
But don’t go thinking that this book will help you only if you want to create 
your own will and trust. It’s much broader in focus. I want you to be comfort-
able with estate planning documents, but also to recognize when you’ll 
benefit from professional estate planning services.
I am of the strong opinion that everybody needs an estate plan, and especially 
a will. With this book, anybody can create a simple will, even if it serves just as 
a stopgap before hiring a professional.
About This Book
Wills and Trusts Kit For Dummies is written in language that is easy to under-
stand. It covers the basic issues in planning your estate, but also delves into 
the details and complications you can encounter in choosing your estate plan 
and creating a will or trust.
You probably won’t read this book and conclude, “This is easy,” but you’ll 
probably conclude, “I can do this.” If not, or if you realize that you simply 
don’t want to plan your own estate, that’s fine, too. You’ll be an educated 
consumer when you hire a professional to draft your estate plan.
Everybody needs an estate plan, so I’ll immodestly claim that anybody who 
doesn’t have an estate plan will benefit from reading this book. You’ll also 
benefit if your estate plan is out-of-date, and you’re not sure whether or how 
to update your plan.

Wills & Trusts Kit For Dummies 
A Special Note for Residents 
of Louisiana
If you’ve been shopping around for books on drafting your own will, you’ve 
probably found that most of them say, “This book is valid for all states except 
Louisiana.” You see this warning for two reasons:
 
 Louisiana’s laws governing the execution of a will are more complicated 
than those of other states, and a mistake can invalidate your will.
 
 More importantly, Louisiana’s unique forced heirship laws will trump 
inconsistent bequests in your will, and you’re severely limited in your 
ability to deviate from the state’s mandatory bequests.
Even if you create an otherwise valid will, without a good understanding of 
forced heirship laws, a court may end up largely disregarding your will or 
allocating your estate in a way that bears little resemblance to what you 
directed.
It’s beyond the scope of this book to give you the state-specific understand-
ing you need to be sure that a Louisiana court will uphold your will. I thus 
reluctantly urge residents of Louisiana to have their wills drafted by a legal 
professional.
Conventions Used in This Book
Whenever you see a word in italics, I’m either introducing a new term or 
using it for emphasis. Likewise, all Web addresses appear in monofont type.
What You’re Not to Read
Throughout the book, I include sidebars that contain information and anec-
dotes that expand on the topics discussed in the chapters. You’ll easily spot 
the sidebars by their gray background color. The sidebars can be amusing and 
informative, but there’s nothing in them that you have to read to understand 
the material in this book. If you’re pressed for time, skip over the sidebars. If 
you find the time to read them later, they’ll still be there.

 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, I had to make a few assumptions about you, the 
reader. If you meet any of these qualifications, you can find what you need in 
this book:
 
 You don’t know much about estate planning and want to get a compre-
hensive understanding of what is involved.
 
 You have a small to average estate and want to create your own estate 
plan composed of a will and possibly a living trust.
 
 You have a large estate and want to do the basics of your estate plan 
yourself while getting professional assistance with specialized trusts 
and tax planning.
 
 You have absolutely no desire to plan your own estate, but want to 
know how the estate planning and probate processes work and want to 
know what you’re doing when you hire an estate planning professional 
to create your estate plan.
I also assumed that you have a computer and can use it to print the work-
sheets from the accompanying CD to create your own estate planning docu-
ments. (You don’t have a computer? Then I’m assuming you have a friend 
who can print the forms for you.)
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into six parts that guide you through the estate plan-
ning process and specific estate planning documents. I include some stories 
and anecdotes to help you understand the concepts I discuss.
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will 
or Trust
This part explains why you need to plan your estate, the dangers of failing 
to do so, and the many benefits you get from completing your estate plan. I 
also cover some of the most important aspects of estate planning, and some 
of the biggest mistakes people make. You find out when you should get help 
from an estate planning professional, what professionals can do for you, and 
how to work with them.

Wills & Trusts Kit For Dummies 
Part II: Everything You Need 
to Know about Wills
This part helps you understand the central role of your will in your estate 
plan and the importance of keeping your will up-to-date. You also find out 
what you need to know about probate court.
In addition, you discover common landmines that can disrupt your estate 
plan and what you can do to avoid will contests.
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work
If you’re considering using a trust for your estate plan, it’s important to know 
exactly what trusts are and what they can do for you. You’ve heard of a 
revocable living trust, but what about other types of trust. How can trusts 
help you avoid estate taxes? This part has all the answers.
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent 
of Your Will and Trust
After you figure out the basics of your estate plan, you still have a bit more 
work to do. You need to take a look at how your retirement and life insurance 
plans figure into your estate and the special issues that can arise from your 
real estate holdings. You also need a plan for your personal and financial care 
in case of illness or disability. This part addresses those topics and more.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part contains lists to help you with common estate planning issues and 
traps. I describe mistakes people often make when planning their wills and 
highlight situations where you may benefit from having a trust. I also tell you 
how to avoid traps that may increase your estate taxes.
Part VI: The Appendixes
This part contains supplemental information to help you complete your 
estate plan. Appendix A describes state law signing requirements for wills. 

5
 Introduction
Appendix B summarizes state estate and inheritance taxes. Appendix C is 
a form that you can use to help gather information for your estate plan. 
Appendix D lists the forms provided on the accompanying CD.
About the CD
The CD accompanying this book includes forms and worksheets for creating 
your estate planning documents. You can print them and mark them up by 
hand or fill them in on your computer and use them to produce your final 
documents. See Appendix D for a lot more information about the CD and the 
forms it contains.
Icons Used In This Book
In the margins of the pages of this book, you’ll find little pictures, called 
icons. These icons call your attention to important points about estate plan-
ning and help you avoid mistakes:
 
When you see the Tip icon, you find hints and suggestions to help you with 
your estate plan.
 
The Warning icon flags a potential trap or pitfall that you may encounter and 
helps you avoid costly mistakes.
 
The Remember icon highlights important actions to take and elements of your 
estate plan that you truly should not forget.
 
The Louisiana icon flags unusual aspects of that state’s laws, which make it 
very difficult to draft your own will.
 
This icon lets you know that you can find a form on the accompanying CD cor-
responding to the estate planning document or process described in the pas-
sage you’re reading.

Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to start at the beginning of this book and read straight 
through if you don’t want to. This book is designed so that you can look at 
a topic you’re interested in and flip straight to that discussion. However, if 
you’re new to estate planning, consider reading through this book to get an 
overview of what’s involved.
 
 If you’re about to do something dangerous and need an estate plan “yes-
terday,” you need a will so start with Chapter 7.
 
 If you’re concerned about how much of your estate will get eaten up by 
taxes, the news (good and bad) is in Chapter 6.
 
 If you have young children and want to be sure that they’re taken care 
of, proceed to Chapter 5 for some quick guidance.
 
 If you have a will or trust already, Chapters 9 and 13 cover how to 
update your estate plan and amend or replace wills and trusts.

Part I
Getting Started 
with Your Will 
or Trust

In this part . . .
T
his part explains why you need to plan your estate 
and the dangers of failing to do so. You find out the 
process of planning your estate, the tools you can use, 
and when you need to get help from a professional estate 
planner. You also discover the process of gathering 
information about your heirs and assets and planning 
your bequests. You discover how to plan for special 
family and personal circumstances, including the care of 
your children, and avoiding taxes.

Chapter 1
Ensuring That Your Last Wishes 
Are Honored
In This Chapter
 Understanding the estate planning process
 Creating your estate plan
 Getting help when you need it
 Making your wishes known
 Avoiding common estate planning pitfalls
You’ve worked hard all your life, have accumulated some assets, and 
have bought a copy of this book. You’re ready to plan your estate.
My best guess? You’re not excited about planning your estate. You have 
already figured out that you have a lot of work to do. You must also think 
about unpleasant things, including your death, the possibility of your inca-
pacity, and how your family will cope without you.
What’s the primary purpose of an estate plan? Taking care of your loved ones 
after you’re gone. Why plan your estate now? Because the sooner you start, 
the more certain you can be that your plan will take care of your family’s 
needs in the way that you want.
As you proceed with this process, you’ll probably find out your estate plan-
ning needs aren’t as complicated as you thought. You may discover that all 
you need is a will, perhaps backed up by a simple living trust. You may dis-
cover that your needs are more complicated and enlist the help of an estate 
planning professional. Yet even then, your understanding of the estate plan-
ning process and tools will help you communicate your needs and choose 
your best options.
Having an estate plan also provides a great deal of comfort. You’ll be able 
to plan for your family’s financial needs. And after your death or incapacity, 
your loved ones won’t have to fret about what you would have wanted them 
to do. They’ll know your actual wishes.

10
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 
What Can Happen When You 
Don’t Plan Your Estate
Simply put, if you don’t plan your estate, the government has an estate plan 
in store for you. Your state’s laws of intestate succession will apply, and the 
state will decide who inherits your assets, usually your spouse and children. 
But that’s not all:
 
 In the event of your incapacity, a court may appoint people to make 
decisions for you regarding your personal and medical care and the 
management of your money. A stranger may end up deciding where you 
live, what medical treatment you receive, and perhaps even whether you 
really need $20 for a haircut.
 
 If you have minor children, a court will have to decide who will care for 
them, but will not have the benefit of your input.
 
 The business you spent a lifetime building may end up failing or in the 
hands of a court-appointed receiver.
Planning your estate isn’t a one-time task. Changes in your life circumstances 
can dramatically alter both your wishes for your estate, and whether your 
original estate plan even remains viable.
Sometimes it seems like your life doesn’t change much, so you may be won-
dering what sort of changes I am talking about. Consider the following:
 
 Your estate will probably grow substantially over the course of your life, 
although it may also shrink.
 
 You may marry, divorce, separate, have or adopt a child, or experience 
a death in your family.
 
 Your children will grow up and establish their own households.
 
 You may move between states, buy and sell property, or start your own 
business.
 
 Your designated trustee or personal representative may no longer be 
available, or your relationship with that person may change.
 
 Laws may change. In fact, they will. You can expect a new estate tax bill 
to be working its way through Congress within the next year or two, and 
it won’t be the last.
In all probability, you’ll update your estate plan several times during your 
life, and on occasion you may even start over from scratch.

11
 Chapter 1: Ensuring That Your Last Wishes Are Honored
 
If you don’t update your estate, over time your estate plan may become 
largely ineffective. When that happens, you’re not much better off than you 
were before you created the outdated estate plan.
Reaping the Benefits of Planning 
Your Estate
The biggest advantage of planning your estate is that your wishes will be 
respected, both while you’re alive and after your death.
Your estate plan helps you in several ways:
 
 Incapacity planning helps ensure that you receive the type of medical 
care and treatment you want, that your assets are managed according to 
your own wishes, and that your end-of-life decisions are respected.
 
 Your will and trust ensure that your assets are distributed to the heirs 
you choose, under terms and conditions you define.
 
 Your business succession plan helps ensure that your business doesn’t 
fail following your incapacity or death, and that control of your business 
passes to a suitable successor.
When you don’t plan your estate, your incapacity plan will be defined by a 
court, and your estate will be carved up according to state law. The result 
may be far different from what you desire.
Planning for your care while you’re alive
In addition to planning for the distribution of your assets after you die, a 
complete estate plan looks at what will happen to your estate if an accident 
or illness leaves you unable to properly care for yourself.
Your incapacity plan includes your durable power of attorney, healthcare 
proxy, and living will:
 
 Your durable power of attorney appoints an attorney-in-fact who can 
make financial decisions for you if you become incapacitated.
 
 Your healthcare proxy appoints a healthcare advocate who can help you 
make medical decisions if you’re unable to make or communicate those 
decisions yourself.
 
 Your living will describes what care you want to receive, and don’t want 
to receive, during the final days of your life.

12
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
If you don’t appoint people to help with your medical and financial needs, your 
family may have to go to court to have somebody appointed to make decisions 
for you. Your loved ones will face unnecessary burdens and confusion:
 
 Your family will have to go to court to have somebody appointed to 
manage your personal and financial needs, at a time when they’re 
already under stress due to your incapacity.
 
 The court won’t know who you’d prefer to assist with your medical and 
financial decisions, and may appoint somebody who you would find 
unacceptable.
 
 Your helpers won’t know your wishes or the limits you’d impose on 
their choices if you were able to communicate them. They’ll have to try 
to guess what you would have wanted.
 
The impact of these choices may be profound. Whatever your plans, with a 
court-appointed guardian supervising your medical care, you’re more likely to 
undergo more intrusive medical care and to spend your last days in a hospital 
or nursing home. (Chapter 14 discusses incapacity planning in more detail.)
Ensuring that your assets 
go where you want
When you plan your estate, you pick your heirs and decide how much you 
want to leave to them. Although state laws do restrict your ability to disinherit 
certain heirs, especially your spouse, for the most part you can leave your 
money to family, friends, schools and charities, or anybody else you choose.
In defining your bequests, you may choose to simply distribute your assets 
to your heirs upon your death. But you may also choose to be very creative 
in how you distribute your assets.
 
 You can defer your bequests to a later date (for example, “When my son 
turns 25”).
 
 You can mete out your gifts in installments (for example, “$20,000 to 
my daughter upon her 18th birthday, $20,000 on her 23rd birthday, and 
$60,000 upon her 30th birthday”).
 
 You can impose conditions on your bequests, requiring your heirs to 
satisfy those conditions before they receive the inheritance (for example, 
“$50,000 to my son upon his graduation from college”).
If you don’t plan your estate, the state will make all those choices for you. Your 
estate will go to your heirs according to your state’s laws of intestate succes-
sion, described later in this chapter in the section “Realizing What Happens If 
You Don’t Have an Estate Plan.” If you have minor children, the probate court 

13
 Chapter 1: Ensuring That Your Last Wishes Are Honored
may appoint a conservator to look after their assets until they turn 18. But any 
adult heir will immediately receive their legally defined inheritance. Your wish 
to support your alma mater or to give to charity? Forget it.
 
The only way to be sure that your assets are distributed the way you want is 
to plan your estate. (Chapters 3 and 4 detail the process of collecting informa-
tion about your assets and planning your bequests.)
Looking Out for Common Pitfalls
Everybody makes mistakes, but some mistakes get made a lot. Actions that 
may seem like they’ll simplify your estate may in fact make it more compli-
cated, burden your ability to use and enjoy your own assets, or increase the 
tax burden to your estate and heirs.
At the same time, once you understand the common pitfalls, most are pretty 
easy to avoid. You can avoid some mistakes simply by planning your estate 
now, rather than putting it off until your health starts to fail. (For more dis-
cussion of common estate planning mistakes, see Chapters 8 and 18.)
Benefits and dangers of jointly titling real 
estate, property, and bank accounts
A common shortcut to estate planning involves adding your desired heir to 
the title of your real estate, financial account, or other titled asset. You can 
choose between a number of different types of joint ownership, discussed 
in Chapter 17. In all likelihood, when you add somebody as an owner, you’ll 
create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, meaning that they automati-
cally inherit your share if you die before them.
Some huge risks can arise from joint ownership of a home. Take a common 
example, where you add your child to the deed as a joint tenant:
 
 Your son gets divorced, and his wife asks the divorce court to award 
him half of “his share” of your house.
 
 Your son may decide that the home is “more than you can handle” and 
ask a court to force the sale of the property.
 
 Your son decides to move in. It’s his home too, isn’t it?
 
 Your son suffers financial problems or doesn’t pay his taxes, and his 
creditors or the IRS try to collect against “his share.”
Also, adding a joint owner can increase that person’s capital gains tax expo-
sure when the property is eventually sold.

14
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Other issues may also arise:
 
 What happens if you can no longer afford to support your home, or are no 
longer physically able to care for it, but your child won’t agree to a sale?
 
 What happens if you want to refinance your mortgage to improve the 
property, get a better interest rate, or withdraw equity from your home, 
but your child refuses to cooperate?
 
 What if you want to sell your house and move into a smaller home or 
condo, but your child wants to keep “the family home?”
 
 What happens if you have to move into a long-term care facility?
 
When you give up your full ownership interest, you run the risk that your 
children will suddenly decide that they know what is best for you, and prevent 
you from making perfectly reasonable decisions relating to your own home.
Similar issues arise with joint ownership of bank accounts. As the law pre-
sumes that both you and your joint account holder have equal rights to the 
money, your co-account holder may empty the account. His creditors may 
try to garnish the account to satisfy his debts. If it truly is a joint account, 
with both of you contributing toward the balance, the IRS will still try to 
include the entire account balance in your taxable estate, and your child will 
have to prove to the IRS that he contributed part of the money and that his 
contribution should not be taxed.
 
Possible alternatives to joint ownership include the use of a living trust, or 
transfer-on-death titles and accounts. (Part III discusses living trusts. For dis-
cussion of joint ownership of real estate, see Chapter 17.)
Benefits and dangers of life estates
You own your home, and you want your children to inherit your home. So how 
about a life estate? In a life estate, you retain the right to use and control your 
home for the rest of your life, and you provide for your ownership of your home 
to pass to specific people upon your death. You’re called the life tenant, and the 
people who eventually receive your home are your remaindermen. Although I’m 
speaking in terms of your marital home, you can create a life estate for other 
property as well, which is called a retained life estate.
In a typical arrangement, once you create a life estate, you retain the exclusive 
right to the use and possession of your home. You pay the day-to-day expenses 
of your home, including routine maintenance, homeowner’s insurance, and 
property taxes. You pay the interest on the mortgage, but your remaindermen 
pay the portion of the mortgage payment that goes to the principal balance.

15
 Chapter 1: Ensuring That Your Last Wishes Are Honored
As a life tenant, you face the same type of dependence upon the goodwill and 
cooperation of your remaindermen as you do with joint ownership (see pre-
ceding section). You need your remaindermen’s consent to refinance or sell 
your home, and difficulties can arise if you become unable to pay the home’s 
ongoing expenses.
A life estate may also appeal to you if you have children from a prior mar-
riage who you wish to eventually inherit your home, but want your current 
spouse to be able to live in your home following your death. You can provide 
in your estate plan for your spouse to receive a life estate in your home, with 
your children as the remaindermen. But consider the consequences:
 
 Say that you’re considerably older than your spouse. You die at age 82, 
and your spouse is 63. At this time, your children are nearing retire-
ment age. If your spouse lives for another 20 years, your children will be 
elderly by the time they inherit your home. By then, they may have little 
need for an inheritance.
 
 Your spouse may neglect the property, causing your children to have 
to pay insurance, taxes, and repairs and possibly having to take your 
spouse to court.
“My children wouldn’t do that to me”
You probably have thought at one time or 
another that your offspring would never do any 
of these awful scenarios to you. While other 
people may have children who will abuse joint 
ownership or empty a joint bank account, your 
children would never do such a thing. You know 
what? You’re probably right. The worst abuses 
happen in exceptional cases, and most children 
try to respect their parents’ wishes. But not all 
the problems arise from malice.
Your child may encounter financial troubles. 
It’s easy to “borrow” a car payment or a house 
payment from your joint bank account. Maybe 
your child even repays the loan the first time 
or two. But then she finds herself having bor-
rowed two or three payments. Then four. And 
before she even appreciates what she’s doing, 
she’s “borrowed” far more of your money than 
she can realistically pay back. Do you sue your 
child? Call the police? The odds are that you 
won’t. You’ll suffer a strain in your relationship 
and have a less comfortable retirement than 
you had previously expected.
On the flipside, your child may be far more con-
cerned with your financial stability than you 
are. Every time you make a purchase, your child 
may be demanding to know what you spent “all 
that money on” and “did you really need it.” I 
recently encountered a case where a child 
emptied out her mother’s joint bank account, not 
because her mother was spending inappropri-
ately but because the daughter was afraid she 
might. She didn’t approve of her mother’s new 
boyfriend and was concerned that her mother 
might make excessive gifts.

16
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
 
 You may create acrimony between your spouse and your children, who 
see your spouse as standing in the way of “their inheritance.”
 
 Your spouse may remarry. Do you want to subsidize your spouse’s new 
family?
 
An alternative? Keep your house in a trust for five to ten years, or whatever 
other time period you desire, and let your spouse have full use and enjoyment of 
it during that period. Then have your trust convey your house to your children.
Danger of subjecting an asset 
to Medicaid spend-down rules
Medicare is a federal health insurance program that provides payment for 
certain hospital and medical expenses for people aged 65 and older. But as 
you age, you face a huge potential expense that Medicare doesn’t ordinarily 
cover: long-term care.
If you’re wealthy enough, lucky enough, or hold sufficient long-term care 
insurance, you may not need to worry about the cost of your long-term care. 
But most people, even those with some insurance, can face significant finan-
cial hardship from the high cost of residential care.
This is where Medicaid comes in. Medicaid is an additional federal program 
that covers medical costs, including the cost of long-term care, if you’re 
financially unable to pay for that care yourself.
But before you can qualify for Medicaid, spend-down rules apply. If you have 
too much income or too many assets, you won’t qualify for Medicaid until 
your income or assets are spent down to a qualifying level. The goal here is 
to make you pay for your own care before the government takes over, while 
still protecting you and your family from becoming impoverished by the 
costs of long-term care. Note that spend-down rules don’t require that your 
assets be spent on your medical care, but you do face restrictions on how 
you can spend your excess money without affecting your qualification for 
Medicaid.
What if you give your assets away instead of spending them? Can you 
qualify for Medicaid? That’s where look back rules kick in. When you apply 
for Medicaid benefits to pay for long-term care, the government examines 
your financial transactions over the past five years to determine whether 
you’ve transferred assets out of your estate. If you have, the government will 
impose a penalty period before you can qualify for Medicaid benefits. Any 
gifts, including payment of tuition for an adult child, charitable donations, 
and even Christmas presents, can trigger a penalty period for long-term care 
benefits.

17
 Chapter 1: Ensuring That Your Last Wishes Are Honored
You benefit from a modest Medicaid exemption for income and savings. But 
you may benefit from a large exemption in the form of your home. If you’re in 
a nursing home but are expected to return to your own home, your home is 
exempt from the spend-down rules. Note that if you stay in a nursing home 
for six months or longer, Medicaid assumes that you won’t return home. 
Also, if you’re married, as long as your spouse remains in your home, it’s 
exempt from spend-down rules.
So how do you accidentally lose your exemptions? Usually in one of two ways:
 
 You don’t understand the exemptions and believe that the government 
will take your house no matter what. You transfer title to an heir, prob-
ably your children. Your home is no longer yours, and the government 
will apply spend-down rules to its fair market value.
 
 You aren’t even thinking about Medicaid. You decide that the easiest 
way to leave your home to your heirs is to add them to the title, giving 
them outright ownership. The transfer of an interest in your home 
for less than fair market value during the look-back period can trigger 
spend-down rules or penalties.
Traditionally, people often used life estates to try to avoid Medicaid spend-
down rules. The value of a life estate isn’t counted toward your assets when 
you apply for Medicaid benefits. But states are eager to recover Medicaid 
expenses and are increasingly imposing liens against the property a Medicaid 
recipient has placed into a life estate.
One more thing to consider: Even when an exemption applies during your 
lifetime, the state may seek to recoup its costs by imposing a lien against 
your property after your death.
Your best approach is to engage in estate planning long before you end up 
in long-term care. If you plan for your long-term care needs and implement 
an asset protection strategy before the Medicaid look-back period begins, 
you can minimize the effect of spend-down rules and recoupment policies on 
your estate.
 
If you believe you or your spouse will require Medicaid benefits later in life, 
you can consult a lawyer who specializes in Medicaid planning. Your lawyer 
can help you create a strategy to minimize the effects of Medicaid’s spend-
down and look-back rules, as well as helping you avoid or minimize liens 
Medicaid may attempt to assert against your estate after you die.
Potential for increased tax exposure
Most people won’t pay federal estate tax. The current estate tax exemption 
is $2 million, and the estate tax is scheduled to be totally repealed in 2010. 

18
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
But the law repealing estate taxes is scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. 
Most people expect that Congress will pass a new law sometime in 2009 that 
restores an estate tax, but with an exemption set somewhere between $1.5 
million and $4 million.
 
The estate tax is substantial. Above the exemption, the current estate tax rate 
is 45 percent. If your estate is large enough to pay estate taxes and you do no 
advance planning, the government may turn out to be your biggest beneficiary.
Realizing What Happens If You 
Don’t Have an Estate Plan
Are there drawbacks to not planning your estate? Yes, and some of them 
are big.
If you have a large estate, you will maximize your estate tax liability (see the 
preceding section). But in addition to the possibility that you’ll increase the 
government’s cut, you have two huge reasons to have an estate plan:
 
 If you don’t plan your estate, the government will decide who inherits 
your assets.
 
 If you don’t designate a custodian for your minor children, the state will 
pick somebody for you.
You may enjoy many smaller benefits as well, including picking the person 
who will administer your estate and providing instructions for your funeral 
and memorial service. If you don’t draft a will, others will make those choices 
for you.
Following the laws of intestate succession
If you don’t make an estate plan for yourself, the state has already made one 
for you. State laws of intestate succession define who inherits the property of 
people who die without a will. Typically, your surviving spouse will receive 
half of your estate, with the remainder divided between your children. If you 
have no surviving spouse or children, your estate is distributed by formula to 
other surviving members of your family.
In some cases, the state’s plan for your assets may be very similar to your 
own. In others, it will be wildly different. But the only way to be certain that 
your estate is distributed the way you want is to create an estate plan.

19
 Chapter 1: Ensuring That Your Last Wishes Are Honored
Even if you plan your estate, intestate succession laws may apply to some of 
your assets in the following situations:
 
 You forget to include an asset in your estate plan.
 
 You direct an asset to an heir through your living trust, but forget to 
transfer ownership of the asset into your trust.
 
 After all of your bequests are made, you’ll almost certainly have some-
thing left over in your estate, even if just a small amount of cash or your 
clothing and personal effects.
 
You should include a residuary clause in your will, describing how any assets 
left in your estate are to be distributed after all specific bequests have been 
made. That way, all your assets will be distributed consistent with your own 
wishes, and not through choices the state makes for you.
Determining the custodian 
of your minor children
Although uncommon, tragedy can strike your family and kill both you and 
your spouse. Families tend to travel together, so a terrible car accident or 
plane crash could leave your children as orphans.
If you draft a will, you may designate custodians for your minor children. 
You can pick people you trust to care for your children and raise them in a 
manner you approve. If you want, you can designate one person to care for 
your children, and another person to manage their money.
Although courts aren’t bound by your designation, judges usually defer to a 
parent’s wishes. But if you don’t make a choice, the judge will pick somebody 
for you. That person or persons could be
 
 Your in-laws, who were abusive to your spouse throughout her childhood
 
 Your sister, whose husband was adamantly opposed to caring for your 
children until he learned about their Social Security survivor’s benefits
 
 Your cousin, who has never been able to manage money but will now be 
responsible for overseeing your children’s inheritance
Granted, often the court will make a good decision and pick somebody who 
will provide excellent care for your children. But why take the chance?
 
Even if you’re divorced from the other parent, you can designate a guardian. 
That way, you don’t have to update your will if something happens to their other 
parent. If you have custody of your children and have serious concerns about 
the other parent’s ability to properly care for them if something happens to you, 

20
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
you can include with your will an explanation of why you’d prefer somebody else 
to take custody of your children. Although courts will almost always give cus-
tody to a surviving parent, as that’s typically what the law requires, you will at 
least make the court aware of your concerns.
Issues you may face in providing for your children and dependents are dis-
cussed in Chapter 5.
Creating Your Will or Trust
If you’re reading this book, you’re probably considering drafting your own 
estate plan. If you don’t expect to owe estate taxes, don’t want to disinherit 
your spouse or child, and have the time to work through the process, you 
should be able to do it yourself. But if you lack the time or inclination, have 
a very large estate, are disinheriting an heir, are the owner of a business, or 
have a complicated plan for the distribution of your estate, you’ll almost 
certainly benefit from professional estate planning services.
Whatever you decide, your understanding of the estate planning process 
will help you. It’s essential to planning your own estate, but it will also help 
you understand your own needs and communicate your wishes to an estate 
planning professional.
Deciding who should create it
As you embark upon the estate planning process, you need to ask yourself, 
are you able to plan your entire estate yourself? You may discover that
 
 You’re capable, but don’t have sufficient time or interest to go through 
the process of planning your estate.
 
 You can plan the bulk of your estate, but require some specialized estate 
planning services that should be performed by a lawyer.
 
 Whether due to the size and complexity of your estate, or your own 
discomfort with the process, you should hire a professional to plan 
your estate.
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with getting help with your estate plan. 
Most lawyers I know don’t plan their own estates. It’s not a matter of ability, 
as most are capable of figuring out what they would need to do. It’s a matter 
of getting things done quickly, and getting the benefit of an expert’s advice 
and knowledge.

21
 Chapter 1: Ensuring That Your Last Wishes Are Honored
Although you may cringe at the thought of paying money to a lawyer, remem-
ber that your time is valuable. How many hours of your time do you want 
to spend learning the intricacies of estate tax law or business succession, 
when an experienced estate planning lawyer will be able to do a better job in 
a fraction of the time, by dint of experience? And if you make a mistake, the 
increased capital gains tax, income tax, and estate tax exposure will probably 
dwarf the cost of professional estate planning services.
For more guidance on working with estate planning professionals and figur-
ing out when you need an expert, see Chapter 2.
 
The state of Louisiana has chosen to make it very difficult to draft your own 
will. The steps you must take to execute a valid will are the most complicated 
in the nation. But that’s not all. The state’s forced heirship laws mandate mini-
mum bequests to certain heirs and restrict your right to reduce their bequests 
or disinherit them. You can create what by all appearances is a valid, properly 
executed will, yet still have the state restructure your bequests to your heirs. 
Pretty much everybody in Louisiana, including most lawyers, should have a 
professional draft their will.
Understanding the process
Planning your estate can be a big job, but it’s something you can handle. 
Approach the process step-by-step:
 
1. Gather your facts.
 
 Take stock of your personal situation, including where you live, who 
lives with you, your extended family, and other potential heirs, including 
friends and charities.
 
 Take a thorough look at your assets, determining what you own, how 
you own it, and what it’s worth. Also review your debts, including what 
you owe and who you owe it to.
 
 This process is covered in Chapter 3.
 
2. Determine your estate planning needs.
 
 Ask yourself the following questions:
 
• You need a will, but do you also need a living trust?
 
• Do you want to use other trusts, to delay or structure inheritances, 
or to protect your heirs?
 
• Will your estate owe estate taxes? How complex does your estate 
planning strategy need to be? Do you also need a gifting strategy, 
to transfer wealth to your heirs during your lifetime?

22
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
 
• Do you own your own business? What sort of business succession 
plan do you need?
 
• What other special circumstances do you need to address? For 
example, do you have children from a prior relationship? Do you 
want to disinherit an heir?
 
•  Who will serve as your helpers? Your personal representative man-
ages your estate in probate court, pays your bills and taxes, and 
oversees your funeral and burial arrangements. Your trustee man-
ages, controls, and distributes assets held in your trust. Your minor 
children need a custodian to take care of them if something happens 
to you, and perhaps a second person to take care of their money.
 
• If you’re creating a trust, what property do you want to put into 
your trust?
 
• How will you leave your assets to your heirs? Will they receive 
their inheritances immediately, or will they be held in trust until 
some point in time in the future? Will any of your gifts be condi-
tional, with your heirs only receiving their inheritance when a 
condition (such as college graduation) is met?
 
• How will your estate pay its bills and expenses? Do you have enough 
money available to pay your debts and taxes, pay for the administra-
tion of your estate and trust, and cover funeral expenses? Should 
you carry some life insurance to cover those costs?
 
 This process is described in Chapter 4.
 
3. Prepare your will and living trust, making sure that you address all 
your major assets, including those with sentimental value.
 
 For some assets, you’ll want to designate contingent beneficiaries, in 
case an heir dies before you do or declines an inheritance.
 
 You will also include a residuary clause, directing how any assets left in 
your estate will be distributed after all your specific gifts have been made.
 
 For guidance on drafting your will, see Part II of this book. Trusts are 
covered in Part III.
 
4. Execute your estate planning documents to give them legal effect, 
obtaining proper witness signatures and notarization.
 
 You can execute your documents as you complete them or, if you prefer, 
as you complete each document. Guidance for executing your will is 
provided in Chapter 7 and Appendix A. Instruction for executing your 
trust is found in Chapter 11.

23
 Chapter 1: Ensuring That Your Last Wishes Are Honored
 
5. Lather, rinse, repeat.
 
 You’ll review your estate plan on a regular basis, perhaps annually (and 
not less than once every few years), to make sure that it still suits your 
needs.
 
 You’ll also review your estate plan when you experience major changes 
in your life, including moving to another state, marriage, divorce, sepa-
ration, childbirth or adoption, significant change in your financial situa-
tion, or the death of an heir.
 
 For information on reviewing and updating your will, see Chapter 9. 
Guidance for updating your revocable living trust is provided in 
Chapter 13.
Throughout this process, ask yourself whether it’s realistic for you to plan 
your estate yourself. You can manage a will and living trust, but tax planning, 
business succession planning, more complicated trusts, or complicated plans 
for the distribution of your assets can change that. So can state laws, particu-
larly if you want to leave your spouse less than the law requires, or if you live 
in Louisiana.
Thinking about your kids, money, 
life insurance, and more
You need a plan for your incapacity. That plan may include a living trust, 
granting the trustee authority over the trust’s assets if something happens to 
you. But you should also prepare a durable power of attorney and healthcare 
proxy and should consider a living will (see Chapter 14).
If you own a business, you probably need a business succession plan. This 
plan has two major components. First, how do you convey your business to 
your heirs while minimizing capital gains taxes and estate taxes, and second, 
who will take control of your business and manage it if you die or become 
incapacitated. Without a good succession plan, you risk that your business 
will collapse (see Chapter 4).
Do you have retirement accounts? As with your life insurance policies, 
they’ll typically pass to a named beneficiary instead of going through your 
estate. Have you considered what rollover rights your beneficiary may enjoy? 
Inheritance of tax-deferred retirement savings can be more valuable to an 
heir who can roll those savings into his own retirement accounts instead of 
having to immediately pay taxes (see Chapter 15).

24
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Do you have life insurance? Take a look at who owns the policy, and who you 
have named as beneficiaries. Ownership will affect whether or not your insur-
ance proceeds are included in your taxable estate. Your beneficiaries will 
receive the proceeds outside of probate, meaning that your beneficiary des-
ignation controls who receives the money even if your will says something 
else. When you review and update your will, you should also review and 
update your life insurance beneficiaries (see Chapter 16).
How will your estate pay its bills? Do you have enough cash assets, or invest-
ments that can be liquidated to pay the costs of your estate? Do you need 
to have life insurance to help cover those costs? If so, will the insurance 
proceeds be subject to estate taxes, and can those taxes be avoided? (See 
Chapter 6 on the costs of estate administration and estate taxes.)
Will your estate have to pay estate taxes? Are you unsure? If your estate 
will owe estate taxes you will almost always benefit from professional 
estate planning services. Estate taxes are so high that in the long run those 
services will typically pay for themselves several times over. (See Chapter 6 
on estate taxes.)
How do you keep your estate planning documents safe? How can you be 
sure that your personal representative can find your will, or that it won’t 
be lost or destroyed? See the suggestions on safeguarding your estate plan 
in Chapter 2.

Chapter 2
Making Crucial Decisions
In This Chapter
 Choosing between planning your own estate or hiring a lawyer
 Figuring out whether you should go with a will or trust
 Working with professionals
 Protecting your original documents
A
s you begin the estate planning process, your first task is to decide how 
much help you need. Can you plan your entire estate yourself? Do you 
need help and, if so, how much? Or are you better off simply hiring a profes-
sional? Your choices will depend upon the complexity of your estate and 
your comfort with the estate planning process.
This chapter also explains what wills and trusts are and how they fit into 
your estate plan. You find out how to work with an estate planning profes-
sional, how to protect your will or trust, and who should have a copy.
Going It Alone
Some estate planning books are full of warnings that you should not attempt 
to plan your estate without getting help from a lawyer. I’m working from the 
assumption that you understand that planning your own estate may be dif-
ficult, but you intend to try. You’re the only one who knows your limitations 
and abilities.
Are you the type who hires an accountant to prepare your 1040-EZ? Then 
estate planning will probably prove to be daunting. Do you eschew profes-
sionals and tax software, instead delving into tax instruction pamphlets 
and paper forms? Then this is probably right up your alley. Most people fall 
somewhere in the middle. If you’re comfortable doing your own taxes, you’re 
probably up to the job of planning your own estate.

26
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
It’s never fun to open your wallet to pay an estate planning professional. Yet 
this book would not be complete if I did not help you understand:
 
 When planning your estate might exceed your abilities
 
 When it makes sense to have part of your estate plan created by a lawyer
 
 When your use of an estate planning professional can save you (or your 
estate) time and even money
There is wisdom in knowing your own limitations and recognizing when you 
need assistance from an estate planning professional.
Are you comfortable doing it yourself?
The first question is one that only you can answer: Are you comfortable cre-
ating your own estate plan? Drafting a will is easier than drafting a revocable 
living trust. Drafting a revocable living trust is easier than drafting a bypass 
trust. If you add enough conditions and caveats, you can make drafting pretty 
much any document impossibly complicated.
How complicated is your estate?
The estate planning process can be as easy or as difficult as you make it. 
I have seen some very complicated estate plans for small, simple estates. 
Factors that may complicate your estate plan include planning for a large 
estate and estate tax issues; business ownership; marriage, children, and 
remarriage; and delaying or controlling distribution of inheritances after 
your death.
 
Some factors that complicate your estate are beyond your control. Others, 
you create. As much as possible, try to keep it simple.
If you’re so comfortable, why haven’t you done it?
Has this book been sitting on a shelf for six 
months, and you’re just now cracking the cover 
for the first time? Did you eagerly start reading 
the day you bought this book, but weeks later 
have yet to start organizing to draft your will?
Perhaps you’re capable, but you’re procrastinat-
ing. Perhaps you’re intimidated or overwhelmed. 
Either way, consider giving yourself a deadline 
to get started. If you don’t meet your deadline, 
perhaps it’s time to hire a professional.

27
 Chapter 2: Making Crucial Decisions
Large estates
For this chapter, when I refer to a large estate, I mean an estate that will 
incur estate taxes. If your estate is large, or you expect that your estate will 
be large when you die, your estate inevitably becomes more complicated. 
Consider estate taxes:
 
 If you try to avoid estate taxes by making gifts during your lifetime, you 
have to consider gift tax issues, as well as the impact on your heirs’ tax-
able basis in gifts you make to them. (See Chapters 6 and 21 on estate 
taxes.)
 
 If you try to avoid estate taxes through trusts, you must select the 
proper trusts, make sure that they’re in proper form, choose appropri-
ate trustees, and fund your trusts. If you make errors, the consequences 
can be serious. For example, the assets you intend to convey by trust 
may be treated as part of your taxable estate, or you may accidentally 
trigger generation skipping taxes on top of estate taxes. (See Chapter 12 
on trusts.)
 
 If you try to avoid estate taxes through charitable giving, you have many 
choices to make. Do you want to begin your charitable giving during 
your lifetime — for example, by using a charitable remainder trust to 
generate income or tax savings? Should you make charitable donations 
by bequest? (See Chapter 6 on estate taxes and Chapter 12 on trusts.)
 
If your estate is very large — $20 million or more — good tax planning may 
save your estate a small fortune in taxes. But the types of estate planning tools 
a professional will recommend and implement will often be very complex and 
aggressive and may come under intense scrutiny from the IRS. Planning your 
estate is not realistically a do-it-yourself project.
Business assets
Do you ever wish you had a day job? If you own your own business or are a 
partner in a privately owned business, you have worked very hard to build 
your business.
 
 If you don’t plan for estate taxes, your estate may have difficulty cover-
ing the tax bill. In some cases, your business may be sold or liquidated 
to cover your tax bill. (See Chapter 6 on estate taxes.)
 
 If you don’t plan for business succession, who will manage your busi-
ness when you’re gone? In the event of death or disability, can your 
business even access its accounts to pay its bills, let alone continue its 
daily operations? Will your business close for want of new management? 
Will your heirs fight for control? (See the discussion in Chapter 4 on 
estate planning for your business.)

28
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
You need a management succession plan to cover not only the tax and finan-
cial aspects of business succession, but also practical issues in picking your 
successor and avoiding family conflict. As a business owner, even if you’re 
capable of researching every aspect of your estate and creating your own 
business succession plan, I doubt that you have the time.
An estate planning lawyer can help you devise a strategy that includes suc-
cession planning and estate tax avoidance. He can balance estate taxes 
against capital gains taxes and often structure business stock to minimize its 
value to your estate, without impairing its value to your heirs.
If you own shares in a small business, you have issues beyond leaving your 
shares to your heirs. If you or one of your partners dies, think about the 
following:
 
 Who will inherit their shares, and will that person (or those people) have 
the right to participate in the business?
 
 If the business has the right to buy the shares from a deceased partner’s 
estate, how will you determine their value? How will the business afford 
the shares? Will buying the shares create cash flow problems?
 
You and your partners should have a buy-sell agreement that addresses these 
issues, as well as related issues that may arise during your lifetimes.
Family issues
You may not want to believe it, but the way you treat your family in your estate 
plan can overshadow a lifetime of love and support. Your bequests will probably 
be seen as an expression of approval or disapproval, of love or rejection.
You may have very good reasons for you to give your children different 
inheritances or disinheriting a child. But you must do so in a manner that is 
legally effective, and you will probably want to do so in a way that minimizes 
the likelihood of a family rift.
If you’re married but have children from a prior relationship, you need to 
consider how you will divide your estate between your spouse and children. 
This decision gets even more complicated if you have children with your cur-
rent spouse or if you have stepchildren who will inherit your spouse’s estate. 
If you die first, how much of your estate will go to your stepchildren instead 
of your children? For more discussion of estate planning issues arising from 
second families, please consult Chapter 4.
Although the story of Howard Hughes is fading from popular memory, you 
may be surprised that he died without a will. Hearing that, you will probably 
not be surprised that a decade long legal battle ensued over his $6 billion 
estate. The estate of a man who, at least officially, was long divorced and 
never had children was besieged by claims from people claiming to be his 
wives and children.

29
 Chapter 2: Making Crucial Decisions
 
If you may have children from prior relationships or believe somebody may be 
tempted to falsely claim to be your child to try to grab a share of your estate, 
you need to anticipate that possibility in your estate plan. If a court concludes 
that you omitted a child from your will, that child may end up with the largest 
inheritance of any of your children, and perhaps any of your heirs.
Choosing a Will or Trust for Your Estate
The revocable living trust is probably the most heavily marketed estate plan-
ning tool in history. You create this trust during your lifetime and may amend 
or revoke it as you wish. The trust becomes irrevocable upon your death, 
and the trust’s assets are distributed according to your instructions. For 
details on living trusts, see Part III of this book.
Marketing materials may leave you with the impression that everybody needs 
a living trust. By comparison, a will may seem ordinary. Don’t be fooled. Your 
will is a failsafe for your estate plan. You may not need a trust, but you do 
need a will.
What a will can do for you
A will is the easiest tool to direct your assets to your beneficiaries. Your pro-
bate estate includes the property owned by you at the time of your death.
Your will designates the personal representative (executor) for your estate. If 
you wish, most states permit you to waive any bond that your personal rep-
resentative is otherwise required to post under state law.
You can use your will to create a trust, often called a testamentary trust, to hold 
and distribute some or all of your assets. You can also provide that part of 
your estate, or the balance of your estate after your bequests, will go into an 
existing trust. A will that funds an existing trust is known as a pour-over will.
If you have minor children, you should designate a custodian for your chil-
dren in your will. A court will review your designation and confirm that it is 
consistent with your children’s needs, but courts usually defer to a parents’ 
preference. You can designate the same person, or if you prefer a different 
person, to act as custodian of your children’s assets. (For more on providing 
for your dependents, see Chapter 5.)
 
Some of your assets, such as insurance and financial accounts with designated 
beneficiaries, or the assets you have transferred into your living trust, are not 
included in your probate estate and thus are not affected by your will.

30
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
What a trust can do for you
There are many different types of trust, each of which potentially provides a 
different set of benefits to your estate. Potential benefits of estate planning 
with trusts include avoiding probate, increased privacy, avoiding taxes, suc-
cession planning for your family business, and controlling the distribution of 
your estate. Among the trusts you may consider
 
 A revocable living trust is an excellent tool to plan for incapacity and the 
distribution of your assets, but is a poor tool for avoiding estate taxes.
 
 Charitable trusts and insurance trusts may help you avoid estate taxes, but 
are not of themselves tools for distributing assets to your heirs.
 
 Asset protection trusts can help protect your financially troubled heirs 
from losing their inheritance to creditors.
The most popular trust is the revocable living trust. You transfer ownership 
of your assets into a trust that becomes active upon your death or legal inca-
pacity. At that time, a trustee who you picked manages your estate consis-
tent with instructions you included in your trust. After you die, trust assets 
are distributed to your heirs without going through probate. (Chapter 12 
describes a wide variety of trusts commonly used in estate planning.)
Trusts give you great flexibility in planning bequests. For example, you can 
delay the age at which your children inherit assets, provide income and sup-
port for your heirs prior to distributing the bulk of your estate, or provide an 
inheritance in several installments.
You may benefit from having both
If you do not have a will to back up your trust, anything that isn’t included 
in your trust will go through probate. Those assets will pass by the laws of 
intestate succession, meaning that the court will determine who inherits your 
estate and what they inherit by state law.
Even if you carefully convey ownership of your property into a living trust, 
you will have personal property when you die. You will have clothes in your 
closet, cash in your wallet, and other items of personal property that must 
be conveyed to your heirs. You can use a will to do that, or you can use your 
will to direct your remaining property into your trust.
In many cases, significant assets are never transferred into a living trust. I 
have even encountered a very expensive, professionally prepared estate plan 
where nothing had been transferred into the trust. The trust was a thing of 
beauty, but the entire estate went through probate.

31
 Chapter 2: Making Crucial Decisions
 
The choice is thus not between a will and a living trust. Your estate plan 
should include a will. You may benefit from also having a trust.
Going with a Pro
When you start planning your estate you may find that you lack the time to put 
together the estate plan you want. You may find the process daunting or confus-
ing. You may find it incredibly boring. Whatever your reason, if you’re unable to 
complete your own estate plan, you should not hesitate to hire a professional.
An estate planning practice involves knowledge of a significant number of 
legal disciplines, including:
 
 Wills and trusts
 
 State and federal tax law
 
 The law of business organizations
 
 Medicare and Medicaid law
 
 Real and personal property law
In addition, estate planning requires knowledge of financial matters, including 
insurance and annuities, asset valuation, and retirement plans and pensions.
 
Nobody, not even a great estate planning lawyer, can master every aspect 
of estate planning. Even lawyers may employ outside professionals to assist 
them with complicated estates.
How lawyers and accountants can help
Lawyers and accountants can help you get a realistic view of your estate 
and finances. They can help you assess which estate planning tools will best 
serve your goals for:
 
 Avoiding taxes during your life
 
 Your business
 
 Your retirement
 
 Disability and the cost of long-term care
 
 Your estate and heirs

32
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
An experienced estate planning lawyer will understand the problems that can 
result from your estate plan and can help you identify and avoid similar prob-
lems as you plan your estate. That includes potential conflict within your 
family or between your heirs.
I’m not suggesting that you need or want all the services that estate planning 
professionals provide. But you don’t have to do everything yourself. Even 
if you’re doing the bulk of your estate plan yourself, you may find that you 
need some professional services to fully and properly complete your plan.
Do you save money in the long haul?
When planning your estate, you can save money in two ways:
 
 You can avoid the expense of hiring a professional to help you review your 
options, determine what estate planning tools you need, drafting your 
estate planning documents, and help you transfer assets into your trusts.
 
 You can create a strategy that helps you avoid expenses and taxes after 
your estate plan is created. That strategy can help you avoid capital 
gains taxes and gift taxes during your lifetime, as well as estate taxes to 
be paid after you die.
 
If you value your time, consider this: You’re investing considerable time and 
energy in learning how to plan your estate, and you will invest even more in 
implementing your estate plan. The more complicated your estate plan, the 
more likely it becomes that it will require significant future revision.
When you choose between hiring a professional and planning your own 
estate, keep the following points in mind:
 
 No matter how much research you do, a good lawyer may suggest 
approaches to estate planning that haven’t occurred to you.
 
 Some firms offer periodic reviews of clients’ estate plans at a reasonable 
cost, or discount their work when updating an estate plan.
 
 Some firms will automatically notify you of changes in the law that affect 
your estate plan, reducing the risk that part of your plan will be invalid.
Also, you get two forms of insurance if you have a professional prepare your 
estate plan. The first is figurative: No matter how attentive you are, you have 
a much lower chance of error when estate planning work is performed by 
somebody who does it for a living. The second is literal: Your estate planning 
firm will carry malpractice insurance, and if a mistake occurs, your estate can 
attempt to recover from that policy.

33
 Chapter 2: Making Crucial Decisions
 
An important caveat: Legal malpractice insurance is voluntary, so you need to 
ask whether your law firm carries insurance. If it doesn’t, go elsewhere.
Pricing for estate planning services is not uniform. Some firms charge by the 
hour for all work, usually between $175 and $300 per hour. Some firms offer 
estate planning documents or sets of documents at a fixed fee, with an addi-
tional fee charged for customization. You may find a firm that will quote you 
a fixed fee for your entire customized estate plan.
Some law firms base their fee on the size of your estate. Be cautious, as you 
should be paying for legal work performed. The amount of work performed 
on an estate is only loosely correlated to its size. Also, pricing based on size 
sets up a potential conflict between you and your lawyer over what your 
estate is worth.
 
Find a law firm that provides a lot of estate planning services to people with 
estates similar to your own. If you go to an estate planning firm that primar-
ily serves people who are significantly wealthier than you, you can expect to 
pay a premium, but you won’t necessarily get a better estate plan. If you find 
somebody who does a bit of estate planning as a sideline, you may not get the 
type of advice and assistance you need. A lawyer experienced with clients like 
you will be better able to anticipate and serve your needs.
The most obvious short-term cost of a professional estate plan is the attor-
ney’s fee for creating and executing the plan. Over time, a professional also 
charges fees for updating your estate plan. These expenditures must be 
weighed against the value of your time. And at the end of the day, they must 
be evaluated against potential costs savings in the administration of your 
estate or trust, and the potential cost to your estate of any errors in your 
estate plan.
 
If you expect your estate to be worth more than about $1.5 million, you need 
to think about estate taxes. The estate tax repeal law soon expires, and it’s 
very likely that there will be an estate tax in the future. While I can’t predict 
the exact amount of the exemption, I expect it will be between $1.4 million and 
$4 million. There will be a separate lifetime gift tax exemption that I expect will 
remain lower than the estate tax exemption.
Uncertainty about the future of the estate tax makes it difficult to plan larger 
estates. Although professionals have no greater insight into the future than 
you, they may help you formulate an estate plan that is less likely to require 
substantial amendment when tax laws change.
A professional can also help you plan your estate to minimize other taxes, 
including taxes you may incur during your lifetime.

34
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Working with a Professional
You’ve decided to hire a professional to help plan your estate. But where do 
you find an estate planning lawyer?
 
 Seek referrals from people you know who have hired estate planning 
lawyers.
 
 Contact associations of estate planning specialists. Investigate whether 
your county has an estate planning council and consider hiring a member. 
Nationally, the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel (www.actec.
org) is considered to be a good source of skilled estate planning attorneys.
 
 Check to see whether your state bar has a certification program for 
estate planning lawyers and consult a member lawyer. Similarly, look for 
lawyers who are members of your state or county bar’s estate planning 
committee.
 
 Use a state bar or ABA-approved attorney referral service.
 
 Check the phone book or search on the Internet.
Hiring a lawyer
Once you find some estate planning lawyers to potentially hire, you must 
choose between them. Did I make that sound easy?
While most lawyers can draft simple wills, there’s a lot more than that to 
planning an estate. You want to find a lawyer who is experienced planning 
and settling estates similar to your own. A lawyer experienced at helping cli-
ents with similar personal and financial backgrounds is better able to antici-
pate your needs. A lawyer who has settled estates knows about problems 
that may arise in probate court and with trust administration and can use 
that experience to help you avoid trouble with you own estate plan.
You will want a lawyer who:
 
 Has considerable experience, probably ten or more years, planning estates.
 
 Has a practice that is primarily or exclusively devoted to estate planning 
and probate.
 
 Has an organized, professional office.
If you interview several estate planning lawyers before deciding whom to 
hire, you should let the lawyer know that when you schedule your meet-
ing. You should think of the interview as an opportunity to learn about the 
lawyer. You should not expect any significant advice on your estate plan until 
after you retain your lawyer.

35
 Chapter 2: Making Crucial Decisions
Meeting with your lawyer
After you hire an estate planning lawyer, the law firm will probably provide 
you with questionnaires and checklists to facilitate in the collection of infor-
mation and to inform you of any documents you should bring with you when 
you meet with your lawyer to plan your estate. This information gathering 
process is of the kind described in Chapters 3 and 4.
Complete the forms to the best of your ability and collect the documents 
your lawyer requested. Make a list of your goals for your estate plan, as well 
as your concerns.
This meeting with your lawyer involves the review of your personal and 
family situation, property, and beneficiaries. During the meeting you tell your 
lawyer about your heirs and intended bequests, and you will discuss possible 
personal representatives or trustees.
Reviewing and executing the documents
After your lawyer has completed your estate plan, you must carefully review 
the documents. You should not be surprised if at least one revision is required.
After you approve the documents, your lawyer will arrange for you to sign 
them in front of witnesses and, in most cases, a notary. The danger of invalid 
execution is that a probate court will later invalidate your will. When a lawyer 
arranges this signing ceremony for the execution of your will, there is little 
chance that the execution won’t be valid.
 
Take your time when you review your estate plan. This is not easy reading. 
Even with careful review, you can potentially overlook a mistake or omission. 
Errors that are often overlooked include typos, misspelled names, and the 
omission of a name from a list of heirs (for example, “To my children, Jane, 
Joe, and Jim,” omitting your fourth child, Jillian).
Taking the final steps 
After you sign your estate plan documents, you still have some work to do. If 
your estate includes a living trust, you must transfer assets into your trust. 
The same is true of any other trusts you create, which are to be funded 
during your lifetime. Your lawyer may assist with this process, and in particu-
lar with the preparation of deeds to transfer real estate.
You will need to find an appropriate storage place for your original estate 
planning documents. You may wish to provide a copy of your will to your 
executor, and a copy of your trust to your trustee.

36
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Safeguarding Your Estate Plan
Now that your estate plan is complete, you have a stack of important legal 
documents that must be secured and preserved. How do you protect your 
original trust? How do you store your will so that it is safe from theft or 
destruction, but available for probate?
The problem of the disappearing document
Sometimes a will or trust can’t be easily located. The search for a lost docu-
ment may involve
 
 A thorough search of your home and car. (Yes, some people keep their 
important personal documents in their cars. No, I’m not recommending 
that you do that.)
 
 Examination of your keys, or keys found during the search, to see 
whether any of them might be to a safe deposit box.
 
 Tracking down the lawyer who drafted your will to see whether the law-
yer’s office kept a copy.
 
 Tracking down friends or family members to try to find the witnesses to 
your will.
The danger of multiple originals
Some people, including some lawyers, believe 
that you can help ensure that an original will 
is available for probate by executing more than 
one original copy. This advice is actually a 
recipe for more complicated probate.
It is possible that nobody will be aware that 
there is more than one original, or that nobody 
will bring the issue of duplicates to the atten-
tion of the probate court. But if the probate 
court learns of multiple originals, in most states 
the court will require that all originals be filed 
with the court. If one copy is lost, the court may 
presume that it was destroyed in an act of revo-
cation, requiring your heirs to prove that you did 
not revoke your will.
Some lawyers will ask that you and your wit-
nesses sign more than one copy of a trust or 
will, but will mark or stamp all but one as copies. 
This is the better approach, as there is only one 
original will to submit to the probate court. If the 
original is lost or destroyed, and your heirs have 
to try to probate a copy of your will, a hand-
signed copy is likely to be more convincing to 
the court than a photocopy.

37
 Chapter 2: Making Crucial Decisions
 
 Checking any will registries offered by your state or county government.
 
 Checking the probate court file from your spouse’s estate, if your spouse 
died before you.
This process is far from foolproof. Many lost documents are never located. 
Sometimes the problem is not that you were careless, but that the heir who 
found your will or trust didn’t like its terms and destroyed it.
What if your heirs can’t locate your will or trust?
If your heirs can’t locate your will, your estate will pass through probate, and 
your assets will be distributed as if you died intestate (without a will).
If your heirs find a copy of your will, they may submit it to probate as a lost or 
destroyed will. The exact procedures are different in each state. Typically, the 
probate court will presume that you destroyed your will in order to revoke it.
Your heirs will have to prove to the court that your lost will remains valid 
and the copy they possess is authentic. If possible, your witnesses will testify 
about their recollection of the will and your intentions. If your heirs succeed 
in convincing the court that you did not revoke your will and the copy is 
genuine, the copy of the will is probated as if it were the original.
If your heirs can’t locate your trust, the first question raised is whether you 
had transferred ownership of any property into the trust. If you never funded 
your trust, its absence is of little practical consequence.
If assets were transferred into the trust and a copy of your trust is available, 
under most circumstances your trustee will be able to administer your trust 
based upon the copy. In some circumstances — and in particular if the 
authenticity of the copy is challenged — it may become necessary to have a 
probate court rule on the authenticity of the copy. If your heirs can find the 
trust or a copy, your assets will be probated in accord with your will or your 
state’s laws of intestate succession.
What if an heir destroys your will or trust document?
Often the first person to find your will or trust is one of your heirs. If you 
have disinherited that heir or provided a smaller inheritance than would 
follow from your state’s laws of intestate succession, the heir has an incen-
tive to destroy your original documents. If other copies of your trust exist, 
the loss of the original may not have a significant effect on trust administra-
tion. But the loss of your original will may result in your estate being pro-
bated as if you died intestate (with no will).
 
Keep your will in a location where it is safe from destruction and take steps to 
help ensure that the first person with access to your will is somebody you trust.

38
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Storing your will or trust
You have a number of options for storing your will or trust, some much better 
than others. I’ll skip right over keeping it in a drawer or in the trunk of your car. 
(Because you’re not going to do that. Right?) Possible storage locations include
 
 A fireproof, waterproof lockbox or safe in your home. This is a good place 
to store a will or trust, provided your personal representative or heirs know 
where the lockbox is located and can access the keys or combination.
 
 A safe deposit box. Some lawyers recommend keeping your original estate 
planning documents locked up in a bank vault. There are few places where 
your documents will be better protected from theft, accidental damage, or 
destruction. However, if you keep your will in your safe deposit box, you 
may tie up your estate for weeks while your heirs or personal representa-
tive try to gain access. Locking your original trust away in a safe deposit 
box is reasonable, but make sure that you give a copy to your trustee.
 
 Your lawyer’s office. Many lawyers who offer estate planning services will 
store their clients’ original documents. This can also help keep your will 
safe from destruction, as your lawyer has a duty to safeguard your will 
and to deliver it to the probate court or to your personal representative.
If you’re concerned that the first person to find your estate planning docu-
ments will destroy them, despite the inconvenience it may cause, your safe 
deposit box may be a better option than any storage location in your home. 
Tell your personal representative where you have stored your will, but only 
share that information with friends or family members you trust.
Registration of wills and trusts
In many states, you will be able to register your will with the Secretary of 
State or County Clerk’s office or have it stored in a vault at the probate court. 
The clerk at your probate court can probably describe your options for your 
state and county. There may be a small fee. Although on rare occasion people 
have tried, it is unlikely that somebody will successfully steal your will from a 
probate court or government office.
At times, I have seen private companies offer will storage services. The prob-
lem is, if your heirs don’t know where you’ve registered your will, they won’t 
be able to find it. And even if they do know, using a private company is not 
likely to provide any advantage over your safe deposit box, but presents the 
new problem that the company may go out of business.

In This Chapter
 Getting a big-picture look at your estate
 Taking an inventory of what you own
 Determining the value of your estate
A
s you prepare to plan your estate, you must assemble a great deal of 
information. You need to figure out what is in your estate, including 
both assets and debts. You must consider how your property is held, and 
what it’s worth. You need to figure out who your heirs are, and what you 
want to leave to them.
Your best approach is to methodically work through your relationships and 
finances. This chapter should help you organize your thoughts.
 
A form designed to assist you in the full review of your assets and debts is pro-
vided on the accompanying CD and is included in this book as Appendix C.
Asking Yourself Some Basic Questions
“Who are you?” is a simple question, right? You’re the person reading this 
book, who will soon be writing a will and possibly a trust. You’ll stick your 
name at the top of it, and that’s who you are.
 
Sure, identifying yourself in your will covers the legal formality, but consider 
this point as well: Your will may be your final communication to your loved 
ones. The way you treat your family in your will can color (or discolor) their 
memories of you. So when you think about who you are, think about how your 
will reflects your values, and how your family will react to your bequests.
“Where do you live?” is another easy question. You live in your home, right? 
But what if you have more than one home? If you’re splitting your time 
between residences in different states, which state is your legal residence? 

40
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
That’s the state where your estate will be probated, so you need to plan 
your estate with that state’s laws in mind. (For more discussion of issues 
in real estate ownership, see Chapter 17.)
If you’ve lived in a community property state during your marriage or are 
married and own real estate in a community property state, you must con-
sider the effects of community property laws. (For more discussion of com-
munity property issues, see the section later in this chapter, “Considering 
Community and Jointly Owned Property.”)
In most cases, the people you most want to provide for in your will are the 
people you live with. Typically that’s your spouse and children. You may 
have other family members living with you, or you may be taking care of 
someone else’s child. The manner in which you plan your estate can provide 
them with significant stability or may seriously disrupt their lives.
Beyond your immediate household, who else is in your family? Are there 
family members you help to support? Do you want to provide for them and, 
if so, how?
Identifying Your Assets
As you prepare to plan your estate, you need to take a comprehensive look at 
the following:
 
 What you own
 
 Where it’s located
 
 How it’s owned or titled
Ownership of property is more complicated than you may realize. For most 
of your belongings, ownership is pretty simple. You paid for it, it’s in your 
home, and its yours.
But what if you’re taking care of somebody else’s property? You have cer-
tain legal rights pertaining to the property, but it isn’t yours. Similarly, you 
may be the beneficiary of a trust. The trustee has legal authority over the 
trust assets, but doesn’t own them. You have an interest in the trust assets 
as beneficiary, but you can’t control them. These examples demonstrate the 
concepts of legal interest and beneficial interest. Your legal rights as the cus-
todian of somebody else’s property give you a legal interest in the property, 
but it’s not yours to take. Your status as the beneficiary of a trust gives you a 
beneficial interest in the trust, but it’s not yours to control.

41
 Chapter 3: Gathering Pertinent Information
Your beneficial interest in property can take one of two forms:
 
 A present interest, where you have an immediate right to use the property
 
 A future interest, where you don’t have the right to use the property until 
some time in the future
You may have heard of a life estate. That’s an ownership arrangement where 
one person, the life tenant, has the right to use and enjoy property. When the 
life estate is created, remaindermen are also identified. The remaindermen 
receive ownership of the property upon the death of the life tenant. While the 
life tenant survives, the remaindermen have a future interest in the property. 
Their right to use and enjoy the property is postponed until the death of the 
life tenant.
For example, consider a man who has two children from a prior marriage 
and who wants them to eventually inherit his home. At the same time, he 
wants to be sure that his new wife always has a place to live. He may create 
a life estate in favor of his wife, identifying his children as the remaindermen. 
Following his death, his wife becomes the life tenant. For the rest of her life, 
she enjoys the exclusive right to use and possess the home. Upon her death, 
his children receive ownership of the home.
Finally, your ownership interest in your property may be contingent or vested.
 
 If you have a vested interest in property, you have a fixed right in the 
property. You can sell your interest or give it away. But having a vested 
interest doesn’t of itself mean you have a present interest. Your remain-
der interest in a life estate is vested, but it’s still a future interest. For 
example, if you participate in a pension plan, you probably have to 
work for your employer for a certain number of years before you have a 
vested pension benefit. Once your pension vests, you will receive your 
pension even if you change employers.
 
 If you have a contingent interest in property, your ownership interest 
depends upon something that may or may not happen in the future. For 
example, your parents may have left you an inheritance contingent upon 
your graduating from college. If you never go to college, you will never 
receive that inheritance.
After you inventory your assets, you can determine the value of your estate. 
Sum up the value of your assets, subtract the value of your debts, and that’s 
your net worth. You will also use your inventory to figure out which assets 
should be included in your will or trust, which will automatically pass to a 
beneficiary or joint owner, and how to structure your bequests to serve the 
needs of your heirs.

42
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
You can also determine how your estate will pay its debts and taxes and, for 
larger estates, your approximate estate tax liability. If you have a large estate, 
advance planning is very important. The sooner you take inventory of your 
assets, the sooner you can implement tax-saving strategies.
Your review of your assets should be comprehensive. When planning your 
estate you benefit from having a full understanding of your estate’s assets 
and liabilities, as well as what assets need to be included in your will or trust 
and which will pass to co-owners by operation of law.
Real estate
If you’re like most people, you own some real estate. If you’re a homeowner, 
your home is probably your most valuable asset. You may also own vacation 
property, business or investment property, or other real estate. For each of 
your real estate holdings, take note of
 
 The address
 
 The amount you paid for the property
 
 The cost of improvements you have made
 
 The balance of any outstanding mortgages or unsatisfied liens
 
 Its market value
Do you own your real estate jointly with others? If your co-owners have a 
right of survivorship, they will inherit your share by operation of law, and the 
property doesn’t need to be left to them in your estate plan. (See the section 
“Considering Community and Jointly Owned Property,” later in this chapter, 
for more on joint ownership and community property issues.)
For a discussion of the many different types of real estate, how they may be 
owned, and how that can impact your estate plan, see Chapter 17.
Personal property
What other assets are in your estate? Everything in your house, for starters. 
Do you have a storage unit? A safe deposit box? What’s inside? Most likely 
you own some or all of the following:
 
 Home furnishings
 
 Jewelry
 
 Collectibles
 
 Art

43
 Chapter 3: Gathering Pertinent Information
 
 Antiques
 
 Clothing and personal effects
Those items are all forms of tangible personal property, items you can touch 
and feel. You may also own intangible property, including stocks, bonds, 
investment accounts, and intellectual property, such as copyrights and pat-
ents. Investments are addressed more specifically later in this section.
As you inventory your personal property, your belongings break down into 
three general categories:
 
 Items with appreciable market value
 
 Items with little market value but high sentimental value
 
 Items of little value
 
You probably already know what I’m going to say, but don’t underestimate 
sentimental value when allocating items of property between your heirs. 
Consider how to keep family heirlooms and other treasures within the family 
and how to divide them equitably between your heirs. One common approach 
is to make specific bequests to your heirs for your more cherished belong-
ings and then having your heirs take turns choosing items that they want until 
your personal belongings have been fully distributed.
Titled personal property
Titled personal property includes cars, boats, manufactured homes, and any 
other item of personal property where ownership is conveyed by a title 
instrument. For each item of property, consider how it’s owned and the 
amount of any outstanding loans.
If you’re married, some or all of your titled property may be jointly owned. If 
it isn’t and you want your spouse to receive the property upon your death, 
rather than conveying it by will or trust, you can usually add your spouse as 
a co-owner before your death.
For heirs other than your spouse, I suggest sticking with your will or trust. Your 
conveyance may trigger sales taxes. Also, adding somebody outside of your 
household as a co-owner of your boat or car creates a risk to you. Do you want 
that person to have the legal right to drive away in your car, keeping or returning 
it at his own convenience? If you add a co-owner to your title, he will have this 
right.
 
If you have an outstanding loan against the property, adding a co-owner will 
normally require the consent of the lienholder.

Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Savings
Your savings include your cash, savings accounts, checking accounts, money 
market accounts, CDs, and other liquid assets. Don’t underestimate the value 
of your savings to your estate plan.
 
 Your estate will have bills to pay, including any unpaid credit-card 
debts, mortgages and car loans, medical bills, funeral expenses, and the 
costs of estate administration,
 
 If your savings aren’t sufficient to cover your outstanding bills and the 
expenses of your estate, other assets will be sold to pay those expenses.
Are you short on cash? You can help plan for a cash crunch by describing 
in your will which assets are to be sold to pay off those debts. You can also 
obtain a modest life insurance policy that will provide your estate with addi-
tional liquidity.
Investments
Your investments include your stocks, bonds, mutual funds, brokerage accounts, 
and stock options. If your estate requires money to pay its bills or to cover the 
costs of administration, often these will be the first items of property you want to 
liquidate. Make note of each investment, where it’s held, and its value.
You may be able to add a beneficiary to your investment accounts. You may 
also opt to add somebody as a joint owner of certain of your investments, 
granting her a right of survivorship. You can utilize your investments as part 
of a gifting strategy, giving stock shares to your heirs each year to reduce the 
size of your taxable estate.
Do you own a small business, or own shares in a small business? You should 
be thinking about a business succession plan. See Chapter 4 for advice and 
ideas.
Insurance policies and annuities
If you own life insurance policies or annuities, for each policy you need to 
take note of the following:
 
 The type of policy
 
 The owner
 
 The beneficiaries
 
 The death benefit

45
 Chapter 3: Gathering Pertinent Information
 
 The surrender value
 
 The balance of any outstanding loan
 
 The premium
You may be able to avoid estate taxes by transferring ownership of a life 
insurance policy to somebody else or into a trust. For more information 
about estate planning with life insurance, see Chapter 16.
Retirement savings
Retirement savings accounts can take many forms, including 401(k) plans, 
403(b) plans, qualified stock bonus plans, profit-sharing plans, regular IRAs, 
Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, and tax-sheltered annuities.
Normally, you’ll designate beneficiaries for your retirement accounts. Your 
account will pass to your designated beneficiary without going through pro-
bate. If you’re married, you will probably name your spouse as the primary 
beneficiary, and perhaps name your children as contingent beneficiaries.
For more information on how your retirement savings figure into your estate 
plan, see Chapter 15.
Pensions
If you’re receiving pension benefits or will receive a pension upon retire-
ment, your plan will define what benefit your spouse will receive after your 
death. You may be able to change the survivor’s benefits for your pension by 
increasing or decreasing your contribution.
If your pension plan doesn’t have survivor’s benefits, consider how the loss 
of income is going to affect your spouse upon your death. Similarly, if you will 
be the spouse who is left out in the cold, how will you support yourself? You 
may want to consider investing in life insurance.
Considering Community and 
Jointly Owned Property
Where you own property may affect your estate plan. If you do nothing, your 
estate will have to commence ancillary proceedings, a fancy term for additional 
probate proceedings, in the states where your property is located. Those pro-
ceedings will cost money and will almost always cause delay.

46
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
You can minimize those issues by transferring ownership of those properties 
to a living trust during your lifetime, although you must weigh the benefits of 
simplified probate against transfer taxes and possible tax reassessments trig-
gered by the transfer of title.
If you’re married and have lived in a community property state for any 
amount of time during your marriage or own real estate in a community 
property state, then you probably own community property. Community 
property is property that you acquire during your marriage or that you buy 
with money earned during your marriage, including interest earned on invest-
ments made before your marriage. However, even in community property 
states, gifts and inheritances received by one spouse are regarded as sepa-
rate property. Whenever you move to or from a community property state, 
you should review your estate plan.
Community property laws exist in Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, New 
Mexico, Nevada, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington State, and Wisconsin.
Under community property laws, you have the right to decide who inherits 
your separate property and half of your community property. If you leave 
community property to your spouse, your spouse enjoys a stepped-up basis in 
your share of the asset, meaning that the difference between the amount you 
paid for your share and its value at the time of your death is erased for tax 
purposes. This stepped-up basis reduces the amount of capital gains tax that 
may be owed if your spouse sells the property. For example, if you paid $60 
for a home that is now worth $300,000, your spouse avoids capital gains taxes 
on a $240,000 gain — a substantial savings. However, your spouse doesn’t 
receive a step up in basis for other jointly owned property.
If you move out of a community property state, most states have statutes 
that will continue to apply community property laws to the disposition of 
your community property. But if you sell community property while living in 
your new state, the asset you purchase with the proceeds of the sale will no 
longer be community property.
Keeping track of separate property and community property can become 
very difficult. If you commingle your money, combining separate assets with 
community assets, it can become impossible to determine where your sepa-
rate property ends and community property begins. The longer your mar-
riage, the more difficult the task.
If you reside in a community property state, live in a community property 
state during part of your marriage, or own real estate in a community prop-
erty state, you need to understand how community property laws affect your 
estate plan. If you and your spouse are comfortable talking about financial 
issues, you can sit down and agree what portions of your estate are commu-
nity property and what are separate property.

47
 Chapter 3: Gathering Pertinent Information
You may enter into a prenuptial agreement with your spouse, modifying how 
community property laws apply to assets you acquire during your marriage.
 
You can help avoid having to revise your living trust by including a choice 
of law clause, stating that the trust is governed by the laws of the state in 
which it was executed. In some cases, you can even choose to have your trust 
governed by a different state’s laws. That way, even if you move, your trust 
should continue to be interpreted in the manner you intend.
Jointly owned property is another ball game. When you own property with 
others, one of two things may happen:
 
 The other person may have a right of survivorship, automatically inherit-
ing your share of the property when you die.
 
 They have no right of survivorship, and you may leave your share to the 
heirs of your choice.
You don’t need to include provisions in your estate plan for property where 
your co-owner has a right of survivorship. However, you do need to provide 
for other jointly owned property.
 
Consider how your bequests will affect your joint owners. Think about how 
you would you feel if your co-owner left her interest to somebody without 
considering the impact on you. Consider, for example, a rental house that you 
jointly own with your sister. You may want to negotiate a buy-sell agreement 
that allows either of you to purchase the other’s share from her estate. That’s 
usually far better than a bequest that translates into, “Surprise! You have a 
new business partner!”
If you own shares of a small business, you may be restricted in your abil-
ity to give, sell, or bequeath your shares to others. Your business partners 
may also have the right to purchase the shares upon your death. You should 
review the terms of your stock ownership, any buy-sell agreements, or other 
succession plan that your business has put into effect. If your business 
doesn’t have a succession plan, sit down with your partners and create one.
Valuing Your Property
When you die, your assets are valued at their fair market value, the price 
you would expect to pay for a comparable item on the open market. Your 
personal representative or trustee oversees the appraisal process. In most 
cases, your estate is valued as of your date of death. However, if your estate 
decreases in value, your estate may seek to use an alternate valuation date of 
six months after your date of death.

48
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
For cash assets, investment accounts, and retirement savings, determin-
ing fair market value may be as simple as obtaining a bank statement or an 
account balance from a financial institution. As their historic values are a 
matter of record, your personal representative can obtain actual market 
values for stocks, bonds, and other investments as of the valuation date.
Other assets, such as real estate, fine art, collections, and antiquities, will 
need to be appraised. Your estate may also need to have an appraisal of your 
household items and personal effects, although often an estimate will suffice. 
Your estate will pay the cost of any appraisals.
After values are determined for all your assets, your executor or personal 
rep uses those numbers to prepare an accounting for the probate court and 
a tax return for your estate. Your estate’s liability for gift and estate taxes is 
determined from the total value of your estate. Your heirs benefit from a step 
up in basis for their inheritances. (For more on this topic, see the section 
“Considering Community and Jointly Owned Property,” earlier in this chap-
ter.) Unless new legislation passes by the end of 2009, the estate tax will be 
entirely repealed in 2010. During that year, there will be no step up in basis 
on inheritances. While the estate tax repeal works primarily to the benefit 
of large estates, stepped-up basis can benefit almost anyone. The estate tax 
repeal expires at the end of 2010, so unless new legislation passes, the estate 
tax will return with a vengeance on New Year’s Day 2011, as will stepped-up 
basis for inherited property.
 
If you expect that your estate will owe estate taxes, you can utilize a gifting 
strategy or other estate tax-planning techniques to transfer the value of your 
assets during your lifetime. If you give your assets away before they appreci-
ate, your estate tax obligations are determined by their value at the time of 
your gift as opposed to the time of your death. You can also employ estate 
planning tools that may give your heirs a discount against market value, 
again potentially saving estate taxes. Although your heirs may eventually face 
greater capital gains tax liability, capital gains taxes are substantially lower 
than estate taxes. For more on estate tax planning, see Chapter 6.

G
   iving away your assets is easy, right? You just make a list of the people 
in your life who are closest to you, divide your assets between them, 
and you’re done. Well, maybe not. You have to consider many other factors 
in order to be sure that your estate plan is carried out as you intend and that 
your beneficiaries receive the full benefit of your gifts.
This chapter helps you identify the people, institutions, charities, and other 
beneficiaries to whom you wish to leave bequests. It also helps you recognize 
special circumstances that may affect your estate plan, such as the effect 
of blended marriages and business succession planning. You also discover 
how to select a trustee or personal representative, when you should get help 
from an estate planning professional, and how to find and choose a lawyer, 
accountant, or institutional trustee.
Calculating Your Assets
In creating your estate plan, you need to figure out what assets you have and 
how you wish to leave them to your heirs. You inventory your various assets, 
including your savings, investments, retirement accounts, real estate, per-
sonal property, cars, boats, jewelry, collections, and anything else you own. 
You consider your debts, including asset-related debts, such as mortgages 
and car loans. You also consider how your property is held and whether 
jointly held property will pass to the joint title holder without going through 
probate. (Joint ownership of property is discussed in Chapter 3, and the 
common forms of joint ownership of real estate are discussed in Chapter 17.)

50
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
For the most part, your estate plan is written on paper and isn’t locked in 
stone. You may change your will or revocable trusts at any time you choose. 
Similarly, you may change the beneficiaries on your life insurance policies, 
annuities, and retirement accounts. If you use irrevocable trusts in your 
estate plan, once you transfer assets into those trusts, you can’t change your 
mind about your gifts.
 
The CD contains a form to help you keep track of your assets and plan your 
bequests. For your easy reference it is also available in Appendix C.
Determining Your Intended 
Heirs and Beneficiaries
After you create a list of assets and heirs, you can decide how to divide those 
assets. Consider your family, including your parents, spouse, children, grand-
children, siblings, and perhaps also aunts and uncles, cousins, nieces and 
nephews, or more distant relatives. Think about whether you want to make 
gifts to friends or other nonrelatives. You may also decide to leave bequests 
to charities, schools, churches, or other organizations.
Even with this list in hand, you’re not quite done. You need to think about 
how your heirs may change over time, through birth, death, adoption, 
divorce, remarriage, or anything else that may happen in the future. You 
don’t have to write your estate plan to cover every contingency, but your 
forethought can help you create an estate plan that needs less frequent 
amendment. You will also have a better picture of what types of changes in 
your life will necessitate the revision of your estate plan.
 
Your estate will have bills and expenses of its own and has to repay your out-
standing debts. Your trust will also incur expenses. Make sure that you pro-
vide sufficient money for those expenses, or your gifts to your heirs may have 
be reduced in amount or sold so that your estate can pay those expenses.
 
You should include a clause in your will or trust distributing the residuary — 
anything that is left over after all specific gifts and bequests have been made. 
This clause will ensure that any gifts or bequests that are declined by an heir 
or that lapse due to the death of an heir, are properly distributed. It will also 
prevent the need to have a court distribute what may be a small amount of 
money or an asset with limited value, with court costs and legal fees poten-
tially exceeding that value.

51
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Bequests
Individuals
After you figure out who your heirs are, you need to figure what you want to 
leave to them.
 
 How much do you want to leave to each heir?
 
 Do you want your heirs to inherit equally?
 
 Do you want your heirs to inherit immediately upon your death, or do 
you want to defer part or all of their inheritance to a later date?
 
 Do you want to make any bequests conditional, such as requiring a child 
to marry or graduate from college before they inherit?
 
 Do you want to disinherit any heirs so that they receive nothing under 
your will or trust?
 
 What do you want to happen to your bequest if your heir dies before 
you or declines to accept it?
If you intend to leave specific assets to your heirs, you need to remember that 
the value of your assets may change over time. In some cases, the asset may 
be sold, lost, or destroyed before your will or trust is administered. You may 
include language in your trust that equalizes the value of specific gifts, such 
that a child receiving a less valuable gift will also receive a sum of cash. You 
can also give heirs a percentage of your estate instead of specific dollar values 
to help preserve your intentions in the event that your estate grows or shrinks 
in size. For more discussion of these gifting techniques, see Chapter 8.
If you want to keep an asset in the family, you should designate an alternate 
beneficiary just in case your primary beneficiary dies. For example, if you 
leave your daughter your grandmother’s engagement ring, do you want it to 
go to your son-in-law if she dies before you? Or would you prefer that it go to 
another child or to one of your grandchildren?
You may leave your household furnishings or other personal property to your 
heir without making an exhaustive list of everything you own. For example, 
you can leave your clothes to a specific heir or charity. Another option is to 
describe a mechanism by which your heirs will inherit personal property — 
for example, you could leave your children your furniture, but provide that 
they take turns selecting a piece of furniture until all of it has been distrib-
uted between them. If you provide for them to take turns selecting items, you 
should also either indicate who picks first or describe a technique, such as 
drawing a high card from a deck of cards, to determine who will be randomly 
selected to pick first.

52
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
To make sure that some heirs benefit from your request, you must engage in 
some extra estate planning. For example, your minor children will require some-
body to manage their assets. One of your children may be bad with money, so 
you may want to create a spendthrift trust to prevent them from squandering an 
inheritance or having it taken by creditors. If you have a child or grandchild with 
special needs, you may need to create a special needs trust to allow him to ben-
efit from your gift instead of the state taking it as reimbursement for the cost of 
public assistance. These trusts are discussed in Chapter 12.
You’re not limited to describing your heirs by name. You may also describe 
your heirs by class, such as “to my children” or “to my grandchildren.” Such 
language may help ensure that children or grandchildren born after you 
complete your estate plan share in an inheritance. Or, if you prefer, you can 
expressly exclude after-born children. You may also state whether or not you 
want adopted children or stepchildren to be treated as your children or pro-
vide for them separately.
 
State law restricts your ability to disinherit your spouse and may also restrict 
your ability to disinherit your minor children. You should expect that under 
state law, your spouse will have the legal right to an elective share of your 
estate , possibly including assets held by your living trust. If you leave your 
spouse less than that amount, your spouse can choose to take the elective 
share instead of your bequest. The consequence can significantly alter the dis-
tribution of your estate to your other heirs.
Disinheriting heirs through a trust is easier than disinheriting them through 
your will. If you want to disinherit a legal heir or want more information 
about state law restrictions on your bequests, read the discussion of those 
issues in Chapter 8.
 
Louisiana has an unusual set of laws described as forced heirship laws, which 
attempt to force you to leave certain minimum bequests to your spouse and 
children. Louisiana also limits the circumstances under which you can avoid the 
application of those laws. These laws can make it difficult to plan even a simple 
estate in Louisiana, unless your wishes happen to accidentally correlate with 
what state law requires. Although most people will benefit from discussing these 
laws with a lawyer, you can find a summary of Louisiana’s forced heirship laws 
on the Web site of the law firm of Baldwin and Haspel (www.bhbmlaw.com). 
Click Publications and then choose the article Louisiana Forced Heirship.
Institutions or charities
You may want to leave part or all of your estate to an organization that 
advances the public good or supports a cause you believe in. Subject to state 
law restrictions on disinheriting your heirs, discussed in the preceding sec-
tion of this chapter, you are free to do so. Many charities and educational 
institutions offer model documents you can use to leave bequests to them.

53
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Bequests
Charitable giving may also help you avoid estate taxes. A bequest to a tax-
exempt organization may provide your estate with a tax deduction.
You may also consider using a charitable remainder trust to reduce the size 
of your taxable estate or to help you avoid capital gains taxes. Typically, the 
trust is set up to provide an income for yourself while eventually making a 
gift to charity. The trust may also be reversed, providing an income to a char-
ity from an asset that will pass to your heirs upon your death. Chapter 6 dis-
cusses charitable remainder trusts.
Other bequests
It’s your money, so for the most part, you can leave it to whomever you want. 
You can set up scholarships or memorial funds, support a public garden, or 
engage in other creative gifting.
You can also create a trust to benefit your pet. Pet trusts are not universally 
recognized as valid, although a growing number of states have passed laws 
making them enforceable. In states where they’re not formally recognized, try 
to choose a trustee who will carry out your wishes even though they’re not 
legally binding. Chapter 12 discusses pet trusts in detail.
Thinking about Your Family 
Circumstances
Generally speaking, the complexity of your estate plan increases with the size 
of your family. It’s pretty easy to plan your estate when you’re single. Getting 
married doesn’t add much complication. But then you have kids, divorce, 
remarry, have a blended family. . . . Each new development may complicate 
your plans and wishes.
If you’re in a domestic partnership, the odds are your state provides no inheri-
tance rights to your partner if you die. Consistent with your wishes, you must 
create an estate plan that conveys assets to your partner and grants your part-
ner authority over your estate and person in the event of incapacity. Chapter 17 
discusses real estate issues affecting domestic partners.
 
Whenever your family circumstances change, whether by birth, death, adop-
tion, marriage, separation, divorce, remarriage, or anything else you can think 
of, you need to review your estate plan to make sure that it remains consistent 
with your wishes and goals.

54
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Estate Planning for Second Families
If neither you nor your spouse have children, estate planning for your second 
marriage is pretty simple. You simply execute new estate planning docu-
ments designating your spouse as your beneficiary. In some cases, you may 
want a more complicated estate plan, leaving some of your premarital assets 
to other friends, relatives, or charities instead of your spouse.
But if you or your spouse have children from prior relationships, things 
become a lot more complicated. And the complications compound if you 
later have children together. Here are some questions to think about:
 
 Do you wish to treat all your children equally? Including your stepchil-
dren? Including minor children, who must be supported during their 
childhood and who may need assistance with college costs?
 
 Does your spouse want to treat your children equally with his own 
children?
 
 Is your spouse younger than you? If you leave your estate to your 
spouse “for life,” how will your spouse’s age affect when your children 
receive their inheritances?
 
 If your spouse survives you, will your spouse’s estate plan include all 
your children, or will your children from your prior relationship be 
effectively disinherited?
You may feel 100 percent certain that your spouse “will take care of” your 
children and be comfortable leaving your entire estate to your spouse. Most 
of the time, your instincts will be correct, and your spouse will respect your 
wishes. But if your spouse chooses not to leave money to your children from 
the prior marriage or dies intestate, your children are effectively disinherited.
Start thinking about estate planning before you marry. You may find that you 
need a prenuptial agreement in order to keep some of your premarital assets 
from becoming part of your marital estate or subject to your spouse’s elec-
tive share of your estate. The elective share is the amount your spouse may 
choose to inherit under state law, and your spouse may exercise that right if 
your will provides for a lesser inheritance.
Giving your new spouse a life estate
A common tool used in estate planning for second marriages is the life 
estate. If you own your marital home as separate property, you can make 
your spouse a life tenant. Your children receive title to the home upon your 
spouse’s death. But a life estate may prove to be an imperfect tool:

55
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Bequests
 
 If your spouse is younger than you, your children may be elderly by the 
time they inherit your home. As your home is usually the most valuable 
asset in your estate, this delay can mean that they inherit little or nothing 
during the years when an inheritance would be most useful to them.
 
 A life estate can put your spouse in conflict with your children. Your 
children may believe that your spouse is neglecting the property. At 
times this is true, with your spouse failing to pay taxes or the principal 
portion of the mortgage, or failing to fix a leaky roof or other structural 
problem, putting your children’s inheritance at risk.
 
 A life estate may not be consistent with your own wishes. For example, 
you may prefer that your home go to your children after your spouse 
remarries.
 
Even without a prenuptial agreement, you can help mitigate these issues.
 
 If you can afford to do so, you can purchase life insurance for the ben-
efit of your children. Although their inheritance of your house is delayed, 
they immediately get the proceeds of your insurance when you die.
 
 You can hold the house in trust and provide for your spouse to reside 
in the house for a fixed number of years, perhaps five or ten years. 
After that period of time expires, the house is conveyed to your children.
Using trusts to hold your assets
Your living trust can be beneficial in directing your separate property to your 
children. You can also place some of your assets in an irrevocable trust for 
the benefit of your children before you remarry, but you need to be aware of 
gift tax consequences. (Gift and estate taxes are discussed in Chapter 6.)
A common estate planning tool for second marriages is the bypass trust, 
in which you leave a substantial bequest to your children. This gift takes 
advantage of your gift tax exemption, by keeping the gift out of your spouse’s 
taxable estate. It also permits you to provide income for the support of your 
spouse, while directing the principal of the trust to your children.
Another common estate planning tool for second marriages is the Qualified 
Terminable Interest Property (QTIP) trust, which is often used in conjunction 
with a bypass trust. You can use the bypass trust up to the amount of your 
estate tax exemption and then use a QTIP trust for other assets, which will 
be treated as part of your spouse’s estate, but which you may still direct to 
your children upon your spouse’s death. These trusts are discussed in detail 
in Chapter 12.

56
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
More tools to consider
Some states permit contract wills, which can’t be changed after the death of 
the first spouse. However, this type of will can be unduly limiting, particularly 
if the surviving spouse remarries or has more children, and may complicate 
probate. Before considering a contract will, be sure you fully understand how 
the joint estate plan would affect you as the surviving spouse.
A more complicated estate planning tool that may be useful in second mar-
riages is the Family Limited Partnership (FLP). You control the assets in your 
FLP, while your children are limited partners who have an ownership share 
but no control over the assets. The FLP is often costly to create and compara-
tively burdensome to maintain. Chapter 6 discusses FLPs in more detail.
 
Don’t forget to update the beneficiary designation for your insurance policies 
and retirement accounts. If you don’t, you may find that you leave a windfall 
to your ex-spouse instead of your current spouse and children.
Prenuptial agreements
As you enter your second marriage, you may want 
a prenuptial agreement, but be afraid of how your 
prospective spouse will react to the idea. Another 
common concern involves the full disclosure of 
your assets to your spouse. You may not want 
to make that type of disclosure. Yet a prenuptial 
agreement may provide significant estate plan-
ning advantages. You can help mitigate worries 
by keeping the agreement simple or, particularly 
if your primary interest is in your estate plan, by 
including provisions that will provide generously 
for your spouse in the event of divorce.
Your prenuptial agreement will clarify what prop-
erty, which of your assets, and which of your 
spouse’s assets continue to be separate property 
after you marry, including your interest in a family 
business. Your prenuptial agreement can waive 
the rights that you and your spouse have to take 
an elective share of each other’s estates. It will 
also provide for how property will be divided if 
you divorce and may limit spousal support.
Even without a prenuptial agreement, if you’re 
careful with your assets, you should be able 
to keep many of your premarital assets out of 
your marital estate. This separation is more dif-
ficult in community property estates, or if you 
use marital assets to make loan payments or to 
maintain or improve the premarital asset. Also, 
simply keeping your assets separate will not be 
sufficient to protect those assets from being 
included in your spouse’s “elective share” of 
your estate. Still, if you leave your spouse a 
greater inheritance than state law requires, 
it’s very unlikely that your spouse will instead 
choose to receive the elective share.
If you decide to use a prenuptial agreement, 
make sure that you introduce the idea well in 
advance of your marriage ceremony — at least 
several weeks in advance and preferably sev-
eral months. You and your spouse should both 
have independent legal representation to help 
you understand the agreement. If you have 
significantly more money than your prospec-
tive spouse, you can pay his lawyer fee, but he 
should pick his own lawyer.

 Chapter 4: Planning Your Bequests
Estate Planning for Your Business
If you own your own business or a share of a family business, your estate 
plan should include a business succession plan. A will isn’t enough, and your 
living trust is probably inadequate. Business succession is a complicated 
process and is usually best implemented over a course of years. If you’re a 
business owner:
 
 If you’re active in your business, your succession plan should provide for 
the continued operation of the business in case of your incapacity or death.
 
 Your succession plan should describe who will own your interest after 
your death, and who will take over your management role.
 
 You may also carry life insurance to help fund the continued operation 
of the business; to hire additional staff to perform the tasks you previ-
ously performed; or to provide a cushion for liability the business may 
incur as a result of interruptions in its services.
 
 Your succession plan should be flexible enough that it can be adapted to 
the changing needs of your business, as well as changes in your wishes 
and those of your heirs.
 
You need to be aware of possible estate tax consequences of business owner-
ship. Your estate plan should anticipate the possibility that your business 
could fail upon your death, but that when calculating your estate taxes the IRS 
may try to value your business as if it continues to operate. As part of your 
estate plan, you should document the factors that may limit the value of your 
business to a buyer or that may make it difficult to sell. That documentation 
will make it easier for your family to argue that, upon your death, the business 
had little or no value.
 
Many small businesses falter or fail when their founder leaves the business 
or dies. Sometimes this failure is unavoidable, particularly if the business is 
entirely dependent upon the owner. The nature of the business may make 
its value largely dependent upon the continued involvement of the owner, as 
with a law practice or dentist’s office, or the owner may operate the business 
in a manner that leaves it with little value to a buyer, such as by choosing to 
maximize short-term income and not investing profits back into the business. 
A good succession plan can help ensure that your business continues to func-
tion after your death.
Sometimes you will want to transfer business ownership or management to 
another family member, perhaps a child. Other times, you will want to sell 
the business to somebody outside of your family. Remember that it can take 
a long time to find a buyer for your business, and the buyer may expect train-
ing and support. If you intend for your business to be sold after your death, 
you should still implement a plan for its operation and management pending 
sale and for support of the new owner.

Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Inheritance of your sole proprietorship
When you’re the sole owner of your business and you want to leave it to your 
heirs, you need to consider many factors:
 
 Who will manage your business? If one of your children is already 
managing your business, it’s easy enough to have your child continue in 
that role. But if not, are any of your heirs both willing and able to take 
over the business? If it’s necessary to hire a manager, who will make the 
hiring decision and how will the position be funded? How quickly can 
the new manager take over, so as to minimize or eliminate any interrup-
tion in operations.
 
 Will your death cause an interruption in the cash flow of your busi-
ness? If so, you may want to purchase insurance to help your business 
maintain its liquidity.
 
 Who will inherit ownership? Will you give the business to one of your 
children, balanced against bequests of other assets or life insurance 
proceeds to your other children? If you give equal ownership interests 
to your children, will you also give them equal say in the operation of 
the business? If so, by what mechanism will disputes between them be 
resolved?
Discussing your succession plan
You may have a very clear idea of who will take 
over your business when you die, and how your 
heirs will share ownership or management 
responsibility. But you need to talk to your heirs 
about your plans and make sure that you’re on 
the same page. A poor choice of manager, or 
conflicts between comanagers, create a sub-
stantial possibility that your business to fail.
You may discover that the child who manages 
your business is losing interest in the business 
and intends to sell the business upon your death. 
If your child manager has grown your business, 
your child may resent the idea that ownership 
will be shared equally with her other siblings 
upon your death. Some children will threaten to 
quit if they feel that their hard work will end up 
creating a windfall for siblings who have their 
own lives and careers apart from the business.
You may be inclined to leave your children 
equal ownership and management roles in 
your business. Conflicts often arise between 
co-owners. For example, your children have 
different visions of how the business should 
operate, or one wants to invest profits in the 
business while the other wants to withdraw the 
maximum salary and dividends. Your conversa-
tion with your heirs will help you anticipate and 
plan for this type of conflict.

59
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Bequests
The FLP (see Chapter 6) may be a useful tool in leaving your business to your 
heirs, while also possibly reducing its value for the calculation of estate tax. 
In an FLP, you retain control of your business as the managing partner, while 
transferring ownership of shares to your children. Your children are limited 
partners and thus do not have any say in your management decisions. You 
can use the annual gift tax exemption, presently $12,000, to gradually transfer 
ownership to your children while reducing your taxable estate.
Even if you choose not to implement a FLP, perhaps due to its cost or com-
plexity, you may nonetheless use an annual gifting strategy to transfer shares 
of your business to your children. Annual gifts have an additional benefit, in 
that as your business grows in value so do the shares you have already trans-
ferred. If you wait until you die, today’s $12,000 gift may represent a six-figure 
increase in your taxable estate. Although your children will face increased 
capital gains tax if they sell the gifted shares, as opposed to getting a step up 
in basis when inheriting them at your death, the potential tax savings remain 
substantial. For more on estate taxes, and my skepticism that that repeal will 
become permanent, see Chapter 6.
You can also sell shares to your children during your lifetime, financing 
the sale with a low-interest promissory note. Similar to a gift, your children 
receive the shares at a much lower value than they’re likely to be worth at 
the time of your death. You may still implement a gifting strategy, using your 
annual gift tax exclusion to forgive part of the debt owed on the note.
Inheritance of your share of a business
Every small business with more than one owner should have a buy-sell agree-
ment addressing the right to purchase shares from a partner who wants to 
leave the business, or from a partner who becomes incapacitated or dies. 
You probably don’t want a stranger buying or inheriting your partner’s inter-
est, or exercising the proxy rights of an incapacitated partner and then trying 
to assert a say in how your business is operated. Without a buy-sell agree-
ment, you may get exactly that or may give that “gift” to your partners.
If you own a share of a business, whether it’s a family business or a business 
you run with partners or investors, you face many of the same issues as with 
a sole proprietorship (see preceding section). If you manage the business or 
have a significant management role, you and your partners need to plan for a 
successor manager.

60
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
A key difference is that your partners have an interest in how your shares are 
distributed. Some businesses have buy-sell agreements, detailing how shares 
are to be valued and when your shares may be purchased by the other part-
ners. Depending upon what you and your partners decide,
 
 The business may buy life insurance to help fund the purchase of a 
deceased partner’s shares.
 
 The buy-sell agreement may provide for your partners to pay for your 
shares in installments.
 
 Your partners can purchase your shares for cash, obtaining financing, if 
necessary.
The buy-sell agreement may be triggered upon a partner’s death or incapac-
ity, giving your partners the opportunity to purchase your shares from your 
estate rather than having them inherited by somebody they would prefer not 
be involved in the business. You, of course, get the same benefit should mis-
fortune fall upon one of your partners.
Appointing the People Who Will 
Carry Out Your Estate Plans
You may be used to taking charge of every detail of your life. But no matter 
how independent you are, you can’t administer your own estate. You have to 
get help from somebody else. So what do you do?
You seek out helpers who are trustworthy, responsible, and financially 
stable, and who are young and healthy enough that they’re likely to remain 
both willing and able to manage your affairs after your death or incapacity. 
Your choice will usually be a person, but at times you may choose an insti-
tutional trustee or lawyer to administer your trust or will. The following sec-
tions help you make the right choices and choose helpers who will protect 
your estate and respect your wishes.
Choosing your personal representative 
or trustee
Your personal representative, also called an executor, is the person who man-
ages your estate during the probate process. Your trustee manages the assets 
held by your trust. During the administration of your trust or estate, your 
trustee and personal representatives will be the primary target of anybody 
who is unhappy with your estate plan or the way it is being administered.

61
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Bequests
Whenever you choose somebody to assist with your estate plan, you should 
talk to them before adding them to your will or trust. This discussion isn’t 
a sales pitch where you’re trying to convince somebody to become your 
trustee. It’s more like a job interview, where you try to be absolutely certain 
that your candidate is trustworthy, reliable, and willing to perform a difficult 
job. Find out the answers to the following questions:
 
 Do they want the job?
 
 Do they truly understand how difficult it may be?
 
 Do they have the necessary knowledge and skills to fulfill their role?
 
 Do they have the time to perform their role?
 
 Do they live near you? If not, how much travel will be involved if they 
accept the job?
 
 Are they comfortable interpreting your will or trust?
 
 Are they financially stable? Will they have any temptation to “borrow” 
money they’re supposed to safeguard?
 
 Do they expect to be compensated? If so, and you wish them to agree to 
a particular rate or amount of compensation, is the compensation you’re 
offering acceptable?
 
 Do they understand your goals and wishes?
 
 Will they stand up for your wishes, even if friends and relatives are 
pressing them to make a different decision?
 
Estate administration involves number crunching. Accountings must be pre-
pared for a probate court, and possibly for trust beneficiaries. There may be 
a lot of bills to pay and savings, retirement, and investment accounts to close 
out. Tax returns must be filed on behalf of your trust and estate. Your trustee 
may also be responsible for managing or leasing property and making invest-
ment decisions. Either your trustee or personal representative may have to 
liquidate estate assets — for example, to pay taxes owed by your estate.
While it’s reasonable for your trustee or personal representative to hire pro-
fessionals to assist with these tasks, you need to choose somebody who is 
comfortable working with numbers. Their math skills increase the quality of 
oversight of your assets and reduce the chance that your estate will unneces-
sarily incur expenses for professional services.
 
If your personal representative or trustee will take control of your business, 
be sure that she’s competent to manage your business affairs. Remember the 
recommendations for business succession planning, discussed earlier in this 
chapter in the section on “Estate Planning for Your Business.” Don’t let your 
business falter or fail due to a lack of preparation for your death or incapacity.
Chapter 11 details other tips for choosing a trustee, including an institutional 
trustee.

62
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
 
One factor you may have in mind when choosing a trustee or personal repre-
sentative is whether she’ll work for free. That expectation may be reasonable 
if your trustee or personal representative is a primary beneficiary of your 
estate or if your estate is simple. But working for free is otherwise a lot to ask 
of somebody. For a larger or more complicated estate, either task can become 
a part-time job, and in some cases, a full-time job. Compensation makes it 
much less likely that your trustee or personal representative will resent the 
job or will resign when they realize just how much work is involved.
Choosing a successor
It takes two, baby. Or more. Your first choice as personal representative or 
trustee may not be able to fulfill that role for many reasons:
 
 Your first choice may become ill or die.
 
 Completing the tasks involved may take more time and effort than your 
first choice is willing or able to give.
Should you choose copersonal representatives 
or cotrustees?
Sometimes you may have more than one person 
in mind to help with the administration of your 
estate. For example, one person may be very 
good with numbers, but not have much time to 
devote to estate administration, while another 
may have ample time but be terrified of prepar-
ing accountings or tax returns. Perhaps you 
have two children and fear that one will resent 
the other if you designate one but not the other. 
A possible resolution is to appoint them as joint 
administrators of your estate.
There’s no limit on how many people can jointly 
administer your estate, although at a certain 
point, a saying comes to mind: “Too many cooks 
spoil the broth.” Don’t unnecessarily compli-
cate the administration of your will or trust by 
appointing a panel of administrators. Also, as 
hard as it is to find a trustee or personal repre-
sentative who is both qualified and willing, the 
more people you add, the more likely it is that 
you will end up including somebody who is not 
an appropriate choice.
The biggest concern in appointing more than 
one person as trustee or personal represen-
tative is that conflict will occur. Even if you’re 
sure that your choices will get along, include a 
mechanism for dispute resolution. Your dispute 
resolution mechanism may involve assigning 
tie-breaking authority to one person, providing 
for mediation or arbitration, or even tossing a 
coin or drawing the high card from a deck of 
cards.

63
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Bequests
 
 Despite your prior discussions, your first choice may simply change his 
mind and decline the appointment.
 
 Your first choice may not be sufficiently competent or capable and may 
have to be replaced by a court.
By designating a successor (or more than one successor), your trust or 
estate will continue to be managed by somebody you choose.
 
If the person you chose as trustee or personal representative becomes unwill-
ing or unable to serve, unless you have designated a successor, the probate 
court will choose somebody to take over the job. The person appointed may 
be a complete stranger who has no familiarity with your goals and wishes and 
will charge fees that may significantly exceed what a friend or relative would 
agree to accept.
Discussing your estate plan 
with your helpers
After you have chosen your trustee, personal representative, and succes-
sors, you need to make sure that she understands your wishes. You should 
sit down with her, whether alone or together, and have a conversation about 
your estate plan and goals.
Go over your will or trust and explain what each provision means. Encourage 
your helper to ask questions.
Finding Professionals to Assist You
The more complicated your estate plan, the more likely it is that you will 
require assistance when preparing and implementing your plan. Common 
situations in which professional assistance is recommended include
 
 You’re planning for business succession.
 
 You’re using estate tax avoidance strategies.
 
 You’re doing estate planning for second marriages
 
 You’re leaving assets to a disabled heir who receives public assistance
 
 You’re disinheriting an heir.

64
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
 
If you’re doing anything unconventional with your assets within the state of 
Louisiana, you can easily run afoul of that state’s forced heirship laws. You 
should consult a lawyer to make sure that your estate plan is properly formu-
lated and that it will be upheld by a court.
Getting help from a lawyer
Your first task in getting help from a lawyer is finding a responsible estate 
planning lawyer. Your ideal lawyer will be experienced not only with planning 
estates, but with planning estates that are similar to yours. Similarity goes 
beyond size and extends to similarity of assets. If you have a small business, 
you need a lawyer familiar with business succession issues. If you’re on your 
second marriage, need to create a special needs trust for a disabled child, 
or want to disinherit an heir, seek a lawyer who is experienced with those 
issues. You may want a lawyer who has probate experience and whose estate 
planning documents have stood up in probate court.
Easier said than done? Certainly. You won’t find that type of detail from a 
Yellow Pages ad, and if you call a law office and ask, you’re almost certain to 
hear that the lawyer you have contacted has qualifications that far exceed 
your needs (whether or not that is true). So what do you do? Try to get 
referrals from people you know who have hired estate planning lawyers. If 
you have an accountant you trust, request a referral. You can also interview 
members of the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel (ACTEC), using 
its online directory (available at www.actec.org).
Hiring an accountant
Just as when you hire a lawyer, referrals are very useful when you need to hire 
an accountant. Your friends, family, business associates, and your lawyer may 
have suggestions. You can also consult your state’s CPA Association. You can 
find a directory of CPA Associations on The American Institute of Certified 
Public Accountants Web site at www.aicpa.org/states/stmap.htm.
When you have selected some possible CPAs, you should interview them. 
Questions to ask include
 
 How long have you been in practice?
 
 What are your qualifications and credentials?
 
 What is your experience with situations like mine?
 
 Do you specialize in servicing people with situations like mine?
 
 Will you personally handle my needs, or will the work be performed by 
somebody else within your office?

65
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Bequests
 
 How much do you charge, and does that price include all costs and fees?
 
 What services will I receive for that payment?
When you choose an accountant, consider the condition of the accountant’s 
offices. Are they neat and organized? That’s what you should expect. You can 
also rely upon your instincts. Do you trust the accountant and feel comfort-
able with the idea of working with the accountant? If not, it’s a big world. You 
have a lot of other accountants to choose from.
Using professional trust services 
(institutional trustees)
Your first thought upon hearing the words institutional trustee is probably, 
“that sounds expensive.” The most common institutional trustees are banks, 
brokerages, lawyers, and trust companies. They typically charge annual fees 
between 1 and 3 percent of the value of the trust.
An institutional trustee is thus likely to charge more than a friend or relative 
who serves as trustee, and you can’t expect that an institutional trustee will 
waive its fees. Unless your trust is valued at $400,000 or more, using an insti-
tutional trustee is probably not financially prudent. In fact, many institutional 
trustees will decline to service smaller estates.
Using an institutional trustee provides the benefit that your trustee is likely 
to be in operation for the entire life of the trust. At the same time, responsi-
bility for your trust may be handed off from employee to employee, due to 
staffing changes or employee turnover. You should inquire about continuity 
issues when you interview potential trustees.
You should consider having the trust periodically reviewed by a third party, 
to make sure that assets are being properly invested and maintained. This 
review adds an additional cost to your trust, but helps protect your heirs 
from mistakes or misconduct. Your institutional trustee should carry insur-
ance to protect you from losses resulting from any such problems.
An institutional trustee is likely to be objective when managing your estate. 
Except as clearly authorized by the trust, pleas from your children for the 
extra disbursement of funds will probably fall on deaf ears. An individual 
may be swayed by a family relationship or feelings of friendship. Similarly, 
while your children may decide that it makes no difference if they spend the 
money that they’re supposed to hold in trust for your grandchildren, your 
institutional trustee will do exactly what you instructed and make sure that 
your grandchildren receive your gift. Your institutional trustee will also not 
go through a period of grieving after your death or shy away from recovering 
trust assets from your friends or relatives.

66
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Institutional trustees are readily able to consult other professionals. While 
your individual trustee may struggle to find a lawyer or accountant who can 
give them advice on a minor problem, your institutional trustee can easily 
obtain advise from lawyers, accountants, investment professionals, and other 
experts. Also, even with staff turnover, the institutional trustee’s experience 
with trusts avoids the learning curve of an individual trustee who has little or 
no prior experience managing a trust.
 
Issues of self-dealing may arise with institutional trustees. The trustee may be 
inclined to invest the trust’s assets through the institution. You may want to 
mandate that part or all of the trust’s assets be invested through other institu-
tions so that the trustee will make the most suitable investments instead of 
favoring his employer’s investment vehicles. For smaller trusts, some institu-
tions will restrict investment options. Be aware of your institutional trustee’s 
practices before you choose it.
Loss of the personal touch
Historically, your institutional trustee may have 
been your small town bank manager who had 
worked in the same bank for many years and 
had a long-term personal relationship with you. 
The banking industry has evolved. Today, it’s 
exceptional to have that type of personal rela-
tionship with your banker.
Although a lack of relationship can help the 
trustee remain objective, the loss of a personal 
relationship may also affect your estate. While 
each of a succession of professional manag-
ers may do a perfectly competent job, they may 
miss a pattern that might be obvious to a trustee 
who has managed your trust from its inception.
A story that may not be true, but is illustrative 
of the problem, involves a wealthy woman who 
created a pet trust for the benefit of her dog. 
The trust provided for the woman’s house-
keeper to remain in her home and to draw a 
considerable salary to care for the home and 
dog for the duration of the dog’s life. She hired 
an institutional trustee to manage the trust.
A succession of employees of the trust com-
pany made dutiful inspections of the house at 
least once each year and confirmed that the 
dog was still alive. More than a decade later, 
when the dog would have been more than 20 
years old, a newly assigned employee recog-
nized that something was amiss. An inves-
tigation revealed that the dog had died. The 
housekeeper had purchased look-alike dogs 
and was on her third dog when her trickery was 
detected.

Providing for Your Children 
and Dependents
In This Chapter
 Choosing somebody to care for your minor children
 Safeguarding your child’s inheritance
 Providing for your child’s continuing financial needs
P
roviding for children is often the first concern of somebody creating an 
estate plan. Young children will need somebody to care for them and to 
manage their assets. An estate plan can also help adult children by providing 
for college or for supporting children with disabilities.
Choosing a Guardian
As the parent of a minor child, you are undoubtedly concerned about who 
will take care of your children in the event of your death. In most cases, a sur-
viving parent can provide care, but these issues can be particularly pressing 
for single parents.
Although in most cases your children will be cared for by their surviving 
parent, when that’s not possible, a court will appoint somebody to care for 
them. Although your choice of custodian, or personal guardian, for your 
minor children is subject to court approval, in most cases, a court will defer 
to your wishes. To best protect your children, you should select a primary 
custodian and an alternate custodian, somebody who will care for your chil-
dren if the primary custodian becomes unable or unwilling to serve.
In some cases, you and your spouse may disagree as to who should be the 
children’s custodian. You should strive to reach agreement, even if your 
choice is less than perfect, as otherwise the decision will be made for you by 
a court.

68
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Making the decision
Most of the time, parents want to keep their children together and will 
choose a custodian who is willing to care for all their children. In some situ-
ations, such as where your children have a large difference in age, you may 
want to designate more than one custodian based upon the individual needs 
of your children. For example, you may provide for a teenager to remain with 
a nearby family through the end of high school, while a grandparent cares for 
your younger children.
Questions to consider in choosing a custodian include
 
 How old is the custodian? Your designated custodian should be a legal 
adult under the laws of your state. In most cases, that’s the age of 18, 
but in a few states, the age of majority is 21.
 
 How qualified is your custodian? Does your choice have good parent-
ing skills and an appropriate personality and temperament? Can they 
provide a stable household environment?
 
 Does your custodian have any physical limitations? Caring for chil-
dren, and particularly for young children, can be physically taxing.
 
 Does your custodian have other priorities? Will your choice have the 
time to care for your children, even if doing so affects their work life, 
social life, or lifestyle?
 
 Does your custodian have other children? If so, how old are they, and 
how well would your children blend into the household?
 
 Does your custodian share your moral and religious beliefs? Will they 
continue to raise your child in your faith, or in a manner consistent with 
your morals?
 
 Can your custodian afford to take care of your children? If your estate 
is not sufficient to provide for the financial needs of your children, will 
your choice be able to make up the difference?
You should discuss these issues with possible custodians prior to making 
your choice. While I’m not suggesting that you interview possible custodians 
as if they’re applying for a job, this is a major decision, and it should thus be 
an informed decision.
 
You may choose to draft a letter to the custodian, to be kept with your will, 
which will remind them of your wishes for your children’s care. While the 
letter will not likely have any legal effect, it will remind the custodian of your 
wishes and may help ensure that they’re followed.

69
 Chapter 5: Providing for Your Children and Dependents
Choosing a guardian other than 
the noncustodial parent
 
In the case of divorce, if the noncustodial parent still has custody rights the 
law will presume that custody should go to that parent upon your death. You 
may be concerned that the noncustodial parent is not a suitable custodian. 
Although you may not be able to prevent that from happening, you can take 
steps to help protect your child:
 
 Designate a preferred custodian in your will. The other parent may die 
first or may opt not to take custody.
 
 Discuss your concerns with your designated custodian.
 
 Document the factual basis for your concerns and keep the documenta-
tion with your will.
 
 Consult a family lawyer in your state to formulate a plan to help keep the 
child out of the other parent’s custody.
 
 If necessary, provide for your estate to retain the services of a family 
lawyer who handles custody and guardianship proceedings.
If the noncustodial parent has abandoned the child or has a history of mental 
illness, abusive conduct toward the child, or substance abuse, you may be 
able to initiate guardianship proceedings shortly before or after your death, 
in which a court can consider appointing your preferred custodian as the 
child’s guardian. Please remember that custody and guardianship laws are 
different in each state, and this will not always be possible.
What if you can’t agree on a guardian?
You and your spouse have given a lot of thought 
to the question of who should care for your 
children if you die, but you just can’t agree. 
Please don’t give up yet. The consequences 
of not choosing a guardian are potentially far 
more serious than the consequences of picking 
somebody you believe is second best.
Start by interviewing your candidates. You may 
find that one of the preferred choices is unwilling 
to take on the responsibility of your children, or 
that a candidate looks less appealing once you’ve 
thoroughly examined their qualifications.
If, after your interviews, you’re both convinced 
that your preferred guardian is the best choice, 
take a look at the big picture. Are you arguing 
over the lesser of two evils? Or are you choosing 
between two qualified, appropriate candidates? 
If your disagreement is over two suitable, will-
ing guardians, consider a compromise, or even 
choosing by coin toss. Pick one candidate as 
guardian and the other as successor.

70
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Managing Your Child’s Assets
If you’re married, you may choose to leave your estate to your spouse and 
trust that your spouse will take care of your children’s needs. If you’re sepa-
rated or divorced, or simply wish to do so, you can make bequests to your 
minor children. However, from both practical and legal standpoints, children 
have very limited authority to manage their own assets.
When a child has assets beyond a few thousand dollars, an adult must help 
manage those assets. If you don’t designate a custodian for your child’s 
estate and the other parent is not available to care for your child, the funds 
will fall under court supervision and may be managed by a stranger, who will 
charge fees for services provided. Even if the court appoints a relative who 
does not charge fees, legal and accounting expenses may be incurred when 
they prepare annual reports for the court.
You will probably choose the same person to be your child’s custodian and to 
manage their assets. Most of the time, that person will be a surviving parent. 
Yet some people are wonderful with children, but terrible with money. If the 
person you select as caregiver for your children has poor financial skills, 
you can choose a different person to be custodian of their estate. Similarly, 
if you’re divorced and prefer that your ex-spouse not control your children’s 
inheritance, you may designate a different person or financial institution to 
serve as custodian.
 
The same considerations apply when choosing a custodian to care for your 
child or your child’s estate (see preceding section), but the emphasis shifts 
to the financial. Your choice should be a legal adult who is responsible with 
money, trustworthy, and has the time to handle your child’s assets. You will 
want to designate the primary custodian and also identify an alternate.
Conflict may arise between the person who oversees your child’s assets and 
the child’s custodian. You can minimize conflicts by:
 
 Trying to select people who will work in a cooperative, collaborative 
manner.
 
 Discussing in advance your wishes for how your children will be supported 
and how you want the children’s assets to be used for their support.
 
Depending upon your wishes and the size of your estate, you may create 
a trust to hold some or all of your children’s assets. The trust can include 
detailed provisions as to when money should and should not be paid out and 
can even provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts between the caregiver 
and the trustee. For more on trusts, see Part III.

 Chapter 5: Providing for Your Children and Dependents
Providing for Your Child’s Needs
You’ve taken care of your child’s physical care and financial well-being through 
adulthood. (See the section “Planning for the Care of Your Minor Children,” 
earlier in this chapter.) But what about providing for your child’s higher educa-
tion? What if your child has special needs, and an inheritance may jeopardize 
needed government benefits? What if you want to be sure that your child 
doesn’t fritter away the inheritance you worked so hard to provide?
The principal tool for managing your child’s inheritance is the trust fund, 
through which you designate a responsible person to hold and manage your 
children’s inheritance. A trust also gives you greater control over when your 
children will receive an inheritance, even after adulthood. While a few states 
let you postpone a child’s inheritance by a few years if you express that intent 
in your will, a trust is a much more powerful tool for controlling when and how 
your child will receive an inheritance. (For more on trusts, see Part III.)
Your child’s education
You may already have a savings account for your children’s future education. 
However, more formal savings tools, such as qualified tuition plans, Coverdell 
Accounts, and accounts under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, may pro-
vide tax advantages as you save toward your child’s college. Even diligent sav-
ings will not be sufficient to cover college expenses, and you may also want to 
provide for college through an inheritance, insurance, or trust.
You can use any form of trust to help fund your child’s college education, but 
using a trust for college savings does have some drawbacks. The trust will 
have to file an annual tax return and is taxed on its income, and the balance 
of the fund may affect your child’s eligibility for financial aid.
529 plan
A qualified tuition plan, commonly called a 529 plan, comes in two forms:
 
 A savings plan, into which you deposit funds to later be used for college 
expenses. Be aware that management fees for this type of account can 
be high, and investment choices are limited, so despite the tax advan-
tages, earnings may be low.
 
 In most states, a prepaid college tuition plan, where you can pay toward 
tuition at in-state colleges, with the savings guaranteed to increase in 
value at the same rate as college tuition. These plans are usually limited 
to state residents. You can apply the savings to private and out-of-state 
colleges, but even a fully funded plan may not fully cover those costs.

72
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Anybody can contribute to a 529 plan, so they provide an easy way for mem-
bers of your extended family to help contribute to your child’s future educa-
tion costs. Most states offer full or partial tax deductions for contributions to 
the plan. The assets are exempt from federal income taxes and are often also 
exempt from state and local taxes, and earnings accumulate on a tax-deferred 
basis. If your child dies or decides to not go to college, you can transfer the 
plan to another member of your family. For financial aid purposes, the plan is 
valued at an amount equal to the refund value of the plan.
Coverdell Account
A Coverdell Account (previously known as an education IRA) is funded with 
post-tax dollars and is maintained for the benefit of one beneficiary. You can 
contribute to a Coverdell Account for any child below the age of 18. As long 
as the money is used for education-related expenses, no tax is incurred on 
either the principal or interest earned when you make a withdrawal. Unlike 
other savings options, you can use the fund for K–12 education costs as well 
as for college costs. You have much greater flexibility with the investment 
of the funds than with a 529 savings plan. As the funds are considered to be 
an asset of the parents, there is no financial aid consequence to Coverdell 
Account savings.
Despite their advantages, Coverdell Accounts also have serious disadvan-
tages. Total annual contributions are limited to $2,000 per year, and high-
income parents may be subject to even lower limits. Also, your child must 
use the money from the account by the age of 30, or the account balance 
will be disbursed to your child subject to a 10 percent penalty and will be 
subject to taxes on its earnings. It may be possible at that time to change the 
beneficiary or roll over the account to another beneficiary, so another child 
or qualifying relative can benefit from the money without incurring those 
penalties, but the rollover process is very complex. You can find information 
on transfers and rollovers on the IRS Web site (presently at www.irs.gov/
publications/p970/ch07.html). Due to the low limits on contribution, 
the account’s management costs can consume or exceed its earnings.
UTMA trust
You can also use trusts and similar vehicles to save toward your children’s 
college expenses during your lifetime. One popular option is an account 
created under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA). Unlike other 
trusts, the terms of an UTMA trust are defined by statute. Gifts made into an 
UTMA account are irrevocable. The money you place into the minor’s UTMA 
account will fall under their control when they reach the age of majority, 
which in most states is the age of 18. Most states permit you to set a turnover 
age of 21.
 
If you’re concerned that your child is more likely to buy a car than budget for 
college, then the UTMA trust is unlikely to be your tool of choice.

73
 Chapter 5: Providing for Your Children and Dependents
Section 2503(c) trust
An option very similar to an UTMA is the Section 2503(c) trust, which is also 
created for the benefit of a person under the age of 21. You can make annual 
contributions to the trust up to the amount of the annual gift tax exclusion, 
presently $12,000. You can apply the principal and interest earned to college 
expenses. You can provide the child with the option to continue the trust 
past the age of 21, if he chooses not to withdraw their money at that time.
Crummey trust
A popular form of trust that also takes advantage of the annual gift tax exclu-
sion is called a Crummey trust. That name is not a judgment on its merits — it 
was named after its creator.
A Crummey trust can continue past the age of majority, but there is still a 
catch. The beneficiary is allowed to withdraw the gift only during a window 
of 30 to 60 days after each contribution. While most children understand that 
such a choice will probably result in that gift being the last you make, the 
money can still present a temptation.
 
Few choose this type of trust for college savings, as administrative costs of 
Crummey trusts tend to be high, and their entire balance will be treated as an 
asset when your child seeks financial aid.
Life insurance policy
One approach is to purchase a life insurance policy to pay college expenses. 
The best approach is to create a life insurance trust, to be funded by the 
policy upon your death. As your estate is not the beneficiary of the life insur-
ance benefit, the money is not subject to estate taxes. The trust can provide 
for the payment of tuition and living expenses during college and for how any 
balance is to be distributed to your child after graduation.
Your child’s special needs
If your child has a physical or mental disability that may require a lifetime of 
care, you may be torn between how to provide for your child and concern 
about how an inheritance would affect your child’s government benefits. 
Parents sometimes feel that their choices are limited to the following:
 
 Disinheriting the child.
 
 Directing a bequest to another child, with the understanding that the 
sibling will use the bequest to benefit their disabled child.
 
 Ignoring possible financial consequences, and making a bequest to the 
disabled child.

74
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
These approaches are all far from perfect, and each can frustrate your goal of 
providing for your child. Fortunately, you have another option — the special 
needs trust. This type of trust can hold your child’s inheritance without putting 
government benefits at risk or causing them to be discontinued.
 
Creating a special needs trust is complex, as is the interplay of Medicaid, SSI 
and other government benefits. For special needs planning and the creation of 
a special needs trust, you should get help from a qualified lawyer.
Your child’s financial stability
While your child is not likely to object to inheriting a large sum of money as 
a young adult, you may be frightened by the idea. No matter how mature and 
responsible your child may be, she may not be wise with her inheritance.
While a few states provide you with a limited ability to delay inheritance, if 
you state that wish in your will, most will allow your child to take control of 
an inheritance at the age of 18. None will delay inheritance past the age of 25.
If you do not want your child to inherit as a young adult or want to provide 
for inheritance of only a portion of your bequest at that time, your best solu-
tion is to create a trust. A trust will not only give you that flexibility, but will 
also allow you to provide for special disbursements in the event of special 
events, achievements, or emergencies.
 
If your child has a history of substance abuse, irresponsible gambling, or wild 
spending, you can utilize a form of asset protection trust called a spendthrift 
trust to help ensure that your child can’t squander his inheritance. The trust 
disburses money on a schedule or under circumstances you define. Your child 
can’t borrow against the balance of the trust fund, nor can creditors attach it 
as security for loans. A valid spendthrift trust will even survive your child’s 
bankruptcy.
An asset protection trust can also help protect your child’s inheritance in the 
event of divorce. While most states will compel the trust to pay child sup-
port or spousal support from the trust, the funds within the trust will not be 
considered part of the marital estate and thus will not be subject to division 
in divorce.

t’s an unfortunate truth that if you owe money during your life, your 
estate will owe money when you die. And the saying, “Nothing is certain 
but death and taxes?” There is probably no context where that statement is 
more true than with estate taxes.
When you plan your estate, you should consider the probable liabilities of your 
estate, including outstanding bills, mortgages and other loans, income taxes, 
estate and gift taxes, and the cost of probate proceedings. With a good estate 
plan, you can reduce the cost of probate and trust administration, provide for 
the payment of your bills and debts, and do a lot to avoid estate taxes.
In this chapter, I provide an overview of estate taxes, common tools used in 
tax planning and tax avoidance, and the costs and benefits of those tools.
Tallying Up Your Estate’s Tax Liabilities
Your estate has two primary sources of tax liability:
 
 Income taxes from your last year of life
 
 Estate and gift taxes

76
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Your estate consists of the value of all property in which you had an interest 
at the time of your death. Your personal representative will prepare an inven-
tory of your estate’s assets and their worth, including assets held by your 
living trust. Based upon the value of your estate, you may owe both state and 
federal estate taxes.
You can take one of three general approaches to estate taxes:
 
 Acquiescence: Even though you know that the IRS will take a significant 
percentage of your estate, you do nothing to prevent that event from 
happening.
 
 Acceptance: You enter into a basic estate plan, perhaps using a bypass 
trust so that your estate benefits from the exemptions of both you and 
your spouse, but otherwise accept that part of your estate will go to 
the IRS.
 
 Resistance: You engage in more aggressive tax avoidance strategies to 
minimize your estate’s tax exposure.
 
I recommend engaging in some amount of resistance. If your estate is taxable, 
you will almost always be able to find ways to significantly reduce its tax burden.
Federal estate taxes — a moving target
With current estate tax exemptions, most estates don’t have to pay estate 
taxes. As of the time of writing, the estate tax exemption is $2 million. The 
exemption rises to $3.5 million in 2009, and the estate tax is eliminated in 
2010. Yet the repeal is temporary. Unless new legislation is passed, the estate 
tax exemption will revert to $1 million. At present, the nonexempt balance of 
your estate is taxed at the rate of 45 percent.
Few expect that the estate tax repeal will be made permanent. The greatest 
uncertainty is for estates valued between $1.5 million to $4 million, as after 
the next round of legislation, the estate tax exemption is expected to fall 
somewhere within that range.
 
When owed, estate taxes take a significant bite out of your estate. The current 
estate tax rate is 45 percent. If you don’t plan and implement an effective tax 
avoidance strategy, once you have taken advantage of your estate tax exemp-
tion, the IRS will take almost half of your assets.
The generation-skipping transfer tax
A close cousin of the federal estate tax is the generation-skipping transfer tax 
(GST). The idea of generation skipping is simple: If you have a large estate 

77
 Chapter 6: Dipping into Your Pocket: The Tax Man (and Others)
and leave it to your children, they’ll also pay estate taxes when they in turn 
leave their estates to their grandchildren. By placing part of your estate in 
a generation-skipping trust for the benefit of your grandchildren, you avoid 
the second round of estate taxation. Also, the money directed to your grand-
children is largely protected from your children’s creditors or from being 
claimed by an ex-spouse if one of your children divorces.
The generation-skipping transfer tax has a lifetime exemption in the same 
amount as the estate tax exemption, currently $2 million. You can allocate 
your exemption among your generation-skipping gifts. Above the exemption, 
the double hit of estate tax and generation-skipping taxes is almost confisca-
tory, and the combined tax can easily consume 80 percent of your bequest.
Consider the following examples:
 
 During your lifetime, you make a $1 million gift to your grandchild. You 
don’t allocate either GST or gift tax exemptions to the gift. Applying 
current tax rates and assuming that you live at least three years after 
making the gift, your total cost for that $1 million gift is more than 
$2 million ($1 million, plus $450,000 in gift taxes, plus $450,000 in GST 
taxes, plus $202,500 in gift tax on the GST tax).
 
 If you want to leave $1 million to your grandchild through your estate, 
again without allocating either gift tax exemptions or GST exemptions to 
the gift, estate and GST taxes will be approximately $1.6 million, meaning 
that for $1 million to reach your grandchild, it will cost your estate 
$2.6 million.
Although the generation-skipping transfer tax is slated to expire along with 
the estate tax, you can realistically expect that both will return with the next 
round of estate tax legislation.
 
The rules governing the generation-skipping tax are complicated, and you can 
accidentally make a gift that implicates this tax.
State estate taxes
Most states impose estate taxes or inheritance taxes. Your estate pays estate 
taxes. The recipient of an inheritance pays inheritance taxes.
Prior to estate tax reform, many states imposed pick-up taxes, which are 
taxes in the amount of the federal State Death Tax Credit (SDTC). State estate 
taxes that fall within the SDTC don’t raise the total tax burden on your estate. 
Due to the phase-out of the federal estate tax, many states have amended 
their estate tax laws to ensure continued revenue. That is to say, even if the 
federal estate tax repeal is made permanent, in most states, you’ll continue to 
pay state estate taxes.

78
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Gift taxes
If you make a lot of gifts during your lifetime, you may have to pay gift taxes. 
Gift tax exemptions fall into three categories under federal tax law:
 
 Your annual exemption, presently $12,000 per person, per year. (If 
you’re married, you and your spouse can each make gifts up to the 
amount of the annual exemption, such that you could give each of your 
children up to $24,000 per year without incurring gift taxes.)
 
 Your lifetime exemption, presently $1 million. Gifts falling within the 
annual gift tax exemption don’t count toward your lifetime exemption.
 
 Gifts to your U.S. citizen spouse of any amount. These gifts are exempt 
from gift taxes and aren’t counted toward your lifetime exemption. If 
your spouse isn’t a citizen, the gift tax exemption is substantial, in the 
amount of $128,000 in 2008 and indexed to inflation.
In addition, some gifts aren’t subject to the gift tax:
 
 Gifts of tuition made directly to the educational institution (not to the 
student). Gifts directed into a 529 College Savings Plan also have a five-
year gift exclusion so that you can gift up to $60,000 into a plan in a single 
year instead of spreading the gift over five consecutive years — but you 
have to wait five years before making another gift to the recipient.
 
 Gifts of medical expenses or health insurance made directly to the 
medical facility or insurer (not to the patient). Gifts made directly to the 
patient in excess of the standard annual gift tax exclusion are not exempt, 
even if the patient uses your gifts to pay medical bills and insurance costs.
 
 Gifts to tax-exempt charities. Your gift to a tax-exempt charity is exempt 
from gift taxes and may also provide an income tax deduction.
 
 Gifts to a political organization. A gift made to a qualifying political 
organization for its own use is exempt from gift tax, but does not give 
you an income tax deduction.
Also, if you add a joint account holder to your savings or investment 
accounts, no gift occurs until they withdraw money.
How gift taxes affect you
You’re probably looking at these exemptions and exceptions and wondering, 
“How many people actually have to pay gift taxes?” The answer: Not many. 
But without a gift tax, it would become easy for large estates to partially or 
completely avoid estate taxes, through the creative use of gifts and trusts.

79
 Chapter 6: Dipping into Your Pocket: The Tax Man (and Others)
The lifetime exemption is not as glorious as it may sound. The amount of gifts 
falling within that exemption is counted toward your taxable estate. Also, 
for gifts that exceed the annual gift tax exemption, estate taxes are normally 
imposed on gifts made within three years of death as if they remain part of 
the estate. If you take advantage of your annual exemption during your last 
month of life, giving each of your children $12,000, those gifts will reduce 
your taxable estate. But if you make a gift of $500,000, your gift in excess of 
the $12,000 annual exemption is still treated as part of your estate for the cal-
culation of estate taxes.
Filing gift tax returns
If you make gifts, you may be required to file a Form 709 Gift Tax Return for 
that tax year. Whether or not tax is due, you must file a gift tax return if you 
meet any of the following criteria:
 
 You make gifts valued at more than your annual exemption to any indi-
vidual other than your spouse, unless they fall under one of the excep-
tions. (See the “Gifts” section, earlier in this chapter.)
 
 You make a gift of a future interest, even if the value of the future interest 
is less than your annual exemption. A future interest is an ownership inter-
est in property that doesn’t include the right to present possession or use 
of the property. For example, if you transfer real estate so that you retain 
a life estate, but somebody else (your remainderman) gains possession 
after you die, the remainderman has a future interest in the real estate.
 
 You and your spouse split a gift. In that case, you must both file gift tax 
returns. For example, if you and your spouse give your child $24,000 and 
want to take advantage of both of your annual gift tax exemptions, you 
will split the gift and will each file a gift tax return reporting a $12,000 gift.
 
 If you make a gift of community property, property you hold with your 
spouse as joint tenants, or property you hold as tenants by the entirety, 
the IRS considers half of the gift to be made by your spouse, and both 
you and your spouse must file a gift tax return.
You don’t need to file a gift tax return for a year in which you make no gifts to 
your spouse, don’t make any gifts in excess of your annual exemption to any 
individual, and all the gifts you made were of present interests.
 
There is no such thing as a joint gift tax return. You and your spouse are each 
responsible to file your own Form 709.
Gift taxes are payable by you, as the donor. However, if you fail to pay gift taxes 
owed, the IRS may seek to collect the taxes from the recipient of your gift.
If you die before filing your gift tax return, your personal representative must 
file the return on behalf of your estate.

Minimizing Tax Costs and Liabilities
You can take comfort in your ability to avoid estate taxes through the use of 
trusts and gifting strategies. Please be aware that tax avoidance strategies 
can be much more complicated than they may appear.
 
Although this chapter discusses many techniques that you can use to reduce 
your estate tax exposure, many of them are difficult to implement. If your 
estate is large enough to incur estate taxes, you should consider seeking pro-
fessional estate planning services.
The uncertain future of the estate tax, with unpredictable future gift and 
estate tax exemptions, make creating a solid tax strategy difficult. Whatever 
your strategy, you should update your estate plan after the next round of 
estate tax legislation.
Although the future of the estate tax isn’t certain, the most likely outcome of 
estate tax reform is an increased exemption and not total repeal.
 
Beware the following estate planning myths:
 
 Myth: Your revocable living trust is a shield from estate taxes.
 
 Fact: You may believe that your revocable living trust protects your 
assets from the tax man, but that isn’t correct. While a basic revocable 
living trust helps you prepare for incapacity, avoid probate, and manage 
the distribution of your assets, it does nothing to avoid estate taxes. 
Everything you put into your revocable living trust is included in the 
value of your estate when you die. You can incorporate tax-saving tools 
into your revocable living trust, but there is no automatic tax benefit.
 
 Myth: Adding your heirs to the title of your real estate and financial 
accounts automatically shields those assets from estate taxes.
 
 Fact: Adding a joint owner to real estate or a bank account normally 
allows that asset to pass to the joint owner outside of probate, but does 
not reduce the value of the asset to your taxable estate. Chapter 17 
discusses additional reasons not to use joint ownership as an estate 
planning tool.
Leaving your estate to your spouse
One of the easiest ways to avoid estate taxes is to give your assets to your 
surviving spouse. Your spouse enjoys an unlimited marital deduction, and 
thus your gift is free of estate taxes. But, as you probably expected, this strat-
egy isn’t perfect.

81
 Chapter 6: Dipping into Your Pocket: The Tax Man (and Others)
From a practical standpoint, you may not want to leave your spouse in full 
control of your estate — for example, in a second marriage, where your 
spouse remarries after your death or may not be inclined to follow your 
instruction to leave money to children from your first marriage.
In addition, by leaving your entire estate to your spouse, you also may be 
missing an opportunity to avoid a lot of taxes:
 
 You and your spouse each enjoy an estate tax exemption, currently 
valued at $2 million.
 
 If you give your entire estate to your spouse, although your gift to your 
spouse isn’t taxed, your spouse’s bequests aren’t taking advantage of 
your $2 million exemption.
 
 If you leave $2 million (or the amount of the exemption at the time of 
your death) to your other heirs, that money doesn’t become part of your 
spouse’s estate. When your spouse dies, their estate also benefits from 
the $2 million exemption, effectively doubling the amount you can leave 
to your heirs tax-free.
 
If you leave part of your estate to your other heirs, will your spouse have 
enough money? You can create a bypass trust (also known as a credit shelter 
trust) and leave the money to your other heirs through that trust. Although 
you must limit your spouse’s access to the trust, you can provide for the 
trust’s income to go to your spouse, permit your spouse to withdraw up to 
5 percent of the value of the trust annually, and even allow your spouse to 
use the trust’s assets as necessary for support or medical expenses. You can 
also appoint your spouse as trustee. Yet as the trust assets aren’t part of your 
spouse’s estate, it’s not subject to estate tax when your spouse dies.
Making gifts
Another significant tax avoidance technique is gifting. You can reduce your 
taxable estate by making gifts to tax-exempt charities and political organiza-
tions. You can also plan a gifting strategy for your lifetime so that you can 
pass assets to your heirs tax-free:
 
 You can take advantage of your annual gift tax exclusion by making annual 
gifts of up to $12,000. If you and your spouse both make gifts, you can give 
a single recipient up to $24,000 per year without incurring gift taxes.
 
 You can make unlimited gifts of tuition, the cost of medical care, or the 
cost of health insurance, making the payment directly to the institution 
or insurer. Don’t make these payments to the beneficiary of your gift, or 
you’ll lose the benefit of this exemption.

82
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
 
 You can reduce the value of your estate by making gifts to tax-exempt 
charities and political organizations. Note that if your primary goal with 
your charitable giving is to limit estate taxes, you need to update your 
plan any time the exemption increases.
You can also take full advantage of your $1 million lifetime gift tax exemption 
while you’re alive. For you and your spouse, that’s a combined total of 
$2 million.
Capital gains taxes
For tax purposes, basis is the value used to calculate taxable gains and losses 
when property is sold. Generally, your basis in your home is its value at the 
time you bought it plus the value of certain improvements (for example, a 
new roof or replacement of a furnace).
When your heirs inherit your property, under current law, they receive 
stepped up basis. The value of the property is determined as of the date of 
your death, and the basis is stepped up to that amount. If your heirs sell the 
inherited property, they pay only capital gains taxes on the increase in its 
value during the time they owned it.
When you give somebody a gift, the recipient gets carryover basis, meaning 
that the basis they receive is the same as yours. When you add somebody as 
a joint titleholder during your lifetime, you open up the possibility of gift tax 
exposure.
Imagine that you purchased a vacation home for $60,000 in 1980, and it has a 
present value of $300,000. If you give the home to your child, you use $300,000 
of your lifetime gift tax exemption. For capital gains taxes, your children 
receive carryover basis of $60,000, the amount you paid for the property. If, on 
the other hand, you continue to hold the home in your estate, and it’s worth 
$350,000 when you die, the additional $50,000 in appreciation will be part of 
your estate and subject to estate taxes. However, your heirs will inherit your 
home with a stepped up basis of $350,000. You must weigh potential estate tax 
benefits against capital gains consequences for your heirs.
Charitable remainder trusts
In addition to outright gifts to charities, you can enter into more complicated 
arrangements. The most popular is the charitable remainder trust.
In a traditional charitable remainder trust, you make a gift to charity and 
receive an annual income in return. For example, you place $1 million into 
your charitable remainder trust, with the trust providing for an income to 
you of 10 percent, or $100,000 per year. The charity (or trustee you appoint 
to manage the trust on behalf of the charity) invests the money and receives 
the balance of the trust upon your death.

83
 Chapter 6: Dipping into Your Pocket: The Tax Man (and Others)
In a reverse charitable remainder trust, the charity receives the income stream 
from the trust during your lifetime, and the balance of the trust passes to 
your heirs upon your death.
As the trust has a charitable nature, assets you transfer into the trust may 
be sold without payment of capital gains tax. You can thus use a charitable 
remainder trust to avoid capital gain taxes on assets that have significantly 
appreciated since you acquired them. Your $50,000 investment in Google 
is now worth $250,000? If you sell your Google shares, you will pay capital 
gains tax on the $200,000 gain, but if those shares are held by your charitable 
remainder trust, no taxes are paid and the full $250,000 can be reinvested by 
your trustee.
 
When creating your gifting strategy, don’t forget your own future needs. I’m 
not suggesting that you avoid estate taxes by making so many gifts that you’re 
unable to support yourself. Remember, you can also reduce your taxable 
estate simply by spending your money.
Using trusts to avoid estate taxes
You can use many other trusts to avoid estate taxes. Commonly used trusts 
include
 
 The qualified personal residence trust (QPRT), also known as a house 
trust: You place your house into a trust, naming your children as ben-
eficiaries. This action effectively freezes the value of your home for 
estate tax purposes. Once the trust owns the home, the appreciation is 
Not all charities are created equal
If you give money to an established charity or 
educational institution, you have a pretty good 
idea of how your money will be used. But what 
if you want to support a small charity or offbeat 
cause? You have to be careful to avoid chari-
ties that aren’t competently managed or that 
are run by people who are more interested in 
lining their own pockets than contributing to the 
charity’s cause.
My advice is to thoroughly investigate the char-
ity before giving it any money. Ask for its annual 
report and financial statement. If it refuses to 
provide those documents, I suggest finding a 
different charity for your donation. With those 
documents in hand, evaluate how much of 
the charity’s spending goes to its charitable 
causes, versus paying for salaries, overhead, 
and fundraising.

Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
attributed to your trust and not your estate. When the trust ends, your 
children become the owners of your home and your landlords. In order 
for this trust to succeed, you must continue to occupy your home as 
your residence and you must survive the term of the trust. Although 
your QPRT can last for as long or as short a time as you want, if you die 
before the trust ends the IRS will treat the home as part of your estate.
 
 The grantor retained interest trust (GRIT): You place an asset into the 
trust, retain the right to receive income from the asset, but otherwise 
place it outside of your estate. At the end of the trust, the trust’s assets 
are transferred to the beneficiary. Neither you nor your spouse may serve 
as trustee. The tax code also limits the effectiveness of these trusts in 
transferring assets to your spouse, siblings, and children. As with the 
house trust you can make the term of the trust as long or as short as you 
want, if you die before the trust ends the IRS will treat the trust’s assets as 
part of your estate. Closely related to this trust are the grantor retained 
unitrusts (GRUTs) and grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs).
 
 The generation-skipping trust, sometimes called a dynasty trust: You 
place money in trust for the benefit of your grandchildren. You may allow 
your children to receive the income generated by the trust. Because your 
children never own the trust assets, those assets never become a tax-
able part of their estates. (For more on this topic, see the section “The 
generation-skipping transfer tax,” earlier in this chapter.) Gifts above your 
generation skipping tax exemption are taxed at an extremely high rate.
 
 The irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT): The trust purchases a life 
insurance policy and is named as the beneficiary of that policy, keeping 
the insurance proceeds out of your estate. The insurance policy must 
be acquired by the trust at least three years before you die, or the pro-
ceeds will be included in your taxable estate.
 
Please note that all these trusts are irrevocable. Once you create them, you 
can’t change your mind and pull your assets back out. Also, they’re compli-
cated to create and are best drafted by an estate planning professional.
Chapter 12 discusses these trusts in more detail.
Creating a Family Limited Partnership
The Family Limited Partnership is another popular estate planning tool for 
larger estates. When used properly, the Family Limited Partnership can 
reduce estate and gift tax exposure, protect assets from creditors, and facili-
tate business succession. In a typical Family Limited Partnership:
 
 You and your spouse create a formal limited partnership, a separate 
legal entity with its own taxpayer identification number, and transfer 
assets into the partnership. You and your spouse each hold 50 percent 
ownership of the limited partnership.

85
 Chapter 6: Dipping into Your Pocket: The Tax Man (and Others)
 
 You and your spouse retain all management authority, but make gifts of 
your limited partner interest to your children.
 
 Due to the lack of input into management of the business and lack of 
marketability, your children’s limited partnership shares are discounted 
in value. For example, if you hold $1 million of assets in the limited part-
nership and make a gift of 2 percent of the partnership to your child, 
before the discount, the gift would be worth $20,000 and would exceed 
your annual gift tax exclusion. With a 40 percent discount due to restric-
tions on the shares, the value of your gift would be only $12,000 and 
would fall within the annual gift tax exclusion.
You can create a Family Limited Partnership where your children (or other 
beneficiaries of your gifts) manage the partnership and you hold the limited 
interest. The discount is applied to the share held by your estate, such that 
if your partnership shares are worth $2 million, a 40-percent discount would 
reduce its taxable value to your estate to $1.2 million.
As you can see, this tool can accelerate the transfer of assets to your heirs 
and significantly reduce your taxable estate. The Family Limited Partnership 
may also help protect your assets from your creditors.
 
By the same token, the IRS is very aware of Family Limited Partnerships and 
is hostile to them, particularly where it deems the discount claimed by your 
estate to be excessive. Many mistakes are common in creating and administer-
ing a Family Limited Partnership, and these errors can reduce or eliminate its 
value as a tax avoidance tool. I recommend that you hire an estate planning 
professional to create your Family Limited Partnership.
 
Please recall that this list of estate tax avoidance techniques isn’t exhaustive. 
Your estate planner may recommend additional tools based upon your goals 
and the size of your estate.
Seeing the Big Picture: Tax Avoidance 
Should Not Dictate Your Estate Plan
Even if you detest the idea of giving the IRS a penny of your estate, you need 
to step back and consider how tax avoidance strategies affect your estate 
plan. Tax planning can be complicated and expensive for you:
 
 Creating an effective estate tax avoidance plan is complicated. If you try 
to do it yourself, you may make a mistake such that your estate pays 
taxes despite your efforts.
 
 Professional tax planning services can be expensive, and the more com-
plicated your plan, the more expensive those services will be.

86
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
 
 With the estate tax in a state of uncertainty, your estate tax avoidance 
plan may soon require significant revision.
 
 While you can avoid estate tax through gifts and certain irrevocable 
trusts, you limit or eliminate your own ability to use those assets.
Your estate plan can also complicate the administration of your trusts and 
estate, resulting in increased fees and costs. It can complicate when and how 
your heirs receive their inheritances.
 
When you create your estate plan, consider how you can avoid estate taxes. 
But don’t lose track of the primary purpose of an estate plan: leaving your 
assets to your heirs in the manner of your choosing.
Paying Your Estate’s Debts
Although your heirs can’t inherit your debts, your estate remains on the hook. 
Your creditors may make claims with your estate for money you owe, and your 
bills are paid prior to the distribution of your bequests to your heirs.
Often, your heirs can take advantage of exemptions that partially shield your 
estate from your creditors. When an exemption applies, your heirs can retain 
ownership or use of certain property, even if it means that creditors go unpaid. 
The availability and amount of these exceptions are different in each state.
 
 Under the homestead exemption, your primary residence may be fully or 
partially protected from your creditors, and certain family members may 
be granted a right to occupy your homestead despite the claims of credi-
tors. In some states the homestead exemption is very small, only a few 
thousand dollars, while other states shield the entire value of your home.
 
 The personal property exemption allows your spouse and minor chil-
dren to retain certain items of personal property. The amount of this 
exemption is usually between $10,000 and $50,000.
 
 Some states permit a court to grant family allowance, payments of 
money to help support your surviving spouse and minor children. The 
payment is usually based upon the amount of money your family needs 
to support itself in the same manner as when you were alive, and pay-
ments usually last one year. Some states will continue family allowance 
payments until the estate is closed, even if that takes more than a year.
 
Your administrator must remember to follow proper procedure and not simply 
pay off your bills as they come in. If your estate has limited assets, that approach 
may leave your estate without sufficient assets to pay your higher priority bills.
Although state laws vary on the procedure, the following steps outline the 
general process of how your estate pays your bills:

87
 Chapter 6: Dipping into Your Pocket: The Tax Man (and Others)
 
1. Your personal representative gathers information about your debts.
 
2. Your creditors are notified that you have died and that they must 
make a claim against your estate within a specified period of time, 
usually one to four months.
 
 Notice is normally given by publication or by mail.
 
3. Creditors submit their claims.
 
 If a creditor receives proper notice and doesn’t submit a timely claim, 
the claim is likely to be barred (that is, the creditor forever loses any 
right to payment).
 
4. Your personal representative accepts or rejects creditors’ claims.
 
5. If a claim is rejected, the creditor must promptly file a claim with the 
probate court.
 
6. The list of approved claims to the probate court for approval.
 
7. If the list is approved, the listed debts are paid from your estate’s assets.
If your estate lacks sufficient funds to pay all your debts, the debts are priori-
tized according to state law, and creditors with higher priority are paid first. 
Each state has its own law defining which debts have priority. The following 
list is typical, although the details may be different in your state:
 
 Expenses of estate administration, including court costs, attorney fees, 
and the fees of your personal representative.
 
 Secured debts, such as mortgages, deeds of trust, and liens
 
 Funeral expenses
 
 Expenses of your last illness
 
 Spousal and family allowance
 
 Wage claims made by your employees
 
 Debts and taxes with priority under federal law
 
 Debts and taxes with priority under state law
 
 All other debts
Medical costs and Medicaid 
reimbursements
Your final medical bills, to the extent that they’re not covered by insur-
ance, have high priority for payment. Another liability arises if you received 
Medicaid benefits. State Medicaid recovery laws permit state governments to 
pursue the assets of your estate as reimbursement for Medicaid benefits you 
received during your lifetime.

88
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Typically, the state files a claim against your estate, specifying the amount to 
be reimbursed. The claim applies to all the property you own at the time of 
your death. Reimbursement claims typically includes the cost to Medicaid of
 
 The cost of nursing home care, or of home or community-based care
 
 Hospital services
 
 Prescription medications
Your heirs do have some degree of protection through hardship exemptions 
and, more typically, through deferrals. A hardship exemption requires a dem-
onstration of undue hardship, a standard that is both subjective and difficult 
to meet. Medicaid recovery will typically be deferred in situations where:
 
 You have a surviving spouse.
 
 Your household includes minor children, or adult children who are blind 
or permanently disabled.
Once your surviving spouse dies or your minor child reaches adulthood, the 
state will again pursue your assets.
 
The federal government encourages states to seek reimbursement from 
Medicaid recipients, and states are becoming more aggressive in pursuing 
reimbursement. You can’t simply transfer assets out of your name to avoid 
reimbursing the state. The law provides for look-back periods during which 
transfers into trusts and transfers for less than market value can result in 
Medicaid ineligibility. Also, the net result of your gift may be that the govern-
ment can immediately reach assets to pay for your care that would otherwise 
have been subject to an exemption or deferral.
Please remember that despite Medicaid reimbursement, your estate may 
save money by taking advantage of Medicaid benefits. A nursing home that 
may charge $65,000 per year for private pay clients may charge only $45,000 
per year for Medicaid clients. Even if your estate ultimately pays the $45,000 
annual cost, you still save $20,000 per year over private payment.
If you expect to receive Medicaid benefits, you should consult a qualified 
professional to assist you with Medicaid planning. While Medicaid planning 
probably will not shield your estate from the government or increase the 
amount you can leave to your heirs, it can make your life a lot more comfort-
able. For example, you may be able to preserve your savings to cover items 
not paid for by Medicaid, including:
 
 A private room
 
 Supplemental care, such as a geriatric care manager or companion 
caregiver

89
 Chapter 6: Dipping into Your Pocket: The Tax Man (and Others)
 
 Eyeglasses, hearing aids, and dentures
 
 Beauty shop visits
 
This type of Medicaid planning is legal and ethical. You don’t need to feel 
guilty about preserving your assets.
Payment of bills, loans, and mortgages
Most of your bills aren’t paid until the probate court approves the list of 
approved claims submitted by your personal representative.
Some of the obligations of your estate require payments to be made before the 
estate closes. Your personal representative will pay your mortgage payments, 
utility bills, and homeowner’s insurance premiums while your estate remains 
open. Your personal representative may also have to make car payments and 
maintain auto insurance, if you own a car at the time of your death.
If your estate includes real property that is subject to a mortgage, your mort-
gage lender will require repayment. If your estate can’t afford the mortgage, 
your heir may take the property subject to the debt and attempt to assume the 
mortgage or refinance, or the real estate may be sold to pay the mortgage debt.
 
You can obtain insurance to protect your heirs from mortgages. You can pur-
chase mortgage life insurance, which pays off the mortgage balance when you 
die. You can also consider simply purchasing a term life policy sufficient to 
pay off your mortgage. Term life insurance is usually cheaper than mortgage 
life insurance.
Payment of funeral expenses
Your personal representative is responsible for arranging your funeral, and 
paying the costs of your funeral and burial. Funeral expenses may include
 
 The funeral home bill
 
 The cost of the reception after your funeral
 
 Stipends for clergy
 
 Your gravestone
 
Most states give funeral expenses very high priority, such that if your estate 
has limited assets, the funeral costs are paid before most other bills. A state 
may prioritize payment of funeral expenses ahead of federal taxes, although a 
tax return must still be filed.

90
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
Covering Administration Costs
No matter how you leave your estate to your heirs, there will be costs. Some of 
the costs are unavoidable, while others may be reduced with the estate plan-
ning tools discussed in this book. The most significant costs your estate will 
incur are usually legal fees, as well as the fees and expenses of your trustee or 
personal administrator. Those costs are described in the following sections.
Don’t forget that the costs of administering your estate include the costs of 
caring for your property and of distributing your bequests. For example:
 
 If you have real estate, it must be maintained and insured.
 
 Somebody will have to clean your belongings out of your house or 
apartment.
 
 If the real estate is sold, your estate may pay commissions to a real 
estate agent.
 
 If you make bequests of property that must be stored or shipped to your 
heirs, unless you provide otherwise, your estate will bear the cost of 
storage, shipping, and insurance.
Court costs
The actual cost of opening an estate in probate court is modest. Filing fees 
are usually no more than a few hundred dollars. Litigation can increase court 
costs if, for example, the estate
 
 Files a lawsuit, such as a wrongful death claim, and incurs the costs 
associated with the lawsuit
 
 Defends itself against litigation, such as a will contest
This amount doesn’t mean that probate is a bargain. Remember that court 
costs don’t include either lawyer fees or fees paid to the administrator of 
your estate.
Legal fees
Although a personal representative can probate your estate without the help 
of a lawyer, anticipate that your estate will pay legal fees.

91
 Chapter 6: Dipping into Your Pocket: The Tax Man (and Others)
The amount of legal fees permitted varies by state, with some states authoriz-
ing the attorney to charge a “reasonable fee,” others awarding a fee to be set 
by the court, and some setting the fee as a percentage of the value of your 
estate. Where an attorney handles the probate process, expect the total fee 
to be between 2 to 5 percent of your estate.
Administrator’s fees
The personal representative of your estate is entitled to compensation for 
services performed in the administration of your estate. The amount an exec-
utor may charge depends upon state law and typically is 2 to 5 percent of the 
value of your estate. The fee may be higher depending upon the complexity 
of your estate. If state law provides for hourly fees, or fees based upon the 
reasonable value of services performed, your personal representative’s fee 
will be subject to court approval.
Your personal representative may require professional assistance with your 
estate, and your estate pays for those services as well. In addition to legal 
fees, for example, your personal representative may require help from an 
accountant or appraiser. You can help minimize these expenses by
 
 Discussing your estate with your personal representative
 
 Making sure that your taxes are paid and that your finances are in order
 
 Ensuring that your personal representative knows where your property 
is located
 
 Making sure that your personal representative knows what types of ser-
vices are likely to be required by your estate, and what they can reason-
ably be expected to cost
 
Often a relative or close friend will agree to serve as personal representative 
without a fee, or for an agreed-upon fee. Discuss this fee with your personal 
representative and successor and describe the agreed compensation in your 
will. Serving as personal representative is hard work and can be emotionally 
difficult. Unless the personal representative is your sole or primary heir, I sug-
gest providing compensation.
Absent an agreement, expect that your personal representative will charge 
and collect a fee. Be careful about setting too low a fee, as the role of per-
sonal representative is often difficult and time-consuming, and an undercom-
pensated personal representative may resign.

92
Part I: Getting Started with Your Will or Trust 
If your personal representative has to post a bond, your estate will pay the 
cost of the bond. The bond is similar to insurance for your estate, in the 
event that the personal representative mishandles or misappropriates assets. 
If you want, some states permit you to waive the bond requirement in your 
will, or you can specifically require that the executor post a bond.
Trustee’s fees
You can avoid much of the expense of probate by passing your assets 
through a trust. Yet a trust carries expenses of its own.
Like your personal representative in probate court, your trustee can charge 
fees. Your trustee may also require professional services, including legal and 
accounting services.
You may define within your trust the compensation your trustee is to receive. If 
you don’t, your trustee will be permitted to charge a reasonable fee for services 
rendered. That fee may be hourly, or it may be a percentage (often about 1 per-
cent per year) of the value of the trust’s assets. Professional trust services often 
charge annual fees in the range of 0.75 to 1.25 percent of the trust’s assets.
 
Be careful to understand what services your trustee will provide, and what 
services are offered at an additional fee. If you’re using an institutional trustee, 
you should have a clear understanding of their fees and the services your 
trust will receive for those fees, including:
 
 One time fees, such as fees for setting up the trust accounts, or trust ter-
mination fees
 
 Annual fees, and the services included in the annual fee
 
 Service fees not included in the annual fee, such as fees for preparing tax 
returns or annual trust reports
 
 Extraordinary fees (fees for services outside of the normal scope of trust 
administration), and how those fees are assessed
Don’t rule out institutional trustees based upon cost alone. Sometimes an 
institutional trustee will be the best choice for your trust (see Chapter 4).

Everything You 
Need to Know 
about Wills

In this part . . .
T
his part guides you through the process of creating 
your will. You figure out what a will can and can’t do 
and why your will is a key part of your estate plan. You 
find out about pitfalls you may encounter when writing 
your will, and how to properly execute your will when it’s 
complete. You understand why you must regularly review 
and update your will, and how to make changes. You also 
find out about the probate process and how to avoid will 
contests.

Chapter 7
Writing and Signing a Will
In This Chapter
 Deciding what type of will you need
 Reviewing your assets
 Choosing your heirs and making bequests
 Executing a valid will
Your will is an essential part of your estate plan. No matter what else you 
do to plan your estate, your will serves purposes that no other estate 
planning document can fill. Through your will, you can
 
 Designate who will care for your minor children and their money
 
 Detail your preferences for your funeral and the disposition of your 
body
 
 Plan how your estate will pay your bills
 
 Provide a backup plan in case something is accidentally left out of your 
estate plan or a bequest fails
Most people are able to compose a simple will, which is all some people need. 
This chapter outlines what goes into a will, and how to properly execute your will.
More complex estate plans utilize both a will and trusts. If your estate is 
large, you need to engage in tax planning, or you want to do things that may 
be legally tricky (such as disinheriting an heir), you’ll probably benefit from 
having a lawyer draft your will.
Deciding Whether a Will 
Serves Your Needs
In one sense, asking yourself whether a will serves your needs is an easy 
question. Everybody has needs that can be served by a will, so everybody 
should have a will.

96
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
But what I’m really asking is whether your estate plan can be managed with 
just a will. If you don’t have estate tax concerns, aren’t concerned about pro-
bate or having your will made part of a public court record, and simply want 
your estate to be distributed to your heirs when you die, a simple will may be 
all you need.
 
Until you’re near retirement age, a living trust probably won’t help you, but it 
will cost you time and money to create and update, and it will be more cum-
bersome for you to work with assets that you transfer into the trust. Sure, 
even younger people can suffer a sudden illness or die unexpectedly, but if 
you’re in pretty good health, you can cover your bases pretty well with a will, 
durable power of attorney, and healthcare proxy.
Trusts are most useful in your estate plan when
 
 Your estate may be subject to estate taxes. Presently your estate must 
be worth $2 million or more to pay federal estate taxes.
 
 You want to avoid probate court.
 
Most states have significantly improved the probate process, and smaller 
estates often qualify for simplified probate. It may be cheaper to probate your 
estate instead of creating and funding a trust.
Simplicity often leads you to a will
The fewer assets you have, and the less complicated your plans for the distri-
bution of your estate, the more likely it is that a will is all you need.
Similarly, if you’re married and want to leave most or all of your estate 
to your spouse, you probably don’t need a complicated estate plan. Your 
spouse should automatically inherit your share of jointly owned property, 
and you may not have much left to go through probate.
Do you own real estate in more than one state? The probate court in the state 
where you die doesn’t have authority over real estate located in another 
state or country. To probate out-of-state real property, the administrator of 
your estate will have to start a separate probate action in the state where the 
property is located. You can easily avoid this complication with a living trust. 
(See Chapter 12 for more on this process.)
Do you own your own business? If so, even during your prime working years, 
you should start thinking about business succession. If your business may 
falter or fail without you, you also need to create a plan for your incapac-
ity. During the time it takes for a probate court to appoint somebody to take 
over your business, it may suffer significant losses or become broken beyond 
repair. (Chapter 4 discusses business succession planning.)

97
 Chapter 7: Writing and Signing a Will
 
You can create and fund trusts with your will. You can get the estate tax benefits 
of a bypass trust or restrict when and how your heirs receive their inheri-
tances, by including pour-over provisions in your will to fund an existing trust 
or providing for the creation and funding of an entirely new testamentary trust.
 
If you live in Louisiana, whatever your circumstances, your estate may be 
too complicated to plan by yourself. Your state has forced heirship laws that 
require you to leave bequests to certain heirs and has strict requirements for 
the execution of a valid will. If you reside in Louisiana, I suggest that you hire a 
lawyer to draft your will.
For people in other states, the larger and more complex your estate, the 
more likely it is that you’ll benefit from having a professionally drafted will. If 
you require tax-planning services, want to disinherit an heir, or have children 
from a prior relationship, a lawyer can help you figure out exactly what you 
need to do to plan your estate and help you avoid traps that can seriously 
disrupt your plan for your assets.
For more information on estate planning traps, see Chapter 8. For tips on 
how to find an estate planning lawyer, see Chapter 4.
Assets not covered by a will
As you review your assets, consider whether they’re jointly owned or already 
have a designated beneficiary. If you’re married, many of your assets are 
probably jointly owned with your spouse. Your insurance policies and retire-
ment accounts name a beneficiary.
When joint ownership or a beneficiary designation define who will receive 
property upon your death, it doesn’t matter what you put in your will. 
Whatever your will says, the assets pass according to the title or beneficiary 
designation and never become part of your probate estate. These transfers 
are thus said to occur outside of probate.
The following sections address the different types of assets not covered by a will.
Insurance, annuities, and retirement accounts 
with designated beneficiaries
When you designate a beneficiary for an insurance policy, annuity, or retire-
ment account, the asset is transferred to your beneficiary upon proof of your 
death. These assets are generally still included in your estate for the calcula-
tion of estate tax, but the probate court isn’t involved in the transfer of the 
asset to your beneficiary.
Your heir may receive significant benefits from receiving a retirement 
account outside of probate. (See Chapter 15 for additional information on 
retirement accounts.)

98
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
Insurance can be a very important part of your estate plan, and it may be 
possible for you to keep insurance proceeds out of your taxable estate. If the 
insurance payout will cause your estate to become taxable, see Chapter 16.
Property with a right of survivorship
If you’re married, you and your spouse probably jointly own your home. If 
your deed says that ownership is by the entireties or refers to a right of survi-
vorship, your co-owners should receive your interest in the property without 
going through probate.
The various ways that property may be titled, and how that affects the trans-
fer or inheritance of property, are detailed in Chapter 17.
Joint bank accounts
The money in your joint bank accounts is available for either account holder 
to withdraw, at any time. Unless you set up the account to require the con-
sent of all account holders, your joint account holder doesn’t need your 
permission to withdraw funds. When you die, your interest in the account 
passes to your joint account holders.
 
You need to be careful with joint bank accounts for several reasons:
 
 The IRS will try to count the entire balance of your joint account in your 
taxable estate and will require the joint account holders to prove that 
they contributed money to the account balance.
 
 Your joint account holder can empty your account. There are many sad 
stories where an elderly person added a younger sibling or child to the 
account to “help” pay their bills and manage their assets, only to have 
the “helper” pocket the money.
If you intend to maintain total control over the account until your death, 
you may be better served by adding a transfer-on-death provision to your 
account rather than joint ownership (see the next section).
Transfer-on-death accounts and titles
As an alternative to joint ownership, you can give somebody an interest in 
property or financial accounts that doesn’t take effect until you die. Although 
the asset is included in your estate for gift tax purposes, the transfer-on-death 
provision transfers ownership to your beneficiary upon your death without 
the necessity of probate. You keep total ownership and control of the asset 
during your lifetime.
You need to be careful using this technique. If your family circumstances 
change, your transfer-on-death provision may become outdated, as in the fol-
lowing cases:

99
 Chapter 7: Writing and Signing a Will
 
 If you set up a deed to transfer ownership to your three children upon 
your death and a child dies before you, the property will go to your sur-
viving children unless you included your grandchildren as contingent 
beneficiaries.
 
 If you later have or adopt another child, unless you update the provi-
sion, that child won’t inherit.
 
 If you set up an asset to transfer on death to your spouse, you must 
remember to update that provision after divorce, or your ex-spouse will 
receive the asset.
Exploring the Types of Wills
Wills come in many different types. For the most part, the difference is one 
of complexity. The basic elements of a simple will are also present in a highly 
complex will, but additional provisions have been added.
The statutory will
Most states offer a statutory will, a very simple will that, if properly executed, 
will be accepted by a probate court. Statutory wills are often made available 
as fill-in-the-blanks forms, so they’re pretty easy to complete. You may be 
able to get a form by asking your state representative’s office to provide one, 
and in many states, they’re available for download from the state legislature 
or state courts Web sites.
At the same time, statutory wills are very simple. They can help you imple-
ment a basic estate plan, but aren’t meant to help with tax planning or more 
complicated estates. While unquestionably “better than nothing,” a statutory 
will is most useful if you have a very small estate and desire a very simple 
estate plan.
The handwritten (holographic) will
A holographic will (or in Louisiana, an olographic will) is written entirely 
in your own handwriting and is signed by you, but isn’t witnessed. Most 
states disfavor holographic wills and recognize them only under narrow cir-
cumstances, such as when they’re prepared by a soldier who is engaged in 
combat.
A cousin of the holographic will is the oral will, sometimes called a nuncupa-
tive will, where there is no written document at all. A court will entertain an 

100
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
oral will in a few circumstances — typically only where the person making 
the will faces imminent death, where disinterested witnesses produce a writ-
ten record of the will shortly after the person’s death, and where only small 
amounts of money are involved.
Sometimes you can go through the trouble of writing or articulating a will, 
but you can’t produce a written will that is properly witnessed. Make sure 
that your wishes will be respected by following your state’s formalities for 
the execution of your will. (See Appendix A for state-by-state guidance on 
executing a formal will.)
A will of your own
Your will is more powerful than you may realize. In addition to parceling out 
your estate to your heirs, you can create and fund trusts, implement parts of 
your estate tax avoidance strategy, designate caregivers for your minor chil-
dren, and outline your preferences for your funeral and memorial service.
As a general rule, when you create a will, it’s sensible to
 
 Follow state law formalities for the execution of your will. Otherwise 
your will may be rejected by a probate court.
 
 Whenever possible, keep your estate plan simple. Don’t complicate 
your will unless you’re truly convinced that the added complexity is nec-
essary to your estate plan.
 
You can find will forms that you can customize to your circumstances on the 
CD accompanying this book.
Other wills
When I discuss a simple will, I’m usually talking about a will that appoints an 
administrator, perhaps designates people to care for your minor children, and allo-
cates your estate between your heirs. But you can do a lot more with your will.
 
 Testamentary and pour-over wills: You can create a trust with your will 
or direct your estate to put assets into a trust. (For more on trusts, see 
Part III.)
 
 Joint wills: You can create a joint estate plan with your spouse and may 
also be able to make your joint estate plan legally binding even after 
your death.
 
 Self-proving wills: You can add an affidavit to your will to simplify the 
process of submitting it to probate.

 Chapter 7: Writing and Signing a Will
Testamentary and pour-over wills
When you create a living trust, you traditionally transfer assets into your 
trust during your lifetime. That transfer of assets simplifies probate and 
helps with disability planning.
But what if you never get around to transferring your assets into your trust 
or want to keep ownership in your own name during your lifetime? You can 
use your will to create or fund a trust. How is this done?
 
 A pour-over will funds an existing trust. A pour-over clause may add 
additional funds or assets to your living trust. But you can also execute 
a trust that you have no intention of funding during your lifetime and 
direct assets into the trust from your estate.
 
 A testamentary trust will includes language that creates a trust that 
becomes operative upon your death. You can even make the creation 
of the trust conditional — for example directing inheritances for your 
minor children into a trust, but allowing them to directly receive their 
inheritances if they reach adulthood before you die.
Testamentary trusts can be useful as part of a tax-avoidance strategy. For 
example, if you’re married, you can create a testamentary bypass trust to 
maximize estate tax exemptions for your combined marital estate. Chapter 12 
describes the many trust options.
Joint wills
In simple terms, a joint will is executed by both you and your spouse. When 
the first spouse dies, the surviving spouse inherits the entire estate. 
When the surviving spouse dies, the estate is distributed according to the 
terms of the will.
A joint will is a simple way to provide for your spouse and heirs, but it’s not 
much more complicated for you and your spouse to both execute your own 
separate wills.
If your joint will doesn’t prevent the surviving spouse from changing the will 
after you die, your spouse may change your common estate plan. If you’re 
trying to provide for friends or relatives that your spouse doesn’t care for, or 
for children from a prior marriage, that may be a risk you don’t want to take.
 
If you want to be sure that if you die first, your spouse can’t change your joint 
estate plan, many states permit you to enter into a contract will. You and your 
spouse enter into a joint estate plan.
 
 As long as you remain alive, you and your spouse may change the plan 
or even scrap it.
 
 Upon the death of you or your spouse, the estate plan becomes binding 
and irrevocable.

102
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
For a smaller estate, a contract will may be a sufficient means of ensuring 
that your heirs receive their inheritances, even if your spouse might prefer to 
disinherit them after your death. But a contract will does have disadvantages:
 
 Your spouse may not be able to sell or dispose of assets that are identi-
fied in the joint estate plan. For example, will your spouse be able to sell the 
marital home and move into a condo or apartment? What if your spouse can 
barely afford the house payments, let alone the cost of maintenance?
 
 Your other heirs’ inheritances may be tied up for the life of your spouse, 
which could be 20 or 30 years. Do you want your children to receive 
their inheritances when they’re getting established in their lives, or 
when they’re approaching retirement age?
 
If you’re considering a binding, joint estate plan, you should consider using 
a trust. The bypass trust is powerful estate planning tool that lets you direct 
assets to your heirs while providing lifetimes support for your spouse. You 
can also use trusts to allow your younger spouse to remain in the marital 
home for a period of years following your death, with the home then being 
inherited by your children from a prior marriage. For more discussion of 
estate planning for second marriages, see Chapter 4.
Self-proving wills
It’s unlikely that somebody is going to challenge the validity of your will. 
Most of the time, everybody agrees that the will submitted to the probate 
court is genuine. But if a disagreement occurs, tracking down witnesses to 
your will can be difficult. Your witnesses may have moved, and some may 
even be dead.
A self-proving will includes an affidavit, executed and signed by your witnesses 
in front of a notary public. When the affidavit is properly executed, your will 
may be submitted to probate without any statements from your witnesses.
Elements of a Will
In order to be effective, your will must describe who you are, what assets you 
have, who you want to receive your assets, and how your assets are to be 
divided. Beyond the basic elements, your will appoints a personal representa-
tive to administer your estate and can also appoint caregivers for your minor 
children. It can create or fund trusts to hold and manage your assets after 
your death. Your will can also describe your funeral and burial preferences.
 
Appendix C provides a form to help you assemble the information necessary 
to complete your will. This form is also available on the CD accompanying 
this book.

103
 Chapter 7: Writing and Signing a Will
Who you are
The popular conception is that a will commences with the declaration, “I, 
John Smith, being of sound mind and body. . . .” However, it’s not necessary 
to describe your health. And if you’re not mentally competent, it doesn’t 
make any difference to say you are.
 
All you really need to do is identify yourself sufficiently so that people will 
know that it’s your will.
What are your assets
Part of the estate planning process is figuring out what you own. Your pos-
sessions will typically include
 
 Personal assets:
 
• Cash, savings, and checking accounts
 
• Investments
 
• Home furnishings
 
• Jewelry
 
• Art and antiques
 
• Collectibles
 
• Your wardrobe
 
 Real estate, including your primary residence and any vacation property
 
 Insurance policies and annuities
 
 Retirement plans
If you’re a business owner or are a partner in a small business, your estate 
also includes your interest in the business.
Not all your assets will go through probate. Insurance policies and retirement 
plans probably have a designated beneficiary. Your home may automatically 
go to your spouse as the joint title holder. But you should still consider those 
assets when planning your estate, as they can affect how you distribute your 
other assets. For example, if one of your children is the beneficiary of a life 
insurance policy, you can leave a larger bequest to your other child to bal-
ance out the inheritances.
You should also take inventory of your debts, including mortgages and bank 
loans, credit cards, and car loans.

104
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
 
Your estate will pay off your debts before your heirs receive their inheri-
tances. If some of your property has to be sold to pay your debts, a specific 
bequest of that property will fail, or your estate may not have enough money 
left over to fill all your bequests. For guidance on inventorying your assets and 
debts, see Chapter 3.
Who are your beneficiaries
After you know what you own, you need to figure out who you want to give it 
to. Put together a list of your possible heirs. Be overinclusive. You don’t have 
to leave something to every person on your list.
Here are a few ideas to get you started:
 
 Your family, including
 
• Your spouse
 
• Your children and stepchildren
 
• Your grandchildren and great-grandchildren
 
• Your parents
 
• Your sisters and brothers
 
• Aunts, uncles, and cousins
 
• Nieces and nephews
 
 Your friends
 
 Educational institutions
 
 Charities
You need to also consider the circumstances of your heirs. Young children 
may benefit from having their inheritances left to them in a trust, provid-
ing for their support and payment of educational expenses over a period of 
years. An heir who doesn’t manage money well may benefit from a spend-
thrift trust. An heir who receives public assistance due to a disability may 
benefit from a special needs trust. You can find more discussion on estate 
planning for these special circumstances in Chapters 4 and 5.
What are your bequests
You know what you own. You know who your heirs are. You now need to 
figure out who gets what (and who gets left out).

105
 Chapter 7: Writing and Signing a Will
 
The law limits your ability to disinherit your spouse and sometimes your 
minor children. Chapter 8 discusses the limits on disinheritance.
 
When you’re drafting a will in Louisiana, you operate subject to your state’s 
forced heirship laws. These laws compel you to leave minimum bequests to 
certain heirs, principally your spouse and children, and define very narrow 
grounds under which you may disinherit an heir or provide a lesser bequest 
than the law specifies. These laws make it very difficult for people to plan their 
estates without the assistance of a lawyer.
Avoiding failed bequests
Your bequests may fail in one of two ways:
 
 Your heir may die before you or may decline an inheritance.
 
 You may leave a bequest of property that is no longer part of your estate 
when you die.
The first problem is pretty easy to address. If you have a specific item of 
property that you want to remain in the family, designate an alternate benefi-
ciary. For example, if you leave your grandmother’s engagement ring to your 
eldest daughter, name her younger sister as the alternate beneficiary.
Naming an alternate beneficiary is also important as your bequest to an heir 
who dies before you may pass to that heir’s descendents, rather than staying 
in your estate. If you don’t designate an alternate beneficiary for Grandma’s 
engagement ring, it may end up going to your son-in-law.
If you leave a bequest of a specific asset that is no longer in the estate, your 
bequest failed. This problem can arise with anything that is sold, lost, spent, 
or destroyed, including cars, collections, investments, and cash. For example:
 
 Your will bequeaths “My house at 1212 Cherry Tree Lane” to your son. 
You subsequently sell the house, move, and don’t update your will to 
leave your new home to your son. His gift fails. Your first house is no 
longer in your estate, and your new home doesn’t automatically get sub-
stituted for the old. Although a more generic description, such as simply 
saying “my home,” may prevent the failure of your bequest if you own a 
different home at the time of your death, it won’t help if you no longer 
own a home.
 
 You have an investment account worth $500,000. You leave $100,000 to 
your brother, with the balance to be split between your children. Before 
you die, you suffer an illness that runs up large medical bills. After your 
medical bills and the other debts of your estate are paid, only $80,000 
remains in the account. Part of your brother’s gift fails, as he receives 
only $80,000 of the $100,000 you intended him to receive. But although 
you intended them to each inherit $200,000, your children receive 
nothing from the account.

106
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
Sometimes a gift will fail by accident or oversight. Say that you have two 
children, Jack and Peter. Your will leaves bequests to “My children, Jack and 
Peter.” You later have a third child, Sue, but forget to update your will. Even 
though she’s one of your children, you’ve excluded her from that bequest. 
Note that this omission may not leave her empty-handed and may in fact 
cause her to inherit more than her siblings. (See the discussion of estate 
planning for unknown heirs in Chapter 8.)
With a bit of extra thought, you can help make sure that your bequests 
succeed.
 
 You can use generic descriptions, such as “my personal residence” or 
“my car” so that changes in your assets are less likely to cause a gift 
to fail.
 
 You can gift in percentages (“20 percent of my stock account to my 
brother, and the rest divided equally among my children”) rather than in 
specific dollar figures.
 
 You can give class gifts, “to my children” or “to my grandchildren,” 
rather than naming specific individuals.
Additional suggestions for making sure that your intentions are honored, 
and to minimize the chances that your estate plan will go horribly wrong, are 
found in Chapter 8.
Creating a moral obligation or a binding inheritance
Sometimes you have reasons why you don’t want to leave property directly 
to the intended recipient. Here’s a common example: Perhaps you have a 
child who is disabled and receives public assistance. Rather than creating a 
special needs trust, you may choose to leave that child’s share of your estate 
to another sibling, trusting that your children will take care of each other.
Most of the time, things work out the way you want. Probably 95 percent 
of the time, the heir who holds an inheritance for the benefit of somebody 
else will do exactly what you wanted. The rest of the time, perhaps out of 
personal financial hardship or perhaps out of greed, the person holding the 
money will spend it, and the person they were supposed to look after has no 
legal remedy.
 
Even when things work out, this arrangement can burden a family relation-
ship. The child trusted with the money may come under constant demands 
for more money, perhaps amounts w–ell in excess of what you left, from 
their sibling.
If you want to create a moral obligation on your heirs, you can take some 
comfort in the odds. But be sure that you also consider the burdens and risks 
you may create.

107
 Chapter 7: Writing and Signing a Will
Reference to a tangible personal 
property memorandum
Some states allow you to make reference in your will to an external document 
that lists items of personal property and who inherits them. This memoran-
dum allows you to leave your household furnishings and personal posses-
sions to specific people, change the list to add new items, remove things you 
no longer possess, or change who gets what, without changing your will.
The formal requirements for the memorandum can be very different, depend-
ing upon the laws of your state. Some states are content with a list you sign 
and date, while others require formal witnessing and execution. Not all states 
permit this type of memorandum.
If your state permits and you create a memorandum, make sure that you keep 
it in a secure place known to your personal representative. If it gets lost or 
misplaced, it can’t be followed.
What happens with the residue 
 (if any) of the estate
After all your bequests are made, odds are that something will be left over. 
Items of personal property that weren’t specifically described in your will, 
some of the money that was set aside to pay the expenses of your estate — 
your clothes, a bequest that failed Whatever it is, the leftover items are the 
residue of your estate.
A residuary clause describes how those leftovers are to be distributed to 
your heirs. For example, “The residue of my estate is to be divided equally 
between my children.”
 
If you don’t include a residuary clause, anything left in your estate will be 
distributed according to your state’s laws of intestate succession. Truly, 
including a residuary clause is so easy that you have no excuse not to 
have one.
Payment of debts by the estate
Your estate is obligated by law to pay your debts. Your personal represen-
tative provides notice to your creditors, consistent with the laws of your 
estate, those creditors submit claims for payment, and your estate pays 
those debts found to be valid.

108
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
 
Help your personal representative by leaving, along with your will, a list of 
your debts. That list will make notifying your creditors of your death and their 
obligation to submit claims to your estate so much easier for your personal 
representative.
Most wills include a clause directing your personal representative to 
pay your bills. Some are more demanding, suggesting that your personal 
representative should affirmatively seek out and pay your creditors.
 
A clause relating to your debts can’t reduce your estate’s obligations to pay 
its debts under state law. It can only enlarge the responsibilities of your 
personal administrator. I thus consider this clause to be optional and in most 
cases suggest leaving it out of your will.
Describing your funeral and burial wishes
If you have specific wishes for your funeral and burial, you can describe them 
in your will. Topics you may want to address include
 
 Whether you want to be cremated or buried or have other wishes for 
the disposition of your body.
 
 Where you want to be buried
 
 What type of funeral and memorial service you desire and any specific 
people you want to have invited to your service
 
 Any poems, scripture, songs, quotations, or readings you’d like shared 
at your service
Your estate plan should anticipate the payment of funeral expenses. Funeral 
costs, along with your other bills, are paid before any distributions are made 
to your heirs.
Designating a personal representative
Your personal representative, also called an executor, manages your estate 
in the probate court. This role is important and sometimes difficult, so you 
need to choose somebody who has the necessary interest and qualifications 
to administer your estate. You want somebody who is mature, financially 
responsible, and trustworthy.
You can describe in your will how your personal representative is to be 
compensated. Unless your personal representative is your primary heir, 
I suggest providing for payment.

109
 Chapter 7: Writing and Signing a Will
You should also designate an alternate personal representative, in case your 
first choice is unable or unwilling to serve. If you don’t choose a personal 
representative or don’t have an available alternate when your first choice 
is unavailable, the probate court will appoint somebody to administer 
your estate.
For more information on selecting a personal representative, see Chapter 4.
Designating a guardian 
for any minor children
If you’re providing for your minor children, you should designate a person 
you want to care for your children if you die. You can separate physical care 
from finances, designating one person to take physical care of your children 
and another person to handle their money.
You’ll also want to designate successor caregivers, just in case your first 
choice is unable to fulfill their duties. Chapter 5 offers a lot of suggestions 
on how to select caregivers for your children and provide for their care 
and support.
Your signature
After you finish drafting your will, you must sign and date it. Some states 
require that you sign your will in front of your witnesses. Others allow you to 
sign it at an earlier time, as long as you inform your witnesses that it’s your 
signature and acknowledge that the document is your last will and testament.
Executing a Valid Will
The specific requirements for executing a will are different in each state. 
Appendix A summarizes state laws.
Every state requires your will to be witnessed by two legally competent 
individuals. Many states limit the inheritance that may be received by a 
witness to your will, so use witnesses who aren’t also your heirs. See 
Appendix A for more information on state laws governing who may, and 
who may not, witness your will.

110
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
Choosing the right witnesses
If someone challenges your will, your witnesses may be crucial to estab-
lishing the authenticity of your will and signature. What does that mean? It 
means that you want your witnesses to be
 
 Credible
 
 Available
 
 Disinterested
Disinterested doesn’t mean uninterested. It means that they don’t stand to 
profit from their actions. If one of your heirs contests your will and it was wit-
nessed by another heir, a court may be skeptical of your witness’s testimony. 
Also, as a check on self-interested testimony, most states limit the amount 
you can leave to an heir who serves as a witness. In short, pick witnesses 
who are not heirs.
 
You may also want to pick witnesses who are younger than you are, and 
who have relatively stable addresses. Although some states allow you to use 
minors as witnesses as long as they’re competent to testify in court, most 
states don’t. You’re best served by choosing witnesses who are legal adults.
Signing and executing your will
Although the specific requirements for execution are different from state to 
state, I suggest taking a conservative approach to executing your will. If you 
want to know the minimum requirements for your state, consult Appendix A. 
If you want to go a bit overboard:
 
 Consider using three witnesses instead of two and make sure that 
they’re all legal adults.
 
 Don’t use your heirs as witnesses.
 
 Have a signing ceremony where all your witnesses see you sign your will 
and sign on as witnesses in front of you and each other and your notary.
 
 At your signing ceremony, complete a self-proving affidavit before a 
notary.
 
If you go the extra mile, even if you significantly exceed what your state 
demands of you, you reduce the chances that a challenge will be made to the 
validity of your will.

 Dying at the same time as your spouse
 Failing to update your will

T
his chapter covers some of the trickier aspects of estate planning, includ-
ing disinheriting an heir, addressing possible unknown heirs, what a will 
should never say, the potential disaster in not keeping a will current, the 
potential impact of state laws about inheritances and wills, and what to do if 
you lose your will.
Identifying Common Land Mines
As you prepare your estate plan, you should be aware of the following 
pitfalls:
 
 Disinheriting an heir is more difficult than you think.
 
 Your bequests may conflict with state law (and state law usually wins).
 
 You should resist the temptation to share harsh words and feelings.
 
 Odd things may happen if you die at the same time as your spouse and 
haven’t provided for that possibility.
 
One of the biggest errors you can make is assuming that once you have writ-
ten your will, your job is done. You must periodically review and update your 
will. If you don’t, the distribution of your estate may be very different from 
what you expect.

112
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
Disinheriting heirs, known and unknown
As a general rule, you can decide how your estate will be distributed. You can 
disinherit whomever you choose. You can leave your other heirs as much or 
as little as you want.
Yet the process of disinheriting an heir can be trickier than you may think. 
State law may prevent you from fully disinheriting a spouse or child. Mistakes 
in your will may permit your disinherited child to inherit despite your clear 
wishes.
When you disinherit an heir, be clear in your language. You don’t need to 
explain your decision. Examples of clear statements disinheriting an heir 
include
 
 “For reasons known to him, I leave nothing to my son, George.”
 
 “I disinherit my daughter, Rebecca.”
You may have heard that you should leave a nominal bequest, such as $1, 
to your disinherited heir. You don’t have to follow that advice, and doing so 
creates unnecessary work for your personal representative who has to track 
down and provide the $1 check to your disinherited heir.
 
What if the heir you disinherit is inclined to contest your estate? Even if your 
disinheritance is upheld by a court, your estate will be tied up in litigation and 
incur legal fees. You may want to leave a more substantial bequest, coupled 
with a no-contest clause (a clause disinheriting anybody who contests your 
will). An heir given the choice of a $20,000 inheritance or initiating a will con-
test and possibly walking away with nothing may choose to take the check.
 
A disinheritance clause governs only your heir’s right to inherit under the 
terms of your will itself, and not any legal right of inheritance under state law. 
Whatever you provide in your will, your heir will be eligible to inherit any 
portion of your estate that is distributed under intestate succession laws. 
To fully disinherit an heir, you must include a residuary clause in your will, 
directing the distribution of the balance of your estate after all specific 
bequests have been made.
Limitations on disinheritance
In community property states, your spouse is entitled to half the marital 
estate under community property laws. You’re free to leave your half of the 
estate to whomever you choose. However, common law states allow your 
spouse to opt against the will, choosing a statutorily defined inheritance. If 
you disinherit your spouse, expect that your spouse will choose that option.

113
 Chapter 8: Navigating the Land Mines
You may be able to limit your spouse’s statutory inheritance rights through 
a prenuptial agreement. For more on prenuptial agreements, see the section 
“Handling spousal rights and community property,” later in this chapter.
Many states also limit your ability to disinherit your dependent children. 
Their principal goal is to prevent your children from becoming dependent 
upon public assistance.
 
Louisiana has a unique set of laws known as forced heirship laws, which 
restrict your ability to disinherit your children and descendents. If you intend 
to disinherit a legal heir in Louisiana, in order to be sure that your disin-
heritance is legal and effective, you should get help from an estate planning 
lawyer.
Disinheriting or providing for unknown heirs
If you’re concerned that an heir may appear and make a claim for your estate, 
be sure to address that in your will. Imagine, for example, that you were a 
bit wild in your younger days and are concerned that a child you don’t even 
know about might appear to make a claim against your estate. What can 
you include in your will to protect your intended heirs? An extremely broad 
clause can read
I intentionally and with full knowledge of the consequences do not provide 
in my will or living trust for any of my children not identified within my will 
and trust, including children conceived, born, or adopted by me after the 
execution of my will, and intend that this disinheritance specifically defeat 
the application of any statutory heirship interest.
Is disinheritance the right choice?
Your children don’t talk to you. Your son can’t 
hold a job. Your daughter is a drug addict. You 
don’t want them to get any of your money. So 
you should disinherit them, right?
Perhaps not.
Money is a powerful motivator. If you discuss 
your estate plan with your children and warn 
them that you intend to disinherit them, you 
may inspire significant improvement in their 
conduct. You can argue that you don’t want to 
coerce your children, but is the alternative truly 
better? And what starts out as coercion can 
grow in to something else.
Your son may not like to hear you say that unless 
he gets a steady job and settles down, he won’t 
get a penny of your estate. But five years later, 
he may be married and employed. The children 
who never call you may suddenly be making 
regular visits and phone calls.
I’m not suggesting that you be a sucker. You 
can wait to see whether their efforts are sin-
cere. But you may find that after your children 
know your grievances and have an opportunity 
to change, your reasons for disinheritance 
evaporate.

114
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
With a clause like this one, you may provide specific bequests to your known 
children, but shut the door to claims by others. Here’s a simpler clause:
Except as otherwise provided herein and in my living trust, I have 
intentionally omitted to provide for any of my heirs, children, or persons 
claiming to be my heirs, whether or not known to me.
 
These clauses are broad enough to disinherit children known to you, including 
children born or adopted after your will is executed, so be extremely careful 
in using this type of clause.
You can soften the effect for after-born or adopted children:
Except as otherwise provided herein and in my living trust, I have 
intentionally omitted to provide for any persons born and living as of the 
date of this will who claim to be my heirs, including my children and legal 
heirs, or whether or not known to me.
Be clear when providing for or disinheriting 
illegitimate children
Jim was a wealthy widower who had been 
married for more than 50 years. But during the 
early years of his marriage, he had an affair. His 
lover had a child, Elizabeth, whom “everybody” 
believed to be Jim’s daughter. Jim treated 
Elizabeth very well during his lifetime, but never 
formally acknowledged her as his daughter. 
Elizabeth experienced some financial problems 
shortly before Jim’s death, and he let her stay 
rent-free in an apartment building he owned. In 
his will, he left her a life estate in the apartment, 
giving her a permanent, rent-free place to live.
After Jim died, Elizabeth challenged his will 
claiming that she was an “omitted child.” She 
sought DNA testing to prove paternity. Even 
though she inherited under the will, she claimed 
that the inheritance was insubstantial in value 
and wasn’t in the nature of a parent-child 
bequest. She argued that Jim’s other children 
received much larger gifts.
The probate court allowed DNA testing, and 
Elizabeth was found to be Jim’s biological 
daughter. After a hearing, the probate court 
held that the life estate was a substantial gift, 
and that Elizabeth hadn’t been omitted from 
Jim’s will. But then the court reversed its ruling 
and allowed Elizabeth to seek a larger share of 
Jim’s estate. Faced with an uncertain outcome 
and the possibility of an expensive, drawn-out 
lawsuit and appeal, Jim’s other heirs agreed 
to settle Elizabeth’s claim. Elizabeth not only 
inherited her apartment, but also received a 
six-figure check.
I suspect that if the case were litigated, the 
courts would have concluded that the probate 
court was right the first time: Jim’s bequest 
to Elizabeth was substantial, and she wasn’t 
an omitted child. I also understand why Jim’s 
other children chose to settle her claim so that 
they could avoid legal fees, receive their inheri-
tances, and move on with their lives.
Jim could have avoided this problem either by 
expressly disinheriting any illegitimate children 
or by stating that his bequest was made with 
the knowledge that Elizabeth might be his bio-
logical daughter.

 Chapter 8: Navigating the Land Mines
If you provide your children with a class gift (“I leave my children the resi-
due of my estate” or “I leave my children 60 percent of my estate”), while an 
unknown child’s claim will reduce the amount inherited by your known 
children, all your children will inherit equally. You can also provide a gift 
for your known children and a different, conditional bequest or class gift for 
children who are born, adopted, or discovered after you execute your will.
You probably heard about the battle over the estate of Anna Nicole Smith, 
with numerous men claiming to be the father of her young daughter, her 
sole heir. But did you know that her will disinherited her daughter? Ms. Smith 
left her entire estate to her son, with a broad disinheritance clause that 
excluded after-born children from inheriting. She never updated her will. 
Tragically, three days after her daughter was born, Ms. Smith’s son died. 
He had no wife or children, so Ms. Smith’s bequest to him lapsed. Ms. 
Smith hadn’t named a contingent beneficiary, so when her gift lapsed, the 
bequest went to her legal heir, her daughter. Ms. Smith almost certainly 
would have wanted this result, but she was saved her from her serious 
estate planning mistakes by nothing more than dumb luck.
 
Your best option is to provide as you see fit for any possible illegitimate chil-
dren or unknown heirs and update your will if your family situation changes.
 
Don’t accidentally disinherit your children and create a context where 
they may be able to make claims against your estate. Make sure that your 
will provides for your children, even if in the alternative. (“I leave my 
estate to my spouse or, if she dies before me, to my children.”)
Avoiding invalidating part 
or all of your will
State laws are likely to affect your will in two contexts. First, they may 
require that you leave a substantial share of your estate to your spouse 
and possibly also provide for the support of your minor children. Second, 
conditions you impose on your heirs may conflict with public policy and 
be ignored by a court.
If you’re careful, you can keep your estate plan within the confines of 
state law.
Handling spousal rights and community property
States take two general approaches to marital property:
 
 In a community property state, although you continue to own the prop-
erty you bring into your marriage, most assets acquired during the mar-
riage belong equally to you and your spouse. Gifts and inheritances you 
receive during marriage are your separate property, but if you put that 
money into a joint bank account, you risk that it will be treated as 
community property.

116
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
 
 In a common law state, you continue to own and accumulate separate 
property during your marriage, but if you divorce, your spouse can 
make an equitable claim for a share of your property.
In a community property state, your spouse already owns half of the marital 
estate. You can’t use your will to reduce that share or take it away, but you’re 
free to distribute your separate property and your own half of the marital 
estate as you want.
In a common law state, the law prevents you from disinheriting your spouse. 
In practical terms, if you leave your spouse less than approximately half of 
your estate, your spouse can make a claim for a larger share.
In many states, you and your spouse can avoid the effects of state law by 
entering into a contract redefining how your assets will be distributed:
 
 A prenuptial agreement, also known as a premarital agreement or 
prenup, defines how you and your spouse own assets you bring into 
your marriage or acquire during your marriage and how your estate will 
be divided if you divorce.
 
 A postnuptial agreement has the same effect as a prenuptial agreement, 
but is executed after you’re married.
 
 You can enter into joint wills or trusts to create a contractually binding 
estate plan. For more on contract wills, see Chapter 7.
Be careful about entering into a marital agreement, before or after marriage. 
Not all states permit them, and some may permit one but not the other or 
impose different criteria for when they’re enforceable. If your prenuptial 
agreement is deemed unfair or incomplete or that your spouse didn’t under-
stand its terms, a court may refuse to enforce it. If you intend to use a marital 
agreement as part of your estate plan, you and your spouse should each 
consult separate, independent lawyers in association with the drafting and 
execution of the agreement.
 
Your real estate remains subject to the laws of the state where it’s located. 
A move to a different state is most likely to affect you if you and your spouse 
own real estate in a community property state and then move to a common 
law state. For a list of community property states and more information on 
how community property laws may affect you, see Chapter 3.
 
If you move to another state, you should review your will under the laws of 
your new state, particularly if you’re moving to
 
 A common law state from a community property state
 
 A community property state from a common law state
 
 Or from Louisiana

117
 Chapter 8: Navigating the Land Mines
Providing for your dependents
Some states prohibit you from disinheriting your dependent children if your 
estate has sufficient assets to provide for their support. Massachusetts law, 
for example, provides that death doesn’t extinguish a parent’s duty to sup-
port a minor child. Florida’s state constitution protects your spouse’s right to 
inherit your house if you have a minor child.
These restrictions aren’t universal, and some states do permit disinheritance 
of minor children. You probably intend to provide for your children, but if 
you don’t, you should verify your state’s laws.
Controlling your heirs from beyond the grave
You may want to use your will to force self-improvement upon your slothful 
child or finally get your daughter to divorce your annoying son-in-law. What 
if you make their inheritance conditional upon their taking specific actions? 
Your son inherits only if he is up by 7 a.m. every morning and works a full-
time job. Your daughter inherits only if she gets a divorce.
As you probably suspected, it’s not that easy. Courts won’t enforce condi-
tions on bequests that are considered to be against public policy or that 
are too onerous to monitor. A condition that requires your beneficiaries to 
endanger themselves or others, or commit a crime also won’t be enforced.
If your conditions are reasonable but your heir doesn’t want to fulfill the 
condition, your heir may decline your gift. You should designate an alternate 
beneficiary to receive your bequest in the event that the condition isn’t met 
or your gift is declined. If you don’t, your condition may be disregarded such 
that your heir inherits even if the condition is not met.
The following sections cover some restraints that don’t fly with courts.
Marriage
Total restraints on marriage won’t be upheld. (“I leave $100,000 to Becky if 
she never marries.”) However, a provision of support ending upon marriage 
is permitted. (“I leave Becky an income of $10,000 per year so long as she 
remains unmarried.”)
Some states forbid total restraints on second marriage, while others allow 
such restraints. (“I leave my widow an income of $20,000 per year, so long as 
she doesn’t remarry.”)
A partial restraint on marriage may be upheld if it’s deemed reasonable. 
Reasonableness is a subjective standard, so the outcome can be unpredict-
able. As a general rule, a condition is likely to be held unreasonable if it pre-
vents marriage under most or all foreseeable circumstances. Here are some 
examples of what will and won’t fly:

118
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
 
 A condition requiring that your niece not marry before the age of 24 may 
be deemed reasonable, while a condition that she wait until the age of 55 
will likely be deemed unreasonable.
 
 A court will probably reject a condition that your nephew not marry a 
woman who is more than four feet tall.
 
 Most courts will uphold a condition requiring that your beneficiary 
marry within your religious faith.
Religion
A restraint on religion may be permissible. Religion-based restraints on mar-
riage are often upheld. Other religious conditions are also permitted. (“I leave 
$100,000 to Joe if he attends morning Mass every Sunday, unless prevented 
by illness or while on vacation in foreign lands, for the next five years.”)
However, a restraint that creates a religious conflict between parent and 
child won’t be upheld. A clause providing “I leave my daughter, Jillian, 
$100,000, provided she raises her child in the Methodist Church” would likely 
be upheld if Jillian is a Methodist, but not if she is Jewish.
Conduct
Conditions meant to improve behavior, such as requiring abstention from 
unlawful drugs or alcohol or that your heir stop gambling, will generally be 
upheld. But you must be clear in your meaning, or the condition may fail. 
(How would a court understand the meaning of your provision, “I leave 
$50,000 to Alex, provided he lives a clean and virtuous life.”)
Also, you should describe how performance will be monitored, keeping in 
mind the cost and burden to your estate. If you don’t designate a person to 
monitor compliance of your otherwise reasonable condition, the probate 
court will appoint somebody to monitor compliance, and your estate will pay 
the bill. And the longer your condition remains in effect, the more costly it is 
to monitor compliance.
Keeping a problem with one clause from affecting the rest of your will
You can include within your will a severability clause that provides, in 
the event that any portion of your will is found to be unenforceable, the 
remainder of your will remains in full force and effect.
Without a severability clause, a mistake in your will may cause your entire 
will to be disregarded by the probate court. If you include a severability 
clause, the probate court should ignore the invalid provision but uphold 
the rest of your will.

119
 Chapter 8: Navigating the Land Mines
Lashing out from beyond
Most wills are diligent and methodical in their language. They’re not very 
interesting to read, but they get the job done. But that’s not always the case. 
Some wills include a parting shot at somebody the testator doesn’t like. This 
approach is risky for various reasons:
 
 You may trigger a defamation (testamentary libel) lawsuit against your 
estate.
 
 You give ammunition to anybody who contests your will, as they may 
characterize your angry words as evidence of mental instability.
 
 You may harm your legacy. Your parting shot may overshadow the 
memories you want people to hold.
 
 Your target may never hear your words. Also, although the formal read-
ing of the will is a hallmark of Hollywood movies, it’s not required and is 
rarely done.
 
 Your comments may backfire and result in inheritance by the subject of 
your attack.
How could defamatory statements lead to inheritance? By indicating that you 
omitted the target of your statements from your will by mistake. Consider the 
following examples:
 
 “I was going to give my best friend, Jake, $1 million, but he’s a shameless 
gigolo who slept with my wife.”
 
 “I give each of my grandchildren $50,000, except for Sally who is a 
criminal and a drug addict.”
In either case, you risk that Jake or Sally will argue to the probate court that 
you had testamentary intent and disinherited them by mistake. Jake will 
argue that he’s not a gigolo, and your wife may testify that no affair occurred. 
Sally may establish that she has no criminal record and testify that she isn’t 
addicted to drugs. Even though you never actually intended to give Jake a 
penny and would have disinherited Sally anyway, a court may grant them an 
inheritance.
 
If you want to disinherit an heir, keep your language short and to the point. 
You don’t need to offer lengthy explanations or apologies.
Handling simultaneous death of spouses
Although it’s unlikely to happen, you and your spouse may suffer a common 
catastrophe. A serious car accident can result in both of you dying at the 
same time, or within days of each other.

120
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
In the event of simultaneous death, unless you provide otherwise in your will, 
most states have laws that will distribute your estates as if each of you sur-
vived the other.
These laws often treat deaths as simultaneous based upon the common 
cause, even when one spouse survives the other by days or, in some 
cases, months.
You can define in your will what constitutes simultaneous death. For example, 
you can provide that deaths are simultaneous if your spouse died within 30 
days of you. The period of time you define should be less than six months, 
as beyond that timeframe your gift to your spouse may lose its tax-exempt 
status.
You and your spouse almost certainly own joint property. When you die, 
your joint property goes to your spouse. But if you’re both treated as a 
surviving spouse, automatic inheritance of joint property can’t occur, and 
probate litigation becomes necessary.
 
For larger estates, simultaneous death may significantly increase estate 
tax. When you die, your bequest to your spouse passes free of estate tax. 
As a presumed surviving spouse, you can’t take advantage of that exemption. 
The easiest solution is to include within your will a provision that, in the 
event of simultaneous death, the wealthier spouse is assumed to have 
died first.
But what about your children from your first marriage? If your estate plan 
presumes that your spouse survives you, your assets go into your spouse’s 
estate and may go only to your spouse’s children. As the wealthier spouse, 
you can
 
 Accept the increase in estate taxes and designate your children as the 
alternate beneficiaries of part or all of your estate.
 
 Create an estate plan that uses a bypass trust to maximize estate 
tax benefits for your estate, while protecting your children’s inheri-
tance. (See the discussion of estate planning for second families in 
Chapter 4.)
 
You’ve probably designated your spouse as the beneficiary of your life insur-
ance and retirement and financial accounts. If you and your spouse die at the 
same time, unless you have named an alternate beneficiary, the proceeds 
of your insurance and accounts will go into your probate estate. To prevent 
that event, be sure to designate alternate beneficiaries for those policies and 
accounts.

121
 Chapter 8: Navigating the Land Mines
Realizing Why You Must 
Update Your Will
Your will is a snapshot of your estate and your plan for its distribution, at 
a particular point in time. The most obvious reasons to update your will 
involve changes to your family, particularly marriage, divorce, birth or adop-
tion of a child, or the death of an heir. Yet you have much more to consider.
Your goals and wishes 
may change over time
As time passes, you may be surprised at the twists life throws at you:
 
 You disinherited your ungrateful daughter or your drug-addicted son. 
You have renewed your relationship with your daughter, and your son 
just celebrated ten years of sobriety. Do you still want to leave them out 
of your will?
 
 Your will provides for your estate to be divided equally among your 
children, but your wealth grows considerably. Do you want to give part 
of your estate to charity? Do you need a better tax-avoidance strategy?
 
 After you write your will, you adopt a young child. Your older children 
have graduated from college and have established careers. Do you 
want to make a special provision for your youngest child’s education?
 
 You leave money to your grandchildren to provide for their college 
education. After the youngest graduates from college, do you still want 
to provide that money?
 
 Your son is caught embezzling from his employer and is sent to 
prison. Will your bequest end up reimbursing the state for the cost 
of his incarceration?
 
 Your daughter’s business has failed, and she is deep in debt. Will your 
bequest go to her, or will her creditors end up with the money?
Your periodic review of your will allows you to identify aspects of your estate 
plan that are no longer consistent with your wishes or your original goals.
Your assets may change over time
Over the course of time, your estate will change:

122
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
 
 You will acquire new assets.
 
 Your assets will change in value.
 
 You may sell an asset or give it away, or it may be lost or destroyed.
If you don’t update your estate plan, the distribution of your assets may turn 
out very differently than you intend. For example:
 
 You own two office buildings, each worth $250,000, and leave one to 
each of your children. One building shoots up in value while the other, 
located in a less desirable area, doesn’t.
 
 You leave your $50,000 stamp collection to your son and your $50,000 
Hummel figurine collection to your daughter. Your stamp collection is 
destroyed in a fire.
 
 When you write your will, you have $100,000 of eBay stock and $100,000 
of Pets.com stock. You give the eBay stock to your daughter and the 
Pets.com stock to your son. The eBay stock is worth millions, while Pets.
com stock is worthless.
Assume that the value of your estate is $600,000. Your home is worth 
$300,000, and you have $300,000 in other assets. You provide in your will, 
“I leave my home to my daughter, Jane, and the remainder of my estate to 
my son, Louis.” Now consider these scenarios:
 
 Your salary is raised, and you’re fortunate in your investments. When 
you die, your home has appreciated to $600,000 in value, but your other 
assets are worth $2 million.
 
 You sell your home and move into a much more expensive home, 
applying much of your savings to the down payment. When you die, 
your home is worth $800,000 and your savings are $50,000.
 
 You sell your home and rent an apartment in an assisted-living 
community. When you die you have no home, but have $1,000,000 in 
other assets.
Although you intend equal inheritances, your children’s actual inheritances 
are highly unequal.
You may want to provide for your brother as well as your children. Based 
upon the $600,000 value of your estate, you provide, “I leave my brother, 
Hamilton, $100,000, with the residue of my estate to be divided equally 
between my children.” Unfortunately, you die after a long illness, and your 
assets are used to pay for your medical and nursing home care. Your remain-
ing estate is $150,000. The first $100,000 goes to your brother, and each of 
your children receives $25,000, a tenth of what you intended.

123
 Chapter 8: Navigating the Land Mines
 
You can partially avoid this problem by using percentages instead of dollar 
figures. If you write, “I leave my brother, Hamilton, 16 percent of my estate, 
with the residue of my estate to be divided equally among my children,” your 
brother will inherit $24,000 of your reduced estate, and your children will 
each receive $63,000.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, you can only prevent this type 
of inequity by periodically reviewing and updating your estate plan.
Family changes may invalidate your will
If you’ve left your entire estate to your spouse, your divorce will invalidate 
your will. This is good news, right? It is in part. You probably don’t want your 
ex-spouse to inherit your estate. But don’t forget: If you don’t execute a new 
will, the probate court will distribute your estate according to your state’s 
intestate succession laws as if you have no will.
What if you haven’t left your entire estate to your spouse? Divorce still 
invalidates your bequests to your ex-spouse. As for the rest of your will:
 
 Your other bequests aren’t affected. Provisions you made for your 
ex-spouse’s children remain valid.
 
 The portions of your estate that you left to your spouse will be 
distributed under your state’s laws of intestate succession.
The only way to be sure that your wishes are followed is to execute a 
new will.
Family changes may dramatically alter 
who inherits under your will
Beyond divorce, other changes to your family unit can significantly affect 
inheritance under your will. Your bequests are most likely to be affected if, 
after executing your will:
 
 You marry or remarry.
 
 You have a child or adopt a child.
 
 One of your heirs dies.
If you marry after you execute your will, when you die, your spouse will 
inherit an amount determined by state law, most likely at least half of your 
estate, and perhaps your entire estate.

124
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
If you add a child to your family but don’t update your will to provide for the 
child, your child can ask that the probate court declare that the omission 
was accidental. If the court agrees that your child was accidentally omitted 
from your will, the court will grant your child and inheritance under your 
state’s intestate succession laws.
For a dramatic example of what this ruling can mean, consider the estate of 
Barron Hilton. Pretend for this example that his estate plan is embodied in 
a will. With $2.3 billion in assets, Mr. Hilton has announced his intention to 
leave 97 percent of his estate to charity, dividing approximately $69 million 
among his other heirs. If he wrote his will before the birth of his last child, a 
typical intestate succession law would give half of his estate to his spouse, 
dividing the balance between his surviving children. With eight children, 
the omitted child’s intestate share is roughly $140 million. That’s more than 
twice the combined inheritance of all other family members.
Now imagine a more typical scenario. George Smith has a $1.5 million estate. 
He leaves his wife half of his estate, leaves each of his four children $100,000, 
and divides the rest of his estate among other relatives and charities. Prior 
to his unexpected death, he and his wife have a fifth child. Under a typical 
intestate succession law, George’s wife receives half of his estate, and each 
child is entitled to an equal share of the remainder. The omitted child could 
thus inherit $150,000, substantially more than any other sibling. But worse, 
George’s estate didn’t get any larger. That $150,000 has to come out of the 
money he had intended to leave to other heirs.
 
You can partially prevent these outcomes by making class gifts rather than 
specific bequests. State laws normally only regard your child as having been 
omitted if the child is “not named or provided for” in your will. By naming 
your children as a class, you provide for all of your children.
Thus, if George leaves $400,000 “to be divided equally among my children,” 
each child inherits an equal $80,000. Yet this division may not be George’s 
intention. He may prefer that all his children inherit $100,000, and that the 
money come out of his other bequests. Unless he updates his will, he won’t 
get to make that choice.
The death of an heir may also disrupt your estate plan. If the beneficiary 
you name in your will dies before receiving your bequest, the bequest is 
deemed a lapsed gift and is disregarded in the distribution of your estate. 
In simple terms:
 
 If your will provides for an alternate heir, a lapse simply shifts the 
bequest to the alternate heir. (“I leave my car to my brother, Joe, but if 
he predeceases me to my cousin, Emily.”)

125
 Chapter 8: Navigating the Land Mines
 
 If your will doesn’t provide for an alternate heir, but has a residuary 
clause, the lapsed gift is distributed pursuant to the residuary clause.
 
 If your will has neither an alternate heir nor a residuary clause, or the 
residuary gift lapses, your lapsed gift is distributed under the laws of 
intestate succession as if you had no will.
But that’s the beginning of the story, not the end. Most states have anti-lapse 
statutes that attempt to designate a substitute heir. For example, if you name 
your brother as your heir and he dies before you, a typical anti-lapse statute 
makes his children the beneficiaries of your bequest. Most anti-lapse statutes 
also apply to class gifts, such that if you name “my brothers” as your heirs, 
the children of a brother who dies before you will take his share.
But anti-lapse statutes won’t fix every lapse:
 
 Anti-lapse statutes apply only to pass lapsed gifts to your legal heirs 
(those who would inherit if you died without a will).
 
 Anti-lapse statutes may distribute your estate in a manner you would 
consider unfair.
If you don’t want anti-lapse statutes to apply to your bequests, when draft-
ing your will, you should make your intentions explicit. In some states “mere 
words of survival” (such as, “if they survive me” or “my surviving children”) 
do not prevent the application of an anti-lapse statute unless your will further 
demonstrates your intention to override the anti-lapse statute.
By way of example, imagine that you have three siblings, a brother and 
two sisters. You have no children. Your brother, Horton, dies before you 
write your will. You provide, “I leave $200,000 to be divided equally between 
my surviving siblings, Sarah and Jessica.” Both Sarah and Jessica die before 
you do.
 
 Horton’s child argues that your use of the word “surviving” creates a 
condition, and that the entire gift has lapsed as you have no surviving 
siblings.
 
 Sarah’s four children argue that your bequest was a class gift to your 
surviving siblings and, as Jessica died first, Sarah would have inherited 
the entire bequest as the last surviving member of the class. They thus 
argue that the $200,000 should be divided between them.
 
 Jessica’s child argues that the bequest wasn’t conditional upon your 
sisters surviving you, but merely described that you had two surviving 
siblings at the time you wrote your will. She argues that the anti-lapse 
statute should result in her receiving $100,000, with the remaining 
$100,000 divided between Sarah’s children.

126
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
The odds are pretty good that a court will side with Jessica. Your state’s 
anti-lapse statute probably applies to class gifts and may compel the court to 
disregard the word “surviving.” Even if not compelled to do so, the court may 
agree with Jessica’s child that the language was not intended as a condition. 
Thus, of your six nieces and nephews, the likely outcome is that one inherits 
$100,000, four inherit $25,000, and one gets nothing.
 
The best way to prevent this event is to update your will. If you want, you can 
also provide in your will that you don’t want anti-lapse laws to be applied to 
your bequests. If you do, you should be explicit that you don’t want anti-lapse 
statutes to apply to lapsed or failed gifts. Without your clear expression, the 
probate court will apply those laws.
Knowing What to Do If 
You Lose Your Will
If you store your will in a suitable location, you shouldn’t lose it. (See 
Chapter 2 for more information on storing your will.) But, as they say, to err 
is human. If you’ve lost your will, take these steps:
 
1. Draft a new will. If you can track down a copy of your will, you can use 
it as a basis to redraft and update your will. For the sake of clarity, 
include a clause in your new will that explicitly revokes any prior wills.
 
2. Notify your executor and your heirs of the new will. If two valid wills 
are submitted to a probate court, the court will normally follow the more 
recent will. But if your heirs don’t know about the new will, they may 
find and submit only the earlier will.
 
3. If you’ve distributed any copies of your old will to other people, 
collect those copies and, if you choose, distribute copies of the 
new will.
If you later find the will you lost, make sure that you revoke it, whether 
by physically destroying it or by marking each page of the will as void. 
Chapter 9 discusses revocation of a will in more detail.

Chapter 9
When You Already Have a Will
In This Chapter
 Reviewing your will
 Reacting to changes in your life circumstances
 Rethinking your bequests
 Changing your will
You completed your will, executed it, and breathed a sigh of relief. You 
have every right to congratulate yourself and to take a break from 
thinking about your estate plan. But keep it in the back of your mind that 
your work isn’t over. You must periodically review your will and update it to 
reflect changes in your life and your wishes.
Under some circumstances, if you fail to do so, changes in your life may 
invalidate part or all of your will. In most circumstances, the more time 
that passes from the execution of your will, the less likely it is that the dis-
tribution of your estate will be consistent with your intentions when you 
drafted it.
So when should you review your will? How do you make changes? What if 
you want to revoke your will? This chapter contains those answers.
Reviewing and Updating Your Will
In life, change is inevitable. After you execute your will:
 
 Your family will change, whether by death, marriage, divorce, separa-
tion, childbirth, or adoption.
 
 You will acquire new assets and get rid of some old ones.
 
 You may want to increase, decrease, or eliminate bequests to friends, 
former friends, and charities.
 
 You may reconsider your choice of personal administrator or guardian 
for your minor children.

128
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
 
 Changes in inheritance laws or estate taxes may affect your will, 
frustrating your intentions or invalidating some of your bequests.
Any of these changes may significantly alter your estate plan. Not only may 
your wishes change, the law may create rights for a new spouse or child that 
will alter the distribution of your estate. To be sure that your wishes are fol-
lowed, you must update your will.
 
You’ve probably heard that you should review your will every three or four 
years. I suggest an annual review on a specific date, perhaps the day you 
change the batteries in your smoke detectors. You do that every year, right? 
(See how easy it is to have something you know you should do for the good of 
yourself and your family, but let it slide?)
Changes in your family circumstances
Any major change in your family, including marriage, divorce, childbirth, 
adoption, and death, can disrupt the most careful estate plan.
 
If you move to another state, review your estate plan to make sure that it’s 
consistent with the laws of your new home state. This advice is particularly 
true if you’re married and are moving between a common law state and a com-
munity property state. (For more discussion of community property laws, see 
Chapter 17.)
Divorce or separation
If you divorce, in most states, the portions of your will providing for your 
spouse become invalid. If you’re in one of those states, that law saves you the 
worry that your spouse will inherit from your estate, but it’s not the end of 
the story:
 
 Although the bequests you made to your spouse will lapse, they’ll be 
distributed under the residuary clause of your will (the clause distribut-
ing anything left over after your specific bequests are made) or your 
state’s laws of intestate succession (the laws governing how your estate 
is distributed if you don’t have a will).
 
 If you remarry your ex-spouse and haven’t revoked your will, the provi-
sions for your spouse will usually again become valid.
Some states will invalidate your entire will if you divorce. So update your will 
and write your ex-spouse out of the picture in the manner you choose.
 
Separation has no effect on your bequests, nor does it diminish your spouse’s 
ability to choose a greater inheritance as allowed by state law.

129
 Chapter 9: When You Already Have a Will
Although some states offer legal protections for registered domestic part-
ners, if you’re in a domestic partnership, don’t assume that separation or 
ending your relationship will affect your will. That is, if you leave assets to 
your domestic partner, unless you amend or revoke your will, expect your 
domestic partner to inherit it.
Remarriage
When you get married for a second time (or third, or fourth . . .), you have 
to consider not only how you will provide for your spouse, but also how 
your new estate plan will affect your intentions for your children from a prior 
marriage.
Further, your spouse’s statutory inheritance (the percentage of your estate 
the state requires you to leave to your spouse) is very likely to reduce every 
significant inheritance included in your existing will. Some bequests are likely 
to be eliminated. It’s very unlikely that your estate plan as administered will 
resemble what you intended when you executed your will.
 
Estate planning for second marriages, and dealing with mixed families, is a 
complicated subject. I discuss this topic in more detail in Chapter 4.
New children (born or adopted)
When a child joins your family, it’s a joyous occasion. But as any parent 
knows, with that joy comes an awful lot of responsibility. One such responsi-
bility? You guessed it: updating your estate plan.
Updating your estate plan is important not only because you want to provide 
for your new child. If you don’t update it, your current estate plan may be 
seriously disrupted. Your new child may even inherit a far greater portion of 
your estate than any other heir.
How so? States have laws protecting the rights of pretermitted (accidentally 
omitted) heirs. Most often, the omitted heir is a child born after the execu-
tion of your will. These laws are different in each state, but one possible 
result is that the omitted child receives an intestate share of your estate — 
the percentage the child would have received had you died without a will.
Imagine that your will gives your other children less than their intestate 
share, perhaps because you’re also leaving bequests to other relatives and to 
charity. If your omitted child gets a full intestate share, your other bequests 
are reduced to provide for that share. Some items of property that you had 
intended to go to your heirs are sold. Perhaps some of your bequests go 
unfilled. Your other children may inherit far less than your omitted child.
The outcome is similar if you have no other children. Your child’s share of 
the estate still comes out of your other bequests, and your intended bequests 
may not be fulfilled.

130
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
In some states, the bequests you make for your other children may be 
reduced proportionately so that your omitted child receives an equal share. 
But what if you left real estate or items of personal property to your children, 
and not cash? To give your omitted child an equal share, those assets will 
likely have to be liquidated.
 
You can minimize the need to update your will by providing class gifts, such 
as “I leave 50 percent of my estate to my children.” Although the pool gets 
divided into smaller shares with each new child, you don’t need to change 
your will to provide for subsequent children. My advice, whether or not 
you use class gifts, is to make childbirth or adoption an occasion to update 
your will.
See Chapter 8 for tips on providing for or disinheriting children unknown to 
you or not born at the date you execute your will.
Deaths of intended heirs
When one of your beneficiaries dies, the distribution of your bequest 
may change based upon the laws of your state, the terms of your will, and 
whether or not the beneficiary has heirs:
 
 Your bequest will lapse and become part of the residuary of your estate.
 
 The bequest will be distributed to the heirs of your intended beneficiary.
The impact of a major beneficiary’s death on your estate plan can be pro-
found. Consider, for example, what might happen if your spouse dies before 
you do. Did you draft your will with that possibility in mind? If not, your 
estate plan will probably be left in shambles.
Also, you may not want your bequest to go to the heirs of your designated 
beneficiary. In many cases, the only way to prevent that occurrence is by 
amending your will.
 
You may designate alternate beneficiaries in your will. Consider this example: 
You leave your wedding ring to your eldest daughter, Joan, and she tragically 
dies before you. Her surviving heir, your son-in-law, is a nice enough guy, 
but why should he inherit a family heirloom? If you designate your younger 
daughter, Katie, as the alternate heir, even with Joan’s death your ring stays 
within the family. If Joan has children, you also have the option of designating 
a grandchild as the alternate heir.
Changes in your wishes
If you wrote a will a few years ago and haven’t reviewed it, take a look at it 
now. Unless you did little more than leave everything to your spouse and chil-
dren, you’ll probably be a bit surprised by some of the bequests you made.

131
 Chapter 9: When You Already Have a Will
Say that you were going to give your best friend Harry $500,000 until your 
wife . . . well, you know the cliché. But the fact remains, your wishes will 
probably change over time. Not only because you’re angry with somebody, 
but also because the life circumstances of your beneficiaries will change.
Although lives can change in countless ways, here are some common 
examples:
 
 Your will provides for bequests intended to make sure that your grand-
children can afford college educations. Since you wrote your will, 
they’ve all graduated from college.
 
 Your son has fallen deeply into debt and is hounded by creditors. If you 
leave him a cash bequest, his creditors will snatch it up to service his 
debts.
 
 Your cousin has had a financial windfall since you wrote your will and 
simply doesn’t need your money.
The primary purpose of your will is to distribute your estate in the manner 
you want, so make sure that your will reflects your wishes.
Changes in your financial situation
As you get older, your estate is likely to grow. It also may decline in value, 
whether due to the cost of medical care, a drop in the stock market, or some 
other unforeseen financial setback. Even when the changes are good, they 
can disrupt your plan for your estate.
 
Review your estate plan upon your retirement. You should also create or 
update your plan for incapacity, as described in Chapter 14.
Do you still have the described assets?
You probably have treasured items or family heirlooms that you want to 
leave to specific people. But what happens if these items are no longer part 
of your estate when you die? Lawyers call it ademption. Your heir will call it 
“Getting a whole lot of nothing.”
Here are a few examples:
 
 You collect vintage cars and have a 1931 Bugatti Royale Kellner Coupe. 
You draft your will, leaving it to your brother. The next year, a car col-
lector sees it and persuades you to put it up for auction. It fetches the 
highest price ever received for a car at auction, $8.7 million. You die 
three years later. You still have much of that cash in your estate, but the 
car is gone, and your brother gets nothing.

132
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
 
 You leave an heir a cash gift and don’t have enough cash in your estate 
to cover the gift. Assets from the residuary of your estate will be sold to 
cover the bequest.
 
 You leave your son, Augustus, “My vacation home in Traverse City, 
Michigan.” But during your retirement, you decide that you want to 
vacation in a warmer place. You sell your Traverse City cottage and buy 
a condo in Florida. If you don’t update your will, your bequest to your 
son will adeem, and the condo will be distributed as part of the residu-
ary of your estate.
 
 You have a $600,000 estate comprised of a $200,000 house, $200,000 in 
savings, and $200,000 in personal property. You decide to leave your 
house to your eldest daughter, Joan, the cash to your son, Sean, and the 
residue of your estate (everything else) to your youngest child, Ellen. 
Medical expenses from your last illness and the cost of probating your 
estate consume most of your savings. Joan still gets the house, the resi-
due of the estate is sold until Sean gets his $200,000 in cash, and Ellen 
may get little or nothing from your estate.
 
During your periodic review of your will, verify that the assets you describe 
remain in your estate. Consider whether you’re likely to have enough cash in 
your estate to cover any monetary bequests. If you don’t, update your will.
Have you acquired additional assets?
As your estate grows, will your new assets be distributed as you intend under 
your old will? For example:
 
 You purchase a vacation home.
 
 You inherited a house full of antiques from your parents.
 
 You’re an avid stamp collector, and you add many valuable stamps to 
your collection, doubling its value.
Right away, you need to consider two things:
 
 Do your new assets affect your specific bequests? For example, if you 
leave your car to one child and your stamp collection to the other, do 
you need to balance the bequests due to the increased value of the 
stamp collection?
 
 Will your new assets end up in the residuary of your estate? If so, is 
that consistent with your goals? For example, if you intended the residu-
ary to be a few thousand dollars and left it to charity, will your new vaca-
tion home also go to the charity?
If either of those conditions apply, most likely a will update is in order.

133
 Chapter 9: When You Already Have a Will
What if your estate plan treats the bulk of your estate as joint or community 
property with your spouse? If you receive a gift or inheritance, it’s your own 
separate property. Your will didn’t even contemplate that you would have 
the new asset. Most likely, if you want it to go to somebody other than your 
spouse, you need to change your will.
You must also consider whether you’ll owe estate taxes. If so, how will your 
estate pay them? With no plan in place, if you divide your estate between 
your heirs without considering taxes, the tax bite will affect the inheritance of 
some of your heirs and will likely cause some heirs to inherit unequally. For 
more information on tax planning, see Chapter 6.
Changing Your Will
As long as you remain legally competent, you may change your will at any 
time during your life. Your choices for amending your will are
 
 Amendment by codicil, a supplementary document that changes 
your will
 
 Executing a new will that revokes your prior will and reflects the 
changes you desire
If you attempt a different method of amendment, your change will probably 
be disregarded by the probate court. Worse, you may invalidate your entire 
will. Here are a few methods that don’t work:
 
 Writing or typing a note in the margin of your existing will
 
 Writing or typing between the lines of text on your existing will 
(an interlineation)
 
 Erasing, crossing out, or scribbling over part of your will
A fine legal mind, but not an 
estate planning lawyer
United States Supreme Court Chief Justice 
Warren Burger drafted his own will. He typed the 
document himself, dividing his estate between 
his two children. He made two costly errors.
First, he neglected to grant his executors the 
power to sell his property. They had to go to 
the probate court for that authority, resulting in 
unnecessary legal fees.
But the biggest cost came from his failure 
to plan for estate taxes. With some simple 
tax planning, he may have been able to com-
pletely avoid estate tax. But the thought appar-
ently didn’t even cross his mind, and about a 
quarter of his estate went to state and federal 
estate taxes.

134
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
 
Some states permit you to refer in your will to a tangible personal property 
memorandum. This document lists specific items of personal property, such 
as cars, boats, furniture, clothing, jewelry, decorative items, or a stamp collec-
tion, and states an heir for each listed item.
Although some states require your tangible personal property memorandum 
to be complete at the time your will is executed, other states permit you to 
amend the memorandum at any time. In those states, this memorandum can 
be a useful tool for changing your heirs for items of personal property with-
out amending your will.
Adding to your will (amendment 
by codicil)
When you look at the U.S. Constitution, you can see that the original text is 
the same as it was when the Constitution was ratified. Not one word of the 
original text has been changed. The Constitution has been amended, many 
times. But each amendment is added to the end.
Amending a will by codicil works the same way. A codicil adds to your will, 
changes an existing provision, or invalidates part of your will, but the original 
text of your will doesn’t change. You can execute as many codicils as you 
want. Your later codicils may amend or revoke earlier codicils.
Codicils are best used to make simple changes to your will. Where your 
changes are more complex, or where you have a series of codicils, you 
should execute a new will. Why?
 
 Figuring out exactly how your codicil interacts with the original text 
of your will can be difficult.
 
 If you have multiple codicils, you need to figure out both how the 
codicils interact with your original will and how they interact with 
each other.
 
 Your codicil may be lost or separated from your will, whether by 
accident or through the bad act of the person who first finds your will.
The more codicils you have or the more complicated your amendment, 
the more likely it is that your heirs will disagree over your intentions. Their 
disagreement or confusion can lead to unnecessary probate litigation.
Executing a valid codicil
A codicil is witnessed and executed in the same manner as your will. In 
essence, a codicil is a short will that supplements or revokes in part your 
earlier will. When you execute your codicil, remember the following:

135
 Chapter 9: When You Already Have a Will
 
 Your codicil must be dated.
 
 Your codicil should be witnessed and executed in the same manner as a 
new will.
Your codicil should be kept with your will.
Revoking Your Will
Your will doesn’t become effective until you die. Thus, you may revoke your 
will at any time during your life. Be careful, as probate proceedings will 
become complicated if you don’t revoke your will properly, or if your heirs 
find more than one will and disagree about which one is valid.
 
Once your old will is revoked, don’t try to bring it back from the dead. As a 
general rule, you can’t reinstate a revoked will. If you want to reinstate the 
terms of a revoked will, execute a new will that incorporates those terms.
A few states may permit you to execute a witnessed document stating that 
you want to revive your prior will, but even if you’re in one of those states 
executing a new will is just as easy to do.
 
If you don’t revoke your old will when you execute your new will, both remain 
in effect. Your new will is effectively a lengthy codicil to your old will.
Thus, if you do not revoke your prior will:
 
 If you make bequests of the same property in both wills, the new will 
governs.
 
 If you make a bequest of property in the old will but make no mention of 
that property in your new will, the old will governs.
For example, if your old will leaves your car to your nephew, and your new 
will leaves your car to your sister, your sister inherits the car. If your new will 
doesn’t mention the car, your nephew inherits the car.
How to revoke a will
You can revoke your will in one of three ways (although your state may 
extend only the first two options):
 
 Execute a new will that explicitly revokes all prior wills and codicils.
 
 Physically destroy your will with the intention of revoking it. (You 
should collect and destroy all copies, as well.)

136
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
 
 In some states, execute a document that revokes your prior will. 
Typically, you must execute it in the presence of two witnesses.
The most common method of revocation is to execute a new will stating that 
all prior wills and codicils are revoked. I recommend this approach for sev-
eral reasons:
 
 There won’t be a gap in your estate plan, as you avoid creating a period 
of time when you don’t have a will.
 
 If a prior will is found and submitted to the probate court, your intent to 
revoke that prior will is clear and in writing.
 
If you revoke a will by destroying it, remember that the probate court must 
find that you had the intent to revoke your will. If an heir argues that the will 
was lost or was destroyed by accident, the probate court may accept a copy 
for probate. Thus, if you choose to destroy a will by destroying it, destroy it in 
front of some witnesses who will be able to testify as to your intent.
What to do with a revoked will
You will usually get one of two answers if you ask what to do with your 
revoked will:
 
 You may destroy the original and all copies of your old will, preferably 
in front of witnesses who can affirm that you did so with the intent of 
revoking it.
 
 You may preserve the old will or preserve an unsigned copy while 
destroying the original, clearly marking on every page that it’s revoked 
(by writing “Void” or “Revoked”). If you’ve executed a new will, also 
write on each page that it was superseded by your new will (for 
example, “Revoked By Will Dated April 17, 2008”).
 
While you may believe that a provision in your new will declaring the prior 
will to be revoked is sufficient, you have to be careful. If you don’t mark the 
old will as revoked, somebody may try to submit it to the probate court as 
your final will.
Why preserve an old will instead of destroying it? In case somebody chal-
lenges your testamentary capacity or claims you executed the will due to 
somebody’s undue influence. If your prior will is largely the same as your 
current will, convincing a court that your final will doesn’t reflect your actual 
wishes will be difficult.

Chapter 10
Estate Administration: What 
Happens in Probate Court
In This Chapter
 Probating an estate
 Paying your final debts
 Protecting your estate against will contests
Your estate is the total amount of property you own at the time of 
your death. Probate is the process through which a court confirms 
the validity of your will, and supervises the settlement of your estate.
This chapter describes what happens when a will is submitted to a probate 
court, how the probate process works, and what happens if somebody 
contests your will.
Navigating Probate Court
Once a person dies, the estate is submitted to the probate court, and the pro-
cess of confirming the validity of your will begins. A probate court is the court 
authorized to oversee the administration of your will and the settlement of 
your estate. If you have a will, the probate court determines whether the will 
is valid and then oversees the administration of the estate by the executor 
(the person appointed in the will by the decedent to oversee the estate). If 
you don’t have a will or the will is determined to be invalid, the probate court 
appoints an administrator, and your property is distributed according to the 
state’s laws of inheritance.
Probate proceedings begin when your personal representative or the custo-
dian of your will files your will with the probate court, or when some other 
person files a petition seeking to administer your estate. The person who 
submitted the petition to the court is known as the petitioner.

138
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
The probate court’s actions include
 
 Receiving your will and entertaining any challenges to its validity
 
 Appointing a personal representative (also known as an executor) for 
your estate
 
 Supervising the actions of your personal representative
 
 Requiring that legally interested parties (your legal heirs) are notified 
of the proceeding
 
 Settling disputes between people who claim to be entitled to your 
assets.
 
 Overseeing the payment of debts owed by your estate
 
 Approving the distribution of your estate’s assets to your heirs
The probate court also oversees the final tax returns filed by your estate and 
the payment of any estate taxes.
Probate court proceedings are open to the public, and members of the public 
can examine the probate court file for your estate, which includes your will 
and bequests. Although some people are troubled by their estate being a 
matter of public record, except in cases involving celebrities, it’s unusual for 
any aspect of an estate to be publicized.
Discovering How Estate Size 
Affects Probate Procedures
Probate has a reputation for being slow and costly, and that reputation isn’t 
entirely undeserved. Fortunately, state legislatures have recognized that the 
type of probate procedures necessary to safeguard the assets of large estates 
are often unnecessary for smaller estates, and many smaller estates are 
resolved through a faster, less costly process.
 
For probate court, the size of your estate relates only to the assets that pass 
through the probate process. If you’ve used estate planning tools, such as a 
living trust to pass your assets to your heirs outside of probate, you can leave 
a substantial asset to your heirs while still taking advantage of simplified pro-
bate procedures.
Probate for small estates
Although probate laws are different in each state, most states offer two levels 
of simplified probate for small estates.

139
 Chapter 10: Estate Administration: What Happens in Probate Court
Some estates have very limited assets, perhaps just a few thousand dollars, 
so it may be possible to seek disposition of personal property without admin-
istration by a probate court. The person who pays the final expenses of the 
estate, such as medical bills or funeral costs, submits a simple petition to the 
court requesting reimbursement, along with
 
 The decedent’s death certificate
 
 Paid bills claimed for reimbursement
 
 Documentation describing the asset to be released
 
 A copy of the decedent’s will (if one exists)
If the court accepts that the petitioner is entitled to the decedent’s assets, 
the court issues an authorization for the transfer or release of those assets 
to the petitioner.
For more substantial estates that don’t exceed a certain limit (usually 
between $70,000 and $100,000) and where the estate’s creditors are known, 
the estate will likely qualify for summary administration. Summary adminis-
tration is a streamlined probate process that’s designed to be faster and less 
expensive than the full probate process. This process has significantly less 
court oversight than with full probate proceedings.
In most states, absent any unexpected complications, simplified probate 
proceedings take two to four months. Being in probate for several months 
doesn’t mean that your estate will be tied up in court proceedings through-
out that time. Your administrator and the lawyer for your estate perform 
most of the work in probating your estate outside of court. If everything goes 
smoothly, the court hearing to settle your estate may take as little as an hour.
Probate for larger estates
Large estates continue to require formal administration, in which a personal 
representative is appointed to act on behalf of your estate. This process 
typically takes between six months and two years, depending upon the size 
and complexity of your estate.
Understanding the Role of the 
Personal Representative
The personal representative is typically required to be a legal resident of the 
state where your estate is probated or to be a close relative. The personal 
representative is often referred to as the executor or executrix of your estate. 

140
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
Your personal representative is required to act in the best interest of your 
estate and can be held financially responsible for mismanaging the assets of 
your estate.
Upon your death, the personal representative you named in your will must 
decide whether or not to accept that role. If you discussed your estate plan 
with your personal representative and he agreed to serve, he’ll likely accept 
the appointment. Upon your death, your personal representative should 
promptly locate and read your will.
Your personal representative arranges for your funeral and usually follows 
any funeral instructions you leave. If you don’t leave instructions, your per-
sonal representative chooses how to conduct your funeral and burial.
Your personal representative also takes control of your property and finan-
cial accounts, obtains appraisals of your assets to determine their market 
value, and creates an inventory of your estate. Your personal representative 
also opens a checking account for your estate. All estate income is deposited 
into the account, and the estate’s debts are paid from the account.
If necessary, your personal representative will start probate proceedings for 
your will. Your personal representative pays the debts of your estate, files 
all required tax returns, and distributes remaining assets to your heirs. Your 
personal representative’s duties continue until all these tasks have been 
performed and the estate is completely settled.
Your personal representative has the right to be paid for his services. You 
can provide for compensation in your will, as agreed with your personal 
representative. If you don’t provide for compensation or don’t have a will, 
your personal representative may request compensation from the court. 
Depending upon the laws of your state, the compensation granted by a court 
will be an hourly fee or a percentage of the value of your estate. A member 
of your family often agrees to serve as your personal representative without 
charging a fee. Managing an estate is difficult work, and compensating your 
personal representative for his time and effort is perfectly appropriate.
The following sections describe some of the personal’s representative’s 
responsibilities in more detail.
Giving notice to legal heirs
In most states, your legal heirs (the people who inherit from your estate 
under state law if you don’t have a will) are entitled to formal notice of pro-
bate proceedings. The purpose of notice is to give your heirs the opportunity 
to object to the validity of your will or to challenge the proposed distribution 
of your assets, before inheritances are distributed from your estate.

141
 Chapter 10: Estate Administration: What Happens in Probate Court
Some states permit probate without notice to your heirs, but the distribu-
tion of your estate may be left open to legal challenge for years. With formal 
notice, the opportunity to challenge the will or object to the distribution of 
assets normally ends when the estate is closed. For more information of how 
your will may be challenged, see the upcoming discussion on “Avoiding 
Will Contests.”
Collecting property for distribution
Your personal representative must secure your personal property and real 
estate and take appropriate measures to safeguard your property. He needs 
to take control of
 
 Your home and its furnishings
 
 Other real estate holdings
 
 Your car and its keys
 
 Your safe deposit box and its contents
 
 Your savings and retirement accounts and any checkbooks
 
 Your interest in a business you own, or your share of a closely held 
business
Your personal representative must make sure that utility bills are paid for 
your real estate, and that your property is secured and properly maintained. 
Valuables should be protected from theft or loss. Although your existing 
insurance coverage may be adequate, your personal representative should 
contact your insurance companies to inform them of your death and to 
What if somebody makes a grab for your assets?
If you live alone, you may have a valid concern 
that the person who first learns of your death 
will loot your assets. Depending on the circum-
stances, your concern may relate to a nosy 
neighbor, a caregiver, a relative, or even an 
ambulance driver who responds to your home.
Although no plan can be perfect, you should 
consider finding asking someone you trust and 
who lives close enough to you to act quickly in 
an emergency to help you secure your assets 
in the event of your hospitalization or death. 
You may ask them to conspicuously watch your 
home as people come and go or to proactively 
secure certain property or possessions, as well 
as notify your personal representative or next 
of kin.

142
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
continue that coverage. Your personal representative may need to obtain 
additional insurance to fully protect your assets during the settlement of 
your estate.
 
If your estate doesn’t have sufficient funds available to pay its debts, your per-
sonal representative may seek permission from the court to sell assets to pay 
those expenses.
Notifying and paying creditors
Your personal representative should cancel your credit cards and close any 
lines of credit.
As part of the probate process, your creditors can make claims against your 
estate for any money you owe at the time of your death. Which creditors are 
notified of the probate proceedings and how they present their claims to the 
probate court or to your personal representative vary from state to state. 
Creditors have a limited amount of time to submit their claims for payment, 
usually between three and six months from the date notice is given. In states 
where notice to creditors isn’t required or is optional and isn’t given, that 
period can be as long as 24 months.
If your estate doesn’t have sufficient assets to pay all your bills, state law 
determines how creditors are paid, and the extent to which certain creditors 
go unpaid. Your heirs will not inherit your debts.
Your personal representative will pay all valid claims made by your creditors 
out of the assets of your estate. If your personal representative determines 
that a claim isn’t valid, your creditor must file a motion with the probate 
court to obtain payment.
Distributing bequests
After any deadline for the submission of claims against your estate has 
expired and taxes are paid, your personal representative may submit to the 
probate court a proposed final distribution of your estate. In a typical estate, 
most creditors are paid out of the final distribution.
The final distribution describes the inheritances your heirs will receive from 
your estate. After the probate court approves the distribution, debts are 
paid, and inheritances distributed, your personal representative may seek 
an Order of Discharge from the probate court. That order ends the personal 
representative’s duties to your estate.

143
 Chapter 10: Estate Administration: What Happens in Probate Court
Hiring a Lawyer
The personal representative of your estate isn’t required to hire a lawyer. 
Your estate is less likely to need legal services if your personal representa-
tive is your sole heir, and no one is disputing your will or the distribution of 
your assets. However, you should anticipate that your personal representa-
tive will need to hire a lawyer to perform services for your estate, and your 
estate will pay the legal fees.
You can designate an attorney for your estate within your will. In many cases, 
the lawyer who drafted the will is designated as the attorney for the estate.
In many probate cases, the lawyer’s role is largely advisory. In more compli-
cated cases, the lawyer may have to help with court proceedings or defend 
against a will contest. Services the lawyer typically provides include
 
 Helping your personal representative understand her duties
 
 Helping your personal representative understand and interpret the 
provisions of your will
 
 Drafting deeds and conveyances required by the estate
The personal administrator can have the lawyer handle most of the probate 
responsibilities, but this approach can be expensive for your estate.
Most lawyers charge the estate an hourly fee for the services they perform. 
The lawyer may also agree to perform a specific set of services, or even all 
services required by your estate, for a fixed fee. In a minority of states, the 
lawyer can charge a percentage of the value of your estate as his fee.
Overseeing Probate: The Judge
The probate court judge appoints your personal representative, oversees 
the probate proceedings, and approves the distribution of assets from your 
estate. If any motions are brought before the court, such as a request for an 
interpretation of the language of your will, or if a will contest occurs, the pro-
bate court judge presides over the litigation. Will contests are discussed in 
the next section of this chapter, “Avoiding Will Contests.”
Most of the time, the provisions of your will are easily understood. Yet some-
times a will includes an ambiguous or unclear provision. If the administrator 
or an interested party to your estate is uncertain what a provision means, he 
can ask the judge to review the language and issue a ruling as to its meaning.

144
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
The probate judge also supervises the actions of the personal representative. 
The judge may require the personal representative to post a bond to protect 
the estate’s assets in the event of mismanagement or misconduct. The judge 
reviews inventories and accountings submitted by the personal administra-
tor and approves the final distribution of your estate’s assets.
If the judge believes that your personal representative is incapable of per-
forming required tasks or is concerned that your personal representative has 
mismanaged the assets of your estate, the judge may dismiss your personal 
representative and appoint a successor.
The proposed final distribution of the estate must be submitted to the judge 
for approval. The judge listens to any objections to the final distribution and, 
depending upon evidence submitted, approves or rejects it.
If the proposed final distribution is approved, the debts of the estate are 
paid, and inheritances are distributed in accord with its provisions. If the 
proposed final distribution is rejected, the personal representative must 
prepare a new proposed final distribution, taking into consideration the 
reasons for the judge’s ruling.
If somebody contests your will, the probate judge conducts a trial to deter-
mine the validity of your will. In some states, either the person bringing the 
contest or the estate may request a jury trial.
Avoiding Will Contests
A will contest is a formal challenge to the validity of part or all of your will. If 
you’re worried about a will contest, relax. The vast majority of wills aren’t 
contested, and most will contests are unsuccessful. Still, to make sure 
that yours is not the exception, you need to be aware of how and why will 
contests occur.
The person who contests a will must be an interested person in your estate. 
As a general rule, he is either named as a beneficiary in a prior will or entitled 
to a share of your estate under the laws of intestate succession (laws that 
identify heirs and distribute the assets of people who die without valid wills).
Claiming that an inheritance is unfair won’t support a will contest. The con-
test must be premised upon a valid legal ground concerning the validity of 
the will, your capacity to make a will, or undue influence (somebody coerces 
you into making bequests against your better judgment), fraud against you, 
or mistake.
When a will contest succeeds, the most common outcomes are for the 
court to

145
 Chapter 10: Estate Administration: What Happens in Probate Court
 
 Disallow part of your will, but leave the remaining provisions in effect
 
 Disallow your will in favor of a prior will
 
 Disallow your will and treat you as having died intestate (with no will)
Some law firms specialize in will contests, typically charging the client a 
percentage of the money obtained from your estate. Your estate has to hire 
a lawyer to defend it against the challenge, and the distribution of your 
estate may be held up during months or even years of litigation. The cost 
of challenging your will can be free to the person making the challenge and 
potentially very costly to your estate and your intended heirs.
 
Although you can include a noncontest provision in your will, which disinherits 
anyone who contests your will, the provision may have limited effect. A non-
contest provision prevents inheritance only if the heir bringing the challenge 
to your will is unsuccessful and doesn’t save your estate the cost of defend-
ing against the challenge. Your noncontest provision must include a gift over 
provision, which describes how the forfeited share is to be distributed in the 
event of a will contest.
Even when a will contest is unsuccessful, some states won’t apply noncontest 
clauses if your heir is found to have had good cause (see the next section) to 
contest your will. If the challenge is settled, as often occurs, the clause will 
have no effect. Further, if you disinherit an heir, that heir has nothing to lose 
in bringing a challenge.
 
You can minimize the chances of a challenge to your will based on fraud or 
undue influence by documenting your reasons for making bequests that may 
seem surprising or unfair. You can discuss your reasoning with your heirs so 
that they understand your intentions and won’t be shocked when they see 
your will.
Validity
The first class of challenge to a will claims that your will isn’t valid. The most 
common claims relate to the execution of the will:
 
 You did not sign the will.
 
 The will was improperly witnessed.
 
 The will was not properly notarized.
When you prepare your will with the help of a lawyer, it’s unlikely that its 
execution will be successfully challenged. When you prepare your own will, 
you must take care to follow the instructions for proper execution of your 
will, as even a small mistake can result in its being declared invalid.

146
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
Another set of claims relate to the validity or authenticity of the will itself:
 
 The will is a forgery.
 
 The will submitted to the court isn’t your most recent will. If proved 
valid, the newer will replaces the older will.
It may also be alleged that the will was procured by a fraud against you. Even 
though you were of sound mind and executed a will consistent with your tes-
tamentary goals, it’s alleged that somebody intentionally deceived you into 
changing your bequests. For example, somebody may trick you into believing 
that she’s a long-lost relative in order to be added to your will. Your child 
may try to get you to disinherit your new spouse by convincing you that 
your spouse is unfaithful. The facts rarely exist to support this type of fraud 
claim, but if it’s proved that you relied upon fraudulent misrepresentations 
when making your will, and that the person making the misrepresentations 
intended to influence your will, the court may set aside part or all of the will.
In another form of fraud, somebody who is helping to prepare your will may 
misrepresent the content of the document in order to trick you into signing 
it. If it’s proved that you did not know the content of the will you signed, the 
will isn’t valid.
 
You can help ensure that your most recent will is submitted to the probate 
court by making sure that you void or destroy prior wills and keep your cur-
rent will in a safe, secure place.
Mental incapacity
When you execute your will, you must have testamentary capacity, mean-
ing that you must be “of sound mind.” In other words, you have the mental 
capacity to understand your assets, your relationship to your intended 
beneficiaries, and the effect of your will. If somebody challenging your will 
proves to a probate court that you lacked testamentary capacity, the probate 
court will declare your will to be invalid.
The most common allegations of incapacity are that
 
 You weren’t mentally competent when you signed your will. This 
claim may be based upon advanced age or illness. Even where it’s not 
disputed that you were competent at a later date, somebody contesting 
your will can allege that you were temporarily incompetent at the time 
you signed your will.
 
 You were under the influence of alcohol or drugs when you 
signed your will. Someone can make this claim even if you only take 
prescription medications.

147
 Chapter 10: Estate Administration: What Happens in Probate Court
The person making this challenge presents evidence to the court that you 
were of unsound mind when you created your will. Evidence may include 
medical records and testimony about unusual behaviors or irrational 
conduct around the time of the execution of your will.
 
The most common step taken by people who anticipate a challenge to their 
mental capacity is to have their doctors affirm that they were mentally compe-
tent when they executed their wills. For example, at the time you execute your 
will, you can visit your family doctor, describe that you’re making a will, and 
have the doctor record in your medical chart that you displayed full testamen-
tary capacity at the time of your visit. You can have your doctor write a letter, 
or more formally an affidavit (a written statement made under oath), reciting 
that you’re mentally competent to execute a will and then keep that document 
with your will. You can do the same with an independent psychiatrist — 
somebody who has no treatment relationship with you and who performs an 
independent evaluation of your competence solely in relation to your will.
If you’re very concerned about a will contest, you can also hire a professional 
legal videographer (a person experienced who makes legally admissible video 
recordings) to record a signing ceremony, where you discuss your will and 
your wishes for your estate, explain your reasoning for your choices, and 
then execute your will in front of your witnesses and notary. This video is 
simply a supplement to documentation you obtain from medical doctors.
Compensating your caregiver child without 
triggering an estate contest
If your adult child takes care of you during the 
later years of your life, you may decide that your 
child deserves an inheritance that rewards that 
hard work and sacrifice. But how will your other 
children react? Usually, the other children are 
grateful and understanding, but in some cases, 
they are resentful or suspicious of the unequal 
inheritance. You can, however, minimize the 
likelihood of a will contest or any hard feelings 
between your children after you die.
Talk to your children about your plans so that 
they’re not surprised when they learn what is in 
your will and so that they know that your choice 
was freely made. Also, consider alternatives to 
unequal inheritance, such as paying your child 
a salary during your lifetime.
If your child lives with you and cares for you in 
your home, your instinct may be to leave your 
home to the caregiver child. Often, your home 
will be the most significant asset in your estate, 
and leaving your home to one child can result in 
very small inheritances to your other children. 
Consider instead allowing your child to remain 
in your home for a fixed number of years follow-
ing your death, after which the home can be sold 
and the proceeds divided between your heirs.

148
Part II: Everything You Need to Know about Wills 
 
The more documentation you create, the easier it will be for your estate to 
document your testamentary capacity. Statements from your doctors or a 
videotape demonstrating that you knew what you were doing can facilitate a 
quick resolution to a will contest premised upon your incompetence.
Undue influence
A claim of undue influence alleges that you weren’t acting of your own free 
will when you made your will. Although your testamentary capacity isn’t 
challenged, it’s alleged that somebody interfered with your independent 
judgment when you executed your will. An appearance of undue influence 
may arise if you create a new will shortly before your death.
When evaluating allegations of undue influence, a court’s considerations 
include
 
 Your relationship with the person alleged to have exerted undue 
influence.
 
 What motive may have existed to apply undue influence
 
 What opportunity the person had to exert undue influence
 
 Your ability to resist the alleged influence
 
 Whether the provisions of your will are consistent with the claim of 
undue influence
 
 Any connection between the alleged undue influence and the terms 
of your will
Merely pressuring somebody to create a will is not undue influence. The 
issue is whether the influence caused you to distribute your assets differently 
than you otherwise would have done.
Claims of undue influence are often directed at caregivers — whether they’re 
family, friends, or hired help — who receive a larger share of your estate than 
your other heirs expect. Some caregivers do abuse their positions to try to 
get a larger inheritance, and this can happen even when family members pro-
vide your care. Even when it is your sincere wish to reward your caregiver, 
your other heirs may regard your bequest as unfair and may suspect undue 
influence. Similarly, your children of a prior marriage may accuse your new 
spouse of undue influence.
A claim of duress alleges that you executed your will in response to threats 
made against you. For example, someone may allege that you were held 
against your will or threatened with violence if you didn’t sign a will.
If a court finds that you wouldn’t have executed the will if not for the 
improper influence or duress, the court will invalidate your will.

B
eyond the living trust, you can choose from many other types of trusts 
as you plan your estate. This chapter outlines the reasons why you may 
want to use a trust and describes the parts of a trust, including who created 
it, why it was created, where the trust’s assets are, who the trust is created 
for, who’s in charge of it, and when it ends.
What’s a Trust and Why You Need One
Like a will, a trust is a tool used in estate planning. Your trust is a legal entity 
you create to hold assets that, once transferred into the trust, are managed 
in accord with its written terms. Those terms of your trust describe how you 
want the trust’s assets to be managed and distributed. You choose a person 
to manage the assets of your trust, the trustee, who agrees to accept that 
responsibility and to abide by the terms of your trust. You also choose the 
beneficiaries of your trust, and when they receive trust income or distribu-
tion of the trust’s assets.
Any person who creates a trust is called the grantor. The grantor may also be 
referenced as the settlor or donor of the trust. For example, when you create 
a revocable living trust, you are the grantor. You then transfer assets into the 
trust, which is managed by the trustee for the benefit of your beneficiaries.
Some trusts are revocable, meaning that you can change your mind and take your 
assets out of the trust at any time you choose. Other trusts are irrevocable — 
once you create them and transfer assets in, you can’t take those assets back 
out except as described in the trust document.

152
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
Some trusts are extremely complicated to create and fund and should be 
drafted by an estate planning professional. Chapter 12 describes the most 
common types of trusts used in estate planning.
Benefitting from Trusts
Planning your estate with trusts provides a variety of advantages over reli-
ance upon a will alone. Your will remains an essential part of your estate 
plan, but you gain enormous flexibility by adding a trust to the mix. Trusts 
can help you provide for your spouse or child over an extended time, help 
provide supplemental income to people with disabilities, help protect people 
who aren’t good at handling money, and help you avoid probate.
When a living trust may not be for you
There’s a good chance that at some point in 
your life you’ll benefit from a living trust, but 
perhaps not yet. Consider four leading factors 
when deciding whether you need a living trust: 
your age, your family circumstances, the size of 
your estate, and the location of your real estate 
holdings.
If you’re below the age of 50, pay extra attention 
to the costs and burdens of a living trust. If you 
put your home into your trust, you create extra 
paperwork every time you move. You’ll have 
many more years of transferring other assets 
into and out of your trust. You’re likely to end 
up significantly revising your trust several times 
during the remainder of your life. 
If you’re in your 20s or 30s, these costs and 
burdens are even greater. However, if you’re 
facing a disease that will leave you disabled 
and unable to manage your assets, a living trust 
may benefit you even at a young age.
If you have young children, your living trust can 
help you structure their inheritances and provide 
for the management of your estate by a trustee 
of your choice. However, you can accomplish 
the same thing by creating or funding a trust 
with your will. (Chapter 5 explains steps you can 
take to provide for your children.)
If you’re moving on to your second marriage, 
particularly if you have children, your living trust 
can help you keep your assets separate from 
those of your spouse and can help preserve 
inheritances you intend for your children from 
ending up being inherited by your new spouse or 
stepchildren. (See Chapter 2 for information about 
estate planning for complex family situations.)
If you have a smaller estate, particularly if it’s 
less than $100,000 in value, a living trust can 
actually make estate administration more costly 
and cumbersome for your heirs. In most states, 
you’ll qualify for simplified probate, which 
should wrap up your estate quickly and with 
little expense. (See Chapter 10 to find out more 
about probate.)
If you own real estate in more than one state, 
putting your out-of-state holdings into a living 
trust simplifies the probate process and can 
save your estate quite a bit of money. Otherwise, 
to complete probate, your personal representa-
tive has to open a probate case in every state 
where you own real estate.

153
 Chapter 11: The Anatomy of a Trust
 
Not everybody needs a trust. Probate is often quite simple for smaller estates 
(see Chapter 10), and privacy concerns are often overblown. If you can 
achieve your estate planning goals with a simple will, you may want to stop 
there. As you review your estate plan, if your circumstances change, you’re 
free to create and execute a trust.
They’re flexible
Trusts offer you enormous flexibility to decide how your assets will be man-
aged. You can place assets in trust during your lifetime, reserving control over 
them but providing for your trustee to take over if you become incapacitated.
You can create and fund your trust while you’re still alive; while you’re still 
alive and use your will to fund your trust (a pour over trust); or with your will 
(a testamentary trust).
If your trust is revocable, you can revoke your trust and transfer its assets 
back to yourself at any time.
You can provide for your incapacity
Your trustee’s powers to manage trust assets are immediate. You can make 
those powers contingent upon a future event, such as your incapacity. But 
once you become incapacitated by whatever definition you choose to pro-
vide in your trust, your trustee can immediately take control of trust assets 
and start managing those assets for your benefit.
Having your trustee take over management of your estate is a lot easier than 
forcing your heirs to go to court to ask a judge to appoint a conservator to 
manage your estate. In relation to the trust’s assets, banks and financial insti-
tutions are much more likely to defer to the instructions of a trustee, while 
they may be cautious about accepting the validity of a power of attorney. 
While a bank may require an original copy of your durable power of attorney 
before honoring the instructions of your attorney-in-fact, the same concerns 
aren’t present with a trustee because the trust is the owner of its assets.
If your business assets are held in trust, your trustee can immediately step 
in to protect your business interests while your business succession plan is 
implemented.
 
Although a trust can provide significant benefit in the event of capacity, your 
trustee can manage only the trust’s assets. The trustee has no authority over 
assets not owned by your trust. You should still execute a durable power of 
attorney and healthcare proxy, as described in Chapter 14.

154
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
You can avoid taxes
Trusts can be a powerful tool to avoid estate taxes. Common trusts include
 
 The marital deduction trust (A/B trust): This trust takes your marital 
exemption out of your spouse’s taxable estate, while at the same time 
allowing your spouse to enjoy the income produced by the trust and, 
for purposes such as medical care or support, even access the trust’s 
assets.
 
 The Crummey trust: This trust allows you to make tax-exempt gifts 
during your lifetime. These gifts accumulate in a trust to be distributed 
to your beneficiary at a later time.
 
 Irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILITs): An ILIT owns a life insurance 
policy in your name and is the beneficiary of the policy. When properly 
executed and funded at least three years before your death, the insur-
ance proceeds aren’t included in your estate.
Chapter 6 details tax avoidance strategies, and Chapter 12 describes specific 
types of trusts in more detail.
 
A revocable living trust, of itself, doesn’t help you avoid estate taxes. The pri-
mary benefit of a revocable living trust is probate avoidance. You can include 
provisions in your revocable living trust that can help reduce estate taxes, but 
they’re not inherent to that type of trust (see Chapter 12).
 
If you make mistakes with a trust designed to help you avoid estate taxes, the 
IRS may disregard the trust and treat its assets as part of your taxable estate. 
What sort of restrictions might you encounter?
 
 With some trusts used for estate tax planning, you may not serve as 
trustee, and you may not retain control over the trust’s assets once the 
trust is created.
 
 With other trusts, the trust must be in effect for a minimum number of 
years before you die, or the assets are included in your estate.
 
 With still others, trust assets must vest with the beneficiaries within a 
specified timeframe.
If your estate is large enough to pay estate taxes, you should get professional 
assistance in drafting and funding your tax avoidance trusts. At present, the 
federal estate tax exemption is $2 million, meaning that estates valued below 
that amount aren’t subject to federal estate taxes.

155
 Chapter 11: The Anatomy of a Trust
You can avoid probate
When you leave your estate to your heirs with a will or don’t create an estate 
plan at all, a probate court distributes your estate. (For more on the probate 
process, see Chapter 10.) Using a trust provides some significant advantages:
 
 When you leave assets by will, your heirs have to wait months for the 
probate process to finish before your bequests are distributed to them. 
With a trust, your heirs may receive their bequests immediately.
 
 If you operate a business, your trust can become effective during your 
incapacity or immediately upon your death, and your trustee can be 
authorized to immediately start managing your business affairs. With 
probate, your business may languish for weeks or months while your 
heirs petition the court to appoint somebody to manage your interests.
 
 If you’re in an estate where your personal representative and the attor-
ney for the estate are paid a percentage of the value of your estate, 
having major assets held by your living trust may significantly reduce 
the cost of probate.
 
 You can usually avoid having a public probate record of assets that you 
distribute by trust (see the next section).
Although in this chapter I discuss some steps you can take to help ensure that 
your trust is upheld, trusts are very difficult to challenge in probate court. The 
more likely source of probate litigation is the alleged misuse of trust assets 
by your trustee, something you can minimize with a careful choice of trustee, 
careful definition of the trustee’s powers, and a requirement that the trustee 
periodically provide an accounting of the trust’s assets to your beneficiaries.
 
Your estate will have assets that go through probate. If you have a small 
estate, you may have no need to avoid probate, and a living trust may be an 
unnecessary complication and expense in your estate administration. Also, if 
you don’t have a trustworthy trustee, the judicial oversight from the probate 
process may better ensure that your bequests reach your intended heirs.
Probate avoidance may be a benefit of your estate plan, but your focus 
should be on creating the estate plan you want. Chapter 10 explains the pro-
bate process in detail.
A trust can help protect your privacy
If you leave your estate to your heirs with a will or choose not to plan your 
estate at all, your estate will have to be probated. The records of a probate 
court are public, meaning that anybody can go to the courthouse to seek 

156
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
your will, look at the inventory of your estate’s assets, or find out who your 
heirs are and how much money they received.
A trust doesn’t need to go through probate. Thus, in most cases, the terms of 
the trust are never made part of a public record. The size of your estate, the 
identity of your heirs, and the amount you leave to each remains private.
Selecting a Trustee
Depending upon the trust, the trustee may be you, a trusted friend or family 
member; a professional, such as a lawyer or accountant; or an institution, 
such as a bank
You may also designate cotrustees so that more than one person manages 
your trust. If you do choose cotrustees, you should also describe the powers 
they each may exercise individually and those that must be exercised jointly. 
For example, you might permit either trustee to pay your medical bills, but 
require both trustees to agree to the sale of a trust asset, such as real estate.
If you choose cotrustees, you should provide a mechanism for dispute reso-
lution, be it a coin toss, drawing the high card from a deck of cards, or formal 
mediation or arbitration.
“I see things differently”
If a beneficiary challenges your trustee’s 
actions, is your trustee the type of person who 
will scrupulously adhere to the terms of the 
trust? Or will she reply, “That may be what the 
trust says, but I see things differently”?
When you pick your trustee, anticipate the 
possibility that your trustee may have different 
goals and wishes than you do. It’s great that 
your son is willing to serve as trustee without 
charging a fee and manage the money you’re 
leaving to your minor grandchildren. But con-
sider how your son’s plans for your money may 
differ from your own.
It is not unheard of for a trustee to “borrow” 
money from a trust, perhaps with the full inten-
tion of paying it back. If your son encounters 
financial difficulties or simply chooses to augment 
his lifestyle with periodic “loans,” what are the 
odds that the money will actually be repaid? I’ll 
tell you: They’re exceedingly small. Similarly, 
your son may feel that his children will inherit 
from him anyway, and thus that it’s perfectly 
reasonable for him to spend the money rather 
than continuing to hold it in trust.
When your trustee is family and misappropri-
ates funds meant for other family members, 
the odds are that your trust distribution will be 
redefined by your trustee’s misconduct. In most 
cases, other relatives aren’t willing to file a law-
suit to compel a family member to repay money 
taken from the trust. Would your grandchildren 
really sue their father? And even if they were 
willing to sue, the trustee typically doesn’t have 
the money to repay the trust.

157
 Chapter 11: The Anatomy of a Trust
Questions to consider when selecting a trustee include
 
 Is the person responsible with money and capable of managing money 
and other assets?
 
 Is the person willing and able to carry out the terms of your trust?
 
 Is the person trustworthy and fully prepared to manage the assets of the 
trust solely for the benefit of the beneficiaries?
 
 Does the person have time to manage your trust?
 
 Is the person willing and able to provide regular accountings to the ben-
eficiaries, consistent with state law and the terms of the trust?
 
Serving as trustee is difficult work, and not everybody is prepared to accept the 
task or perform it indefinitely. Your trustee will also grow older and may become 
ill or unable to serve. It is important to designate at least one successor trustee.
Your trust will continue even if you don’t designate a successor. If your 
trustee dies or becomes unwilling to serve and you haven’t designated a suc-
cessor, your heirs will have to go to court to have a judge appoint a trustee. 
Expect that any person a court appoints will charge fees to the trust, and that 
those fees will not be limited by the terms of your trust.
Anticipating conflicts
When you choose your trustee, be aware of 
how conflicts might arise between your trustee 
and your beneficiaries. Choose a trustee you 
trust to stand up for the outcome you want.
A common source of conflict arises when 
you have two classes of beneficiary, one who 
receives the benefit of your estate for life, and 
the rest who receive the benefit of your estate 
after the initial beneficiaries die. For example, 
you may give your spouse the benefit of your 
home and the income from your trust during her 
life, while your children from a prior marriage 
will receive the balance of your trust when your 
spouse dies.
Your children may pressure your trustee to 
invest trust assets in investments that have a 
high long-term rate of return, but which provide 
little or no present income or are high risk. Your 
spouse will likely prefer that investments pro-
duce a high income, even if those investments 
produce little or no long-term appreciation. Your 
trustee must be able to stand up to the compet-
ing demands and enforce your trust as it was 
written and as you intended.
Sometimes your beneficiaries will have different 
ideas than the trustee of when special distribu-
tions may be made or may harangue the trustee 
to try to obtain loans against a delayed gift. Your 
trustee should be able to withstand the pres-
sure and make the choices you intended.
Making one of your children your trustee can 
be unwise if you expect that your other siblings 
will make such demands. Your trustee child is 
forced into a parental role, having to say “no” 
to your other children in circumstances where 
they believe they have every right to the money, 
or where they feel that they “deserve it” no 
matter what the trust says. This responsibility 
can create significant conflict and resentment 
between your children.

158
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
Choosing Your Beneficiaries
Every trust must have at least one beneficiary. Common beneficiaries include 
your spouse and children; your friends; charities; and educational organizations.
You can designate individuals (“My daughter, Sarah”) or classes (“My grand-
children”) as beneficiaries of your trust. Just make sure that your descrip-
tions are sufficiently clear that your beneficiaries can be identified.
Transferring Assets into Your Trust
In order for your trust to be effective, you must transfer ownership of prop-
erty into the trust. Although I prefer the term assets, you may sometimes 
hear the property held by a trust identified as the res or corpus of the trust.
A trust may be created to hold a specific asset, such as a house or life insur-
ance policy. It may be more general, created to hold whatever assets you 
transfer over to the trust. But whatever the design and purpose of your 
trust, for any assets you intend to include in the trust, you should define the 
powers of the trustee and how you ultimately want those assets to be distrib-
uted to your beneficiaries.
When you create your trust, you can and should put the cart before the 
horse. Even though the trust won’t become effective in relation to a particu-
lar asset until it’s transferred into the trust, your trust should reflect your 
wishes and intentions.
Say, for example, that you own a primary home and a vacation home. You 
can describe in your revocable living trust how you want those properties 
used, managed, and maintained after your death. Then, after the trust is 
executed, you can deed the properties over to the trust. The same is true for 
investment accounts or other assets you intend to place in your trust.
 
Your trustee must know the location of your trusts in order to manage them. 
Make sure that your trust describes its assets clearly so that the trustee 
knows what and where they are.
Staying in control
With many trusts, you may retain significant control over trust assets even 
after they’re transferred into your trust. If your trust is revocable, one obvi-
ous power you retain is the right to revoke the trust.

159
 Chapter 11: The Anatomy of a Trust
With a revocable living trust, you typically name yourself as the initial trustee 
and maintain full control of your assets. Even if your trustee takes control of 
your trust upon your incapacity, you can require your trustee to continue to 
defer to your wishes, to the extent that you remain able to make and commu-
nicate informed choices.
Other types of trusts, particularly those used for estate tax avoidance, 
require that you surrender most or all of your control of the asset to an 
independent trustee. Even then, you may be able to provide for your use and 
enjoyment of trust assets as long as the trust continues.
Giving (or limiting) your trustee powers
When you draft your trust, you may give the trustee very broad powers 
over the trust’s assets, or you may grant narrow powers. Powers commonly 
granted within a revocable living trust include
 
 The power to manage and sell property, including real estate
 
 The power to rent or lease real property
 
 The power to borrow money for the benefit of the trust
 
 The power to invest the assets of the trust
 
 The power to litigate claims on behalf of the trust
 
 The power to compensate professionals, such as lawyers, accountants, 
and property managers who provide services to the trust
 
 The power to make special distributions of the trust’s assets for the ben-
efit of the beneficiaries (for example, to help with a medical emergency).
 
 The power to make certain gifts
You can provide the trustee with additional powers or restrict the trustee’s 
powers. For example, you can authorize the trustee to sell the trust’s assets 
in the event that the trust runs short of money, but require that assets be 
sold in a particular order or that certain assets (such as your home) be 
retained as long as the trust is able to avoid selling them. Ultimately, the 
trustee has as much or as little power as you choose to give.
Not all trusts permit significant restriction of the trustee’s powers. You won’t 
be surprised that you’re most likely to be limited in your ability to restrict 
the trustee’s powers with trusts created for estate tax avoidance.
Cancelling the trust
When you create a trust, you will create it either as a revocable trust or as an 
irrevocable trust. As you’ve already figured out, you can revoke a revocable 

160
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
trust at any time you choose. You cannot revoke an irrevocable trust, and 
once you transfer assets into the trust you cannot get them back out.
The trust you are most likely to use in your estate plan is the revocable living 
trust. You are most likely to use irrevocable trusts if you have a large estate, 
and you wish to avoid estate taxes.
Distributing trust assets
As with your will, when you draft your trust, you get to pick where your 
money goes. You may also impose limits on gifts, such as when trust income 
or assets will be distributed to your beneficiaries. For example:
 
 You can provide that your children will receive one quarter of their 
inheritance at the age of 18, one quarter of their inheritance upon gradu-
ation from college, and the balance upon reaching the age of 30.
 
 You can provide for your trust to pay for your grandchildren’s educa-
tional expenses until they graduate from college and then provide for a 
lump sum payment of the balance.
 
 You can provide that your children will receive their inheritance upon 
marriage.
You can also create an asset protection or spendthrift trust to help protect 
your child’s inheritance from being lost to creditors, divorce, or poor money 
management.
 
Be aware as you add contingencies that you may prevent your gift from ever 
reaching your beneficiary. If you want to be sure that your beneficiary will receive 
a gift even if the condition isn’t met, make sure that you spell out that wish.
For example, if you want to encourage your son to go to college but recognize 
that he may never attend or may drop out, you can provide, “To my son, Ben, 
I give $100,000.00 to be distributed to him upon his graduation from college, 
or when he reaches the age of 35.”
The process of adding conditions to a gift made through your trust is very similar 
to imposing restrictions on a bequest made through a will (see Chapter 8).
 
You can easily get carried away with contingencies, placing restrictions on when, 
how, or why a distribution is to be made. I suggest keeping your trust simple.
Be aware that some states will set aside your living trust, in whole or in part, 
in order to provide for your spouse’s elective share. The elective share is the 
amount of your estate that your spouse is entitled to choose to receive under 
state law, in the event that you leave a smaller bequest in your will.

161
 Chapter 11: The Anatomy of a Trust
Putting Your Trust into Effect
Once you have drafted your trust, you must execute it. That is to say, you need 
to sign and date it in front of witnesses in order to make it legal and effective. I 
suggest having a signing ceremony where the following people are present:
 
 You
 
 Your chosen trustee
 
 Three witnesses (in most states, two will suffice, but having an extra wit-
ness never hurts)
 
 A notary public
Most states require your trust to have at least two witness signatures. I sug-
gest using three witnesses. Not only will that meet the requirements of all 
states, but you also have an extra witness available in the event that some-
body tries to invalidate your trust.
The rule against perpetuities
A perpetuity is a bequest that may never take 
effect, or may not take affect for a very long 
time. The rule against perpetuities is a very 
old estate planning rule, which is meant to pre-
vent property from being indefinitely tied up in an 
estate. Typically, the rule provides that property 
must vest in an heir within “a life in being plus 21 
years.” This rule seems deceptively simple: You 
can leave money to your unborn grandchildren, as 
long as they get the money by the time they turn 21, 
right? While that’s a reasonable application of the 
rule, it’s much more complicated in operation.
For example, imagine that you create an irrevo-
cable trust for the benefit of your grandchildren. 
Your spouse dies, and you remarry and have 
another child. Under the rule against perpetu-
ities, your trust terminates when the youngest 
grandchild born before you created the trust 
turns 21. As your youngest child was not a “life 
in being” when you created your trust, under 
this rule your grandchildren born to that child 
could lose out on any benefit from your trust.
Also, the traditional rule will invalidate a gift 
even if it might vest outside of the maximum 
allowable period. Believe it or not, this was 
once applied to invalidate a conditional bequest 
that would have vested when the youngest heir 
turned 5, on the basis that the child might have 
children before reaching the age of 5.
Many states have modified this rule by statute, 
largely with the goal of preventing that type of 
unwanted outcome. For example, many states 
require gifts to vest within 90 years, with judicial 
reformation of your trust to provide for gifts that 
don’t vest within that time. But you still have to 
be careful when you want to leave assets to 
people who have not yet been born, possibly 
including children or grandchildren you don’t 
expect to be born.

162
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
Here’s the basic process:
 
1. When everybody is present and has established their identities to the 
satisfaction of the notary, the notary “swears everyone in, as if you all 
were going to testify in court.
 
2. In the presence of your witnesses and the notary, you will place your 
initials on every page of the trust and then sign your trust.
 
 If you’re also serving as trustee, you will sign both as grantor and then 
again as trustee in Step 3.
 
3. Your trustee then signs to accept of the terms and conditions of the 
trust and to formally accept the duties of a trustee.
 
 His signature helps ensure that your trustee will in fact serve and is okay 
with the amount of compensation you have authorized under the trust. 
This signature, as you would expect, is made in front of your witnesses 
and notary.
 
4. Next, your witnesses initial every page of your trust and sign your 
trust, affirming that they saw you voluntarily sign your trust.
 
5. Finally, your notary will notarize the trust.
 
 Although in most cases notarization is not required, it can help ensure 
that your trust is upheld in the event of a challenge.
 
Now your trust is signed and sealed, but you’re not done yet. You must trans-
fer assets into your trust (see Chapter 13).
When the Trust Ends
You define in your trust when the trust will end. That may be a relatively 
short period of time, for example, if your trust simply distributes your assets 
upon your death. But if you want to delay your gifts or make gifts in install-
ments over a period of years, your trust may continue for a considerable 
amount of time.
You should provide for how the trustee will distribute any remaining assets 
of your trust after distributing all specific gifts. Even if you don’t think your 
trust will have any remaining assets, the unexpected can happen. For exam-
ple, a beneficiary may die or decline a gift, the trust may receive income from 
a source that you didn’t anticipate, or you may forget to address an asset 
when you make your specific gifts.

W
hatever your estate planning need, you can probably find a trust that 
will fill it. And the more complicated and specialized your estate plan-
ning needs, the more likely it is that you’ll benefit from estate planning with 
trusts. In this chapter, I explore the types of trusts and help you determine 
which one best fits your needs.
Why So Many Choices?
The trust is an incredibly flexible estate planning tool, and it has been 
employed for generations. As tax laws proliferate, new techniques are devel-
oped to legally minimize tax exposure. Each new law or innovation can result 
in a new category of trust, designed to serve a specific need or purpose. 
When a trust succeeds in its goals, and those goals are shared by others, the 
trust is copied and refined.
You probably have a toolbox at home. It probably contains a dozen screw-
drivers of various types and sizes, a hammer, some wrenches, a pair of pliers, 
and a range of other tools. When something needs to be fixed, you pick the 
tool you need to do the job. Estate planning with trusts is similar in concept. 
You identify the estate planning need and pick the trust that is best for the job.
Here’s a sampling of what you can do with a successful trust:
 
 You can use trusts to minimize capital gains taxes, provide yourself with 
an income and charitable tax deductions, and avoid gift and estate taxes.
 
 You can provide for your minor children, children from a prior marriage, 
spouse, an heir with special needs, or even your pet.

164
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
 
 You can also protect your heirs from themselves and their creditors, 
meting out your gifts in installments or using special trusts for people 
who are bad with money.
 
 You can use trusts as part of the succession plan for your family business.
 
 You can provide for gifts to be distributed to multiple generations of 
your family, and at dates well into the future.
The Revocable Living Trust
You’ve heard of a revocable living trust. A lot of what you have heard is prob-
ably hype. Don’t get me wrong — many people benefit from having a revoca-
ble living trust. But before you go through the trouble of setting one up, you 
need to be sure that you’ll benefit from having one.
A revocable living trust is a document that outlines how your property, once 
transferred into your trust, will be managed and distributed to your heirs.
 
 It is revocable because as long as you remain alive and mentally compe-
tent, you may terminate the trust at any time and transfer its assets back 
to yourself.
 
 It is living because it is established during your lifetime and, in most 
cases, remains entirely under your control during your lifetime.
The benefits
When you create your living trust, you choose the person who takes over as 
trustee in the event of your death or incapacity. You define the terms of your 
trust and the powers available to your trustee.
You may also combine your revocable living trust with other types of trusts 
to get greater control over how your assets will be distributed to your heirs, 
or as part of a tax avoidance strategy. The following sections cover some 
additional benefits.
Providing for your care and support while you’re alive
When you initially set up your revocable living trust, aside from the fact that 
your trust will own some of your assets, there’s no significant change in the 
way you live your life. You continue to control your own assets.
But what if something happens to you, and you become incapacitated? With 
a properly prepared trust, your trustee can immediately start managing the 
assets in your trust pursuant to your instructions. Nobody needs to go to 
court to get that authority.

165
 Chapter 12: Dead or Alive: Picking Your Trust
While you can get similar benefits from a durable power of attorney, financial 
institutions are often skeptical of your attorney-in-fact’s claim to have author-
ity over your estate. Often, they’ll demand an original copy of your power of 
attorney, and sometimes they’ll retain the original for a period of time. The 
goal is to prevent fraud, but this process can create a lot of hassle for your 
attorney-in-fact.
 
As your trust owns its assets, financial institutions don’t have similar con-
cerns about ownership or verification of the trust instrument. Your trustee 
will generally have a much easier time taking over the management of your 
assets than an attorney-in-fact.
Distribution of your assets after you pass away
Your revocable living trust can be very simple, instructing your assets to be 
immediately distributed to your heirs upon your death. Or it can be compli-
cated, even creating and funding an additional trust or trusts.
You can delay distribution of your gifts for years, impose conditions that 
your beneficiaries must satisfy before they inherit, give out your gifts in 
installments, provide for the support of your spouse or minor children, or 
implement one of the more sophisticated trusts described in this chapter in 
the section “Choosing from Other Trusts.”
In short, your estate is managed and distributed according to your wishes 
and instructions.
Additional benefits for married couples
The simplest living trust for a married couple is a joint trust. You and your 
spouse can create a joint living trust to hold your marital estate. If something 
happens to you, your spouse can continue to act as trustee without interrup-
tion. After your death, your spouse can amend the trust and add or change 
beneficiaries. When your spouse dies, the trust’s remaining assets are distrib-
uted to the beneficiaries pursuant to the terms of the trust.
You can also incorporate a bypass trust, splitting your revocable living trust into 
two separate trusts upon the death of either you or your spouse. The bypass 
trust can help you avoid estate taxes and also allows you to provide for your 
spouse while ensuring that some of your assets go to other heirs, such as your 
children from a prior marriage. For more detail, see the section entitled “Trusts 
to protect your estate plan if you predecease your spouse: bypass trusts.”
Possible drawbacks
Although the revocable living trust is sometimes pitched as cheap, easy, and 
something “everyone must have,” reality is more complicated. Here’s why:

166
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
 
 Your trust is a separate entity from yourself. Your property doesn’t 
automatically become part of the trust; you must transfer property into 
your trust. After your death, your trust must file its own tax returns.
 
 Administration of your trust after your death may not be cheaper than 
probate and, particularly if your trust will continue for years after your 
death, may be significantly more costly.
 
 Probate proceedings occur under the supervision of a judge, but trusts 
are administered without judicial oversight. If your trustee is incompe-
tent, irresponsible, or dishonest, your beneficiaries are vulnerable to 
mismanagement or misappropriation of funds.
Additional considerations relate to managing property in your trust and the 
time creditors have to make claims against your estate. You should not think 
of your revocable living trust as a tool to reduce or avoid taxes.
Managing your assets once they’re in the trust
After you create a trust, you have to transfer ownership of assets into the 
trust. For the most part, this transfer is just a matter of paperwork. You don’t 
lose your homestead exemption or trigger reassessment when you transfer 
your home into your living trust.
But after your property is in your trust, you may want to sell it. As your trust 
is now the owner of your property, you must either sell the property through 
the trust or transfer it back to yourself prior to the sale.
 
Don’t transfer too much of your property into your trust. It’s okay to have personal 
belongings and furniture as part of your estate, even if those items will go through 
probate. You’ll be making frequent deposits and withdrawals from your checking 
account, so keep it in your own name. Putting your car into your trust can compli-
cate car loans and may result in huge increases in the cost of insurance.
Battling creditors claims in the future
When your estate is probated, your creditors get a specific amount of time to 
make claims against your estate. When that time is up, as long as your admin-
istrator gave proper notice to creditors under your state’s laws, your estate 
may be distributed to your heirs. If a creditor misses the deadline for making 
a claim, the creditor generally loses the opportunity to get paid.
As your trust may hold assets for many years after your death, your credi-
tors don’t operate under similar time constraints. Even if they miss the filing 
deadline for making a claim in probate court, they can try to collect your 
debts from your trust.
Facing more limited tax benefits than you may realize
You may have heard that if you create a revocable living trust, you won’t pay 
estate taxes. The truth is, a revocable living trust of itself offers no protection 

167
 Chapter 12: Dead or Alive: Picking Your Trust
from estate taxes. None. Your taxable estate includes both the value of the 
property in your living trust and the value of your other assets.
To gain a tax advantage, you can combine your revocable living trust with 
another type of trust. If you’re married, you can incorporate elements of an 
A/B trust (bypass trust) so that you can take full advantage of both your own 
estate tax exemption and that of your spouse. But you don’t need a revocable 
living trust to take advantage of the other available trusts. You can create 
them even if you choose not to create a living trust.
The benefits of your revocable living trust are probate avoidance, disability 
planning, and, if you want, increased control over your estate and how it is 
administered and distributed after your death. Whether or not you choose to 
have one is peripheral to your tax avoidance strategy.
Choosing from Other Trusts
Many different types of trust are available to you. Some of the reasons you 
may choose a trust, beyond your living trust, include
 
 Avoiding estate taxes
 
 Implementing a gifting strategy during your lifetime, transferring some of 
your assets to your heirs or to charity while you’re alive
 
 Planning for the succession of your business
 
 Avoiding capital gains taxes or income taxes
 
 Protecting heirs who have special financial needs or vulnerabilities
You may even create a trust to provide for the care and support of your pet.
 
When you read about these trusts, keep the following in mind: The govern-
ment wants your money.
 
 Whenever your trust will keep tax money out of the pockets of Uncle 
Sam or will prevent the state from recouping money a beneficiary 
receives in the form of public assistance, the government has an incen-
tive to try to invalidate your trust.
 
 Whenever your trust will keep money out of the hands of a beneficiary’s 
creditors or prevent a spouse from grabbing a share upon divorce, the 
person who wants the money has an incentive to try to invalidate your trust.
The net result? Rules governing the creation and administration of many of these 
trusts are tricky, and small mistakes can erase the benefits of your trust. Given 
the amounts of money typically involved in these trusts and the consequences of 
getting it wrong, your investment in professional estate planning services will be 
well spent.

168
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
Remember also that although these trusts are described separately, some-
times a single trust may fall into more than one category.
Trusts to avoid the tax man: 
Asset protection trusts
The term asset protection trust encompasses a wide range of trusts designed 
to shelter your money from taxes and creditors.
Many asset protection trusts are set up in foreign nations and are thus called 
offshore trusts. Sometimes the primary benefit of placing money in an offshore 
bank is to protect it from creditors, as the laws of some nations make it very 
difficult for anybody to successfully make a claim against your trust fund.
Some asset protection trusts are exceptionally complicated, and skirt as 
closely as they can to the limits of tax laws. If things go wrong, the govern-
ment may invalidate the trust as a tax shelter and impose significant penal-
ties on people who were relying upon the trust as a tax shelter.
 
Some asset protection trusts are scams, from start to finish. The people 
behind them will make any promise to get your money, and you’ll pay sub-
stantial fees to participate. Yet if the IRS invalidates the tax shelter, you’ll face 
thousands of dollars in fines and penalties.
If you want to try to shelter your assets, work with a domestic financial adviser 
who you trust and be sure to fully investigate the validity of any promised 
All those funny names
Did you hear that right? Your lawyer wants you 
to put your money into GRITs and QTIPs? Into a 
Crummey trust?
As you read this chapter, you’ll find that many 
trusts have cumbersome names. But that’s not 
confusing enough for lawyers who commonly 
refer to trusts by acronym. (Yes, I’m guilty, too.) 
A charitable remainder unitrust becomes a 
CRUT. A grantor retained income trust becomes 
a GRIT. A qualified personal residence trust 
becomes a QPRT (pronounced Kew-Pert). 
Or maybe your lawyer refers to a QPRT as a 
“house GRIT”. And yes, a qualified terminable 
interest property trust is called a QTIP.
A Crummey trust isn’t so crummy. It can be a 
very useful tool to avoid gift and estate taxes. 
Why the odd name? It’s named after the tax-
payer who first defended the trust in court, D. 
Clifford Crummey.
If you get a handle on the lingo, great. If not, 
don’t worry. Your lawyer will know what you 
mean when you ask about an irrevocable life 
insurance trust. And if your lawyer starts talk-
ing about an ILIT (pronounced Eye-Lit), he won’t 
think any less of you if you ask what he means. 
(Besides, he should know better than to use 
jargon with a client.)

169
 Chapter 12: Dead or Alive: Picking Your Trust
tax shelter. As with everything else in life, if it sounds too good to be true, it 
probably is.
Trusts for people who can’t manage 
money: Spendthrift trusts
A spendthrift being somebody who is careless and wasteful with money, the 
spendthrift trust puts obstacles between the beneficiary and the trust assets. 
The beneficiary has no claim to assets in the trust until they’re distributed 
and can’t use the balance of the trust as collateral for a loan. Creditors can’t 
garnish the trust’s assets or distributions.
But that’s just the beginning of the story. These obstacles also help protect 
trust assets from the beneficiary’s creditors or the beneficiary’s spouse in 
the event of divorce. Thus, even if the person is good with money, a spend-
thrift trust can be a useful tool to give money to somebody who may be 
facing divorce, substantial medical costs, or other financial hardships that 
may cause a windfall to be lost to creditors. You may also want to use a 
spendthrift trust when leaving money to children or young adults, rather 
than hoping that they’ll manage money responsibly.
 
A spendthrift trust is irrevocable. To be effective, the trust instrument must 
contain language showing that the grantor intended it to be a spendthrift 
trust. The specific language is defined by statute and thus can be different 
depending upon the laws of the state in which you create the trust.
As the laws governing these trusts are different in each state, you have to 
watch for traps created by your state’s laws. Some states limit the amount of 
money that you can place in a spendthrift trust. Some limit their effectiveness 
against creditors or permit child support to be garnished from distributions.
What if you want to shelter your own money in this way, creating a self-settled 
spendthrift trust for your own benefit? Most states will not allow you to be the 
beneficiary of a spendthrift trust that you create. The exceptions are limited 
and may not be enforceable across state lines.
With the state-specific elements of these trusts, you’re wise to consult a 
lawyer when creating a spendthrift trust.
Trusts for doing good: Charitable trusts
The charitable remainder trust (CRT) is used to make a gift to charity, but you 
still reserve a benefit to yourself. This trust is particularly useful when you 
own property that has appreciated in value, such that its sale would trigger 
substantial capital gains taxes. By instead donating the property to charity, 

170
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
you not only avoid capital gains tax, you also get an income tax deduction for 
a portion of the money you transfer into the trust.
In its standard form, once you place property in your charitable remainder 
trust:
 
 You’re the income beneficiary of the trust, meaning you receive income 
from the trust during your lifetime or over a fixed number of years.
 
 The charity receives any balance remaining in the trust after you die or 
after the term of the trust expires.
The most common variations of a charitable remainder trust are
 
 The charitable remainder annuity trust (CRAT): You receive a fixed 
percentage of your original investment. For example, you invest $100,000 
in the trust and subsequently receive an annual distribution of $7,000, 7 
percent of the trust, whatever the balance of the trust.
 
 The charitable remainder unitrust (CRUT): Each year you receive a dis-
tribution of a fixed percentage of the fair market value of the trust. Again 
assuming a $100,000 trust balance and a 7 percent payout, you’ll receive 
a $7,000 distribution. But if the trust earns $12,000 in income, its value 
will increase to $105,000 after the distribution. The following year you’ll 
receive $7,350 (7 percent of $105,000).
 
 The charitable lead trust (CLT) or reverse charitable remainder trust: 
Instead of receiving income during your lifetime, with the remainder 
of the trust eventually going to charity, you instead direct the trust’s 
income to charity, and your heirs inherit the remainder upon your 
death. You avoid capital gains tax and enjoy income tax deductions for 
the continuing contributions during your lifetime.
Consider, for example, a stock investment that has appreciated substan-
tially. Your $10,000 investment is now worth $200,000. You place the stock 
into a charitable remainder annuity trust, receiving an income of $15,000 per 
year from the trust. Or consider an apartment building you purchased for 
$100,000 that is now worth millions. If you transfer the apartment building 
into a charitable remainder trust, you can sell the building within the trust, 
the trust will invest the proceeds, and you receive an income from the trust. 
The trust pays no capital gains tax. When you die, the charity or charities 
you designate receive the balance of the trust.
Your charitable remainder trust must make distributions of at least 5 percent 
of its net value per year, although you can defer income as long as the net 
distributions meet the 5 percent minimum. One useful approach is to set up 
the trust before you retire, deferring income for several years, and then aug-
menting your income with larger distributions (and thus catching up with the 
5 percent minimum) once you retire. You can incorporate a condition that, 

171
 Chapter 12: Dead or Alive: Picking Your Trust
once payments are caught up, your trust becomes a standard CRUT. If you 
die before catching up, the trust’s value at the time of your death is treated 
as part of your taxable estate, but your estate gets an offsetting charitable 
deduction from the donation of the trust’s assets to charity.
Setting too high a payout will affect your charitable income tax deduction, 
and can potentially reduce the principal balance of the trust.
 
A charitable remainder trust is irrevocable. Once you make your gift, you can’t 
take it back. However, you can give yourself the authority to change the chari-
table beneficiaries of the trust during your lifetime. In some circumstances, 
you can also serve as trustee.
Trusts to avoid gift taxes: Crummey trusts
If you want to make gifts to your heirs during your lifetime, you can take 
advantage of your $12,000 annual gift tax exclusion, giving gifts up to that 
amount to each of your heirs without worrying about gift tax exposure. If 
your spouse joins in the gifting plan, you can each make a gift, doubling the 
potential gift to $24,000 per year.
With a few years of giving, you can pass a great deal of money to your heirs, 
no strings attached. Once your gift is complete, the money is theirs to do 
with as they like. But what if you want to add some strings? Then you need to 
consider a Crummey trust, a form of irrevocable trust.
After creating the trust on behalf of your beneficiary:
 
 You make your annual gifts into the Crummey trust instead of making 
them directly to the beneficiary, informing your beneficiary of the gift.
 
 The beneficiary has a limited amount of time to withdraw the money 
from the trust. This right of withdrawal qualifies as a present interest in 
the gift, qualifying you for the gift tax exclusion.
 
 After the window for withdrawal expires, the beneficiary can no longer 
withdraw the gift, and it’s managed and distributed pursuant to the 
terms of the trust.
But wait a second. If your beneficiary has the right to take out the money 
after you make your gift, how will you prevent them from simply taking the 
money out as soon as you make a deposit? Well, you can’t. But what you can 
do is make it clear that the day your beneficiary withdraws the gift is the 
day you stop contributing to the trust. Even if you’re not contributing a full 
$12,000 per year, most beneficiaries will leave the money alone when they 
realize how much money they stand to lose.

172
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
 
You can set up your Crummey trust to have multiple beneficiaries, which sim-
plifies your annual gifting strategy by making all your gifts in a single transac-
tion with the trust. You don’t have to contribute cash. You can make gifts of 
stocks, bonds, other securities, or other types of property.
Trusts for people who receive government 
benefits: Special needs trusts
Recipients of public assistance typically have limits to the amount of income 
and assets they may have. If they have too much money, their benefits are 
reduced or terminated until their assets are depleted. A bequest to an heir 
who has a disability can be quickly depleted by the costs of residential care 
or medical bills.
At the same time, the cash benefits received through public assistance pro-
grams are quite low. Your heir may not have enough money for items that 
the government doesn’t provide, but which can significantly improve quality 
of life, such as over-the-counter medications, books and magazines, certain 
dental care, soap, and shampoo.
The special needs trust, also known as a supplemental needs trust, is designed 
to help you improve your beneficiary’s quality of life without jeopardizing 
their public assistance benefits. You place assets into the trust and appoint 
a trustee to manage the assets on behalf of the beneficiary. The trust isn’t 
considered to be part of the beneficiary’s estate and thus doesn’t jeopardize 
their benefits.
Distributions from the trust are often modest, supplementing the beneficiary’s 
care as opposed to providing for the support of the beneficiary. The trust lan-
guage is customized to the circumstances of your beneficiary and provides spe-
cific examples of the types of supplemental care to be provided from the trust.
 
The beneficiary of a special needs trust may not serve as trustee. The amount 
of distributions made from the trust needs to be carefully determined based 
upon the beneficiary’s situation so as not to jeopardize or reduce their con-
tinuing benefits. When creating a special needs trust, it’s advisable not just to 
get professional assistance, but to enlist the help of an estate planning profes-
sional who has special expertise in drafting these trusts.
Trusts to protect your estate plan if you 
predecease your spouse: Bypass trusts
If you have a large estate and expect to pay estate taxes, you can take some 
comfort in the unlimited exemption from estate taxes for gifts to your spouse. 

173
 Chapter 12: Dead or Alive: Picking Your Trust
But what happens when your spouse dies? Your spouse’s estate takes advan-
tage of the personal exemption from estate taxes, presently $2 million, and 
the balance of the estate is taxed.
A bypass trust is designed to allow both you and your spouse to take full advan-
tage of the personal exemption. You create a bypass trust to hold up to $2 mil-
lion of your separate assets and leave the balance of your estate to your spouse. 
When your spouse dies, the money in your bypass trust isn’t counted toward 
your spouse’s estate. Your spouse’s estate takes its separate $2 million exemp-
tion, and you’ve doubled the amount of money that is exempt from taxes.
You may be thinking that this process is unnecessarily complicated. Why 
not just give away $2 million in assets from your estate instead of creating a 
bypass trust? Here are two leading reasons:
 
 You may not have such a large estate that your spouse will be financially 
secure after $2 million in assets are removed from the estate.
 
 Your spouse can draw an income from the bypass trust, and you can 
allow your spouse access to the principal of the trust as necessary to 
pay for her support and medical care.
Your spouse can serve as trustee and may even be granted authority to 
change the beneficiaries of the trust. You can set up the trust to maximize 
the amount of income and benefit to your spouse (a maximum benefits bypass 
trust), or you can limit the benefits to your spouse to maximize the eventual 
inheritance by the trust’s beneficiaries.
The A/B trust
A bypass trust is commonly implemented through an A/B trust, jointly created 
by you and your spouse. That name refers to the fact that upon the death of 
you or your spouse, your marital estate is divided between two trusts:
 
 The B trust is the bypass trust. It contains the lesser of:
 
• The amount of the current estate tax exemption
 
• All your separate property, plus half of your community property
 
 The A trust (also called the survivor’s trust) holds the rest of the marital 
estate
Your spouse’s use of the A trust isn’t restricted. Your spouse can benefit 
from the B trust as previously described, and the trust’s assets eventually 
pass to your beneficiaries free of estate taxes.
The A/B/C trust
If you’re extremely wealthy, you can create a third trust upon your death. 
The most common approach is for the third trust to be a qualified terminable 
interest property trust (QTIP), described later in this chapter. After fully 

174
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
funding the bypass trust, you place the rest of your separate assets in the 
QTIP trust instead of putting them into your spouse’s survivor’s trust. The 
QTIP trust doesn’t provide further tax savings, but it allows you to continue 
to control and direct your assets rather than having them become part of 
your spouse’s estate.
Trusts where you control the trust assets
Although most often when you create an irrevocable trust, you lose most 
or all control over the trust’s assets, that’s not always the case. Some trusts 
permit you to get significant benefits from the assets.
Grantor trusts (GRATs, GRITs, and GRUTs)
Here’s a quick rundown of the acronyms:
 
 GRIT: Grantor retained income trust
 
 GRAT: Grantor retained annuity trust
 
 GRUT: Grantor retained unitrust
What does it mean to be grantor retained? It means that although you’re creat-
ing an irrevocable trust, you retain the right to receive income from the trust 
for a period of years. At the end of the trust’s life, the assets are distributed 
to your beneficiaries.
Until 1990, GRITs were a common tool for planning large estates. You’d trans-
fer property into your trust. For gift tax purposes, the value of the property 
within the trust would be discounted from its fair market value due to your 
continued claim on the income generated by the trust. The assets might 
appreciate substantially over the life of the trust, but taxes would continue to 
be based upon that initial valuation.
Does that sound too good to be true? The government thought so as well 
and, in 1990, wiped out the GRIT except in the limited form of the qualified 
personal residence trust (QPRT).
But estate planning lawyers are clever and weren’t about to let go of a good 
thing. So they figured out how to preserve some of these benefits:
 
 A GRAT allows you to transfer an asset into an irrevocable trust and 
receive an annual payment from the trust.
 
 A GRUT allows you to transfer an asset into an irrevocable trust and receive 
a distribution of a specified percentage of the trust’s assets each year.
At the end of the trust term, the assets are distributed to your beneficiaries.

175
 Chapter 12: Dead or Alive: Picking Your Trust
When would you use a GRAT or GRUT? If you have an asset that is appreciat-
ing at a rate higher than the annual rate of return expected by the IRS. For 
example, if you purchased Google stock in 2004 at $100 per share, that stock 
has more than quadrupled in value over four years. Had you put the stock 
into a GRAT or GRUT, the value of the gift would have been calculated based 
upon the IRS’s presumed annual rate of return, which at the time was less 
than 5 percent. You pay gift tax based on that lower valuation, but your heirs 
receive the full benefit of your gift.
Qualified personal residence trusts (QPRTs)
A qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) allows you to give away your 
house at a substantially reduced value, even though you continue to live in it. 
This trust can provide substantial estate tax savings. But QPRTs are irrevo-
cable trusts, and their use isn’t risk-free.
Ideally, your home will not be mortgaged when you create your QPRT. Once 
your property is transferred into the QPRT, you can’t refinance it.
If your home is mortgaged, normally the value of the gift will be treated as the 
net value of your home (market value less the balance of the mortgage). You 
continue to make the mortgage payments and may tax an income tax deduc-
tion for your interest payments. Your contributions to the principal balance 
of the mortgage are additional gifts to the grantees, so you must consider 
possible gift tax consequences. In an alternative approach, you transfer your 
home into the trust at its market value and assume personal responsibility 
for the mortgage. You continue to enjoy the mortgage interest deduction, but 
your payments don’t have any gift tax consequences.
When you set up a QPRT:
 
 You create a trust and transfer your home into the trust.
 
 The trust holds the home for a term of years, as few or as many as you 
choose.
 
 During that time, you retain the right to live in your home, rent-free, for 
the duration of the trust.
 
 You continue to pay any mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, 
and costs of maintenance and repair.
 
 Capital improvements, such as an addition or a new swimming pool, are 
considered gifts to the trust, in the amount of their fair market value.
 
 At the end of the trust’s term, the trust beneficiaries receive ownership 
of your home. All appreciation in the value of the home following its 
transfer into the trust is free of gift and inheritance taxes.
In order to benefit from a QPRT you have to consider your probable life 
expectancy when you determine how long the trust will last. If you die before 
the trust expires, your home is treated as part of your estate. Your estate 

176
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
gets credit for any gift tax consequences from the original transfer of the 
home into your trust. The net effect is that you’re back where you started, as 
if you never created the QPRT.
If you’re alive at the end of the trust, your home passes to the beneficiaries 
of the trust. Your beneficiaries may permit you to continue to rent the home, 
but they don’t have to. At this point in time, it’s their home.
During the term of your QPRT, you have the right to sell your home and pur-
chase a different home. You have two years from the date of sale to purchase 
the new home. If your home is sold while it is in your QPRT and the proceeds 
of the sale aren’t used to purchase a new residence, the trust may similarly 
be converted to a GRAT (see preceding section).
 
A QPRT is only effective as long as you continue to reside in your home. If you 
move, the trustee can return ownership to you or convert the QPRT into a 
GRAT, described in the preceding section.
Trusts that own life insurance: Irrevocable 
life insurance trusts (ILITs)
An irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) allows you to pass life insurance pro-
ceeds to your heirs, tax-free. Here’s how it works.
 
 You create a trust and transfer sufficient assets into the trust to pur-
chase the desired life insurance policy. You can’t serve as trustee.
 
 Your trustee purchases a life insurance policy of the type and value you 
desire.
 
 Upon your death, the proceeds of the life insurance policy are paid into 
the ILIT and are managed and distributed according to the terms of the 
trust.
 
 As the life insurance proceeds are never part of your estate, no estate 
taxes are payable on those proceeds.
As with any irrevocable trust, you need to be careful in your selection of a 
trustee. Pick a trustee you are confident will follow your wishes in relation 
not only to the purchase of life insurance, but also when administering the 
trust after it receives the insurance proceeds.
If you transfer an existing life insurance policy into the ILIT, the proceeds of 
the policy will be included in your estate if you die within three years of the 
transfer.
You can incorporate elements of a Crummey trust, described earlier in this 
chapter, to provide annual contributions to your ILIT to cover the cost of 

177
 Chapter 12: Dead or Alive: Picking Your Trust
premiums while avoiding any gift tax consequences. As with any Crummey 
trust, you take the chance that your beneficiaries will withdraw the money, 
but the folly of doing so (and losing the benefit of the life insurance pro-
ceeds) is obvious.
 
These trusts can come under intense IRS scrutiny, so I urge you to have your 
ILIT drafted by a professional.
Trusts for multiple generations: Dynasty 
trusts (generation-skipping trusts)
A dynasty trust is a wealth management tool that provides for multiple genera-
tions of heirs, while avoiding estate taxes and generation-skipping transfer 
taxes. Taxes aren’t saved when the trust is created, but they are saved as 
wealth is distributed to later generations of beneficiaries. When properly 
created and funded, no federal gift or estate taxes are owed on distributions 
made at the following times:
 
 During your lifetime
 
 Following your death
 
 When the trust ends, and its remaining assets are distributed
If you create and fund a dynasty trust during your lifetime, your gift tax expo-
sure is the value of the assets you transfer into the trust. After the transfer, 
the assets appreciate without further gift or estate tax liability. You can also 
fund the trust at the time of your death, taking full advantage of the remain-
der of your unified gift and estate tax exemption.
Laws collectively known as the Rule Against Perpetuities limit the duration of 
a dynasty trust. Most often, these laws require that all trust assets be distrib-
uted within a life in being, plus 21 years, meaning within 21 years of the death 
of the last surviving named beneficiary of your trust. These laws vary by 
state, and their application can be exceedingly technical, so be careful.
Often, a dynasty trust will include spendthrift provisions to protect trust 
assets from claims by beneficiaries’ creditors or ex-spouses. Spendthrift 
trusts are described earlier in this chapter.
A dynasty trust may also be combined with an ILIT so that the trust is funded 
with tax-free life insurance proceeds.
 
You can easily fall into one of many potential traps that can destroy a dynasty 
trust, such as the rule against perpetuities. Dynasty trusts are subject to a 
high rate of taxation on trust income, meaning that you’ll get the most benefit 
from the trust if it’s funded with tax-free investments. Giving a beneficiary too 

178
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
much authority over trust assets can create gift tax liability on distributions. 
To avoid these and other pitfalls, this type of trust should be created by an 
experienced professional.
Trusts to postpone estate taxes: 
Qualified terminable interest 
property trusts (QTIPs)
A qualified terminable interest property trust, or QTIP trust, is designed to 
help married people leave assets to their heirs, while delaying the payment 
of gift and estate taxes. The QTIP trust is often used to protect inheritances 
intended for children from a prior marriage, as the trust’s assets never 
become part of your surviving spouse’s estate and are ultimately distributed 
according to your instructions.
Your QTIP trust is created upon your death. As long as your spouse remains 
alive, the trust property may not be distributed to anybody other than your 
spouse. Although your spouse doesn’t directly receive the trust assets, gift 
and estate taxes are deferred until the death of your spouse.
Your surviving spouse will receive all of the trust’s income and may some-
times also use the trust’s assets, but you can impose significant limits on 
your spouse’s ability to access and control the trust’s assets. The trust’s 
assets are also shielded from your spouse’s creditors.
When your spouse dies, taxes are paid, and the trust’s assets are distributed 
consistent with the terms of the trust instrument.
 
If you intend to create a QTIP trust, you need to be absolutely sure that your 
executor knows how to make a timely QTIP election following your death or 
have your probate lawyer ready to step in. If your estate makes a mistake or 
misses the deadline for making a QTIP election, your estate may lose all of the 
benefits of this trust.
Trusts for your pet
 
You expect to outlive your beloved pet, so how do you make sure that your 
pet is properly cared for? An increasingly popular way is to make your pet the 
beneficiary of a trust. (A sample trust instrument is available on the CD.)
Most states now formally recognize your ability to create a trust for your pet, 
and that number is growing. In the remaining states, your pet trust is non-
binding and may potentially be set aside if challenged in court.

179
 Chapter 12: Dead or Alive: Picking Your Trust
You may have heard that Leona Helmsley left $12 million to her dog, Trouble. 
When the dog dies, any remaining balance will go into her charitable trust. 
She left the care of her dog to a family friend, and many other people have an 
incentive to see that the money isn’t misused. Most pets aren’t that lucky.
 
The biggest safeguard for your pet, and perhaps the only safeguard, is your 
choice of a suitable trustee. Your pet can’t complain about mistreatment, 
abuse, or neglect or monitor or report misuse of trust assets. In states where 
the trustee isn’t bound to the terms of your trust, nothing may stop your 
trustee from simply pocketing the money.
Although you can use an institutional trustee or have the trust pay for peri-
odic investigation of your pet’s living conditions, in most cases, that route 
will not be cost-effective.
Deciding Which Trust Is Right for You
You can choose from many different types of trust, some of them very spe-
cialized, and combine them in interesting and innovative ways. For special-
ized needs, particularly if cost isn’t an issue, the range of choices can seem 
endless. If cost is an issue, be careful. Some trusts are expensive to set up, 
and some are very expensive to administer.
Where does that leave you? If you’ve read this chapter, you’re a lot more 
informed about your options, but what do you actually need? For some 
people, the answer is nothing. For most others, a simple revocable living 
trust is sufficient. For you? The following sections help you figure that out.
Serving your personal needs
When you’re trying to take care of yourself, the revocable living trust is prob-
ably your first and best choice. Why?
 
 You pick your own trustee.
 
 Upon your incapacity, your trustee can assume responsibility for manag-
ing the assets of your trust.
 
 You define your trustee’s powers. They can be as narrow or as broad as 
you wish.
In contrast, if you have no plan for your incapacity, your estate may end up 
being managed by a court-appointed guardian or conservator in a manner the 
court deems suitable. (Chapter 14 contains a lot more information on inca-
pacity planning.)

180
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
A charitable remainder trust can offer you both a steady source of income 
and tax advantages during your lifetime.
 
You can utilize trusts as part of your business succession strategy to help you 
transfer business ownership to your successors. Chapter 4 discusses business 
succession in more detail.
Serving the needs of your family
Most trusts are designed to benefit your heirs, and it thus follows that most 
trusts can be set up to serve the needs of your family. The issue is more one 
of specialization. What are the specific needs of your family members, and 
what trusts will serve those needs?
Minor and dependent children
Most trusts can include provisions governing the distribution of your gifts to 
your children. Common trust provisions benefiting children:
 
 Place the children’s assets under the supervision of a responsible trustee
 
 Defer part or all of their inheritance until they reach adulthood, or provide 
for gifts to be received in periodic installments after they reach adulthood
 
 Provide for the children’s support and education during their minority, 
perhaps also providing for college expenses
You can implement these provisions through your revocable living trust or 
even through a testamentary trust that is created and funded at the time of 
your death.
Chapter 5 contains more suggestions for providing for your children.
Disabled dependents
The most useful trust for a recipient of public assistance is a special needs 
trust, described earlier in this chapter. This type of trust pays for modest com-
forts of life that your beneficiary probably will not otherwise be able to afford.
You can find more information on special needs planning in Chapter 5.
Second marriages
If you’re worried about keeping your assets out of your combined marital 
estate or providing for your new spouse’s financial well-being while protect-
ing your children’s inheritances, how creative do you want to be?

181
 Chapter 12: Dead or Alive: Picking Your Trust
 
 You can place your assets into a revocable living trust before you marry 
to keep them separate from the marital estate, perhaps also executing 
a prenuptial agreement, whereby your new spouse waives any claim to 
trust assets.
 
 You can use bypass trusts and their A/B variants to provide for the sup-
port of your spouse, while ensuring that your children from a prior mar-
riage receive a considerable inheritance.
 
 You can place your assets in trust, allowing your spouse to benefit from 
them for a specified number of years before they’re distributed to your 
children. For example, you can provide for your second spouse to live 
in your home for seven years after your death, but anticipate that after 
that time, your spouse will have recovered financially and perhaps be in 
a new relationship, such that your children should inherit your home.
 
 You can create an ILIT to provide life insurance benefits to your chil-
dren, while leaving the bulk of your estate to your spouse.
That’s just scraping the surface of the many trusts that can help you struc-
ture your assets for the long-term benefit of your selected heirs.
Financially irresponsible beneficiaries
If your beneficiaries aren’t good with money, have troubled marriages, or 
don’t have a long enough track record with money that you’re comfortable 
leaving them large bequests, you can utilize a spendthrift trust to limit their 
access to their inheritance and also to shield it from creditors and legal 
claims.
 
Spendthrift trust provisions may be added to most trusts. So pick the trusts 
that will distribute your assets the way you want and then look into adding 
spendthrift provisions.
Thinking about the tax man
Throughout this chapter, I discuss trusts that can help you save taxes, par-
ticularly estate taxes, gift taxes, and capital gains taxes. The most effective 
trusts for avoiding taxes are
 
 Irrevocable: Once your money goes in, it stays in.
 
 Complicated: A trust may seem deceptively simple, but the devil is in 
the details, and small mistakes can erase tax benefits.
 
 Cautious: To ensure compliance with tax laws, trusts shielding you from 
taxes are best drafted by an estate planning lawyer.

182
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
 
When I’m talking about estate taxes, I’m talking about estates worth millions 
of dollars. I’m talking about potential tax exposure of hundreds of thousands 
of dollars, or more. And I’m looking at state and federal tax agencies that want 
your money and may seek to invalidate your trust in order to get it.
Being wealthy doesn’t mean that you like to pay money to lawyers. It prob-
ably means that you’re careful with your money and avoid unnecessary 
expenses.
Yes, by reading this chapter, you can get a good idea of the trusts that can 
benefit you. You can try to create those trusts yourself. But you’ll save a 
lot of time and aggravation by getting a professional to help you choose, 
draft, and fund your trusts. And when you use estate planning professionals, 
you have the reassurance that if they make a mistake you can make a claim 
against their firm or malpractice insurance coverage.
Taxes are discussed more fully in Chapter 6. Common tax traps are outlined 
in Chapter 20.

Chapter 13
When You Already Have a Trust
In This Chapter
 Putting assets into your trust
 Updating your trust
 Revoking your trust
A
fter you draft your trust (see Chapters 11 and 12), you still have more 
work to do. You need to put money and assets into your trust. You 
need to periodically review your living trust and change it if it’s no longer 
consistent with your estate planning goals. At times, you may even need to 
revoke your trust.
Creating the Trust Isn’t 
the End of the Story
If you’re using a living trust as part of your estate, the goals of your trust 
probably include incapacity planning and avoiding probate. If you’re using 
other trusts, your goals are most likely to avoid taxes, plan for the succession 
of your business, provide for a disabled relative, or protect your beneficiaries 
from creditors or bad financial choices.
To ensure that your wishes are carried out, you must
 
 Fund your trust, by transferring into the trust the assets you want it to 
hold, manage, and ultimately distribute
 
 Periodically review your revocable trusts to confirm that they remain 
consistent with your estate planning goals and wishes
 
Even with all the benefits of a trust, putting all your assets into one isn’t 
realistic — and may not even be desirable. Trusts also don’t communicate 
your wishes to a probate court. Even if you have a sound, comprehensive 
trust, you also need to have a will.

184
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
Transferring Assets into Your Trust
You know the advantages of creating a trust. You’ve drafted your trust and 
signed the trust agreement. But you’re not done yet. Now you must transfer 
assets into your trust.
Think of your brand new trust as a box. It’s carefully constructed to hold 
your assets just the way you want and to keep them safe. But no matter how 
carefully made, your trust starts out empty. It doesn’t hold any assets until 
you put them into it.
 
Anything you choose not to transfer into your trust will remain part of your 
estate, and the distribution of those assets will normally occur through a pro-
bate court.
When transferring assets into your trust, the first question you face is one of 
timing:
 
 You can transfer assets into your trust during your lifetime.
 
 You can use your will to transfer assets into your trust.
A will that puts estate assets into an existing trust is called a pour over will. 
You can also use your will to create a testamentary trust, a new trust created 
by your will to hold specified assets.
Real estate
The transfer of real estate is usually the most complicated transaction when 
funding a trust. To transfer real estate, take the following steps:
 
1. Execute and file a quitclaim deed transferring title of the real estate 
from yourself to the trust.
 
 If you want to transfer your interest in real estate that has multiple 
owners, all owners must cooperate in this process.
 
2. Update your insurance policies to reflect that your trust is now the 
owner of the real estate.
 
 You may need to obtain a new title insurance policy.
 
3. Lease your real estate back from your trust.
 
 This step, however, isn’t necessary if you have a revocable living 
trust.

185
 Chapter 13: When You Already Have a Trust
 
If your real estate has a mortgage, review the language of the mortgage before 
transferring the real estate into a trust. Your mortgage may include a due 
on sale clause that will be triggered by the transfer, requiring you to pay off 
the mortgage balance. Get your lender’s consent before you transfer the real 
estate. Fortunately, these clauses don’t apply when you transfer your primary 
residence into your own revocable living trust.
If you’re transferring your primary residence into your own revocable living 
trust, don’t worry about homestead exemptions or tax valuations, as a trans-
fer into your own living trust won’t affect your exemptions or tax assessment. 
For other real estate or transfers into other types of trusts, be sure to consider 
the tax consequences of transfer, including reassessment and transfer taxes.
Financial accounts
If you want to transfer a bank account, money market account, or brokerage 
account into your trust, the simplest process is for the trust to open a new 
account and then transfer the account balances from the old account into the 
new account. If you prefer to transfer the existing account, contact your bank 
or brokerage for the required forms.
To transfer securities held in your own name (for example, stocks and 
bonds) into your trust, you will have to identify the transfer agent for the 
security. The transfer agent will provide you with paperwork to complete. 
You will return the completed paperwork with your certificates, and the 
transfer agent will reissue the certificates in the name of the trust.
Forgetting to fund a trust
Believe it or not, even estate planning profes-
sionals sometimes forget to fund a trust. I recall 
a case where a large law firm had drafted an 
elegant trust that carefully laid out its client’s 
estate plan, but neglected to transfer so much 
as a penny into the trust.
What happened? The client’s estate was dis-
tributed pursuant to a will that predated the trust 
and did not fully reflect the client’s wishes.
The law firm was sued for malpractice, but that 
didn’t undo the damage. Faced with substantial 
legal costs, and the difficulty of proving both 
what the deceased client would have trans-
ferred into the trust and how the transfer would 
have affected her heirs’ inheritances, the estate 
accepted a modest settlement.

186
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
 
You will not ordinarily transfer your personal checking accounts into your 
trust. Doing so needlessly complicates your day-to-day financial transactions.
Other assets
If you want to make your trust the beneficiary of a life insurance policy, annu-
ity, or retirement account, contract the company that issued the policy or 
holds the account for change of beneficiary forms.
You can transfer items of personal property to your trust by executing an 
assignment or bill of sale, conveying the property to your trust.
 
Normally, you will not transfer your vehicles, boats, or furniture into your 
trust. Obtaining car insurance for a vehicle owned by a trust may be costly 
or difficult.
Reviewing Your Trust
You should review your revocable living trust every year, along with the rest 
of your estate plan. If that’s too much for you, try not to go more than two 
or three years without revisiting your trust. Over time, it’s inevitable that 
your life, and thus your estate plan, will change. For example, you’ll have 
new heirs, you may want to reduce or eliminate certain gifts, or heirs will die. 
Your trustee may pass away or may no longer be a suitable choice. There 
may be changes in your estate or in the law that affect the distribution of 
property. To keep your trust effective and out of probate court, you need to 
keep it up to date.
Common changes include
 
 Adding or removing beneficiaries
 
 Designating a different trustee or successor trustee
 
 Designating beneficiaries for an asset you’ve added to the trust
 
 Changing the distribution of trust assets
Does the trust still serve your needs?
You may have drafted your trust to address specific estate planning needs, 
but later find that your needs have changed. For example:

187
 Chapter 13: When You Already Have a Trust
 
 Your trust provides extensively for the management of your business in 
the event of your incapacity or death, but you have since sold your busi-
ness or transferred ownership to your successors.
 
 The most significant asset in your trust was your home, but you have 
since sold your home to move into a condo or retirement community.
In most cases, if you conclude that you’ll benefit from a living trust, you will 
continue to benefit from having a trust even as your needs change. But you 
may need to substantially revise or rewrite your trust to reflect changes in 
your needs.
Does the trust still fulfill your goals?
At various stages in your life, you may have different goals that you want to 
achieve through your estate plan. As time goes by, your needs and those of 
your family will change. These changes may occur in countless ways. For 
example:
 
 Your trust carefully plans how you’ll provide for your minor children, 
pay for their education, and distribute an inheritance to them during 
their early adulthood. Now, though, they’ve finished school and are 
adults, and you’re still alive and kicking.
 
 Since you drafted your trust, your eldest daughter has developed a drug 
dependency. Previously, you were going to simply leave her a lump 
sum of money, but now you want to protect her inheritance from being 
squandered on drugs or lost to bill collectors.
 
 When you entered your second marriage, you carefully structured your 
trust to maintain certain assets as separate property in case of divorce. 
But now you’re not worried about divorce, and you want to be more 
generous with your spouse in your estate plan.
Through the periodic review of your estate plan, you can identify changes in 
your goals and amend your trust to reflect your current wishes.
Changing the name of your trust
Many people name their revocable living trusts 
after themselves. But what if you change your 
name? Do you have to change the name of your 
trust? The short answer is no. Your trust will 
remain effective under your old name.
If you want to change the name of your trust 
anyway, remember that you must also change 
the ownership of trust assets to reflect the new 
name of the trust. This process may involve 
quite a bit of paperwork, but isn’t too difficult.

188
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
Is the trust adequately funded?
Changes in your estate may leave your trust without the assets you expected 
it to hold.
 
 Financial setbacks may deplete your savings or investments.
 
 You may have sold the house that was once the principal trust asset so 
that you could move into a smaller home or retirement community.
 
 Other trust assets may have been lost, sold, or destroyed.
When you’re unable to fund the trust as you originally intended or reductions 
in its assets frustrate its purpose, you need to consider whether to amend or 
revoke the trust or to transfer additional assets into the trust.
Amending Your Trust
After you review your estate plan, you may want to change certain provisions 
of your revocable living trust. Fortunately, amending a trust is relatively easy 
(unless, of course, it’s an irrevocable trust, which you can’t change). You can 
execute an amendment to the trust, completely rewrite the trust, or, in some 
cases, revoke the trust and transfer its assets back to yourself.
 
Adding new property to a living trust shouldn’t require amendment. A well-
drafted trust anticipates that you’ll continue to add property to the trust over 
your lifetime.
Your approach to amendment may be affected by the simplicity or com-
plexity of the changes you want to make. For smaller changes, a simple 
amendment may suffice. For more complicated changes, you may choose to 
completely rewrite the trust or even to revoke it.
 
If you’ve registered your trust with a government office or probate court, 
remember to also register your amendments.
If you want to change your trust, keep the following points in mind:
 
 You can amend your trust by executing a supplemental document that 
changes the terms of the existing trust instrument.
 
 You can restate the trust, replacing the entire old trust with new trust 
language. Restatement will normally void all previous amendments to 
your trust.
 
 You can revoke the trust and transfer its assets back to yourself. If you 
choose, you can later create a new trust for some or all of those assets.

189
 Chapter 13: When You Already Have a Trust
 
Don’t try to change your trust by less formal means, such as by crossing off 
language or writing notes in the margins. Similarly, don’t attempt to remove a 
page from a trust and replace it with an updated page. You may render part or 
all of your trust invalid, create confusion as to your intent, or trigger litigation 
over whether the changes were in fact made by you.
After amending your trust, you may refer to the trust by the date of the 
most recent amendment (for example, The Jones Revocable Living Trust, As 
Amended On July 14, 2009).
Restating a Trust
When you restate a revocable trust, although the trust continues to hold its 
assets, you create an entirely new trust instrument to govern the operation of 
the trust and eventual distribution of its assets. (You can’t restate an irrevo-
cable trust.) This approach to amendment has several advantages:
 
 If you’re making substantial changes to your trust, referring back and 
forth between the amendment and the original language can be compli-
cated and confusing.
 
 If you amend your trust more than once, subsequent amendments may 
also affect prior amendments, adding to the complication and possible 
confusion.
 
 Sometimes trust language may become dated or irrelevant or may not 
reflect changes in the law. Restatement allows you to clean house.
 
 Due to the complexities, it’s often easier to restate a trust than to amend 
it. If you’re using a lawyer, restating your trust may also be cheaper.
After restating your trust, you may refer to the trust by the date of the 
restatement (for example, The Smith Revocable Living Trust, As Restated On 
July 14, 2009).
What if you have an irrevocable trust?
You can’t change or revoke an irrevocable trust. 
Once you create the trust and transfer assets 
into it, the deal is done.
The obvious response to this revelation is, “Why 
create an irrevocable trust in the first place?” 
The leading purpose of irrevocable trusts is tax 
planning and tax avoidance, and those goals 
often require that you surrender both owner-
ship and control of the trust’s assets. Despite 
the loss of control, the capital gains tax and 
estate tax savings to yourself and your heirs 
may be substantial.

190
Part III: Trust Me! How Trusts Work 
Revoking a Trust
When you create a revocable trust, as may seem obvious, you reserve to 
yourself the power to revoke it at any time. But before you revoke your trust, 
consider your continuing estate planning goals.
 
 When your revoke your trust, you must transfer ownership of all trust 
assets back to yourself. If you intend to create a new revocable living 
trust, you will save yourself a lot of work by amending or restating the 
trust.
 
 Restatement reduces the chance that you will accidentally forget to 
transfer an asset back into the trust — it’s already there.
 
If you create a revocable living trust during your marriage or jointly with your 
spouse, you will want to revoke the trust upon divorce.
When a trust is revocable, as long as you remain competent, you may revoke 
your trust. You may even provide within a revocable trust that in the event of 
your incapacity, your trustee may revoke the trust.
Even when you create a living trust with your spouse, you can unilaterally 
revoke the trust. This step returns ownership of trust assets to you and your 
spouse, in the manner in which they were owned before you created the trust.
The process of revoking a trust is relatively simple:
 
1. Transfer ownership of the trust assets out of the trust and back to 
yourself.
 
2. Execute a revocation of living trust form and keep it with your legal 
documents.
If you’ve distributed copies of your trust to your trustee or any other people, 
you may want to inform them of the revocation and recover those copies.
What Happens If You Die?
Once you die, your trustee will manage and distribute trust assets pursuant to 
the terms of your trust. (If something happens to your trustee, your successor 
trustee will take over, or a probate court will appoint a successor.) That may 
mean immediately distributing your estate, or it may mean holding your assets 
for years while making periodic distributions of assets or trust income.
This process ordinarily occurs independently of the probate court, meaning 
that no public record of your trust exists.

191
 Chapter 13: When You Already Have a Trust
Can you avoid probate?
The principal benefit of a revocable living trust is probate avoidance. The 
assets within your trust don’t become part of your probate estate. But you 
can’t completely avoid the probate court.
 
 No matter how many of your assets are held by your trust, there will 
always be some assets that aren’t included. It’s cumbersome to have 
your trust own certain assets, such as automobiles. You also have the 
risk that an asset wasn’t properly transferred into the trust and remains 
part of your estate.
 
 Somebody has to prepare your final income tax returns and estate tax 
returns. The assets in your living trust are counted toward your estate 
when calculating estate taxes.
 
 You will have some property that isn’t owned by your trust, even if they’re 
only your clothes, personal effects, and the money in your wallet.
The probate court will oversee the final accounting of your estate, submis-
sion of tax returns and payment of taxes, and the distribution of any assets 
that aren’t included in your trust. Your trust should make the probate pro-
cess a lot faster and cheaper, but you can’t completely avoid the probate 
court.
Should you also have a will?
Even if you have a trust, you absolutely should have a will as well. Your will 
is the failsafe tool for your estate plan, governing distribution of your assets 
when something else goes wrong. Having a will also has other benefits:
 
 Through your will, you pick the personal representative of your estate.
 
 If you have minor children, you use your will to designate your preferred 
caretakers for your children and their assets.
 
 Your will describes how any assets remaining in your estate will be 
distributed among your heirs. You’re probably not concerned about 
your clothing undergarments, but what about your wedding ring? The 
balance of your checking and savings accounts? The brokerage account 
you forgot to transfer into your trust?
 
If you don’t have a will, the court will choose the administrator of your estate 
and won’t know your wishes when appointing guardians for your children. 
Anything that remains in your estate will pass according to your state’s laws 
of intestate succession.

his part explains why you need to plan for your 
incapacity, and the benefits of creating a durable 
power of attorney, healthcare proxy, and living will. You 
find out how retirement accounts and life insurance figure

A
s a result of age, illness, or accident, you may find yourself still alive 
but unable to care for yourself or make decisions. The good news is 
that you can help yourself and reduce the stress on your family by document-
ing your wishes and selecting people who will act on your behalf before — if 
ever — you’re incapacitated. In this chapter, I talk about living wills, health-
care proxies, and financial powers of attorney, which all can help you plan 
for your incapacity.
Planning for Incapacity 
Has Many Benefits
Why do you need to plan for incapacity? You probably already know the 
answer:
 
 Aging is unavoidable. We’re all growing older, and with advanced age 
comes the risk that you’ll lose your physical and mental capacity.
 
 Illnesses are unavoidable. While most illnesses are followed by a full 
recovery, some result in temporary or permanent incapacity.
 
 Accidents are unavoidable. While most accidents are minor, disaster 
can strike anyone at any age.
You’re reading this chapter, so you’ve already done the hardest part of inca-
pacity planning: recognizing that bad things can happen to you. Now you 
can take the steps necessary to ease the burden on yourself and your family, 
should disaster strike.

196
Par t IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
You avoid guardianship and 
conservatorship proceedings
 
A healthcare proxy (healthcare power of attorney) identifies a trusted person 
as your medical advocate who can make medical decisions on your behalf 
when you’re unable to do so yourself. If you don’t create a healthcare proxy, 
when a medical crisis arises or your health deteriorates, your family may have 
to go to court in order to obtain guardianship over you. Similarly, without 
a durable power of attorney, your family may have to petition the court to 
appoint a conservator (sometimes called a guardian of the estate) to manage 
your money and property. The people chosen by the court may not be the 
people you prefer, people you find objectionable, or even complete strangers. 
Your estate will bear the cost of court proceedings and may have to pay fees 
to the people managing your care and your assets during your period of dis-
ability or, if you don’t recover, the rest of your life.
You get to choose who cares for you
When you execute a healthcare proxy and durable power of attorney — the docu-
ment that authorizes somebody to manage your legal and financial affairs — you 
get to select the people who hold those powers. You can be reasonably certain 
that the people you select will respect your wishes. These individuals are autho-
rized to act on your behalf without seeking court approval or providing reports 
or accountings to a court. Although bond requirements can often be waived, the 
holder of your financial power of attorney does not have to post a bond as a 
condition of providing that service.
Don’t let fear of probate court dictate your choices
Having a healthcare proxy and durable power of 
attorney will allow most people to avoid probate 
proceedings relating to their incapacity. But if 
you lack the time to complete those documents, 
or do not know who to designate to represent 
your interests, the probate court is there to 
protect you. Guardianship and conservatorship 
proceedings are relatively straightforward, and 
are often initiated by people who care about 
you. Court-appointed guardians and conserva-
tors act subject to judicial oversight, and submit 
periodic reports and accountings to the court to 
document their actions.

197
 Chapter 14: Planning for Your Incapacity
 
If you’re in a domestic partnership and become ill or incapacitated, healthcare 
providers and financial institutions may treat your partner as if you have no 
family relationship. Difficulties can arise even if your state permits registered 
domestic partnerships, particularly during travel to other parts of the country. 
A healthcare proxy and financial power of attorney can keep your partner in 
the picture.
You ensure that your wishes are followed
When you create a living will, healthcare proxy, or financial power of attorney, 
you get to
 
 Nominate somebody you trust: You pick the people who will be assisting 
you with your choices or making choices on your behalf.
 
 Grant powers: You describe what authority you want to grant over your 
property and your person.
 
 Define limits: You define the limits on the choices that these appointees 
can make.
These three documents help ensure that your wishes for your property and 
personal care are respected.
Drafting a Living Will
An advance directive is a document that provides instructions for what you 
want to happen in the future if you become unable to make or communicate 
your own decisions. A complete estate plan includes an advance medical direc-
tive, also known as a living will. Your living will describes the care you desire and 
the limits you want to place on your care during the final stages of your life.
Living wills provide instructions for your medical care when you’re unable to 
speak for yourself. A typical living will addresses situations where you have a 
terminal illness or are in a permanent vegetative state or coma.
If you have a living will, your loved ones don’t have to guess your wishes or 
argue over what course of treatment they believe you would choose. In the 
Terry Schiavo case, a woman’s husband and parents battled for years over 
whether she should be kept alive with a feeding tube. Their dispute dragged 
through the courts and ended up broadcast in the national media. Although 

198
Par t IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
media coverage is unlikely, litigation over medical care options is not uncom-
mon. You can help avoid this type of conflict by having a living will that 
describes your actual wishes.
Contrary to popular belief, a living will can do more than help you avoid 
being kept alive against your wishes. You can describe what treatments you 
desire to receive and even request the maximum level of intervention con-
sistent with medical standards of practice. For example, you can state that if 
you’re not expected to recover from an illness, you don’t want to be placed 
on life support or fed through a feeding tube. Or if you wish, you can state 
that you want your life extended through life support and intubation. You can 
use your living will to request care and treatment that you believe will pro-
tect your comfort and dignity.
 
The most common situations where people require assistance making medical 
decisions, or require somebody to make decisions for them, do not come at 
the end of life. They involve patients who have lost capacity to understand 
their day-to-day needs and their treatment options, due to conditions such as 
Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. A living will does not help you in these cir-
cumstances. In those situations, you also need a healthcare proxy. (For more 
on this topic, see the section “Looking into Other Advance Directives,” later in 
this chapter.)
When your caregivers interpret your living will or decide which medical 
treatments are excluded by the living will, you always risk a misunderstand-
ing. You can help avoid misunderstanding by making sure that your family 
and caregivers understand what you want. (See the section in this chapter on 
“Discussing your wishes.”) You should also be careful to make your instruc-
tions clear. While a living will usually rules out treatment serving solely to 
prolong life, the same treatment may be justified on the basis that it will 
increase your comfort or has the potential to improve your level of con-
sciousness or ability to communicate with your family. When these ambigui-
ties arise, the person who holds your healthcare proxy can choose treatment 
options most likely to be consistent with your wishes.
The principal advantages of having a living will are as follows:
 
 Your wishes are known. In the event of a health crisis, your family can 
provide for your care without the stress of guessing what you would 
have wanted.
 
 Your wishes are clearly recorded. Although your doctor will follow 
your oral instructions, a living will reduces the chance of miscommuni-
cation and increases the likelihood that your wishes will be accurately 
conveyed to other medical providers.
 
 You get peace of mind. When you create a living will, your wishes are 
much more likely to be followed.

199
 Chapter 14: Planning for Your Incapacity
Discussing your wishes
After you put your pen to paper and recorded your wishes in a living will, you 
may think you’re done — but you’re not. Unless you discuss your living will 
with the people involved with your care, you risk that your wishes may be 
misinterpreted or ignored.
Don’t forget the following people when you discuss your living will:
 
 Your family: Of course, talk to your family about death. Even the young 
and healthy avoid these topics, thinking that they can be put off to 
the future. Yet even with a living will, the best way to ensure that your 
wishes are respected is to share them with your family and to address 
their concerns. You can’t anticipate every possible future, but your 
intentions are most likely to be followed if your family understands your 
values, wishes, and desired quality of life.
 
 You can expect that your family will want you to be comfortable and 
well cared for, but that doesn’t mean that they’ll want to make the deci-
sion to “pull the plug.” Your family may insist that your living will does 
not clearly state your wishes and argue for additional treatment despite 
your wishes. Although your doctors are obligated to follow your instruc-
tions instead of risking a confrontation, they may defer to your family’s 
demand for an expansive reading of the treatment authorized by your 
living will. (After all, they don’t want a lawsuit!) Discussing your wishes 
with your family makes it more likely that they will respect them.
 
 Your medical advocate: Even the best living wills can be ambiguous, 
and the holder of your healthcare proxy is the person authorized to 
clarify your intentions when you are no longer able. You want to be cer-
tain that your medical advocate understands your motives and goals for 
end-of-life care. By discussing your wishes with your medical advocate, 
you can both be confident that your wishes will be followed.
 
 Your doctor: Before you execute your living will, discuss your ideas with your
doctor. Your doctor can help ensure that healthcare professionals will 
Life-prolonging alternatives
Although your living will can be crafted to 
inform your caregivers of your wish to prolong 
your life, a common perception of the living 
will is that it’s about giving up care during your 
final days of life. Alternative documents, called 
will-to-live forms or life-prolonging procedures 
forms, focus on the continuation of care during 
your final days.
National Right to Life offers will-to-live forms on 
its Web site at www.nrlc.org. Under Issue 
Info click Euthanasia and look for the links 
under the heading Will to Live Project.

200
Par t IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
understand your instructions. If you have a medical condition, your 
doctor can talk to you about your treatment options so that you can decide 
whether you want to mandate a particular course of treatment. Your doctor 
may also alert you to provisions in your living will that may cause some health 
facilities to reject it. Although the issue doesn’t arise often and a medical 
facility should warn you on admission that they have moral objections to your 
living will, by that time, you may not be able to arrange for alternate care.
Executing a living will
 
The best starting place for creating a living will is to use a form that has been 
pre-approved for your state. You can also benefit from looking at living wills 
that, although not in the standard format, demonstrate how people modify 
that format to better reflect their wishes and desires. State living will forms 
and additional customized examples are provided on the accompanying CD. 
You can customize your living will to suit your needs.
To complete a standard-form living will, simply follow the instructions that 
accompany the form. You provide information about yourself and your wishes 
and then execute your living will in front of witnesses or a notary public.
 
Follow the witnessing instructions for your state. Most states require that two 
disinterested witnesses sign your living will, meaning that these witnesses 
should not have any stake in your medical care and should not be receiving 
anything from your estate. Your witnesses should also be adults who are com-
petent to testify in court. You can use a friend as a witness as long as they’re 
not inheriting anything from your estate.
Your living will is interpreted under the laws of the state where you receive 
medical care. Although in most cases state laws will be very similar, if you 
move to another state, you should review your living will.
Moral objections to living wills
Doctors may have moral or religious objections 
to carrying out the instructions in your living 
will. This situation is most likely to happen with 
end-of-life care where your living will describes 
treatment choices that the doctor sees as 
accelerating death. If you discuss your wishes 
with your doctor and your doctor objects to your 
choices, you may want to change doctors.
The doctor’s objections will depend upon your 
medical condition, as well as the types of treat-
ment that you want to avoid. Your primary care 
physician can help you anticipate which health-
care facilities are likely to take issue with your 
living will, and you can take that information 
into consideration when drafting your health-
care proxy or choosing where to receive your 
medical care.

201
 Chapter 14: Planning for Your Incapacity
Distributing copies of your living will
You should keep your original living will at home. Provide copies to the 
following parties:
 
 Your medical advocate
 
 Any family members you want to know of your wishes
 
 Any other people you want to know of your wishes
 
 Your personal physician
 
 If applicable, the medical facility where you’re receiving treatment
Discussing your living will with your family helps ensure that they under-
stand your wishes and won’t fight against them if something happens to you.
 
In order for your living will to be effective, your healthcare provider must 
know about it and have a copy. You should ask that the copy you provide be 
included in your chart.
If you’re not currently receiving medical treatment and are drafting your living 
will as a precaution, you’ll want your living will to be provided to any treatment 
facility you later enter. Your facility is most likely to receive a copy if you make 
sure that your doctor and family possess copies of your living will.
Reviewing your living will
As your life circumstances change, your wishes for the final stages of your 
life may change as well. You should review your living will every few years to 
make sure that it remains consistent with your wishes.
 
Your most recent living will is the one that is legally binding, but you must 
take care that nobody will inadvertently rely upon a copy of a prior version.
To update your living will, or if you no longer want a living will, you should 
do the following:
 
 Destroy your old living will and all copies.
 
 Notify your medical advocate of your decision.
 
 Provide written notice to any healthcare providers who possess your 
old living will and, if you’re updating it, provide them with copies of the 
new living will.
If you’re unable to revoke your living will in writing, perhaps due to a stroke 
or spinal cord injury, you can tell your medical advocate, family members, 

202
Par t IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
and doctors that you’ve changed your mind. They will follow your wishes, 
but you must be careful to be sure that your instructions reach the people who 
will be relying upon your living will, and that your new wishes are understood.
Looking into Other Advance Directives
Although the most common advance medical directive is the living will, you 
can create advance directives for other medical situations. For example, if 
you are undergoing surgery, you may want to create an advance directive 
describing what you want to happen during any period of incapacity, such as 
when you’re under anesthesia and unable to make or communicate medical 
decisions. The process for enacting this type of advance directive is the same 
as the process for creating a living will, described in this chapter in the sec-
tion “Drafting a Living Will.”
Healthcare proxies
Thanks to advances in medical care, you can expect to live longer lives than 
your ancestors did and to be significantly more active in your advanced 
years. At the same time, the medical technology exists to keep people alive 
long past the point where your ancestors would have died. This capability 
raises difficult questions of quality of life. For example:
 
 You may be confined to bed.
 
 You may be unable to feed yourself.
 
 You may not be able to bathe or groom yourself.
 
 You may require assistance to go to the toilet.
 
 You may not be aware of who you are.
 
 You may lose your ability to recognize friends and family.
 
 You may be unable to communicate.
 
 You may require invasive surgery to be kept alive.
 
 You may require major medical treatment, such as dialysis or chemotherapy.
 
 You may require artificial life support to be kept alive.
 
A healthcare proxy designates an individual, your medical advocate, who will 
make medical decisions on your behalf in the event that you become incapable 
of making those decisions. This person may sometimes be referenced as your 
healthcare agent or medical proxy. (The CD contains worksheets for planning 
and preparing your healthcare proxy.) See next section for more on your med-
ical advocate.

203
 Chapter 14: Planning for Your Incapacity
You have the right to direct your own health care, and your healthcare proxy 
helps ensure that your wishes are followed.
 
Don’t wait until you’re about to enter a hospital for treatment before execut-
ing a healthcare proxy. Create your proxy when you have the luxury of time 
to think about what you desire and can discuss your wishes with your family, 
friends, and physician.
Your medical advocate
Your medical advocate doesn’t have any control over your medical care while 
you’re competent to make those choices yourself. Upon your incapacity, your 
medical advocate gains enormous power over your medical care. When you’re 
not capable of communicating your wishes to your doctors, your medical advo-
cate communicates with your doctors to express how you want to be treated.
Your medical advocate should be
 
 An adult
 
 Someone willing to serve in this capacity
 
 Someone available to authorize medical care if the need arises
 
 Someone who will work to fulfill your wishes, even under pressure from 
your other friends and family members
Many people select their spouse or one of their adult children as their medi-
cal advocate. Others select a close personal friend. Some people want to 
designate their personal physician, although this option isn’t generally rec-
ommended and is forbidden by law in many states. If a physician serves as 
your medical advocate, that physician can’t participate in your treatment.
When selecting your medical advocate:
 
 If possible, choose a medical advocate who resides near you so that in the 
event of your incapacity, he can visit you and consult with your doctors.
 
 Choose somebody who is aware of your personal values and beliefs and 
who you trust to act in accord with those beliefs.
 
 Choose somebody you trust to assert your wishes, even in the face of 
opposition from your family.
 
 If you can, designate a backup medical advocate, in case your first 
choice is unavailable or declines to serve in that capacity.
  
 As you get older, consider designating a medical advocate who is 
younger than you.

204
Par t IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
 
Some people are tempted to appoint joint medical advocates. If both advocates 
are authorized to act independently, this decision can result in healthcare pro-
viders receiving conflicting instructions. Where consent of both advocates is 
required, delay can result if one of the advocates can’t be located. Having more 
than one person that you trust to be your medical advocate is a wonderful prob-
lem to have, but you’re best off naming one person as your advocate and the 
other as a successor.
You should be comfortable discussing your health and medical needs with 
your medical advocate, and your advocate should be willing to discuss those 
issues with you. Topics to discuss include
 
 What do you believe constitutes artificial life support, and what are your 
feelings on being kept alive artificially?
 
 What level of surgical intervention is acceptable in order to keep you alive?
 
 What level of consciousness or ability to communicate do you consider 
to be essential to your quality of life?
 
 What level of capacity for self-care, including capacity to attend to your own 
personal hygiene, do you consider to be essential to your quality of life?
Your discussions should leave you reasonably confident that your medical 
advocate will carry out your wishes, even in unanticipated circumstances.
You can reassure your advocate that
 
 A medical advocate will not be held liable for medical decisions made in 
good faith.
 
 Serving as a medical advocate will not result in responsibility for the 
cost of your medical care.
 
It’s crucial that you select a medical advocate that you trust to carry out your 
wishes. If you don’t have a person you trust with these decisions, you should 
consider not having a medical advocate. While this decision may force a court 
action in the event of your incapacity, any court-appointed guardian will be 
supervised by and answerable to the court.
Special instructions: Your 
wishes for your care
Your medical advocate is obligated to respect your wishes when making medi-
cal decisions on your behalf. Absent a good faith belief of a change in circum-
stances or that your wishes had changed, to the maximum extent possible 
your medical advocate should follow your instructions as written.

205
 Chapter 14: Planning for Your Incapacity
You should address the following questions in your healthcare proxy:
 
 When do you want the proxy to take effect? You should describe 
the circumstances under which the healthcare proxy will take effect. 
Possible triggering events include
 
• Terminal illness
 
• Serious personal injury
 
• Significant brain damage with no expectation of recovery
 
• Being in a coma without an expectation that you will awaken
 
• Being in a persistent vegetative state with no reasonable expecta-
tion of improvement
 
• Total inability to care for yourself with no expectation of recovery
 
 You can define as many or as few triggering circumstances as you 
desire.
 
 Where do you want to live? While your medical needs may take 
priority, you can define your preferred living circumstances in your 
healthcare proxy. When describing your preferences for your living 
arrangement:
 
• You can describe a preference for where you want to receive care, 
including care at home, in a nursing home, or in a rehabilitation 
center. For end-of-life care, you can express a preference for hospi-
tal, nursing home, hospice, or in-home care.
 
• You can designate a doctor or medical facility as preferred or to be 
avoided.
 
• You can grant your medical proxy broad discretion to select or 
discharge facilities and care providers.
 
• You can choose to authorize your medical advocate to move you 
to another city or state for treatment or to be with your family.
 
 What type of medical treatment you desire? Healthcare proxies are 
sometimes depicted as describing only the circumstances under which 
healthcare will be withdrawn. A healthcare proxy is much more flex-
ible than you may realize, and you can use it to define the type of care 
you want to receive and your preferences when medical treatment may 
interfere with the quality of your life. For example:
 
• Pain management: You can express your pain management prefer-
ences, including whether you want to maximize pain relief even if it 
may interfere with your consciousness and awareness, or if you’ll 
accept a greater amount of pain in order to remain more aware of 
your surroundings.

206
Par t IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
 
• Side effects of medication: You can describe side effects of medi-
cation that, if possible, you want to avoid, such as drowsiness, 
nausea, or hallucinations.
 
• Acts or omissions that may shorten or prolong life: You can 
specify what treatments you’d like in your final days of life, from 
a demand for any life-saving measure available to a request for an 
absolute minimum of medical intervention beyond your basic com-
fort.
 
• Medical conditions: You can also provide a context for treatment, 
such that you might desire life-prolonging care if you’re reasonably 
mentally competent, but not if you’re experiencing severe brain 
damage, dementia, or late-stage Alzheimer’s disease.
 
Use your healthcare proxy to help your healthcare providers understand what 
you regard as quality of life and appropriate comfort care.
Medical treatment you don’t want
If you don’t define limits, your medical advocate can make any medical deci-
sion that, but for your incapacity, you could make for yourself. You can use 
your healthcare proxy to list treatments that you don’t want to receive. Some 
common objections include
 
 Use of a respirator
 
 Use of dialysis
 
 Use of a feeding tube
 
 Resuscitation following cardiac arrest
 
 Invasive diagnostic procedures
 
 Blood transfusions or use of blood products
If you have personal, moral, or religious objections to certain medical treat-
ments, you may want to describe your beliefs in relation to those treatments.
 
If you want to make healthcare providers and paramedics aware that they 
should not administer CPR, in addition to your healthcare proxy, you can exe-
cute a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order. You should be able to obtain the DNR 
form from your doctor or hospital, and it may require your doctor’s signature. 
Once executed, you should keep the original DNR order on your person or in 
a conspicuous location so that paramedics will see it if they respond to your 
home. You may be able to obtain a DNR medical alert bracelet, which will help 
make paramedics aware of your wishes.

207
 Chapter 14: Planning for Your Incapacity
Instructions for organ or tissue donation
Your healthcare proxy can include instruction as to organ or tissue donation. 
You can also specify how your organs or tissues may be used, including for 
medical treatment, medical research, or education. You can also limit the use 
of your tissues and organs or express that you don’t want to be a donor.
 
If you don’t want to be an organ or tissue donor, you should state your opposi-
tion. Your silence about organ donation isn’t an instruction against donation 
and thus doesn’t prevent donation.
Executing a Healthcare Proxy
In most states, you must sign your healthcare proxy in front of two witnesses. 
Some states instead require you to sign before a notary. Still others require 
both witnesses and notarization.
 
Executing a healthcare proxy is a major decision. You should discuss your 
healthcare proxy with your family, friends, and physician before signing it. 
Don’t sign your healthcare proxy until you’re certain that it describes what 
you want from your care.
Distributing copies of your 
healthcare proxy
You should keep your healthcare proxy in a convenient, accessible location. 
Don’t keep the original in a safe deposit box or other location where people 
won’t be able to obtain it if you become incapacitated. You may choose to 
carry a copy with you in your wallet or purse.
You should provide copies of your healthcare proxy to
 
 Your medical advocate and alternate medical advocate
 
 Your personal physician
 
 Family members and close friends who you want to be informed of your 
wishes
 
 Any hospital or clinic where you will receive treatment
You can also provide a copy to your lawyer. If you’re active in a religion, you 
can choose to provide a copy to your church leader.

208
Par t IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
Revoking a healthcare proxy
As with any estate planning document, you should periodically review your 
healthcare proxy to make sure that it remains consistent with your wishes. 
Unless otherwise specified, your medical proxy is indefinite in its duration.
If you change your mind about having a healthcare proxy or want to change 
its terms or the designated medical advocate, you will need to revoke your 
proxy. You can do so by
 
 Providing oral notice
 
 Giving written notice
 
 Executing a new healthcare proxy
 
To be sure that your revocation is effective, either destroy the old healthcare 
proxy or clearly label it as Revoked. You should provide notice of the revoca-
tion to your medical advocate, your physician, any person who helped you 
draft your healthcare proxy, and any person who possesses a copy of your 
proxy. If you’ve executed a new healthcare proxy, you can distribute copies of 
the new document.
You can also provide within your healthcare proxy for its automatic termina-
tion, as in the following circumstances:
 
 The passage of time: You can choose to have your healthcare proxy 
expire at a particular date or after a specified number of years.
 
 Divorce or separation: If you’ve designated your spouse as your medi-
cal advocate or as the alternate, you may want to include a provision 
terminating the healthcare proxy upon divorce or separation. In most 
states, divorce will automatically terminate the ex-spouse as a medical 
advocate or alternate. In some states, termination also occurs upon legal 
separation from your spouse.
You can also indicate that you don’t want an event such as divorce to end 
your medical proxy so that your former spouse can continue to serve even if 
state law would otherwise have terminated the proxy.
Designating Your Financial 
Powers of Attorney
A power of attorney is a legal document you can use to grant legal author-
ity to another person. When you execute a power of attorney, you’re called 
the principal. The person to whom you grant legal authority is called your 

209
 Chapter 14: Planning for Your Incapacity
attorney-in-fact, your agent, or your proxy. Your power of attorney defines the 
powers of the agent, as well as any limits you want to place on that person’s 
authority.
 
A durable power of attorney remains valid even after the principal becomes 
legally incapacitated. The durable power of attorney authorizes your agent 
to manage your estate in the event of your incapacity, without going to court. 
Although your durable power of attorney appears to give your agent immedi-
ate power over your assets, as long as you remain competent your agent must 
follow your instructions. (The CD contains worksheets for planning and pre-
paring your durable power of attorney.)
 
The authority granted by a durable power of attorney terminates upon your 
death. If you want your agent to handle matters after your death, such as 
funeral arrangements, payment of bills, or the distribution of inheritances to 
your heirs, use your will to designate that person as executor of your estate.
A nondurable power of attorney becomes invalid if you lose mental capacity. 
This type of power of attorney is typically granted for a specific purpose — 
for example, during the principal’s temporary absence from the country — or 
for a specific purpose, such as to sign legal documents on behalf of the prin-
cipal in a specified legal transaction. You should include a termination provi-
sion, specifying a date upon which the power of attorney will expire.
A springing power of attorney doesn’t become effective until a specified condi-
tion has been met. For example, a springing durable power of attorney may 
provide that it becomes effective only upon a determination by a physician 
that the principal is mentally incompetent.
 
Financial institutions may be hesitant to accept a springing power of attorney, 
due to uncertainty as to whether the principal has truly been determined men-
tally incompetent. Not all states permit springing durable powers of attorney.
Selecting power of attorney
Your agent should be a legally competent adult. Your agent will have a great 
deal of control over your assets and ordinarily serves without any oversight. 
As with your healthcare proxy, you should select somebody who you trust. 
Frequent choices are a spouse or domestic partner, relative, or close friend. 
In making your selection, consider the following:
 
 Do you trust this person with your assets?
 
 Is this person willing to serve?
 
 Does this person have the time to serve?

210
Par t IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
 
 Is this person capable of performing the tasks necessary to manage your 
estate?
 
 Will distance make it inconvenient for this person to manage your estate?
 
 Is this person likely to have financial interests that compete with or are 
in conflict with your own?
 
 Does this person’s financial history reflect financial stability or money 
problems?
 
 Are you comfortable discussing the power of attorney with this person?
You should also designate an alternate agent in case your first choice 
becomes unwilling or unable to serve your estate. If no designated person is 
available to serve as agent, your power of attorney will fail.
Some people designate more than one agent. Joint appointments aren’t 
permitted in all states. If you choose this approach you must indicate in the 
power of attorney whether your attorneys-in-fact may act independently or if 
they must agree prior to taking action. When you appoint joint attorneys-in-
fact, you create a risk that they may not cooperate or communicate, or will 
make decisions in conflict with each other. Where joint consent is required, 
obtaining signatures from both attorneys-in-fact may result in delay.
 
Any attorney who works in this area can share horror stories about attorneys-
in-fact who looted the estate they were supposed to safeguard. If you’re 
unable to find somebody you believe is sufficiently trustworthy and capable 
of managing your assets, you should consider other options, including requir-
ing your agent to post a bond or foregoing a power of attorney in favor of the 
appointment of a conservator by a court.
Deciding between durable powers 
of attorney or periodic renewal
Historically, states required that powers of attorney be periodically renewed 
in order to remain valid. The durable power of attorney is recognized in all 
states and doesn’t require renewal. However, not all states recognize spring-
ing durable powers of attorney.
As a practical matter, you should periodically review your power of attorney 
and, as necessary, execute an updated version for several reasons:
 
 Some third parties may hesitate to accept a power of attorney that was 
executed many years before.
 
 Your wishes are likely to change over time.
 
 You should periodically review your choice of agent.

211
 Chapter 14: Planning for Your Incapacity
Drafting your durable power of attorney
A durable power of attorney usually gives very broad powers to the agent. 
In drafting your power of attorney, you have enormous flexibility in granting 
and limiting the powers of your agent and in instructing your agent as to your 
goals and wishes.
 
Some financial institutions may require that you use their power of attorney 
forms in order for them to recognize the authority of your agent. Check with 
your financial institutions to see whether they require the use of their form 
and, if so, complete and execute their forms in addition to your own power of 
attorney.
Determining which powers to grant
You choose the powers you grant to your agent. You’ll likely choose to 
grant broad powers, but you have the option of providing narrow authority. 
Commonly granted powers include the authority to
 
 Manage your expenses and pay your bills
 
 Manage your real and personal property
 
 Manage your bank accounts and engage in banking transactions
 
 Manage your retirement accounts
 
 Access your safe deposit box
 
 Collect government benefits
 
 Invest your money
 
 Purchase insurance and annuities
 
 Pay taxes
 
 Make legal claims
 
 File and pursue lawsuits
 
 Purchase and sell real estate
 
 Maintain and improve real estate
You may also choose to grant authority to
 
 Operate your business
 
 Amend trust instruments
 
 Make personal use of certain assets of your estate

212
Par t IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
 
 Hire people to take care of you
 
 Appoint a successor agent
 
 Make gifts
You can authorize your agent to plan for the receipt of government benefits, 
such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
If you have a revocable living trust, you can authorize your agent to amend 
your trust. If you want to grant your agent that authority, you should explic-
itly grant the authority in your power of attorney document.
All powers you grant will end at the time of your death.
Placing limits on the authority of the agent
Your agent operates under a number of restrictions. Your agent
 
 May not make, amend, or revoke your will
 
 May not enact a healthcare proxy for you
 
 May not utilize the assets of your estate for personal benefit unless you 
have authorized the use
 
 May not receive payment for services performed for your estate unless 
authorized by you
 
 In some states, including Georgia and Florida, may not delegate the 
powers of the agent to other people
Your agent is restricted from using your assets for personal benefit. You 
should state in your power of attorney whether you authorize your agent to
 
 Make personal use of specific property or assets of your estate
 
 Personally benefit from transactions performed on behalf of the estate
 
 Borrow money from your estate at a customary rate of interest
 
If you authorize your agent to make gifts, be aware that the power to make 
gifts is easily abused. If you don’t want your agent to be able to make gifts or 
donations from your assets, you should include that restriction in the power 
of attorney document.
If you want to grant gift-giving authority, you should specify any limits you 
want to place on who may receive a gift and the amounts that may be given. 
For example:

213
 Chapter 14: Planning for Your Incapacity
 
 You may limit gifts to members of your family, or to specified charities.
 
 You may limit the type of gifts that may be given — for example, birthday 
or Christmas presents.
 
 You may choose to permit gifts only to the extent necessary to achieve 
tax or Medicaid planning goals.
 
 You may forbid gifts that could increase tax exposure for your estate or 
potentially affect your eligibility for public benefits.
If you want your agent to be eligible to receive gifts, you should state that in 
your power of attorney.
Compensating the agent
You’re not required to compensate your agent for time spent managing your 
estate, and many attorneys-in-fact perform their services without charge. 
Unless you specifically provide for payment, the agent won’t be compensated 
for services performed for your estate.
If you specify an amount of compensation, the agent will receive the compen-
sation you describe. You can, for example, specify compensation at an hourly 
rate or specify sums to be paid for specific services.
 
If you grant compensation but don’t specify an amount, the agent will be entitled 
to reasonable fees for services provided. If services are performed while you 
remain competent, you and your agent should seek to agree on the fee to be 
paid. If not, a court may need to determine what fee is reasonable under the 
circumstances.
You can provide for your estate to reimburse your agent for the reasonable 
cost of services required by your estate. Such expenses may include
 
 Investment advice
 
 Professional trust or asset management
 
 Property management services
 
 Accounting and tax preparation services
Keeping records
Your agent should maintain records of your income, assets, expenditures, 
and financial transactions performed on your behalf. If you want to impose 
additional requirements, such as a periodic accounting of the estate, you can 
include that requirement in the power of attorney.

214
Par t IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
You can provide for compensation of your agent and reimbursement of 
expenses associated with any special recordkeeping or accounting require-
ments you impose.
Executing power of attorney
Depending upon your state, you must sign the power of attorney in the pres-
ence of two witnesses, a notary public, or both. Your witnesses should be 
legally competent adults. Consider having your power of attorney notarized 
even when it isn’t required, as notarization can help convince third parties to 
accept your power of attorney.
 
You’re required to sign one copy of your power of attorney and can designate 
that copies have the same authority as the original. Executing multiple origi-
nals is nonetheless common. Some organizations, such as financial institu-
tions, will require that your agent provide them with an original copy of your 
power of attorney. Even if it will eventually be returned, it’s important that 
your agent not be placed in the position of having to surrender his last or only 
original copy in order to gain authority over your accounts.
 
If you believe that somebody may challenge your mental capacity to execute a 
power of attorney, obtain a letter from a physician that confirms that you’re 
mentally competent and are able to understand the power of attorney document.
Revoking a power of attorney
You should periodically review your power of attorney to make sure that it 
remains consistent with your wishes and to verify your choice of agent as 
well as of any successors. Review is appropriate after major changes in your 
life circumstances, such as divorce.
You can revoke your power of attorney by
 
 Incorporating a specific date of termination into the original grant document
 
 Providing notice to the agent or successor that you’re terminating their 
authority
 
 In some states, by filing a formal notice of revocation with the recorder 
of deeds in the city or county where you live

215
 Chapter 14: Planning for Your Incapacity
Revocation will also occur
 
 If your designated agent and successors are unwilling or unable to serve
 
 In some states, if your agent is your spouse and the power of attorney 
doesn’t provide otherwise, upon initiation of divorce proceedings
 
 Upon your death
When revoking a power of attorney, you should provide written notice of 
revocation to
 
 Your agent
 
 Every person who possesses a copy of your power of attorney
 
 Any bank or financial institution where your agent may have used the 
power of attorney
 
 If applicable in your state, the recorder of deeds in the city or county 
where you live, and in any county where you own real estate
Your notice should request that recipients return to you any copies of the 
power of attorney that are in their possession.
 
If you’re revoking the authority of your agent, send notice of revocation by 
certified mail, with a return receipt requested.

 Understanding retirement savings options
 Leaving your retirement savings to your heirs
 Avoiding estate and income taxes
I
f you’re like most people, you’re putting money into retirement savings 
accounts so that you can support your lifestyle after you retire. This chap-
ter outlines the most common types of retirement savings accounts and the 
benefits of tax-deferred savings. You find out how to change your beneficiary 
and the importance of keeping records when you change your beneficiary.
You may want to leave your retirement accounts to your spouse, another 
beneficiary or beneficiaries, or even a charity. At times, you may want your 
retirement funds to go into a trust fund or into your estate. This chapter 
helps you understand the advantages and disadvantages of each of those 
choices, including income and estate tax consequences.
Exploring Retirement Savings Accounts
Retirement savings accounts come in a variety of forms. The type (or types) 
you have will depend upon what your employer has made available, whether 
you chose to take advantage of those savings opportunities, whether you 
opened any retirement savings accounts of your own, and whether you took 
advantage of your retirement savings options during any periods of self-
employment.
You have a lot to gain by contributing to retirement savings accounts. 
Beyond the obvious:

218
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
 
 Your contributions grow tax-free.
 
 The earlier you start saving, the more years your savings will continue 
to compound and grow.
 
 Your contribution of pretax dollars may result in immediate income tax 
savings.
 
 Your retirement savings accounts are usually shielded from your creditors.
 
 Withdrawals from retirement accounts funded with money that has 
already been subject to income tax are made free of income tax.
 
If you’re not yet retired, you have the opportunity for additional retirement 
savings. Choosing the right account may help you maximize your returns.
Retirement savings accounts fall into three main categories:
 
 Retirement accounts anybody may use
 
 Employment-based retirement accounts
 
 Self-employed retirement accounts
The different types of retirement savings accounts have a lot of features in 
common, but you should be aware of the key differences:
 
 While most retirement savings accounts are tax-deferred, some are 
funded with post-tax dollars.
 
 Limits on contributions can vary significantly, depending upon the type 
of account and your income.
 
 Some retirement plans can be rolled over to a spouse or other desig-
nated beneficiary, giving them some or all of the benefits of tax-deferral. 
Other plans are more restrictive as to if and when they may be rolled 
over to a beneficiary.
 
You may be able to participate in more than one retirement savings plan. Be 
aware that your contributions to one plan may reduce the amount you’re eligi-
ble to contribute to another plan or reduce the amount of your tax-deferment 
for another plan.
 
Under some circumstances, the IRS will waive penalties for early withdrawals 
from your retirement savings. For example, you may be allowed to withdraw 
money to pay for certain medical costs or disabilities, certain higher educa-
tion expenses, or the purchase of a first home. Unless you’re prepared to pay 
a penalty, you should be certain that your withdrawal won’t trigger a penalty 
before you withdraw the funds.

219
 Chapter 15: Those Cushy Retirement Funds
Retirement savings accounts 
available to anyone
The two plans you’ve probably heard the most about are the Individual 
Retirement Account (IRA) and the Roth IRA. These plans are very similar, 
with this key difference:
 
 You fund your traditional IRA with pretax dollars and pay income tax on 
money when you withdraw it from the account.
 
 You fund your Roth IRA with post-tax dollars and don’t pay income tax 
on your withdrawals.
Going traditional
As long as you’re below the age of 70½ and have earned income, the traditional 
IRA is available to you. It has the following features:
 
 Contributions are tax-deductible, with taxes on contributions and inter-
est deferred until you withdraw money.
 
 You may contribute earned income, up to $5,000 each year. That cap 
will be increased by a cost of living adjustment starting in 2009.
 
 It’s no harder to start a traditional IRA than it is to open a bank account.
 
 Early withdrawals from an IRA, taken before you reach the age of 59½, 
are subject to a penalty.
 
 You must start taking withdrawals at the age of 70½ , whether or not 
you’re retired.
 
 A traditional IRA may be rolled over only into another traditional IRA or 
a SEP-IRA or may be converted and rolled over into Roth IRA.
Choosing a Roth IRA
The Roth IRA is very similar to a traditional IRA, but your eligibility phases 
out based upon your income:
 
 Contributions are made with post-tax dollars. Your account balance 
grows tax-free, and you pay no income tax on withdrawals.
 
 The basic limit on contribution is $5,000. That cap will be increased by a 
cost of living adjustment starting in 2009.
 
 Roth IRA contributions are subject to income limits, and your maximum 
contribution is phased out as you exceed those limits.

220
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
 
 Early withdrawals from a Roth IRA, taken before you reach the age of 
59½, are subject to a penalty.
 
 A Roth IRA may be rolled over only into another Roth IRA.
If you’ve reached the age of 50, you can make a catch-up contribution to 
either a traditional or Roth IRA, which means that in 2008, your contributions 
are capped at $6,000 instead of $5,000. Regardless of your age, contributions 
to your Roth IRA remain subject to income limits.
Employment-based retirement 
savings accounts
The most common employer-sponsored retirement plan is the 401(k) plan. 
Employers often contribute to these plans on behalf of employees, perhaps 
matching an employee’s contribution. Here’s what you need to know:
 
 Contributions are made with pretax dollars, with taxes on contributions 
and interest deferred until you withdraw money.
 
 As of 2008, you can contribute $15,500 per year to your 401(k) account. 
If you’re over age 50, that amount increases to $20,500. Starting in 2009, 
these amounts are subject to cost of living increases.
 
 You may borrow against the balance of your 401(k) account.
 
 When you change jobs, you can normally roll your 401(k) over into your 
new employer’s retirement plan or into an IRA.
 
 You must ordinarily start taking withdrawals after you reach the age of 
70½, whether or not you’re retired.
A relatively new variation of the 401(k) plan is the Roth 401(k). The key dif-
ference is that the Roth 401(k) is funded with after-tax earnings. Your balance 
grows tax-free. Once you reach the age of 59½, you can make withdrawals 
without penalty and without owing any income tax. You can also avoid the 
requirement that you take withdrawals at age 70½ by rolling your Roth 401(k) 
into a Roth IRA.
If you work for an educational institution, museum, or nonprofit organization, 
your employer may offer a 403(b) plan. These accounts are very similar to 
401(k) plans. The primary difference is that some employers offer poor over-
sight of investment options, resulting in excessive fees or poor returns for 
employees.
If you work for the government or for certain tax-exempt organizations, you may 
participate in a 457(b) plan. These plans are again extremely similar to 401(k) 

221
 Chapter 15: Those Cushy Retirement Funds
plans. 457(b) plans also have special catch-up rules, permitting employees to 
catch up for years in which they weren’t able to make the maximum contribu-
tion to their plan. Government employees may reap special advantages from 
these plans, by being exempted from penalties for early withdrawal upon their 
retirement, even if they retire before the age of 59½.
Additional retirement savings plans that may be offered by employers 
include profit-sharing plans, in which the employer gives participat-
ing employees a share of its profits, and SIMPLE IRA plans, in which the 
employer facilitates the employee’s participation in an account analogous to 
a traditional IRA.
Self-employed retirement savings accounts
The most common savings plans used by self-employed people are the Keogh 
plan, the Solo 401(k), and the Simplified Employee Pension plan (SEP IRA).
These plans may also be used to benefit employees of small businesses. If 
you have employees, in order to take advantage of your own retirement sav-
ings options, you may also be required to contribute to your employee’s 
retirement plans. As a small employer, you should discuss your options and 
obligations with your accountant or a retirement planning professional.
All of these plans cap contributions, with solo 401(k) plans offering the most 
generous caps on tax-deductible contributions. Under present rules, if you’re 
50 or older, you may qualify to make higher catch up contributions to each of 
these retirement plans.
Keogh plan
A Keogh plan, sometimes called an HR 10 plan, is available to sole propri-
etors and business partnerships. You can set up a Keogh plan as either a 
defined benefit plan or a defined contribution plan:
 
 In a defined benefit plan, you receive a predetermined benefit at the 
end of the plan.
 
 In a defined contribution plan, your contributions are defined by the 
plan and your benefits are determined by the balance of your account at 
retirement.
The key aspects of a Keogh plan are as follows:
 
 Contributions are made with pretax dollars, with taxes on contributions 
and interest deferred until you withdraw money.

222
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
 
 Contribution limits are more generous than the limits for standard IRAs, 
with the contribution limit for 2008 being set at $46,000 or 100 percent of 
your eligible compensation, whichever is less. Even if you contribute a 
greater amount, your tax-deductible contribution is limited to 25 percent 
of your eligible compensation as defined by your plan. For self-employed 
people, your eligible compensation will typically be your net earnings 
for services provided to your business after your retirement contribu-
tion is deducted. (Investment income isn’t eligible.)
 
 Keogh plans can be costly and cumbersome to create and maintain, 
particularly as compared to a SEP IRA.
 
 Early withdrawals from a Keogh plan, taken before you reach the age of 
59½, are subject to a penalty.
 
 If you own more than 5 percent of your business, you must start taking 
withdrawals from your account no later than April 1 of the year after you 
reach the age of 70½, whether or not you’re retired.
SEP IRA
The Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP IRA) is intended for self-
employed people and small businesses. These plans are very similar to con-
ventional IRAs, but have much higher contribution limits.
 
 Contributions are made with pretax dollars, with taxes on contributions 
and interest deferred until you withdraw money.
 
 Contribution limits are more generous than the limits for standard IRAs, 
with the contribution limit for 2008 being set at the lesser of $46,000 or 
25 percent of your compensation.
 
 SEP IRAs are easy to create and maintain.
 
 Early withdrawals from a SEP IRA, taken before you reach the age of 59½, 
are subject to a penalty.
 
 You must start taking withdrawals from your account no later than April 1 
of the year after you reach the age of 70½, whether or not you’re retired.
Solo 401(k) plan
A Solo 401(k) plan is very similar to any other 401(k) plan. If you’re able to 
make large contributions to your plan, a solo 401(k) permits contributions 
significantly larger than those permitted under Keogh plans and SEP IRAs. 
Here’s what you need to know:
 
 Contributions are made with pretax dollars, with taxes on contributions 
and interest deferred until you withdraw money.
 
 Based upon 2008 limits, you may contribute up to 100 percent of the first 
$15,500 of your compensation. You may further contribute up to 25 percent 
of your compensation income or 20 percent of your self-employment 
income.

223
 Chapter 15: Those Cushy Retirement Funds
 
 Solo 401(k) plans are more cumbersome to create and maintain than a 
SEP IRA, although the process isn’t particularly complicated or expen-
sive if you don’t have employees.
 
 You may be able to borrow money from your Solo 401(k) plan.
 
 Early withdrawals from a Solo 401(k), taken before you reach the age of 
59½, are subject to a penalty.
 
 You must start taking withdrawals from your account no later than 
April 1 of the year after you reach the age of 70½, whether or not you’re 
retired.
If you hire a full-time employee who isn’t your spouse, expect that you will 
have to include your employee in your Solo 401(k) plan. That will end its 
status as a solo plan and make administration of the plan much more compli-
cated.
Putting Off the Tax Man
Most retirement savings accounts allow for tax-deferred savings, which 
doesn’t mean that you never pay taxes on your retirement savings. It means 
that although you don’t pay income tax on your money at the time you put 
it into your account, you pay income tax on the money you eventually with-
draw from the account.
Tax deferral gives you an upfront benefit by reducing your taxable income. 
Your investment grows tax-free, so it compounds more rapidly than a taxable 
investment. But tax deferral doesn’t help you in the event of economic down-
turn, such that your savings don’t grow or even shrink in value.
When evaluating the benefits of tax-deferral, you also need to estimate what 
your tax rate will be at the time you make withdrawals. If your tax rate isn’t 
likely to go down when you retire, consider investing some of your retire-
ment savings in accounts that aren’t tax-deferred.
Moving Assets from One Tax-Deferred 
Investment to Another
A rollover is the tax-free transfer of assets from one tax-free or tax-deferred 
retirement account into another. After the rollover, your savings continue to 
grow in the new account on a tax-deferred basis.

224
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
During your lifetime, you may have to roll over your retirement savings when 
you change jobs. If you’re required to roll over your accounts and don’t do so 
in a timely manner, usually 60 days, your account balance is taxed as income.
Rollover may occur in two ways:
 
 A direct rollover, or plan-to-plan transfer, occurs when the eligible funds 
are directly transferred from your employer-sponsored plan to the new 
qualifying retirement savings account.
 
 An indirect transfer occurs when your employer-sponsored plan issues you 
a check for the account balance. You then have a limited amount of time 
to transfer part or all of that money into your new qualifying retirement 
savings account.
If you have to roll over your account due to a change of employment, your 
employers may assist you with the process through a direct rollover.
 
If you’re rolling over your self-employed retirement accounts or are becoming 
self-employed, avoid mistakes: Discuss the process with a retirement planning 
professional.
When you die, your account beneficiary may also seek to roll over any bal-
ance of your retirement accounts. Not all accounts are eligible for rollover, so 
you should discuss this point with your retirement planning professional.
When permitted, rollover is easiest if your beneficiary is your spouse. 
Normally, once the rollover into your spouse’s account is complete, the IRS 
treats the money as if it was contributed by your spouse. With IRA accounts, 
it’s also possible for your IRA to be treated as if it was the surviving spouse’s 
account.
Rules are different for nonspouse beneficiaries. Although recent legislation 
attempted to make retirement account rollovers easier, the IRS has inter-
preted the legislation very narrowly. As a consequence, eligibility to roll over 
your account to anybody other than a spouse, including your domestic part-
ner, children, or grandchildren, is subject to the rules of the account. Even if 
your account presently permits a nonspouse rollover, those rules may later 
change, disqualifying your beneficiary from the benefits of rollover. If your 
account doesn’t permit nonspouse rollover, your beneficiary will be forced to 
withdraw the entire balance within a few years after your death.
Rules may apply requiring your nonspouse beneficiary to start withdrawing 
funds from the account and to withdraw all funds within the space of a few 
years. For an IRA, that normally means that the nonspouse has to start taking 
withdrawals from your rolled over funds by December 31 of the year following 
your death and withdraw all funds within five years.

225
 Chapter 15: Those Cushy Retirement Funds
 
Be aware of the many potential traps in rolling over a retirement account to a 
nonspouse. A mistake can make the money immediately taxable. If you intend 
to designate a nonspouse beneficiary for your retirement accounts, consult a 
retirement planning professional to make sure that it’s done correctly.
Designating a Beneficiary
Whatever retirement savings account you choose, you’ll have to name a benefi-
ciary for your account. Your beneficiary will receive the account balance upon 
your death, without its going through probate. He may also be able to benefit 
from rollover rules and continued tax deferral (see the preceding section).
Selecting your beneficiary
Choosing a beneficiary for your retirement account isn’t much different from 
choosing a beneficiary for your insurance policies or other assets (see Chapter 16). If 
you’re married, you’ll probably name your spouse as your primary beneficiary.
You’re not limited to selecting a single beneficiary. You can designate more 
than one person as your primary beneficiary. If you designate multiple ben-
eficiaries, you should also designate the percentage of your account that you 
want to go to each beneficiary.
Pitfalls of beneficiary designation forms
Under a standard beneficiary designation 
form, your alternate beneficiaries don’t qualify 
to receive anything from your account while 
any of your primary beneficiaries remains 
alive. If you designate your children as your 
primary beneficiaries and your grandchildren 
as alternate beneficiaries, your grandchildren 
don’t automatically receive the share of their 
deceased parent.
Your beneficiary designation form may also 
not remind you of the possibility of choosing a 
charity as your beneficiary, even though such a 
designation may produce significant tax advan-
tages for your estate.
If the standard form doesn’t suit your needs, 
contact the plan administrator to see whether 
it has an alternate form that will accommodate 
you. If not, designate your beneficiaries the way 
you want, return the form, and confirm with the 
plan administrator that your beneficiary desig-
nation has been accepted and processed.

226
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
When you designate a beneficiary other than your spouse, you need to con-
sider the rollover rules for your account. You also need to consider the tax 
consequences of your designation. Think about the following questions:
 
 Does your plan permit rollover by a nonspouse?
 
 Will your gift trigger estate tax liability for your estate?
 
 How quickly will the recipient have to withdraw funds from a tax-
deferred account, and what are the income tax consequences?
 
 If you leave your account to your grandchildren, will you trigger generation-
skipping taxes (see Chapter 6)?
If you have substantial retirement savings that you believe will be passed on 
to an heir other than your spouse, it makes sense to discuss your plan with a 
tax professional. You can name a trust as beneficiary, but you again need to 
be careful about tax consequences. Some specially designed trusts, such as 
the IRA inheritor’s trust, are designed to stretch out the income distributions 
so as to minimize income taxes, while also offering asset protection benefits 
to your beneficiaries. If you’re considering using a trust as a beneficiary, con-
sult an estate planning professional.
 
You should keep a copy of your beneficiary designation forms with your financial 
records. That way, in the event of confusion about your beneficiary designa-
tion after your death, your personal representative has clear record of your 
choice. All bureaucracies make mistakes, and that includes the one holding 
your retirement savings account. If your estate is unable to establish that you 
submitted the change of beneficiary form prior to your death, your savings 
account will likely pass to the prior beneficiary.
You should periodically verify your beneficiary designation with the institu-
tion that holds your retirement savings account. That way, if any information 
is lost from your account, you’ll discover the omission and be able to correct 
the error.
Loss of rollover rights to your spouse’s account
As a general rule, any money remaining in 
your retirement accounts may be rolled over 
into your spouse’s retirement account, without 
being treated as a withdrawal, allowing your 
estate to avoid paying income taxes on your 
tax-deferred savings and maximizing the ben-
efit of those savings to your spouse.
When you designate somebody other than your 
spouse, these advantages are lost. Thus, if you 
can choose between leaving the nonspouse 
the retirement account or a gift of approxi-
mately equal value, in most cases you’re better 
off keeping your spouse as your primary ben-
eficiary and giving the nonspouse the alternate 
bequest.

227
 Chapter 15: Those Cushy Retirement Funds
Limits on who you may select as a beneficiary
States are concerned that upon your death, you might impoverish your 
spouse, which is why they restrict your ability to cut your spouse out of your 
will. The same applies within the context of retirement accounts. You should 
expect that you’re required to designate your spouse as the sole beneficiary 
of your qualified retirement plan. Even if that designation isn’t a requirement, 
your spouse may have an interest in your retirement plan under the commu-
nity or marital property laws of your state.
 
If you want to designate a beneficiary other than your spouse, you may have 
to get your spouse’s consent. If consent is required, your spouse can sign a 
waiver form permitting you to designate somebody else.
Why it’s wise to select alternate beneficiaries
The primary reason to designate an alternate beneficiary is that your ben-
eficiary may not survive you. Although unusual, sometimes your beneficiary 
will decline your gift. If you don’t designate an alternate beneficiary, your 
retirement account will go into your estate, with the following consequences:
 
 Inclusion of your retirement account in your estate will probably trigger 
a large income tax bill and possibly even estate taxes.
 
 In states where your personal representative or the attorney for your 
estate are paid a percentage of the value of your estate, this event may 
significantly inflate their fees when your estate is probated.
Changing your beneficiaries
Changing beneficiaries is usually as simple as filling out a form, and return-
ing it to the plan administrator or the institution where your account is held. 
If your plan is employment-based, ask your plan administrator for a form. 
Otherwise, ask the institution holding your retirement savings account.
 
Don’t simply send a letter asking that your beneficiary be changed. Use the 
approved form and follow the instructions accompanying the form. Otherwise, 
your change of beneficiary may not be successful or may be subject to chal-
lenge by the original beneficiary. After you submit the change of beneficiary, 
verify that the form has been received and processed.
Maintaining Control Over Your Accounts
If you want to maintain control over your retirement account funds after your 
death, you can do so by designating either your estate or a trust fund as your 
beneficiary.

228
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
Some trust funds, such as the IRA inheritor’s trust, try to preserve some of 
the benefits of tax deferral while limiting your heirs’ access to the funds. Forming 
specialized trust funds for the purpose of avoiding or delaying taxes can be com-
plex and is best done with the help of an estate planning professional.
If you’re not concerned about the tax consequences to your estate, you’re 
free to designate any trust, including your revocable living trust, as the 
beneficiary of your account. After taxes are paid, distribution of the remain-
ing funds will be subject to any restrictions and conditions you have incor-
porated into your trust. (For more information on drafting your trust, see 
Chapter 11.)
Similarly, once the money is part of your estate, you can make conditional 
gifts through your will so that your heirs don’t receive their bequest until 
your conditions are met. (For more information on placing conditions on tes-
tamentary gifts, see Chapter 8.)
The Tax Consequences of Putting Your 
Retirement Savings into Your Estate
If you designate your estate as the beneficiary of your retirement account, 
the balance of that account will go into your taxable estate. This can also 
happen if you don’t name an alternate beneficiary, and your primary benefi-
ciary dies before you do. Your estate will then owe income taxes on any tax-
deferred balance and may also owe estate taxes.
If you don’t designate a beneficiary, depending upon the terms of the 
account, your spouse may be treated as your beneficiary, or the balance may 
go into your estate with the same result.
Naming a nonspouse as your beneficiary will save your estate from paying 
income tax on your retirement account balance, but it won’t keep the balance 
out of your taxable estate.
If your spouse is the beneficiary of your retirement account, the balance will 
pass to your spouse free of estate taxes. Your spouse can then take advan-
tage of rollover rules to avoid paying income tax. But remember, the balance 
of your retirement account then becomes part of your spouse’s estate and 
may be subject to estate taxes upon the death of your spouse.
You may also consider designating a tax-exempt organization as your beneficiary. 
Due to its tax exemption, the organization won’t pay any income tax on your gift, 
and the balance of your account won’t be included in your taxable estate.

 Understanding different types of life insurance

 Choosing your beneficiary
 Avoiding estate taxes
L
ife insurance can be a powerful tool in your estate plan. Even though it’s 
probably not mentioned in your will or living trust, your life insurance 
can torpedo your estate plan.
When planning your estate, you need to understand the different types of life 
insurance and which type best suits your needs. You must also consider how 
ownership of the policy and your choice of beneficiary can affect your estate 
and create possible estate tax liability. You should also think about how your 
will or trust, as well as a probate court, handle insurance proceeds.
Taking a Look at the Different 
Types of Life Insurance
You know you need insurance, but what happens when you talk to your 
insurance agent or financial planner? You’re presented with an assortment of 
options, and knowing which ones fit your needs is hard.
For most life insurance policies, you have to pass a medical screening when 
you apply, answering questions about your health and possibly obtaining a 
medical examination. If you have serious medical problems, you may be dis-
qualified from life insurance, or it may become unaffordable. You can find life 
insurance policies that don’t require health information, but they’ll provide a 
limited death benefit.

230
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
Your premiums are affected by factors including your health history, your 
family’s health history, your age, and whether you’re a smoker. You may be 
asked about lifestyle choices and whether you participate in high-risk activi-
ties, such as skydiving, auto racing, rock climbing, or flying.
Premiums are normally paid on a periodic basis, usually monthly or annually. 
You may be able to find single premium insurance, where you pay a lump sum 
premium when you open the policy and aren’t required to make any addi-
tional premium payments.
You can purchase your own separate life insurance policy, or you can pur-
chase a joint policy with your spouse. If you buy a joint policy, you can 
choose between a first-to-die policy, which pays a death benefit when one of 
you dies, or second-to-die (also called last survivor) insurance, which pays a 
death benefit only after both you and your spouse die.
Life insurance falls into two broad categories: term life and permanent life 
insurance. A term life insurance policy provides coverage for a fixed period of 
time. Permanent life insurance accumulates value and (assuming premiums 
are paid) provides an eventual payout or death benefit. The three types of 
permanent life insurance are whole life, universal life, and variable life.
 
For estate planning purposes, permanent life insurance is usually your best 
option.
When planning your estate, consider the following factors when purchasing 
life insurance:
 
 The benefit of cash value accumulation and the opportunity to borrow 
against your policy or withdraw cash
 
 Your ability to later transfer ownership to another person or to a trust
 
 Whether the policy will remain in effect and also remain affordable 
throughout your lifetime
The following sections go through the types of insurance in more detail.
Term life
Term life insurance provides you with a death benefit during the period of 
time that your policy is in effect. If you die during the period of coverage, 
your beneficiary receives the death benefit (the value of the policy). If you 
don’t die during the period of coverage, your coverage expires.
Your premium goes to the insurance company’s expenses and profit, as well 
as to pay benefits to other insured people who die within the period of cover-
age. As you get older, your premium may increase. A term life policy has no 
value after your coverage expires.

231
 Chapter 16: Life Insurance: Making Sure It Doesn’t Backfire
Your death benefit may be fixed (level) throughout the term of your policy, 
or it may decrease over the term of your policy. Decreasing term life insur-
ance may be appropriate if your financial needs will diminish over time.
Your term life policy may be renewable or nonrenewable. If your policy is 
renewable, you automatically qualify to continue the policy when your cur-
rent term expires. If your policy isn’t renewable, you must qualify for a new 
policy in order to continue coverage.
 
Some term life policies are convertible, meaning that you’re allowed to convert 
the policy to whole life or variable life without answering health questions, as 
long as your policy remains in effect.
Whole life
A whole life policy provides insurance coverage for your whole life, rather 
than for a specific coverage period. It has the following characteristics:
 
 Your premium is greater than the cost to the insurer of providing your 
insurance coverage. The extra amount you pay goes into a cash value 
account.
 
 Your cash value account is invested by your insurance company and 
grows in value. You don’t control how your money is invested.
 
 During your life, you can borrow against your cash value account, or you 
can surrender part or all of your policy and receive a payout from your 
cash value account. If you surrender insurance coverage, you terminate 
part or all of your death benefit.
 
 When the policy reaches its maturity date, the insurance company will 
pay the accumulated cash value to you. This amount is equal to your 
death benefit.
The maturity date for your policy will probably be age 100, or possibly an 
even greater age.
Universal life
Universal life insurance is very similar to whole life coverage, except you 
get greater flexibility in making premium payments. Your policy will usually 
define minimum and maximum premiums you may contribute, but you can 
pay any premium you choose within that range.
If you pay greater premiums, the cash value of the policy should grow faster, 
and you may also be able to increase your death benefit. However, you may 

232
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
have to undergo a medical screening in order to increase your coverage. If 
the value of your cash value account drops below a certain threshold, your 
policy may lapse.
Universal life policies may offer an enhanced benefit option, at an additional 
cost. If you choose this option, your beneficiary will receive both the death 
benefit from your policy and the accumulated cash value of your policy. 
Thus, if you have a $1 million death benefit and have accumulated $250,000 in 
cash value at the time you die, your beneficiary receives $1.25 million.
Variable life
A traditional variable life insurance policy is similar to whole life insurance. 
(See the “Whole life” section earlier in this chapter.) The key difference is 
that you choose how the money in your cash value account is invested. Your 
variable life policy has a fixed premium for the life of the policy. Your policy 
may offer a minimum guaranteed death benefit. If the cash value of your 
account exceeds a specified threshold, your death benefit increases.
You can also choose variable universal life insurance. As with universal life 
insurance, you choose the amount of your premium within a range specified 
in your policy. You can borrow against your policy and make cash withdraw-
als. Withdrawals may reduce the face value of your policy and may also be 
taxed. The policy will have a fixed death benefit, and you may be able to 
choose an enhanced death benefit.
Like whole life insurance, if the value of the cash value account drops below a 
certain threshold, your policy may lapse. Following a period of years defined 
by the policy, many variable universal life insurance policies guarantee a min-
imum death benefit without regard to the performance of your investments.
 
Variable life insurance policies often have very high management fees as com-
pared to other forms of permanent life insurance.
Deciding Who Owns the Life Insurance
Every life insurance policy has at least one owner, named insured, and ben-
eficiary. If the policy doesn’t identify a separate owner, the insured is the 
owner of the policy. The owner pays the premiums, chooses the beneficiary, 
and, unless the initial designation of beneficiary is irrevocable, may change 
the beneficiary. The beneficiary receives the proceeds of the policy when the 
insured dies.
You may not give much thought to who owns your life insurance policy. You 
bought it, so you own it, right? Actually, there’s a good chance that you don’t 

233
 Chapter 16: Life Insurance: Making Sure It Doesn’t Backfire
want to own your policy. If you own the policy, your life insurance proceeds 
are part of your estate and may be subject to estate taxes.
Before you get excited about giving away your policies, keep in mind the 
advantages of continued ownership:
 
 When you own your policy, you control it, and you choose your 
beneficiaries.
 
 You can borrow against the cash value of your policy.
 
 For some policies, you can choose an investment strategy.
 
 You determine how your beneficiaries will receive the proceeds of the 
policy, whether through a lump sum, annuity payout, or trust.
If you surrender ownership of your life insurance policy and become unin-
surable, perhaps due to age or illness, you won’t be able to obtain another 
policy.
The process of transferring ownership of an insurance policy is usually 
simple. You complete a simple form provided by your insurance company. 
But to avoid estate taxes:
 
 The transfer must be absolute, with your giving up all control of the 
policy, ability to change beneficiaries, and ability to borrow against its 
cash value.
 
 You must complete the transfer at least three years before you die.
If you don’t satisfy those requirements, the insurance proceeds will be 
included in your estate.
Some policies permit you to designate a contingent owner. If you transfer 
ownership of the policy to your spouse, when your spouse predeceases you, 
the policy again becomes part of your estate. If you designate your children 
as the contingent owner, ownership of the policy instead goes from your 
spouse to them. You can also designate a trust as the contingent owner.
The following sections outline your ownership options.
Ownership by a spouse
As a general rule, ownership by your spouse is appropriate when your com-
bined estates, including the life insurance proceeds, will not be subject to 
estate tax. Life insurance provides a simple mechanism to get money to your 
spouse that may be necessary to pay your debts, ongoing bills and expenses 
and support your children. If you transfer ownership of your life insurance to 
your spouse:

234
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
 
 Your spouse remains able to borrow against the cash value of your 
insurance.
 
 Your spouse maintains control over the beneficiaries.
 
 If you have variable life insurance, your spouse gets to choose the 
investment strategy.
Although your surviving spouse benefits from the unlimited marital deduc-
tion and pays no estate taxes on the insurance proceeds, their estate will be 
taxed when they die. Applying current tax rates, 45 percent of your insurance 
proceeds may end up going to the IRS. Thus, if you may have to pay estate 
tax, you should consider an alternative that keeps the value of the insurance 
proceeds out of your estates.
Ownership by a child or children
If you want to leave your life insurance proceeds to your adult children, you 
benefit from having them own the policy. As the policy isn’t part of your 
estate, the proceeds go to your children free of estate tax. Direct ownership 
is simpler than ownership through a trust, which is described later in this 
chapter.
At the same time, your children have to pay the premiums for the policy. 
Although you can gift them the money for the premiums, taking advantage of 
your annual gift tax exemption, you can’t pay the premiums directly. Direct 
payment will result in the IRS finding that you own the policy and including 
the proceeds in your estate. Thus, your children must be responsible enough 
to pay the premiums instead of pocketing or spending the money.
You should reconsider having your children own your policy if you don’t 
want them to take and keep the life insurance proceeds. If you imagine them 
using the insurance proceeds to support your spouse or to pay certain debts 
of your estate, think again. Although many (perhaps most) children will abide 
by your wishes, the money is theirs. They’re entitled to keep it.
Ownership by a qualified plan
A qualified plan is a type of retirement savings plan that provides for the 
deferment of tax and tax-free appreciation of assets held within the plan. 
These plans must meet legal criteria defined by federal tax law, generally 
Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

235
 Chapter 16: Life Insurance: Making Sure It Doesn’t Backfire
Paying for life insurance through your qualified plan may seem like a good 
idea. After all, if you pay your premiums with pretax dollars or get a tax 
deduction, you enjoy substantial upfront savings. The downside is that your 
death benefit is subject to state and federal income tax.
Ownership by a trust
So you want to avoid estate taxes, but still maintain some amount of control 
over how your insurance benefits are used and distributed after your death? 
Then you need to consider having an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) 
own your life insurance policy.
Note that word irrevocable: Once you create the ILIT and it acquires an insur-
ance policy on your life, you can’t change your mind. Don’t expect that you’ll 
be trustee of your own ILIT, as your ability to control the trust is considered 
to be an incident of ownership of the insurance policy, such that your ILIT is 
included in your estate. You also can’t change the beneficiaries of an irrevo-
cable trust, even if, for example, you divorce your spouse.
You can fund your ILIT by:
 
 Transferring an existing policy into your trust
 
 Buying a new policy
The transfer of an existing life insurance policy is subject to a federal restric-
tion, such that if you die within three years of the transfer your life insurance, 
proceeds are counted as part of your estate. Thus, a transfer is best done 
when you’re younger and healthy.
To purchase a new life insurance policy, you transfer money into your ILIT, 
and the trustee obtains the policy and pays the premiums. The trust is 
named as the owner of the new policy, not you. You can transfer additional 
funds into your ILIT for the premiums as they become due.
 
Your contributions to your ILIT are subject to gift taxes, but you can avoid 
them by keeping your contributions within your $12,000 annual gift tax exclu-
sion. You can also apply part of your $1 million lifetime gift tax exemption.
ILITs are very effective tax avoidance tools, and the IRS is hostile to them. 
Also, administrative costs can be high. It’s important to set up an ILIT cor-
rectly, so enlisting the help of an estate planning professional will help you 
avoid unnecessary expenses and withstand IRS scrutiny.

Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
Designating Beneficiaries 
for Your Insurance Policy
When you fill out your insurance application, you’ll find a blank space for you 
to designate your beneficiary. You may not have thought much about who to 
pick. If you’re married, your first thought is probably to name your spouse 
as your primary beneficiary, and your children as contingent beneficiaries in 
case your spouse dies before you do.
But the choice is more complicated than you think. You need to consider fac-
tors such as the age of your beneficiary, how your choice may affect estate 
tax liability, and whether you want your beneficiary to receive a large lump 
sum payout.
Life insurance proceeds are often said to be tax free to your estate. This ref-
erence is to income tax. Unless you’re careful, the proceeds of your life insur-
ance policy will be subject to estate tax.
If you designate your spouse as beneficiary, your U.S. citizen spouse benefits 
from an unlimited marital deduction so that no estate taxes are owed on your 
insurance proceeds. You may also get a tax advantage and create an income 
stream for your surviving spouse if you direct the proceeds into a charitable 
trust. The following sections discuss the tax advantages and disadvantages of 
specific beneficiaries.
 
When choosing beneficiaries and contingent beneficiaries, sometimes you 
have to consider the unthinkable. In one case, a divorced mother and her three 
young children were killed in a car accident. The mother had named her chil-
dren as the beneficiary of her life insurance. As you might expect, her children 
did not have wills, so the insurance proceeds became part of their intestate 
estate. Their legal heir was their father, who was way behind in his child sup-
port. Needless to say, that was not what the mother would have wanted. This 
outcome could have been prevented had she named a contingent beneficiary 
for her life insurance, or if her beneficiary were a trust created for the benefit of 
her children. With a trust, had the children survived, she could also have pre-
vented her ex-husband from becoming the custodian of the insurance proceeds.
Spouse
Under the unlimited marital deduction, everything you leave to your U.S. citi-
zen spouse is inherited free of estate taxes. Thus, when your spouse receives 
your life insurance benefits, no estate tax is due.

237
 Chapter 16: Life Insurance: Making Sure It Doesn’t Backfire
If you name your spouse as beneficiary, remember the following:
 
 Your spouse may die before you do.
 
 Your spouse’s estate may have to pay estate taxes.
But don’t overlook these potential pitfalls:
 
 The $10 million policy payout your spouse receives is tax-free, but when 
she dies, the tax man will be looking for a share.
 
 The proceeds are subject to the claims of your spouse’s creditors.
 
 If your spouse remarries, her subsequent spouse can make claims 
against the money and may inherit part or all of the money when your 
spouse dies.
Naming an alternate beneficiary will ensure that your life insurance proceeds 
go to your intended recipient. But remember, your other beneficiaries don’t 
enjoy the unlimited marital deduction, and your estate may owe taxes on the 
insurance proceeds.
Child or children
You get no estate tax benefit from leaving your insurance proceeds to your 
children. But if your estate (including the insurance proceeds) isn’t large 
enough to owe estate taxes, or if you want to designate your children despite 
estate tax exposure, you may do so anyway. As with your spouse, once your 
children receive the money, it’s subject to potential claims by their spouses 
and creditors.
 
Be careful about designating your minor children as life insurance beneficia-
ries. Your children will require a court-appointed guardian to manage their 
money until they reach the age of 18.
Also, don’t forget that your estate pays your estate taxes, not your children. 
Make sure that your estate has the capacity to pay its taxes, including taxes 
on the life insurance payout.
Another individual
Perhaps you don’t have a spouse or children. You can name any person you 
want as your life insurance beneficiary, including your parents, a sibling, or 
another relative. You can choose a friend, former teacher, or even somebody 
you randomly pick from the phone book. Whomever you choose, if your 
estate owes taxes, payment will be out of your estate’s assets and not the 
insurance payout.

238
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
Multiple beneficiaries
You have considerable flexibility in designating a beneficiary for your insur-
ance. In addition to a specific individual, you can identify more than one 
person as co-beneficiaries of your policy. You can also designate a class of 
people, such as my children or my grandchildren, as beneficiary.
A trust
If you direct your life insurance proceeds into your living trust or a testamen-
tary trust (one created by your will), your trust will manage those proceeds 
pursuant to your instruction. This approach can be particularly beneficial if:
 
 Your spouse needs help managing money.
 
 You want the proceeds to benefit your minor children, but prefer that 
the money be held and managed by your chosen trustee rather than a 
court-appointed conservator.
 
 You don’t want your heirs to receive the payout from your policy in a 
single lump sum.
 
The proceeds will be part of your estate and subject to estate tax.
Another option is to name a charitable remainder trust as the beneficiary of 
your life insurance. You transfer ownership of assets into the trust, and it cre-
ates an income stream for a designated period of up to 20 years. If you create 
a charitable remainder trust for the benefit of your spouse, you guarantee 
your spouse an income during the term of the trust. Any income tax payable 
by your spouse is deferred until each payment is made.
Using insurance to equalize inheritances
You may want to leave a large asset to a par-
ticular heir, but not be able to make similar 
bequests to your other heirs. Life insurance can 
help bridge the gap.
For example, you may have a child who has 
taken over the family business, and you want 
that child to inherit the business. You may have 
a child who has moved into your home to care 
for you, or who needs a stable residence, and 
intend to leave your home to that child. You can 
use life insurance to provide an equivalent gift 
to your other children.
Life insurance may also be useful if you have 
remarried and have children from the prior mar-
riage. You want to leave your home to your new 
spouse, or perhaps only a life estate in your 
home, but that means your children won’t inherit 
the home for many years after your death. You 
can use life insurance to provide an immediate 
inheritance to your children.

239
 Chapter 16: Life Insurance: Making Sure It Doesn’t Backfire
Although a charitable remainder trust is irrevocable, if you use life insur-
ance fund it at the time of your death, you can change your mind at any time 
during your life. When the trust ends or your spouse dies, the trust’s assets 
go to a designated charity or charities. By virtue of that charitable donation, 
this trust can help you reduce your estate taxes, if your estate is likely to pay 
them. Chapter 12 discusses charitable remainder trusts in more detail.
 
If you have a noncitizen spouse, you can use a qualified domestic trust 
(QDOT) to postpone estate tax. Your noncitizen spouse can receive distribu-
tions of income from the QDOT without paying estate tax. Any distributions of 
principal are subject to estate tax.
Your estate
Your life insurance proceeds become part of your probate estate if:
 
 You name your estate as your beneficiary
 
 You fail to name a beneficiary for your policy
 
 Your beneficiary, and any contingent beneficiaries, die before you, in 
some cases.
Life insurance can be useful to pay the financial obligations of your estate, 
including debts, funeral costs, costs of administration, income taxes, and 
estate taxes. Life insurance proceeds paid into your estate are applied by 
your personal representative to satisfy your estate’s obligations. Any remain-
ing funds are distributed to your heirs in accord with your will.
Possible estate tax issues
Life insurance proceeds paid into your estate will increase its size. In some 
cases, that increase will cause your estate to have to pay estate taxes. If the 
value of your estate already exceeds your estate tax exemption, your entire 
life insurance benefit may be taxed.
If you intend to purchase life insurance to cover estate tax, you should do so 
early. If your life insurance is owned by an ILIT for three or more years before 
your death, the proceeds of your policy aren’t part of your estate. If you pur-
chase life insurance within three years of your death, it’s likely to be more 
expensive, and you can’t avoid estate taxes. (For more information on ILITs, 
see Chapter 12).
 
The interplay of life insurance with federal estate tax laws is complex. You must 
take care that your estate tax plan is effective and that it also achieves your per-
sonal estate planning goals. Consult with an estate planning professional.

240
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
Probate issues
If your life insurance benefits are paid into your estate, the proceeds are 
distributed in accord with your will. If you haven’t executed a will or don’t 
provide for the distribution of the proceeds within your will or through a 
residuary clause, the proceeds will be distributed under your state’s intes-
tate succession laws (as if you have no will). For more discussion of probate 
court proceedings, see Chapter 10.
You should designate beneficiaries and contingent beneficiaries for your 
insurance policies. In some cases, you may choose to designate multiple con-
tingent beneficiaries. You should also include a residuary clause in your will, 
directing the distribution of any assets remaining in your estate after your 
bills have been paid and your specific bequests have been distributed.

Chapter 17
Your Castle: How It’s Owned 
Makes a Huge Difference
In This Chapter
 Owning a home with or without others
 Providing for the inheritance of your home
 Avoiding problems with joint ownership and life estates
 Planning for investment and business properties
You may own your home in a variety of ways, either alone or with others. 
Your home may take a number of forms, including a single-family dwell-
ing, condo, co-op, boat, or manufactured home. You may also own your home 
with others, including your spouse or a domestic partner.
The type of home you own and the manner in which you own it may create 
tax concerns and influence whether you leave your home to your heirs 
through your will or through a trust. You face additional estate planning 
issues if you want your domestic partner to inherit your home.
In addition to your home, you may own other real estate. Your estate can 
face significant tax issues if you don’t plan for inheritance of your vacation 
home, business or investment property, or farmland. You also may disrupt 
the operation of your business.
House, Condo, Co-op, or More: Exploring 
the Types of Residential Properties
If you’re like most people, your home is your largest asset. When you con-
sider mortgage payments, upkeep, insurance, and utility bills, it’s also prob-
ably the source of your most significant expenses.

242
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
You have a great many housing options to choose from. Depending upon 
your budget and personal preferences, your primary choices are a single-
family home, townhouse or row home, condominium, or co-op. You can also 
purchase a manufactured home or even live in a houseboat.
Most residential properties are roughly equal for estate planning purposes. 
The greatest difference comes from cooperative housing, where you can have 
significant restrictions on who may own your shares, or manufactured homes 
and houseboats, which are forms of personal property.
The single-family home
A single-family home is a housing unit that provides living space for one 
home or family. Single-family homes fall into two general categories:
 
 Detached homes don’t touch any adjacent building and stand upon their 
own piece of land.
 
 Attached homes, such as row houses, townhouses, and duplexes, have 
an independent outside entrance and are separated from neighbor-
ing structures by walls that extend from the roof to the basement or 
foundation. You own the land under your home. You share at least one 
wall with your neighbors, so you may experience noise issues that you 
wouldn’t have with a detached home.
Row houses and townhouses are often regulated by homeowner’s associa-
tions. Owners pay monthly fees to the association. The fees may cover a 
broad range of services, including exterior maintenance, snow removal, and 
lawn care, or may be more narrowly focused on structural issues that affect 
adjoining homes, such as roof maintenance. The association may place 
restrictions on modification of the appearance of the external appearance of 
your home and yard.
A community of detached homes may also have a homeowner’s association, 
which may maintain common areas or buildings, restrict changes to the 
exterior of your home, maintain private roads within the community, provide 
security, or perform similar tasks desired by the community.
Within the constraints of homeowner’s association rules and local zoning 
ordinances, your home is your castle. For example, you can generally paint 
it whatever color you choose or, with appropriate building permits, install a 
pool or add an addition. You’re typically responsible for all maintenance and 
yard work.

243
 Chapter 17: Your Castle: How It’s Owned Makes a Huge Difference
The condominium
When you buy a condominium, or condo, you’re buying the interior space 
of a building, but not the exterior structure or the land upon which it 
sits. Condominiums can take the form of apartment blocks, townhouses, 
duplexes, or even detached homes.
A condominium community is governed by a condo association, pursuant to 
written bylaws. The condo owners ordinarily elect the association’s board of 
directors.
Condo owners pay fees to the association, which are used to maintain the 
exterior structure, common areas and buildings, and any recreational facili-
ties offered by the condominium community and to build a cash reserve for 
future needs. If cash reserves aren’t sufficient, the condo association may 
charge a special assessment to cover certain expenditures, such as roof 
replacement.
The condo association performs all exterior maintenance, including lawn 
care, snow removal, and pool maintenance. The condo association may also 
provide heating, cooling, and water.
You’re responsible for all interior maintenance for your home. You should 
expect to be forbidden from making any structural changes to your home 
(such as the removal of a wall) that the condo association hasn’t approved.
 
Some condominium associations permit owners to rent their units to tenants. 
This policy can make a condo community resemble an apartment complex. 
Before you buy a condo, you should ask about rental policies and talk to mem-
bers of the community about their experiences.
Condominiums often take longer to sell than single-family homes.
Housing cooperatives (co-ops)
A typical housing cooperative is a nonprofit corporation, organized for the 
democratic management of residential housing. The cooperative may restrict 
who may reside within the community (for example, a senior housing coop-
erative).
If you’re a member of a housing cooperative, you own shares of the coopera-
tive and get to vote in certain management decisions. Each month, you pay 
a fee, contributing to the co-op’s operating expenses. Provided you abide by 
community rules, the shares give you the right to live within the cooperative, 
but you don’t actually own real estate.

244
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
Your equity grows in one of three ways:
 
 In a leasing cooperative, the cooperative leases its premises. You thus 
have no equity in the real estate and get no equity growth. You may be 
entitled to a share of any cash reserves that accumulate during your 
period of ownership.
 
 In a limited equity cooperative, you’re restricted in what you will receive 
for your shares. Often the limits are described in the co-op’s bylaws.
 
 In a market rate cooperative, you’re free to sell your shares for whatever a 
seller is willing to pay. Appreciation may be comparable to a condominium.
When your residence is a manufactured 
home or boat
A houseboat or manufactured home is a form of personal property, not 
real estate. If you put your manufactured home on real estate that you own, 
you should be able to convert the home to real estate so that it no longer 
requires its own separate title.
Depending upon the policies of your state, title to your manufactured home 
is probably issued by the state department of motor vehicles, in the same 
manner as a car, or by the department of housing. Boat titles are normally 
issued by a state’s department of motor vehicles.
If a co-owner is named on the title to your manufactured home or boat, 
that person will ordinarily be treated as a joint tenant and will receive your 
ownership share when you die. Otherwise, you’re ordinarily free to leave 
your interest in personal property to whomever you choose and may do so 
through either a will or trust.
Ownership of Your Residence
When you plan your estate, the manner in which you own your home will 
affect your estate plan. Some forms of ownership result in automatic inheri-
tance by your spouse or co-owner. Others require that your property pass 
through probate.
Ownership by one person: Sole ownership
As the sole owner of your home, you have the general right to get a mortgage, 
refinance, sell your home, and leave your home to whomever you choose.

245
 Chapter 17: Your Castle: How It’s Owned Makes a Huge Difference
Yet even with sole ownership, your ability to choose your heir may be limited 
by marriage or family status:
 
 Some states will permit your wife to claim a life estate in your real property.
 
 Some states restrict your ability to leave your residence to anyone other 
than your surviving spouse or dependent children.
Chapter 8 discusses the impact of state law on your estate plan.
Ownership by two or more people
Leaving marital interests aside for the moment, as an individual, you can own 
real property with other people:
 
 As tenants in common: You own your share of the property indepen-
dent of your co-owners’ interest. Co-owners may own shares that differ 
in size. When you die, your share of the real estate is part of your estate 
and is distributed to your heirs.
 
 As joint tenants: You share equal ownership with two or more people 
with rights passing to surviving owners
Joint tenancy
To create a joint tenancy, the co-owners must share four unities:
 
 Time: The joint tenants’ interest must be created at the same time.
 
 Title: All joint tenants must have the same title interest in the property.
 
 Interest: All joint tenants must share the same interest in the property.
 
 Possession: All joint tenants must have equal rights to possess the 
entire property.
If any one of these elements isn’t present, the joint tenancy fails, and the 
owners become tenants in common.
A joint tenancy can be broken and become a tenancy in common if one of 
the joint tenants sells her interest in the property to a third party. Some 
states permit a joint tenant to break a joint tenancy by executing a document 
expressing that intention. In some states, a joint tenancy is broken if one joint 
tenant obtains a mortgage on the jointly owned property.
In a joint tenancy, each co-owner has a right of survivorship. When you die, 
your interest in the property automatically passes to the other co-owner (or 
owners).

246
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
Tenancy by the entirety
A tenancy by the entirety is a form of joint tenancy available only to married 
couples. Its creation requires all four unities described in the preceding sec-
tion, in addition to the fifth unity of marriage. Not all states recognize tenancy 
by the entirety.
Unlike a regular joint tenancy, a tenancy by the entirety may be broken only 
with the consent of both parties or by divorce. In most states, after divorce, a 
tenancy by the entirety becomes a tenancy in common.
The biggest advantages of a tenancy by the entirety arise in collections or 
bankruptcy. A tenancy by the entirety can protect your property from the 
claims of your spouse’s debtors and may provide significant protection of the 
property if one spouse files for bankruptcy protection.
Married couples purchasing real estate together will usually choose to own 
as joint tenants or, if allowed, tenancy by the entirety. If you’re purchasing 
an investment property with a partner, you’d ordinarily choose to be tenants 
in common. If you choose to jointly own real estate with somebody other 
than your spouse, even a relative, you should consider entering a contract 
describing your respective rights to the property, payment of mortgage pay-
ments, taxes, maintenance, and other expenses, and what happens if one of 
you wants to sell the property.
Life estates
A life estate describes an ownership interest measured by the duration of the 
owner’s life. The owner of a life estate is called a life tenant, and the people 
who receive title upon the life tenant’s death are called remaindermen. A life 
estate is irrevocable.
If you create a life tenancy for yourself in your home and designate your chil-
dren as remaindermen, normally:
 
 You have the exclusive right to the use and possession of your home.
 
 You’re responsible for payment of routine maintenance, insurance, 
taxes, and the mortgage interest.
 
 Your remaindermen are responsible to pay the portion of the mortgage 
payment that is applied to principal.
Like a joint tenancy, title to your home passes to your remaindermen without 
going through probate.

247
 Chapter 17: Your Castle: How It’s Owned Makes a Huge Difference
 
Life estates are often used as an estate planning tool for second marriages, 
with the second spouse receiving a life estate and children from a prior mar-
riage being designated as remaindermen.
Community property laws
In a community property state, if you purchase real estate during your mar-
riage, your spouse has an automatic interest in the real estate. (Community 
property states are listed in Chapter 3.) The following exceptions commonly 
apply:
 
 Property that you receive as a gift or inheritance remains your separate 
property.
 
 If you purchase the property with your own resources, acquired before 
the marriage, you’ll likely be able to claim it as separate property.
If you divorce, your spouse can claim a half-interest in all community property.
In some community property states, your surviving spouse has a right of sur-
vivorship. In other community property states, you’re free to leave your half-
interest to whomever you wish.
Special issues for domestic partners
Although some states are expanding the rights available to registered domes-
tic partners, in most states, you’re treated as unrelated to your domestic 
partner.
If your state doesn’t grant property rights to domestic partners, you’re not 
eligible for a domestic partnership, or you choose not to enter a domestic 
partnership, you can still jointly own a home. For example, you can own 
real estate as joint tenants, tenants in common, or even through a trust. But 
remember:
 
 You can’t rely upon divorce laws and courts to separate your property if 
you break up.
 
 If you can’t agree how your shared real estate will be divided, legal actions 
for sale or partition of real estate can be costly and time-consuming.
 
 If you don’t create a plan for your partner to inherit your property, 
it may end up being inherited by your legal heirs, not including your 
domestic partner.

248
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
If your state doesn’t offer property rights to domestic partners, I recommend 
that you enter into a contract for any shared real estate, including:
 
 How the costs of ownership, including the mortgage, utilities, insurance, 
and maintenance, are to be divided
 
 Who may remain in the home if you separate
 
 What will happen to the property if you break up, including how it will 
be sold and how the proceeds of the sale will be divided between you
 
 Any right to buy out your partner’s interest in the property, and how 
that interest will be valued
 
 Your rights if your partner dies, and you end up jointly owning your 
home with your partner’s heirs
Should Ownership of Your Home 
Be Held by Your Trust?
If your home is your largest asset, you want to avoid probate, and your living 
trust is the best tool for avoiding probate, you should immediately transfer 
your home into your living trust, right? Perhaps not. You may not want your 
home to be owned by your trust if:
 
 You plan to sell your home. Although your trust can sell your home, if 
you have short-term plans to sell your home, you may want to skip the 
step of transferring the property into the trust.
 
 You may file for bankruptcy. If your home is owned by your trust at 
the time of your bankruptcy, you may lose your homestead exemption. 
You’ll need to transfer your house back out of your revocable living 
trust before you file bankruptcy.
Due to the nature of a revocable living trust, you can regain title to your 
home simply by transferring the home back out of the trust or by revoking 
the trust.
 
Needless to say, if you’re considering transferring your home into an irrevo-
cable trust, you need to be very confident that your plans and wishes for your 
home won’t change.

249
 Chapter 17: Your Castle: How It’s Owned Makes a Huge Difference
The Drawbacks Of Adding 
Your Heirs to the Title
You may have heard that you can avoid the trouble of estate planning simply 
by adding your heirs to the title of your property. The rationale is this: If you 
add somebody to your property as a joint tenant, that person will automati-
cally gain full ownership when you die. The same is true if you title property 
over to your heirs and retain a life estate.
 
You create serious risks for yourself by using a joint tenancy or life estate as 
a substitute for estate planning. You may also increase tax exposure for your 
heirs. Odds are, you’re much better off using a living trust.
The cons outweigh the pros
Of course, adding your desired heir as a joint owner of your home brings 
potential benefits:
 
 Probate avoidance: Your child inherits your home without its going 
through probate.
 
 Simplicity: You can achieve joint tenancy or create a life estate simply 
by preparing and filing a quitclaim deed.
 
 
However, you can achieve the same benefits through a living trust. As a trust 
allows you to avoid the pitfalls of joint ownership, I encourage you to choose 
that alternative.
On the other hand, the dangers often exceed the benefits. For joint owner-
ship, in the most common scenario, you add your child to the title of your 
home. These pitfalls apply to any joint owners you add:
 
 Your child may add her spouse to the title without your knowledge or 
consent.
 
 Your child gains equal rights to the use and enjoyment of your home.
 
 You expose your property to your children’s creditors. If your child falls 
into debt, is sued after a car accident, or goes bankrupt, your child’s 
creditors may try to take your home.
 
 You can’t borrow against your home without your child’s permission 
and possibly also the permission of your child’s spouse. If you want to 
refinance, take out a home equity line to fund repairs or improvements, 
or want to use your home to finance your dream vacation, you need 
your child to cooperate.

250
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
 
 In most cases, you can’t sell your home without your child’s permission 
and possibly also the permission of your child’s spouse. If you want to 
move into a smaller home, to a different state, or into a retirement com-
munity, your child can say no. You can bring a lawsuit against your child 
to force the sale of your home, but your child will be entitled to a share 
of the proceeds from the sale.
 
 Your child’s spouse may try to claim an interest in your home. If your 
child divorces, your child’s spouse may claim that the joint interest in 
the home is a marital asset and should be divided in the divorce.
 
You may have the idea that the joint title is only for convenience and add your 
child to the title with the understanding that the child will share the property 
equally with your other children when you die. Your child has no obligation to 
carry out your wishes— even if you spell out your wishes in your will — and in 
many cases, a child will keep the house despite a parent’s wishes.
For life estates, the most common scenario involves your giving yourself and 
your spouse a life tenancy in your real estate, and adding one or more of your 
children as your remaindermen, designating them to receive the property 
when your life estates end. A life estate carries some of the main drawbacks 
of joint ownership:
 
 You should not expect to be able to borrow against your life estate.
 
 You can no longer sell your home without your children’s cooperation 
and consent.
Possible tax consequences
The two leading tax concerns from adding an heir to your title are
 
 Increased capital gains tax exposure for your heirs (see Chapter 6)
 
 Potential loss of an estate tax exemption for your estate
When you add somebody to your title as a joint tenant with the right of survi-
vorship, normally only half the value of the asset is stepped up at the time of 
your death (see Chapter 6). Thus, as compared to inheritance, the joint ten-
ancy can significantly increase your heir’s capital gains tax exposure.
Consider also what happens if your heir dies before you. The IRS will pre-
sume that the entire value of your home belongs in your heir’s estate and, 
in some cases, you may have to fight hard to avoid having your heir’s estate 
held liable for estate taxes on your home.

251
 Chapter 17: Your Castle: How It’s Owned Makes a Huge Difference
Estate tax exemptions
Did you own a home before you married? If you have a large estate and add 
your spouse as a joint tenant, you may lose your ability to take advantage of 
your estate tax exemption. Although your spouse will receive jointly owned 
property tax-free, all the property passing into your spouse’s estate is poten-
tially subject to estate tax.
 
If you place your separately owned home into a bypass trust, you can take 
advantage of your own estate tax exemption when you die while keeping your 
home out of your spouse’s estate, potentially doubling the assets you and 
your spouse can leave to your heirs tax-free. See Chapter 6 for a greater dis-
cussion of the estate tax planning.
Possible Medicaid consequences
When you apply for Medicaid benefits, your homestead exemption shields 
your primary residence from being counted toward your Medicaid eligibility, 
provided you intend to return to your home, or if you have a spouse or minor 
child residing in your home.
Adding a joint tenant to your home, other than a spouse, within the 36-month 
period before you apply for benefits can make you ineligible during a penalty 
period based upon the value of your home and the ownership interest of 
your joint tenant.
If you receive Medicaid benefits, when you die your state will attempt to 
recoup the cost of those benefits from your estate. In some states, Medicaid 
recovery is made only against your probate estate. As your joint title holder 
receives ownership of your home without going through probate, you may 
be able to avoid Medicaid Recovery against your home by adding a joint title 
holder.
 
Don’t assume that your joint owner will get this benefit. In many states, 
despite joint ownership, your home will be treated as if it’s part of your estate 
and be subject to Medicaid recovery. State budget problems are inspiring 
states to be more aggressive about Medicaid recovery, so you can expect that 
practice to grow.
Leaving Real Property by Will or Trust
If you leave your real property to your heirs through your will or a living 
trust, you can maintain the advantages of joint ownership but avoid the many 
risks of that approach. Whether you use a will or revocable living trust:

252
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
 
 You can change your mind. You can revoke or amend your living trust 
or will as you please.
 
 You can protect the home from your heirs’ creditors. For example, you 
can use an asset protection trust to leave your home to your child while 
protecting it from the reach of creditors or from the claim of a spouse in 
later divorce proceedings.
 
 You can create a bypass trust that keeps your home out of your spouse’s 
estate and take advantage of both marital estate tax deductions.
 
 Your heirs receive a step up in basis, to the value of your home at the 
time of your death.
You may also consider irrevocable trusts, such as the qualified personal 
residence trust (QPRT), which may avoid some of the problems of joint own-
ership, but you can’t change your mind once you transfer ownership of your 
home to an irrevocable trust. See Chapter 12 for a discussion of many popu-
lar varieties of trust.
Remembering Other Properties
Do you own land other than your primary residence? If so, don’t forget to 
include it in your estate plan.
If your other property is located in another state, your use of a trust can sim-
plify probate. If your real estate is held in a trust, no probate proceedings are 
necessary to pass your property to your heirs. If not, your estate is probated 
in your state of residence, but additional probate lawsuits must be filed in 
every state in which you own real property.
If you transfer any property other than your personal residence into a trust, 
beware of due on sale clauses in your mortgages. If you don’t have your mort-
gage lender’s permission for the transfer, this clause permits your lender to 
accelerate the loan and demand full payment.
 
For any property you hold, you must consider how your estate plan will affect 
your estate’s tax burden, control of the property, and exposure to creditors, 
as well as capital gains tax obligations for your heirs.
Vacation properties
You may feel a special attachment to your family’s vacation property and 
envision many generations of your family continuing to enjoy the property. 
But be aware of common problems that may arise:

253
 Chapter 17: Your Castle: How It’s Owned Makes a Huge Difference
 
 One of the co-owners is unable or unwilling to contribute to expenses, 
such as maintenance, insurance, and taxes.
 
 One co-owner wants to sell the property, and the others don’t, but the 
others can’t afford to buy out his share.
 
 One co-owner wants to keep the property, but can’t afford to buy out 
the other co-owners, who want to sell.
 
 Your family continues to grow, and your vacation home is no longer 
large enough for family gatherings, or disputes arise over scheduling 
access.
 
If you want to keep your vacation home within your family, discuss your plans 
with your heirs. You may discover that one of your children is much more 
interested in the vacation home than the others, so it makes more sense to 
simply leave the home to that child with your other children inheriting assets 
of equal value.
Investment properties
If you own investment property that you want to leave to your heirs, you 
need to consider the following:
 
 Estate taxes: Will the value of your investment property create estate 
tax liability for your estate?
 
 Division of the property among your heirs: Will you hold the properties 
in trust for your heirs? If you own multiple properties, will you distribute 
different properties among your heirs?
If your investment property is valuable and you expect to pay estate taxes, 
you should consider a Family Limited Partnership. (For more on Family 
Limited Partnerships, see Chapter 6.)
You can also utilize a trust to hold your investment property. You can define 
how the property will be managed, and how trust income will be distributed.
Be careful when distributing specific investment properties to your heirs. 
The relative values of any properties you own will change over time, includ-
ing after your death. Consider how those changes may affect the value of 
your bequests:
 
 Differences that arise before you die can create resentment when your 
children inherit unequally.
 
 Even if the properties are exactly equal in value after you die, vagaries of 
the real estate market may cause their values to diverge.

254
Part IV: Carrying Out the Intent of Your Will and Trust 
 
The child who receives the less valuable property may harbor resentment 
against you and against the child who received the more valuable property.
Business real estate
What about real estate owned by your business, such as a retail store or office 
space? If you own the land from which your business operates or own an office 
condo, you need to consider that real estate when creating your estate plan.
The first question is whether the real estate is owned by the business itself or 
by you and either used or leased by the business. If you have a corporation, 
LLC, or similar entity that owns the real estate, your business succession 
plan will encompass that real estate.
If your business isn’t incorporated or you own the real estate apart from your 
business, you need to make sure that you have an adequate estate and suc-
cession plan. If your business doesn’t already own the real estate, consider 
these approaches:
 
 If the business will falter or fail if it has to move, and you have not yet 
done so, consider executing a formal lease to protect the right of the 
business to remain on the premises.
 
 Consider selling the real estate to your business, with due consideration 
to the capital gains tax issues that may arise.
Business real estate is otherwise not much different from other investment 
property.
Farmland
Estate planning for a farm is a complex process and is best done in consulta-
tion with an estate planning professional. Creating a succession plan for the 
family farm usually requires a broad spectrum of estate planning tools:
 
 A business succession plan and gifting strategy, to transfer ownership 
of the business to your heirs while minimizing estate and capital gains 
taxes. See Chapter 6 for a discussion of tax planning tools.
 
 Life insurance, to cover the farm’s debts and estate taxes.
 
 Long-term care insurance, so that farm assets aren’t depleted to pay for 
your nursing home care.
 
 The use of trusts and possibly a Family Limited Partnership, to help pro-
vide financial stability for your family and a smooth transition of farm 
management. (See Chapter 6 for more on the Family Limited Partnership.)

255
 Chapter 17: Your Castle: How It’s Owned Makes a Huge Difference
If you own farmland that isn’t productive, consider also the prior discussion 
of estate planning for investment properties.
 
Whether or not your farmland is productive, if consistent with your goals, you 
should consider using an agricultural conservation easement. This easement 
reduces the value of farmland to your estate, while preventing it from being 
developed. You create restrictions on part or all of your farmland to protect 
resources such as wildlife habitat, water resources, scenery, or even to pre-
serve it as productive farmland, and then sell or donate the easement to a 
qualified conservation organization or public agency.
Although agricultural conservation easements are usually permanent, they 
may also be created for a fixed number of years. The restrictions created by 
the conservation easement hold down the value of your land by making it 
unsuitable for non-agricultural use.

Ten Common Will Mistakes
In This Chapter
 Avoiding having your will invalidated
 Keeping your bequests from failing
 Saving your estate (and heirs) time and money
I
f you’re reading this chapter, you’ve more than likely done the hard work 
of creating an estate plan and have written a will that reflects your goals. 
But will a mistake undo all your hard work? Will your heirs receive the inheri-
tances you intend for them? What if your heirs can’t even find your will?
Some mistakes create confusion or cause specific bequests to fail. Some 
mistakes cause your assets to be distributed in a manner you would regard 
as unfair and very different from what you have written in your will. Worse, 
some mistakes can completely invalidate your will.
This chapter describes common mistakes and how to avoid them.
Not Updating Your Will
Over the course of your life, you will experience changes in your personal 
relationships, possessions, and finances. Your will is like a photograph – a 
snapshot of your estate and your plans at a particular moment in time. You 
should review your will as a matter of course, every few years, to confirm 
that it remains consistent with your wishes.
Chapter 8 covers the reasons why you may need to update your will. Any 
time you go through a major life change, such as marriage, divorce or remar-
riage, you should update your will to avoid the following complications:
 
 A divorce is unlikely to invalidate your entire will, but it should invali-
date your ex-spouse’s inheritance. If that happens, your ex-spouse’s 
share will likely be distributed to your other heirs as if the ex-spouse 
died first. The result may be a distribution of your estate that is very dif-
ferent from what you intend.

260
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
 If you marry, your spouse will have inheritance rights under state law. 
If you don’t provide for your new spouse, expect that the court will do 
so out of your estate, which will dramatically change the distribution of 
your estate.
 
 If you have a child or adopt a child, after you draft your will, the child’s 
inheritance rights under law can be drastically different from what you 
would choose. In some cases, your new child may inherit significantly 
more than what your other children will inherit.
 
 If one of your heirs precedes you in death, have you provided for what 
will happen to their share of your estate? If not, you should update 
your will.
You should also review the people you designate as your primary and suc-
cessor personal representatives. Have your relationships with those people 
changed? Are they likely to outlive you? Are you still certain that they’re up 
to the task of administering your estate or that they’ll be capable of doing so 
years from now, after you die? If not, consider designating somebody else.
 
Do you change the batteries in your smoke detectors every year? You can also 
make that the day you review your will.
Being Too Specific in Your Bequests
Although it may seem at first that you can’t be too specific when writing 
your will, sometimes the opposite is true. Being too specific can be a big 
problem when
 
 Your assets or their values change.
 
 You list heirs you want to share in a bequest, and you omit a name or 
forget to amend your will to keep the list current.
 
 Your heirs change.
When you write your will, you may picture certain belongings going to a par-
ticular heir, or choose to leave specific parcels of real estate to your children. 
But what if the property is no longer part of your estate because you lost, sold, 
or broke it years before? Your bequest will fail, and your heir may take nothing.
 
If you make bequests of specific items or accounts, you should verify that you 
still have the asset you describe in your will. You should also consider any 
change in its value. If you do not, the person who was to receive that bequest 
may receive nothing at all or may receive something worth far less than you 
had intended.

261
 Chapter 18: Ten Commmon Will Mistakes
If the value of the bequest has changed, your heir may receive an inheritance 
significantly greater or substantially less than you intended. (You wrote a will 
in 1999 leaving one child your eBay stock and one child your Pets.com stock, 
equal in value at the time. The eBay stock is now worth millions, and the 
Pets.com stock is worth nothing.)
Another common error is to forget that the value of your estate will change 
over time, and to make specific bequests based upon the current value of 
your estate. Usually your estate will increase in value, but sometimes its 
value will go down.
If your estate is currently worth $250,000, you may be tempted to write a will 
leaving $50,000 to your brother and the rest of your estate to your children. 
Yet due to a prolonged illness, $200,000 of your estate is consumed by medi-
cal costs and nursing home care. After your brother inherits his $50,000, your 
children are left with nothing.
 
If you instead leave your brother 20 percent of your estate, although your 
children still inherit far less than you currently expect, they won’t be left with 
nothing. They’ll still receive 80 percent of your reduced estate.
When you’re leaving bequests to specific groups of people, such as your 
children or grandchildren, a will drafting error may omit a name, or a new 
grandchild may be born who is not included in your list. I know you’re think-
ing, “I could never make such a huge mistake,” but this mistake happens even 
in professionally prepared, carefully proofread wills.
 
Instead of naming individual heirs, consider making your bequest to the 
group. If you have four grandchildren, you can leave the gift “to my grandchil-
dren” instead of “to Jack, Jill, and Emma.” That way, the accidental omission 
of George won’t keep him from inheriting. Also, your will won’t need to be 
changed upon the birth of your fifth grandchild, Jacob.
Finally, keep in mind that a beneficiary of your will may die before you do. 
Consider designating a successor beneficiary for specific bequests that may 
otherwise become part of the residuary of your estate.
Forgetting to Address the 
Residuary of Your Estate
The residuary part of your estate is the amount left over after your bequests 
are distributed to your heirs. The two most likely sources are

262
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
 Assets you forgot to consider when you wrote your will.
 
 Property you acquired after you wrote your will.
 
 The remaining balance of funds you set aside for payment of your 
estate’s bills, costs, and taxes.
If you make no provision, these leftovers will pass to your heirs under your 
state’s laws of intestate succession, as if you had no will.
The solution is to always include a residuary clause that provides how you 
wish the residue of your estate to pass to your heirs.
Leaving Everything to Your Spouse
You want everything to go to your spouse when you die. You know that your 
gift to your spouse won’t be subject to inheritance taxes. So what can go 
wrong? If you have a large estate, you’re walking away from your estate tax 
exemption.
As of the time of this writing, your estate has a $2 million estate tax exemp-
tion, and your spouse’s estate also has a $2 million exemption. If you both 
take advantage of your exemptions, you can leave $4 million to your heirs 
without incurring estate taxes. If you instead leave everything to your 
spouse, your spouse will benefit only from her $2 million exemption, and 
up to $2 million of your combined estate will unnecessarily be subject to 
taxation.
 
The bypass trust is a common tool to take advantage of both exemptions 
while allowing your spouse to benefit from your entire estate. I discuss this 
trust in Chapter 12.
Leaving Nothing to Your Spouse
The state doesn’t want you to die and leave your spouse penniless. States 
have laws defining the amount a spouse is entitled to inherit from your 
estate, giving your spouse the option of choosing their legally defined inheri-
tance instead of the bequest you define in your will. Usually, the amount your 
spouse may claim is between one-third and one-half of your estate.

263
 Chapter 18: Ten Commmon Will Mistakes
 
If you leave your spouse too little, or nothing at all, you should expect your 
spouse to choose the larger inheritance allowed by law. That will wreak havoc 
with your other bequests.
If you intend to leave your spouse less than about half of your estate, you 
should ask a lawyer to advise you on your estate plan.
Including Items in Your Will That 
Pass Outside of Your Estate
Some of your assets never become part of your probated estate. Jointly held 
real estate will normally pass to the surviving owner without going through 
probate. The same is true for jointly held bank accounts.
Retirement savings accounts and pension plans with a designated beneficiary 
will pass to the beneficiary without going through probate. As long as you 
name a beneficiary other than your estate, the same is true for the proceeds 
of life insurance policies and annuities.
If an asset passes to a beneficiary outside of probate, you can’t direct the 
inheritance of that asset through your will.
 
If you leave your $100,000 bank account to your son and your $100,000 life 
insurance policy to your daughter, but your son is the designated beneficiary 
of your life insurance policy, your bequest to your daughter will fail and your 
son will get both your bank account and the insurance proceeds.
Improper Witnessing of Your Will
I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to properly execute your will. If 
you have gone through all the work of creating a will, the last thing you want 
to do is have it fail. Yet if you do not have your will properly witnessed, your 
will may be invalidated.
Common errors include
 
 Having an heir (or heirs) witness your will. Your witnesses should be 
impartial adults with nothing to gain from your estate.

264
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
 Signing your will at a different time than your witnesses, or having 
your witnesses sign at different times. Have everybody in the same 
room, and sign the will together.
 
 Improper notarization. If you execute a self-proving affidavit for your 
will so that your will is presumed valid by a probate court, improper 
notarization will cause the affidavit to fail. If you’re in Louisiana and 
don’t follow your state’s laws for proper execution of a will before a 
notary, your entire will may fail.
Chapter 7 discusses the proper execution of wills.
Losing Your Will (or Making 
It Impossible to Find)
If you’re drafting your own will, find a safe location for your will. If you keep 
your will at home, consider keeping it in a fire-resistant safe or lock box and 
make sure that your personal representative and heirs know where to find 
the key or combination.
 
I do not recommend storing your will in a safe deposit box. Your personal rep-
resentative needs the original will, and it may be weeks before your estate has 
access to its contents. If you keep your original will in a safe deposit box, at 
least make a photocopy to keep at home in a location known to your personal 
representative and heirs.
When your original will is lost, although the process can be difficult, you may 
be able to probate a copy of your will. If you have a lawyer draft your will, 
often the law office will keep a copy of your will on file. As long as your per-
sonal representative or your heirs know who drafted your will, they can get a 
copy from your lawyer. Don’t assume that your lawyer will preserve a copy of 
your will, as not all law offices do so.
Chapter 2 discusses the storage of your important documents in more detail.
Forgetting to Leave Good 
Financial Records
Your heirs know exactly where you keep your will. That’s great. But now 
that your estate needs to find your savings accounts, retirement accounts, 

265
 Chapter 18: Ten Commmon Will Mistakes
investments, creditors, and real estate holdings, where do they look? Where 
are your assets located? Do you have any insurance policies? Where did you 
store copies of your recent tax returns?
Make things easy on your heirs. Keep good financial records and make sure 
that your personal representative and heirs know where the records are 
stored.
 
If you keep even a set of simple records describing where your financial 
accounts are held and where your assets are located, it will be of considerable 
help to your personal representative and heirs as they probate your estate. 
List such assets and obligations as your savings and checking accounts, CDs, 
insurance policies, and credit cards. Remember to identify the financial insti-
tutions and account numbers.
Forgetting That Your Estate Needs Cash
Your estate will have bills to pay, including your own outstanding debts, 
funeral expenses, probate costs, taxes, and the fees of the professionals who 
perform work for your estate.
If your estate doesn’t have liquid assets (cash, or assets readily converted 
to cash) available, some of your other assets will have to be sold to pay the 
bills. That sale can significantly disrupt your estate plan. You may specify in 
your will the order in which assets are to be sold to pay bills.
 
If you’re concerned about your estate’s liquidity, you should consider pur-
chasing a life insurance policy sufficient to cover the debts of your estate.

Ten Reasons to Have a Trust
In This Chapter
 Avoiding probate court
 Managing investments and complex assets
 Getting your estate to your intended heirs
 Minimizing your estate’s taxes and expenses
You have certainly heard of revocable living trusts, but you may not be 
aware of the full range of benefits you can obtain by using trusts in your 
estate plan, or of the full range of trusts you may choose from. Trusts can 
help you plan for incapacity, control distribution of inheritances, avoid pro-
bate, and avoid taxes.
This chapter describes the top ten ways a trust can help you plan and struc-
ture your estate. (For more on trusts in general, see Part III.)
You Avoid Probate
Trusts aren’t submitted to probate court, and your trustee doesn’t require 
probate court approval to carry out your wishes. Thus, your use of a trust 
can help your estate plan remain private.
When your estate passes through probate, a public record is made of your will 
and of your assets and their worth. Anybody can look up your probate court file 
and learn the intimate details of your estate. Some law firms and financial plan-
ners use probate records to identify heirs and target them with sales pitches.
 
Don’t worry too much about privacy. Unless you’re a celebrity, it’s unlikely that 
anybody is going to have much interest in reading your will or reviewing a probate 
court’s inventory of your assets. Also, even with a living trust, you won’t com-
pletely avoid probate. You will have some assets that are not owned by the trust.

268
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Although small estates may qualify for simplified probate, and probate laws 
and their complexity differ in each state, most estates go through a full 
probate process, which usually takes between six months and two years to 
complete. Particularly complicated estates may take longer. Distributing your 
assets through a trust should prevent this type of delay.
The more complicated your estate plan is, the more money you’re likely to 
save by choosing a living trust in addition to a will. But keep in mind that 
trusts also have administration costs, and those costs can easily equal (and 
sometimes exceed) the cost of probate.
 
Do you want to have the distribution of your assets supervised by a court? 
A trustee has a great deal of discretion in managing (and thus in potentially 
mismanaging) your assets. Probate court supervision may help prevent your 
assets from being lost to mistake or misappropriation. At the same time, 
before you choose to forego a trust, don’t forget to consider the costs of the 
probate to your estate.
You’re Prepared for Incapacity
When you create a living trust, you structure your assets in the manner of 
your choosing. You choose your own trustee (and successor trustee), and 
when your trust comes into effect, the trustee manages your assets consis-
tent with the terms of your trust.
In a living trust, your assets are already structured for your benefit, with a 
trustee and successor of your choosing. Although a durable power of attor-
ney permits your agent to manage your financial affairs, the power of attor-
ney will usually contain far less detail than a living trust. The detail of a living 
trust helps ensure that your trustee will know and follow your wishes and 
can make it more difficult for your trustee to misappropriate funds.
Your living trust may also provide for how your business interests are to be 
managed during your incapacity. If you own a small business, this provision 
can be crucial to keeping the business open in the event of an unexpected 
health crisis.
If you have both a living trust and a durable power of attorney, you can 
be pretty confident that your assets are protected and will be used as you 
intend in the event of your incapacity.
 
If you don’t utilize a trust and rely only upon a durable power of attorney, you 
still leave the management of your estate to somebody else’s discretion. Your 
assets may end up being managed by somebody appointed by a court. Also, 
sometimes a financial institution refuses to recognize a durable power of attor-
ney. If your assets have been transferred into your trust, your trustee should 
not encounter that problem.

269
 Chapter 19: Ten Reasons to Have a Trust
You Avoid a Will Contest
When you submit a will to probate, a will contest may occur. In a will contest, 
the person challenging your will attempts to demonstrate that at a particular 
point of time you weren’t competent to execute your will, or that you were 
being pressured or tricked into signing a will you didn’t really want.
While will contests are not common and are usually unsuccessful, they can 
delay the distribution of your estate. Your heirs may settle the contest, giving 
up part of their rightful inheritance just to save litigation costs and to be able 
to move on with their lives.
Challenging a living trust is much more difficult. The person bringing the 
contest must establish that you remained incompetent or that any duress or 
confusion continued not only when you executed the trust, but also at each 
point in time when you transferred assets into or out of your trust or made 
management or investment decisions relating to trust assets.
 
While a will contest can tie up your entire estate until the contest is resolved, 
your living trust becomes operational upon your death. Your trustee manages 
your assets the way you intended while the litigation continues, meaning that 
your surviving spouse and children benefit from your trust despite any litigation.
Some law firms will litigate a will contest on a contingency fee, taking as their 
fee a percentage of any money they obtain from the estate. This approach 
can make it “cheap” for somebody to contest your will, as no legal fees are 
paid up front. Trust litigation is much more costly and complicated. The 
person challenging your trust can expect to incur substantial legal fees.
You Protect Your Heirs
Sometimes your heirs will not have much experience with money or will be 
too young or otherwise unable to manage their own financial affairs.
Consider the following illustrations of when your heirs may benefit from the 
additional protection of a trust:
 
 If you’ve always managed the household finances, your spouse may 
benefit from having the family assets managed by a trustee. Discuss this 
issue with your spouse. You shouldn’t underestimate your spouse’s abil-
ity to learn how to manage a household budget.
 
 When leaving money to your children or grandchildren, you may want to 
limit their access to their inheritances until they’re out of college. If you 
simply leave bequests by will, they get a lump sum inheritance usually 

270
Part V: The Part of Tens 
when they reach adulthood. A trust lets you decide how and when they 
receive their inheritances.
 
 If your child has special needs and receives government benefits, a trust 
can protect their inheritance from being taken by the government as 
reimbursement for public assistance.
 
It makes sense to protect your heirs, but don’t overprotect them. No matter 
how carefully you try to anticipate their future financial needs and problems, 
you can’t predict the future. Tying up your bequests with conditions and con-
tingencies may prevent your heirs from getting the full benefit of their inheri-
tances or block their access to funds at times of need.
You Can Protect Estate Assets 
from Creditors and Lawsuits
Putting your assets into a living trust doesn’t protect them from your credi-
tors, but you can protect beneficiaries from their creditors. You can also 
avoid the dangers of adding your heirs as joint owners of your property and 
financial accounts.
If your child is in financial trouble, the bequest you leave may go directly to 
your child’s creditors. You can protect your child’s inheritance by using a 
spendthrift trust, which prevents your child from borrowing against the trust 
and protects the trust’s assets against your child’s creditors. (Spendthrift 
trusts are discussed in Chapter 12.)
 
You may be tempted to try to avoid the need for an estate plan by simply 
adding your children as joint owners of your real estate and bank accounts. 
But what if your child gets into financial difficulties or goes into bankruptcy? 
If your child is a co-owner, your child’s creditors will pursue your home and 
your savings to pay your child’s bills.
A revocable living trust provides benefits similar to having your child on 
the title, but your child’s financial troubles won’t jeopardize your estate. A 
transfer of title is extremely hard to undo, but you can amend or revoke your 
living trust any time you choose.
You Plan for Second (and Third, 
and Fourth) Marriages
If you don’t have children, remarriage shouldn’t complicate your estate. Rather 
than leaving your estate to your former spouse, it goes to your new spouse. But if 

271
 Chapter 19: Ten Reasons to Have a Trust
you have children from a prior relationship or from more than one relationship, 
your estate is suddenly complicated. Without an estate plan, money you planned 
for your children to inherit may instead end up with your stepchildren.
In addition, the subsequent marriage may not be yours. If you die, your 
spouse may marry again. If your spouse dies or divorces, and the new spouse 
claims a share of their estate, what happens to your estate and to money you 
had hoped to go to your children? What if your spouse has children with the 
new spouse and chooses to leave your estate to them?
You can employ a trust to ensure that your spouse is well supported, but 
that the balance of your estate ultimately goes to your children. The Qualified 
Terminable Interest Property (QTIP) trust, also known as a marital trust, is 
used often for this purpose. With a QTIP trust, you can benefit from your assets 
during your life and support your spouse after your death, yet still control how 
your assets are distributed. This type of trust is discussed in Chapter 12.
You Plan for the Future of Your Business
If you own a business that you intend to leave to your heirs, trusts can help 
you avoid estate taxes and keep the business up and running after your death 
or incapacity.
The use of a revocable living trust can provide for the continued operation of the 
business during succession, without the interruption that may result from pro-
bate. If you want to get more complicated — and you probably do — trusts may
 
 Reduce the taxable value of your business interests to your estate.
 
 Help you give shares of the business to your children.
 
 Help maintain liquidity for the business in the event of your death.
 
Business succession planning can be very complex. You will almost always 
benefit from having an experienced estate planning lawyer help create your 
succession plan (see Chapter 4).
You Can Transfer Real Property 
Located in Another State
A probate court in one state doesn’t have authority over real estate located 
in another. Thus, when you own real estate in more than one state, probate 
proceedings become more complicated. To settle your estate, your personal 
representative will have to file an ancillary legal action (another probate 

272
Part V: The Part of Tens 
case) in the state and county where the real estate is located. Ancillary 
actions are usually not complicated, but they create expense and delay the 
settlement of your estate.
Once you transfer your real estate holdings into a living trust, your trustee 
can manage your real estate across state lines. You thus avoid having to liti-
gate probate issues in multiple states.
You Have Continuity of Investments
In probate, the assets of your estate may be temporarily frozen, with little 
or no active management of your investments while the probate process is 
completed. Your estate may liquidate your investments and distribute the 
proceeds as cash.
When you place your assets in a trust, your trustee can continuously manage 
your investments pursuant to the terms of the trust.
You Avoid Taxes
Trusts can help you avoid estate taxes. For example:
 
 The bypass trust (or A/B trust) is a common tool used to effectively 
double the estate tax exemption for a married couple.
 
 Charitable trusts can help you reduce your taxable estate while continu-
ing to provide you with income.
 
 Insurance trusts can protect the proceeds of your life insurance from 
estate taxes.
Chapter 12 covers these trusts, as well as a number of others.
Although that list isn’t intended to be comprehensive, you’re probably wondering 
why your living trust is not included. The answer is simple: A basic living trust is 
primarily a tool for probate avoidance and has limited value for tax planning.
You can (and often should) incorporate tax-saving tools into your living trust — 
for example, by creating a bypass trust upon the death of a spouse — but 
you can also create a bypass trust with your will.

Ten Tax Traps to Avoid When 
Planning Your Estate
In This Chapter
 Identifying estate tax traps
 Remembering your priorities when planning your estate
W
hen you plan your estate, you plan how you’re going to give your 
money to your heirs, not to the government. Yet if you have a sub-
stantial estate, failure to plan for taxes can result in a huge estate tax bill.
With planning, you can reduce your estate’s tax liabilities and provide for 
the payment of any estate taxes owed without your heirs having to liquidate 
assets you intended them to inherit.
Not Planning Your Estate
You wouldn’t be reading this book if you weren’t intending to create an 
estate plan. Odds are, you also don’t like the idea of paying lawyers or 
accountants to help you plan your estate. Some people don’t like the idea of 
paying even $1 to a lawyer for help structuring an asset protection plan, even 
if it their estate will save $10 in taxes for every dollar they spend on planning.
I admit that I have sympathy for that position. It can be difficult to take 
money out of your wallet today in order to save taxes in the future, particu-
larly when you won’t even be alive to see the tax bill. You can easily say that 
your heirs are lucky to get anything, and that the estate tax is their problem.
Yet if your estate has to pay taxes, your entire estate plan may fall apart. The 
business you built, now managed by your child, may be encumbered by a sig-
nificant loan necessary to pay estate taxes. The home you left to your child 

274
Part V: The Part of Tens 
may have to be sold to pay the tax bill. Or perhaps the tax bill will be paid 
through the sale of heirlooms you hoped to keep in your family forever.
 
Your best approach is to plan your estate so that your assets are distributed 
in accord with your wishes, while accounting for the possibility of estate tax 
liability and providing for the payment of those taxes.
Focusing Too Much on the Estate Tax
I’m confident that you don’t like the idea that the government may take a bite 
out of the assets you intend to leave to your heirs. I personally accept that 
paying taxes is a civic duty, but I don’t know of anybody who feels a duty to 
pay taxes that can be lawfully avoided.
Nonetheless, the primary purpose of your estate plan is to leave your assets 
to your heirs. Tax planning can help ensure that your heirs receive the inheri-
tances you intend, but too much tax planning can complicate your estate and 
their inheritances.
 
As you move from trying to minimize estate taxes to trying to completely 
avoid them, you may instead end up tying up your assets in a maze of trusts 
and restrictions that frustrate the primary goals of your estate plan.
Doubling the estate tax exemption 
with a bypass trust
An estate planning tool frequently used in larger 
estates is the bypass trust, through which a 
married couple can effectively double their 
exemption from estate taxes. While I highly rec-
ommend that you have a lawyer assist you in 
setting up a bypass trust, the potential cost sav-
ings is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
Your spouse’s inheritance from you is exempt 
from estate taxes, but the full value of your 
spouse’s estate will be subject to estate taxes. 
If you leave all your assets to your spouse, they 
all potentially end up being subject to estate 
taxes.
If you and your spouse use a bypass trust, you 
place an amount, usually the value of the estate 
tax exemption at the time of your death, into a 
trust for the benefit of your children. While 
the trust must restrict your spouse’s power to 
withdraw principal or redirect trust assets, you 
can direct the trust’s income to your spouse. 
But because this money isn’t included in your 
spouse’s estate, your spouse’s estate also ben-
efits from the full estate tax exemption — and 
you’ve effectively doubled the exemption. See 
Chapter 12 for more detail on this trust.

275
 Chapter 20: Ten Tax Traps to Avoid When Planning Your Estate
Assuming that the Estate Tax 
Will Not Change
Ever since the passage of estate tax reform in 2001, the estate tax has been 
in a state of constant evolution. Each year brings new reductions, with the 
estate tax scheduled to be completely eliminated in 2010. And then in 2011, 
due to the budget trickery used to minimize the long-term financial impact 
of the reform, estate taxes revert back to the levels in effect prior to the 2001 
tax cut.
Nobody expects that the reverse will occur. Congress will likely entertain a 
new reform bill that will impose an estate tax, but with much higher exemp-
tions than existed in 2001. Estate tax opponents won’t attempt to block a 
reform bill, as the consequence would be a full reversal of the estate tax.
 
The conventional wisdom is that very large estates should plan for the return 
of an estate tax, and that smaller estates (those held by 95 to 98 percent of all 
Americans) should expect to continue to be exempt from estate taxes. The 
greatest uncertainty is for estates valued between $1.5 million to $4 million, as 
the estate tax exemption is expected to fall somewhere within that range.
You can argue that this speculation is all guesswork, and the estate tax repeal 
will be made permanent. I will agree that even the best educated guesses can 
be wrong, but I will also remind you that nothing is permanent. No matter 
what happens prior to the 2011 estate tax reversion, another round (or 
more!) of estate tax reforms will likely occur during your lifetime.
 
Accept that an estate tax applies to larger estates and plan your estate with 
that in mind. Accept also that you may have to revise your estate in the future 
based upon unexpected changes in the nation’s tax laws.
Trying to Guess How the 
Estate Tax Will Change
You can reasonably assume that the estate tax will change during your life-
time. After all, if you read the preceding section, I just told you that it’s 
going to change. What you should not do is tie yourself up in knots trying to 
guess what the changes will be or try to plan your estate for every possible 
contingency.

276
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
You can’t know the future. Plan your estate to the best of your ability based 
upon what you actually know or what you believe is reasonably certain to 
occur, and don’t worry about the rest. If the law changes significantly during 
your lifetime, you can revise your estate plan.
Not Taking Advantage of Your 
Lifetime Gift Exclusion
At present, you can make lifetime gifts of up to $1 million under your lifetime 
gift tax exclusion. You may make individual gifts of up to $12,000 per year 
without triggering gift taxes. Gifts to your U.S. citizen spouse are not subject 
to gift tax and aren’t counted toward these limits.
 
Your gift is valued at the time it’s given, so the appreciation on your gift 
doesn’t become part of your estate. The gift of stock worth $12,000 today may 
represent a reduction of your taxable estate by $25,000 or more a decade 
later. Two decades later, it may be $50,000 or more. Early gifting can effec-
tively decrease your taxable estate by far more than the nominal $1 million 
lifetime exemption.
While gifts, once given, can’t be taken back, for people with substantial 
estates gifts can be a very important part of the estate planning process.
Not Engaging in Business 
Succession Planning
If you’re a business owner or own a significant share of a business, you may 
be making a comfortable living but not be paying much attention to how 
much the business is worth. When your estate is administered, the IRS will 
take a great deal of interest in the value of your business.
Here’s a possible scenario . Your adult child joins your family business and 
gradually assumes a management role. Eventually, you retire, and your child 
takes over the business, achieving significant growth. You enjoy a healthy 
retirement income, and it never occurs to you to transfer any ownership 
interest to your child. Leaving aside the problems that can result if you have 
other children who will share in the inheritance of the business, the child 

277
 Chapter 20: Ten Tax Traps to Avoid When Planning Your Estate
who manages the business may suddenly have to deal with substantial estate 
tax obligations based upon the valuation of the business at the time of your 
death.
With a transition plan in place, your child (or children) can receive shares 
of the business during your lifetime, and the value of those gifts will be fixed 
as of the time they were given. While they won’t get stepped-up basis in the 
share value at the time of your death, they will still benefit from the lower 
stock valuation at the time they received the gift. The lower value of the 
shares at the time of your gift can potentially save a great deal of estate tax 
and, if your child intends to retain ownership of the business, the potential 
increase in capital gains tax at the time any shares are sold should not be a 
significant concern.
You can also engage in a stock purchase plan, which allows your manager 
child or all your children to buy shares of the business from you, replacing 
income from the business with income from the stock purchase agreement. 
Be sure to take into consideration the capital gains taxes you may owe upon 
selling the shares.
Hiding Property Transfers 
and Gifts from the IRS
You know you’re likely to owe estate taxes, but what if you give your assets 
away to your heirs before you die? You can add them to the deeds of your 
real estate, or make gifts of cash or other valuables in excess of the annual 
gift tax exclusion, and how will the IRS ever know?
The IRS will know, because your personal representative will report the 
gifts when completing the inventory of your estate for the probate court. 
The inventory is submitted under penalty of perjury, and you shouldn’t be 
surprised that the possibility of jail can inspire a great deal of honesty. From 
your lifetime of tax returns, the IRS should have a pretty good idea of the 
assets that should be in your estate, and your executor will realize that lying 
about your history of gifts creates a serious personal risk.
 
You may be thinking about adding your heirs to the title of your property to 
avoid having it pass through your estate. With the exception of joint owner-
ship by your spouse, where the IRS will tax only half the value of the jointly 
held asset, the IRS will presume that the entire value of the jointly held real 
estate is part of your estate.

278
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Having Your Estate Be the Beneficiary 
of Your Life Insurance
Life insurance is generally said to pass outside your estate, meaning that 
life insurance proceeds do not have to pass through probate and don’t have 
to be counted as part of your estate for the calculation of estate taxes. You 
can avoid taxes by transferring ownership of your policy to somebody else, 
and by making sure that your estate isn’t the beneficiary of your policy. (See 
Chapter 16 for a more detailed explanation of how life insurance works.)
If you make your estate the beneficiary of your life insurance, your insurance 
proceeds become part of your estate, and the tax man is happy to take a 
share.
 
Changing beneficiaries is simple. Ask your insurance company for a designa-
tion of beneficiary form, complete and return it, and confirm that it has been 
received and processed by your insurer. But if your estate may have to pay 
estate taxes, designating a beneficiary is only half of the story.
To avoid estate taxes on the proceeds of your life insurance policies, you also 
need to transfer ownership of your policy away from yourself — to another 
person or entity, such as an irrevocable life insurance trust. (Life insurance 
trusts are discussed in Chapter 12). If premiums are due on your policy 
after the transfer, the new owners must pay the premiums. (You can use the 
annual gift tax exclusion to provide the owner with a gift of up to $12,000 per 
Be careful with jointly titled property
You may have a good reason to own your prop-
erty jointly with others, but joint title can create 
unexpected estate tax ramifications. Imagine, 
for example, that your daughter wants to buy 
a house, and you loan her the down payment. 
In order to protect your interest in the property, 
you decide that the home should be jointly titled 
to you and your daughter.
When the IRS learns of the jointly held property, 
it won’t just include the amount of the down 
payment in your estate. Even if your daughter 
has made all the tax, mortgage, and mainte-
nance payments from the day the house was 
purchased, the IRS will seek to include the 
entire value of the joint asset in your estate. 
To avoid having her contribution subjected to 
estate taxes, your daughter must document 
to the IRS her contribution to the value of the 
property, providing evidence as bank records, 
cancelled checks, and other documentation the 
IRS requests.

279
 Chapter 20: Ten Tax Traps to Avoid When Planning Your Estate
year, which they can use to pay the premium.) When you transfer ownership, 
you also give up your ability to directly make changes to the policy, including 
changing beneficiaries. You should obtain written confirmation of the owner-
ship change from your insurance company.
 
If you transfer ownership of your life insurance from your estate within three 
years of your death, you risk having the proceeds included in your estate 
anyway. Gifts of life insurance policies made within three years of your death 
remain subject to federal estate tax.
Not Preparing Your Estate to 
Pay Any Estate Tax Owed
Assume that you have carefully composed an estate plan, and you expect 
that your estate will owe taxes. If your estate doesn’t have cash on hand to 
pay the estate taxes, it may have to sell off the property you intend for your 
heirs in order to pay the tax bill.
 
If your estate holds substantial investment accounts or other savings, its abil-
ity to pay taxes may not be an issue. You may be content to have your invest-
ments liquidated to pay the estate tax. But if you don’t wish for that outcome 
or don’t have that type of liquidity, you may choose to purchase life insurance 
to cover your estate’s tax bill.
You can create a life insurance trust and either transfer an existing life insur-
ance policy to your trust or have your trust purchase a new policy. In order 
to avoid having the trust included in your estate, this trust must be irrevo-
cable, meaning that once you create this trust, you can’t change your mind. 
When a life insurance trust is done correctly, the insurance proceeds will 
not be subject to estate taxes, and your estate can use the money to pay the 
expenses of the estate, including taxes and administrative expenses, out-
standing debts, and funeral costs.
Forgetting That Your Estate 
Will Grow Over Time
If you’re like most people, your estate will continue to grow over the course 
of your life. As you accumulate more assets, this growth tends to accelerate. 

280
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Today, estate tax may look like a distant, unlikely possibility. Twenty or 30 
years from now, your situation may be very different.
Some appreciation in your assets may be almost invisible. Your home or 
vacation property may substantially increase in value. Your business may 
grow, as will your retirement savings. If you forget to transfer your insurance 
policies to third parties or make an ineffective transfer, the insurance money 
is added to the pool. You may be on track to having a much larger estate 
than you had realized.
Periodically review your estate plan and be sure that you include a residuary 
clause directing assets not specifically described in your will to your desired 
heirs. And don’t forget, tax avoidance strategies are best implemented early. 
If you own a business or may pay estate taxes, the sooner you implement 
your gifting strategy, business succession plan, and other tax strategies, the 
more tax you and your heirs are likely to avoid.

his part contains information to help you understand 
state law requirements for executing a valid will, state 
inheritance taxes, and a form to help you compile personal 
and financial information for your estate plan. It also offers 
a list of the forms provided on the accompanying CD.

Appendix A
State Signing Requirements
T
his appendix summarizes the signing requirements for formal wills in all 
50 states and provides an overview of how to properly execute a will. 
Although I strive for accuracy, the laws of some states may have changed 
since the time of publication.
 
When you execute your will, consider your state’s requirements as the mini-
mum you should do. For example:
 
 If your state requires two witnesses, consider using three.
 
 If your state permits you to use a minor as a witness to your will, instead 
use competent adults.
 
 If your state is among those that don’t penalize a witness who is also an 
heir, choose witnesses who will not inherit under your will anyway.
 
 If a self-proving affidavit is optional in your state, execute one anyway.
A self-proving affidavit creates a presumption that the will was properly 
executed and that the signatures on the will are valid. The affidavit simplifies 
admission of your will to the probate court.
Alabama
To execute a valid will in Alabama:
 
 You must sign your will, or your will must be signed in your name by 
some other person in your presence and at your direction.

the signing of your will or witness you acknowledge the signature or 
your will.
Any person generally competent to be a witness may act as a witness to your will. 
No part of your will becomes invalid if will is signed by an interested witness.

Any person aged 18 or older and competent to be a witness may act as a 
witness to your will. Your will isn’t invalidated if signed by an interested wit-
ness, but unless you have at least two other qualified disinterested witnesses

However, unless you have at least two other subscribing witnesses to your 
will who are disinterested, the interested witness is presumed to have pro-
cured your bequest by means of duress, menace, fraud, or undue influence.

lesser of your bequest or the amount the witness would have inherited had 
you died intestate.

Louisiana
Your notarial testament must be prepared in writing and dated. If you know 
how to sign your name and can read and are physically able to do both, then 
your notarial testament must be executed in the following manner:
 
1. In the presence of a notary and two competent witnesses, you must 
declare or signify to them that the instrument is your testament and 
shall sign your name at the end of the testament and on each other sepa-
rate page.
 
2. In the presence of the testator and each other, the notary and the wit-
nesses must sign the following declaration, or one substantially similar: 
“In our presence, the testator has declared or signified that this instru-
ment is his testament and has signed it at the end and on each other 
separate page, and in the presence of the testator and each other we 
have hereunto subscribed our names this ____day of _________, ____.”
Louisiana law also provides for the notarial testament, including, if needed, a

 A person who is literate and sighted, but unable to sign
 
 A person who is unable to read
 
 A person who is legally deaf, or deaf and blind
The formalities prescribed for the execution of a testament must be 
observed, or the testament is absolutely null.
Witness qualifications are as follows:
 
 A person can’t be a witness to any testament if he is insane, blind, under 
the age of 16, or unable to sign his name.
 
 A person who is competent but deaf or unable to read can’t be a witness 
to a notarial testament under Louisiana Civil Code Article 1579.
The fact that a witness or the notary is a beneficiary of the will doesn’t invali-
date the testament. A legacy to a witness or the notary is invalid, but if the 
witness would be an heir in intestacy, the witness may receive the lesser of his 
intestate share (the amount the witness would have inherited had you died 
intestate) or the legacy in the testament. A person may not be a witness to a 
testament if that person is a spouse of a legatee at the time of the execution of 
the testament. The fact that a witness is the spouse of a legatee doesn’t invali-
date the testament; however, a legacy to a witness’ spouse is invalid if the wit-
ness is the spouse of the legatee at the time of the execution of the testament.
Generally, if the legacy is invalidated and if the legatee would be an heir in 
intestacy, the legatee may receive the lesser of his intestate share or legacy

Appendix B
State Inheritance Taxes
In This Appendix
 Looking at federal tax reform
 Wading through estate and inheritance taxes state by state
S
tates have traditionally imposed two forms of taxes on estates:
 
 Estate taxes: Taxes paid by your estate, based upon the total size of 
your estate. Traditionally, every state has imposed an estate tax. For the 
most part, these taxes were covered by a federal estate tax exemption 
and didn’t raise the tax burden on estates.
 
 Inheritance taxes: Taxes based upon the size of your bequest to a par-
ticular heir and your heir’s relationship to you. Only a few states impose 
inheritance taxes.
Your estate may also file federal, state, and local income tax returns for your 
last year of life, and another set of tax returns for income earned by your 
assets during the administration of your estate. Those income taxes aren’t 
affected by estate tax reforms.
This appendix guides you through the taxes you need to pay based on where 
you live. If you want to see the laws of your state in more detail, the Web site 
of CCH Incorporated (www.cch.com) summarizes state estate and inheri-
tance tax laws . Click CCH Websites, CCH Financial Planning Toolkit, and 
then Estate Planning. Then scroll down toward the bottom of the page where 
you’ll find a link to Estate Taxes.
The Impact of Federal Estate Tax Reform
Prior to 2001, the federal estate tax law included a credit for state estate taxes 
paid, up to a specified dollar limit. States were able to tax estates up to the 
amount of the federal limit without raising the overall tax bill of the estate. This 
type of tax is known as a pick-up tax. As of 2001, all states imposed estate taxes 
up to the federal limit, and most imposed no further estate taxes.

308
Part VI: Appendixes 
With the passage of the estate tax reform law in 2001, the federal estate tax credit 
was phased out. As a consequence of that law, states can no longer impose estate 
taxes without increasing the tax burden on estates. Most states chose not to 
impose an additional tax burden, and some repealed their existing estate taxes.
Because most states haven’t changed their laws, if the 2001 estate tax legisla-
tion expires in 2010 and the federal estate tax credit returns, most states will 
immediately start collecting pick-up taxes. A few states have repealed their 
pick-up taxes along with their state estate tax laws, but it is reasonable to 
assume that they will quickly pass legislation to take advantage of any federal 
estate tax credit. Although pickup taxes don’t increase your estate’s total tax 
bill, your personal representative will have to prepare and submit an addi-
tional tax return.
States That Don’t Tax Estates
The following states do not presently impose either inheritance or estate taxes:
Alabama 
Alaska 
Arizona 
Arkansas 
California
Colorado 
Delaware 
Florida 
Georgia 
Hawaii
Idaho 
Michigan 
Mississippi 
Missouri 
Montana
Nevada 
New Hampshire New Mexico North Dakota South Carolina
South Dakota Texas 
Utah 
Virginia 
West Virginia
Wisconsin 
Wyoming
 
Most of these states have dormant pick-up taxes that will come back into 
effect if the 2001 estate tax legislation expires in 2010. (For more information, 
see the preceding section.)
States That Impose Only 
Inheritance Taxes
The following states impose inheritance taxes, but do not impose estate taxes:
Indiana 
Iowa 
Kentucky 
Louisiana
Nebraska 
Pennsylvania 
Tennessee
Most states either exempt close relatives from inheritance taxes or offer dif-
ferent tax rates and exemption levels based upon how closely related your 
heir is to you.

309
 Appendix B: State Inheritance Taxes
States That Impose Only Estate Taxes
The following states impose estate taxes, but do not impose inheritance 
taxes. The threshold for estate taxation is provided for each state. (Estates 
valued at or above the described threshold are subject to estate tax.)
 
 Connecticut: $2 million
 
 Illinois: $2 million
 
 Kansas: $1 million
 
 Maine: $1 million
 
 Massachusetts: $1 million
 
 Minnesota: $1 million
 
 New York: $1 million
 
 North Carolina: $2 million
 
 Ohio: $338,333
 
 Oklahoma: $1 million
 
 Oregon: $1 million
 
 Rhode Island: $675,000
 
 Vermont: $2 million
 
 Washington: $2 million
If the federal estate tax repeal becomes permanent, estate tax laws of Illinois 
and Vermont are scheduled to expire in 2010. Kansas and Oklahoma have 
passed legislation repealing their estate taxes as of January 1, 2010.
States That Impose Both Estate and 
Inheritance Taxes
Two states impose both estate taxes and inheritance taxes:
 
 Maryland: Estate tax threshold, $1 million
 
 New Jersey: Estate tax threshold, $675,000

Troubleshooting
I tried my best to compile forms and worksheets that work on most comput-
ers with the minimum system requirements. Alas, your computer may differ, 
and some may not work properly for some reason.
The two likeliest problems are that you don’t have enough memory (RAM) 
for the programs you want to use, or you have other programs running that 
are affecting installation or running of a program. If you get an error message 
such as Not enough memory or Setup cannot continue, try one or 
more of the following suggestions and then try using the software again:
 
 Turn off any antivirus software running on your computer. Installation 
programs sometimes mimic virus activity and may make your computer 
incorrectly believe that it’s being infected by a virus.
 
 Close all running programs. The more programs you have running, the 
less memory is available to other programs. Installation programs typi-
cally update files and programs; so if you keep other programs running, 
installation may not work properly.
 
 Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer. This 
step is, admittedly, drastic and somewhat expensive. However, adding 
more memory can really help the speed of your computer and allow 
more programs to run at the same time.
Customer Care
If you have trouble with the CD-ROM, please call the Wiley Product Technical
