Foreword
The issues addressed in this work complement the basic biochemistry curriculum.
The authors assume that the reader is already familiar with the material covered in
a classic biochemistry course. An integrative approach—which is attempted here—
enables the reader to grasp the entirety of the problem domain.
We believe that the proposed systemic approach to biology will prove useful not
only for students but also for teaching staff and for all those interested in the general
domain of biology.
Our handbook frequently refers to real-world macroscopic models. The purpose
of this exercise is to underline the unity of the laws of physics, chemistry and biology
and, at the same time, the clear and obvious nature of certain solutions derived from
biochemistry and the macroscopic world.
We believe that high school students, already in possession of a large body of
detailed information, should focus on generalizations rather than on encyclopedic
knowledge, which necessarily becomes fragmented and selective as the amount of
available data increases. In our view the foremost goal of education is to ensure
that knowledge can be put to practical use by associating facts and predicting their
consequences. This can only be achieved by acquainting students with the rules and
mechanisms governing various processes and phenomena. Our work should therefore
be viewed in light of the presented goal.
Approaching the subject of biology from the viewpoint of basic scientiﬁc
knowledge (physics and chemistry) yields a convenient platform to formulate gener-
alizations. This is why we have divided the subject matter of the handbook into ﬁve
sections: the structure and function of living organisms, the role of energy in biol-
ogy, the role of information in living organisms, regulatory processes in biological
systems and the modes of cooperation in such systems.
We believe that these generalizations will provide readers—particularly those
interested in expanding their knowledge beyond simple academic minima—with
exploitable insight in the ﬁeld of biochemistry. Generations introduced is aimed also
to become the platform for using simulation techniques.
It goes without saying that any attempt at generalizing diverse biological phenom-
ena involves the risk of oversimpliﬁcations or overstepping the bounds of science.
Such threats also apply to our work and the reader should be fully aware of this fact.

Foreword
As stated above, this study is primarily aimed at students and therefore it assumes
the form of a handbook. In order to encourage readers to try their own hand at in-
terpreting observable events the last section of the book contains some unresolved
hypotheses dealing with fundamental biological processes and the phenomenon of
life itself. These include key problems in medicine and drug research, e.g. protein
folding and proteome construction, as well as the challenge of formulating a proper
deﬁnition of life. We hope that the presented study will encourage readers to try and
develop their own approaches to such problems.
The work is supplemented by references, including other handbooks, selected
monographs and periodicals dealing with the basic problems of biochemistry.

Introduction
If we are to assume that biology is not subject to its special, unique laws, but rather
conforms to the established principles of physics and chemistry, it follows that the
biological world consists of self-managing and self-organizing systems which owe
their existence to a steady supply of energy and information.
Thermodynamics introduces a distinction between open and closed systems. Re-
versibleprocessesoccurringinclosedsystems(i.e. independentoftheirenvironment)
automatically gravitate toward a state of equilibrium which is reached once the ve-
locity of a given reaction in both directions becomes equal. When this balance is
achieved, we can say that the reaction has effectively ceased. In a living cell, a
similar condition occurs upon death.
Life relies on certain spontaneous processes acting to unbalance the equilibrium.
Such processes can only take place when substrates and products of reactions are
traded with the environment, i.e. they are only possible in open systems. In turn,
achieving a stable level of activity in an open system calls for regulatory mechanisms.
When the reaction consumes or produces resources that are exchanged with the
outside world at an uneven rate, the stability criterion can only be satisﬁed via a
negative feedback loop (Fig. 1).
As cells and living organisms are thermodynamically open systems (namely, they
correspond to the description presented above), their internal processes must be
subject to automatic regulation if balance is to be maintained. Thus, all structures
which play a role in balanced biological activity may be treated as components of a
feedback loop. This observation enables us to link and integrate seemingly unrelated
biological processes.
In light of the above, the biological structures most directly involved in the func-
tions and mechanisms of life can be divided into receptors, effectors, information
conduits and elements subject to regulation (reaction products and action results).
Exchanging these elements with the environment requires an inﬂow of energy. Thus,
living cells are—by their nature—open systems, requiring an energy source, i.e.
a highly exergonic process. They must also possess the ability to exploit their net
energy gains and access stores of information, particularly genetic information.
A thermodynamically open system lacking equilibrium due to a steady inﬂow of
energy in the presence of automatic regulation is therefore a good theoretical model

signs of life exhibited by a cell reﬂect its automatic regulatory processes (Fig. 2.)

that it is, in fact, alive. The additional potential for division and differentiation enables
cells to participate in an organized system which is colloquially termed nature.

Introduction
ix
Pursuing growth and adapting to changing environmental conditions calls for
specialization which comes at the expense of reduced universality. A specialized cell
is no longer self-sufﬁcient. As a consequence, a need for higher forms of intercellular
organization emerges. The structure which provides cells with suitable protection and
ensures continued homeostasis is called an organism.
In order to explain why organisms exist and how they relate to cells, we can draw
analogies between biology and the state-citizen model. Both systems introduce a
hierarchy of needs which subordinates the latter to the former. In a biological system
subordination applies to cells, while in a state it affects individuals.
Similarly to cells, organisms are subject to automatic regulation. Reaching a
higher level of complexity does not imply abandoning automatic regulative pro-
cesses in favor of a different means of organization, although signals which reach
individual cells are—for obvious reasons—inherently coercive, forcing the cell to
surrender its independence for the beneﬁt of the organism. This relation is vital for
both the organism and the cell, and therefore underpins the evolution of all biological
structures.

Chapter 1
The Structure and Function of Living Organisms
In biology, structure dictates function.
Abstract The systemic approach adopted in this work focuses on generic biological
phenomena. The goal is to explain the strategies employed by biological systems
by invoking fundamental concepts in physics, chemistry and information theory.
Structure and function is the ﬁrst of ﬁve chapters which make up the book.
In biology, structure and function are tightly interwoven. This phenomenon is
closely associated with the principles of evolution. Evolutionary development has
produced structures which enable organisms to develop and maintain its architec-
ture, perform actions and store the resources needed to survive. For this reason we
introduce a distinction between support structures (which are akin to construction
materials), function-related structures (fulﬁlling the role of tools and machines), and
storage structures (needed to store important substances, achieving a compromise
between tight packing and ease of access).
Arguably the most important property of biological structures is their capacity
for self-organization. Ongoing evolution has led to the emergence of biological
constructs capable of exploiting basic physico-chemical interactions in support of
directed organization processes, limiting in this way the quantity of the encoded
information needed to perform their function. Examples of self-organization in-
clude the spontaneous folding in water of polypeptide chains and creation of cellular
membranes.
Keywords Self-organization · Support structures · Function-related structures ·
Storage structures
The reliance of nature on self-regulation and self-organization implies a certain
speciﬁcity in interactions. At the same time, evolutionary pressure acts to elimi-
nate burdensome and disadvantageous structures. Tight coupling between structure
and function is therefore ubiquitous in biology. Analysis of the available information
points to strategies for creation and exploitation of structures which facilitate certain
processes in living organisms.

Small-Molecule Structures and Polymers
Biology makes extensive use of small-molecule structures and polymers. The phys-
ical properties of polymer chains make them a key building block in biological
structures. There are several reasons as to why polymers are indispensable in nature:
A. Polymers enable multipoint surface contact, which strengthens reactions and
yields strong complexes held together with noncovalent bonds. The structure of a
polymer makes noncovalent bonding (which is far more common than its covalent
counterpart) a meaningful mode of interaction, sufﬁcient to stabilize compounds
which could not otherwise be constructed from monomers.
Figure 1.1 Depicts the interaction of monomeric units and polymers in a model
system.
B. They enable the use of globular polymer structures as carriers of atypical envi-
ronmental conditions, particularly apolar microenvironments, isolated from water by
a polymer layer. This phenomenon gives rise to active protein compounds, which—
owing to the apolar nature of their environment—catalyze many reactions otherwise
unattainable in water (Fig. 1.2).

Data Bank)
C. The multifocality of interactions involving polymers provides for the emer-
gence of structures unique in terms of their surface shape and orientation (Fig. 1.3).
In this way polymers can be used to encode information.
D. Creation of complexes using noncovalent bonds enables reversible and
controllable reactions which are fundamentally important in biological systems.
1.1.2
The Biological Purpose of Cellular and Organism
Structures
In general terms, biological structures can be divided into three groups, each serving
a different purpose:

and C storage tasks
1. Supporting structures, not directly involved in processes which constitute life,
but providing a framework and foundation for such processes. These structures
perform shielding, reinforcing and dividing functions, which roughly equate to
the role of architecture in our macroscopic world.
2. Structures directly involved in the functioning of living organisms, i.e. those
that facilitate metabolism and motion. If we accept the proposition that biologi-
cal functions are inseparably tied to regulatory processes and that all functional
structures belong to regulatory loops, these structures can be further subdivided
into receptors, effectors and information conduits.
3. Storage structures, i.e. structures used to store information and energy. Their
goal is to ﬁt as much energy (or information) into as small a volume as possible,
as well as to enable rapid access to both.
The presented classiﬁcation acknowledges the divergence of structural elements
which form living organisms. The properties of structures belonging to each group
are a clear consequence of their evolutionary goals. Similar models exist in many
non-biological systems where individual objects interact to perform a common
task. An example of such a system is depicted in Fig. 1.4.
It can be noted that the challenges that need to be overcome when e.g. erecting
buildings (such as factories) are substantially different from those involving machines
and tools. Furthermore, any production process (and particularly one that is subject to
ﬂuctuations in the supply of raw resources and demand for ﬁnished goods) must take
into account storage capabilities: the shape of manufactured goods should enable
efﬁcient storage and easy access.

Figure 1.5 summarizes the properties of the presented structures and the reasons
behind introducing this classiﬁcation.
1.1.3
Supporting Structures
The purpose of these structures is to provide shielding and support, and also—owing
to their physical properties—ensure sufﬁcient rigidity and elasticity of biological
entities. Supporting elements are, by their nature, one- or two-dimensional: they
include ﬁbers, membranes and walls.
As conditions and processes which take place inside a cell differ signiﬁcantly from
those encountered outside, supporting structures must be suitably differentiated to
suit both. Thus, each cell and each organism makes use of many different types of
supporting structures.
1.1.3.1
Cellular Supporting Structures
Cells owe their existence to ﬁbers forming the so-called cytoskeletons. The cytoskele-
ton can best be described as an aggregation of structures which provide the cell with
rigidity while also ensuring certain elasticity, similar to the scaffold of a tent. How-
ever, unlike a manmade scaffold, the cytoskeleton must allow for changes associated
with the biological function of the cell (relative motion of cellular organelles; motion
of the entire cell). Motion is sustained by maintaining a dynamic balance between
formation and decomposition of ﬁbers. In addition to directed motion, the supporting
structure must also enable expansion and contraction of the cell.
As explained above, motion is facilitated by ﬁbrillar structures which consist of
globular subcomponents, attached and detached to one another in a steady process of
synthesis and decomposition. Typical ﬁbrillar structures which fulﬁll these criteria
include microtubules and microﬁlaments (Fig. 1.6).
Microtubules are pipelike structures (Fig. 1.6A) characterized by signiﬁcant rigid-
ity and ability to withstand mechanical forces. In terms of their structural properties,
they can best be compared to a factory smokestack (Fig. 1.6-right).
The chainlike microﬁlaments (Fig. 1.6B) also consist of globular units. Their
elasticity is far greater than that of microtubules. In a way, they resemble ropes,
although their tensile strength is not as great (a consequence of the fact that, just like
microtubules, they are also composed of globular units).
In contrast, structures formed from ﬁbrillar compounds are far stronger and
capable of resisting signiﬁcant longitudinal forces. The most distinctive cellular sup-
porting structure is the so-called intermediate ﬁlament—another type of ﬁber which
contributes to the scaffolding of a cell. Intermediate ﬁlaments differ signiﬁcantly
from the structures mentioned above. Their monomeric elements are ﬁbrillar, unlike
microtubules and microﬁlaments which consist of globular units (Fig. 1.6C). They
assume the form of parallel dimers (Fig. 1.6C–a) forming a structure which can be

compared to roof tiling (Fig. 1.6C–b). Together, these units constitute the ﬁnal form
of the intermediate ﬁlament (Fig 1.6C–c). Intermediate ﬁlaments resemble ropes
with respect to their physical properties (Fig. 1.6-right).
Unlike microtubules and microﬁlaments, intermediate ﬁlaments are apolar. Their
dimers are bound in a counter-parallel fashion, such that their terminal carboxyl and
amine domains enter a 1:1 relation with one another. Moreover, it seems that inter-
mediate ﬁlaments are not autonomous in determining their direction of expansion
within a cell and that they are assisted in this respect by microtubules. Research sug-
gests that intermediate ﬁlaments do not degrade in the same way as microtubules:
instead of yielding a substrate which can be further used to construct supramolec-
ular structures, they are instead digested and broken down into fragments. Owing
to these properties intermediate ﬁlaments are more closely related to extracellular
supporting structures. They are not restricted to acting within the boundaries of a
cell; instead, they may permeate the cellular membrane (at points where desmosomes
are located) and attach themselves to the cytoskeletons of neighboring cells. They
stabilize multicellular complexes in epithelial tissues and organs .
Elongation of intermediate ﬁlaments is made possible by speciﬁc interactions
of globular fragments positioned at the ends of monomeric ﬁbrils (Fig. 1.6C). In
addition to elongation, the ﬁlaments are also capable of growing in thickness. The
ﬁbreous nature of their monomeric components grants them physical resilience and

of autonomous direction and low renewal rate make them the most static component
of the cellular cytoskeleton.
Intermediate ﬁlaments are nonuniform in nature, though they all share a similar
basic structure. Their lack of uniformity is a result of speciﬁc adaptation to the
requirements of various types of cells.

and guy ropes), which together ensure proper shape of the ﬁnished structure. On the right—Painting
of a drawbridge by Vincent van Gogh
As structures, microﬁlaments and microtubules are not strictly limited to facili-
tating motion: their rigidity and elasticity enables them to play an important role in
reinforcing the structure of the cell.
It appears that microﬁlaments concentrated near the boundaries of the cell are re-
sponsible for maintaining proper tension of its membrane while microtubules provide
the cell with appropriate rigidity (Fig. 1.7).
Observing the dynamic changes in the length of microﬁlaments and microtubules
as well as the motion patterns effected by interaction with motor proteins enables
us to classify such cytoskeletal structures as functional in nature. This association
of supporting structures with motion is quite peculiar and unlike most manmade
objects. In search for suitable macroscopic equivalents we can refer to escalators,
rotating stages and drawbridges, which—depending on the situation—may serve as
barriers or roads (Fig. 1.7-right).
1.1.3.2
Cellular Shielding Structures
The second class of cellular supporting structures comprises shielding structures—
speciﬁcally, cellular membranes (consisting of phospholipids) and extracellular
membranes (e.g. the basal membrane, composed of ﬁbrillar protein and glycoprotein
aggregates). Phospholipid cellular membranes also include glycolipids, cholesterol
and various proteins. While all integrated proteins contribute to the stability of their
membranes, only some of them (such as spectrin) are clearly supportive in nature,
serving as a scaffold for the membrane itself.
The cohesiveness and rigidity of membranes are important in determining their
function. Phospholipid solutions act as liquid crystals: in water they form a planar
(non-spherical) micelle capable of performing the functions of a membrane. Such
interlocking panel-like arrangement is made possible by minimizing repulsive forces

of double bonds and cis- and trans- isomers on the area of adhesion and range of potential molecular
interactions in the lipid layer of a cellular membrane
through mutual cancellation of positive (choline) and negative (phosphoric acid)
charges in the polar fragments of phospholipid molecules. (Fig. 1.8).
The lyotropic, liquid crystal properties of membranes enables them to retain some
characteristics of a liquid. At normal body temperatures, cellular membranes have
the approximate thickness of tar. The elasticity of the membrane can be increased or
decreased without affecting ambient temperature, by altering the ratio of saturated
and unsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 1.8).
The presence of a double bond and the resulting divergence of cis- and trans-
conﬁgurations reduces adhesion and inhibits molecule interactions, thus lowering
the overall rigidity of the system. On the other hand, the increased adhesion of
saturated molecules results in increased rigidity, more closely resembling that of a
solid. An identical phenomenon occurs in margarine production where the viscosity
of vegetable oils is increased via reduction reactions.
Another important mechanism which contributes to the rigidity of cellular
membranes is cholesterol intercalation.
Cellular membranes (both cytoplasmic and nuclear) may be further stabilized by a
two-dimensional lattice consisting of ﬁbrillar proteins parallel to the membrane. Such
a scaffold is formed e.g. by spectrin molecules in the membranes of erythrocytes and

other types of cells. Spectrin is a protein-based ﬁbrillar complex made up of a coiled
pair of giant polypeptide chains designated α and β. Both chains consist of periodic
sequences of repeating protein domains, each in the shape of a helix, separated by
hinge fragments. Together with microﬁbrils, they create a lattice attached to the
underside of the membrane. This structure is particularly important in erythrocytes
which lack the skeleton present in eukaryotic cells and therefore require special
membrane stabilization mechanisms.
1.1.3.3
Extracellular Supporting Structures
Similarly to intermediate ﬁlaments, protein microﬁlaments present in extracellular
supporting structures are not directly involved in motion; thus they may be ﬁbrillar,
with relatively limited exchange dynamics. Examples of such structures include col-
lagen and elastin. Just like in intermediate ﬁlaments, their ﬁbrillar nature is primarily
due to the lack of variability in their aminoacid composition (repeating GLY-PRO-X
sequences in collagen and PRO-GLY-VAL-GLY in elastin).
Contrary to amino acids sequences which give rise to ﬁbrillar structures, the
globular nature of functional proteins is determined by high variability of aminoacid
chains, in particular the uneven distribution of hydrophobic residues.
The abundance of proline and glycine in collagen chains determines their struc-
ture (although it should be noted that collagen owes its ﬁbrillar nature chieﬂy to
the repeatability of aminoacid sequences). High numbers of proline and glycine
units impose speciﬁc torsion on the resulting spiral, while their relatively small vol-
umes (particularly in the case of glycine) provide the resulting strands with high
cohesiveness which translates into increased rigidity.
Elastin is a special protein responsible for the elasticity of tissues. The very
notion of elasticity is somewhat unusual as the material in question must be capable
of ﬂuid noncooperative transition from a folded to a stretched state, yet retain the
tendency to return to the initial folded state (much like rubber). Such properties are
not found in secondary and tertiary structures of polypeptide chains, which—being
cooperative—tend to unfold in an abrupt manner, kinetically equivalent to the phase
transition observed in denaturation (Fig. 1.9).

Fig. 1.10 A hypothetical model explaining the elasticity and noncooperative melting of elastin. The
diagram in the top right-hand corner presents the symbol and structure of desmosine. Darkened
areas indicate potential hydrogen bonding sites
The elasticity of elastin results from shearing hydrogen bonds. In this respect, it
may be compared to mechanically-induced melting. The ﬂuid nature of this process
proves that the structure of elastin peptide chains is highly random (Fig. 1.10).
Owing to the rotational freedom of glycine in polypeptide chains and the fact that
glycine constitutes 50 % of elastin, the resulting protein may assume a practically
unlimited number of folding conﬁgurations. The force which induces folding is most
likelyassociatedwithhydrogenbondsstabilizingtheso-called β-turns, whereverpro-
line and glycine are directly adjacent. In addition, the hydrophobic nature of elastin
(a consequence of valine abundance) protects hydrogen bonds from coming into
contact with water, thus facilitating smooth refolding with many intermediate states
and high structural randomness. Covalent binding of peptide chains with desmosine
bridges ensures continuity of the resulting material, enabling it to assume one-, two-

hydrogen bonds which link

and even three-dimensional shapes. This type of structure is functionally equivalent
to a spring mattress, whose individual components are composed of elastic elements
yet bound together in a stable conﬁguration (Fig. 1.9).
The polypeptide chains of collagen are mostly polar and therefore unable to fold
in a random fashion. Here, water-isolated hydrogen bonds can exist only between
separate chains; hence collagen stabilizes in the form of tightly fused triple-chain
conglomerates (Fig. 1.11). The tight fusing of collagen ﬁbrils, made possible by
their high glycine content, increases their rigidity and enables them to mechanically
stabilize connective tissue.
Keratins are another family of ﬁbrillar proteins, distinguished by their purpose
and function. They act as intermediate ﬁlaments and are essentially intracellular in
nature, although they may occasionally traverse cellular boundaries. Synthesized
inside living cells, they persist through cell death, forming a solid, insoluble mass,
expressed e.g. as ﬁngernails and hair.

of β-type polysaccharide chains facilitates easy inter-chain contact and ensures good mechanical
resilience of the resulting complexes
Keratins include repeating seven amino acids sequences (a property common in
intermediate ﬁlaments). This repeatability determines their ﬁbrillar nature, while low
polarity and high numbers of disulﬁde bonds linking individual chains contribute to
the mechanical resilience of structures composed of keratin ﬁbers.
1.1.3.4
Polysaccharides as Supporting Structures
A special class of supporting structures consists of polysaccharides. These substances
are characterized by high rigidity, which is due to the stabilizing inﬂuence of β-
glycosidic bonds (Fig. 1.12).
Contrary to storage sugars, i.e. α-type polysaccharides which exhibit the tendency
to form helical structures, the presence of β-glycosidic bonds results in threadlike
strands which interact with one another in a highly speciﬁc fashion. Good contact
between individual ﬁbrils, particularly the high number of point-to-point interactions
observed in β-type polysaccharide chains, makes the resulting complexes highly re-
sistant to mechanical damage and thus useful in supporting structures. The relatively
low diversity of monomeric units observed in carbohydrate polymers (compared to
proteins) results in similarly low diversity among their derivative structures.
It should be noted that the general diversity of proteins is a direct consequence of
the enormous variability in both the number and ordering (sequence) of aminoacids,
giving rise to a wide array of function-speciﬁc structures. By the same token, polysac-
charides consisting of a single type of monomer cannot adapt to diverse functions
and are therefore better suited to providing structural support.

The Structure and Function of Living Organisms
Fig. 1.13 Fragments of polysaccharides with differing levels of polarity: A chitin, B cellulose, C
hyaluronate, D keratan sulfate, E chondroitin sulfate, F heparin
Cellulose is a conglomerate of long fibrils, each comprising hundreds of glucose
molecules. The most frequently observed unit of cellulose is a packet consisting
of approximately 60–80 fused threadlike polymer strands. Further packing yields a
clustered, uniform mass.
Polysaccharide frameworks are ubiquitous in the realm of plants and among prim-
itive animals such as insects. In the latter group, the most frequently occurring
polysaccharide is chitin—an interesting example of how nature reinforces polymer
structures by increasing the number of inter-chain interactions. In the case of chitin,
this function is performed by amide groups, which easily form hydrogen bonds and
therefore increase the overall tensile strength of the framework. On the other hand,
rigidity can also be reduced via uniform polarization of individual monomers com-
prising the polymer chain, which increases their electrostatic repulsion and lowers
the tensile strength of the resulting material (Fig. 1.13).
Polar polysaccharides, such as keratan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate, are encoun-
tered in tissues as chains. Together with speciﬁc proteins and (optionally) hyaluronic
acid, they can form giant, branching, treelike structures which play an important role
in binding water molecules. Their interaction with collagen fibers (with which they
form complexes) gives connective tissue the required rigidity and turgor as a filler
(Fig. 1.14).

tein chains, C bound water molecules (shaded areas)
Glycosaminoglycans are a good example of how polar polysaccharides can be
employed in connective tissue (Fig. 1.14).
In summary, we can state that—contrary to the cellular cytoskeleton—extracel-
lular polymer structures (both protein- and carbohydrate-based) play a mostly passive
and supportive role in living organisms.
1.1.4
Structures Associated with Biological Functions
The term „functional structures” denotes structures which facilitate metabolism and
motion (respectively—changes in the properties of matter and changes in location).
Reversible creation of speciﬁc complexes enables biological functions.
The seemingly endless diversity of biological functions frustrates all but the most
persistent attempts at classiﬁcation. For the purpose of this handbook we assume that
each function can be associated either with a single cell or with a living organism.
In both cases, biological functions are strictly subordinate to automatic regulation,
based—in a stable state—on negative feedback loops, and in processes associated
with change (for instance in embryonic development)—on automatic execution of
predetermined biological programs. Individual components of a cell cannot perform
regulatory functions on their own (just like a thermometer or heat pump extracted
from a refrigerator). Thus, each element involved in the biological activity of a cell
or organism must necessarily participate in a regulatory loop based on processing
information.

16
1
The Structure and Function of Living Organisms
In light of this assumption, we can divide all functional structures into the
following categories:
1. receptor structures,
2. effector structures,
3. information carriers,
4. structures which are subject to regulation (regulated process components).
The detector function of a receptor and the action of an effector may be facilitated by
simple proteins or by complexes consisting of many protein molecules. Proteins are
among the most basic active biological structures. Most of the well-known proteins
studied thus far perform effector functions: this group includes enzymes, transport
proteins, certain immune system components (complement factors) and myoﬁbrils.
Their purpose is to maintain biological systems in a steady state. Our knowledge
of receptor structures is somewhat poorer, mostly due to their tight integration with
cellular membranes, making them difﬁcult to extract and isolate in a crystalline form.
Involvement in a given function may be either active or passive. Active involve-
ment occurs in proteins and certain forms of RNA. The term “active form” typically
denotes the form genetically programmed to create a speciﬁc complex and ful-
ﬁll a speciﬁc biological purpose. This form is also responsible for ensuring that
the resulting complex is well suited to its function and that it undergoes structural
changes while performing that function. Biological functions are usually mediated by
proteins. On the other hand, passive involvement in biological mechanisms is char-
acteristic of reaction substrates and products, as well as various messenger molecules
such as hormones and DNA.
Contrary to supporting structures, the proteins which participate in functional
aspects of life are almost invariably globular.
Receptor and effector structures may be either simple or complex. The need for
complex receptors emerges when signals become unclear and difﬁcult to classify. A
similar process occurs in effectors, where certain tasks require advanced and well-
organizedsystems. Forinstance, mostenzymaticeffectorscanbedividedintodistinct
stages (catalysis of complex reactions often involves many separate steps). Such
multienzyme effectors assist e.g. in glycolysis, synthesis of purines and pyrimidines
as well as synthesis and degradation of fatty acids.
Simple structures, including individual enzymes and components of multienzyme
systems, can be treated as “tools” available to the cell, while advanced systems,
consisting of many mechanically-linked tools, resemble machines. The rationale
behind constructing machines is obvious: certain processes cannot take place without
the aid of complex mechanical devices. Combined action of tools enables efﬁcient
processing of materials while reducing the need for immediate access to information.
In a machine model, individual elements (tools) perform work under the supervision
of integrating mechanisms (Fig. 1.15) such as conveyor belts, chains, gears etc. In a
cell the role of conveyor belts is fulﬁlled by special protein structures acting as booms
or servos. Other, more advanced structures, can be distinguished as well, facilitating
the conversion of energy into structural changes. Simple boom mechanisms are often
thermally powered, i.e. their action is determined by the laws of Brownian motion.

Machinelike mechanisms are readily encountered in living cells. A classic exam-
ple is fatty acid synthesis, performed by dedicated machines called synthases. The
process is similar to β-oxidation, however synthesizing a fatty acid molecule carries
a net increase in the structural ordering of the product. This property implies the
need for energy as well as a source of information which is implicitly contained in
the structure of synthase, enabling its enzymes to collaborate on a common task. In
contrast, enzymes charged with degradation of fatty acids require no such informa-
tion and do not need to form machines as their ﬁnal product is more chaotic than the
substrate they break down.
Fatty acid synthase is a homodimer consisting of two identical (260-kd) subunits
which perform enzymatic actions related to the synthesis of palmitate. Both struc-
tures are cross-linked with loose hinge fragments, enabling relatively unrestricted
motion—an important property required for good contact between the enzyme and
the chain undergoing synthesis. Owing to the apolarity of the substrate, synthesis
occurs in dedicated hydrophobic gaps in which the active moieties are concentrated.
The boomlike structure which aligns the substrate with active sites of the complex
is called ACP (acyl carrier protein). It includes a long, ﬂexible chain, structurally
similar to coenzyme A. High ﬂexibility of the whole complex, and particularly of
ACP, creates suitable conditions for alignment of the substrate with moieties re-
quired at each stage of the synthesis process. Both halves of the machine come into
play at certain stages while their crosslinked nature is primarily a stabilizing factor
(Fig. 1.16).
Another example of a biological machine is the pyruvate carboxylase enzyme
which consists of two enzymatic domains (biotin carboxylase domain and carboxyl
transferase domain) in addition to a biotin binding domain (Fig. 1.17). Multiunit
structures acting as machines can be encountered wherever complex biochemical
processes need to be performed in an efﬁcient manner.

Individual machine parts are

action from high-energy bonds. A good example is the ribosome which acts as a
shifting matrix for the synthesis of polypeptide chains.
If the purpose of a machine is to generate motion then a thermally powered
machine can accurately be called a motor. This type of action is observed e.g. in
myocytes, where transmission involves reordering of protein structures using the
energy generated by hydrolysis of high-energy bonds.
Some production tasks are performed by entire “factory chains”, i.e. structures
integrated in cellular membranes in an ordered fashion. This mode of operation is
applied in synthesis and distribution of certain proteins (Fig. 1.18). The nucleus of
the cell, acting as a “design department”, issues blueprints via the “conveyor belt”
structure of endoplasmic reticulum. The resulting products enter the Golgi appara-
tus while undergoing stepwise changes. Inside the apparatus they are “packaged”
and cleared for “export” (i.e. expression outside the cell). The “wrapping paper” is
actually a special protein called clathrine, whose associations assume the form of
vesicles, encapsulating the synthesized “payload” proteins.
In biology, function is generally understood as speciﬁc physiochemical action,
almost universally mediated by proteins. Most such actions are reversible which
meansthatasingleproteinmoleculemayperformitsfunctionmanytimes. Functional
proteins are usually globular in shape and contain similar types of active sites—
pockets or clefts characterized by concentration of exposed hydrophobic residues
and appropriate (for a given substrate) arrangement of polar aminoacid groups or
no-protein-based structures, enabling the site to attach to speciﬁc types of ligands.
In addition, enzymatic active sites include a catalytic element (Fig. 1.19A).
This element is directly responsible for catalysis, i.e. for action which affects a
speciﬁc bond in the substrate and converts it to an intermediate state where it can

spontaneously reassemble into the ﬁnal product. Catalysis can be performed by a
special aminoacid group, a metal ion or a coenzyme (Fig. 1.19B).
The intermediate state is an unstable form of the substrate, highly susceptible to
environmental stimuli. This instability typically hinges on a single molecular bond.
Substrates can enter intermediate states as a result of mechanical stress resulting
from local incompatibilities between a tightly bound substrate molecule and the
active moiety of the enzyme. A good example is lysozyme whose active moiety
strongly binds to polysaccharide fragments consisting of 6 monomers, one of which
is sterically unaligned. The resulting change in the structure of the substrate deprives
the glycosidic bond of its stability and eventually leads to hydrolysis.
In general terms, we can state that enzymes accelerate reactions by lowering acti-
vation energies for processes which would otherwise occur very slowly or not at all.
Hydrophobic component is required for the formation of stable ligand complexes
in aqueous environments, irrespective of structural considerations. This is due to the
fact that electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds are strongly selected against in
physiological saline solutions, as water itself is a good donor and acceptor of protons
while salt ions act as shields. Thus, saline environments limit surface interactions and
prevent native proteins from aggregating even at high concentrations (for instance in
blood plasma or egg white). Since spontaneous noncovalent surface interactions are
very infrequent, the shape and structure of active sites—with high concentrations
of hydrophobic residues—makes them the preferred area of interaction between
functional proteins and their ligands. They alone provide the appropriate conditions
for the formation of hydrogen bonds; moreover, their structure may determine the
speciﬁc nature of interaction. The functional bond between a protein and a ligand
is usually noncovalent and therefore reversible. Covalent bonds formed in certain
catalytic processes are usually short-lived and do not contribute to the stability of
the product). In addition to providing a suitable area for reactions, hydrophobic

visible on a dark background A but becomes hard to discern when the background is well lit B
environments also play an important role in determining the orientation of substrates.
Any polar moiety in a predominantly hydrophobic area (i.e. the active site) stands
out like a beacon and may determine the alignment of the substrate (Fig. 1.20).
Chemical afﬁnity of complexes may be expressed in terms of their dissociation
constant K, where k1 and k2 indicate the rate of formation and degradation of the
complex:
K = k2/k1
The dissociation constant determines the state of equilibrium in antibodies, receptors,
transport proteins and other protein-ligand complexes. For enzymes, the equation is
supplemented by a third variable indicating the rate at which the complex converts
into its ﬁnal product (k3):
K = (k2 + k3)/k1
In enzymatic reactions K is also called the Michaelis-Menten constant (KM) in honor
of Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten who discovered the relation between reaction
rate v and substrate concentration S, showing that the equation
v = VMAX ∗[S]

(KM + [S])
determines the so-called saturation curve and that further concentration of the sub-
strate beyond its maximum value for a given concentration of the enzyme does not
result in an increased reaction rate. This observation yielded two important param-
eters of enzymatic reactions (KM and VMAX) and contributed to many important
discoveries involving enzymes.
The activity of enzymes goes beyond synthesizing a speciﬁc protein-ligand com-
plex (as in the case of antibodies or receptors) and involves an independent catalytic
attack on a selected bond within the ligand, precipitating its conversion into the ﬁnal
product. The relative independence of both processes (binding of the ligand in the

active site and catalysis) is evidenced by the phenomenon of noncompetitive inhibi-
tion, where the Michaelis-Menten constant remains unchanged despite a cessation
of enzymatic activity in the presence of an inhibitor. This proves that the process of
catalysis (dependent on coordinated action of numerous aminoacids and, optionally,
a coenzyme) is orthogonal to the enzyme’s capability to bind the ligand. Kinetic
studies of enzymes have provided valuable insight into the properties of enzymatic
inhibitors—an important ﬁeld of study in medicine and drug research. Some in-
hibitors, particularly competitive ones (i.e. inhibitors which outcompete substrates
for access to the enzyme), are now commonly used as drugs.
While proteins are among the most basic structures whose involvement in bi-
ological processes may be described as active and in spite of the fact that nearly
all biological activity is protein-based, it should be noted that some biological pro-
cesses occur on the RNA level. Ribozymes (which perform a handful of biological
functions) appear to be among the most primordial active structures in biology.
Proteins are capable of functioning both as receptors and effectors. They may
also actively transmit biological signals (e.g. kinases), although the role of passive
carriers usually falls to non-protein structures (peptides, steroids etc.). The distinction

to all functional proteins, irrespective of their location and task. Effector structures
include enzymes, ion pumps and channels, proteins involved in transcription of
genetic material, proteins which regulate muscle contraction, etc.
With respect to the locations and properties of proteins, we can generally
distinguish the following groups (see Table 1.1):

1.1
General Physiochemical Properties of Biological Structures
23
1. cellular proteins
2. proteins belonging to organism level
Since cells and organisms exist as distinguishable (though interrelated) biological
entities, their respective proteins serve different purposes and can therefore be treated
as separate groups. Cellular proteins are found inside cells and in cellular membranes,
while organism’s proteins are present in interstitial cavities and in blood.
Cellular functional proteins are usually globular and often associated with enzy-
matic or regulatory functions, although in certain types of cells (such as myocytes)
proteins governing contraction and relaxation may have a ﬁbrillar structure. Another
important subgroup consists of cytoskeletal proteins.
Membrane proteins also tend to be globular; however they are clearly distinct
from intracellular proteins with respect to their structure and task. Unlike water-
soluble proteins, they expose hydrophobic residues on their surface. This property
is required for integration with cellular membranes. Membrane proteins responsible
for interfacing with the external environment include receptors, pumps and structures
which facilitate cell adhesion and interaction.
Interstitial structures are apart from polysaccharides mostly composed of support
proteins. A wholly distinct group of proteins can be found in blood. Their task is
to mediate organ-to-organ communication, ensure homeostasis and perform a wide
array of protective functions, e.g. immune response, blood coagulation, inhibition
of proteolytic enzymes etc.
1.1.5
Energy and Information Storage Structures
Sequestration of resources is subject to two seemingly contradictory criteria:
1. Maximize storage density;
2. Perform sequestration in such a way as to allow easy access to resources.
In order for any system to gracefully tolerate variations in the availability of raw
resources and demand for products, storage capabilities are required. Such capa-
bilities augment the system’s autonomy, permitting continued operation even when
crucial resources are temporarily lacking or products cannot be disseminated. In
most biological systems, storage applies to energy and information. Other types of
resources are only occasionally stored (this includes e.g. iron, which is consumed
in large amounts yet infrequently available—sequestration of iron is mediated by a
dedicated protein called ferritin).
Energy is stored primarily in the form of saccharides and lipids. Saccharides are
derivatives of glucose, rendered insoluble (and thus easy to store) via polymerization.
Their polymerized forms, stabilized with α-glycosidic bonds, include glycogen (in
animals) and starch (in plantlife). An important side effect of this type of bonding
is the formation of twisted polymer chains, limiting packing density but enabling
easy access. Glycosidic links are usually of type 1–4 (sometimes 1–6), giving rise

The Structure and Function of Living Organisms
Fig. 1.21 Hypothetical packing of DNA strands into chromosomes. The ﬁgure depicts consecutive
stages of DNA coiling. Relative dimensions of elements are distorted in order to emphasize packing
strategies
to branching, treelike structures which can be readily manipulated by enzymes due
to the multitude of potential points of contact (see Fig. 1.12).
It should be noted that the somewhat loose packing of polysaccharides, com-
pounded by the presence of partially oxygenated carbons and relatively high degrees
of hydration, makes them unsuitable for storing large amounts of energy. In a typical
human organism only ca. 600 kcal of energy is stored in the form of glycogen, while
(under normal conditions) more than 100,000 kcal exists as lipids. Lipids deposit
usually assume the form of triglycerides (triacylglycerols). Their properties can be
traced to the similarities between fatty acids and hydrocarbons. Storage efﬁciency
(i.e. the amount of energy stored per unit of mass) is twice that of polysaccharides,
while access remains adequate owing to the relatively large surface area and high
volume of lipids in the organism.
Most living organisms store information in the form of tightly-packed DNA
strands. Once neutralized with histones (in eukaryotic organisms), DNA can be
wound on a protein scaffold, as depicted in Fig. 1.21.
The principles of efﬁcient packing and easy access apply here as well, precluding
the simplest possible packing of DNA—multilayered coiling (akin to winding a
thread on a spool). All forms of solidlike structures are inefﬁcient and therefore
unusable. The most effective form of DNA packing involves looping the strand
and winding it around a chromosomal scaffold so that each loop can be accessed
separately and each fragment uncoiled without unwinding the entire chain. This
model can roughly be compared to the arrangement of books on library shelves,
enabling unobstructed access to each book (Fig. 1.22).
DNA packing begins by arranging it on histones. However, ﬁnal packing consists
of several stages. Histone-centered loops can be further coiled, creating a tight spiral
with a microscopic thickness of 30 nm. In such a coiled thread, each loop is indepen-
dently attached to a protein scaffold which forms the backbone of the chromosome.

1.2
Self-Organization
25
Fig. 1.22 The library as an information storage model, allowing easy access to books. Similar
strategies can be observed in DNA packing
The ﬁnal rate of compression (compared to the length of the uncoiled strand) is ap-
proximately 10,000-fold. It should be noted that only a small percentage of DNA
(about few %) conveys biologically relevant information. The purpose of the remain-
ing ballast is to enable suitable packing and exposure of these important fragments.
If all of DNA were to consist of useful code, it would be nearly impossible to devise
a packing strategy guaranteeing access to all of the stored information.
1.2
Self-Organization
All complex cellular structures are the result of self-organization. In this process,
simple elements spontaneously generate complex structures by connecting to one
another in a predetermined way, usually with noncovalent bonds. The function of the
cell is limited to synthesis of startup elements for self-organization. Figure 1.23 de-
picts this phenomenon by comparing the concept of self-organization with deliberate
ordering.
Controlled self-organization applies only to evolved structures oriented on as-
sociation, e.g. water-soluble structural components which are thermodynamically
unstable (metastable) and try to maximize their relative stability by reaching a global
energy minimum. For obvious reasons, this process usually applies to partly polar
structures immersed in aqueous solutions; however it may also be observed in polar
structures where tight packing eliminates the possibility of interaction with water
(note that the presence of water tends to inhibit noncovalent interactions between
separate units). The cooperative interaction may be the driving force facilitating re-
moval of water e.g. folding of α-helical polypeptide chains stabilized by hydrogen
bonds.

piction). Construction of a scaffold via A deliberate activity, B spontaneous process. In the latter

structure
The structure of the aggregate depends on the structure of its components. Self-
association yielding coherent structures can be viewed as a type of self-organization.
Examples of self-association include the growth of planar phospholipid micelles and
folding of polypeptide chains. In general, self-organization is most often based on
nocovalent interactions where the associable domain elements achieve (through ran-
dom collisions) the most energetically stable form for a given set of environmental
conditions. Fibrillar supporting structures are intrinsically passive. Their aggrega-
tion is a consequence of relatively large contact surfaces. On the opposite end of
the activity spectrum, cells guide the process of self-organization by altering the
concentrations of substrates and the order in which they are exposed; however, they
are usually unable to directly affect the process itself (with certain exceptions where
the cell synthesizes structures capable of interfering with self-organization—such as
chaperones).
Self-organization may also occur as a result of speciﬁc interactions such as the
contact between proteins and ligands in active sites.
Fibrillar molecules tend to form parallel clusters. If special structures (e.g. planar
or three-dimensional forms) are required or if atypical separation between parallel
monomers becomes necessary, the cell may synthesize ﬁbrillar units with attached
globular fragments. Such fragments condition the emergence of speciﬁc aggregates
(a similar process can be observed in the development of intermediate ﬁlaments).
In most cases, however, the ﬁnal form of the product is a result of the function of
independent globular proteins, sometimes called accessory proteins (Fig. 1.24).
This is similar to the ﬁnal assembly of furniture or pipe segments using connectors
in order to achieve the required conﬁgurations (Fig. 1.24-right).

H.1. Protein Folding Simulation Hypothesis—Late Stage
Intermediate—Role of Water
Side chain interactions are critically important in determining the structure of the
late-stage (LS) form. Modelling this structure is consistent with acknowledging the
inﬂuence of non-bonding factors (electrostatic, van der Waals and torsion potentials
for groups of atoms where relative spacing depends on rotation around speciﬁc bond).
The energy minimization procedure is thus extended to account for the inﬂuence of
water. In Kauzman’s oil drop model, where each protein molecule is treated as an
“oil drop”, the inﬂuence of hydrophobic bonds on the folding process is particu-
larly pronounced. Comparing the protein to a drop of oil means that hydrophobic
aminoacids should be placed at its core, while hydrophile aminoacids are exposed on
the surface. The model presented in this handbook acknowledges such interactions
in optimizing the energy of the polypeptide chain. Hydrophobic interactions are only
indirectly involved (they do not have a corresponding component in the energy ﬁeld
equation), however the aqueous nature of the environment effectively determines
the ﬁnal structure of the chain. The protein folds in an environment which can be
described by a hydrophobicity gradient—a three-dimensional Gauss function. Its
values are interpreted as a distribution of hydrophobicity density, which reaches its
maximum at the center of the ellipsoid and decreases as we move towards the sur-
face of the emerging molecule, assuming a value close to 0 on its surface (Fig. 1.25).
Introducing the Gauss function allows us to extend the oil drop model to a so-called
fuzzy oil drop model.
Theenvironmentaloptimizationcriterioncanbeexpressedasadifferencebetween
the expected value of the Gauss function and the value which is actually observed
by measuring interactions between aminoacids.

Simulating the polypeptide folding process involves a steady reduction in the
volume of the drop (Fig. 1.25) until a density comparable to that of actual proteins
is reached.
Internalization of hydrophobic aminoacids, combined with the exposure of hy-
drophilic amino acids on the surface of the molecule, results in the formation of
a hydrophobic core, which is consistent with observational evidence. However, an
ideal match between the actual and theoretical (Gauss) distribution of aminoacids
yields a protein which is perfectly soluble in water yet devoid of any biological
function and incapable of interacting with other molecules.
Comparing the distribution of hydrophobicity in actual proteins (in their crys-
talline form) with the idealized Gauss function suggests certain mismatches which
are characteristic of the protein’s function. For instance the  ˜H proﬁle (Fig. 1.26)
of a sample protein (3DRC), where ligand-binding aminoacids (tagged in the ﬁg-
ure) represent  ˜H maxima, indicates that hydrophobic ligands are in fact bound by

thataminoacidswithhigh ˜H valuesbelongtostructuralpockets, capableofbinding
hydrophobic ligands and thus compensating for their relatively low hydrophobicity
given the place they occupy in the structure of the protein.
Proﬁle maxima are interpreted as deﬁciencies in hydrophobicity which can be
compensated for by attaching a hydrophobic ligand. The structure of the presented
protein proves the correctness of the model.
 ˜H proﬁle minima indicate amino acids which are overly hydrophobic given
their structural alignment. Their presence on the protein surface corresponds to sites
which can potentially form complexes with other proteins via hydrophobic interac-
tions. Sample distributions of hydrophobicity (both theoretical and observed) in a
“fast folding” protein (1CSP) as well as in selected antifreeze proteins (preventing
water from freezing in hibernating organisms) are depicted in Fig. 1.27. In this case
close correspondence between the predicted and actual distribution suggests that the
folding process proceeds in accordance with the theoretical model.
The black line in the top image indicates the actual (observed) distribution while
the colored line represents the theoretical (Gauss) distribution. The bottom image
shows differences between both distributions, exposing areas of excess hydropho-
bicity (local minima) as well as hydrophobicity deﬁciencies (local maxima). The
relatively small differences between both models and the lack of signiﬁcant plateaus
(compared to Fig. 1.26) suggest nonspeciﬁcity in interaction with potential ligands.

The Structure and Function of Living Organisms
In this context, analysis of the  ˜H proﬁle may be applied for predicting the
biological activity of a given protein molecule.
Returning to the folding process (and to its in silico simulations) we should note
that most proteins are highly speciﬁc in binding ligands.  ˜H proﬁle analysis has to
account for the presence of ligands in the folding environment. The Gauss ellipsoid
(representing the hydrophobic environment) must include the ligand, which—owing
toitsowndistributionofhydrophobicity—entersaspeciﬁcalignmentwiththeemerg-
ing protein and therefore ensures that the folding process results in the formation of
a binding site speciﬁc to that particular ligand.
Similarly, the presence of highly hydrophobic areas on the protein surface can be
explained by the late-stage (LS) form coming into contact with other, similar proteins
during the folding process.
There are ongoing research projects which attempt to simulate protein folding in
accordance with the modiﬁed “fuzzy oil drop” model in the presence of ligands and
other proteins.

Energy in Biology—Demand and Use
A coupled energy source is a prerequisite of sustained dynamics
in thermodynamically open systems.
Abstract From the point of view of energy management in biological systems,
a fundamental requirement is to ensure spontaneity. Process spontaneity is nec-
essary since in a thermodynamically open system—such as the living cell—only
spontaneous reactions can be catalyzed by enzymes. Note that enzymes do not, by
themselves, contribute additional energy. Spontaneity of biological processes may
be expressed by the following correlation:
G = H −TS where G means the change of free energy, H—change of
enthalpy, S—change of entropy, T—temperature. Desirable processes which do
not occur on their own must be coupled to other highly spontaneous mechanisms
serving as energy sources. In biology, the fundamental sources of energy involve
synthesis of water and photosynthesis. Since both processes are rather complex and
cannot be exploited directly, they are used to synthesizeATP which acts as an energy
carrier. Approaching biology from the point of view of elementary physics and
chemistry reveals important mechanisms and enhances our understanding of various
phenomena.

General Principles of Thermodynamics
Physical and chemical processes may only occur spontaneously if they generate
energy, or non-spontaneously if they consume it. However, all processes occurring
in a cell must have a spontaneous character because only these processes may
be catalyzed by enzymes. Enzymes merely accelerate reactions; they do not
provide energy.
In the inanimate world non-spontaneous (endergonic) reactions, including most
synthesis processes, consume thermal energy. In a cell, chemical energy can be
derived from exergonic (energy-producing) processes.An important source of energy
in living organisms is sunlight—the driving force in photosynthesis.

Energy in Biology—Demand and Use
Due to high susceptibility of living organisms to heat damage, thermal energy is
inconvenient.
Catalysis of inherently non-spontaneous processes becomes possible only when
they are thermodynamically coupled to other, spontaneous processes in such a way
that the resulting complex process dissipates energy.
Examples of inherently non-spontaneous processes which acquire spontaneity by
relying on exergonic reactions include:
1. synthesis;
2. structural rearrangement of proteins (e.g. in muscle contraction).
Processes related to degradation are usually spontaneous by nature and most of their
stages do not require additional exergonic processes as a source of energy.
In physical terms, spontaneity is subject to Gibb’s deﬁnition, where ΔG (change
in free energy) corresponds to ΔH (change in enthalpy) and ΔS (change in entropy),
according to the following equation
G = H −T S
T temperature in ◦K
The change in enthalpy associated with a chemical process may be calculated as a
net difference in the sum of molecular binding energies prior to and following the
reaction.
Entropy is a measure of the likelihood that a physical system will enter a given
state. Since chaotic distribution of elements is considered the most probable, physical
systems exhibit a general tendency to gravitate towards chaos. Any form of ordering
is thermodynamically disadvantageous.
According to the presented formula, energy loss and the corresponding increase
in entropy (ΔH and S) are the hallmarks of a spontaneous process.
For speciﬁc processes, the change in free energy may be determined without
referring to the presented mechanism and instead relying on reaction dynamics;
speciﬁcally—on the ratio of product and substrate concentrations:
G = G0 + RT ∗Ln{([C] ∗[D])/([A] ∗[B])}
R Gas constant
T Absolute temperature
The G0 parameter is a measure of spontaneity. It depends on the properties of
process elements and is therefore a function of the state of equilibrium. It may
be derived from the ratio of product and substrate concentrations once a state of
equilibrium has been reached.
If the process is in equilibrium, G becomes equal to 0 and thus, according to
the formula, G0 is given as:
G0 = −RT {Ln(K)}

The ﬁgure depicts three types of communicating vessels in which the liquid has
reached a state of equilibrium corresponding to various ratios of “products” (right
vessel) and “substrates” (left vessel). The table (in Fig. 2.1) presents some numerical
examples of the relation between K and G0.
The true measure of spontaneity is therefore not G0 but G, which expresses
the capability to perform work for a reaction which is not in a state of equilibrium.
In contrast, G0 merely indicates the reactivity of substrates as a consequence of
their physical and chemical nature.
A reaction which is in a state of equilibrium cannot perform useful work.
Energy can only be extracted from processes which have not yet reached equilibrium.
Maintaining a steady state of nonequilibrium is possible only in a thermodynam-
ically open environment where energy and reaction components may ﬂow through
the system. This, in turn, calls for an external source of energy as well as a means of
automatic control (see Fig. 2.1).
Any spontaneous reaction can be treated as a source of energy as long as its spon-
taneity is sufﬁcient for the thermodynamically disadvantageous reaction to occur and
provided that both processes are thermodynamically coupled. In practice, synthesis
reactions may only draw energy from highly spontaneous processes due to the need
to form covalent bonds.
The chemical reactions which power biological processes are characterized by
varying degrees of efﬁciency. In general, they tend to be on the lower end of the
efﬁciency spectrum, compared to energy sources which drive matter transformation
processes in our universe.
In search for a common criterion to describe the efﬁciency of various energy
sources, we can refer to the net loss of mass associated with a release of energy,

according to Einstein’s formula:

The M/M coefﬁcient (relative loss of mass, given e.g. in %) allows us to compare
the efﬁciency of energy sources. The most efﬁcient processes are those involved in
the gravitational collapse of stars. Their efﬁciency may reach 40 %, which means that
40 % of the stationary mass of the system is converted into energy. In comparison,
nuclear reactions have an approximate efﬁciency of 0.8 %.
The efﬁciency of chemical energy sources available to biological systems is
incomparably lower and amounts to approximately 10−7 % (Fig. 2.2).
Among chemical reactions, the most potent sources of energy are found in
oxidation processes, commonly exploited by biological systems. Oxidation tends

2.2
Biological Energy Sources—Synthesis of Water
37
to result in the largest net release of energy per unit of mass, although the efﬁciency
of speciﬁc types of oxidation varies. For instance, the efﬁciency of hydrogen-halogen
reactions (expressed in kcal/mol), calculated as the balance of binding energies, is
as follows:
H2+F2 = 2HF
104 + 37 = 2 ∗135(kcal/mol)
H = 129(kcal/mol)
H2+Cl2 = 2HCL
104 + 58 = 2 ∗103(kcal/mol)
H = 44(kcal/mol)
H2+Br2 = 2HBr
104 + 46 = 2 ∗87.5(kcal/mol)
H = 25(kcal/mol)
Under similar conditions the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen yields an aver-
age of 56.7 kcal/mol. It should come as no surprise that—given unrestricted access to
atmospheric oxygen and to hydrogen atoms derived from hydrocarbons—the com-
bustion of hydrogen (i.e. the synthesis of water; H2 + 1/2O2 = H2O) has become
a principal source of energy in nature, next to photosynthesis, which exploits the
energy of solar radiation.
2.2
Biological Energy Sources—Synthesis of Water
Hydrogeniscombinedwithoxygenoninnermitochondrialmembrane, whilethecon-
version of hydrogen carriers (lipids, sugars and proteins) into forms appropriate for
water synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial matrix. Major energy-
generating metabolic pathways include glycolysis, β-oxidation and degradation of
aminoacids.
The basic process associated with the release of hydrogen and its subsequent
oxidation (called the Krebs cycle) is carried by processes which transfer electrons
onto oxygen atoms (Fig. 2.3).
Oxidation occurs in stages, enabling optimal use of the released energy. An im-
portant byproduct of water synthesis is the universal energy carrier known as ATP
(synthesized separately).
As water synthesis is a highly spontaneous process, it can be exploited to cover
the energy debt incurred by endergonic synthesis of ATP, as long as both processes
are thermodynamically coupled, enabling spontaneous catalysis of anhydride bonds
in ATP.
Water synthesis is a universal source of energy in heterotrophic systems. In con-
trast, autotrophic organisms rely on the energy of light which is exploited in the
process of photosynthesis. Both processes yield ATP along with reduced pyridine
nucleotides.
As mentioned above, linking the spontaneous process of water synthesis with
non-spontaneous creation of anhydride bonds in ATP is a prerequisite for achieving
a thermodynamically uniﬁed system. This is done by introducing a hydrogen ion
gradient which affects both processes, although in different ways:

and electrons, and must therefore be able to dissociate or attach hydrogen ions,
enabling their transduction across the mitochondrial membrane and giving rise to an
ion gradient;
B.ATP synthesis—by exploiting the energy released in the spontaneous discharge
of the hydrogen ion gradient.
The hydrogen atoms used to synthesize water in the respiratory chain are de-
rived from nutrients and can directly participate in the chain by way of the Krebs
cycle (TCA). Nutrients include sugars (mostly glucose), aminoacids and lipids,
which reach hepatocytes following absorption from the small intestine. The energy
they carry is exploited in sequestration processes (mainly fatty acid synthesis and
lypogenesis) (Fig. 2.4).
During periods of starvation, hydrogen carriers can be retrieved from storage:
glucose comes from glycogen while fatty acids are extracted from adipose tissue.
Under conditions of high physical exertion or inadequate food intake, the ex-
traction of lipids increases and most of the released energy is used to resynthesize
glucose from aminoacids (Fig. 2.5).

Biological Energy Sources—Synthesis of Water

Dehydrogenation of substrates is catalyzed by pyridine- and ﬂavin-linked de-
hydrogenases. Respiratory chain proteins integrated in the mitochondrial membrane
transport hydrogen atoms and electrons onto oxygen (O2) molecules across the poten-
tial gradient, via complexes I, III and IV—namely NADH dehydrogenase (complex
I) and coenzyme Q; cytochrome bc1 complex reductase (complex III); cytochrome
c and ﬁnally cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). Hydrogen atoms released by de-
hydrogenation of succinate are introduced to the respiratory chain via complex II
(succinate dehydrogenase) and coenzyme Q, skipping complex I (Figs. 2.3, 2.4 and
2.5).
Complexes I, III and IV are integrated in the membrane. In contrast, coenzyme
Q (mediating capture of electrons by complex III) and cytochrome c are mobile,
although the former is located within the membrane while the latter is found in the
intermembrane space. The double-electron NAD dehydrogenase initiator changes to
a conduit for univalent electron carriers (iron-sulfur proteins, cytochromes) and a
four-electron channel in the last phase of oxygen reduction.
Watersynthesisultimatelyresultsinphosphorylation, which(inthiscase)converts
ADP to ATP. Since an anhydride bond must be created, there is a need of energy.
ATP synthesis must therefore be coupled to the synthesis of water if spontaneity is to
be maintained. The link is effected by introducing a hydrogen ion gradient between
the mitochondrial matrix and the intermembrane space, which, requires ejecting of
hydrogen ions into the inter-membrane space in the course of electron transportation
for synthesis of water. The structures responsible for transporting ions must do so in
a predetermined direction and maintain functional speciﬁcity. This task, like many
others, is performed by dedicated proteins.
Ion transport is usually effected by a protein-speciﬁc change in pK of selected
proton-binding groups, similar to the Bohr effect which occurs in hemoglobin. Trans-
duction of hydrogen ions from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space
works against the emerging ion gradient. Thus, protein ion channels must also fulﬁll
the role of a sluice gate. Electron carriers participating in the highly spontaneous
process of water synthesis in the membrane also act as transverse carriers of hy-
drogen ions. Thus owing to the mutual dependence of both ways of transport, the
non-spontaneous formation of an ion gradient may draw energy from the oxidation
process.
A suitable direction of transduction is ensured by maintaining proper alignment
and integration of hydrogen and electron carrier proteins in the membrane so that
protons are captured and released on speciﬁc sides (either within the mitochondrial
matrix or in the intermembrane space). The structure of membrane proteins and their
localization in the membrane is well suited to this task. Their apolar aminoacids and
their shape enforce the correct alignment and integration of protein molecules in the
membrane (Fig. 2.6).
The ability to transport hydrogen ions is a property of proteins forming complexes
I and IV. In complex III a similar function is most likely performed by coenzyme Q.
Its speciﬁc structure and integration with the membrane, as well as its interaction with
proteins ensures unidirectional ion transfer. Coenzyme Q is an apolar, non-protein
mobile molecule, consisting of a quinone derivative ring and a polyisoprenyl chain

Fig. 2.6 Various forms of
protein-membrane integration
(gray zones indicate

which, in humans, contains 10 elements. The carbonyl groups of the quinone ring
may undergo reduction by a hydrogen ion or by an electron (Fig. 2.7).
A proton may also dissociate from the hydroxyl group, leaving behind an anionic
residue.
According to the most widely accepted hypotheses, the ubiquinone molecule
(coenzyme Q) is able to rotate in the hydrophobic area of the membrane, coming
into contact with integrated respiratory chain proteins and mediating the transduction
of electrons and hydrogen ions. Through reduction (with an electron) the carboxyl
group assumes a polar form and migrates from the membrane to the aqueous envi-
ronment where it immediately attracts a proton (as its pK precludes the existence
of a dissociated form in a non-alkaline environment). Subsequently, a protonated
ubiquinone again becomes apolar and returns to the hydrophobic zone of the mem-
brane. While rotating it encounters cytochrome b and releases an electron, converting
to semiquinone or quinone.
The presence of iron-sulfur proteins within the mitochondrial matrix, and of cy-
tochrome b in the intermembrane space, results in a situation where the shortest
proton transport route across the membrane is the one provided by ubiquinone. The
source of energy powering this process is the electrons transport carried by the res-
piratory chain (Fig. 2.8). A suitable arrangement of respiratory chain proteins is
therefore crucial for coupling ATP synthesis to the synthesis of water.
The process depends on respiratory chain proteins being integrated and properly
aligned in the membrane (either on the side of the matrix or in the intermembrane
space) as well as on the presence of mobile ubiquinone molecules.
The arrangement of proteins which participate in binding hydrogen ions and trans-
porting electrons across the membrane is such that electron transduction follows

the intermembrane space with the participation of ubiquinone
changes in the oxidation-reduction potential. A proof of structural ordering can be
found in the stability of complexes I, II, III and IV, even in their isolated forms.
All enzymes connected with hydrogen and electron transportation are permanently
integrated in the membrane with exception of few TCA cycle dehydrogenases and
cytochrom c. For obvious reasons, this does not apply to NADH dehydrogenases
which participate in the Krebs cycle in the mitochondrial matrix. Also the loose
bond between the membrane and cytochrome c, facilitating its mobility and abil-
ity to bind electrons, is most likely maintained in order to mask variations in the
availability of oxygen while simultaneously enabling the concerted transfer of four
electrons onto an oxygen molecule with the aid of cytochrome c oxidase:
4 cyt c red + 4H+ + O2 => 4cyt c ox + 2H2O
Cytochrome c molecules, loosely integrated with the membrane on its dorsal surface
(i.e. within the intermembrane space), may therefore act as an electron reservoir,
maintaining the consistency of the respiratory chain.
2.3
ATP Synthesis
The structure responsible for creating a high-energy anhydride bond in the process
of converting ADP to ATP is a dedicated protein complex called ATP synthase—a
mushroom-shaped structure anchored in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is a
very efﬁcient machine, drawing power from the hydrogen ion gradient which itself
emerges as a result of water synthesis. In order to achieve spontaneous synthesis
of an anhydride bond, discharge of the ion gradient must release signiﬁcantly more

energy than the ATP synthesis process consumes. The synthase complex undergoes
rotation which results in reordering of its structural components. It is capable of
synthesizing approximately 100 ATP molecules per second, discharging 3 protons
per molecule, although its speciﬁc mechanism of action remains still unclear.
It seems valid to assume that changes in the structure of the synthase effected by
the ion gradient should result in shifting the ADP substrate (bound to the active site)
and the phosphate group to an environment characterized by low polarity. According
to this theory, the ATP molecule, which is less polar than the substrates used in
its synthesis (ADP and P) and which tends to undergo spontaneous hydrolysis in
the presence of water, becomes now easier to synthesize following a change in
environmentalconditions. Thus, achangeinpolaritydrivenbysynthesisofwatermay
reversethedirectionofspontaneitymakingtheprocessofATPsynthesisspontaneous.
An alternative hypothesis assumes that the reversal in the spontaneity of ATP
hydrolysis is a result of local acidiﬁcation. It can be observed that rate of ATP
hydrolysis decreases rapidly in low-pH environments. The high susceptibility of
ATP to pH changes in the neutral space is a consequence of changes in pK of the
−OH moiety, which migrates from an alkaline area (in a free phosphate group) to
an area with pH = 6.95 (in ATP).
It is also likely that both mechanisms (reversal in polarity and acidiﬁcation) come
into play simultaneously. Observational evidence seems to propose even more con-
vincing theory suggesting that the structural rearrangement of synthase components
results in the creation of a binding site with high afﬁnity for ATP, far exceeding its
corresponding afﬁnity for ADP. This effect negates the spontaneity of ATP hydroly-
sis; however it also introduces a very strong bond between the enzyme and the ATP
molecule, making it difﬁcult to release the product. This is why the process requires
a source of motive power (the aforementioned ion gradient discharge), driving struc-
tural changes in the synthase complex. Once the gradient is restored, the synthesis
process may repeat itself (Fig. 2.9).

Preparing nutrients (hydrogen carriers) for participation in water synthesis follows
different paths for sugars, lipids and proteins. This is perhaps obvious given their
relative structural differences; however, in all cases the ﬁnal form, which acts as a
substrate for dehydrogenases, is acetylo-CoA (Fig. 2.10).
Sugars are converted into acetyl-CoA in the glycolysis process, following oxida-
tive pyruvate decarboxylation; fatty acids undergo β-oxidation while proteins are
subject to hydrolysis, deamination and some changes in their hydrocarbon core.
Aside of water synthesis, part of the energy required to form high-energy bonds
comes from oxygenation of carbon atoms. The glycolysis process affords two
molecules of ATP as a result of glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate oxidation (Fig. 2.11).
Thisprocessisanexampleofsubstrate-levelphosphorylationandoccursinthecell
cytoplasm. As a result, high-energy anhydride (1,3-biphosphoglycerate) and ester
bonds (phosphoenolpyruvate) are created directly within the substrate, respectively
through dehydrogenation and dehydration respectively.

Oxydation of carbon atoms yields acetyl-CoA as a product of the thiolysis process
involved in β-oxidative degradation of fatty acids. The energy gain resulting from
carbon oxidation covers the cost of synthesis of acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA in the
course of oxidative decarboxylation of α-keto acids.
2.4
Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is a process which—from the point of view of electron transfer—can
be treated as a counterpart of the respiratory chain. In heterotrophic organisms, mito-
chondria transport electrons from hydrogenated compounds (sugars, lipids, proteins)
onto oxygen molecules, synthesizing water in the process, whereas in the course of
photosynthesis electrons released by breaking down water molecules are used as a
means of reducing oxydised carbon compounds (Fig. 2.12).
In heterotrophic organisms the respiratory chain has a spontaneous quality (owing
to its oxidative properties); however any reverse process requires energy to occur. In
the case of photosynthesis this energy is provided by sunlight (Fig. 2.13).
The reduction process consumes solar energy by way of dedicated protein “anten-
nae” which contain chlorophyll and carotenoids, each capable of capturing photons
and transferring their energy to electrons. The system resembles the macroscopic
model of a pumped-storage hydroelectric power plant (Fig 2.14.) which uses ex-
cess energy to pump downstream water back to its upper reservoir during nighttime.
When the demand for energy increases (during daylight hours), water can ﬂow back
to the lower reservoir, generating power. Clearly, this direction of ﬂow is sponta-
neous, while pumping water back to the upper reservoir consumes energy. A direct
counterpart of this process in the scope of synthesis of NADPH+ + H+ reductors is
its reliance on light energy, used to excite electrons extracted from water molecules.

Hydrogen combustion and photosynthesis are the basic sources of energy in
the living world. As they are subject to common laws of physics, their operating
principles resemble those observed in many macroscopic systems (Fig. 2.15).

Direct and Indirect Exploitation of Energy Sources
Direct exploitation (direct coupling of spontaneous and non-spontaneous processes
to an energy source).
The ability to exploit an energy source enables processes to maintain a state
of nonequilibrium. As mentioned above, only these types of processes may occur
spontaneously and be of use to biological entities. For an energy source to become
useful, non-spontaneous reactions must be coupled to its operation, resulting in a
thermodynamically uniﬁed system. Such coupling can be achieved by creating a
coherent framework in which the spontaneous and non-spontaneous processes
are linked, either physically or chemically, using a bridging component which
affects them both. If the properties of both reactions are different, the bridging
component must also enable suitable adaptation and mediation. In a water mill, the
millstone shaft couples water ﬂow (which acts as an energy source) to the work
performed by quern-stones. A car engine combusts gasoline, using the released
energy to impart motive force to the wheels. In some situations both processes (the
spontaneous one and the non-spontaneous one) may share similar characteristics—
for instance, skiers may propel themselves down a slope in order to effortlessly ski
up the opposite slope. In this case, both processes involve skiing and are therefore
similar; however a prerequisite of coupling is that both slopes need to be in close
proximity to each other (otherwise the energy gained in the descent would be lost).
Direct exploitation of the energy released via the hydrolysis ofATP is possible
usually by introducing an active binding carrier mediating the energy transfer.

process. Active carriers are relatively short-lived and exist either in the active site

of an enzyme or as independent substrates. In the latter case, they can be treated as
distinct componentsofcellularmetabolicpathways. ExamplesincludePRPP,UDPG,
active mediators of cholesterol synthesis and others. If the phosphorylation resulting
from ATP hydrolysis yields a low-energy compound (such as glucose-6-phosphate),
the reaction may consist of a single stage and its product is not an active carrier. The
energy released via hydrolysis of ester bonds in glucose-6-phosphate is insufﬁcient to
cover the cost of creating a new chemical bond. The net change in free energy (G0)
associated with hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate is approximately 3.3 kcal/mol,
whereas synthesis costs 4.0 kcal/mol [−7.3−(−3.3) = −4.0 kcal/mol]. Since the
binding energy for a typical chemical bond is on the order of 3 kcal/mol, the energy
stored in the ester bond of glucose-6-phosphate cannot cover the cost of synthesizing
additional compounds. On the other hand, synthesis of glucose-6-phosphate is a
spontaneous process and the cell has no problem deriving this compound (Fig. 2.16).
In most synthesis reactions ATP is only involved at an intermediate stage, where
its energy covers the cost of creating a new ester, amide, thioester or similar bond.
Any active carrier which performs its function outside of the active site must be
sufﬁciently stable to avoid breaking up prior to participating in the synthesis reaction.
Such mobile carriers are usually produced when the required synthesis consists of
several stages or cannot be conducted in the active site of the enzyme for sterical
reasons. Contrary to ATP, active energy carriers are usually reaction-speciﬁc.
Examples of active carriers include acid anhydrides and other types of compounds
(especially thioesters and esters). Mobile energy carriers are usually formed as a re-
sult of hydrolysis of two high-energy ATP bonds. In many cases this is the minimum
amount of energy required to power a reaction which synthesizes a single chemi-
cal bond. The adenosine residue often generates an active carrier in addition to a
reaction product while the dissociated pyrophosphate group undergoes hydrolysis,
contributing to the spontaneity of the process and limiting its reversibility (Fig. 2.17).
Expelling a mobile or unstable reaction component in order to increase the spon-
taneity of active energy carrier synthesis is a process which occurs in many biological
mechanisms, including decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA at the initial stage of fatty
acid synthesis and decarboxylation of oxaloacetate at the initial stage gluconeogene-
sis, where an easily-diffunding carbon dioxide molecule is ejected from the reaction
site (Fig. 2.18)

The action of active energy carriers may be compared to a ball rolling down a
hill. The descending snowball gains sufﬁcient energy to traverse another, smaller
mound, adjacent to its starting point. In our case, the smaller hill represents the ﬁnal
synthesis reaction (Fig. 2.19).
Common energy carriers include for example pyrophosphate containing com-
pounds (cholesterol synthesis intermediates, UDP-glucose PRPP); carboxybiotin
(active carbon dioxide), S-adenosyl methionine (active methyl group) and many
others (Fig. 2.20).

If an active energy carrier is created and subsequently consumed to form a new
bond within the active site of the enzyme, synthesis of that enzyme’s product may
become energetically advantageous. What is more, correct alignment of substrates
in the active pocket increases their likelihood of coming into contact with each other
and therefore contributes to the spontaneity of the synthesis reaction. To illustrate
this process, let us consider the formation of an amide bond in glutamine. This
reaction involves an active carrier (mixed acyl-phosphate anhydride), synthesized
at the cost of one high-energy ATP bond (Fig. 2.21). In this case, the energy of the
carrier is comparable to that of the source. A similar situation occurs in the synthesis
of phosphocreatine.

2.5
Direct and Indirect Exploitation of Energy Sources
53
Proper alignment of substrates in the active pocket ensures direct contact,
mimicking increased concentrations of both substances.
ATP + creatine <=> ADP + phosphocreatine
The process is not inherently spontaneous (ΔG0 = 3 kcal/mol); however its direction
can be determined by changes in the concentration ofATP in myocytes between work
and rest periods. Thus, phosphocreatine acts as a reservoir of high-energy bonds,
accumulating while the muscle is at rest and resynthesizing ATP when physical
effort is required.
Understanding the role of active carriers is essential for the study of metabolic
processes.
A second category of processes, directly dependent on energy sources, involves
structural reconﬁguration of proteins, which can be further differentiated into low-
and high-energy reconﬁguration. Low-energy reconﬁguration occurs in proteins
which form weak, easily reversible bonds with ligands. In such cases, structural
changes are powered by the energy released in the creation of the complex. The
scope of reconﬁguration depends on the packing of the protein and on its stability.
Packing a folded, single-chain native protein results in a relatively stable structure,
immune to signiﬁcant changes which may result from the creation of a noncovalent
protein-ligand bond. As a rule, the protein assumes the structural conﬁguration cor-
responding to its global energy minimum. However, it may also temporarily stabilize
in a local minimum (if the associated energy is not signiﬁcantly greater than that of
the global minimum). In most cases, such an intermediate structure is inherently
unstable and the protein spontaneously refolds to its most stable conﬁguration.
Important low-energy reconﬁguration processes may occur in proteins which
consist of subunits. Structural changes resulting from relative motion of subunits
typically do not involve signiﬁcant expenditures of energy. Of particular note are
the so-called allosteric proteins—for instance hemoblobin (hemoglobin T (tens) ⇔
hemoglobin R (relaxed)), whose rearrangement is driven by a weak and reversible
bond between the protein and an oxygen molecule. Allosteric proteins are geneti-
cally conditioned to possess two stable structural conﬁgurations, easily swapped as a
result of binding or releasing ligands. Thus, they tend to have two comparable energy
minima (separated by a low threshold), each of which may be treated as a global
minimum corresponding to the native form of the protein. Given such properties,
even a weakly interacting ligand may trigger signiﬁcant structural reconﬁguration.
This phenomenon is of critical importance to a variety of regulatory proteins.
In many cases, however, the second potential minimum in which the protein
may achieve relative stability is separated from the global minimum by a high
threshold requiring a signiﬁcant expenditure of energy to overcome. For proteins
associated with motor functions or other difﬁcult structural changes, the ligand must
be a high-energy compound which “pays” for the thermodynamically disadvanta-
geous structural change by forming an active complex with the protein. Contrary to
low-energy reconﬁgurations, the relative difference in ligand concentrations is insuf-
ﬁcient to cover the cost of a difﬁcult structural change. Such processes are therefore
coupled to highly exergonic reactions such as ATP hydrolysis. Figure 2.22 depicts
this type of situation.

(Fig. 2.22 C1); ATP-bound structure (Fig. 2.22 C2); contracted structure resulting
from hydrolysis of a high-energy bond (Fig. 2.22 C3) prior to releasing the products
of this reaction. Relaxation of myosin (Figs. 2.22 C3 and C1) is a highly spontaneous
process, capable of performing useful work (Figs. 2.22 C4, 2.23 and 2.24). Phases
1–4 are depicted in Figs. 2.23, 2.24 and 2.25. Catalysis of structural changes by high-
energy bonds is not limited to motor proteins—it can also be observed in ribosomes,
microtubule synthesis, protein G functions and many other biological processes.

directly coupled to energy sources (stages a, b, c, catalyzed respectively by hexokinase, phos-
phofructokinase-1 and pyruvate kinase)
The equation:
G = G0 + RT ∗Ln {([C] ∗[D])/([A] ∗[B])}
indicates that reactions may acquire spontaneity if substrate concentrations increase
and/or product concentrations decrease (since these are the only variables in the
equation). However, an exogenous process is needed to supply substrates and absorb
products so that the cell can maintain a state of balanced nonequilibrium purely
through regulation.
Being part of an organism, the cell is usually provided with reaction substrates and
may expel unneeded products. The energy debt incurred in this process is covered by
other types of cells. For instance, high levels of glucose required for its spontaneous
absorption by muscle cells (where it can power glycolysis) are maintained by hepatic
metabolism. Figure 2.26. depicts the spontaneity of glycolysis as a function of ΔG0,
compared with observed values of ΔG in blood cells.
As can be seen, many stages of glycolysis are not inherently spontaneous (in
terms of ΔG0). Empirically determined ΔG values indicate that cells maintain their
spontaneity by exploiting both direct (phosphorylation) and indirect links to energy
sources. Limiting major changes in ΔG to stages where direct coupling comes into
play (Fig. 2.26 a, b and c) means that these stages are effective in control of the
entire process. ΔG0 values observed at each stage indicate that the process can
easily be reversed (except that ATP molecules are not resynthesized— steps A and
B; and only highly spontaneous phosphoenolopyruvate synthesis (step C) energetic
threshold is crossed.
Indirect coupling may also beneﬁt processes associated with low-energy struc-
tural reconﬁguration of proteins (mostly allosteric ones). Such processes are usually
powered by changes in ligand concentrations and not by direct links to exergonic
reactions. Examples include hemoglobin, receptors, regulatory enzymes etc.

2.6
Energy Conversion Efﬁciency in Biological Processes
57
In general, high-energy reconﬁgurations exploit direct coupling mechanisms
while indirect coupling is more typical of low-energy processes (however, an impor-
tant exception to this rule is the coupling of water synthesis toATP synthesis effected
by the hydrogen ion gradient).
2.6
Energy Conversion Efﬁciency in Biological Processes
It is impossible to exploit all the energy released by a source. Any system
characterized by 100 % efﬁciency would effectively become a perpetuum mobile.
We may therefore ask why lossless exploitation of energy is undesirable. The
answer lies in the fundamental contradiction between high conversion efﬁciency and
the quantity of conserved energy. Let us again refer to the example of a skier going
downhill except this time there are many skiers and the aim is to propel oneself as far
up the opposite slope as possible. While analyzing the outcome of the competition
we will note that the relative density of skiers increases up until a certain elevation
and begins to drop off beyond that point. Peak efﬁciency (the number of skiers
multiplied by the attained elevation) occurs at approximately 30–40 % of the total
elevation of the slope. This value corresponds to the peak fraction of energy which
may be exploited in a spontaneous process.
Once the competition is over, each skier is again in possession of stored energy
which can pay for further, spontaneous downhill descent. The total number of skiers
positioned behind the starting line on the initial slope (at a certain elevation) is
equivalent to the total potential energy of the process, while the ﬁnal distribution
of skiers on the opposite slope can be treated as a measure of conserved energy.
The difference between both values (potential and conserved energy) is the free
energy (ΔG) dissipated during the process while ensuring its spontaneity. Assuming
a statistical distribution of skier skill we can predict that the amount of conserved
energy will increase up until a certain elevation (which can be reached by moderately
skilled skiers) and then begin to drop off, becoming equal to 0 at an elevation which
no skier is able to reach. The elevation reached by the best skier is still lower than
that of the starting line; otherwise we would be dealing with a perpetuum mobile,
i.e. a process which can generate energy despite its ΔG being 0 (Fig. 2.27).
The efﬁciency of biological processes is usually below 40 %. Synthesizing 1 mol
of water yields 56.7 kcal of energy, yet can only generate 3.0 mol (2.5 according to
some studies) of ATP yielding 7.3 kcal/mol each upon hydrolysis. Thus, the total
amount of conserved energy is not higher than 21.9 kcal/mol, which corresponds to
an efﬁciency of 37.4 %. It should, however, be remembered that this low efﬁciency is
the price paid for spontaneity, as more than 60 % of the energy released by the source
is dissipated. A typical human transforms 3 mol (approximately 1.5 kg) ofATP (ATP
⇔ADP) in one hour. Strenuous physical exertion may increase this demand by a
factor of 10, though the process itself is dynamic and, on average, no more than 0.1
mol of ATP exists in the organism at any given time.

2.7
Entropic Effects
The spontaneity of biological processes is a consequence of enthalpic and entropic
changes:
G = H −T ∗S
In most cases both phenomena have a measurable effect on spontaneity; however in
some situations one clearly dominates the other. In processes where covalent bonds
are formed or broken, enthalpy is usually more important than entropy, whereas syn-
thesis of protein complexes and many other noncovalently stabilized structures (such
as cellular membranes) relies primarily on entropic effects and is often powered by
thermodynamically disadvantageous rearrangement of water molecules, emerging
as a result of contact with water-repellent hydrophobic surfaces of compounds intro-
duced into the aqueous environment. Such compounds include e.g. polymer chains
or particular organic structures which contain apolar and polar moieties and are there-
fore water-soluble. In the latter case, aggregation occurs as a result of hydrophobic
interactions.
Hydrophobic interaction is not, strictly speaking, a chemical bond—instead,
it can be treated as a physical phenomenon related to the thermodynamically-
disadvantageous interaction between hydrophobic structures and water. Such in-
teraction introduces an entropic force which tries to destroy any structural ordering
of water resulting from contact with hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2.28). Aggrega-
tion is a means by which such thermodynamically undesirable changes (caused
by hydrophobic compounds intruding into the aqueous environment) are reversed.
Coupling hydrophobic surfaces to each other and stabilizing this aggregation with

noncovalent bonds (usually van der Waals bonds) lessens their exposure to water and

Synthesis applies to structures which are partly apolar but also contain polar
elements. It is necessary for such polar elements to be sufﬁciently large to dissolve,
thuspullingandexposingitsapolargroupstowater, and—asaconsequence—forcing
aggregation. This mechanism is one of the most basic forms of self-organization.
A classic example of self-association at work is the clustering of phospholipids in
the cellular membrane, which determines its tertiary structure (Fig. 2.29). Polypep-
tide chain folding is considered to be of fundamental importance to this process,
although our knowledge of its mechanisms is still somewhat limited. We do know

that in order for a tertiary structure to emerge, the polypeptide chain immersed in the
aqueous environment must exhibit a noneven distribution of polarity, corresponding
to non-random ordering of hydrophobic aminoacids. The apolar fragments of the
chain undergo aggregation, forming a hydrophobic core which, in turn, is encapsu-
lated by polar fragments. Such thermodynamically optimal folding of the polypeptide
chain determines the so-called native structure of the protein. The process is often
assisted by a special class of proteins called chaperones and its nature constitutes
one of the most important unresolved problems in modern biology. A fully folded
globular protein resembles a tightly-packed solid, although it usually includes an
active site pocket, which can be interpreted as a point of access to its apolar core.
The existence of such pocket is a prerequisite of forming protein-ligand complexes
in aqueous environments.
2.8
Energy Requirements of Organisms
Maintaining baseline biological processes requires a supply of energy. In humans, the
so-called basal metabolic rate (BMR) is approximately 1,500–2,000 kcal/day. Nor-
mal activity introduces additional demands; thus most humans burn approximately
2,000–2,500kcal/day, althoughstrenuousphysicalexercisemayincreasethisamount
to 5,000–10,000 kcal/day or even more. Energy demands are normally met through
consumption of food. Among nutrients the highest calorie content is found in lipids
(9.4 kcal/g). Sugars and proteins are somewhat less energetic, yielding 4.2 kcal/g
and 4.3 kcal/g respectively.
The following list illustrates the approximate calorie content of common food-
stuffs:

The average daily intake of carbohydrates (a major component of human diet) is
approximately 250 g, which corresponds to 1,000 kcal. If we assume that one mole
of glucose (180 g) affords 38 mol of ATP, 250 g of glucose can cover the cost of
synthesizing 52.8 mol of ATP, i.e. 385.3 kcal at an efﬁciency of 38.5 %. This value
matches stoichiometric studies of ATP/water synthesis, where 56.7 kcal of energy
released in the oxidation of hydrogen covers the cost of synthesizing three anhydrous
ATP bonds which can subsequently be hydrolyzed for an energy gain of 21.9 kcal.
Our calculation therefore assumes that synthesis of 1 mol of water affords 3 mol
(2.5 mol) of ATP.

Information—its Role and Meaning
in Organisms
Information determines the function of regulatory mechanisms
by reducing the entropy.
Abstract Information is necessary in regulatory mechanisms which maintain
a steady state of activity in individual cells as well as the whole organism. This
state corresponds to a genetically encoded program. Without regulation biological
processes would become progressively more and more chaotic. In living cells the
primary source of information is genetic material. Studying the role of information
in biology involves signaling (i.e. spatial and temporal transfer of information) and
storage (preservation of information).
Regarding the role of the genome we can distinguish three speciﬁc aspects of
biological processes: steady-state genetics, which ensure cell-level and body home-
ostasis; genetics of development, which controls cell differentiation and genesis
of the organism; and evolutionary genetics, which drives speciation. A systemic
approach to these phenomena must account for the quantitative and qualitative prop-
erties of information, explaining that the former are associated with receptor proteins
while the latter correspond to biological effectors.
The ever growing demand for information, coupled with limited storage capaci-
ties, has resulted in a number of strategies for minimizing the quantity of the encoded
information that must be preserved by living cells. In addition to combinatorial
approaches based on noncontiguous genes structure, self-organization plays an im-
portant role in cellular machinery. Nonspeciﬁc interactions with the environment
give rise to coherent structures despite the lack of any overt information store. These
mechanisms, honed by evolution and ubiquitous in living organisms, reduce the
need to directly encode large quantities of data by adopting a systemic approach
to information management. Our work represents an attempt to employ the similar
mechanisms in the teaching process.

Information—its Role and Meaning in Organisms
3.1
Information as a Quantitative Concept
The science of regulatory mechanisms has recently emerged from the shadow of
structural and functional research. Observational evidence indicates that most of
the information encoded in the genome serves regulatory purposes; hence scientiﬁc
interest in biological regulation is growing rapidly.
Our emerging knowledge of regulatory mechanisms calls for a quantitative means
of describing information. The twentieth century, and the 1940s in particular, have
brought about signiﬁcant progress in this matter, owing to the discoveries by N.
Wiener, G. Walter, W. R. Ashby, C. E. Shannon and others. In order to explain the
nature of information and the role it plays in biological systems, we ﬁrst need to
rehash our terminology.
Information is commonly understood as a transferable description of an event
or object. Information transfer can be either spatial (communication, messaging or
signaling) or temporal (implying storage).
From a quantitative point of view, information is not directly related to the content
of any particular message, but rather to the ability to make an informed choice
between two or more possibilities. Thus, information is always discussed in the
context of some regulated activity where the need for selection emerges.
Probability is a fundamental concept in the theory of information. It can be deﬁned
as a measure of the statistical likelihood that some event will occur.
If the selection of each element from a given set is equally probable, then the
following equation applies:
p = 1/N
where
N is the number of elements in the set.
Let us consider a car driving down a straight road. If the layout of the road does not
force the driver to make choices, the information content of the driving process is
nil. However, when forks appear and a decision has to be made, the probability of
choosing the correct exit is equal to p = 1/2, p = 1/3 or p = 1/5, for a two-, three- or
ﬁve-way fork respectively.
Choosing the correct route by accident becomes less probable as the number of
exits increases (Fig. 3.1).
If more than one exit leads to our intended destination, then the associated prob-
ability increases, becoming equal to 2/3, 3/5 or 4/5 for a ﬁve-way fork where 2, 3
or 4 exits result in the correct direction of travel. Clearly, if all exits are good, the
probability of making a correct choice is given as:
p = 5/5 = 1.0
The value 1.0 implies certainty: no matter which exit we choose, we are sure to reach
our destination.

varying numbers of exits
Probabilities are additive and multiplicative. Total probability is a sum of indi-
vidual probabilities whenever an alternative is involved, i.e. when we are forced to
choose one solution from among many, provided that some of the potential choices
arecorrectandsomearewrong. Ifafour-wayforkincludestwoexitswhichleadtoour
destination, the probability of accidentally making the right decision (i.e. choosing
one of the two correct exits) is equal to 1/2, according to the following formula:
p = p1 + p2 = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2
which means that, given four exits, the likelihood of choosing an exit that leads to our
destination is the sum of the individual probabilities of choosing any of the correct
exits (1/4 in each case).
If, in addition to the fork mentioned above, our route includes an additional ﬁve-
way fork with just one correct exit, we can only reach our destination if we make
correct choices on both occasions (this is called a conjunction of events). In such
cases, probabilities are multiplicative. Thus, the probability of choosing the right
route is given as:
p = (p1 + p2) ∗p3 = (1/4 + 1/4) ∗1/5 = 1/10
The larger the set of choices, the lower the likelihood making the correct choice by
accident and—correspondingly—the more information is needed to choose correctly.
We can therefore state that an increase in the cardinality of a set (the number of its
elements) corresponds to an increase in selection indeterminacy. This indeterminacy
can be understood as a measure of “a priori ignorance”. If we do not know which
route leads to the target and the likelihood of choosing each of the available routes
is equal, then our a priori ignorance reaches its maximum possible value.
The difﬁculty of making the right choice depends not only on the number of
potential choices, but also on the conditions under which a choice has to be made.
This can be illustrated by a lottery where 4 of 32 numbers need to be picked.
The probability of making one correct selection is 4/32. The probability that two
numbers will be selected correctly can be calculated as a product of two distinct
probabilities and is equal to:
p2 = (4/32) ∗(3/31)
Similarly, the probability that all of our guesses will be correct is given as:
p4 = (4/32) ∗(3/31) ∗(2/30) ∗(1/29), which is equal to pWIN = 0.0000278.

The above value denotes our chances for winning the lottery. In contrast, the corre-
sponding probability of a total loss (i.e. not selecting any of the four lucky numbers)
is pLOSS = 0.5698. If someone informs us that we have lost and that not a single one
of our selections was correct, we should not be surprised, as this is a fairly likely
outcome. However, a message telling us that we have won carries a far higher infor-
mation content—not due to any emotional considerations but because the odds of
winning are extremely low.
In 1928 R. V. L. Hartley deﬁned information quantity (I) as:
I = −log2(p) [bit]
(For a base-2 logarithm the result is given in bits).
Referring to the above example, the information quantity contained in a message
indicating that we have won the lottery is given as:
IWIN = −log20.0000278 = 15.2 [bit]
A corresponding message informing us of a total loss carries signiﬁcantly less
information:
ILOSS = −log20.5698 = 0.812 bit
The bit is a basic unit of information, corresponding to the quantity of information
required to make a choice between two equally probable events or objects.
In the above example we focused on two unambiguous scenarios, i.e. hitting the
jackpot (all selections correct) or losing entirely (all selections incorrect). If you wish
to learn more, consider following example.
Arriving at a probabilistic measure of entropy requires us to consider all pos-
sible outcomes (called realizations). This includes partial wins. For example: the
probability of getting exactly two numbers right is:
p(2) = 4/32 ∗3/31 ∗28/30 ∗27/29
+ 4/32 ∗28/31 ∗3/30 ∗27/29
+ 4/32 ∗28/31 ∗27/30 ∗3/29
+ 28/32 ∗4/31 ∗3/30 ∗27/29
+ 28/32 ∗27/31 ∗4/30 ∗3/29
+ 28/32 ∗4/31 ∗27/30 ∗3/29
(3.1)
This expression corresponds to the likelihood of arriving at the same end result (two
correct guesses) in various ways (C—correct guess; W—wrong guess):
CCWW + CWCW + CWWC + WCCW + WWCC + WCWC
As the goal can be reached in 6 different ways and the probability of each sequence
is equal, we may calculate the value of p(2) using a simpliﬁed formula:
p(2) = 6 ∗[(3 ∗4 ∗27 ∗28)/(32 ∗31 ∗30 ∗29)]

In the case of our lottery which has ﬁve different outcomes (A—four correct guesses;
B—three correct guesses; C—two correct guesses; D—one correct guess and E—no
correct guesses) the measure of uncertainty is the average quantity of information
involved in making a selection.
C. E. Shannon was the ﬁrst to relate statistical uncertainty to physical entropy,
arriving at the formula:
H = −
n

i=1
pi log2(pi)
where
H information entropy;
n number of possible outcomes.
Determining H has practical consequences as it enables us to compare different,
seemingly unrelated situations.
H indicates the (weighted) average quantity of information associated with the
realization of an event for which the sum of all pi equals 1.
The mathematical formula for H in the case of the presented lottery is:
H = −0.36432 ∗log2 (0.36432) −0.06306 ∗log2 (0.06306)
−0.00311 ∗log2 (0.00311) −0.0000278 ∗log2 (0.0000278)
−0.5698 ∗log2 (0.5698) = 1.271
Theﬁrstcomponentrepresentsthe“1correctguess”outcome; thesecond—“2correct
guesses” and so on until the ﬁnal component where none of the selected numbers
are correct (Notice the sum of probabilities of all cases is equal to 1).
Entropy determines the uncertainty inherent in a given system and therefore rep-
resents the relative difﬁculty of making the correct choice. For a set of possible events
it reaches its maximum value if the relative probabilities of each event are equal. Any
information input reduces entropy—we can therefore say that changes in entropy are
a quantitative measure of information. This can be denoted in the following way:
I = Hi −Hr
where
Hi indicates initial entropy and
Hr stands for resulting entropy
Although physical and information entropy are mathematically equivalent, they are
often expressed in different units. Physical entropy is usually given in J/(mol*deg)
while the standard unit of information entropy is 1 bit.
Physical entropy is highest in a state of equilibrium, i.e. lack of spontaneity (G =
0,0) which effectively terminates the given reaction. Regulatory processes which
counteract the tendency of physical systems to reach equilibrium must therefore
oppose increases in entropy. It can be said that a steady inﬂow of information is a
prerequisite of continued function in any organism.

As selections are typically made at the entry point of a regulatory process, the
concept of entropy may also be applied to information sources. This approach is
useful in explaining the structure of regulatory systems which must be “designed”
in a speciﬁc way, reducing uncertainty and enabling accurate, error-free decisions.
One of the models which can be used to better illustrate this process is the behavior
of social insects which cooperatively seek out sources of food (Fig. 3.2).
Nonrandom pathing is a result of the availability of information, expressed e.g.
in the span of the arc (1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 of the circumference of a circle).
The ability to interpret directional information presented by a bee that has located
a source of food means that other bees are not forced to make random decisions.
Upon returning to the hive, the bee performs a “dance”, where individual movements
indicate the approximate path to the food source.
If no directional information is available, the dance is random as the source may
lie anywhere in relation to the hive. However, if there is speciﬁc information, the bee
traverses an arc, where the width (in relation to the full circumference of a circle)
corresponds to the quantity of information. For instance, if the bee traverses 1/16 of
the circumference of a circle (22.5 degrees), the quantity of the conveyed information
is 4 bits. Corrections can be introduced by widening the radius of the circle, along
the way to the target.

The ﬁre ant exudes a pheromone which enables it to mark sources of food and
trace its own path back to the colony. In this way, the ant conveys pathing information
to other ants. The intensity of the chemical signal is proportional to the abundance
of the source. Other ants can sense the pheromone from a distance of several (up to
a dozen) centimeters and thus locate the source themselves. Figure 3.2 and Table 3.1
present the demand for information relative to the distance at which information can
be detected by an insect, for a given length of its path.
The quantity of information required to locate the path at a distance of 2.5 cm is 3
bits. However, as the distance from the starting point increases and the path becomes
more difﬁcult to follow, the corresponding demand for information also grows.
As can be expected, an increase in the entropy of the information source (i.e. the
measure of ignorance) results in further development of regulatory systems—in this
case, receptors capable of receiving signals and processing them to enable accurate
decisions.
Over time, the evolution of regulatory mechanisms increases their performance
and precision. The purpose of various structures involved in such mechanisms can
be explained on the grounds of information theory. The primary goal is to select the
correct input signal, preserve its content and avoid or eliminate any errors.
3.2
Reliability of Information Sources
An information source can be deﬁned as a set of messages which assist the recipient
in making choices. However, in order for a message to be treated as an information
source, it must ﬁrst be read and decoded.
An important source of information is memory which can be further divided into
acquired memory and genetic (evolutionary) memory.
Acquired memory is the set of messages gathered in the course of an individual
life. This memory is stored in the nervous system and—to some extent—in the
immune system, both capable of remembering events and amassing experience.
However, a more basic source of information in the living world is genetic mem-
ory. This type of memory is based upon three dissimilar (though complementary)
channels, which differ with respect to the their goals and properties:

72

Information—its Role and Meaning in Organisms
1. Steady-state genetics, including the “software” required for normal functioning
of mature cells and the organism as a whole. This type of information enables
biological systems to maintain homeostasis;
2. Development genetics, which guides cell differentiation and the development of
the organism as a whole (also called epigenetics);
3. Evolutionary genetics, including mechanisms which facilitate evolutionary
progress.
Figure 3.3 presents a simpliﬁed model of the genome—a single chromosome with
all three channels indicated (dark bands—a conventional representation of the DNA
available for transcription of genetic material).
Dark bands represent conventionally the total volume of DNA, i.e. the DNA
available for transcription in a mature specialized cell.
The role of the genome is to encode and transfer information required for the syn-
thesis of self-organizing structures in accordance with evolutionary programming,
thereby enabling biological functions. Information transfer can be primary (as in
the synthesis of RNA and directly used proteins) or secondary (as observed in the
synthesis of other structures which ensure cell homeostasis).
3.2.1
Steady-state Genetics
Genetic information stored in nucleotide sequences can be expressed and transmitted
in two ways:
a. via replication (in cell division);
b. via transcription and translation (also called gene expression—enabling cells and
organisms to maintain their functionality; see Fig. 3.4)
Both processes act as effectors and can be triggered by certain biological signals
transferred on request.
Gene expression can be deﬁned as a sequence of events which lead to the synthesis
of proteins or their products required for a particular function. In cell division, the
goal of this process is to generate a copy of the entire genetic code (S phase), whereas
in gene expression only selected fragments of DNA (those involved in the requested
function) are transcribed and translated. Reply to the trigger comes in the form of
synthesis (and thus activation) of a speciﬁc protein. Information is transmitted via
complementary nucleic acid interactions: DNA—DNA, DNA—RNA and RNA—
RNA, as well as interactions between nucleic acid chains and proteins (translation).
Transcription calls for exposing a section of the cell’s genetic code and although
its product (RNA) is short-lived, it can be recreated on demand, just like a carbon
copy of a printed text. On the other hand, replication affects the entire genetic ma-
terial contained in the cell and must conform to stringent precision requirements,
particularly as the size of the genome increases.

3.2.2
Replication and its Reliability
The magnitude of effort involved in replication of genetic code can be visualized by
comparing the DNA chain to a zipper (Fig. 3.5). Assuming that the zipper consists
of three pairs of interlocking teeth per centimeter (300 per meter) and that the human
genome is made up of 3 billion (3 * 109) base pairs, the total length of our uncoiled
DNA in “zipper form” would be equal to 1 * 104 km, or 10,000 km—roughly twice
the distance between Warsaw and New York.
If we were to unfasten the zipper at a rate of 1 m per second, the entire unzipping
process would take approximately 3 months—the time needed to travel 10,000 km
at 1 m/s. This comparison should impress upon the reader the length of the DNA
chain and the precision with which individual nucleotides must be picked to ensure
that the resulting code is an exact copy of the source. It should also be noted that
for each base pair the polymerase enzyme needs to select an appropriate matching
nucleotide from among four types of nucleotides present in the solution, and attach
it to the chain (clearly, no such problem occurs in zippers).
The reliability of an average enzyme is on the order of 103–104, meaning that
one error occurs for every 1,000–10,000 interactions between the enzyme and its
substrate. Given this ﬁgure, replication of 3 * 109 base pairs would introduce ap-
proximately 3 million errors (mutations) per genome, resulting in a highly inaccurate
copy. Since the observed reliability of replication is far higher, we may assume that
some corrective mechanisms are involved.
Really, the remarkable precision of genetic replication is ensured by DNA repair
processes, and in particular by the corrective properties of polymerase itself. Its

enzymatic association with exonuclease acting in the 3′→5′ direction increases the
ﬁdelity of polymerization. DNA repair works by removing incorrect adducts and
replacing them with proper nucleotide sequences.
The direction of anti-parallel DNA strands is determined by their terminating
nucleotides or, more speciﬁcally, by their hydroxyl groups (the sole participants
of polymerization processes) attached to 3′ and 5′ carbons of deoxyribose. In the
5′→3′ direction a free nucleotide (5′-triphosphate nucleotide) may attach itself to
the 3′ carbon hydroxyl group, whereas in the opposite direction only the 5′ carbon
hydroxyl group may be used to extend the chain (Fig. 3.6).
The proofreading properties of polymerase are an indispensable condition of
proper replication of genetic material. However, they also affect the replication pro-
cess itself, by enforcing one speciﬁc direction of DNA synthesis—namely, the 5′→3′
direction (Fig. 3.7). For reasons related to the distribution of energy this is the only
direction in which errors in the DNA strand may be eliminated by cleaving the ter-
minal nucleotide and replacing it with a different unit. In this process, the energy
needed to create a new diester bond is carried by the free 5′-triphosphate nucleotide,
whereas in the 3′→5′ direction the required energy can only come from the termi-
nating nucleotide which thus cannot be cleaved for repair. Doing so would, however,
make it impossible to attach another nucleotide at the end of the chain. This is why
both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms can only accurately replicate their genetic
code in the 5′→3′ direction. An important consequence of this fact is the observed
lack of symmetry in replication of complementary DNA strands (Fig. 3.8).
Linear synthesis is only possible in the case of the 5′→3′ copy based on the 3′→5′
template. Synthesis of the 3′→5′ copy proceeds in a piecemeal fashion, through the
so-called Okazaki fragments which are synthesized sequentially as the replication
fork progresses and template loops are formed. This looping mechanisms results in
the desired 3′→5′ direction of synthesis (Fig. 3.8).

The polymerase enzyme itself exhibits as necessary both polymerase and exonu-
clease activity. We should hence note that the availability of a DNA template is
not sufﬁcient to begin polymerization. In order to attach itself to the chromatid and
commence the process, the polymerase enzyme must ﬁrst interface with a comple-
mentary precursor strand, which it can then elongate. This short fragment is called
a primer (Fig. 3.9). Its ability to bind to polymerase enzymes has been exploited in
many genetic engineering techniques.
The DNA replication fork involves an unbroken, continuous (though unwound)
template. Since polymerase cannot directly attach to either of its strands, the primer
must ﬁrst be synthesized by RNA polymerase (that is transcriptase). This enzyme
does not require a primer to initiate its function and can attach directly to the one
strained template.
Polymerase carries out DNA synthesis by elongating the RNA fragment sup-
plied to it by RNA polymerase. Therefore, each incidence of DNA synthesis must
begin with transcription. The transcriptase enzyme responsible for assisting DNA
replication is called the primase.
The synthesized RNA fragments are paired up with complementary nucleotides
and attached to the strand which is being elongated by DNA polymerase. They are

polymerase, which also exhibits exonuclease activity in the 3′→5′ direction
then replaced by DNA nucleotides and the complementation to template fragment

ture of polymerase itself are necessary for reducing the probability of erroneous
transcription.
Permanent changes introduced in the genetic transcription process are called mu-
tations. They can result from random events associated with the function of the
genome, or from environmental stimuli, either physical (e.g. UV radiation) or chem-
ical. Mutations which do not compromise the complementarity of DNA often go
unrecognized by proofreading mechanisms and are never repaired.
In addition to direct changes in genetic code, errors may also occur as a result
of the imperfect nature of information storage mechanisms. Many mutations are
caused by the inherent chemical instability of nucleic acids: for example, cytosine
may spontaneously convert to uracil. In the human genome such an event occurs
approximately 100 times per day; however uracil is not normally encountered in
DNA and its presence alerts defensive mechanisms which correct the error.
Another type of mutation is spontaneous depurination, which also triggers its own,
dedicated error correction procedure. Cells employ a large number of corrective
mechanisms—some capable of mending double-strand breaks or even recovering
lost information based on the contents of the homologous chromatid (Fig. 3.10)
DNA repair mechanisms may be treated as an “immune system” which protects the
genome from loss or corruption of genetic information.
The unavoidable mutations which sometimes occur despite the presence of error
correctionmechanismscanbemaskedduetodoubledpresentation(alleles)ofgenetic
information. Thus, most mutations are recessive and not expressed in the phenotype.
As the length of the DNA chain increases, mutations become more probable. It
should be noted that the number of nucleotides in DNA is greater than the relative
number of aminoacids participating in polypeptide chains. This is due to the fact that
each aminoacid is encoded by exactly three nucleotides—a general principle which
applies to all living organisms.
Information theory tells us why, given four available nucleotides, a three-
nucleotide codon carries the optimal amount of information required to choose one
of twenty aminoacids. The quantity of information carried by three nucleotides, each
selected from a set of four, equals I3 = −log2(1/4 ∗1/4 ∗1/4) = 6 bits, whereas
in order to choose one of 20 aminoacids, I20 = −log (1/20) = +4.23 bits of
information is required.
If the codon were to consist of two nucleotides, it would carry I2
=
−log2(1/4 ∗1/4) = 4 bits of information, which is insufﬁcient to uniquely identify

an aminoacid. This is why nucleotide triplets are used to encode aminoacids, even
though their full information potential is not exploited (a nucleotide triplet could
theoretically encode 4 ∗4 ∗4 = 64 amino acids).
If the DNA were to consist of only two base types, the minimum number of
nucleotides required to encode 20 aminoacids would be 5:
I = −log2(1/2 ∗1/2 ∗1/2 ∗1/2 ∗1/2) = −log2(1/32) = 5 bit
In this case, redundancy would be somewhat reduced but the DNA chain would be-
come far longer and the likelihood of harmful mutations would increase accordingly.
Considering the reliability of genetic storage mechanisms, the selected encoding
method appears optimal. We should, however, note that despite the presence of many
safeguards, errors cannot be completely eliminated.
3.2.3
Gene Expression and its Fidelity
Fidelity is, of course, fundamentally important in DNA replication as any harmful
mutations introduced in its course are automatically passed on to all successive

generations of cells. In contrast, transcription and translation processes can be more
error-prone as their end products are relatively short-lived. Of note is the fact that
faulty transcripts appear in relatively low quantities and usually do not affect cell
functions, since regulatory processes ensure continued synthesis of the required
substances until a suitable level of activity is reached.
Nevertheless, it seems that reliable transcription of genetic material is sufﬁciently
signiﬁcant for cells to have developed appropriate proofreading mechanisms, similar
to those which assist replication. RNA polymerase recognizes irregularities in the
input chain (which register as structural deformations) and can reverse the synthe-
sis process, cleave the incorrect nucleotide or even terminate polymerization and
discard the unﬁnished transcript. In the case of translation, the ribosome is gener-
ally incapable of verifying the correctness of the polypeptide chain due to encoding
differences between the polymer and its template. The speciﬁcity of synthesis is
associated with the creation of aa-tRNA and determined by the speciﬁc nature of the
enzyme itself. Any errors introduced beyond this stage go uncorrected.
Once a polypeptide chain has been synthesized, it must fold in a prescribed way in
order to fulﬁll its purpose. In theory, all proteins are capable of spontaneous folding
and reaching their global energy minima. In practice, however, most proteins misfold
and become “stuck” in local minima. (Alternatively, the global minimum may not
represent the active form of the protein and a local minimum may be preferable.)
This is why the folding process itself is supervised by special regulatory structures:
simple proteins (chaperones) or machinelike mechanisms (chaperonins), which work
by attaching themselves to the polypeptide chain and guiding its folding process.
Improperly folded structures are broken down via dedicated “garbage collectors”
called proteasomes. If, however, the concentration of undesirable proteins reaches
critical levels (usually through aggregation), the cell itself may undergo controlled
suicide called apoptosis. Thus, the entire information pathway—starting with DNA
and ending with active proteins—is protected against errors. We can conclude that
fallibility is an inherent property of genetic information channels, and that in order to
perform their intended function, these channels require error correction mechanisms.
The processes associated with converting genetic information into biologically
useful structures are highly complex. This is why polymerases (which are of key
importance to gene expression) are large complexes with machine-like properties.
Some of their subunits perform regulatory functions and counteract problems which
may emerge in the course of processing genetic information. In the case of synthesis,
the main goal of polymerases is to ensure equivalent synthesis of complete both anti-
parallel DNA strands. In contrast, transcription relies on proper selection of the DNA
fragment to be expressed. Problems associated with polypeptide chain synthesis
usually arise as a result of difﬁculties in translating information from nucleic acids
to proteins.
While the cell is in interphase its DNA is packed in the nucleus and assumes
the form of chromatin. During cell division the nucleus is subdivided into so-called
chromosome territories, each occupied by a pair of chromosomes. Densely-packed
fragments of DNA material, unavailable for transcription, constitute the so-called
heterochromatin, while regions from which information can potentially be read are
called euchromatin.

Expression of genetic information is conditioned by recognition of speciﬁc DNA
sequences which encode proteins. The information connected with protein function
is not, however, entirely determined by its coding fragment. Noncoding fragments
may store useful information, related to e.g. regulatory mechanisms, structure of
the chromatin strand (including its packaging), sites of speciﬁc aberrations such as
palindromes etc. Proper transfer of genetic information requires precise recognition
of its nucleotide arrangement.
Speciﬁc DNA sequences may be recognized by RNA or by proteins. RNA
recognition is straightforward, as both DNA and RNA share the same “language”.
Recognition of a nucleotide sequence by proteins poses more problems; however
some proteins have evolved the ability to attach to speciﬁc sequences (transcription
factors in particular). This mechanism is usually employed in the major groove of
the DNA double helix whose breadth admits contact with transcription mediators (it
should, however, be noted that the minor groove may also convey useful structural
information via relative differences in its width and the distribution of electrostatic
charges—see papers by T. Tullius and R. Rohs 2009). All such information can be
exploited by proteins in order to recognize their target sequences. Interaction be-
tween proteins and nucleotide sequences usually assumes the form of protein-RNA
complexes which include a short double-stranded transcripts consisting of approxi-
mately 20–30 nucleotides. Such non-coding RNA fragments can bind as single strand
pieces to proteins which exhibit some deﬁned properties (e.g. enzymes). Their pres-
ence ensures in the result that the protein acts in a highly targeted manner, seeking
out sequences which correspond to the attached RNA strand. Examples includeAGO
RNase enzymes as well as proteins whose function is to inhibit or destroy outliving
mRNA chains. They are thus important for maintaining biological balance within
the cell. Protein-RNA complexes also participate in untangling chromatin strands,
epigenetic processes, antiviral defense and other tasks.
The double-stranded form assumed by RNA prior to interacting with proteins
protects it from rapid degradation. Three groups of interfering RNA fragments have
been distinguished with respect to their length, means of synthesis and mechanism
of action (they are called miRNA, siRNA and piRNA respectively). The use of short
RNA fragments as “target guides” for proteins greatly increases the efﬁciency of
functional expression of genetic information (Fig. 3.11). By the same token, speciﬁc
RNA chains are also useful in translation processes. The ribosome is a nanomachine
whose function depends on precise interaction with nucleic acids—those integrated
in the ribosome itself as well as those temporarily attached to the complex during
polypeptide chain synthesis (tRNA). Good cooperation between proteins and nu-
cleic acids is a prerequisite of sustained function of the entire biological machinery
(Fig. 3.12). The use of RNA in protein complexes is common across all domains
of the living world as it bridges the gap between discrete and continuous storage of
genetic information.
The discrete nature of genetic material is an important property which distin-
guishes prokaryotes from eukaryotes. It enables the combinatorial gene splicing in
the course of transcription and promotes evolutionary development. The ability to
select individual nucleotide fragments and construct sequences from predetermined

“building blocks” results in high adaptability to environmental stimuli and is a fun-
damental aspect of evolution. The discontinuous nature of genes is evidenced by
the presence of fragments which do not convey structural information (introns), as
opposed to structure-encoding fragments (exons). The initial transcript (pre-mRNA)
contains introns as well as exons. In order to provide a template for protein synthesis,
it must undergo further processing (also known as splicing): introns must be cleaved
and exon fragments attached to one another. The process is carried out by special
complexes called spliceosomes, which consist of proteins and function-speciﬁc RNA
fragments. These fragments inform the spliceosome where to sever the pre-mRNA
strand so that introns may be discarded and the remaining exon fragments reattached
to yield the mRNA transcript template. Recognition of intron-exon boundaries is
usually very precise, while the reattachment of adjacent exons is subject to some vari-
ability. Under certain conditions, alternative splicing may occur, where the ordering
of the ﬁnal product does not reﬂect the order in which exon sequences appear in the
source chain. This greatly increases the number of potential mRNA combinations
and thus the variety of resulting proteins. Alternative splicing explains the clear

disparity between the number of genes in the genome and the variety of proteins
encountered in living organisms. It also plays a signiﬁcant role in the course of evo-
lution. The discontinuous nature of genes is evolutionarily advantageous but comes
at the expense of having to maintain a nucleus where such splicing processes can be
safely conducted, in addition to efﬁcient transport channels allowing transcripts to
penetrate the nuclear membrane. While it is believed that at early stages of evolution
RNA was the primary repository of genetic information, its present function can
best be described as an information carrier. Since unguided proteins cannot ensure
sufﬁcient speciﬁcity of interaction with nucleic acids, protein-RNA complexes are
used often in cases where speciﬁc fragments of genetic information need to be read.
Long RNA chains usually occur as single strands; however they can occasionally
fold into double strands which resemble proteins and can even perform protein-like
functions (including enzymatic catalysis, as observed in ribozymes). It should be
noted, however, that catalytic activity of RNA has nothing in common with the
natural RNA activity connected with sequence recognition and hence both activities
differs essentially.
In summary, we can state that the primary role of the genome and the informa-
tion contained therein is to sustain living processes and enable cells to convey the
mechanics of life to their offspring. This process depends on accurate expression
of DNA information in the form of proteins and on their activity, maintaining the
cell in a steady state what allows stabilizing biological processes in accordance with
genetically-programmed criteria.

Epigenetics
Epigenetics is a branch of science which studies the differentiation of hereditary
traits (passed on to successive generations of cells by means of cell division) through
persistent activation or inhibition of genes, without altering the DNA sequences

84

themselves. Differentiation is a result of chemical, covalent modiﬁcation of histones
and/or DNA, and the action of non-histone proteins which affect the structure of the
chromatin. Differentiation has no bearing on the ﬁdelity of information channels;
instead, it determines the information content, i.e. the set of genes released for
transcription.
Differentiation plays a key role in the expression of specialized cell functions (as
opposed to basic functions encoded by the so-called housekeeping genes, which are
relatively similar in all types of cells). Information stored in DNA can be accessed by
speciﬁc protein complexes which uncoil the chromatin thread and present its content
for transcription. This process is guided by markers: modiﬁed (usually methylated)
histone aminoacids and/or methylated DNA nucleotides. Modiﬁcations ensure the
speciﬁcity of binding between DNA and non-histone proteins, and therefore guide
the appropriate release of genetic information, facilitating biological development
and vital functions. Intracellular differentiation processes are initiated at speciﬁc
stages in cell development via RNA-assisted transcription factors. Their function
can be controlled by external signals (hormones), capable of overriding intracellular
regulatory mechanisms.
Epigenetic mechanisms are observed in the following processes:
1. embryogenesis and regeneration;
2. stem cell survival and differentiation (e.g. bone marrow function);
3. selective (single-allele) inheritance of parental traits (also called paternal and
maternal imprinting) including functional inhibition of chromosome X;
4. epigenetics of acquired traits.
Ad. 1.
3.2.5
Development Genetics (Embryogenesis and
Regeneration)—the Principles of Cell Differentiation
Epigenetic differentiation mechanisms are particularly important in embryonic de-
velopment. This process is controlled by a very speciﬁc program, itself a result
of evolution. Unlike the function of mature organisms, embryonic programming
refers to structures which do not yet exist but which need to be created through cell
proliferation and differentiation. The primary goal of development is to implement
the genetic blueprint—a task which is automated by sequential activation of suc-
cessive development stages in accordance with chemical signals generated at each
stage (Fig. 3.13). Similar sequential processing can be observed in cell division
which consists of multiple, clearly deﬁned stages. It should be noted that embryonic
development programs control both proliferation and differentiation of cells.
Differentiation of cells results in phenotypic changes. This phenomenon is the
primary difference between development genetics and steady-state genetics. Func-
tional differences are not, however, associated with genomic changes: instead they
are mediated by the transcriptome where certain genes are preferentially selected for
transcription while others are suppressed.

In a mature, specialized cell only a small portion of the transcribable genome
is actually expressed. The remainder of the cell’s genetic material is said to be
silenced. Gene silencing is a permanent condition. Under normal circumstances
mature cells never alter their function, although such changes may be forced in
a laboratory setting, e.g. by using viral carriers to introduce special transcription
factors associated with cellular pluripotency (Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Myc). A
similar reversal of aging processes is also observed in neoplastic tissue. Cells which
make up the embryo at a very early stage of development are pluripotent, meaning
that their purpose can be freely determined and that all of their genetic information
can potentially be expressed (under certain conditions). Maintaining the chromatin
in a change-ready state is a function of hormonal factors called morphogens (for
example the sonic hedgehog protein). At each stage of the development process the
scope of pluripotency is reduced until, ultimately, the cell becomes monopotent.
Monopotency implies that the ﬁnal function of the cell has already been determined,
although the cell itself may still be immature. This mechanism resembles human

As noted above, functional dissimilarities between specialized cells are not as-
sociated with genetic mutations but rather with selective silencing of genes. This
process may be likened to deletion of certain words from a sentence, which changes
its overall meaning. Let us consider the following adage by Mieczysław Kozłowski:
“When the blind gain power, they believe those they govern are deaf.” Depending on
which words we remove, we may come up with a number of semantically nonequiv-
alent sentences, such as: “When the blind gain power, they are deaf.” or “When the
blind gain power, they govern.” or even “The blind are deaf.” It is clear that selective
transcription of information enables to express various forms of content.
3.2.5.1
Molecular Licensing of Genes for Transcription
The “gene licensing” mechanism depends primarily on chemical modiﬁcations
(mostly methylation of histones, but also of DNA itself) and attaching the modiﬁed
chromatin to certain non-histone proteins. In addition to methylation, the activity of
a given gene may be determined by acetylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and/or
phosphorylation. However, the nature of the modifying factor is just one piece of the
overall puzzle. Equally important is the modiﬁcation site: for instance, methylation
of lysine at position 4 of histone 3 (H3K4) promotes transcription, while methyla-
tion of lysine at position 9 (H3K9) results in a different DNA-protein binding and
inhibits gene expression (Fig. 3.14). The degree of methylation (the presence of one,

two or three methyl groups) matters as well: triple methylation usually occurs at
positions 4, 9, 27 and 36 of histone 3, as well as at position 20 of histone 4. Positions
9 and 27 are particularly important for gene suppression because methylated lysine
acts as an acceptor for certain Polycomb proteins which inhibit transcription. On the
other hand, position 4 of histone 3 is associated with promotion of gene transcription
mediated by trithorax proteins.
Gene suppression may be reversed through detachment and/or demethylation
of the coupled proteins (Fig. 3.15A). Phosphorylation associated with introduction
of a negative charge promotes dissociation of inhibitors and is therefore useful in
regulatory mechanisms (Fig. 3.15B). It is interesting to note that phosphorylation
may also occur in histones: for instance, histone 3 includes serine units which bind
phosphoric acid residues at positions 10 and 28, i.e. directly adjacent to the lysine
units at positions 9 and 27, which (as noted above) inhibit transcription by binding
with additional proteins. Serine phosphorylation in histones controls the bonding
between DNA and non-histone proteins (which may also undergo phosphorylation).
On the other hand, removal of methyl groups is a function of speciﬁc demethylases.
In addition to lysine, histone methylation may also affect arginine, while direct
DNA methylation usually involves cytosine. Such modiﬁcations are often mutually
dependent (Fig. 3.16). Methylation is a rapid, covalent process and a convenient

way to directly tag the DNA chain as the replication complex progresses. It enables
cells to pass epigenetic information to their offspring and thus ensures its persistence
(Fig. 3.17). However, the ﬁnal decision on which genes to silence is a function of
non-histone proteins which bind to DNA in places marked via methylation (or other
forms of chemical modiﬁcation).
In contrast to methylation, acetylation usually promotes transcription. Many tran-
scription activators are in fact enzymes (acetyltransferases) and, consequently, many
gene suppressor proteins act by deacetylation. Non-histone proteins involved in
epigenetic processes either activate or inhibit transcription and may also modify
the structure of chromatin. DNA-protein complexes which act as gene suppressors

(for instance those involving Polycomb proteins) result in tighter packing of the
heterochromatin chain (the silent, non-transcribed part of the genome). Heterochro-
matin may be packed in at least four different ways, depending on the activity of
attached proteins; however we usually distinguish two broad categories: constitutive
(permanently suppressed) heterochromatin and facultative heterochromatin, which
may, under certain condition, be expressed (note that the structure which allows
transcription of genetic material is called euchromatin).
3.2.5.2
Speciﬁcity of Epigenetic Processes
The complicated chromatin modiﬁcation mechanism associated with cellular dif-
ferentiation is a consequence of the complex selection of genes which need to be
expressed or silenced in order to sustain biological activities at proper level. It can
be compared to a piano concerto where the pianist must strike certain keys in a se-
lected order at just the right time. Moreover, each stroke must have an appropriate
force, determining the volume and duration of the played note. Some keys are struck
separately while others need to be arranged into chords. All of these decisions are
subject to a form of programming, i.e. the notes written down by the composer of a
given piece.
The speciﬁcity of recognition and activation of certain nucleotide sequences for
transcription seems understandable if we assume that genes may be recognized by
transcription factors alone, or in collaboration with noncoding RNA fragments which
belong to the miRNA group. Both types of structures are capable of interfacing with
DNA regulatory sequences and thus selectively induce transcription of certain genes.
However, contrary to a piano concerto where the role of the pianist is simply to play
back the piece by striking certain keys only, the cell must also proactively manage
its silenced genes.
Chromatin methylation and other chemical modiﬁcations are a result of enzymatic
activity where the substrates (basal histone aminoacids and cytosine of DNA) reside
both within the transcribed parts of DNA and in sections which need to be silenced.
Clearly, this property may interfere with the selectivity of gene expression.
A solution emerges in the form of spatial isolation of certain DNA fragments and
exposing selected parts of the chain for enzymatic activity. This is only possible
during interphase when transcription and other enzymatic processes appear to be
concentrated in speciﬁc areas of the nucleus (sometimes called factories). These
areas accept “loosened” DNA coils, recognized and preselected by transcription
factors and/or RNA. Compartmentalization also prevents uncontrolled propagation
of catalysis (Fig. 3.18).
Spatial ordering of catalysis is important for epigenetic processes due to the great
variety of enzymatic interactions involved in cell differentiation. However, an even
more important self-control mechanism associated with enzymatic activity seems to
be its division into stages, where only selected types of enzymes seem to be active at
each stage. This greatly increases the selectivity of information channels and reduces
the potential for error (Fig. 3.13).

External Control of Cell Proliferation and
Differentiation—Embryonic Development
Each stage of differentiation can be activated automatically; however they all obey
steeringsignalswhichcomefromoutsideofthecell, i.e. fromothercells. Suchsignals
can be generated directly—by adjacent cells, or indirectly—by speciﬁc hormonal
markers called morphogens.
The duration of the signal and the concentration of a speciﬁc morphogen may
affect cell differentiation by triggering internal processes which subsequently operate
in accordance with predetermined sequential programs. Morphogen diffusion is,
however, somewhat peculiar: morphogens travel through clusters of densely packed
embroyonic cells and have to maintain a predetermined concentration at a given
distance from their originator in order to ensure proper strength of the signal they
encode. In order to fulﬁll these goals, morphogens are inherently short-lived and need

associated with different concentrations of a given morphogen
to be constantly replenished. They must also possess special means of traversing cell
clusters. It should be noted that the boundaries separating various tissues are usually
well delineated in spite of the diffusive nature of biological signals. This is due
to simultaneous action of contradictory signals, which results in the emergence of
unambiguous tissue boundaries (Fig. 3.19).
Each gene packet activated in the course of differentiation belongs to a certain
development stage. This alignment results in staged synthesis of various sets of pro-
teins and enzymes, each responsible for performing different actions. For instance,
in stem cells methylation affects CG and CA nucleotide clusters, whereas in ma-
ture, specialized cells no CA methylation is observed. Furthermore, as no cell is
completely independent of its adjacent cells, cellular development must proceed in
a coordinated fashion.
Coordinated propagation of information follows a hierarchical pathway, meaning
that information ﬁrst reaches key loci in the developing system and only then can
be disseminated to wider groups of recipients (genes). This process resembles a hu-
man population settling a new territory: initially, settlers decide upon administrative
boundaries and elect local authorities. Later on, these agreements may be amended as
a result of individual postulates and speciﬁc strategies developed in order to resolve
emerging problems and adapt to changing conditions.
Cells responsible for triggering new signal pathways need to be created in the
course of embryonic development. The emergence of new centers of activity and
new tissues results from cooperation of existing, differentiated cells. Cell prolif-
eration and mutual interactions proceed in accordance with the genetic program,
progressively giving rise to new structures. The spatial “blueprint” of the embryonic
mass is in place even before macroscopic details can be discerned; indeed, the pro-
cess of differentiation begins with the ﬁrst asymmetric division of the embryo. Cells

92

Information—its Role and Meaning in Organisms
which are already undergoing differentiation “remember” their position and place in
the development program—thus, they can be said to possess a speciﬁc “address” in
the overall structure of the organism. The placement of cells in a developing embryo
is determined by the hox gene family. In humans, these genes (of which there are
approximately 40) are activated sequentially during successive development stages.
Their action is to impose spatial alignment upon the growing mass of cells. Spatial
memory and information about the cell’s future role in the developing organism is
stored in its chromatin, conditioned to enable certain types of transcription. Gen-
eralized biochemical signals trigger speciﬁc responses in individual cells, guiding
the development process in each part of the embryo. Cell groups gain their epige-
netic “addresses” and “assignments” by reacting to signals in different ways, thus
enabling coherent growth. While the spatial arrangement of tissues were subjected to
some changes in the course of evolution, the general epigenetic control mechanisms
governing the differentiation of cell groups remained unchanged. An early strategy,
characteristic of invertebrates, is the division of the embryonic mass into segments
(see Fig. 3.29). However, as the notochord and (later on) the spine emerged, the dif-
ferentiation process had to evolve as well. Thus, a vertebrate embryo initially consists
of two distinct germ cell layers: endoderm and ectoderm. Their interaction gives rise
to a third layer called mesoderm. Further development and divergence of cell layers
result in the formation of a spine as a central core around which development may
progress.
Genetic control of cell mobility (involving entire cell layers as well as individual
cells) is facilitated by changes in the shape of cells, affecting their mutual adhesion.
Cell layers gain mobility by means of locally reduced or increased adhesion, itself a
result of the emergence or degradation of surface receptors (cadherins and integrins).
Other examples of epigenetic mechanisms
Ad. 2. (page 84) Stem cell survival and differentiation.
A special group of undifferentiated cells, called stem cells, may persist in mature
organisms in speciﬁc niches formed by adjacent cell layers. One example of such a
structure is bone marrow, where new blood cells are constantly being created.
Ad.3. (page 84) Selective inheritance of parental trials
Imprinting—Differentiation mechanisms can also be used to ensure monoallelic-
ity.
Most genes which determine biological functions have a biallelic representation
(i.e. a representation consisting of two alleles). The remainder (approximately 10 %
of genes) is inherited from one speciﬁc parent, as a result of partial or complete
silencing of their sister alleles (called paternal or maternal imprinting) which occurs
during gametogenesis. The suppression of a single copy of the X chromosome is a
special case of this phenomenon. It is initiated by a speciﬁc RNA sequence (XIST)
and propagates itself, eventually inactivating the entire chromosome. The process is
observed in many species and appears to be of fundamental biological importance.

3.2.6
The Genetics of Evolution
Contrary to steady-state genetics and development genetics, evolution exploits the
gene mutation phenomenon which underpins speciation processes. Duplication and
redundancy of genetic material is beneﬁcial as it enables organisms to thrive and
reproduce in spite of occasional mutations. Note that mutations which preclude
crossbreeding with other members of a given species can be said to result in the
emergence of a new species.
Evolutionary genetics is subject to two somewhat contradictory criteria. On the
one hand, there is clear pressure on accurate and consistent preservation of biolog-
ical functions and structures while on the other hand it is also important to permit
gradual but persistent changes. Mutational diversity is random by nature; thus evolu-
tionary genetics can be viewed as a directionless process—much unlike steady-state
or developmental genetics.
In spite of the above considerations, the observable progression of adaptive traits
which emerge as a result of evolution suggests a mechanism which promotes con-
structive changes over destructive ones. Mutational diversity cannot be considered
truly random if it is limited to certain structures or functions. In fact, some processes
(such as those associated with intensiﬁed gene transcription) reveal the increased
mutational activities. Strenuous transcription may induce evolutionary changes by
exposing cell DNA to stimuli which result in mutations. These stimuli include DNA
repair processes; particularly those which deal with double-strand damage. In this
respect, an important category of processes involves recombination and shifting of
mobile DNA segments.
Approximately 50 % of the human genome consists of mobile segments, capa-
ble of migrating to various positions in the genome. These segments are called
transposons and retrotransposons (respectively—DNA fragments and mobile RNA
transcripts which resemble retroviruses in their mechanism of action except that they
are not allowed to leave the cell).
The mobility of genome fragments not only promotes mutations (by increasing
the variability of DNA) but also affects the stability and packing of chromatin strands
wherever such mobile sections are reintegrated with the genome. Under normal cir-
cumstances the activity of mobile sections is tempered by epigenetic mechanisms
(methylation and the DNA-protein complexes it creates); however in certain situa-
tions gene mobility may be upregulated. In particular, it seems that in “prehistoric”
(remote evolutionary) times such events occurred at a much faster pace, accelerating
the rate of genetic changes and promoting rapid evolution.
Cells can actively promote mutations by way of the so-called AID process
(activity-dependent cytosine deamination). It is an enzymatic mechanism which con-
verts cytosine into uracil, thereby triggering repair mechanisms and increasing the
likelihood of mutations. AID is mostly responsible for inducing hypermutations in
antibody synthesis but its activity is not limited to that part of the genome. The ex-
istence of AID proves that cells themselves may trigger evolutionary changes and
that the role of mutations in the emergence of new biological structures is not strictly
passive.

3.2.6.1
Combinatorial Changes as a Diversity-promoting Strategy
Although the processes mentioned above may contribute to evolutionary changes
and even impart them with a certain direction, they remain highly random and
thus unreliable. A simple increase in the rate of mutations does not account for
the high evolutionary complexity of eukaryotic organisms. We should therefore seek
an evolutionary strategy which promotes the variability of DNA while limiting the
randomness associated with mutations and preventing undesirable changes.
This problem may be highlighted by considering the immune system which itself
must undergo rapid evolution in order to synthesize new types of recombinant pro-
teins called antibodies. As expected, antibody differentiation is subject to the same
deterministic mechanisms which have guided evolution throughout its billion-year
course but which remain difﬁcult to distinguish from stochastic evolutionary pro-
cesses. In the immune system, synthesis of new proteins (i.e. antibodies with new V
domains) proceeds by way of changes in aminoacid sequences (particularly in their
V, D and J DNA segments) through a mechanism which owes its function to high
redundancy of certain fragments of genetic code. DNA sequences which contain the
previously mentioned V, D and J segments may, upon recombination, determine the
structure of variable immunoglobulins: their light (V, J) and heavy chains (V, D, J)
(see Fig. 3.36).
A key advantage of recombination is that it yields a great variety of antibodies,
making it likely that an antibody speciﬁc to a particular antigen will ultimately be
synthesized. The degree of variability in L and H chains is determined by the number
ofpossiblecombinationsofV/JandV/D/Jsegments(forLandHchainsrespectively).
Constructing random genetic sequences via recombination is a process which may
occur far more frequently than creating new, complete genes from scratch. It enables
great genetic diversity in spite of the limited participating genome information and
is therefore preferable to gene differentiation. Antibody differentiation also relies
on one additional mechanism which triggers random changes in their active groups:
combination of light and heavy chains within the antigen binding site.
Combinatorial differentiation and antibody synthesis may roughly be compared
to the work of a cook who has to prepare meals for a large group of gourmands. Two
strategies may be applied here: 1. preparing a large number of varied meals; far more
than there are customers, and 2. preparing a selection of meal components (A—main
courses; B—salads; C—appetizers etc.) and allowing customers to compose their
own sets. Clearly, the latter solution is more efﬁcient and corresponds to strategies
which can frequently be observed in nature. The efﬁciency of combinatorial differen-
tiation is shown in Table 3.2, which presents a quantitative example of constructing
antibodies from segments of the heavy chain (H) and two forms of the light chain
(Lλ and Lκ). The degree of variability of each form is listed in Table 3.2A.As can be
observed, this variability is far greater than in the case of a single, nonrecombinant
chain consisting of all the above-mentioned segments.
The number of possible antibody sequences, given minimal variability of individ-
ual components, is listed inTable 3.2 B.Table 3.2 C presents values which correspond
to the highest possible variability of components.

Combinatorial differentiation yields a huge population of immunoglobulins, mak-
ing it exceedingly likely that at least some of them will be selectively adapted to their
intended purpose. Further structural improvements are possible as a result of hyper-
mutations restricted to the active protein group and induced by the AID process,
resulting in incremental synthesis of more specialized antibodies (afﬁnity matura-
tion). Thus, antibody synthesis is itself a microscale model of directed evolution,
enabling progressive improvement of its ﬁnal product.
Thus although mutations are the basic mechanism by which changes in nucleotide
sequences(and, consequently, aminoacidsequences)canbeintroduced, variabilityof
antibodies is not directly dependent on mutations. Rather, it is a result of recombinant
synthesis of diverse DNA fragments, each contributing to the structure of the ﬁnal
product. Such recombinant fragments emerge in the course of evolution, mostly via
duplication of genetic code and also (in a limited scope) via localized mutations
which do not affect the fundamental properties of the protein complex. The entire
process is similar to a tool with exchangeable parts, although in the case of antibodies
there is no “set of available parts”—rather, the given parts are synthesized on the ﬂy
from smaller subcomponents.
Combinatorial rearrangement of presynthesized DNA fragments (as opposed to
ad hoc mutations) is an evolutionarily favored means of achieving diversity. It can
rapidly accelerate DNA diversiﬁcation while restricting the likelihood of adverse
changes and errors associated with random mutations. The mechanism can be com-
pared to the use of numbers and letters in car license plates, which also affords a
great number of unique combinations.

In DNA, combinatorial diversiﬁcation requires that functional fragments of the
chain be clearly separated and well spaced. Long dividers enable proper folding of
the chain and assists in its combinatorial rearrangement. The discontinuing of genetic
code supports combinatorial genetics, but also facilitates the current gene expression
through alternative splicing of exon fragments whenever suitable mRNA chains need
to be synthesized. Thus, the number of intracellular proteins far exceeds the number
of individual genes which make up the genome. This phenomenon is similar to
recombination, although it applies to RNA. Alternative splicing, itself a result of
evolution, is an important contributor to evolutionary progress. Discontinuity is also
observed in the so-called cis-regulatory elements of the genetic code which may
be located far away from gene promoters. Such fragments include enhancers and
silencers, separated by special sections called insulators.
DNA fragments, recognized by transcription factors, can bind to polymerase
and guide its activity (Fig. 3.20). Regulatory fragments act as hooks for transcription
factors. Sets of genes associated with a single biological function often share identical
(or similar) enhancers and silencers, acted upon by a single transcription factor.

Such cooperation of genes can be compared to piano chords which consist of several
different notes but are struck by a single hand. The role of regulatory sequences
in evolutionary development is more signiﬁcant than that of actual protein codons
(exons).
Primitive organisms often possess nearly as many genes as humans, despite the
essential differences between both groups. Interspecies diversity is primarily due to
the properties of regulatory sequences. Evolutionary development promotes clear
separation of DNA fragments carrying information concerning structure and func-
tion, allowing genetic code to be recombined with ease. In humans the separators
between coding and non-coding DNA sequences (introns and exons) are among the
longest observed in any organism. It therefore appears likely that diversiﬁcation of
regulatory structures carries signiﬁcant evolutionary beneﬁts.
As already mentioned, evolutionary progress is associated with the scope and
diversity of regulatory sequences rather than with the number of actual genes. This is
due to the fact that regulatory sequences facilitate optimization of gene expression.
Returning to our metaphor we can say that the same grand piano can be used either by
a master pianist or by an amateur musician, although in the latter case the instrument’s
potential will not be fully realized, resulting in a lackluster performance.
The special evolutionary role of regulatory fragments is a consequence of their
noncoding properties. Contrary to genes, noncoding fragments are not subject to
structural restrictions: they do not need to be veriﬁed by the synthesis of specialized
proteins where mutations are usually detrimental and result in negative selection.
They also exhibit far greater variability than gene-encoding fragments. The mu-
tability of noncoding DNA fragments is aided by the fact that—owing to their
number—each fragment only contributes a small share to the overall regulatory
effect. This property reduces the potential impact of unproﬁtable mutations.
3.2.6.2
Directed Mutability: Hotspot Genes
The recombinant variability of regulatory fragments and of genes themselves is
sufﬁcient to explain the progress of evolution. Nevertheless, ongoing research sug-
gests the existence of additional mechanisms which promote evolution by increasing
mutability in focused and localized scopes. Not all genes are equally susceptible
to evolutionary pressure. Some can be termed “conservative” (i.e. undergoing few
changes in the course of evolution), while others are subject to particularly rapid
changes. The latter group is colloquially said to consist of hotspot genes. The rea-
son behind this variability is unclear; however it appears that high mutability may
emerge as a result of intense functional involvement or local instabilities in chromatin
structure. It is also observed that fragments directly adjacent to retrotransposons are
characterized by relatively packing alterations, which may accelerate the rate of mu-
tations. However, the most likely explanation has to deal with the presence of special
nucleotide sequences which reduce the overall stability of the DNA chain. Certain
observations attribute this role to short fragments dominated by a single type of nu-
cleotide (usually T or A) attached to longer sequences which are largely bereft of

98

Information—its Role and Meaning in Organisms
nucleosomes. Such structures are particularly conductive to random exchange of ge-
netic material between DNA coils, thereby promoting recombination and increasing
the rate of mutations.
If such accelerated mutability is restricted to speciﬁc DNA fragments, its destruc-
tive impact can be minimized and the mechanism may serve a useful purpose. It
seems that the placement of such sequences in the genome may assist in directed
evolutionary development. This is somewhat equivalent to the hypermutation pro-
cess in antibody synthesis, where increased mutational activity (caused byAID) only
applies to speciﬁc protein fragments ensuring an effective immune response without
signiﬁcantly altering the core structure of antibodies.
3.2.6.3
Gene Collaboration and Hierarchy
The placement of a given gene in the gene regulatory network may affect its transcrip-
tional activity. Each mechanism which contributes to the overall phenotype requires
the collaboration of many genes. The goal of such collaboration is to ensure balanced
responses to various stimuli and activate all the required genes. Collaborative systems
emerge via coupling of genes which together determine biological signals associ-
ated with transcription. Coherent activation of genes coding transcription factors is
a prerequisite for the formation of a so-called kernel.
Automatically-regulated collaborative systems may be likened to cybernetic
mechanisms. The impact of individual genes on collaboration processes is, how-
ever, unequal. Genes which occupy core nodes of regulatory networks (also called
input/output genes) are usually tasked with proper routing of biological signals. Their
intensefunctionalinvolvementandinteractionwithadvancedregulatorymechanisms
may result in increased susceptibility to mutations.
Regulatory mechanisms which assist in evolutionary development are themselves
subject to evolution—for instance through creation of new enhancers and silencers
or by increasing their relative spacing (similarly to introns). Gene regulation and
interaction (particularly in the scope of input/output genes) can also be improved.
Finally, the number of genes which encode transcription factors tends to increase over
time. Such changes can be explained by their positive effect on gene collaboration.
Referring to our “musical” example we can say that using all ten ﬁngers gives the
pianist far greater leeway than if he were to tap the melody with just one ﬁnger.
As mentioned above, the role of genes in collaborative systems differs from gene
to gene. Input/output genes are particularly important: it seems that they are the key
members of the so-called hotspot gene set. This observation is further supported by
their high involvement in transcription processes. It is theorized that the placement
of input/output genes in the genome is intimately tied to their evolutionary role. An
unambiguous proof of this theory would further conﬁrm the directed nature of evolu-
tion. Mechanisms which accelerate evolutionary development (such as duplication,
recombination based on discontinuity of genetic material and focused mutability)
indicate that evolutionary processes follow speciﬁc strategies which may themselves
undergo improvement. This, in turn, suggests the selective possibility of accelerating
evolution. One putative example of this phenomenon is the rapid development of the
Homo sapiens brain, often described as an “evolutionary leap”.

Biochemistryexplainshowgeneticinformationcanbeusedtosynthesizepolypeptide
chains. On the surface it might appear that information transferred to RNA and
subsequently to proteins is the only type of information present in the genome.
However, an important issue immediately emerges: in addition to what is being
synthesized, the living cell must also be able to determine how, where, when and
even to what extent certain phenotypic properties should be expressed.
The questions what? and when? involve structural properties, while terms such
as how? and how much? are more closely tied to function. The question how?
usually emerges whenever we wish to determine the role of a certain structure, its
synthesis process or its mechanism of action. Each of these aspects may also be
associated with the question how much?, i.e. a request for quantitative information.
This information is useful in determining the required concentrations of reagents,
their level of activity, the size of biological structures etc. Quantitative assessment
is important for any doctor who sends a biological sample to a diagnostics lab. Such
properties are static and must therefore have a genetic representation. If we assume
that, on a molecular level, structure determines function, we must also accept that
the structure of certain proteins determines their quantity.
As can be expected, quantitative regulation is a function of receptor structures,
each of which belongs to a regulatory chain. The question how much? is inexorably
tied to regulatory processes. It seems clear that the stable concentrations and levels of
activity observed in biological systems cannot be maintained without regulation. It is
equally evident that such regulation must be automatic since isolated cell cultures can
thrive and maintain their biological properties despite not being part of any organism.
Research indicates that biological regulatory mechanisms rely basically on neg-
ative feedback loops. Figure 3.21 presents the structure of such a loop. The heredity
of a biological function is not restricted to the speciﬁc effector which directly im-
plements it, but covers the entire regulatory chain, including receptor systems and
information channels.

Information—its Role and Meaning in Organisms
Fig. 3.22 Self-organization example: membrane formation
Quantitative control of the activity of various processes is facilitated by recep-
tors which measure product concentrations or reaction intensity. Each receptor is
connected to an effector which counteracts the observed anomalies. The receptor—
being a functional protein—contains an active site which it uses to form reversible
complexes with elements of the reaction it controls (usually with its products).
Typical receptors are allosteric proteins which undergo structural reconﬁguration
and release a signal whenever a ligand is bound in their active site. The equilibrium
constant—a measure of receptor-ligand afﬁnity—determines the concentration at
which saturation occurs and the receptor morphs into its allosteric form. As a conse-
quence, ligand concentration depends on the afﬁnity of its receptor and therefore on
its structure. The structure of the receptor protein determines the quantitative prop-
erties of the system as a whole, thus providing an answer to the how much? question.
In contrast, the how? issue is addressed by the structure of effector proteins.
Effectors may be either simple or complex, depending on the task they perform. In
a living cell, an effector may consist of a single enzyme, a set of enzymes facilitating
synthesis of a speciﬁc product, or an even more advanced machinelike structure.
In the regulatory mechanisms of organism effectors are often specialized tissues
or organs. A typical type of effector mechanism is involved in transcription and
translation processes.
The role of the effector is to stabilize the controlled process. Its structure may
address the what? and (possibly) where? questions associated with any biologi-
cally active entity, but it primarily relates to the how? question by determining the
mechanism applied for a given task, as requested by the receptor. We can state that
the genetic code (i.e. nucleotide sequence) describes the primary structure of re-
ceptor, effector and transfer structures. A regulatory loop (negative feedback loop)
is a self-contained functional unit which performs a speciﬁc task in an automated
manner.
Self-organization mechanisms determine the location of biological structures
both in individual cells and in organisms—thus, they address the where? question.
Structures built according to the genetic blueprint and interacting in speciﬁc ways
may spontaneously generate complexes, associates and as well set of cells which
may then recognize one another through appropriate receptor systems. Examples
of self-organization include spontaneous formation of the cellular membrane from
enzymatically-synthesized phospholipids (which arrange themselves into planar mi-
celles in the presence of water) and the mutual recognition of tissue cells (Figs. 3.22,
3.23, 3.24, 3.25, 3.26, 3.27, and 3.28).

oping embryo, enabling precise distribution of organs and guiding the development

process as a whole. The most frequently applied strategy is to divide the embryo
into speciﬁc parts, each with a different biological “address”, and to apply a sep-
arate control process to each part. Such division occurs in stages and is guided by
sequentially-activated gene packets, according to a predetermined genetic algorithm.
The ability to assign permanent “addresses” to individual components of the or-
ganism is a result of cell differentiation. Following spatial self-orientation of the
embryo (mediated by hox genes), each “address” is targeted for signals which
either promote or inhibit cell proliferation and further specialization, resulting in
development of speciﬁc organs.

Fig. 3.28 Self-organization of a phage with the use of components synthesized by a bacterial cell
This strategy is evident in insect embryos, particularly in the oft-studied fruit ﬂy
(Drosophila melanogaster). It relies on three basic gene packets whose sequential
activation results in structural self-orientation of the embryo and progressive de-
velopment of the organism. These packets are respectively called maternal genes,
segmentation genes and homeotic genes.
The fruit ﬂy egg already exhibits discernible polarity. During development the em-
bryo undergoes further segmentation which clearly deﬁnes points of reference and
enables precise placement of organs. Segmentation can commence once the frontal,
rear, ventral and dorsal areas of the embryo are determined. This process, in turn,
relies on mechanisms activated by the mother inside the egg (this is why the rele-
vant gene packed is called maternal). Following initial self-determination it becomes
possible to delineate boundaries and segments by way of contradictory activity of
cells making up each of the preexisting polar regions. This process is mediated by
hormones (morphogens) or by direct interaction between adjacent cells. The creation
of boundaries is similar to a geopolitical process where two neighboring countries
compete to control as much land as possible, ultimately reaching a detente which
translates into a territorial border. Differentiated boundary cells generate signals
which induce further segmentation. This process continues until a suitable precision
is reached, under the guidance of segmentation genes. Transcription-dependent ex-
pression of these genes results in cell differentiation and determines the ﬁnal purpose
of each segment. Once speciﬁc points of reference (i.e. segment boundaries) are in
place, the development of organs may commence, as speciﬁed by homeotic genes.
To illustrate the need for this strategy, Fig. 3.29 presents how a blind tailor would
go about making a dress. He begins by marking the cloth and then uses these marks
to recreate the structure which exists in his mind.
The aim of the example is to visualize the purpose of natural strategies observed in
embryonic development (note that this example does not fully reﬂect the properties
of biological processes).

Information Entropy and Mechanisms Assisting Selection
According to the second law of thermodynamics, any isolated system tends to ap-
proach its most probable state which is associated with a relative increase in entropy.
Regulatory mechanisms can counteract this process but require a source of infor-
mation. A steady inﬂow of information is therefore essential for any self-organizing
system.

3.4
Information Entropy and Mechanisms Assisting Selection
105
From the viewpoint of information theory, entropy can be described as a mea-
sure of ignorance. Regulatory mechanisms which receive signals characterized by
high degrees of uncertainty, must be able to make informed choices to reduce the
overall entropy of the system they control. This property is usually associated with
development of information channels. Special structures ought to be exposed within
information channels connecting systems of different character as for example link-
ing transcription to translation or enabling transduction of signals through the cellular
membrane. Examples of structures which convey highly entropic information are
receptor systems associated with blood coagulation and immune responses.
The regulatory mechanism which triggers an immune response relies on relatively
simple effectors (complement factor enzymes, phages and killer cells) coupled to a
highly evolved receptor system, represented by speciﬁc antibodies and organized
set of cells. Compared to such advanced receptors the structures which register the
concentration of a given product (e.g. glucose in blood) are rather primitive.
Advanced receptors enable the immune system to recognize and verify infor-
mation characterized by high degrees of uncertainty. The system must be able to
distinguish a speciﬁc antigen among a vast number of structures, each of which may
potentially be treated as a signal.
The larger the set of possibilities, the more difﬁcult it is to make a correct choice—
hence the need for intricate receptor systems. The development and evolution of
such systems increases the likelihood that each input signal will be recognized and
classiﬁed correctly.
In sequential processes it is usually the initial stage which poses the most problems
and requires the most information to complete successfully. It should come as no
surprise that the most advanced control loops are those associated with initial stages
of biological pathways. The issue may be roughly compared to train travel. When
setting out on a journey we may go to the train station at any moment we wish and then
board any train, regardless of its destination. In practice, however, our decision must
take into account the speciﬁc goal of our journey. The number of decisions required
at this preliminary stage is high: we need to decide whether we wish to travel at
all, in which direction, on which train, from which platform and so on. We also
have to make sure that the train waiting at the platform is the one we wish to board.
In systems devoid of sentience such questions must be “posed” by speciﬁc protein
structures, attached to the control loop and usually discarded once their task has been
fulﬁlled. The complexes formed at these initial stages of biological processes are
called initiators. Additional structural elements (usually protein-based) which “pose
questions” through speciﬁc interactions, facilitate correct selections among many
seemingly random possibilities. Figure 3.30 presents an example of the formation
and degradation of initiation complexes in the synthesis of proteins in prokaryotic
cell.

Indirect Storage of Genetic Information
While access to energy sources is not a major problem, sources of information are
usually far more difﬁcult to manage—hence the universal tendency to limit the scope
of direct (genetic) information storage. Reducing the length of genetic code enables
efﬁcient packing and enhances the efﬁciency of operations while at the same time
decreasing the likelihood of errors. A classic example of this trend is the progressive
evolution of alternative splicing of exon fragments. The number of genes identiﬁed
in the human genome is lower than the number of distinct proteins by a factor of 4;
a difference which can be attributed to alternative splicing. Even though the set of
proteins which can be synthesized is comparatively large, genetic information may
still be accessed in a straightforward manner as splicing occurs in the course of
synthesizing ﬁnal mRNA chains from their pre-mRNA precursors. This mechanism

3.5
Indirect Storage of Genetic Information

increases the variety of protein structures without affecting core information storage,
i.e. DNA sequences.
The information expressed as a sequence of aminoacids in the polypeptide chain is
initiallycontainedinthegenome; however, theﬁnalproductofsynthesis—theprotein
itself—may be affected by recombination of exon fragments. Thus, there is no direct
correspondence between synthesized proteins and their genetic representation.
3.5.1
Self-organization as a Means of Exploiting Information
Associated with the Natural Direction of Spontaneous
Processes
Inadditiontoinformationcontaineddirectlyinnucleotidesequences, thecellgenome
also carries “unwritten” rules, rooted in evolutionary experience. Such experience
can be explained as a form of functional optimization, resulting from deletion of
detrimental and deadweight solutions from genetic memory. This mechanism also
applies to information which proves redundant once a simpler solution to a particular
problem has been found.
Evolutionary experience may also free the genome from unnecessary ballast by
exploiting certain mechanisms by which a reaction may draw information from
sources other than the genome itself. This is possible by e.g. exploiting the natural
direction of spontaneous processes. If the lumberjack knows that the sawmill is
located by the river, he does not have to carry a map—he simply needs to follow
the riverbed. A similar situation may occur while sailing: if the intended direction
of travel is consistent with wind direction, all we need to do is set a sail—we do not
require knowledge of paddling or navigation.
Such “unwritten” information is a classic example of natural self-organization at
work. However, it requires a suitable initial programmed structure, synthesized in
accordance with a genetic blueprint.
Self-organization can be likened to stones randomly rolling down a hill and ac-
cumulating at its foot. We can expect that such stones will be mostly round in shape,
as ﬂat or otherwise uneven stones are not as likely to roll. Clearly, roundness is
necessary to exploit the force of gravity as a means of propulsion. Flat stones would
instead need to be carried down the hill (which, of course, requires an additional
source of energy and information).
As mentioned above, biological self-organization is most frequently associated
with protein folding and synthesis of cellular membranes.
The primary structure of the polypeptide chain provides a starting point for the
emergence of higher-order structures. The folding process is spontaneous and is
however, largely irrespective of information stored in the genome. While the genetic
information is present in the aminoacid sequence of the polypeptide chain, folding
does not directly rely on it. In order to fold properly the protein must draw information
from its environment. The primary source of such information is the presence of water
whose molecules assume a speciﬁc structural order in the presence of a hydrophobic
residues of the polypeptide, and then, by spontaneously reverting to their unordered
state, transfer this information back to the polypeptide chain driving its folding.

108

Information—its Role and Meaning in Organisms
In terms of energy ﬂow, polypeptide chain folding is a spontaneous process,
consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. It is assumed that the ﬁnal,
native form of the protein corresponds to an energy minimum of the protein-water
system (see Hypothesis 1.3).
Self-organization of the polypeptide chain is powered primarily by hydrophobic
interactions which may be described as a thermodynamically-conditioned search for
the optimal structure of the chain in the presence of water.
Most researchers believe that only those proteins whose global energy minima
correspond to biological activity pass evolutionary selection and become encoded
in the genome. Consequently, their secondary and tertiary structure may emerge
through spontaneous interaction of the polypeptide chain with its environment.
Although the formation of three-dimensional structures does not directly depend
on nucleotide sequences, the cell may nevertheless employ special proteins called
chaperones, assisting polypeptide chains in ﬁnding their optimal conformation (i.e.
their energy minima). The role of chaperones is to prevent aggregation of partly
folded chains and promote correct packing of chains by restricting their freedom.
They do not directly interfere in folding—instead, their contribution may be treated
as a form of genetic interference to self-organization.
Owing to evolutionary selection of polypeptide chains which ensure spontaneous
synthesis of the required structures in an aqueous environment (corresponding to
active forms of proteins), the genome does not need to directly encode information
related to the extremely complex folding process.
Self-organization may also yield more advanced structures consisting of multiple
proteins—such as ribosomes and other cellular organelles.
Speciﬁc reactivity is revealed by proteins recognizing and binding their speciﬁc
markers thus determining localization also occurs in the context of self-organization,
although its contribution to this process is often limited. It can be observed e.g.
in intercellular interaction where the participating receptors are sometimes called
topological receptors.
3.5.1.1
Formation of Organized Structures as a Means of Reducing the
Necessary Quantity of Information
An organized system is, by deﬁnition, more efﬁcient in exploiting information than an
unorganized system. The emergence of complex structures through self-organization
of genetically-programmed components, resulting in improved operational efﬁ-
ciency, can be explained as a form of utilizing information which is not directly
contained in the genome. Subunits of protein complexes owe their connectivity to
DNA-encoded structural properties, yet their aggregation is a spontaneous process,
independent of any genetic representation. It occurs as a consequence of the struc-
tural afﬁnity of subunits and does not directly translate into any form of code. This
“design concept”, concealed in the structure of subunits, expresses itself via their in-
teractions in protein complexes.Advanced complexes act as biological machines and
are capable of operating with no need for large quantities of information (compared

to individual subunits). Examples of such structures include ribosomes, DNA and
RNA polymerases, proteasomes, chaperonins, etc.
The amount of required information can be further reduced by restricting selected
functions to speciﬁc areas of the cell. An example of this process (also called com-
partmentation) is the delegation of fatty acid degradation processes to mitochondria,
which allows the cell to separate such processes from synthesis of new fatty acid
molecules. Conducting both actions in a shared space would require additional reg-
ulatory mechanisms and therefore additional genetic code. We should also note the
clear division of chromatin present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells allowing sepa-
ration of the splicing process, which appears to play an important role in evolutionary
development. In prokaryotes, translation is intimately coupled to transcription and
genes cannot exist as discrete units (maintaining discrete genes and splicing would
require an unfeasibly large set of additional regulatory mechanisms).
3.5.1.2
Reducing the Need for Genetic Information by Substituting Large
Sets of Random Events for Directed Processes
A stochastic (directionless) system may fulﬁll a speciﬁc task purely through ran-
domization and selection. The likelihood of achieving the required effect increases
in relation to the number of events. Thus, meeting the stated goal (performing a spe-
ciﬁc action) can result from a trial-and-error approach, given a large enough number
of tries. In biological systems, directed processes (requiring information) are fre-
quently replaced by large pools of random actions which can occur with limited
input. This model can be compared to operating a machinegun which ﬁres many
(k) bullets, each with a small but non-negligible probability (p) of hitting the target,
as opposed to launching a single guided missile which has a very high probability
(p = 1.0) of impacting the same target. In the former case, the likelihood of a suc-
cessful hit increases with the number of bullets ﬁred whereas in the latter case it
depends on the quality of electronic guiding systems. The guided missile is highly
efﬁcient (we only need one) but producing and operating it requires a vast quantity
of information. In contrast, the machine gun is a relatively primitive weapon, yet
given a large enough number of tries it also offers a good chance of scoring a hit.
It should therefore be quite natural to employ stochastic strategies in directionless
(i.e. non-sentient) biological systems, where the cost of increasing the number of
attempts is far lower than the cost of obtaining additional information.
If the probability of achieving a hit on each attempt is equal to p and all attempts
are mutually independent, the overall likelihood of hitting the target (P) is expressed
as:
P = 1 −(1 −p)k
where p—probability of hitting the target on any given attempt (probability of the
elementary event); k—number of repetitions (bullets ﬁred). Figure 3.31 shows in-
creases in P as a consequences of more accurate targeting (increased p) and a larger
number of attempts (increased k).

This problem often emerges in interactions between biological systems and their
external environment where the goal is poorly deﬁned (i.e. p is low). Let us consider
the odds that a plant seed will encounter favorable ground in which it can germinate.
Clearly, the dominant biological strategy is to produce a large number of seeds,
increasing the chance that at least one will be successful; however increasing p is
also possible—for example by broadening the dispersal radius with the aid of suitable
biological structures (Fig. 3.32).
Intracellular mechanisms usually involve fewer attempts due to the limited space
in which they operate. One example is the search for target objects, e.g. the interac-
tion between microtubules and chromosomes. Microtubules form a dynamic system
which ﬂuctuates as each individual microtubule grows or shrinks. Their growth de-
pends on the number and activity (by way of forming complexes with GTP) of
tubulin molecules, which exhibit GTPase properties. Given a suitable concentration

of active (GTP-bound) molecules, microtubules are capable of random growth. The
distribution of tubulin is uneven, as newly formed molecules are quickly integrated
into growing chains. Areas characterized by rapid growth of microtubules become
devoid of tubulin, which in turn precludes further growth. Only those microtubules
which ﬁnd their targets (by associating with an external object) gain stability. This
system is capable of sweeping the cell area and, given a large enough number of
steps, locating all chromosomes. We can expect that limiting the search space to the
interior of a cell results in relatively high p and therefore the number of tries (k)
may be lower than in a system which is forced to act in open, unrestricted space
(Fig. 3.33).
Another example of substituting a stochastic process for a directed one is the
formation of antibodies. Since the probability that any single antibody will match
the given antigen (p) is extremely low, the number of randomly generated antibodies
(k) must be correspondingly high.
Antibody differentiation clearly relies on the “large numbers” strategy, assisted
by the “accelerated evolution” mechanism discussed above.
TheV exon of both the light and heavy antibody chain emerges through a recombi-
nation process which resembles building a house from toy blocks. The randomness
of DNA fragments making up each V section, together with the large number of
elements which participate in recombination, provide the resulting antibodies with
random speciﬁcity. Given the great number of synthesized antibodies (high k) it is ex-
ceedingly likely that any given antigen will be recognized by at least some antibodies
(P = 1.0) (Fig. 3.34).
By maintaining an enormous, active receptor (consisting of antibodies and spe-
cialized cells) where the number of different elements is in the 108–1011 range, the
immune system can respond to a great variety of potential threats. However, such a
strategy requires a vast production line, responsible for replacing components and
ensuring constant alertness. This is akin to a burglar who carries a huge bunch of
keys, hoping that at least one of them will match the lock he is trying to open
(Fig. 3.34-Inset).

cation of a systemic principle (increased polarity results in decreased toxicity)
3.5.1.3
Exploiting Systemic Solutions as a Means of Restricting Information
Requirements
This principle corresponds to an adjustable skeleton key which can be used to pick
many locks and therefore replaces a large bunch of individual keys.
Finding a generalized operating principle (by determining commonalities among
a large number of individual mechanisms) is a good way to reduce the need for
directly-encoded information. Such generalizations enable the organism to apply a
single procedure to a wide variety of situations.
One example of this strategy is organic detoxiﬁcation, i.e. transforming toxic
compounds into their polar metabolites which are far less active in the organism and
can easily be excreted. Here, instead of a large number of speciﬁc detoxiﬁcation
processes (as in the case of the immune system, where each antigen has a speciﬁc
associated antibody), a relatively small group of enzymes may effectively detoxify
the organism by applying the common principle of reducing the toxicity of dangerous
compounds by increasing their polarity.
Figure 3.35 presents detoxiﬁcation as applied to aromatic compounds. The enzy-
matic systems integrated in the endoplasmic reticulum conduct oxidation-reduction

processes dominated by monooxygenase activity. Other processes (including hy-
drolysis, deamidination etc.) occur simultaneously, resulting in synthesis of reactive,
polar metabolites which contain R-OH, R-NH2 and R-COOH groups.
At the next stage of the detoxiﬁcation process such groups can readily associate
with other highly polar compounds such as glucuronic acid, sulfate group, taurine
etc., yielding polar, water-soluble derivatives which are easily captured by kidneys
and excreted in urine.
3.6
The Role of Information in Interpreting Pathological Events
Intuitionsuggeststhatcontrolled(regulated)processesfallwithinthedomainofphys-
iology while processes that have escaped control should be considered pathological.
Loss of control may result from an interruption in a regulatory circuit. Thus, informa-
tion is the single most important criterion separating physiological processes from
pathological ones. Diabetes is caused by insulin deﬁciencies (or insulin immunity),
genetic defects may emerge in the absence of certain effector enzymes, neoplasms
occur when cells ignore biological “stop” signals etc.
When discussing immune reactions it should be noted that an exaggerated re-
sponse to certain stimuli may prove just as detrimental as a complete lack of response.
Similar hypersensitivity may also involve e.g. nitric oxide, which can be overpro-
duced by LPS or TNF and cause pathological reactions (Fig. 3.36). Pathological
deﬁciencies sometimes apply to vitamins (which need to be delivered in food) and
other substances which the organism expects to have available as a result of evolu-
tionary conditioning. Finally, instances of poisoning (where the function of enzymes
and other proteins is disrupted) may result from a breakdown of regulatory loops.

The veriﬁcation of the correctness of the research presented above, as well as its

silico (this is a counterpart of the terms in vivo and in vitro which describe research
environments. Following recent progress in computer-based simulations, enabling
scientists to simulate biological processes and structures numerically, the phrase in
silico has been introduced to describe such computerized research. A less popular
equivalent is the term in computro.) Suitable computer programs, reﬂecting the
properties of real-life biological systems, may serve as an important tool for verifying
scientiﬁc hypotheses.

Fig. 3.36 Physiological (controlled) and pathological (uncontrolled) effects of nitric oxide—
efﬁcient regulation as a requirement in physiological processes
The folding of polypeptide chains into their native three-dimensional forms is a
prerequisite of biological activity. The spatial structure of a protein molecule de-
termines its interaction with other molecules: substrates (in the case of enzymes),
ligands (in the case of coenzymes) and prosthetic groups; its structural lability (i.e. in-
herent instability, understood as an effect which facilitates biological function—note
that the structure of the protein is not rigid and may undergo changes) in addition to
any allosteric properties it may exhibit. Under normal conditions polypeptide chain
folding is a directed process which yields a speciﬁc, predetermined structure.
While in silico methods are quite effective in predicting the secondary structure of
a given sequence of amino acids, calculation of tertiary and quaternary structures has
so far proven elusive. We should note that protein folding is not the only area where
computational techniques may be exploited in support of biological research. Equally
important is the ability to determine the function of a given protein by identifying
its ligand binding sites, active sites (in the case of enzymes) or the ability to form
complexes with other proteins.
Simulating three-dimensional structures becomes particularly important in the
context of genomics (computer-aided identiﬁcation of genes), where researchers
attempt to determine the genetic sequences of proteins which have not yet been ex-
perimentally recognized. An effective means of simulating protein structures would
enable us to determine their role in biological systems.

Information—its Role and Meaning in Organisms
Thus far, the biennial Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure
Prediction (CASP) experiment, organized for the 9th time in 2010, has not produced
signiﬁcant progress, despite the involvement of key research centers from around the
world (see http://predictioncenter.org).
Theoretical models assessed within the scope of CASP can be divided into two
groups: Boltzman and Darwinian approaches. The former group assumes that the
polypeptide chain changes its conformation along the energy gradient according to
the so-called thermodynamic hypothesis (which states that protein folding is simply
an ongoing “quest” to reach an energy minimum). The Darwinian approach bases
on evolutionary criteria, claiming that proteins have evolved to attain their observed
structure and function. Thus, Darwinists focus on structural comparisons, especially
those involving homologous proteins (i.e. proteins which share common ancestry).
Research teams which apply the thermodynamic hypothesis seek global optimiza-
tion methods as a means of performing structural assessment. In contrast, scientists
who follow the Darwinian approach query protein databases in search for similar
structures and sequences, trying to determine the evolutionary proximity of various
proteins. If an existing protein is found to be structurally similar to a new aminoacid
sequence (for which only the primary structure is known), the folding properties of
this new sequence can be conﬁdently predicted on the basis of the available template.
The model presented below (as a hypothesis) bases on accurate recreation of the
folding process, contrary to methods which rely on guessing the structure of a given
aminoacid chain. In addition to ﬁnding out the spatial conformation of a known se-
quence of aminoacids, a useful research tool should also propose a generalized model
of the folding process itself, enabling researchers to perform in silico experiments by
interfering with the described mechanism (for example by introducing mutations and
determining their impact on the biological function of the protein). Such techniques
would be particularly useful in drug research where the aim is to design a drug with
speciﬁc properties.
Before presenting the model, however, we ﬁrst need to introduce some general
concepts relating to stages which precede translation.
The foundation of biological systems is the ﬂow of information—from genetic
code to a three-dimensional protein structure, capable of performing a speciﬁc
function:
DNA => RNA => Protein
Or, to be more exact:
DNA => mRNA => AA => 3D => Biological function
AA indicates the primary structure of the protein while 3D stands for its spatial
(three-dimensional) structure.
Numerical (stochastic) analysis of DNA nucleotide sequences enables us to locate
genes, i.e. fragments which are subject to transcription and expression in the form of
mRNA chains. Each mRNA chain corresponds to a sequence of amino acids (AA)
which make up the protein molecule. This sequence, in turn, determines the structural
(3D) form of the protein and therefore its biological function.

3.7
H. HYPOTHESIS
117
While modern in silico sequencing techniques (including gene identiﬁcation) ap-
pear sufﬁciently reliable and the translation process is mostly deterministic (we
known which sequences correspond to each aminoacid), transforming an aminoacid
sequence into a three-dimensional protein structure remains an exceedingly difﬁcult
problem.
Proteins attain their 3D structure through self-organization. From the viewpoint
of energy management, this process conforms to the so-called thermodynamic hy-
pothesis which states that a folding polypeptide chain undergoes structural changes
which lower its potential energy in search for an energy minimum.
In light of the stated requirement for accurate recreation of experimental con-
ditions, we need to consider the fact that folding occurs in steps. The presented
information ﬂow model can be extended with intermediate structural forms:
DNA => mRNA => AA => I1 => I2 => . . . . . . In => 3 −D
=> Biological function
I1–In indicate an arbitrary number of intermediate stages.
We will now discuss a slightly more speciﬁc model which assumes two distinct
intermediate stages called ES (early stage) and LS (late stage):
DNA => mRNA => AA => ES => LS ∼=> 3 D => Biological function
In order to determine how ES and LS are generated, let us consider the ﬁrst stage in
the information pathway. Genetic information is encoded by a four-letter alphabet
where each letter corresponds to a nucleotide. In contrast, the amino acid “alphabet”
consists of 20 separate letters—one for each amino acid.
According to information theory, the quantity of information carried by a single
nucleotide is 2 bits (−log2 (1/4)), whereas the quantity of information needed to
unambiguously select one amino acid from 20 is 4.23 bits (−log2 (1/20)). Clearly,
a single nucleotide cannot encode an amino acid. If we repeat this reasoning for
nucleotide pairs, we will conclude that two nucleotides are still insufﬁcient (they only
carry 4 bits of information—less than the required 4.23 bits). Thus, the minimum
number of nucleotides needed to encode a single amino acid is 3, even though such
a sequence carries more information that is strictly needed (speciﬁcally, 6 bits). This
excess information capacity explains the redundancy of genetic code.
Let us now take this elementary link between probability and the quantity of
information required in the translation process and apply it to subsequent stages in
the information pathway, according to the central dogma of molecular biology.
If the sequence of amino acids unambiguously determines the three-dimensional
structure of the resulting protein, it should contain sufﬁcient information to permit
the folding process to take place.
As already noted, one amino acid carries approximately 4.23 bits of information
(assuming that all amino acids are equally common). How much information must
be provided to describe the conformation of a given amino acid? This property is
determined by deriving the so-called conformer, i.e. the value of two dihedral angles

118

Information—its Role and Meaning in Organisms
which correspond to two degrees of freedom:  (Phi)—the angle of rotation around
the N—Cα bond and  (Psi)—the angle of rotation around the Cα—C’, bond where
N stands for the amine group nitrogen while C’stands for the carbonyl group carbon.
Each angle may theoretically assume values from the −180 to +180 degree range.
The combination of both angles determines the conformation of a given amino acid
within the polypeptide sequence. All such combinations may be plotted on a planar
chart where the vertical (X) axis corresponds to  angles while the horizontal (Y)
axis determines  angles. This chart is called the Ramachandran plot, in honor
of its inventor. It spans the entire conformational space, i.e. it covers all possible
combinations of  and  angles.
Let us now assume that it is satisfactory to measure each angle to an accuracy of 5
degrees. The numberofpossiblecombinationsisequalto(360/5) * (360/5) = 72 * 72.
(Note, however, that −180 and 180 degree angles are in fact equivalent, so we are
in fact dealing with 71 * 71 possible structures.)
Information theory tells us how many bits are required to unambiguously en-
code 71 * 71 possible combinations: we need −log2((1/71)(∗((1/71))) = 12.29 bits.
Thus, from the point of view of information theory, it is impossible to accurately
derive the ﬁnal values of  and  angles starting with a bare amino acid sequence.
However, the presented calculations rely on the incorrect assumption that all amino
acids are equally common in protein structures. In fact, the probability of occurrence
(p) varies from amino acid to amino acid. The Ramachandran plot shows also that
some conformations are preferred while others are excluded due to the speciﬁc nature
of peptide bonds or their association with high-energy states (which, as already ex-
plained, are selected against in the folding process). Column B in Table 3.3 presents
the quantity of information carried by each amino acid given its actual probability
of occurrence in polypeptide chains (these values are derived from a nonredundant
protein base. Columns C and D indicate the expected quantity of information re-
quired to determine the dihedral angles  and  (to an accuracy of 5 or 10 degrees
respectively) for a speciﬁc peptide bond, subject to the probability distribution in the
Ramachandran plot as well as the probability of occurrence of each amino acid (p).
The values presented in Table 3.3 reﬂect entropy which corresponds to the quantity
of information (weighted average over the entire conformational space).
The values presented in column B of Table 3.3 (the quantity of information carried
by each aminoacid and the average quantity of information required to determine its
corresponding  and  angles) suggest that simply knowing a raw amino acid se-
quence does not enable us to accurately model its structure. This is why experimental
research indicates the need for intermediate stages in the folding process.
A basic assumption concerning the early stage (ES) says that the structure of the
polypeptide chain depends solely on its peptide backbone, with no regard for inter-
actions between side chains. In contrast, the late stage (LS) structure is dominated
by interactions between side chains and may also depend on environmental stim-
uli. Most polypeptide chains fold in the presence of water (although they may also
undergo folding in the apolar environment of a cellular membrane).

Explaining the ES structure requires a suitable introduction.
Let us assume that at early stages in the synthesis of polypeptide chains when
interactions between side chains are not yet possible, the conformation of a speciﬁc
chain is strictly determined by mutual orientation of peptide bond planes being the
consequence of the change of dihedral angles  and . This angle (called V-angle)
is expressed as a value from the 0–180 degree range. Given these assumptions,
a helical structure emerges when the values of  and  are close to 0 because
in a helix successive peptide bonds share (roughly) the same direction (treated as
dipoles). In contrast, values close to 180 give rise to a so-called β-sheet structure,
where the peptide bond planes are directed against each other (note that a peptide
bond has polarity and can therefore be assigned a sense akin to a vector). As it turns
out, the relative angle between two neighboring peptide bond planes determines the
curvature radius of the whole polypeptide chain. The helical structure associated with
V ≈0 exhibits a low curvature radius, while the sheet-like structure corresponding
to V ≈180 is characterized by straight lines, with a near-inﬁnite curvature radius.
Intermediate values of V result in structures which are more open than a helix but
not as ﬂat as a sheet. The functional dependency between V and the curvature radius
(Fig. 3.37) for a speciﬁc area of the Ramachandran plot representing low-energy
bonds is depicted in Fig. 3.37.

The approximation function (i.e. the curve which most closely matches an
arbitrary set of points) is given as:
ln (R) = 3.4 × 10−4 × V 2 −2.009 × 10−2 × V + 0.848
(eq.H.1.)
Figure 3.37 depicts the placement of structures which satisfy the above equation
on the Ramachandran plot. It appears that certain conformations are preferred in
peptide bonds and that there exists a preferred conformational space for the entire
peptide backbone (note that the early-stage structure is determined solely by the
arrangement of peptide bond planes). The elliptical path seen in Fig. 3.37 joins all
ordered secondary structures and can be treated as a restricted conformation subspace
for the early stage (ES) form.
The presented interpretation has one more advantage: if we calculate the quantity
of information required to unambiguously select one of the points comprising an
ellipse (columns E, F and G in Table 3.3, for varying degrees of accuracy), we will
note that it corresponds to the quantity of information carried by amino acids (column
B in Table 3.3).
As a consequence, it seems that the raw sequence of amino acids only contains
sufﬁcient information to predict the conformation of the early-stage intermediate
form within the subspace presented in Fig. 3.37.

Regulation in Biological Systems
Maintaining a steady state in thermodynamically open systems
requires regulation.
Abstract Any processes which occur in thermodynamically open systems must be
automatically regulated if they are to maintain a steady state. Note that there is an
important difference between a steady state and a state of equilibrium, since in the
latter case no spontaneity is possible. The need to maintain a steady state ensuring
homeostasis is an essential concern in nature while negative feedback loop is the
fundamental way to ensure that this goal is met. The regulatory system determines
the interdependences between individual cells and the organism, subordinating the
former to the latter. In trying to maintain homeostasis, the organism may temporarily
upset the steady state conditions of its component cells, forcing them to perform
work for the beneﬁt of the organism. Adopting a systemic approach to the study
of regulatory mechanisms explains the mutual dependencies which, taken together,
form the foundation of life.
On a cellular level signals are usually transmitted via changes in concentrations
of reaction substrates and products. This simple mechanism is made possible due to
limited volume of each cell. Such signaling plays a key role in maintaining homeosta-
sis and ensuring cellular activity. On the level of the organism signal transmission is
performed by hormones and the nervous system. This work addresses the problems
of regulation on a systemic level.

Biological entities (cells and organisms) are thermodynamically open systems, which
means that they require regulation to maintain a steady state in conditions of nonequi-
librium. In non-sentient systems regulation must be automatic and based on negative
feedback loops. This principle is universally supported by scientiﬁc evidence. Given
the fact that negative feedback is a precondition of a stable nonequilibrium state
and hence fundamental for living creatures, all biological structures may be treated
as components of negative feedback loops. Such loops can therefore be interpreted
as structural units, representative of speciﬁc biological functions. Interrupting a

feedback loop at any point results in its malfunction or complete loss of function.
Figure 4.1 presents a negative feedback loop with receptor and effector units.
Although the principle of regulation remains unchanged, speciﬁc technical so-
lutions (the structure of receptors, effectors and transmission channels) may differ
depending on the circumstances.
4.1
The Cell and the Organism
Cells and organisms differ with respect to their regulatory strategies. Clearly, the
organism is hierarchically superior to the cell. Its task is to coordinate the function
of specialized cells, protect them from harm and create conditions which promote
homeostasis. The relation between a cell and an organism is similar to the citizen-
state model. Its hierarchical aspects are quite real and reﬂected in the structure and
function of both entities.
Each living cell is an independent biological unit (with its own source of power),
capable of maintaining its internal processes in a steady state through automatic
regulation based on negative feedback loops.
Most intracellular signal pathways work by altering the concentrations of selected
substances inside the cell. Signals are registered by forming reversible complexes
consisting of a ligand (reaction product) and an allosteric receptor complex. When
coupled to the ligand, the receptor inhibits the activity of its corresponding effector,
which in turn shuts down the production of the controlled substance ensuring the
steady state of the system.
Signals coming from outside the cell are usually treated as commands (covalent
modiﬁcations), forcing the cell to adjust its internal processes and enter a new level
of steady state. Although both types of signals (intracellular and extracellular ones)
belong to negative feedback loops, they differ with respects to the mechanisms they
employ.

the nucleus). B Through gene expression (altering the quantity of proteins—the signal passes
through the nucleus). C Through cell proliferation (both A and B)
Cells are automatic systems, devoid of decision centers. Thus, they are incapable
of commanding themselves and can only respond to some external commands. Such
commands can arrive in the form of hormones, produced by the organism to coordi-
nate specialized cell functions in support of general homeostasis (in the organism).
These signals act upon cell receptors and are usually ampliﬁed before they reach
their ﬁnal destination (the effector). Proper functioning of regulatory pathways in
cells playing a role of the effector for the organism can be ensured in two ways:
1. In a non-dividing cell by:
A. activation or inhibition of existing proteins (mostly enzymes) without altering
their concentrations,
B. synthesis or degradation of proteins;
2. Through cell proliferation and expression of their biological functions (Fig. 4.2)
Although many regulatory phenomena have not yet been sufﬁciently studied, current
scientiﬁc knowledge enables us to formulate some generalizations.
4.2
The Principle and Mechanism of Automatic Intracellular
Regulation
Basic intracellular signals are expressed through changes in concentrations of re-
action substrates and products. This basic the simplest form of signalling remains
effective so long as the signal does not undergo a signiﬁcant dilution. By reacting to its
own product, a synthesis process may upregulate or downregulate itself, maintaining
the genetically-programmed concentration of the substance it synthesizes.
The role of negative feedback loop is to stabilize processes whose products are
recognized by their own detection subsystems, downregulating the activity of ef-
fectors. Automatic control of all internal processes makes the cell an autonomous
entity.

Regulation in Biological Systems
4.2.1
Cellular Receptors
Each concentration-mediated signal must ﬁrst be registered by a detector. Once
activated, the detector issues another signal, triggering a process which counteracts
the observed change. Intracellular detectors are typically based on allosteric proteins.
Allosteric proteins exhibit a special property: they have two stable structural
conformations and can shift from one form to the other as a result of changes in
ligand concentrations. Examples of such proteins include regulatory enzymes which
play a key role in regulating intracellular metabolic pathways. They enable speciﬁc
binding of reaction products (acting as receptors) but they also exhibit effector-like
properties. Most intracellular allosteric enzymes are linked to regulatory functions.
Both types of activity (receptor and effector) are interlinked via allosteric effects.
Some regulatory tasks can only be fulﬁlled by protein complexes due to the fact
that the energy cost associated with reconﬁguration of subunits is relatively low and
can be covered by forming a reversible bond with the ligand. On the other hand, the
protein-ligand interaction must result in signiﬁcant structural rearrangement of the
complex, precipitating a signiﬁcant change in its activity in spite of the relatively
low energy associated with such interactions. The allosteric properties of regulatory
proteinsenableweakly-interactingligandstoeffectivelycontrolbiologicalprocesses.
Their function may be compared to that of converters in electrical circuits, where
relatively low currents regulate the action of powerful effector devices.
Allosteric effects are not equivalent to regulatory systems: they merely enable pro-
teins to adapt to changing conditions by undergoing structural rearrangement, result-
ing in increased or decreased activity; they do not, however, stabilize reactions. This
is why allosteric modiﬁcations (e.g. in the structure of hemoglobin, which compen-
sates for changes in the availability of oxygen) should be counted among adaptation
mechanisms. Allosteric proteins enhance or support regulatory loops but do not re-
place them. (An exception should be made for certain autonomous proteins which act
as receptors as well as effectors, implementing all elements of a regulatory loop—for
instance hexokinase in muscle; see Fig. 4.3. The product of hexokinase—glucose-
6-phosphate—is also its inhibitor, responsible for stabilizing the synthesis process).
Subunits of regulatory enzymes playing a role of intracellular detectors may be ei-
ther identical or dissimilar. Subunits which react with the product of a given reaction
and perform adjustments by way of allosteric effects are called regulatory subunits
while those directly involved in biological functions are known as functional subunits
(or catalytic subunits in the case of enzymes; see Fig. 4.4). If the subunits of an al-
losteric protein are identical to one another, they may perform receptor and catalytic
functions at the same time using different active sites for each function (cumulative
feedback inhibition). A classic example is bacterial glutamine synthetase. This en-
zyme consists of identical subunits (12) which are capable of reacting with various
ligands, adjusting the productivity of the entire complex. In general the structure of
allosteric proteins must enable changes in activity caused by reversible interaction
with their own products, or with the products of other coordinating processes.

The concentration of a product (or substrate) which triggers structural realignment

centration (Fig. 4.5). In other words, high concentration of the product is necessary
to trigger a low-afﬁnity receptor (and vice versa).
Most intracellular regulatory mechanisms rely on noncovalent interactions. Co-
valent bonding is usually associated with extracellular signals, generated by the
organism and capable of overriding the cell’s own regulatory mechanisms by mod-
ifying the sensitivity of receptors (Fig. 4.5-right). Noncovalent interactions may be
compared to requests while covalent signals are treated as commands.
Signals which do not originate in the receptor’s own feedback loop but modify
its afﬁnity are known as steering signals (Fig. 4.6). A controlled regulatory system
resembles a servomechanism (i.e. an autonomous, self-regulating mechanical device
whose action is subject to external commands). Steering signals play an important
role in coordinating biological processes.
Receptor afﬁnity may change as a result of external commands.
According to this deﬁnition, intracellular coordinating signals may be described
as steering signals; however their interaction with the receptor is noncovalent, unlike
the action of signals coming from the organism (the issue of coordination will be
discussed in a separate chapter).
Noncovalent interactions—dependent on substance concentrations—impose spa-
tial restrictions on regulatory mechanisms. Any increase in cell volume requires
synthesis of additional products in order to maintain stable concentrations. The vol-
ume of a spherical cell is given as V = 4/3 π ∗r3, where r indicates cell radius.
Clearly, even a slight increase in r translates into a signiﬁcant increase in cell volume,

diluting any products dispersed in the cytoplasm. This implies that cells cannot ex-
pand without incurring great energy costs. It should also be noted that cell expansion
reduces the efﬁciency of intracellular regulatory mechanisms because signals and
substrates need to be transported over longer distances. Thus, cells are universally
small, regardless of whether they make up a mouse or an elephant.
4.2.2
Cellular Effectors
An effector is an element of a regulatory loop which counteracts changes in the
regulated quantity.
Cellular effectors usually assume the form of feedback-controlled degradation
and synthesis. In both cases the concentration of the regulated product is subject to
automatic stabilization and control. From the point of view of the entire organism,
each cell can be treated as a separate effector.
Synthesis and degradation of biological compounds often involves numerous en-
zymes acting in sequence. The product of one enzyme is a substrate for another
enzyme. With the exception of the initial enzyme, each step of this cascade is con-
trolled by the availability of the supplied substrate and does not require allosteric
structure (Fig. 4.7).
The effector consists of a chain of enzymes, each of which depends on the activity
of the initial regulatory enzyme (aspartate transcarbomylase—ATCase) as well as
on the activity of its immediate predecessor which supplies it with substrates.
The function of all enzymes in the effector chain is indirectly dependent on the
initial enzyme, allosterically linked to a receptor subsystem. This coupling between
the receptor and the ﬁrst link in the effector chain is a universal phenomenon. It can
therefore be said that the initial enzyme in the effector chain is, in fact, a regula-
tory enzyme. (Note that by “initial enzyme” we mean the enzyme whose product
unambiguously triggers a speciﬁc chain of reactions.)

The product of the effector chain (or its functional derivatives) forms reversible
complexes with the regulatory enzyme, controlling the production process, and
through it—the function of the effector itself. By binding its assigned product, the
regulatory enzyme acts as an intracellular receptor in addition to catalyzing the
reaction.
Most cell functions depend on enzymatic activity. Even nonenzymatic processes
(e.g. the action of motor proteins) are indirectly mediated by enzymes. It seems that a
set of enzymes associated with a speciﬁc process which involves a negative feedback
loop is the most typical form of an intracellular regulatory effector. Such effectors
can be controlled through activation or inhibition of their associated enzymes.
A typical eukaryotic cell is, however, largely incapable of affecting enzymes in
the way other than by synthesizing their activators or inhibitors. Due to the fact that
organisms actively strive to maintain internal homeostasis, enzymatic control in cells
cannot be enforced through changes in temperature, pH or substance concentrations.

Fig. 4.8 The bacterial operon—a negative (self-regulated) feedback loop with transcription and
translation as its basic effector mechanisms
Instead, regulation rests upon the interaction between controlled effector enzymes
and the receptors. The dynamics of metabolic pathways depend on the concentrations
of their own products and substrates (regulation) as well as on the products of other
reactions for coordination (steering).
Certain processes involve a somewhat different enzymatic effector control mecha-
nismwhichexploitschangesintheconcentrationofactiveenzymesthroughregulated
synthesis of proteins (gene expression). A negative feedback loop which alters the
concentrations of proteins (or their products) in order to control effectors was ﬁrst
described by F. Jacob and J. Monod, who studied the so-called lactose operon in
E. coli bacteria (Fig. 4.8). This operon includes a receptor called a repressor (or,
more speciﬁcally, its detection subunit). The repressor binds its assigned product (or
substrate) and undergoes allosteric realignment which causes it to gain (or lose) the
ability to attach to the operator subunit, thereby activating (or inhibiting) the function
of polymerase. In this way the effector may be inactivated once the concentration
of the product exceeds a genetically-determined level, thus preventing excessive
accumulation of products. Similar modulation of transcription is also observed in
eukaryotic organisms, although in this case it must occur simultaneously in many ar-
eas of the genome, as the encoded information concerning the given activity is often
partitioned into different chromosomes. Instead of repressors, eukaryotes employ
so-called transcription factors—having special structural matrices (zinc ﬁngers or
leucine zippers) capable of attaching to DNA strands in response to external signals.
Receptor activity is exhibited by regulatory subunits which react with the product
(called an inductor) and allosterically modify its ability to bind to DNA.
Transcription activation processes have been extensively studied; however most
of these studies involve extracellular signals, i.e. signals generated by the organ-
ism. Transduction of such signals is ensured by membrane receptors and other
speciﬁc transduction factors (such as G proteins). It is not clear, however, how
the cell regulates transcription for its own purposes. The simplest model seems to

134

Regulation in Biological Systems
be an operon-like construct where the protein product (e.g. enzyme) directly inter-
acts with the transcription factor, upregulating or downregulating transcription as
required. Nevertheless, our knowledge of this mechanism is not yet sufﬁcient to
attempt generalizations.
Another related model involves partial or complete appropriation of the own in-
tracellular machinery for interpreting hormonal signals sent by the organism. This
is realized by auto- or paracrine signaling (see Figs. 4.17).
4.3
Regulatory Coupling Between Cells and
Organisms—Hierarchical Properties of Regulation
Automatic regulation enables cells to act as autonomous units, which means that—in
given suitable environmental conditions—cells may survive on their own. In an or-
ganism, however, the autonomy of individual cells is severely restricted. The relation
between the cell and the organism is hierarchical and although the organism only
controls speciﬁc areas of the cell’s activity, its demands cannot be met without the
aid of basic intracellular processes.
A question arises: how can an involuntary automatic system (i.e. the cell) integrate
with the organism’s own regulatory mechanisms? This issue can be better explained
by comparing the cell to a simple automaton—namely, a refrigerator. The refriger-
ator includes an automatically-controlled thermostat, based on a negative feedback
loop with a temperature sensor coupled to a heat pump. Like most automatons, it
is an autonomous system, capable of stabilizing its own internal temperature. How-
ever, most refrigerators also permit external control by an operator who may change
the desired temperature. Operator intervention occurs by way of interacting with a
separate panel (receptor) which registers and interprets steering signals.
Assuming that the stabilization curve for negative feedback loops is sinusoid-
shaped, the effect of control is similar to that depicted in Fig. 4.9. A good biological
exampleisfever, wherebacterialtoxinsactuponorganictemperaturereceptorswhich
in turn modulate body temperature. Once the bacteria are cleared from the organism,
the temperature stabilization loop reverts to its original parameters. Such changes in
receptor sensitivity are perceived as a cold or heat sensation which persists until the
desired temperature is reached.
While refrigerator settings can be modiﬁed at will, signals issued by the organ-
ism are themselves products of other, hierarchically superior regulatory loops which
control the functions of the organism as a whole. This mechanism is depicted in
Fig. 4.10. Hormones which act upon cells are, by their nature, steering signals: they
enforce the superiority of the organism in relation to individual cells. The stabiliza-
tion loop of a homeostatic parameter becomes a source of control if its signals are
capable of affecting cellular receptors by altering their structure or introducing other
permanent changes (such as the formation of complexes). This effect can be attained
e.g. by covalent modiﬁcation of receptor units.
This schematic relation is an expression of the cell—organism hierarchy.

A well-studied example of the presented mechanism involves regulation of blood
glucose levels through degradation and synthesis of glycogen in hepatic cells. In
this case an intracellular regulatory loop maintains the desired low concentration
of glucose inside the cell (as indicated by glucose-6-phosphate). Glucose can be
obtained from glycogen in the course of phosphorolysis, which is dependent on the
concentration ofATP. Signals generated by a hierarchically superior control loop may
force the cell to intensify its metabolism by altering the sensitivity of an allosteric
enzyme—glycogen phosphorylase. Covalent (hormonally induced phosphorylation)
modiﬁcations to this enzyme increase its tolerance to the product it controls (see
Fig. 4.11).

Hormonal modiﬁcation signiﬁcantly reduces the afﬁnity of the receptor to
glucose-6-phosphate. As a result, the concentration of glucose-6-phosphate (and,
consequently, of glucose in the cell) increases. Excess glucose is expelled into the
bloodstream where it can compensate for the deﬁciency which triggered the initial
hormonal steering signal.
In summary, regulatory loops of the organism rely on the effector activity of
individual cells through 1. modifying the activity of speciﬁc intracellular proteins;
2. degradation or synthesis of proteins connected with the given activity; 3. cell
proliferationorprogrammedcelldeath. Hormone-inducedactivity, althoughspeciﬁc,
affects also the entire biological machinery of the cell.
4.4
Regulatory Mechanisms on the Organism Level
The organism is a self-contained unit represented by automatic regulatory loops
which ensure homeostasis. Its program is expressed in the structure of its receptors.
Effector functions are conducted by cells which are usually grouped and organized
into tissues and organs. Signal transmission occurs by way of body ﬂuids, hormones
or nerve connections. Cells can be treated as automatic and potentially autonomous

elements of regulatory loops, however their speciﬁc action is dependent on the com-
mands issued by the organism. This coercive property of organic signals is an integral
requirement of coordination, allowing the organism to maintain internal homeostasis.
Coercive action can be achieved through 1. signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation of signals
issued by the organism to its effector cells; 2. covalent nature of modiﬁcations
triggered by organic signals; 3. a possible slow degradation of organic signals which
have reached the cell. The effects of these mechanisms can be compared to an army
drill, where the instructor enforces obedience by persistently shouting orders.
Activities of the organism are themselves regulated by their own negative feedback
loops. Such regulation differs however from the mechanisms observed in individual
cells due to its place in the overall hierarchy and differences in signal properties,
including in particular:
•
Signiﬁcantly longer travel distances (compared to intracellular signals);
•
The need to maintain hierarchical superiority of the organism;
•
The relative autonomy of effector cells.
In order to remain effective, the signal coming from the organism must be ampliﬁed
and encoded; since they are becoming highly diluted.
It is also necessary to provide signal deactivation mechanisms which can shield
effectors from undue stress caused by the outliving hierarchical signal (note that the
effectors in organism’s regulatory pathways are living cells which require protection).
Most signals originated on organism’s level travel with body ﬂuids; however if a
signal has to reach its destination very rapidly (for instance in muscle control) it is
sent via the nervous system and becomes only humoral at entering the cell.
As mentioned above, signals coming from organism act upon regulatory of spe-
cialised cells which control development and/or homeostasis. Responding to such
signals and fulﬁlling the requested tasks requires however the cell to adjust its internal
metabolism.
4.4.1
Signal Encoding
The relatively long distance travelled by organism’s signals and their dilution (com-
pared to intracellular ones) calls for ampliﬁcation. As a consequence, any errors or
random distortions in the original signal may be drastically exacerbated.
A solution to this problem comes in the form of encoding, which provides the
signal with sufﬁcient speciﬁcity while enabling it to be selectively ampliﬁed. This
situation can be compared to talking over a shortwave radio. When engaged in a
normal conversation, we are usually facing our interlocutor who can hear us clearly,
despite any ambient noise. In order to communicate over longer distances, we need to
use a radio transceiver which encodes our voice as an electromagnetic wave (unlike
acoustic waves, electromagnetic signals are unaffected by ambient noise). Once
received and ampliﬁed by the receiver, the signal may be heard by the other party.

Note that a loudspeaker can also assist in acoustic communication, but due to the
lack of signal encoding it cannot compete with radios in terms of communication
distance.
The same reasoning applies to organism-originated signals, which is why infor-
mation regarding blood glucose levels is not conveyed directly by glucose but instead
by adrenalin, glucagon or insulin.
Information encoding is handled by receptors and hormone-producing cells. Tar-
get cells are capable of decoding such signals, thus completing the regulatory loop
(Fig. 4.12).
Hormonal signals may be effectively ampliﬁed because the hormone itself does
not directly participate in the reaction it controls—rather, it serves as an information
carrier. If blood glucose concentration was to manifest itself purely through changes
in glucose levels (without hormonal action) local distortions and random effects
would—following intracellular ampliﬁcation—interfere with correct interpretation
of the input signal. Thus, strong ampliﬁcation invariably requires encoding in order
to render the signal sufﬁciently speciﬁc and unambiguous.
The above mechanism is ubiquitous in nature. An interesting example is the
E. coli lactose operon, exploiting as an inducer allolactose which is attuned as tiny
component to lactose instead of the somewhat more expected lactose itself (the
proper substrate). Registering an increase in the concentration of allolactose serves
as direct evidence that lactose levels have also increased. As a consequence, the
operon activates gene expression for additional enzymes, adjusting the cell’s energy
management mechanisms.
Allolactose has the properties of an encoded signal. If the receptor were to react
directly to lactose, it would have to cope with the relative abundance of this substance
by lowering its own sensitivity—this, however, would also decrease its speciﬁcity
and increase the probability of errors.

4.4.2
Signal Ampliﬁcation
As mentioned above, one of the key differences between intracellular and organism-
originated signals is the distance each has to travel. Long-distance communication
and dilution of signals introduces the need for signal ampliﬁcation.
An important subgroup of regulatory components involved in organism-originated
homeostasis processes is represented by ampliﬁers. Unlike organisms, cells usually
do not require ampliﬁcation in their internal regulatory loops—even the somewhat
rare instances of intracellular ampliﬁcation only increase signal levels by a small
amount.
Without the aid of an ampliﬁer, messengers coming from the organism level would
need to be highly concentrated at their source, which would result in decreased
efﬁciency as all such molecules need to be synthesized ﬁrst (and then degraded once
the signal has served its purpose). The need for signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation is also tied to
the speciﬁc properties of organism-originated signals which must override the cell’s
own regulatory mechanisms.
Two types of ampliﬁers are observed in biological systems:
1. cascade ampliﬁer,
2. positive feedback loop.
4.4.3
Cascade Ampliﬁer
A cascade ampliﬁer is usually a collection of enzymes which perform their action
by activation in strict sequence. This mechanism resembles multistage (sequential)
synthesis or degradation processes, however instead of exchanging reaction products,
ampliﬁer enzymes communicate by sharing activators or by directly activating one
another. Cascade ampliﬁers are usually contained within cells. They often consist of
kinases. A classic example is the adenylate cyclase cascade in the glucagon synthesis
pathway (response to decreased blood glucose levels), whose individual stages are
invoked through phosphorylation (Fig. 4.13). Activation of ampliﬁer stages may
also occur by way of protease or esterase interaction, release of calcium ions etc.
(Fig. 4.14). Figure 4.15 presents the ampliﬁcation of the growth factor signalling.
Ampliﬁcation is also involved in gene expression as each stage ampliﬁes information
via repeated transcription and reuse of transcripts as well as the resulting proteins
(Fig. 4.16).
The effector cell regenerates the ampliﬁer by synthesizing its substrates (such as
ATP). Ampliﬁcation effects occurring at each stage of the cascade contribute to its
ﬁnal result. In the case of adenyl cyclase, the ampliﬁed hormone allows for synthesis
of approximately 104 cyclicAMP molecules before it is inactivated. While the kinase
ampliﬁcation factor is estimated to be on the order of 103, the phosphorylase cascade

that the hormones involved in this cascade produce particularly powerful effects.
Due to their low volume, cells usually have no need for signal ampliﬁcation. Even
so, ampliﬁcation may play a certain role in special cases, such as autocrine signaling,
where a signal produced by the cell returns to it and is recognized by a receptor. This

Positive feedback loop
Apositivefeedbackloopissomewhatanalogoustoanegativefeedbackloop, however
in this case the input and output signals work in the same direction—the receptor
upregulates the process instead of inhibiting it. Such upregulation persists until the
available resources are exhausted.
Positive feedback loops can only work in the presence of a control mechanism
which prevents them from spiraling out of control. They cannot be considered self-
contained and only play a supportive role in regulation. The effects of an uncontrolled
feedback loop can be easily observed by attaching a loudspeaker to a microphone
and placing both of them close together. Any sound registered by the microphone
is ampliﬁed and transmitted over the loudspeaker, further increasing the input vol-
ume and causing a runaway feedback reaction which manifests itself as the familiar
screeching noise.
In biological systems positive feedback loops are sometimes encountered in ex-
tracellular regulatory processes where there is a need to activate slowly-migrating

components and greatly amplify their action in a short amount of time. Examples
include blood coagulation and complement factor activation (Figs. 4.18 and 4.19).
Positive feedback loops may play a role in binary control systems which follow
the “all or nothing” principle. Due to its auto-catalytic character the positive feedback
loop is used for construction of binary switching mechanisms and governing cell fate
decisions.
Positive feedback loops are often coupled to negative loop-based control mecha-
nisms. Such interplay of loops may impart the signal with desirable properties, for
instance by transforming a ﬂat signals into a sharp spike required to overcome the
activation threshold for the next stage in a signalling cascade. An example is the
ejection of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum in the phospholipase C cas-
cade, itself subject to a negative feedback loop. Positive feedback is also observed
in the activation of cyclins.
Feedback-based ampliﬁcation of weak signals may also double as intracellular
memory. It is believed that the high rate of activation and deactivation of signals in
nerve cells relies on positive feedback mechanisms.
4.4.5
Signal Attenuation
Strong signal ampliﬁcation carries an important drawback: it tends to “overshoot”
its target activity level, causing wild ﬂuctuations in the process it controls. While
sinusoid ﬂuctuations are a natural property of stabilized processes, high amplitudes

are usually considered undesirable even if average values remain in agreement with
biological programming (Fig. 4.20). Signiﬁcant deviations from the norm, though
temporary, may have a negative impact on biological systems.
The danger associated with strong ﬂuctuations is particularly evident in organism-
originated regulatory loops. Nature has evolved several means of signal attenuation.
The most typical mechanism superimposes two regulatory loops which affect the
same parameter but act in opposite directions. An example is the stabilization of
blood glucose levels by two contradictory hormones: glucagon and insulin. Simi-
lar strategies are exploited in body temperature control and many other biological
processes.
Each cellular receptor acts upon a single type of effector: its input signal can
only work in one speciﬁc direction, for instance by activating the synthesis of some
product or counteracting a decrease in its concentration. A single receptor cannot

issue contradictory signals, simultaneously upregulating and downregulating a pro-
cess (Fig. 4.21). This limitation usually does not hamper intracellular machinery due
to the limited space in which reaction components are contained and the efﬁciency
with which they can be processed. However, signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations may be observed
in certain slow-acting processes such as gene expression where the persistence of
mRNA may sometimes induce overexpression. Maintaining the programmed level
of activity, free of undue ﬂuctuations, requires proper degradation and removal of
intermediate products.
The attenuation mechanism involved in the action of the bacterial operon has
been well studied. It is able to recognize the concentration of the product prior to
transcription necessary for its synthesis and prevent its excessive buildup as a result
of recycling transcripts.
4.4.6
Signal Inactivation
The coercive properties of signals coming from the organism carry risks associated
with the possibility of overloading cells. The regulatory loop of an autonomous cell
must therefore include an “off switch”, controlled by the cell.
An autonomous cell may protect itself against excessive involvement in processes
triggered by external signals (which usually incur signiﬁcant energy expenses). Once
acknowledged, hormones must be quickly inactivated.
It is natural to expect that the inactivation mechanism will be found along the
signal pathway (before the position of ampliﬁer). The action of such mechanisms is
usually timer-based, meaning that they inactivate signals following a set amount of
time. A classic example of an inactivator is found in protein G (see Figs. 4.13 and
4.14). This protein is activated by hormonal signals, but immediately upon activation
it also triggers the corresponding inactivation process. Protein G activation occurs

determines the duration of the signal. A similar property is observed in Ras proteins,
where GTPase activity of the initiation complex eventually interrupts the signal
(Fig. 4.22). We should also note the association between receptor phosphorylation
and phosphatase activity in many other processes.

Although all proteins which undergo phosphorylation eventually revert to their
initial state via phosphatase activity, the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation effects
are particularly pronounced at the entry point of the amplifying cascade which should
therefore be considered the proper inactivation place. Signal inactivation may also
occur as a result of receptor pinocytosis (Fig. 4.23). The ability to interrupt signals

Gray circles represent antigens while lines represent surface receptors
protects cells from exhaustion. Uncontrolled hormone-induced activity may have
detrimental effects upon the organism as a whole. This is observed e.g. in the case of
the vibrio cholerae toxin which causes prolonged activation of intestinal epithelial
cells by locking protein G in its active state (resulting in severe diarrhea which can de-
hydrate the organism). Similar disregulation is associated with the prolonged action
of acetylcholine resulting from inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by phosphoorganic
compounds.
4.4.7
Discrimination
Biological systems in which information transfer is affected by high entropy of the
information source and ambiguity of the signal itself must include discriminatory
mechanisms. These mechanisms usually work by eliminating weak signals (which
are less speciﬁc and therefore introduce ambiguities). They create additional obsta-
cles (thresholds) which the signals must overcome.A good example is the mechanism
which eliminates the ability of weak, random antigens to activate lymphatic cells. It
works by inhibiting blastic transformation of lymphocytes until a so-called receptor
cap has accumulated on the surface of the cell (Fig. 4.24). Only under such condi-
tions can the activation signal ultimately reach the cell nucleus (likely overriding the
phosphatase activity) and initiate gene transcription. Aggregation of immunoglob-
ulin receptors on the membrane surface is a result of interaction with the antigen;
however weak, reversible nonspeciﬁc interactions do not permit sufﬁcient aggrega-
tion to take place. This phenomenon can be described as a form of discrimination
against weak signals.
In addition to antigen recognition and effector activity of individual immunoglob-
ulins, another activation threshold exists in the complement factor activation cascade,
which requires a suitable aggregation of antibodies. Discrimination is effected by a

special T lymphocyte receptor which consists of many independent subunits, each

Discrimination may also be linked to effector activity. One example is the re-
stricted propagation of blood clots beyond the speciﬁc site of vessel damage. Blood
coagulation automatically triggers ﬁbrinolysis, which counteracts further clotting by
degrading ﬁbrin molecules (Fig. 4.26).
4.4.8
Coordinating Signals on the Organism Level
Mindful of the hierarchical relation between the cell and the organism we can assume
that hormones act by coordinating the function of cells in order to ensure homeostasis.
Hormonal signals supersede intracellular regulatory mechanisms and subordinate
the needs of cells to those of the organism as a whole. This hierarchical structure
is further reinforced by signal ampliﬁcation and covalent modiﬁcation of signal
mediators within the cell.
According to the presented criteria, hormones follow a speciﬁc plan of action,
roughly outlined in Fig. 4.27, which presents several transduction pathways. It also
depicts some atypical means of signalling—for instance nitric oxide, which acts as
a hormone even though it is not associated with any speciﬁc membrane receptor. A
signal may be treated as a hormone regardless of its source, as long as it originates
outsidethecellandaffectsintracellularmachinery. Hormonalcontrolmaybeeffected
over long distances (via the bloodstream) or short distances, when the signal comes
from adjacent cells (e.g. growth factors or morphogens). Nitric oxide permeates the
cellular membrane and activates the guanyl cyclase cascade. The speciﬁcity of this
unusual hormone is probably a result of the proximity of its source to the effector
mechanism as well as its rapid rate of its degradation.

Another atypical means of signaling is observed in steroids, whose receptors are
located inside the cell and—once activated—can perform the role of transcription
modulators. The coercive nature of steroids is supported by their persistent action
inside the cell (compared to hormones which only interact with surface receptors)
as well as their high afﬁnity to receptors (equilibrium constant in the 109 range).
It should also be noted that biological processes induced by steroids are usually
slow-paced and therefore do not require strong ampliﬁcation. Hormonal signaling is
itself a relatively slow process—signals which need to reach their destination very
rapidly (for instance signals controlling muscle contractions) are usually transmitted
via nerve connections.
As mentioned above, if the organism is to coordinate the action of various tissues,
its signals must override the autonomous regulatory mechanisms of individual cells.

Extracellular Process Control
Most enzymes reside inside cells, acting as effectors in intracellular pathways. There
are, however, processes which require cells to release enzymes into the extracellu-
lar space. These include food metabolism, blood coagulation, complement factor

activation and some tissue-related mechanisms. Under such circumstances the cell
effectively looses control of the given process. While enzymatic activity can be
easily regulated inside the cell (for instance by automatic controlling the concentra-
tion of its product), external processes admit no such regulation and can potentially
prove dangerous (this applies to e.g. proteolytic enzymes). Occasionally, enzymes
may enter the outer cell space as a result of cell degradation or diffusion from the
gastrointestinal tract.
Inadvertent (but manageable) enzyme “leaks” are dealt with by specialized natural
inhibitors called serpins which exist in the bloodstream speciﬁcally for that purpose.
Proper regulation only applies to enzymes secreted by cells in programmed biological
processes. As a general rule, such enzymes are released in their inactive state. They
can be activated by a speciﬁc signal once the organism has taken steps to protect
itself from uncontrolled proliferation of active forms.

pathway. Gray belts show the activity of cyclins A to E
Activation of gastrointestinal enzymes is therefore coupled to processes which
protect the intestinal wall from being attacked. In blood coagulation, enzymatic
activity is tightly linked to the developing clot, while in the complement factor
activation cascade degradation processes are limited to antigen-antibody complexes
present on the surface of the antigen cell. The principle of production and secretion
of inactive enzymes is evident in extracellular mechanisms where controlling such
enzymes may be difﬁcult; however it can also be observed in certain intracellular
pathways where some enzymes are activated ab initio to fulﬁll speciﬁc tasks. This
situation occurs e.g. in kinases (activated through phosphorylation) or in proteolytic
enzymes (especially caspases) tightly connected with apoptosis.
4.4.10
Cell Population Control
Basic cell population control mechanisms include proliferation by division (mitosis)
and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Both processes must be controlled by extra-
cellular signals because they produce important effects for the organism as a whole.
Cell division is governed by the so-called growth factors. Once triggered,
the division process may proceed autonomously, progressing through successive
checkpoints of the mitosis program (Fig. 4.28).

154

Regulation in Biological Systems
If the process consists of several stages, control must be sequential, i.e. each
stage starts with a checkpoint which tests whether the previous stage has completed
successfully.
Cell division requires the entire genome to be copied, which involves not just DNA
replication but also synthesis of additional DNA-binding proteins. This so-called S
phase comes at a tremendous cost to the cell’s resources. It is followed by the G2
phase, which prepares the cell for actual division (itself occurring in the M phase).
All processes associated with division are subject to strict control. Each stage must
fully complete before the next stage is triggered.
Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (mediated by kinases and phosphatases)
appear to effect control over the mitosis process. However, each phase of mitosis is
ushered in by special proteins called cyclins. These are synthesized in parallel with
other division-related structures and broken down shortly thereafter.
The cell may maintain a stationary state (G0 phase) for a long time. Entering
the G1 phase signals readiness for division, however the transition from G0 to G1
is reversible. Cells protect themselves against accidental division by raising the
activation threshold. This mechanism is mediated by a protein known as p53, which
can also inhibit division in later phases, should irregularities occur.
Cell division is counterbalanced by programmed cell death. The most typical
example of this process is apoptosis (Fig. 4.29). Apoptosis occurs as a result of
proapoptotic signals (such as the tumor necrosis factor TNFα) which pierce the mi-
tochondrial membrane and release the contents of mitochondria into the cytoplasm.
Once released, mitochondrial cytochrome C activates speciﬁc apoptotic enzymes
called caspases, which proceed to degrade cell organelles and effectively kill the
cell.
Each cell is prepared to undergo controlled death if required by the organism,
however apoptosis is subject to tight control. Cells protect themselves against acci-
dental triggering of the process via IAP proteins. Only strong proapoptotic signals
may overcome this threshold and initiate cellular suicide (Fig. 4.29).
Supervision of both processes—cell division and death—enables the organism to
maintain a controlled population of cells (Fig. 4.30).
4.5
Development Control
Biological regulation relies on the assumption that processes can be automatically
controlled via negative feedback loops. Such regulation appears useful both for the
organism and for individual, mature cells which strive to maintain a steady state.
However, it cannot be readily applied to development control where the goal is
to increase the population of cells and cause irreversible changes in their structure.
Developmental changes are controlled at speciﬁc checkpoints during the process and
following its conclusion (see Chap. 3, Fig. 3.13). Signals which guide development
are themselves an expression of an evolving genetic blueprint. They control cell
differentiation as well as the shaping of organs and the entire organism.

Development control algorithms are implemented through sequential induction
of cell proliferation and differentiation, where cells and signals are subject to hi-
erarchical management. Information may be conveyed through direct interactions
between adjacent cells or by hormonal signals (typically acting at short ranges). A
simple model which may serve to explain this process is the formation of a photore-
ceptor in the insect eye omnatidium. This element normally consists of eight separate
cells, controlled by a specialized cell called R8. The R8 cell is also sometimes called
BOSS—an acronym of the term Bride Of SevenlesS, referring to a speciﬁc mutation
which interferes with the differentiation of the 7th cell and reinforces the supervi-
sory role of the 8th cell. Figure 4.31 presents the differentiation algorithm for the
development of the omnatidium photoreceptor, showing the differences in processes
occurring on each side of the R8 cell. This differentiation mechanism results in asym-
metric arrangement of the photoreceptor element, which in turn enables the insect
to determine which direction the light is coming from. The staged, programmed
maturation of photoreceptor cells is an example of a generalized process from which
specialized organs and structures may emerge.

Basic Principles of Regulation in Biology
In general, it can be said that any activity which ensures the stability of biological
processes may be called regulation and that regulation is dependent on negative
feedback loops. Regulatory mechanisms work to maintain homeostasis of cells and
the organism, utilizing receptor systems which determine e.g. the concentrations of
various substances in blood or in cell cytoplasm.
On the other hand, signals which alter the default stabilization levels are called
steering signals. They originate beyond the loop which they control and may be
divided into intracellular signals (allosteric effectors) and hormonal signals which
guide the speciﬁc activity of the cell. Steering signals may also supervise the devel-
opment process by triggering the formation of new structures and expression of their
functions.
From the point of view of kinetics, steering signals control may be divided into
three groups:
1. Response control, characteristic of metabolic processes where the intensity of
a given process closely and continuously follows the changes in concentration
of a regulatory hormone. Examples include the reaction of hepatic cells to in-
sulin and glucagon. Such processes can be roughly compared to the action of
servomechanisms in a power steering system.
2. Extremal control (on/off signals), where the signal releases or inhibits a speciﬁc
process, e.g. secretion of stomach acid, cell division, apoptosis, sexual maturation
etc.An appropriate mechanical counterpart is the activation/deactivation of a light
switch by a photodetector.

3. Sequential control. This type of control is observed in development and growth.
Steering signals are issued sequentially, according to a speciﬁc algorithm. Each
stage of development is triggered once the previous stage has concluded and a
checkpoint has been reached. In the developing embryo this involves activation
of successive gene packets, while in cell development it applies to the action of
cyclins. Sequential control can also be observed in many macroscopic devices,
for instance in washing machines and assembly-line production environments. In
biological systems it is usually effected by activating speciﬁc genes.
4.7
Regulation Levels
Assuming that biological systems are, in fact, automatons and that their proper-
ties can be explained by their automatic nature, we can generalize and categorize
regulatory phenomena. One example of such categorization involves treating nega-
tive feedback loops as a basic mechanism of automatic regulation and—at the same
time—a basic building block of biological systems. Our ever-deepening knowledge
of regulatory mechanisms seems to support this theory and provides much evidence
of the universality of negative feedback loops.
The above assumptions force us to consider the function of more advanced bio-
logical mechanisms such as the nervous system, which enables ﬁne-tuned regulation
that would otherwise be impossible in a simple feedback loop. Two questions arise
in this scope: are such advanced mechanisms merely modiﬁed feedback loops? How
should the term “advanced regulation” be deﬁned?
In general, an advanced regulatory system is a system where the effector has
signiﬁcant freedom in choosing the strategy which it will apply to a given task. In
the above-described systems effector units (particularly intracellular ones) have no
such freedom—they follow a genetically-determined procedure. Advanced feedback
loops may, however, emerge as a result of linking many simpler systems. There are
severalwaysinwhichregulatorysystemsmaybecoupledtooneanother. Cooperation
occurs when the product of one system is used by another system. Bringing together
two contradictory systems reduces the amplitude of ﬂuctuations and promotes signal
attenuation. Finally, as mostly promising for the progress, systems can be linked via
coordination pathways, modifying the sensitivity of their receptors.
Sensitivity-based coupling enables one system to drive the action of another and
introduces a speciﬁc hierarchy of needs, similar to the hierarchy which exists between
the cell and the organism. However, coordination does not directly translate into
increased effector freedom as long as at least one receptor is not subject to control.
New properties may only emerge in systems which are fully coupled to each other,
where neither system maintains complete dominance (see Fig. 4.32A, B, C). Such
conditions occur naturally in the nervous system, owing to its enormous diversity of
feedback loops, all interlinked and capable of affecting one another’s actions. The
resulting “regulatory superloop” exhibits great variability, although it still relies on a
centralized memory store. The malleability and adaptability of this complex system

is far greater than that in any of its individual components. The “superloop” works
by implementing a single, shared task, but in doing so it may choose from a great
number of strategies, all of which lead to the same goal.
It should be noted that such “superloops” can be further integrated with one
another, providing even greater effector independence.
The presented “effector freedom” criterion enabled the French philosopher and
cybernetics expert Pierre de Latil to propose the following tiered structure of
regulation:
I.
stabilization tier, associated with regulation on the organism and cell level. Sys-
tems belonging to this tier work by following simple, rigid programming in
order to provide answers to questions such as how? and what? For instance, if
the concentration of some substance decreases, the cell must try to restore it in
a predetermined way. As long as regulation is based on the action of individ-
ual circuits (regardless of their complexity) the overall system belongs to the
stabilization tier.
II.
determinism tier, where systems achieve certain freedom in choosing how to
implement given tasks. This type of action is based on instincts (single answer
to the what? question) but may involve numerous answers to the how? question.
For instance, the need to acquire food is instinct-driven, but does not involve a
single, predetermined strategy—the regulatory system exercises its freedom by
choosing one of the available food acquisition strategies.
III. goal tier, which results from development of the cerebral cortex along with
massive improvements in both memory and reasoning mechanisms. Conscious,
abstract thinking introduces a new quality called the goal of action, where sys-
tems may freely determine not only how to proceed but also what to do. This
level of regulation is characteristic of Homo sapiens.

Fig. 4.33 Traditional proteome, where each circle represents a single protein. The length of each
vertex should, in theory, correspond to the duration of interaction between two proteins
actually known to biochemists. Genomics can be treated as a tool which allows us
to establish a complete set of proteins, including those which have not yet been
experimentally observed.
Simply knowing the sequences, structures or even functions of individual proteins
does not provide sufﬁcient insight into the biological machinery of living organisms.
The complexity of individual cells and entire organisms calls for functional classi-
ﬁcation of proteins. This task can be accomplished with a proteome—a theoretical
construct where individual elements (proteins) are grouped in a way which acknowl-
edgestheirmutualinteractionsandinterdependencies, characterizingtheinformation
pathways in a complex organism.
Most ongoing proteome construction projects focus on individual proteins as
the basic building blocks (Fig. 4.33). Due to the relatively large number of proteins
(between 25 and 40 thousand in the human organism), presenting them all on a single
graph with vertex lengths corresponds to the relative duration of interactions would
be unfeasible. This is why proteomes are often subdivided into functional subgroups
such as the metabolome (proteins involved in metabolic processes), interactome
(complex-forming proteins), kinomes (proteins which belong to the kinase family)
etc.

Fig. 4.34 Model proteome conforming to the description proposed in this chapter. Negative feed-
back loops are represented by lines (solid lines for effector-mediated relations and dashed lines for
receptor-mediated relations)
Figure 4.34 presents a sample proteome based on the assumptions and suggestions
outlined in this handbook. Our model should be considered strictly hypothetical since
it lacks numerical veriﬁcation.
The proposed construction of the proteome bases on the following assumptions:
1. The basic unit of the proteome is one negative feedback loop (rather than a single
protein) as the main regulation mechanism ensuring steady state and homeostasis,
2. Relations between units can be mediated by:
A – effectors,
B – receptors.
The effector relation is inherently cooperative: each effector may be targeted by
a signal sent by another feedback loop. The signal changes the efﬁciency of the
effector and may force a reaction without that effector’s “consent”. This type of
signal should be treated as a cooperation mechanism because it is issued in response
to a local surplus of a certain effector substrate.
Receptor-mediatedsignalsforcechangesinthereceptor’ssensitivity.Anyreceptor
affected in this manner will, in turn, adjust its own feedback loop, along with all
processes which participate in a given cycle.
Figure 4.34 depicts a model proteome based on negative feedback loops. Solid
lines indicate effector-mediated relations while dashed lines correspond to receptor-
mediated relations. Line length is irrelevant.
For the sake of comparison, Fig. 4.33 presents a traditional proteome, where each
unit corresponds to a single protein. According to its assumptions, the length of each

Fig. 4.35 Proteome model (see Fig. 4.34) extended with information regarding the molecular
structure of each loop
connecting line should indicate the relative stability of a protein complex (however,
this requirement is difﬁcult to fulﬁll given a large number of proteins). The model of
proteome building proposed in this chapter tries to avoid taking into account individ-
ual proteins. Assuming automatic control of all biological processes and the steady
state as the incoming program of their action the proteome used as a tool in studies
of the cell and organism strategy could be presented as the relation of independent
automatic devices rather than individual proteins. The automatic character of devices
controlling biological processes allows treating them as independent units involving
the ﬁnal, controlled products intermediates and the whole regulatory arrangement as
well as non-protein components of the process.
We believe that the construction of such proteome (Figs. 4.35 and 4.36) could
reveal in future studies the still hidden strategic relations in living cells and organisms.
Such a system, if properly simulated, would present a valuable tool, enabling
scientists to further study the variations (both random and targeted) in biological
processes. The effects of these variations could then be compared with existing med-
ical knowledge—for example the symptoms of known diseases. A suitable proteome
model seems to be very helpful in ascertaining the causes and effects of complex
pathological processes.
A complete, multi-tiered (including the tissue and organism tiers) in silico pro-
teome might even be called an “in silico organism”—it would facilitate virtual
experiments on humans which cannot be carried out in the real world for technical or
ethical reasons. It could also provide valuable insight into systemic pathologies which
are difﬁcult to study when focusing on small-scale subunits of living organisms.

Interrelationship In Organized Biological
Systems
Interrelationship is a prerequisite of function in organized
structures
Abstract Ensuring synchronization between processes which make up a complex
system requires functional interdependence, with multiple mechanisms cooperating
to achieve a predetermined ﬁnal state. Interrelationship involves multiple sys-
tems, each equipped with its own regulatory mechanism and hence operating
as a distinct entity. Such structural and functional isolation is evident in many
complex systems. Mutual dependences may take on two forms: cooperation and
coordination. If the product of one process acts as a substrate for another, we are
dealing with cooperation. In such cases both processes are subject to their own
separate control mechanisms. Coordination occurs when one process acts directly
upon the control mechanisms of other processes thereby establishing hierarchical de-
pendence. Biological hierarchies arise due to allosteric properties of receptor units
which can register signals issued by other autonomous processes. Compartmentation
of mutually dependent processes optimizes the functioning of cellular machinery.

The Need of Mutual Relations in Biological Systems
Assuming that all structures involved in biological functions belong to regulatory
loops allows us to determine—even considering the limitations of our scientiﬁc
knowledge—the principles of regulation and mutual relations in such automatic sys-
tems (as opposed to non-automatic systems, subjected to external decision-making
mechanisms and therefore unpredictable when acting on their own). Automaticity
is tied to independence, which can only be achieved in the presence of a negative
feedback loop. Individual components of an automatic system cannot be considered
independent.
As processes owe their independence to automatic control mechanisms, they need
to cooperate with one another to fulﬁll speciﬁc biological goals.
Stabilization of substance concentrations and/or biological activity is a result of
genetic programming implemented by the cell. In an ideal organism or cell existing
in an unchanging environment, all forms of cooperation other than the exchange of

reaction substrates could be neglected (in particular, there would be no need for
activation or inhibition mechanisms). In reality, however, interaction with the
external environment introduces random stimuli which translate into unpredictable
ﬂuctuations in the intensity of biological processes and the availability of key
substances. Such ﬂuctuations can be caused by inﬂow and outﬂow of substrates and
reaction products as well as by forced activation of cells. The problem is compounded
by the existence of a barrier (membrane) which hampers transmission of substances
and signals between cellular compartments. Unpredictability becomes particularly
troublesome in processes whose individual stages occur in different areas of the cell.
Signiﬁcant deviations from the norm may arise as a result of variable intensity of
biological processes. While oscillations are an inherent feature of systems subjected
to automatic regulation with negative feedback loops, they may become a problem
if the resulting changes are too severe.
5.2
Cooperation and Coordination
Regulatory systems may assist one another either by cooperation or by coordination.
Cooperation is understood as correlation of independent processes based on a
shared pool of products or substrates, where neither process is subordinated to the
other. Coordination is also a manifestation of correlated activities, but in this case
one process is in direct control of the other, giving rise to a hierarchical structure.
Biological cooperation may be compared to a contract between two factories, one of
which makes ball bearings while the other uses them in the machines it assembles. In
a cooperative system, both factories retain their independence. If, however, the ball
bearing manufacturer were to become a branch of the machine factory or if its pro-
duction rate was fully dependent on the machine assembly rate, we would be dealing
with more than a simple sale/purchase contract. In such circumstances, control over
the entire manufacturing process would rest with the machine factory. Clearly, such
centralized control introduces a hierarchical structure and should therefore be treated
as a form of coordination.
Similar properties can be observed in biological systems. While the “technical-
ities” of coordination and cooperation mechanisms differ from process to process,
their general principles remain the same. Understanding them provides insight into
the structure and function of biological systems.
The nature of a negative feedback loop, which underpins biological regulatory
systems, is to restore stability. Maintaining a steady state is therefore—out of
necessity—the core principle of biological programming, both in the cell and in the
organism as a whole.
Major deviations from the evolutionarily-conditioned substance or activity levels
are caused by uncontrollable, random events originating in the external environment.
This applies both to cells and to organisms. Individual cells operate in a state of rel-
ative homeostasis but they also participate in hierarchical systems and their function
is subordinated to the requirements of their host organism. The organism can force
activation or deactivation of certain cells in order to stabilize its own vital parame-
ters, such as blood glucose levels. The signals issued by the organism (hormones)
are treated as commands and may activate various mechanisms in each cell for the

loops. A. The product of one process used as a substrate in the effector unit of another process,
in accordance with a negative feedback loop. B. The product of one process used as a substrate

cycle, glycolysis, glycogen synthesis etc.) C. Cooperation as applied to cellular metabolism
beneﬁt of a distributed process, producing results which the cell would not otherwise
generate on its own.
The organism comes into frequent contact with the outside world; for instance
through variations in food intake, however such interaction presents dangers for the
state of homeostasis .
Due to the expected randomness and ﬂuctuations, biological systems cannot rely
solely on cooperation. The organism responds to these challenges by coordinating
its internal processes via hormonal signals.
In order to perform the action requested by the organism, the cell must ﬁrst
ensure its own stability by means of internal coordination. It does so by generating
intracellular steering signals, which guide its internal processes. This property allows
the cell to counteract major deviations which emerge as a result of inconsistent
activity of internal regulatory mechanisms.
In individual cells, both cooperation and coordination are facilitated by the limited
space in which the linked processes need to take place.
Substance exchange is the most basic form of cooperation.As such, it is frequently
observed in living cells. Examples include the coupling between DNA synthesis
and the pentose cycle (which provides pentoses), between glycogen synthesis and
glucose-6-phosphate synthesis, between globin synthesis and heme synthesis etc.
Such cooperation occurs when the product of one reaction is a substrate for another
reaction, resulting in a “supply chain” condition. Increased demand for the ﬁnal
product causes a decrease in its concentration. This, in turn, triggers control mech-
anisms which act to increase supply. Figures 5.1 and 5.2 present the cooperation of

automatic processes where the product of one process is used as a substrate in the
effector unit of another process.
If, however, the cooperation of two processes is subject to signiﬁcant disruptions
(for instance if both processes occur in separate compartments of the cell or if the
rapid reaction rate makes storage of intermediate products unfeasible), coordination
becomes a necessity. Coordinating signals act as “administrators”, increasing de-
mand for overproduced substances or inhibiting the processes which produce them.
Coordination is implemented by exploiting the product of one reaction as an allosteric
effector (not a substrate) in another process. The controlling process modiﬁes the sen-
sitivity of the subjective regulatory loop instead of directly altering the rate at which
a given product is consumed. Figure 5.3 presents a model view of coordination.
In systems which rely on negative feedback loops the stabilization curve typically
assumes the form of a sinusoid. The effects of cooperation and coordination can be
described as changes in its shape or oscillation level.
The action of a cooperating system which consumes a given substance may result
in changed frequency and (optionally) amplitude of oscillations of its stabilization
curve. Increased demand for the product precipitates a decline in its concentration and
triggers an increase in its production rate. However, as the receptors of cooperating
systems do not change their sensitivity, the target product concentration must remain

the same. Thus, any changes are effectively limited to the shape of the stabilization
curve (see Fig. 5.4). On the other hand, coordinating signals (action of allosteric
effectors) alter the sensitivity of receptors, thereby modifying the initial biological
program and forcing a change in the target product concentration or activity level
(Fig. 5.5). This phenomenon manifests itself as a change in the slope gradient on
the attached allosteric receptor transformation diagram (Fig. 5.6), similarly to the
effect of allosteric effectors on hemoglobin. It can be observed both in the covalent
modiﬁcation of enzymes (i.e. the action of hormones) and as a result of noncovalent
interactioninitiatedbyanallostericeffector(e.g. anintracellularcoordinatingsignal).

In general, coordination can be deﬁned as any action which affects the sensitivity
of receptors other than one’s own, facilitating interrelation of separate systems in the
pursuit of a common goal.
As both regulatory and coordinating mechanisms exploit the allosteric properties
of signal-receptor interactions, distinguishing them may appear difﬁcult. We can,
however, assume, that any loop in which the detector subunit exhibits afﬁnity to
the product released by its corresponding effector, is a regulatory mechanism. If the
detector also registers signals from other systems, the changes triggered by such sig-
nals may be counted among coordinating effects (Figs. 5.7 and 5.8) For instance, if a
blood glucose concentration receptor triggers a process which results in modiﬁcation
of blood glucose levels, the action of the system can best be described as self-
regulatory. If, however, the same detector also activates other processes, resulting,
e.g. in modifying the concentration of fatty acids in blood, then we are dealing with
coordination.

The Characteristics of Process Coordination in Individual
Cells and Organisms
Intracellular coordinating signals may be treated as counterparts of hormonal signals:
they both share a similar mechanism of action, acting on receptors and altering their
most fundamental property, i.e. sensitivity. However, the speciﬁcity of intracellular

coordination pathways are somewhat different than in the case of hormones: such
pathways rely on noncovalent interaction between signals and receptors (contrary to
hormones, which usually trigger phosphorylation or other covalent modiﬁcations).
It can therefore be said that intracellular coordinating signals exert inﬂuence on
independent processes, but do not directly command them.
Another difference between both types of signals is the principle of unampliﬁed
action. Inside a cell, the distance traveled by a coordinating signal is usually short
(negligible dilution of signal), negating the need for ampliﬁcation. This issue is also
related to the lack of a need for encoding. Encoding systems become necessary when
the coordinating signal must undergo signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation—a process which
also happens to aggravate any errors or distortions. The cells signals which effect
intracellular coordination processes (products of the regulatory loops) are commonly
called allosteric effectors.
Although the presented principles seem very generic, biological systems some-
times depart from them. Such departures involve both intracellular and hormonal
signals (i.e. signals which the organism uses to control the function of individual
cells). They are usually observed in circumstances where following established prin-
ciples would result in unacceptable risk to proper transduction of the signal or the
action of any component of the feedback loop (effector or receptor).
As a general rule, hormonal signals override intracellular signals. Hormones act
by forming permanent, covalent bonds with proteins mediating signal and should
therefore be treated as commands. However, in some cases obeying such commands
involves the risk that the cell will become exhausted and unable to maintain its
own vital parameters at an acceptable level. This issue is particularly important for
enzymes which interfere with key cellular machinery. One example is the action of
glucagon and insulin which control a critically important process (glycolysis) and
can therefore easily drive the cell into metabolic distress. Both hormones strongly
affectglycolysisbywayofphosphofructokinasephosphorylation, howeverinsteadof
directly interacting with phosphofructokinase-1, they act upon phosphofructokinase-
2–an enzyme whose product forms a noncovalent bond with phosphofructokinase-1.
Owing to this mechanism, a critically stressed hepatocyte may refuse to obey a
command which threatens its own survival. This phenomenon is, however, something
of an exception: similar safeguards do not exist in many other less important for cell
surviving processes, for instance glycogen degradation, where the enzyme acting
directly on glycogen (glycogen phosphorylase) is subject to covalent modiﬁcation
by hormones.
Atypical properties can also be observed in certain intracellular pathways such as
the urea cycle, which involves signal coding. As noted above, intracellular signals
are not usually encoded because they do not require ampliﬁcation and are therefore
largely protected against errors. Encoding may, however, become necessary when-
ever there is a signiﬁcant risk of signal misinterpretation. Such a situation is observed
in the urea synthesis process where an intense inﬂux of nitrogen containing substrates
into the hepatic cell may be uncorrelated with mitochondrial synthesis of carbamoyl
phosphate.

Fig. 5.9 Coordination (dashed line) of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic stages of the urea cycle
As aminoacid components of the urea cycle may be found in the mitochondrion
regardless of this metabolic pathway, there is a risk that the coordinating signal could
be misinterpreted if the messenger molecule were a simple aminoacid. Hence, the
urea cycle coordination must be based on a substance which does not normally occur
in mitochondria. This requirement is fulﬁlled by N-acetylglutamate which indicates
the concentration of arginine in the cytoplasm. Synthesis of N-acetylglutamate is
triggered by arginine, whose high concentration means that ornithine (a competitive
arginase inhibitor) is not being transformed into citrulline at a rapid enough rate and
that the process needs to be upregulated (Fig. 5.9).
We can therefore conclude that while standard signal transduction principles apply
in most circumstances, special cases may require deviations from generic solutions.

of the presented activity. Upregulated metabolic pathways are shown in color
Cells express their specialized functions in response to commands issued by the
organism. They are, however, autonomous, and if commands do not arrive, they may
become independent, which is evidenced by changes in their behavioral strategies.
The mechanisms of cellular cooperation and coordination, along with their impact
on energy transfer and storage processes, have been extensively studied. They can be
easily traced e.g. by observing the hormonal regulation of hepatic functions following
consumption of food (fed-state), during fasting and in intermediate phases. Given an
abundance of nutrients (i.e. immediately following a meal) the organism releases a
hormone (insulin) which forces hepatocytes to intensify their involvement in nutrient
sequestration. On the other hand, if the organism is starving, liver cells are mobilized
to inject additional nutrients into the bloodstream by consuming energy stores.
Regulation and coordination mechanisms involved in day-to-day functioning of
the organism must be able to react to stimuli in a timely fashion. Thus, energy transfer
andstorageshouldbemanagedbyactivationandinhibitionofexistingenzymesrather
than by changing their concentrations via transcription and translation.
Figure 5.10 presents the effect of insulin on liver cells—promoting sequestra-
tion of nutrients following a meal. In this case, the hepatocyte synthesizes fatty

Fig. 5.11 Changes in hepatic metabolism resulting from reduction in blood glucose levels. The
top right-hand inset depicts the ﬂuctuating blood glucose levels. Dashed lines indicate intracellular
regulatory and coordinating signals. Upregulated metabolic pathways are shown in color
acids by activating carboxylase, acetyl-CoA and ATP-citrate lyases. Sequestration
of triglycerides in the form of adipose tissue is enabled by insulin-mediated absorp-
tion of glucose into adipocytes. The combined effect of high blood glucose levels
and the topping-off of glycogen stores effectively prevents the organism from further
synthesis of sugars (gluconeogenesis)
Large-scale synthesis of fatty acids in liver cells requires signiﬁcant quantities
of ATP and involves oxidation processes where some of the nutrients are burned in
order to power ongoing reactions. Thus, fatty acid synthesis is coupled to synthesis of
ATP and NADPH. In fact, according to regulation principles, it is the overabundance
of ATP and NADH which inhibits citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and
α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The role of this mechanism is to supply sufﬁcient
energy for sequestration processes. Most of the available glucose is converted into
fatty acids while the rest is consumed in the pentose shunt associated with production
of NADPH.
During periods of starvation (Fig. 5.11.) the role of glucagon increases (i.e. the
insulin/glucagon ratio drops). The increased release of glucagon is a result of de-
creased blood glucose levels (note that maintaining steady concentration of glucose
in blood is of critical importance to the organism). Glucagon works by reorienting
the organism’s energy transfer and storage processes. Fatty acid synthesis is halted

Fig. 5.12 Regulation and coordination of energy conversion processes in a hepatic cell given a lack
of coercive hormonal signals. The top right-hand inset depicts the ﬂuctuating blood glucose levels.
Dashed lines indicate intracellular regulatory and coordinating signals
via inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and pyruvate kinase as well as activation of
fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Blood glucose deﬁciency is compensated for by stim-
ulation of gluconeogenesis, i.e. synthesis of glucose from aminoacids, lactate and
glycerol derived from lipolysis. When oxaloacetate becomes scarce, the liver cell
may draw additional energy from β-oxidation, ejecting ketone bodies (a byproduct
of acetyl-CoA) into the bloodstream.
During intermediate stages, i.e. when the blood glucose concentration is close to
its biological optimum (approximately 5 mmol/l) and when insulin and glucagon are
in relative equilibrium, the cell becomes independent. Its own regulatory mechanisms
(based on noncovalent bonds) assume control, while the energy conversion processes
occurring inside the cell are subject to allosteric regulation, primarily by ATP and
NADH. The cell now focuses on maintaining optimal levels of ATP and NADH in
its own cytoplasm and does not actively participate in ensuring homeostasis of the
organism as a whole (Fig. 5.12).
An independent hepatocyte may synthesize fatty acids and glucose even when no
hormonal signals are present; however in such cases sequestration of nutrients is not
the primary goal of the cell. Rather, the hepatocyte concerns itself with maintaining
a steady concentration of energy carriers, treating synthesis as a convenient way to
purge excess carriers. This change in strategy becomes evident in the readjustment of
regulatory mechanisms involved e.g. in glycolysis. Given an abundance of nutrients,
glycolysis is activated by an external mediator (insulin) as a prerequisite of intensiﬁed

Fig. 5.13 Collaborative energy management given an abundance of nutrients
sequestration. In an independent cell the same process is controlled by citrate, which
promotes fatty acid synthesis but—unlike insulin—also inhibits glycolysis. This
means that a cell which is already rich inATP may actively protect itself from further
absorption of nutrients. Consequently, both ATP degradation pathways (fatty acid
synthesis activated by citrate as well as glucose synthesis mediated by ATP and
acetyl-CoA) remain open. The relatively low demand for glucose (compared with
post-meal conditions) is satisﬁed by absorbing glucose directly from the bloodstream
or by extracting it from glycogen with the use of glycogen phosphorylase, whose
activity remains low but sufﬁcient to cover the energy requirements of the liver cell.
Full independence of the hepatocyte is a short-lived condition and does not di-
rectly correspond to periods between meals (which can indeed be quite long). Cells
can remain shortly independent only when the contradictory activity of insulin and
glucagon remains at equal effectiveness; however both hormones are active even
when no food is being consumed—for instance, when strenuous physical exertion
causes a signiﬁcant drop in blood glucose levels.
Figures 5.13, 5.14 and 5.15 present organ collaboration in the scope of en-
ergy management, as reﬂected by the relation between glucagon and insulin levels.

Hormone concentrations range from 0.5 μU pg−1 (U—unit) following a meal to 0.05
μU pg−1 during periods of starvation. During intermediate stages, when hepatocytes
act independently, these values are close to 0.15 μU pg−1.
Tight collaboration between hepatocytes and the organism, regardless of the avail-
ability of nutrients (i.e. when nutrients are abundant, during periods of starvation and
in intermediate stages), suggests that—according to the principles outlined above—
cells and organism share similar goals and collaborate even though each of these
units is subject to its own regulatory mechanisms. In both cases regulation occurs
automatically, according to biological programming. Both types of regulatory loops
act to stabilize the concentrations of vital substances measured—either in blood (the
organism) or in mitochondrion and cytoplasm (cells). Both systems (the organism
and cell) use specialized messenger molecules: the organism relies on hormones (for
instance, insulin and glucagon) while cells produce allosteric effectors (ATP, NADH,
acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, citrate, ADP, AMP and NAD). Both systems also exploit
specialized structural solutions which assist in regulation.

Mutual Support Between Cells and the Organism—
Interdependence Related to Gene Expression (Slow Effects)
If both the organism and its environment are in a stable state, the concentrations of
enzymes and other proteins involved in biological functions are deﬁned by biological
programming. Under such conditions, interrelationship may be realized by means of
standard activation or inhibition (depending on their natural dynamics).
If, however, the environment exhibits high variability and adaptations need to be
introduced, quantitative changes associated with synthesis of additional substances
become important. One example is hypoxia caused by severe blood loss, where
synthesis of new blood cells is greatly intensiﬁed. Although erythropoiesis is a con-
tinually occurring process, it can be signiﬁcantly upregulated by the action of certain

Since each occurs in a separate cellular compartments, they must all be coordinated
in order to provide matching concentrations of various substances.
In a separate process, the hemoglobin synthesis apparatus (mostly based on
ribosomes) also undergoes rapid expansion.
Hormonal signals induce transcription of mRNA and rRNA in the nucleolus. Syn-
thesis of ribosomal proteins occurs in the cytosol. Once synthesized, proteins migrate
to the nucleolus where ribosomal subunits are formed and released back into the cy-
tosol. At the same time, mRNA strands travel from the nucleus to the cytosol, where
the required proteins can be synthesized (Fig. 5.16). The pathway for signals which
trigger hemoglobin synthesis involves transcription and is controlled by hormones.
It should, however, be noted that translation is subject to its own hormonal control,
which also assists in the synthesis of hemoglobin. A hemoglobin-synthesizing cell
includes a special mechanism capable of inhibiting translation. Its action is dependent
on the concentration of heme: deﬁciency of heme halts further synthesis of globin
and therefore acts as a coordinator (Fig. 5.17).
Heme synthesis (occurring in the mitochondrion) is also controlled by hormones
as it depends on the availability of iron, which has to be drawn from outside the cell.
Hemoglobin synthesis may proceed only if ample iron is available—thus, the re-
sponse to hypoxia is conditioned by many independent (though mutually supportive)
control processes.
5.5.1
The Structural Underpinnings of Interrelationship
The ﬂow of signals which coordinate biological processes can be modeled on the
basis of regulation principles.
As a rule, the path of each coordinating signal is a branch of some regulatory
loop. Once released, the signal seeks out the receptor of another loop and adjusts its
sensitivity to its own loop. Inside the cell, signals are usually represented by products
of the cell’s own controlled biological processes. On the other hand, organisms tend
to rely on hormonal and neuronal signals, generated by specialized cells whose
primary role is to assist in coordination (Fig. 5.19).
The need for correlated action becomes clear if we refer to the rules of regulation,
determining the nature of both substrate and product of a given process (controlled
by a feedback loop) and tracing the path of the product with respect to its biological
purpose.
Coordination should be interpreted as a means of improving interrelationship
whenever major deviations in the controlled quantity could be avoided (for instance,
if a controlled substance exhibits undesirable activity or is otherwise toxic). However,
coordination places an additional burden on biological systems as it forces them to
provide receptors for external signals (Fig. 5.20). A solution to this dilemma comes
in the form of receptor proteins, capable of binding their own product in addition
to the products of regulatory processes to which a given system is coupled. Such
proteins are almost exclusively eallosteric, consisting of subunits and able to bind

effector molecules in speciﬁc sites—just like hemoglobin, which can bind BPG
(2,3-bipohosphoglycerate) as well as protons by way of the Bohr effect.
It appears that the need for coordination does not apply to all processes. Speciﬁ-
cally, coordination can be avoided in processes which are of secondary importance
to the cell. It is also unnecessary for sparse products, where signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations
are not harmful to the cell or the organism.
Selected examples of metabolic pathways which require coordination are depicted
in Fig. 5.21. As mentioned above, these are branching processes; moreover, their in-
dividual branches are often highly spontaneous and therefore irreversible. The ﬁgure
presents processes (and parts thereof) which involve transmembrane transport (per-
formed in separate organelles), where efﬁcient transduction of products or substrates
becomes difﬁcult given signiﬁcant variations in their availability or particularly rapid
reaction rates.
Coordination of processes becomes easier if these processes share a common
stage. The enzyme which catalyzes this stage (i.e. corresponds to a fork in the
metabolicpathway)isnaturallyimportantforbothintertwinedprocesses. Suchstages
and the enzymes which catalyze them are called key stages and key enzymes, par-
ticularly if they affect vitally important processes. Examples include energy transfer

A similar rule applies to hormonal coordination. A single hormone can control
many processes by attaching itself to receptors exposed by many different types
of cells (Fig. 5.22). Intracellular signal branching, resulting in the activation of
interdependent processes, is also an example of complex coordination (Fig. 5.22
-right) This type of action is observed e.g. in the control of sequestration processes
effected by insulin (Fig. 5.23). Each hormone, particularly a nonspeciﬁc one, can
control a large number of processes simultaneously.

The Role of Common Metabolite in Complex Process
Coordination
If a coordination pathway simultaneously affects many linked processes, one of its
components may become an indicator for a whole set of biological mechanisms
which together generate the required effect. This strategic selection of a common
marker is an important “technical solution” in many integration processes. As an
example, let us consider the coordination of nutrient sequestration which depends
on blood glucose levels.
Glucose is always present in bloodstream where its concentration can be readily
measured. It is also an integrating component in the management of lipids deposits
as a source of oxaloacetate required for degradation of acetyl-CoA. By penetrating
adipose cells, glucose becomes a source of glycerol-3-phosphate, powering fatty
acid sequestration (lipogenesis). As glucose processing is coupled to many energy
management mechanisms, each such mechanism may affect blood glucose levels.

5.5
Mutual Support Between Cells and the Organism—Interdependence . . .
189
The storage of glucose in the form of glycogen is only meant as a buffer (no
more than ∼600 kcal is available at any given time, compared to the average basal
metabolic rate of approximately 1,600 kcal/day for a typical human). Thus, glucose
sequestration and subsequent release must be a highly dynamic process. High con-
centrations of glucose affect the spontaneity of its intracellular metabolic pathways.
Glucose is a good coordinator of energy management processes given its ubiquity,
universality and the critical role it plays in many tissues such as muscles, blood and
brain matter. It should also be noted that glucose is effectively the only nutrient whose
concentration in blood is never subject to major ﬂuctuations—thus, any changes in its
levels are indicative of the state of energy management processes in the organism as a
whole.
Glucose concentration directly affects the release of two basic hormones: insulin
and glucagon. Other hormones such as catecholamines or adrenal cortex hormones,
are less important for managing the organism’s energy stores. Their usually come
into play under stress conditions (catecholamines) or during prolonged periods of
starvation when glycogen stores are depleted and the organism must draw energy
from aminoacids (adrenal cortex hormones).
Nutrient sequestration can be affected—via increased insulin release—by certain
gastrointestinal hormones (incretins) such as GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide),
whose production is stimulated by the presence of glucose and fatty acids in the
small intestine: an interesting example of how the organism predicts and prepares
itself for assimilation of nutrients.
The presence ofsubstanceswhichactasuniversalcontrolindicatorsisbiologically
advantageous and can be observed in many different mechanisms. For instance, the
entire nitrogen cycle in the E. coli bacteria is based on measuring the concentration
of glycin and alanin. Bacterial glutamine synthetase consist of twelve subunits and
has been shown to contain no less than nine allosteric binding sites upon which
coordinating signals may act. These signals are, in turn, generated by cooperating
processes and include carbamoyl phosphate, glucosamine-6-phosphate, AMP, CTP
and several aminoacids (tryptophan, histidine, serine, glycine and alanine). It should
be noted that not all aminoacids are actively involved in controlling the activity of
the synthetase complex: from among the available molecules, alanine and glycine
have been selected as the most common and the most intimately tied to the bacterial
nitrogen metabolism. A similar function appears to be performed by cyclins, whose
synthesis is coupled (both in terms of reactions and substrates) to cell division,
making them a good indicator of the division process.
5.5.3
Signal Effectiveness and the Structuring of Mutual
Relations in Metabolism
In order to better understand the efﬁciency of regulation, cooperation and coordi-
nation, we should consider the effectiveness of biological signals. This property is
determined by the intensity of the signal and the sensitivity of its receptor; however it

may also relate to the signal’s inﬂuence (the scope of activation or inhibition effects
it produces).
Comparing the relative effects of various allosteric effectors on coordinated pro-
cesses enables us to deﬁne a clear structure of coordination. The gradation of signal
effectiveness is subject to certain rules. Hormones are usually far more potent than
concentration-mediated signals (which characterize intracellular coordination) as
their action involves signal ampliﬁcation and covalent modiﬁcations of receptors. It
is, however, more difﬁcult to ascertain the relative hierarchy of the cell’s own sig-
nalling pathways. This hierarchy depends on the sensitivity of the regulatory enzyme
to a given signal (which is constant) and on the concentration of signal molecules
(which may vary).
For instance, we should expect that the effect of ATP—an allosteric effector
involved in the cell’s energy management processes—upon mitochondrial enzymes
will be stronger than its corresponding inﬂuence on cytosolic enzymes as ATP is
highly diluted in cytosol compared to its mitochondrial concentration.
Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle involve several checkpoints where they may
be inhibited by ATP. Proper description of these coordination processes requires
a comparative assessment of ATP-mediated inhibition at each checkpoint for a given
concentration of ATP.
In order to ascertain the speciﬁcity of coordination, we must ﬁrst determine the
afﬁnity of the enzyme regulatory subunit (or other receptor system) to the allosteric
effector as well the sensitivity of the entire system to the coordinating signal.
Variable signal afﬁnity can be observed in many circumstances. One example is
the coordination of ribosomal protein and rRNA synthesis, based on the ability of
proteins to form complexes with rRNA and mRNA with differing levels of afﬁnity.
Once synthesized, ribosomal proteins preferentially bind to rRNA (whose syn-
thesis is mediated by hormones), creating ribosomes. This process continues until
all available rRNA is consumed and free ribosomal proteins begin to build up. At
this point freshly synthesized proteins start binding to the promoter fragment of their
own RNA template, effectively halting the synthesis process (Fig. 5.24).
A similar problem occurs in coordination of cell division processes, where spe-
cialized proteins called cyclins are synthesized in tandem with division mediators.

5.5
Mutual Support Between Cells and the Organism—Interdependence . . .
191
The energy and material expenses incurred by cyclin synthesis hamper the synthesis
of proteins involved in cell division; however the latter group must be prioritized.
Thus, cyclins amass at a slower rate, reaching their peak concentration only after the
synthesis of the required division proteins and nucleic acids has concluded. Rapid
degradation of cyclins triggers the next step in the division cascade. In this way a
time- and energy-consuming process may act as a controller for other mechanisms
associated with cell division. Instead of a “biological clock” we are dealing with
coordinating action, dependent—much like the cell itself—on the available energy
stores and supplies of substrates.
5.5.4
Interrelationship in Times of Crisis—Safety Valves
Automatic regulation and coordination mechanisms allow cells to maintain proper
substance concentrations and activity levels in spite of environmental changes. How-
ever, adaptability has its limits. A particularly acute crisis emerges when the cellular
metabolic pathways are blocked by insufﬁcient availability of oxygen. Energy re-
quirements cannot be met if the cell is unable to metabolize nutrients. This is
evidenced e.g. in skeletal muscle cells, which on the one hand require an extensive
network of blood vessels, but on the other hand must be able to contract, limit-
ing their ability to absorb oxygen from the bloodstream. One consequence of this
apparent paradox is the synthesis of lactic acid. Given an insufﬁcient supply of
oxygen, this byproduct cannot be further metabolized and therefore builds up in
the muscle cell. High levels of lactic acid threaten the cell by lowering its pH, in-
creasing osmotic pressure and—most importantly—inhibiting glycolysis by altering
its oxidation-reduction potential and interfering with enzymes which participate in
breaking down glucose.
If the cellular regulatory mechanisms are unable to prevent excessive buildup of
lactic acid, the only solution is to expel this unwanted byproduct into the bloodstream
where acidiﬁcation can be counteracted by other regulatory systems (such as the liver,
capable of consuming lactic acid). This mechanism can be compared to a safety
valve which prevents the destruction of an overpressurized boiler by venting excess
steam. A similar situation occurs during starvation when the relative deﬁciency of
oxaloacetic acid inhibits the Krebs cycle and hampers further metabolism of acetyl-
CoA (extracted from fatty acids degradation), resulting in increased production of
ketone bodies which must also be ejected into the bloodstream. Oxaloacetate acid
synthesis is largely dependent on the supply of glucose (a key source of pyruvate).
Many organisms have evolved coordination mechanisms which enable them
to handle the byproducts of metabolism appearing in the bloodstream. Naturally,
single-cell organisms have no such problems and simply expel unneeded substances
(alcohol, lactate, acetoacetate etc.) until their concentration in the environment halts
cell proliferation.
Lactic acid is produced mainly by muscle cells and erythrocytes, and metab-
olized by hepatocytes. A similar mechanism applies to ketone bodies, which are

192
5
Interrelationship In Organized Biological Systems
generated in the liver and broken down in the brain, heart, kidneys and skeletal
muscles.
5.6
Specialization of Cells Interrelationship
Specialization results in functional differentiation and requires active relationship
if the differentiated elements are to constitute a biological entity (a cell or an or-
ganism). Examples of specialization include organelles (compartments) in the cell
and organs in the organism, although each of these groups follows different princi-
ples. Cell organelles are self-contained intracellular subunits which assist the cell in
achieving its strategic goals. They facilitate cooperation and coordination but also
enable separation of processes which would otherwise interfere with one another
(such as synthesis and degradation). An example of this mechanism is β-oxidation
and synthesis of fatty acids. Furthermore, some processes are potentially harmful to
their environment and need to be isolated (this includes lysosome activity).
Given our present state of knowledge, it would be difﬁcult to accurately and unam-
biguously describe the strategies on intercellular compartmentation. Some enzymes
change their location as a result of evolutionary processes. For instance, rhodanase
has migrated from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrion in the course of evolution.
Explaining this shift would require good knowledge of the interactions between rho-
danase and the intracellular environment; however it also proves that at least in some
cases enzyme location is not crucially important.
In light of the above facts, we may ask why glycolysis—a degradation process—is
not itself restricted to the mitochondrion. The answer lies in the natural strategies
applied to separation and aggregation of intracellular processes. Assuming that sep-
aration of contradictory processes, while useful, is not of key importance, enables
us to consider other factors which may inﬂuence their location. In the presented
case, synthesis ofATP and other energy carriers is more important than any potential
beneﬁts derived from physical separation of the relevant metabolic pathways (note
that mitochondrion-independent glycolysis is an important source of ATP).
A crucial property of glycolytic ATP synthesis is its independence of an ex-
ternal oxygen supply. In contrast, the Krebs cycle and conjugated with it other
mitochondrial processes slow down whenever oxygen becomes scarce. Under such
circumstances an oxygen-free energy supply becomes critically important and can-
not be subordinated to mitochondrial processes. Of course, relinquishing physical
separation of glycolysis components introduces the need for accurate control and co-
ordination, which in turn explains the importance of regulatory processes associated
with glucose metabolism.
Considering the organism as a whole, specialization should be understood as a
consequence of cell differentiation. On this level interrelation means the difference
between a pool of random cells and an efﬁcient organ which can assist its host organ-
ism in maintaining homeostasis. In animals cooperation is enabled by transporting
substances via the bloodstream while the coordination of differentiated tissues occurs
by way of hormones or (in certain cases) neuronal signalling.

5.7
H. Hypothesis
193
The function of the organism is based on a homeostasis program “encoded” in
the structure of its receptors.
Ingeneral, thetermorganism isappliedtoanygroupofindependent, differentiated
units which together constitute a higher-level structure and coordinate their actions
in pursuit of a common goal. This process opens up avenues of development not
available to undifferentiated units such as cells.
The word organism may also be used in relation to the social structure of a state, or
an insect colony comprising individual castes which communicate through chemical
means (pheromones) and through physical contact. Examples of this phenomenon
include ant and bee colonies.
In humans, the “colony” model can best be observed in the immune system, which
also consists of specialized “castes” of cells—workers (B and T lymphocytes) and
soldiers (monocytes, killer cells and phages). Both groups originate from similar
nonspeciﬁc proliferation centers (stem cells, which can be compared to ant colony
queens) and both exhibit the ability to gain a speciﬁc “personality” via interaction
with the histocompatibility complex and speciﬁc aroma. Also mutual understanding
in each system is possible by direct contact and hormonal messages (much like
pheromones, lymphokines). Moreover, both may use memory and be able to acquire
experiences.
The level of similarities between such disparate biological systems suggests a
common organizational strategy based on the principles of information theory.
5.7
H. Hypothesis
5.7.1
H.5. The Criteria of Life
Expanding biological knowledge allows us to study the strategies used by nature.
However, we still lack a satisfactory deﬁnition of the very notion of life. Self-
organized, autonomous biological systems are usually said to be “alive”; however this
inclusive criterion does not posit any speciﬁc boundaries. The question whether cer-
tainstructures(particularlysubcellularones)arealiveremainsunresolved. Moreover,
there is still no scientiﬁc consensus regarding the procedural deﬁnition of life.
As can be expected, this issue has been approached by a great many researchers
over the course of history. It seems that the deﬁnition which most closely matches our
modern scientiﬁc knowledge is the one proposed by Claude Bernard, who focused on
the independence of biological systems, i.e. their ability to function under varying en-
vironmental conditions. Increasing freedom of action—corresponding to increases in
the complexity of biological systems—appears to be the most general deﬁning char-
acteristic of life. Freedom of action can therefore be treated as a measure of the com-
plexity of an automaton, reﬂected by its capability to make autonomous decisions.
The properties and characteristics of structures which we call “alive” may be ex-
plained by their automatic behavior. It would, however, be misleading to fully equate
a biological system to an automaton. Modern technology, particularly robotics,
creates automata which sometimes closely resemble living organisms, blurring the

194
5
Interrelationship In Organized Biological Systems
border between life and technology. Nevertheless, biological entities differ from
even the most intricate robots: they are governed by speciﬁc rules which determine
the structural and functional differences between various types of organisms. Life is
subject to certain restrictions not observed in robotics. For instance, a fundamental
aspect of nature is the phenomenon of programmed death—the result of biological
strategies which focus on the survival of entire systems rather than individual en-
tities, as a means of ensuring harmony and maintaining equilibrium. All properly
constructed biological entities must include death as part of their natural program-
ming. In cells, this programming is evidenced by limitations in the possible number
of divisions, along with senescence and apoptosis. The inclusion of a terminating
function (death) in a biological program calls for a clock-like mechanism, capable
of measuring time. Cyclical processes, such as the circadian rhythm, which fulﬁlls
the role of a “biological clock”, are crucial for living organisms. Entities whose pro-
gramming does not involve the possibility of death—for instance tumor cells—are
considered pathological. (Note, however, that this group does not include gametes,
where only the genetic information can be called “immortal”—individual gametes
can and do undergo controlled death). Cells which do not age or die are inconsistent
with the principles of nature. In this aspect, the deﬁnition of life must necessarily
be enumerative: nature itself determines what is and what isn’t alive. Close study of
biological entities straddling the border between the animate and inanimate worlds
reveals the importance of controlled death in natural systems.
By analyzing and comparing the genomes of primitive organisms and other bio-
logical entities we can quickly derive a minimal set of genes and functions required
to support what is commonly understood as life. Let us focus on the erythrocyte,
which is clearly a biological structure (even though it cannot reproduce). The fact
that it derives from a fully functional cell makes it a good test subject. Erythrocytes
retain automatic control of metabolic processes (steady state), maintaining proper
ion gradients and oxidation-reduction potentials which enable them to perform their
function. They also actively counteract deviations which emerge as a result of cycli-
cal migrations from the lungs to other tissues. What is more, they are subject to rapid
degradation in a process which clearly deﬁnes the end of their usefulness (Fig. 5.25).
Maintaining a steady internal environment despite drastic external changes is an
important characteristic of healthy erythrocytes. In a human organism, each ery-
throcyte visits the lung capillaries approximately once per minute, releasing carbon
dioxide and protons (this is called the Haldane effect). The oxygen-rich environ-
ment of the lung increases the odds of encountering dangerous reactive compounds
(oxidative stress). By the same token, travelling through the acidic environment of
metabolically-active tissues alters the production and degradation rates of various
intermediate substances in key metabolic pathways. Of note is also the relative dif-
ference in temperatures—from 28 ◦C in lung tissue to 40 ◦C in certain areas of the
liver. In the kidneys, erythrocytes are subject to a rapid increase in osmolarity. Fi-
nally, the width of a typical erythrocyte is larger than the diameter of a capillary
which means that travelling through narrow capillaries causes friction and distorts
the cellular cytoskeleton. Counteracting all these changes requires the cell to expend
energy (in the form of ATP and its derivatives reduced by NAD and NADP).

Fig. 5.25 Basic metabolic pathways in human erythrocytes
ATP synthesis in human erythrocytes depends on glycolysis (Fig. 5.25). As
erythrocytes lack mitochondria, this process also produces excess lactic acid.
Regulation of glycolysis in erythrocytes is particularly susceptible to changes in pH.
Increased acidity inhibits the glycolysis initiator enzyme (phosphofructokinase-1)
as well as certain other allosteric enzymes: pyruvate kinase and hexokinase. Lower
efﬁciency of pyruvate kinase, as compared to phosphofructokinase-1, causes
more metabolic intermediates to ﬂow through the oxidative component of the
pentose-phosphate cycle. In addition, lower pH also reduces the intensity of the
Rapaport-Luebering cycle by inhibiting biphosphoglycerate mutase. Together, these
phenomena result in increased production of reducing equivalents, protecting the
cell from internal oxidation. This effect is particularly important given the relative
abundance of oxygen in erythrocytes travelling from the lungs to other tissues. It
ensures that iron is maintained at + 2 oxidation, prevents protein clumping and
reduces damage to biological membranes. It should be noted that old erythrocytes
exhibit slightly lower internal pH compared to younger cells.

Fig. 5.26 Average duration of life of erythrocytes in various animal species
The erythrocyte fulﬁlls a rigorous biological program which does not provide for
substantial freedom of action. It can be compared to a biological “robot” which does
not necessarily have to be called alive. Nevertheless, the erythrocyte can also be
said to possess some properties of life, most notably a “death trigger” (Fig. 5.26)
The abrupt cessation of biological function proves that cell death is not simply a
result of stacking internal damage, but instead results from a timer-like mechanism
which leads to programmed suicide. The need for such a mechanism is dictated by
the necessity of replacing senescent cells and controlling the degradation of cells
following their death. In humans, approximately 200 billion erythrocytes die each
day, releasing a substantial quantity of hemoglobin which could easily overwhelm
the organism’s compensatory mechanisms. Controlling the degradation of erythro-
cytes is therefore very important. Much like apoptosis, the process is biologically
programmed. In order to distinguish it from the death of eukaryotic cells, it has
been called eryptosis. It occurs as a result of osmotic or oxidative stress, or when
the cell cannot produce sufﬁcient energy to power its membrane pumps. Eryptosis
is characterized by an increase in the concentration of calcium ions. Only approx-
imately 0.06–0.4 % of erythrocytes suffer accidental (unprogrammed) death each
day, regardless of age.
According to the presented criteria, the erythrocyte—unlike viruses—may be
called a living entity because it performs its function automatically and is subject to
programmed death.
Scientiﬁc consensus holds that in eukaryotic cells senescence and death are
controlledbyamechanismwhichinvolvesprogressiveshorteningoftelomeres. How-
ever, erythrocytes lack chromosomes and must instead rely on a different process. It
is known that erythrocytes (including those stored in donor blood) progressively shed
fragments of their membranes. This phenomenon is most probably associated with
biologically-conditioned instabilities in certain areas of the membrane. It becomes

more rapid in an acidic environment and seems to correspond to increases in ambient
temperature. Damage sustained by the membrane lowers its active area and causes
loss of protein microvesicles. After a certain number of cycles spent carrying oxygen
from the lungs to other parts of the organism, the erythrocyte is no longer able to
perform the required metabolic actions during its brief stay in each of these tissues.
The maximum number of lung-tissue cycles is similar in most organisms.
The relation between the erythrocyte’s lifespan and the weight of the animal is
also fairly well known and enables us to derive a mathematical expression for its
longevity. Cyclical reductions in the cell’s surface area and volume eventually trig-
ger changes which turn the erythrocyte into a target for phages. As the cell sheds
fragments of its membrane, it also loses substances protecting it from being absorbed
by the reticuloendothelial system in the liver and spleen. The lower the number of
microvesicles in the membrane, the higher the concentration of certain integrated pro-
teins, which eventually begin to clump. Such protein aggregates are recognized by
immunoglobulins, resulting in the erythrocyte being removed from the bloodstream.
Aggregation of integrated proteins also impacts the activity of enzymes participating
in the cell’s energy management processes. An example is the AE1 protein, whose
aggregates inhibit certain glycolytic enzymes in senescent red blood cells. The same
protein also facilitates anion transduction—binding to enzymes renders it unable to
maintain a proper ion gradient inside the cell. Decreases in surface area affect the
overall shape of the cell and—consequently—the distribution of cytoskeletal pro-
teins. A dying erythrocyte is characterized by increased levels of phosphatidylserine
in the outer phospholipid membrane layer. This is a result of lowered availability
of ATP, which is required by enzymes responsible for moving this phospholipide
into the inner membrane layer (ﬂipases). A sudden increase in the concentration
of calcium ions, characteristic of eryptosis, activates an enzymatic protein called
scramblase, which also contributes to the exposure of phosphatidylserine. Together
both processes trigger mechanisms which degrade the aging cell and clear it from
the bloodstream.
Inhibition of any component of interlinked metabolic pathways results in
metabolicdysregulationwhichmayleadtocelldeath. Thistypeofprocessisobserved
in diseases which lower the expected lifespan of certain cells—hemolytic anemias
caused by deﬁciencies or inactivation of glycolytic enzymes; defective pentose-
phosphate cycles as well as cytoskeletal abnormalities and dysfunction of integral
proteins which constitute biological membranes. Figure 5.25 presents a simpliﬁed
diagram of erythrocyte metabolic pathways.
The mechanism which triggers erythrocyte death is speciﬁc to this group of cells,
proving the importance and universality of programmed death. It seems that protein
microvesicles perform the function of a biological clock. Once triggered, the death
process closely resembles apoptosis. Dead cells are removed from the bloodstream
by phages. It seems that while automation imparts biological structures with certain
properties of life, the true requirement of inclusion in the animate world is the
presence of a programmed death mechanism.
We can therefore conclude that a natural entity is alive if it exhibits autonomy
as a result of automatism and follows a programmed mechanism of action which
includes a timed death trigger.

Interrelationship In Organized Biological Systems
It is worth noting that living organisms make frequent use of clock-like mecha-
nisms. Such oscillators are usually based on negative feedback loops, but they also
involve positive feedback loops in order to ensure suitable signal properties. They
exploit speciﬁc biological phenomena as a means of measuring time, often with far-
reaching consequences. The ubiquitous nature of oscillators found in all types of cells
(including bacteria) seems to indicate the reliance of nature on cyclical processes.
The frequency of oscillations varies—from one cycle per second to one per day or
even one per year. In the human organism a particularly important task is performed
by the circadian rhythm controlled by a so-called master clock, which coordinates
the action of other systemic oscillators. Its development is closely linked to the evo-
lution of life on Earth, governed by the day-night cycle. The circadian rhythm works
by anticipating changes in activity associated with various parts of the day, which is
why the master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (NCS) is linked to the
retina through a dedicated neural pathway.
A different type of biological oscillator can be found inside cells. Intracellular
oscillators measure various frequencies (driven e.g. by changes in the activity of
glycolytic enzymes, calcium ion levels etc.) and exploit feedback loops which link
information stored in DNA to protein products. The master circadian clock seems to
be affected by cyclical changes in the activity of transcription factors (CLOCK and
BMAL-1) which, in turn, induce the transcription of repressors (Per and Cry pro-
teins); however the role of this mechanism is not precisely known. To-date research
suggests a connection between the action of oscillators and intracellular metabolic
pathways. The universality of this phenomenon may indicate the fundamental im-
portance of actively reinforcing certain biological processes, which—being subject
to automatic control—exhibit a natural tendency to slow down having reached a
preprogrammed level of activity.
Further research may bring an answer to the question whether oscillators are an
indispensable component of living organisms and whether their presence can be
included among the criteria of life.
