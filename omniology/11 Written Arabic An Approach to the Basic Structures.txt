INT R ODUCTION 
There already exist a number of manuals of Arabicfor English-speaking 
students, and it might well be thought that an addition to their number 
was hardly necessary. Teaching experience over some years, however, 
has suggested to me that there is a large and growing class of would-be 
students of Arabic for whom none of the existing works is well adapted: 
namely, those who aspire to a simple reading knowledge of present-day 
Arabic, as a tool for utilizing recent Arabic wrilings on their own particu-
lar discipline, whether this may be e.g. sociology, history, economics etc. 
h is not the primary purpose of such students to acquire an ability to write 
Arabic themselves, nor to read and appreciate a work of purely literary 
merit; yet at the same time they do need to comprehend what the Arabic 
writer is saying in as precise a manner as possible. 
At the moment, these students are confronted with a choice between 
two types of Arabic grammar. First, there is the traditionalist type, 
following the lines of European grammars of Arabic of the nineteenth 
century, which were themselves modelled on the approach to the language 
adopted by the Arab grammarians of the eighth century. The latter were, 
however, not concerned with teaching the basic structures of Arabic to 
those wholly ignorant of it, but with instilling an understanding of 
'correct' usage into those who already knew the language as a mother 
tongue. The task of acquiring Arabic from a manual of this sort is an 
extremely burdensome one; the student is required to master an enormous 
mass of grammatical detail before he can construe even two lines of the 
sort of text which the class of students I have described above aim at 
reading, and many abandon the attempt in despair, either through bore-
dom at this painful initial stage, or simply through lack of time to devote 
to it. By this approach, moreover, the student has forced upon him a mass 
of knowledge which will in the end tum out to be irrelevant and useless to 
him for his own particular purposes, however essential it may be for one 
who aims at becoming an Arabic scholar capable of writing the language 
and reading the literary monuments of the past. 
A second type of available Arabic grammar does indeed concentrate 
on the modem written language, often by a 'direct' approach, but tends 
to be slanted exclusively towards newspaper style. Such grammars omit 
a great deal of information which is required for the precise and scientific 
comprehension of serious and refleclive writing on abstract subjects. 

INTRODlICTION 
In auempting to steer a middle course between these two extremes, 
I have tried to elicit the basic principles which govern Arabic sentence 
structure, and to make them intelligible to the English speaker, and to add 
to this a sufficiency of grammatical detail, at the same time eliminating, or 
only slightly alluding to, features irrelevant to the main obj~t of the 
users I have in mind. Nevertheless, I hope it may be possible for those 
with more extended objectives also to use this work as a first introduction 
to the languagei for it is manifest that the earlier a student gains some 
basic reading ability, the easier it will be for him afterwards to acquire the 
finer points. It must be clearly understood that anyone aiming eventually 
at writing the language and reading the great works of the Arab literary 
past, will need to supplement this work by the use of other, more con-
ventional manuals. 
One result of this economy, and the most revolutionary of them, is the 
scant attention paid to the variable terminations of words (the so-called 
i'rab). In existing grammars of all types, this has normally been presented 
as a fundamental feature of the language, described in the very earliest 
chapters. It is much to be doubted whether this is in fact the case. Many 
Arabic speakers are able to comprehend the language as usually written, 
and yet would have difficuhy in giving the text its correct j'rah through-
out; evidently therefore their comprehension is achieved without much 
reliance on the i'rab; and whatever may have been the case in the sixth 
and seventh centuries, it is probable that since the end of the. eighth 
century this has been a linguistic phenomenon of which the application 
depends on a previous comprehension of the text and not the other way 
round. In any case, since a large part of the j'rab phenomena consist of 
short vowels, which are not shown in the written fonn of the language as 
customarily printed, a full and exact knowledge of these phenomena is 
virtually useless for the student who merely wishes to read ordinary 
printed material. Moreover, the student who begins by learning to 
recognize the function of a word in the sentence by means of its i'rab, as 
is suggested in the available manuals, will find himself encountering an 
almost insuperable barrier when he tries to make the transition from the 
fully vowelled specimens of the language in the grammar books to the 
unvowelled texts of everyday life. 
It is for this reason that the policy has been adopted here of employing 
vowelling as little as possible, in principle only at the first occurrence of 
a word, or where it is necessary to distinguish between twO words with 
identical consonantal shape when quoted in isolation from a context 
which would show which one is meant; and no attention is paid to the 
variable short vowel terminations which occur in nouns, adjectives 
INTR ODlICT I ON 
3 
and imperfect verbs, throughout chapters I to 12. At rne same time, this 
policy has not been adhered to with pedantic rigidity, and some short 
vowels are described even when irrelevant to the main purpose of the 
book: either because such a description is inextricably linked with the 
description of features which do appear in the ordinarily written shape 
of the word (for instance, it is necessary to give an account of the func-
tional principles which govern the use of the forms ahu, uhi and aha, and 
it would consequently be of lin Ie advantage to omit reference to the fact 
that similar vocalic variations occur in the short vowels at the end of 
orner nouns); or in certain small details, the omission of which would not 
appreciably lighten the leamer's task (for example, it would be absurd to 
leave the reader under the impression that the final syllables of la/uun and 
biltim were pronounced identically, even though he will nowhere see the 
difference marked in ordinary texts). 
Since this work is addressed to mature students, who will wish to 
pursue their own rhythms of learning rather than to be tied down to a 
fixed timetable, I have made no attempt to divide the material equally into 
'lessons' designed to occupy a stated amount of learning time; the user 
should spend as much or as little time on each chapter as he needs. Some 
explanation is called for, however, of the method adopted in the arrange-
ment of the material. The phenomena of Arabic grammar interlock to 
such an extent that it is virtually impossible to devise a wholly scientific 
arrangement of watertight compartments; whatever grammatical topic 
one broaches, one almost always finds that it cannot be fully illustrated 
without reference to some orner topic, and it therefore becomes a matter 
of arbitrary choice which topic is dealt with first. My overall principle has 
been to devote chapters to the main phenomena of sentence Structure 
(such as verbs, qualifying clauses, conditionals etc.), and to insert the less 
significant features wherever seems most convenient, mitigating the 
effects of this rather arbitrary arrangement by fairly liberal cross-
referenCing. 
No exercise material is included, for two reasons. Firstly, there is the 
vocabulary problem. Arabic has a fundamental vocabulary of somewhere 
around a thousand words which will be essential for all users of the 
language; but above that level one begins to enter into a sphere where the 
choice of requisite vocabulary is governed by the discipline in which the 
student is interested: many words which are basic for an economist will 
be useless for the historian, and vice versa. To insert exercise material 
adapted to anyone diSCipline would vitiate the usefulness of the book to 
those concerned with another discipline. Ideally, what is needed is not 
one body of exercise material, but a set of parallel texts dealing with 

4 
I NTRODUCTION 
various subjects. The preparation of such a sel, however, is hampered 
by the present lack of adequate word-counts for Arabic. The only 
attempt available up to now which is of any use at all is J. M.l.anclau's 
lPord COlUlt of modern A rabic prose (New York, 19S9), and even this is 
only useful in eliciting the very commonest words in Arabic, and cannot 
be used for the construction of a specialist vocabulary of any kind. 
Computer techniques are required for this purpose, and although several 
experts are engaged on the study of the application of these to Arabic, the 
problems involved are still far from solved. 
A second reason is that it is highly desirable that the student should at 
the earliest possible moment move on to work on the actual texts which 
he desires to read. While therefore a certain amount of 'illustrative' 
material additional to what is actually included here would no doubt be 
desirable, if the vocabulary difficulty mentioned above could be over-
come, this should only be used to ensure comprelltfuwn of the principles 
enunciated in the book*; the actual training in the application of those 
principles is preferably done by analysis of a chosen original Arabic work 
on the selected discipline, with constant reference back to this book, and 
with constant practice in the use of a dictionary. It needs hardly to be said 
that the latter practice should begin at the earliest possible moment; the 
sole dictionary of any use in this connection is Wehr's Dictionary of 
Modern Wriuen Arahie, in the English venion by J. M, Cowan. 
Naturally, no description of a language can avoid the use of a gram-
matical terminology. This is always a difficult problem, and particularly 
so when one is dealing with a non-European language, for which the 
conventional European terminology is usually quite unsuitable. So far as 
Arabic is concerned, almost all its linguistic phenomena fall into cate-
gories which do not correspond happily to European grammatical 
categories, and the use of conventional European terminology is conse-
quently liable to mislead, There is indeed a set of Arabic grammatical 
terms which have been evolved by the Arab grammarians for the exact 
description of their language; but one hesitates to burden the beginner's 
memory with a set of strange sounding words which will be useful only 
in the COntext of grammatical description, at a time when he is necessarily 
striving to memorize the basic general vocabulary. With some reluctance, 
therefore, I have felt obliged to devise a set of terms specially for this 
book, My aim in this has been purely pragmatic: to keep them to a 
minimum required by the nature of the book, and to make them as nearly 
as possible self-explanatory in the sense of being easily remembered once 
~e booklet of historical ph ... seology issued conclllttntiy with this work is a preliminary 
tentative in thi' di~on. 
INTRODUCTION 
, 
the initial definition has been read. Neither the terms themselves, nor the 
definitions, are intended to have a wider relevance outside the immediate 
purposes of the book. 
The conventions of Arabic script are so intimately bound up with 
Arabic grammatical structure that it is not possible to omit from a 
grammatical sketch some account of the script. At the same time, the 
learning of a script is a task of a different kind from that of learning 
linguistiC structure. The section here devoted to the script has to be 
regarded more in the light of preliminary notes, and of a background 
sketch to which reference can be made in the grammatical part, than as an 
autonomous learning tool: for since I suppose hardly any European would 
be prepared to undertake the learning of Arabic script by an exclusively 
visual approach (such as could be appropriate to the learning of Chinese 
ideograms), this part of the leamer's task inevitably involves either con-
tact with a native speaker or the use of tape recordings.· 
"A Harvard rcsearcll learn has ncendy investigated the application of methods of 
'programmed' leaming to Arabic script (J. B. Carroll and G. Leonard, TJ" 
'ff«tiv,~," of 
progrQ.mm,J 'GrafJri/s' in tetUAing lA, ArtJ!N& writi~11 'ystun, Labontory for reseaceh in 
instruction, Graduate School of Education, Harvard, 19<'3)' The report explicitly describes 
itself as a 'tentative' final version; but the only criticism of it thai suggests itself i, dlat die 
order of the present2tion of the Arabic leiters i. not correlated with the similarities in their 
written shapes; and any student who can obtain ac:c:es.s to this programme logelher with ill 
accompanying I:olpe recordings would probably lind it most helpful. 

GRAMMATICAL TERMINOLOGY 
SENTENCE. A word or group of words constiruting a complete and 
satisfactory communication. 
PHRASE. A group of words haVing its own internal strucrure and 
autonomy but not constituting a sentence. 
CLAUSE. A word or group of words which in itself would be capable of 
being a sentence, but is used in a context where it functions only as one 
element in a larger sentence. 
ENTITY TERM. A word or phrase which presents an object of thought 
to the hearer but without making any statement about it: 'John', 'John's 
house' and 'the revolutionary policies which the present government is 
bent on pursuing' are all entity·terms. 
PREDICATE. A statement made about an entity.term. 
THEME. An entity·term about which a predicate is stated. 
NOUN. One type of entity·term consisting of a single word which 
overtly describes what is intended, such as 'table' or 'centralization'. 
NOUN OF SINGLE APPLICATION. A noun which, as between 
speaker and hearer, is assumed to be applicable only to one precisely 
identifiable individual entity, such as 'John', 'London'. 
NOUN OF MULTIPLE APPLICATION. A noun which in itself is 
applicable to a variety of individuals within a category of similarly named 
entities, such as 'house', 'departure'; the hearer's ability to appreciate 
the individual reference of a noun of multiple application may be the 
result of its contextual placing, or it may be irrelevant to the nature of 
the communication [§I : 2]. 
PRONOUN. A surrogate or 'shorthand' for an entity-term, of such 
a nature that the overt entity. term to which it refers is assumed to be 
detectable by the hearer: 'I' will be understood to refer to the speaker, 
'you' to the person addressed, while 'he', 'she', 'it' and 'they' assume that 
the user is capable, if challenged, of pointing to the overt entity.tenn for 
which they stand. The same applies to the associated forms 'me', 'my' etc. 
DEMONSTRATIVE. An entity·term which is a surrogate for the 
gesture of pointing, as in 'give me that', 'these laughed and those frowned'. 
However, a demonstrative is normally capable of being explained by an 
6 
GRAMMATICAL TERMINOLOGY 
7 
overt entity.term, and its function therefore differs only marginally 
from that of a pronoun. 
QUAUFIER. A word or phrase attached to a noun, with the function of 
giving a more ample description of the emity envisaged than the noun 
itself, without qualifier, would have been capable of conveying; it can be 
another noun, or an adjective, or a qualifying clause, or a prepositional 
phrase (see below). 
ADJECTIVE. A Single word which functions either as a qualifier [Q a 
noun (English examples are 'Mad:. book', 'rolling stone'), or as a predicate. 
It is not, however, possible to give a linguistically adequate definition of 
the Arabic adjective in purely functional terms; all that can be said is 
that some qualifiers behave structurally in the manner described in 
§I : 13 and are then classed as nouns, while others behave in a different 
manner, as described in§l: II, and are then termed adjectives. 
VERB. A single word, being one of a set of distinctive patterns of word 
formation, and combining within itself the functions of a predicate and 
a pronoun theme. This set is subdivided into two parallel sub-sets 
termed PERFECT and IMPERFECT, but these sub-sets are not 'tenses' in the 
European sense, since their functions are much wider than that of simply 
conveying distinctions of time (as is the case with the English differentia· 
tion between 'he works' and 'he worked'); see §3 : 19. 
VERBAL ABSTRACT. A special type of noun which expresses the 
underlying concept of a verb, abstracted from all the ideas of time, 
theme etc. which are implicit in the verb; as in English the verbal abstract 
in '{qye knows no frontiers' contrasts with the verb in 'we {qye Mary'. 
PARTICIPLE. A single word, being one of a set of distinctive patterns 
of word fonnation, functioning either as a noun or as an adjective, and 
having a sense which bears a stable relationship to a verb, as described in 
§8 , 6. 
AGENT. The immediate theme of a verb predicate, not necessarily 
identical with the theme of the whole sentence. 
FUNCTIONAL. A word which, being neither an entity·term nor an 
adjective nor a verb, signifies relationships between the entity.terms and 
verbs of the sentence. 
PREPOSITION. A single functional word placed immediately before 
an entity· term, together with which it constitutes a PREPOSITIONAL 
PHRASE, and having the basic function of indicating relationships between 
the entity· term and a predicate (as in English 'he arrived in London', 'he 
arrived from London'). Prepositional phrases can, however, serve as 

8 
GRAMMATICAL TERMINOLOGY 
qualifiers of nouns provided that the latter subsume a predicate (as in 'his 
arrival from London'), and in certain other situations dealt with in 
chapter 15. 
OBJECT. An element in the sentence having the same relationship to a 
verb as a qualifier does to a noun, namely that of giving a more ample 
descriplion of what is intended than the verb alone could: 'drinks wine'. 
'drinks waler', 'sits on a chair', 'sits on the floor' are predicates with a 
greater degree of precision than 'drinks', 'sits', in the same way that 
'black book', 'John's house' are more precise than the nouns 'book', 
'house'. Objects are termed INDIRECT when they consist of a prepositional 
phrase, i.e. when the relationship between the entiry~tenn and the verb is 
indicated by a preposition; or DIRECT when they consist of an entity-
term alone without the intervention of a preposition. Both these types of 
object involve the participation of some entity-term extraneous to the 
agent of the verb. 
INTERNAL OBJECT. A word or phrase which amplifies the idea con-
veyed by the verb, but without involving the participation of any entity 
extraneous to the agent, other than the verbal abstract of that verb: in 
'John smiled a bitter smile', no entity is involved extraneous to 'John' and 
the fact of his smiling. 
VERBAL SENTENCE STRUCTURE. One in which nothing other 
than a functional precedes the verb. 
THEMATIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE. One in which, in principle, 
the theme of the statement occupies the initial position after any intro-
ductory functional; in some cases, however, this position may be occupied 
by some other element in the sentence (such as a prepositional phrase) 
provided that this is not a verb. 
NOUN CLAUSE. A clause which functions in the sentence in the same 
way as a verbal abstract: 'that he will depart' functions in the sentence 
'I anticipate that he will depart' in the same way as the verbal abstract 
'his departure' in the sentence 'I anticipate his departure'. 
CONDmONAL SENTENCE. One consisting of two clauses, which 
stand to each other in such a relationship that the validity of the proposi-
tion Stated in the principal clause is conditioned by the validity or other-
wise of the conditioning clause. In 'If you do that, I shall despise you', 
the statement 'I shan despise you' is a conditioned one which will only be 
effectively valid provided that the proposition stated in the conditioning 
clause 'you do that' is effectively realized, and failing this, the statement 
made in the principal clause will not be valid. 
GRAMMAT I CAL TERM I NOLOGY 
9 
HYPOTHETICAL SENTENCE. One of the same structural nature as 
a conditional sentence, differing from it only in that the probability of 
the effective realization of the twO propositions is presented as remoter 
and more speculative. 
ANTI-CONDmONAL CLAUSE. One embodying a proposition of 
which the effective realization does not condition the validity of the 
principal proposition, as in 'even if you do this, I shaH despise you', 
which implies that the statement 'I shall despise you' is a valid one 
irrespective of whether the proposition 'you do this' is realized or not. 

THE A R A B IC SC RIPT 
§S: 1. A'J.bic is '\Vl'itten from right to left. 
§S: 1. The alphabet consists (apart from its nrst letter, alif, on which 
So'C bcl!)w) of letters which are all consonants; but two of them, wandy, 
so'rve a double purpose, being sometimes consonants and sometimes used 
I" (Icnore long vowels u and I, 
§S :), Short .vowels, if indicated at all, are indicated by marks placed 
;IOove ?r below the consonant which precedes them in pronunciation. 
,There IS a further mark for a 'zero vowel', that is to say, to indicate the 
situation where the consonant is not follo~ed by any vowel-. In ordinary 
usage, these marks are rarely written, and the reader is left to guess from 
such 'un vocalized' script what the actual pronunciation of the word is. 
§S: 4· The script is a cursive one, in which nonnally the letters of a 
single :rord are linked together by 'ligatures' as in English handwriting, 
For thiS purpose, the functionals Ii, hi, ka, wa,/a and la are treated as jf 
they were part of the following word; so too is the 'article' (§t : I]. 
§S: 5· There are nevertheless six letters [§S: I2J which are not liga-
tured to the following leuer in the word; consequently a word made up 
wholly of these letters will appear (as in the case of the printed fonn of 
European languages) with each letter written separately. 
§.S : 6. The alphabet contains a number of pairs and groups of letters 
which, although they originally had distinctive forms, have come in the 
ev?lution of the script to have identical linear shapes. These are distin-
gUished by dots above or below the basic linear form of the letter. Such 
dots are an integral part of the letter. 
§S : 7· A doubled letter is not writterLtwice: doubled pronunciation 
of a consonant is marked by a special sign placed over it. Many typo_ 
graphers, however, will omit the doubling mark just as one normally 
omits the short-vowel signs. 
§S : 8., The Arabic phonetic system includes a sound (the glottal stop, 
Gennan Vokalanstoss') called hamr, which is from the point of view of 
th~ structure of the language a fully functioning consonant; and it was 
th~s ,sound that the letter a/i[ (the first letter of the Arabic alphabet) 
orlgmally denoted. But for historical reasons, ali/has ceased to have that 
~e exigencie! of t:(pogl"/lphy have, however, led in ~m 
years to a tendency towards

function and come instead to be the notation for the long vowel ii. The 
, 
consonantal sound hamr is consequently denoted by a mark called ha"'{a 
placed, "like a short-vowel mark, above or below the Hne of script. 
§S : 9. 'Transliteration' is the practice of using Lati~ scrip~ instead ?f 
Arabic script for rendering the language. Apart from l IS obvIOUS use In 
European works about the Arabic world, for giving the reader who 
knows no Arabic some idea of the sound intended, it can be used as a mere 
typographical expedient to avoid the difficulty and expense of Arabic 
printing, in works addressed to readers familiar with Arabic and capab~e 
themselves of reconstituting the Arabic script form. Since many ArabiC 
sounds are wholly unlike those of English or other European languages, 
a transliteration addressed to readers who know no Arabic can only be a 
very vague approximation phonetically; but for ~he ~ond purp.ose 
described above it is possible to use an exact transliteration wluch alms 
primarily at indicating the Arabic script form and not the sound, and this 
is what is employed in most manuals of Arabic grammar. In order to learn 
the actual sounds intended, one must have recourse to a speaker (or tape-
recording), or to a descriptive work such as W. H . . T. Gairdner's 
Phonetics of Arahic. Unfortunately, there are a number of different systems 
of transliteration current, and an Arabic word may appear in a great 
variety of differing forms in various Europea? language works. For the 
present purpose, a system is adopted which has some measure of ge.neral 
acceptance in English works ~bou t Arabic. The second to twenty-elgluh 
leuers of the Arabic alphabet have, in this transliteration, the following 
conventional order: b tthj }:ikhd dh rzs sh ~ c;I t~' ghfqkl mn h 
w y. When necessary, the hatn{a is transliterated as '. 
§S : 10. Printed Arabic is based (with a few modifications for ~~­
graphical convenience) on a manuscript style known as nas.KJ:' W,hl~l IS 
the Arabic equivalent of 'copperplate'. Everyday handwrmng IS m a 
different style, called ruq'a, of which a full analysis is given in T. F. 
Mitchell's Writing Arahic (London, 195), reprinted 1958). But a learner 
is best advised to begin by familiarizing himself with the naslch and 
printed style. 
§S : II. The six letters which are not joined to a succeeding letter 
[§S: s] are alif, i, dh, r, {, w. The forms of these, of die short vowel a~d 
the zero-vowel marks, and of the doubling mark [§S : 7}, are shown 10 
the Script Tables 1-) . 
§S: n . While the vowel mark for i is properly ~Iaced belo,: the 
consonant, many typographers will, for typographical conveme~ce, 
place it immediately below the doubling mark when the precedmg 
consonant is doubled (Table )). 
• 

THE ARABIC SCRIPT 
§S : I J. TIle basic letter forms of the other twenty-two consonants 
may be regarded as those which occur at the beginning of a word, or 
after one of the six letters mentioned in §S : I I; the combination / + alif 
has however a special shape (Table 4). In traditional script, initial h, t, 
tit, n, y frequendy have their 'hook' inverted when they precede 6, j, 
kit or m (Table 8); but this feature is not imitated on the Arabic type_ 
writer, nor in some printed founts. 
§S: 14· When one of these twenty-two letters is joined both to the 
preceding letter and to the following one, the following points should be 
noted: 
(a) the ligature is in most cases attached to the base of the succeeding 
letter (Table 5); 
(h) however, the ligature from a preceding letter to rand r joins 
the tops of these two letters, contrasting with d and dh which rise after the 
ligature (Tables 4,5); 
(c) in the traditional style, the ligature from a previous letter should 
be brought over the cop of 6,j, Idt and m, so as to join their top left-hand 
extremity; and many Arabic founts imitate this (Table 6). But other 
founts, and the Arabic typewriter, use the initial forms of these letters 
Iigatured at their right-hand angle to the preceding letter (Table 7); 
(d) ',glt and It in this position have forms differing from those used 
initially (Table 8). 
§S : 15· At the end of a word, twenty of these twenty-two letters (the 
exceptions being, and {) take on special forms, mostly charncterized by 
a 'tail' of various shapes (Table 10). Note particularly that the final form 
of k has a mark inside it which resembles the Iuu1l{a mark (S : 8 and 
Table II), bUI must not be confused with it. Finaly, being unlike any 
other letter, can and usually does dispense with its charncteristic dots 
(Table II ) . 
§S : 16. When one of these twenty letters occurs at the end of a word 
and is preceded by one of the six unligatured letters, their forms are 
(except. for n) combinations of the initial form with the final 'tail', as 
shown m Table 12. 
§S : 17· A final n with twO dots placed over it (and always preceded by 
the vowel a) indicates a pronunciation which fluctuates between -at and 
-a [§§. , 8, '4]. 
§S : 18. The namja sign is in certain cases written above the central line 
of script with nothing on the line of script vertically level with it; but more 
often it is 'supported' by a consonantal symbol on the line of script. This 
symbol may be a/if, w, or aywritten without its dots. The choice between 
these possibilities depends on complex rules associated with the vocalic

pal tern of the word; and there is a good deal of fluctuation o~usa~e in this 
matter. However, at the beginning of the word, the nam(a sIgn IS always 
supported by aliJ, and is placed above the alif when the following vow~1 
is a or u, below it when the following vowel is i. The vowel mark IS 
written further away from the line of script than the nam{a (Table IJ). 
§S : 19· There is some reluctance to write two alift side by side. 
Consequently at the beginning of a word the sequence ham~ + ii is 
denoted by a Single vertical aliJ, and a second one placed hOrlZontall.y 
above it. Equally, the sequence hamr + a + hami + consonant IS 
converted intO the sequence Itanl{ + ii + consonant written in the 
same way (Table 14). 
§S : 1.0. In the middle of a word, the sequence a + nam{ + ii is also 
custOmarily wlitten with a horizontal alifover the vertical one, the nam{a 
being then dispensed with (Table IS)· 
§S : 1. t. With [he sequence ii + nal1l{ + ii in the middle of a word, or 
ii + !ramj + any vowel at the end of a word, it is custOmary nowadays 
to write aliffollowedby a namra without support; but some nineteenth-
century typographers used the horizontal alifin these cases (Table 16). 
§S : 1.1.. Arabic does not tOlerate a word beginning with a vowel pure 
and simple; every word begins with either !ram{ or another c~n~o nant 
(the same phenomenon can be heard in the rigorous pronunciation ~f 
standard German, 'Buhnendeutsch'). Equally, it has a reluctance to admit 
an unvowelled consonant" as an initial sound (i.e. an initial consonant 
cluster). In a limited number of cases, therefore, where the first consonant 
of the word is in principle unvowelled, it is necessary, in order to make 
the word pronounceable in isolation, to prefix a vowel 10 it, and this in 
tum entails prefixing ham{ to that vowel·. A word like rlmiini 'twO' is 
regarded by the Arabs as unpronounceable at the beginning .of a,~ ut~er: 
ance and it must take on an initial vowel and hami, becommg u!rnam. 
§S: ZJ. When such forms are preceded by another word in the sen-
tence, they no longer need the helping vowel and its nam{: for if ~le 
preceding word ends in a vowel, the unvowelled initial of the follo~tng 
word forms a syllable with the preceding final vowel, and the syllabtfica-
tion of the juncture qiila + tnniini is qa.-latn-na.-ni; if the preceding word 
would normally end in zero vowel, a vowel is conventionally inserted. 
But the spelling of such words continues to reflect the pronunciation of!t 
in isolation, inasmuch as the initial alif which supports the namra IS 
retained; at the same time, the actual pronunciation is indicated, in full 
vocalization, by the substitution of a 'juncture' mark (wa,la) for the

Ir.am{a and its vowel, thus showing that these two phenomena are not in 
fact present even though the (IIi/has been retained (Table 17)·' 
§S : 1.4. There are a number of words ending in -0, in which the length 
of the if vowel is denoted not by alifbut by y (Table J8). This occurs 
only at the end of the word, and should the word. receive any additional 
terminal element, the spelling of the if reverts to the normal one with alif. 
§S : 25. In some very frequently occurring words, the notation of 
length of ii is omitted altogether by convention (though ifit is desired 10 
show this explicitly in fuU vowel marking, it can be done by writing a 
small vertical aliJin place of the short a mark). This spelling is invariably 
used in the word Alliih (see also §I ; 7); almost always in demonstratives 
[§§1.: I, 18: 6]; and frequently in the numeral 'three', tlza/atlz- and its 
associated forms, and in some names such as Sulayman, Isgaq etc. 
(Table 19). 
§S : :16. Doubling of the vowel mark at the end of a word is used for 
the notation of a terminal -n following the vowel and having a special 
grammatical function [§13 : 111; an a/if which follows a mark of this kind 
does not denote vowel length, but is a purely conventional spelling 
(Table :10). In the case of the u mark, it is traditional for me cwo symbols 
to be placed inversely in relation to each other (Table :10, first example); 
bur some typographers replace this doubled mark by a symbol illustrated 
in §13 : I I in the example 'a man came'. Another instance in which ali/is 
purely conventional and does not represent a phonetic reality is men-
tioned in §3: 15. 
§S : :17. There are a certain number of anomalous spellings, of which 
the following are the most likely to be encountered: 
(i) mi'a(t) 'hundred' is normally spelt Wilh an unpronounced a/if 
after the m; though this convention is often disregarded when it is 
preceded by a unit numeral, as in 'six hundred' [§18: 15]' 
(ii) the word 'hilran 'then/ in that case' can be speJt either with the 
consonant n or with the doubled a mark followed by a/if as described in 
§S : :16 (Table :10). 
(iii) the word for 'son' basically begins with an unvoweJled conso-
nant and behaves according to the principles stated in §§S : :1:1, :13, having 
normally an initial a/if. But when it occurs between twO names in the 
formula 'so-and-so son of so-and-so', the ali/is conventionally omitted 
(Table :11). 
§S : :18. Arabic numerals are written with the highest digit on the left 
and the unit digit on the right (Table :1:1). 
°In the chlpl~rs which follow, an initial ali/withoul the Aam{Q mark is of this nalUre. 
THE ARABIC SCR I PT

§S : :19. Punctuation has never been standardized in Arabic, and many 
hooks still follow the practice of medieval manuscripts in having no 
punctuation at all apart from the paragraph division. When punctuation 
is used, it is often used in so unsystematic a manner as to be little help ~ 
a guide to sentence structure. Both round brackets and quote marks will 
sometimes be encountered having not their normal European function 
of marking parentheses and quotations, but as a device to overcome the 
absence of capital letters in Arabic script, particularly with European 
words and names. A question mark is sometimes used in COntexts where 
European usage demands the exclamation. 
Seript Tahlelll 
In the following script tables, the first line of Arabic script is in 
traditional naslch style, with the vocalization and other marks which 
indicate fully the pronunciation; the second line is in normal print style, 
without the vowel markings, as will be encountered in ordinary book 
printing.

NOUNS AN D ADJ EC TI VES 
§ I ; I. An Arabic noun of multiple application can have placed before 
it an element 'ai, conventionally termed the 'article', and a noun with 
the article is said to be 'defined', The article has two quite distinct func-
tions, and only the context will indicate which is the appropriate one in 
any given case: 
(a) it may indicate that the individual entity intended is known to 
the hearer, either by reason of having been previously mentioned, or by 
the factors of the situation in which the statement is made, In this case it 
corresponds to English 'the'. 
(h) it may indicate that the noun is to be taken as applying to any 
and every individual of the category named or to the category as a whole. 
In this case, English usage fluctuates between 'a', 'the' and absence of 
both, as in 'a king bears heavy responsibilities', 'the elephant never forgets', 
'man is mortal', In all these cases, Arabic uses the article, and in order to 
achieve an idiomatic translation it is essential to recognize this use of the 
article where it occurs and select the appropriate English form, by possibly 
rendering the article as 'a' or omitting it altogether. 
§r ::1. An undefined noun of multiple application does not have the 
article in front ofit, and implies some unspecified individual or individuals 
of the category named, the identity of which is not previously known [0 
the hearer, as in 'John caught afislr', 'a lorry crashed into the side of the 
house', 'some drun/cs rolled by'. 
§r : 3. In some contexts, the undefined noun emphasizes the distinction 
between singular and plural, as in ~:... 'one king'; !J..,,:t.. 'several 
k;ng;'; i;'" 'one day'; i l::! '"ve~l daY'" 
§ r : 4, When a noun begins with one of the consonants pronounced 
with the tip of the tongue, the I of the article changes in pronunciation to 
that consonant; the initial consonant of the noun can then be written with 
the mark of doubling, yet at the same time the I continues to be written 
though not pronounced: '(.)""U i pronounced 'awuis '(the) men', 
' 4 
NOUNS AND AD'ECTIVES 
§I : 5. The vowel a of the article is present merely to avoid the occur-
rence of an initial consonant cluster (§S : 221; when another word precedes 
it the vowel is not required and both it and the hatrl{ cease to be pro-
n~unced, nevertheless the alif remains"in conventional spelling [~. : :13]., 
An exception to this general rule is the case ~here the ?re~It1~n It 
(§S : 41 precedes the article, in which case the alif of the article IS omitted 
in spelling. There is therefore a contraSt between V U ~ hi-nniis 'by 
the men' and vt:JJ li-nnas 'for the men'. 
§I : 6. Nouns beginning with I, when preceded, by both the,article and 
the preposition Ii, are written both without the a,lifand also ~Ithout th~ I 
of the article. Consequently, only the doubling mark, If used, WIll 
distinguish between L.'~ li-/isan 'for a tongue' and L.'\--U 
li.llistIn 'for the tongue'. 
, 
§I : 7, Some nouns of single application have by convenllon the 
article in front of them, such as J ~\ 
'Iraq', but this is a matter of 
stereotyped expression, and all nouns of single application ~re by their 
nature defined irrespective of whether or not they conventionally have 
the article, Th~ initial syllable of Allah is the article, and is subject to the 
. \ 
. 
spelling rules stated in §§I : 4, 6: hence A.U 'God' but 4lJl lilltIlr [§S : :15] 
'for God', 
, 
§ I : 8. A large number of nouns have an ending .a(t~, of which ~e t IS 
only pronounced in certain circumstances [§I: 14], belOg Otherwise not 
pronounced [§S: 17], as in U J; ~ dawla(t) 'realm', But if a termination 
is added to such a word, the t is pronounced and is then spelt with a 
normal t, as in ~ 
'J; ~ dawlall'my realm' [§:1 : 16]. 
§I : 9. Arabic nouns are grammatically either ~culine or feminine, 
A majority of feminine nouns have the ~~t) 7ndl~g; neverth7less, the 
differentiation between masculine and femmme IS neuher exclUSively one 
of meaning nor exclusively one of form. All nouns denoting male 
persons are masculine, although a few of them have the -a(t) ending, such 
as d;; _~ 
'caliph', All nouns denoting female persons are feminine, 
", 
. 

26 
NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES 
;ndud;ngsome wh;ch do not hoveohe -a(,) end;ng, such" • i I 'moth,,'. 
Further, there are a few nouns denoting things and noc persons, which are 
grammatically feminine although devoid of the -aCt) ending, the com-, 
monest being '-;'~ 'war'; J\':) 'house'; ..L: 'hand'; ~JI 
.. 
~
. 
'earth'; ~ 
Q I 'soul/self'; and a few which may be treated either as 
masculine or feminine, such as J l>- 'state/ condition'. 
§I : 10. When a noun by itself is inadequate to describe the entity 
term intended, one or more qualifiers may be added. A qualifier can be 
anyone of four things: an adjective, another entity term (noun, pronoun 
or demonstrative), a qualifying clause, or a prepositional phrase. Except 
in the case of the qualifying prepositional phrase, the qualified noun 
invariably precedes its qualifier or qualifiers. 
§ t : II. The adjective adapts itself to the noun which it qualifies in two 
ways. It takes the -aCt) ending when the qualified noun is grammatically 
feminine: hence, ~jk \,"i-! 'a long day'; J.:, ~ 
~t:; 
'a violent effect'; ~.."b ~ L.. '3 long hour'; OJ.:...L.::, '-;'? 
'a violent war'. Secondly, the qualifying adjective must itself have the 
article when it qualifies a noun which is defined in any way: \,.):11 
Jpl 'me long d,y'; o..\:..I.!JI ~.)-I 'me v;olent wo,'; 
4;:-.. _...LAJ1 L..-,..> 'ancient Rome' (this noun being grammatically 
feminine, and also defined by its nature, see §I : 7). 
§I : n. A noun followed by another entity term which serves as 
qualifier to it is said to be 'annexed' to the qualifying term; and the starns 
of annexed noun has important grammatical consequences. In 3 phrase of 
this nature, the qualifying noun corresponds to the English forms with 
apostrophe's or with prefixed 'of', as in 'Rome's glory' or 'the glory of 
Rome'; but such phrases in Arabic are indivisible compounds (resembling 
for example German compound nouns like Staatsminisrer 'minister of 
State') and cannot have anything inserted between them as is possible in

English: 'Rome's ancient glory'. An adjective which qualifies an annexed 
noun must therefore be placed after the qualifying entity term: ~ 
(...AAJI \.0).) 'Rome's .ndent glory'. 
§I : '3, Phrases consisting of annexed noun plus qualifying enti t~ te.rm 
have their status as defined or undefined marked only by the quallfymg 
term, and the annexed noun itself never has the article. If me qualifying 
term is an undefined noun of multiple application, then the phrase as a 
whole, and the annexed noun, is grammatically undefined; if it is a noun 
of multiple application made defined by the article, or a noun of single 
application, or a defined entity term of any other kind, then the phrase as 
a whole, and me annexed noun, is defined. Hence ..I j)1 L. .;' !

common after negatives [§9: w]. 
§I : 19. A qualifying noun can also be placed after an adjective, serving 
to define and limit the range of applicability of the adjective. A qualifying 
noun used in this way is always defined in form, bur does not thereby 
make the annexed adjective defined, and if the structure of the sentence 
requires the adjective to be defined, the article must be added to the 
adjective in the same way as if the qualifying noun were not present

used also as a noun meaning 'negro'; l>J W) as an adjective means 
'French', but can also be a noun meaning 'Frenchman'; d

be determined by the structure of the sentence, inasmuch as an adjectival 
use can only be present when the word qualifies apreceding noun [§r : ro],

in which the plural is an independent word formation and not directly 
related to the singular by the simple addition of a termination (compare 
English 'man- men' contrasted with the usual plural formations like 
'book-books'). Patterns of broken plurals show a great variety, and the 
broken plural of a given noun must normally be learned separately ftom 
the dictionary. Some examples of broken plurals have already been cited:

B AS I C THE MAT I C SENTENCE 
§2. : I. Arabic demonstratives are entity-terms, defined in their own 
nature, and capable of standing alone as such: 
\ ' I 
' I 
....l.:A (masculine), 0 ~ 
(feminine) 
'this (person)/ this (thing), 
's'II ' 
- s"I -
~ 
,:, (masculine), ~ 
(feminine) 
'that (person)/ that (thing)' 
[§S : 25]' Where English uses demonstratives as adjectives, as in 'this 
minister', 'that day', Arabic treats the nouns as explanatory additions to 
the demonstrative entity term: such nouns must be nouns of multiple 
application carrying the article, and are placed after the demonstrative, 
< 
as in ..J .. j )1 IJ.A 'this minister', 0 ~I ~ 
'that woman', oJ.A 
~..,)-I 'this war', \~ i ~~ 
'that day'. The plural demOnstra-
tives apply only to persons and are the same for both masculine and 
" ' <I 
, 
, 
, '\ .. ," \ 
feminine: !::: l P 
these persons', 
So ~ 
~ 
lJ 
·'those 
women'. 
§2 : 2. It has earlier been noticed [§r : 1 r] that a qualifying adjective 
carries the same mark of definition or indefinition as the noun which it 
qualifies. This principle is specially important, because if an adjective 
following a defined noun does not have the article, it ceases to be a 
qualifier and becomes a predicate. Whereas "-",,L:S:JI \~ 
...u ...cJ-1 'this new book' is an entity term phrase, "-"" t:5:J1 1 J.A 
.. ~ 
. 
. 
...u...l>- is a complete sentence conveying the statement 'this book is 
-
' 
new'.

§2.: 3. Similarly, an undefined entity term placed after a defined one is 
a predicate, and the two together constitute a statement: ~ 
lJ.A 
'this is a king'; ~? 
So & ~~ 'that is a strange thing'; 
4JJ':' ..I .. jJ .J..;! • ~ 
'Muhammad's uncle is a minister ofstate'. 
It is precisely the transition from defined to undefined status that marks 
the boundary between the entity-term which is the theme under discus-
sion and the predicate stating what it is. 
§2. : 4. If a noun following a demonstrative is defined in any other way 
than by itself having the article [§2. : 11, e.g. by being a noun of single 
application and so defined by its own nature [§I : 7], or by being annexed 
to a defined entity-term [§I : 13], then this tOO is a predicate: .JJ!. I J.A 
'this is Muhammad'; 4JJ ...u1 ..I .. j J lJ.A 'this is the minister of 
state'. 
§2 : 5. When a defined noun or noun phrase of the nature JUSt des-
cribed is required to function as explanatory addition to a demonstrative, 
the order of the two elements is reversed: IJ.A ~ 
'this Muhammad'; 
oJ.A ..J j)1 ~~ 
'this policy of the minister'.

§2 : 6. Arabic usage does not permit pronouns to receive qualifiers of 
any kind. An adjective or an entity term, irrespective of whether defined 
or undefined, which follows a pronoun, is a predicate. The following are 
therefore all unambiguously statemenrs:

according to the principle of§ , : 24' ~' 
§2 : 7. Statements of the kind just described provide a mechanism for 
the expression of communications involving a defined predicate. The 
theme is followed by a statement caSt in the form of pronoun plus predi-

these expressions would be taken to mean 'king Solomon', 'the responsible

such that no reasonable ambiguity could arise, as for example if\......,f

§:1 : 9. Prepositional phrases, consisting ofa preposition followed by an 
entity-term, also frequently function as predicates, and when one en-
counters a defined emity-term followed by a prepositional phrase, there 
is a distinct possibility that the fonner is a theme and the latter a 
predicate: 4.1 ~ 
..1 .. j'; I 'the minister is in the house', 
.1 .. j)1 J\A..o j Ih 'this is in the minister's speech'. 
§:1 : 10. Prepositional phrases can indeed, as mentioned above, function 
as qualifiers to a noun [§J : 10], but this is largely restricted to cases where 
the qualified noun is a participle, a verbal abstract, or some other abstract 
noun having a close association with a verb. All these freely take after 
them as qualifiers the same prepositional phrases as would be appropriate 
after the corresponding verb (but it should be remembered that qualifying 
prepositional phrases, unlike other qualifiers, occaSionally precede the 
qualified noun, §I : 10 and see §IO: 10). Because the verb 'wish' in 
Arabic requires the preposition cJ after it, one can also, using the verbal 
abstract,write Ih j ~I ¥.J'theking'swishforthis'. 
§2.! I I. It follows therefore that the status of a prepositional phrase 
will often be ambiguous, and it will not be at first sight clear whether it 
functions as a qualifier of a preceding entity-term, or as a predicate to it. 
Only the presence or absence of a subsequent predicate will resolve this 
ambiguity and make it clear which function the prepositional phrase has . 
If llA j ~I ¥.J is a complete sentence, then the preposi-
tional phrase must be a predicate, and the meaning is 'the king's wish is 
fo, this'; but in -..I.;J..::. 11.>. j ~I ~.J the presence of 
the subsequent predicate o~D 
indicates that the prepositional phrase 
is a qualifier, and the meaning is 'the king's wish for this is extreme'. 
§2; 12. When the theme of a statement is an undefined noun and its 
predicate is a prepositional phrase, the order of the two elements is 
reversed, the prepositional phrase coming first in the sentence: I h j

§2 : r 4. A sentence structure of this kind, using the preposition Ii (or 
occasionally ~ ...L..:.J;.), is the regular way of expressing in Arabic ideas 
involving the English verb 'have': ij ~ 
..r:::: ~ 
'(there is 
a large house to the prince = ) the prince has a large house'. In the case of 
this idiom, the placing of the prepositional phrase first is normal even 
when the other member of the sentence is a defined term: ("",....I ~

• 
\~ J A-.. ~ -...Lj)'\ ~ 
'the Arabs have the virtue of

obligation; the prepositions used are ~

§2: 16. Pronouns, being merely substitutes for nouns, can like nouns 
be used as qualifiers; 'his house' is an allusive substitute for 'the house of 
so-and-so (some identifiable individual),. But when so used, they have 
different forms from those listed above [§2 : 6], and take the form of 
elements attached to the end of the qualified noun and written as one 
word with it. T he forms are -I 'my', -lUi 'our', -.ta 'your' (addressed to a 
single male), -ki 'your' (to a single female), -kum 'your' (TO several 
males), -kunna 'your' (to several females), -hu 'his' (or 'its' if the noun 
alluded to is non-personal but grammatically masculine), -hii 'her' (or 
'its' if the noun alluded to is non-personal but grammatically feminine, or 
'their' if the noun alluded to is a non-personal plural [§l : 24]), -hum 
'their' (male persons), -hunna 'their' (female persons), If the qualified 
noun ends in a long vowel or -ay, the pronoun qualifier -l is changed 
into -ya; if it ends in -i, -lor -y, the forms -hu -hum -hunna become -hi 
-him -hinna, Thus, ~ 
'my house'; t> L:.:..... 'my meaning' [§S : 24]; 
• ~ 
L.t.:..o 'their meanings'. 
§2: 17. In prepositional phrases where the entity term is a pronoun, 
the latter has forms which in the main resemble those used as qualifiers of 
nouns, but they combine with the preposition in certain specialized ways: 
(i) the prepositions ~

change their ii to ay before pronouns: I, ' - 1- _

§2 : 20. The basic thematic sentence structure implies in itself no 
definite time indication, and will be found in various contexts alluding to 
past, present or future time. 
3 
THE VERB 
§3 : I . The sentence structures described in chapter 2 consist of twO 
separate and clearly re<:ognizable elements, theme and predicate. The 
Arabic verb, however, is an amalgam of several meaningful elements 
combining in one word both a predicate and a pronoun constituting a 
theme of the predicate, as well as indications of time and modality 
associated with the predicate and conveyed by a differentiation between 
twO sets of forms, the 'perfect' and 'imperfect'. 
§3 : 2. When the theme pronoun implied in the verb alludes to the 
speaker or person addressed, the theme is fully intelligible, and a single 
word can thus constitute a full sentence: expressions like 'I smile', 'you 
smiled' are in Arabic single words which may themselves be full sen-
tences. This is equally the case when the implied theme pronoun alludes 
to a person or thing (or persons or things) extraneous to the speaker and 
person addressed, provided that the noun to which the pronoun alludes 
is clear from the context: the Arabic verbs meaning 'she died', 'it failed' 
can be full sentences provided that the entity terms alluded to by 'she' 
and 'it' are clear from the context. If this is not the case, then it is neces-
sary to add an overt entity term to clarify the theme pronoun implied in 
the verb. This entity term may precede or follow the verb, When it 
precedes, it functions as a theme and the verb is a predicate-clause in 
which the implied pronoun alludes back to the overt theme; consequently 
a sentence like • ~L.. O~ \1\ 'the princess, (she) died' is a struc-
ture parallel to the one described in §2 : 7, ~ 
I r ~ 
'Solomon, (he) is the king'. When the overt entity-term follows the 
verb, it is a clarificatory addition explaining the allusion of the pronoun 
implied in the verb: O~ \11 ~L.. 'she died. (namely) the princess', 
§3 : 3, It must however be appreciated that when a theme has been 
enunciated and followed by a verbal predicate clause, the pronoun which 
alludes back to the theme may be found anywhere in the predicate 
clause, and is not ne<:essarily the pronoun implied in the verb, since the 
39 

T HE VERB 
latter may have its own clarificatory entity-term explaining the agent 
• 
pronoun impli~d in th~ v~rb: \.g:...ol ~L.. O~ 
~\ is 'th~ mother 
of the princess died' (it has to be analysed as 'me princess-she died, 
namely, her mother'). 
§J : 4· Whereas European languages envisage the verb as a predicate 
stating an event which involves the agent, many Arabic verb forms are 
descriptive in their nature, with an emphasis on what the agent is rather 
than on what it does, and are therefore congruous in sense with an 
adjective predicate of the kind mentioned in chapter z. Hence, for the 
communication 'its meaning is clear' one may find the predicate in verbal 
form~ as C:',a . ':! ~ l:..:.va or 0 l:..:.va 
~ 
~ with adjective predicate. 
.. 
C: ,4 ';' !, as well as 
§J : 5· Every Arabic verb and noun is theoretically derivable from a 
'root' consisting of consonants only. In me great majority of cases me 
root is three consonants, though there is a handful of nouns having only 
two consonants, like ...l: 'hand', and a certain number of four-consonant 
roots. The actual form of any given word is created by filling Out the 
rOOt consonants with vowels and sometimes additional consonants which 
are nOt part of the root. In order to describe the actually occurring word 
formations, it is customary to use the consonants J . t. . c,j as 
ciphers typifying the root consonants, and hence to say, for example, that 
l"",.)~ 'book', Jl:j 'battle', and Jl...> 'mountains' are all 
.

~ . 
of the 'pattern' J LJ. 
§J : 6. Arabic dictionaries list all nouns and verbs under these 
theoretical roots. Consequently, a noun like .ol:.--=... 'question', which 
is of the pattern a·· 4:., will be found in the dictionary under the 
' See §§3 : 8, 3 : '1 (v) for the e)tplan~tion of this verb form.

§J : 7· From the consonantal root can be derived a number of types of 
verb. These have been conventionally numbered I to X, an arrangement 
not entirely happy, but one which it is necessary for the learner to follow, 
because it is used in Wehr's dictionary. Type I consists of the roOt con-
sonants filled out by a vowel pattern in which the first vowel is a, the 
following consonant is unvoweJled in the imperfect, and the quality of the 
second vowel differs as between one verb and another; hence one has 
such varieties of pattern as

Dictionaries consequently cite the second vowel of both perfect and 
imperfect for T ype I verbs, commonly by giving in full the form of the 
perfect which implies the pronoun 'he', and putting after this the vowel 
which is the second vowel of the imperfect. The verbal abstract entity-
term corresponding to a T ypc I verb is also fluctuating in pattern, and 
this toO is usually given in dictionaries; Wehr places this item of in form a-
tion in brackets after the perfect and the second vowel of the imperfect. 
Other types of verb are constant in their patterns, so that if one is told 
that a verb is of Type V from a given root, one can automatically construct 
its forms and that of its corresponding verbal abstract. Wehr therefore 
indicates such forms simply by the numbering of the verb-type in bold 
roman figures, without further detail.

§3 : 9· The meanings of each of the verb types derived from a single 
root must be learned independently. Analysis of the meanings of the 
various verb types derived from one root will usually reveal some element 
of common meaning between them, but the actual sense of each type 
cannot be deduced and must be ascertained from the dictionary (just as in 
English, although 'overtake' and 'undertake' have both some relationship 
[Q the idea of 'take', the actual sense of these two verbs could not be 
discovered by a foreigner otherwise than from a dictionary). 
§J : 10. There are certain kinds of root where the application of the 
normal patterns of word formation is subject [Q modifications. These are 
principally (i) roots containing one or more of the 'weak' consonants 
wand y, (ii) 'doubled' roots, in which the second and third consonants

as if they were two-consonant ones, so that.) • .) • '-' precedes in the 
" 
alphabetical arrangement So • .J • '-' and ~ 
• .J . ej. 
§3 : II. The modifications to which such roots are subject in the forma-
tion of words can be stated in terms of rules, and the best account of 
these rules is to be found in R. Blachere's Eliments d'araDe classiq14e in 
the chapters devoted to 'Racines anormales'. But the rules are complicated, 
and since many of them affect only the vowel pattern of the word, they 
are of little help to a reader confronted only with unvocalized text. For 
the latter, the main points to be noted are that in some word forms the 
consonant w or y may be merged into a long vowel or eliminated com-
pletely from the written shape of the word; and that in the case of doubled 
roots, the second and third root consonants sometimes coalesce into a 
doubled consonant, which mayor may not (at the typographer's whim) 
be indicated by the mark of doubling. 
In the case of verbal abstracts from roots of this kind, twO very 
commonly occurring phenomena should be noted: (i) in the verbal 
abstract of Type IV and X verbs from roots having w or y as second 
consonant, the second root letter is merged into a long a, and the tennina-
. 
tion -aCt) is added; so that from root ~ .lS . J 
one has the Type IV 
verb - ~ \; i 'he benefitted/ infonned' and the Type X verb -~ \ 4.:.::., .... \ 
'he gained/ made use of', of which the verbal abstracts are respectively 
o~\;1 and o~\...4...::....wI ; (ii) the verbal abstracts of Type II verbs 
, 
-
from roots with w or y as tllird consonant have the pattern ~ 
, -
as in root lS .r ,~, Type II verb ~ 
'he named' [§J: 27]

show the same phenomenon, e.g. ~ .r.- 'he experienced', with verbal

THE VERB 
45 
§3 : 12. In addition to roots of the above mentioned kinds, certain 
other classes of root entail modifications of the normal word patterns, 
which can be Stated fairly simply: 
(i) when the first consonant of the root is one of the four letters 
rf ~ 
....k ...b. the W of the Type VIII verb becomes 
..b so that from root ~ 
• .) .,f one has a Type VITI verb 
'-:"'~' 6· .,; I 'he fel l into confusion'; from root t . J . ...b, Type 
VIII verb' ~I 
'he became cognizant'. 
(ii) when it is '::', the W of the Type VIII verb becomes ;) which 
coalesces with the ~ of the rOOt to give a doubled letter: from root 
\ . t.. . 
~ the Type VIII verb is -~ 
~ ~ I 'he supported himself'. 
. 
(iii) when it is ~ , the U of the Type VIII verb coalesces with it 
to produce either doubled ~ or doubled ,;: from root.J .!J . ~ the 
Type VIII verb is :;s-; ~ \ 
or :;S-;'; \ 'he remembered'. 
(iv) when it is ham{a. the latter is merged into a long vowel in the 
perfect of the Type IV verb and its corresponding verbal abstract: from 
root.J .0. ~ one has the Type IV verb ~T 
'he preferred' and the 
verbal abstract .J l~l 'preference'. 
(v) when it is J . this becomes U throughout the Type VIII 
verb: root 0 . j . J, Type VIII verbal abstract 0~1 'poise'. 
§3 : 13· There are hardly any true irregular verbs in Arabic, and the 
only ones likely to be encountered in ordinary reading are:

§J : 14. The implied pronouns in verb forms are indicated by va~jati~ns 
in the pattern of the word which i~ the perfect ~ffe~t the tenmnatlon 
only, but in the imperfect affect either the ~m?mg only or ~olh 
beginning and tennination of the word. These vananons are exempltfied 
for the perfect by:

§J ; 15. The final a/if which appears at the end of the -Ii termination is 
simply a convention of writing and is not pronounced. It is used only at 
the end of the word, and disappears if any further termination is added 
to the word. The same convention applies to all verb forms in which -u 
comes at the end of the word, provided that plurality is implied. 
§3 : 16. The variations in the beginning of the imperfect forms are 
consonants. The vowels which follow these consonants vary according 
to the verb type, as can be seen from the list in §J : 8. The imperfe<:ts 
corresponding to the perfect forms listed in §3 : 14 are:

§J : 17. An overt entity-tenn to which the pronoun implied in the verb 
alludes can [§J: l.] precede or follow the verb. If it precedes, then the 

48 
THE VERB 
verb takes on a pronoun form strictly adapted to the nature of the entity-
tenn, and is plural if the entity-term denotes persons, though the principle 
stated in §I : 24 continues to apply when it is non-personal. But if the 
verb precedes the clarificatory entity-tenn, the verb-fonn is always 
singular.

-J~I ~L.iJ1 0' ~L.iJ1 ..::.J~I "hewomendep""d'

lUI fo ',he re.;uhs .ppea<' 
§3 : 18. When the following clarificatory entity~term is grammatically 
feminine, the preceding verb is commonly feminine singular, but 
instances may occasionally be encountered in which it has the masculine 
form, particularly if other words intervene between the two: ~ fo 
-. 
l~ ~L::S:JI \~ if".;"' ~ 'there appear from 
the study of this book some important results'. On the other hand, the 
reader may occasionally encounter cases in which a noun denoting a 
precisely definable group of people has a feminine Singular verb: 
4.Ip ~Ul !J? I ..:..::..t;! 'ille Seljuk Tu,k, 
established a state'. 
It is furthermore normal for • ~ 
and ~ 
[§§I : 16, 17], when 
annexed to feminine entity-terms, to be themselves treated as feminine: 
"l-\J I ,,':1JA . ~ 
W ~ 
I 'all these women departed', 
~4 ... ,"," .. a.H ~ 
• ~b 
'certain difficulties arose'. 
§3 : 19· The sense differentiation between perfect and imperfect 
operates on three levels, and in various contexts anyone of these levels of 
differentiation may receive the main emphasis, overshadowing or virtually 
eliminating the others: 
(i) the perfect points to past time, the imperfect to present or future 
time, 
THE VERB 
49 
(ii) the perfect points to a single action, regarded as instantaneous 
in its occurrence, the imperfect to habitual or repeated action, or to one 
visualized as covering a space of time. 
(iii) the perfect points to a fact, the imperfect to a conceptual idea 
not necessarily realized in fact, and will often have to be rendered in 
English by 'can/ mightj mayj would/ should .. :. 
§3 : 20. In older Arabic, the perfect verb was sometimes used to 
convey an aspiration, but this is hardly ever encountered in modem 
writing outside a small range of stereotyped expressions, such as 
doll\ 
'~j 'may God have mercy on him' [§3: 25], used when 
mentioning a deceased Muslim. 
§3: 2.1." It can be made explicit that the imperfect is being used with 
reference to future time by placing $a~ or "' ~~ 
before it, though 
this is not necessary if the context sufficiently indicates futurity. 
~~ 
or ~J.j ~y 
means explicitly 'we shall go', 
whereas ~.l; alone is capable of also meaning, according to the 
requirements of the context, 'we are (now) going', 'we (habitually) go', 
'we could go', 'we might go', 'we were going', 'we used to go'. 
§3 : 2.2.. The perfect can intrinsically be used either as a narrative form 
detailing past events ('he died'), or descriptively to picture a situation 
arising from an anterior event ('he has died', or, in an appropriate con~ 
text, 'he had died'). Ifit is used descriptively, this can be made explicit by 
placing before it 0 J,j or • J.:AJ: ~ 
'we knew'; lo.L.:. ...L9 
'we have come to know' (descriptive of the present situation resulting 
from a previous accession of knowledge)·, 
§3 : 23, ...L9 placed before an imperfect reinforces the concepts of 
habituality or potentiality inherent in that form [§3: 19 (ii, iii)], In 
°The differentiation between the 'narrative' and the 'situational' use of the perfect cannot 
always be conveyed in English, We do distinguish between the nlrrative 'he died', 'il became 
clear' and the situational 'he had died', 'it was clea,.', but when an Arabic author might well 
wrile ~!, 4...Ak;.. "'a. Jj since this describes a siru3tion, we would normally 
write simply 'he controlled a wide area', 

THE VE R B 
English it may have to be rendered in this case by such terms as 'possibly / 
probably/ occasionally/ often' etc.: ~ 
~ 
'you may well think/ 
you will sometimes think' etc. 
§3 : 1.4· Just as the noun may require a qualifying expression to des-
cribe fully what is intended [§I : lO], the verb may require additional 
expressions in order to explain fully what is meant, in the shape of an 
object or objects, whether direct, indirect or internal. Arabic usage in this 
respect is highly idiomatic and careful attention must be paid to it: where 
an English verb requires a direct object the corresponding Arabic verb 
may require an indirect object and vice versa; and a verb followed by one 
preposition will often have a completely different meaning from the same 
verb used with another preposition or with a direct object. Wehr care-
fully records these usages. In Wehr, as in many other dictionaries, the 
letter form 0 is used as a conventional symbol for a personal direct 
object, A for a non-personal one. 
§3 : 1.5· If the entity-tenn which functions as direct object of a verb is 
a pronoun, the latter has the same form as it would have when functioning 
as qualifier to a noun [§1.: Hi], except that the pronoun form - l is in this 
• 
• 
case replaced by -nl: ~.)I 'he sent me'; .)t;.>-)'I l:.:A.4 'the 
reports reached us'; J' .. j)\ ~ 
'the minister wrote it'; Uf 
'I recognized him/ it'. In the perfect verb form terminating in -tum 
[§3 : 14] this becomes -tumu- before an object-pronoun: ~~ 
f 
'you (male persons) recognized her/ it/ them (non-personal)'. 
§3 : 26. A pronoun implicit in a verb, or an object pronoun or quali-
fying pronoun, or one attached to a preposition, can be specially 
emphasized by placing after it the corresponding pronoun form from the 
.

'I tell you'; \jl ~ 
'my house'; :.;t- \j~.J1 'they sent us'. 
§3 : 1.7· When a root has w or y as third consonant, the perfect verb 
form implying the pronoun 'he/ it (masculine), in all verb types other than 
T H E VER B 
T ype I merges the third root consonant into a long vowel-aspelt with 
(...$ if it comes at the end of the word, but with \ when object pronouns 
are added. The perfect verb form implying the pronoun 'she/ it (feminine)' 
• 
omits the third root letter altogether. From root '-.S . '"' .0 one has 
therefore the Type VIII verb forms ~4:.(j I 'he cho~', 0 LQ:..; I 'he 
. .. _ ... \ 
chose it', 
,,-_~,, 
__ , 'she chose'. The same is true of Type I verbs from 
such roots, with two exceptions: (i) when the third root consonant is w 
the masculine form is spelt with I, so that from root J .~ .,-:" one 
has 1-~ 
'he appeared',· W ~ ...G 'she appeared'; (ii) if the variable 
vowel of the Type I perfect is i, the third root consonant is retained as y, 
so from root J .~ . .) one has ~.J 
'he was coment', 
. ~~ 
J 'she was content'. 
§3 : 28. It will be noticed that the principles enunciated above will 
require the reader to distinguish between \j lQ:..i \ 'he chose us' and 
l:...A;:j' \ 
. .., 
, 
we chose. 
§3 : 29· One point that will be further elaborated later deserves a 
summary mention here. This is that direct object status of an undefined 
noun (and of an adjective which qualifies such a noun) is marked in 
certain circumstances by the addition of a terminal alif. One must distin-
• 
guish therefore between ~.) • Jl ~.) 1 'some man sent (a 
• 
message) to me' and ~.J • Jl ~.J I 'he sent a man to me'. 
§3 : 30. The relative placing of the agent entity-term and the direct 
object entity-tenn (not being a pronoun) after the verb is not governed 
by any strict rule; and the reader mUSt expect to encounter cases where the 
direct object term precedes the agent term, as well as vice versa (an 
example is given in §8: 18). 

4 
QUALIFYING CLAUSES AND 
SIMILAR STRUCTURES 
§4: I. A qualifying clause has the same function as an adjective, but 
does so by means of a structure which could in itself stand as a statement, 
and which in principle contains within itself a pronoun alluding to the 
qualified noun. When the qualified term is an undefined noun or un-
defined noun phrase, the simple juxtaposition of the clause to the qualified 
noun or phrase is sufficient to indicate the qualifying function of the 
clause. It can be assumed that in the vast majority of cases, if an undefined 
expression is immediately followed by a sentence structure containing a 
pronoun which alludes to it, the sentence Structure is a qualifying clause 
to that undefined expression; whereas in the type of sentence in which a 
clause functions as predicate [§§3 : 2, 3], the theme term is normally 
defined. Hence ~i ..:..;\.. op)ll is a full statement, with op)ll func-
tioning as theme and ~l ..:..;L. as its predicate, and means 'the princess' 
mother died'; whereas lyi ..:..;t,. opi is not a full statement, but an 
entity-term in which opi is a qualified noun and ~i ..:..;t,. a qualifying 
clause, and it means 'a princess whose mother died'. 
§4 : 2.. The pronoun, within a qualifying clause, which alludes to the 
qualified noun, is not neressarily overt, but may be implicit in a verb 
form: Ct:;:.!Il.>lY ~ ~ 
..t!.j.J 'a minister who has achieved success'. 
§4: 3· When the qualified noun or noun phrase is defined, the quali-
fying clause has exactly the same structure as in the case of an undefined 
qualified term, but its status as qualifying clause (and not as predicate) is 
marked by the insertion in front of the qualifying clause of ($ ill (when 
the qualified term is grammatically masculine), or ~ l (when the 
qualified term is a single female person or a gram~atically feminine non-
personal term or a non-personal plural), or ~ J.~.lJ1 (when the qualified 
term denotes male persons), or ~~1 (when the qualified term denotes 
female persons): C~ I ~ ~ 
J.jjl ~~j)1 'the ministers who have 
5' 
QU ALIFYING CLAUSES 
53 
achieved success'. The following structures should be studied; in the case 
of the thematic structures (0), (c) and (d) the boundary berween the 
theme and the predicate is indicated by the vertical line: 
(a) i ~1 t..~ ;'.~ .. ~! tl::.ll olA ~ l:..l...a- 'we have achieved these 
results for the benefit of the nation'. 
(h) i..,Al1 ~ 
~ 
l:..l...a- I tL-:.:JI o.1A 'these results we have 
achieved for the benefit of the nation'. 
(,) i .... 1 ...a I \d- u..,.. .$II 1£\::.11 • .i. 'these ,,,ults whkh we 
have achieved are for the benefit of the nation'. 
(J) i..,Al1 ~ 
~ 
l.:.l....:..> tl;j I olA 'these are some results which 
we have achieved for the benefit of the nation'. 
§4 : 4. The tS.il1 group of forms can also function as entity-terms in 
their own right, without a preceding noun; the singular forms tS.il1 JI 
may have either a personal or a non-personal implication: 
0..1.4;:...; ($..ul 'the thing which we believe' 
~ 
...L...:.<U J...ul 'the persons on whom we rely'. 
This group of forms is subject to the spelling convention described at the 
end of §I :~. Hence, ~ 
...L...:.<U J...il! 'for the persons on whom we 
rely'. 
§4: 5. Modern usage sanctions the use of demonstratives both in front 
of a noun qualified by an ($.ill etc. clause, and in front of the ($lJl forms 
when used without a qualified noun: 
~.rV Jl i1t1 ~ 'that woman whom you recognize' 
~ ~pi 
tS..ull!.ll~ 'that thing of which you informed 
them' 
§4 : 6. In lieu, however, of the use of the tSjjl etc. forms as entity-
terms in the manner described in §4 : 4 (but not when they are used as in 
§4: 3), one will very commonly find • ~ 
or \... These two words are 
differentiated in a way unlike those: whereas the ($jjl group distinguishes 
between masculine and feminine and between singular and plural, but 
does not distinguish in the singular between a personal and a non-
personal allusion, on the other hand;"" has a personal allusion and L. a 
non-personal one, but neither of them distinguishes whether the allusion 

QUALIFYING CLAUSES 
is to singular or plural, masculine or feminine. The type of allusion 
intended can, it is true, be made explicit by the nature of the pronoun 
within the clause: ~~ 
J....:...i ,f 'the (female) persons on whom we 
rely'. Nevertheless, it is extremely common to use a masculine singular 
pronoun within the clause referring to ;.... or Lo, irrespective of whether 
the allusion intended is to singular or plural, masculine or feminine. 
Consequently, ~ 
J....:...i ;.... is capable of meaning 'the person Or 
persons, male or female, on whom we rely', and ~ 
.J..:.oo.i l.o 'the thing 
or things, masculine Or feminine, on which we rely'. 
§4: 7· A further point of differentiation between the {.S..ill forms and 
';'/Lo is that the former always have defined status, whereas the latter 
may be either defined or undefined in sense, and may consequently imply 
either 'the person/thing ... who/which' or 'a person/ thing ... who/ 
which'. 
§4 : 8. There are twO structures in which it is permissive to omit the 
pronoun within the clause which refers back to the introductory (.S..iJI 
or ,f/ Lo : (i) when the pronoun functions within the clause as theme, the 
predicate of which is a prepositional phrase, as ~I J .r ,f or 
~I J if 'the person who is in the house'; (ii) when it functions as 
direct object of the verb in the clause, as o..LC:.U l.o or..LC:.U l.o 'the thing(s) 
which we believe'. 
§4 : 9· A specially frequent structure is the avoidance of a defined noun 
qualified by a clause introduced by (,$..iJI etc., and the employment, as an 
alternative, of a ~/Lo clause followed by the preposition .~ plus the 
plural of the category noun which in the English structure is the qualified 
term. Instead therefore of ~I ..:.....;s !.I...ill --!Jj)1 'the ministers to 
whom I have written' one will very commonly find ~I ..:.....;s ,;. 
--hj)I~; instead of ~i ~ 
JI .J~)I\ 'the reports which 
reached ~e yesterday', .JL;.~I rJ: ...,-oi ~ 
Lo. 
§4: 10. When the preposition J precedes Lo or ,f, the two are often 
written as one word: ..:r-! \c-!. The same is the case with the prepositions 
QUALIFYING CLAUSES 
rJ: and if, with the additional feature that the n of the preposition 
becomes m, hence ;: U ,;r Cr. 
§4: II. ~i (masculine) and ~i (feminine) 'whichever, whatever', 
with either personal or non-personal reference, can in principle function 
like ;""/ l.o, but are most commonly used in annexion to an entity-term, 
as in ~J ~."...... ~i ~ Jf->. 'he solved whatever difficulty occurred'; 
I.L. c:.,h~: ~! ~i v~ ..1,...,.:.oU 'we rely on whichever of them can do this'. 
§4 : 12. When l$..ill or ,;.. has reference to die speaker or person 
addressed, Arabic idiom often employs the corresponding pronoun 
within the clause following (contrary to English practice): 
I.L. ~ 
;.... ..:...; i 'you are a person who is able to do 
this' 
'I am the one whom all of them 
know' 

5 
CONNECTIVES 
§5 : I. Connectives link words, phrases or sentences in such a way that 
each of the connected members has precisely equal syntactic and functional 
status. The three basic Arabic connectives are J and w'and' [§S : 4], 
, , 
and ~ 
'and (subsequently)'. But the range of usage of J and ~ 
is much 
wider than that of English 'and', J will often be found in contexts where 
English would use a non-emphatic 'but' or 'or', And whereas J simply 
links two items without implication as to the priority of one over the 
other, .j implies that what precedes it has some sort of priority over 
what follows it; when the priority intended is one of time, ~ marks the 
independent stages in a sequence of events, as in :.r f.-j)l ~iU 
j..r-z.i t; + 
'the minister rose from his seat, and departed'. The 
priority can also, however, be one of logical sequence of the train of 
thought, and this can work in either of two ways: the mind can proceed 
from a cause to a consideration of its effect, and in this case W corresponds

T H EMAT I C SENTENCE FORMS AND NOUN CLAUSES 
§6 : I. Thematic sentence structures can be classified according to the 
nature of [he predicate, which can be: 
(i) a noun or adjective [§§:l. : 2, J], as in ~ 
1.h. 'this is difficult'; 
~J"-o'" o.h. 'this is a difficulty'. 
(ii) a prepositional phrase [§2 : 9], as in ~ 1 J .r..j)I'the minister 
is in the house'; ~-"""" 1.h. J 'there is a difficulty in this' (§:l.: 12). 
(iii) a clause in verbal sentence structure [§3 : 2], as in ~~ oF. "YI 
'the princess died'; '+oi ~lo 0F."Yl'the princess' mother died'. 
(iv) a secondary, emboxed, thematic sentence structure, as in 
..!..Ul1y. ~ 
[§:l. : 7} 'Solomon is the king', or in ~t; ~L:; ;""l:-llo.h. 
'the results of this policy are advantageous', where the primary theme is 
'this policy', while the predicate stated about it has the form of a clause 
consisting of a secondary theme ('its results') plus predicate (,are ad-
vantageous'). 
§6: 2. In connection with thematic sentences with clause predicates 
[§6: I (iii, iv)], it must be re-emphasized that the pronoun, in the predicate 
clause, referring to the theme, can occupy any position within that clause 
{§3: 3]. In particular, when that pronoun functions as direct object of the 
verb, English idiom requires the verb to be turned into the 'to be .•. -00 
by' structure: if the theme is 'this mosque' and the predicate stated about 
it is 'Umar built it', then the Arabic structure ./' o~ ~"';" . ~l\ I.h. 
requires to be rendered idiomatically in English by 'this mosque was 
built by Umar'. 
§6: 3. In the examples cited hitherto, the theme has been simply 
enunciated. But it is also possible to place in front of a thematic sentence 
structure one of a set of functional words: 
(i) -;"01, which perhaps had, in the pre-history of Arabic, the sense of 
• 
'behold' (and the Biblical 'behold the lilies of the field, they toil not' 
58 
THEMATIC SENTENCES, NOUN C LA USES 
59 
reproduces precisely the structure of an Arabic thematic sentence intro-
duced by -;" 0!). It is for this reason that, when the theme is a pronoun, the 
latter has the same form as a pronoun which functions as direct objeCT of 
a verb [§3 : 25]· Parallt:! TO ~ 
l5' 'she is beautiful' one finds also 
~ 
~l. T he pronouns'!' and 'we' after -01 have either the expected 
forms ~l G1 or abbreviated fonns u-?101. H owever, any special 
emphasis which might once have resided in the use of-01 has been com-
pletely lost in standard Arabic prose, and it cannot be said that ~ 
~l 
differs at all, in sense or emphasis, from ~ 
l5" When -01 is employed, 
the boundary between theme and predicate can optionally be marked by 
fa-: ~ 
I~ "-:"'!f>:- -01 'the answer to this is difficult'; 
I~ J -01 
~~ 
'there is a difficulty in this'. 
(ii) -;; ~ 
-~J are expanded forms of -;"01 and require to be 
followed by a thematic sentence structure in which the theme, if a 
pronoun, has the same form as after -01; like 0,JJ [§S : 4] they imply a 
fairly strong antithesis, 'but (emphatic)/ nevertheless'. 
(iii) (..f prefixed to a theme gives to it a certain degree of emphasis, 
and can be roughly equated with English 'as for'. After (..i the beginning 
of the predicate is marked by 0: ~ 
I.h. ~i 'as for this, it is difficult'. 
But ~i does not impart to a pronoun theme the object fonn as -01 does: 
hence, ~~ t:.:....l:-t :.I- ~i 'as for us, our policy is plain'. 
§6 : 4. Two further words resemble those described above, in that 
they immediately precede the theme of a thematic sentence structure, but 
they have an additional function in modifying the sense of the proposition 
stated in the sentence; both of them entail direct object status for the 
theme: 
(i) :OJ:"] adds an idea of dubiousness to the proposition: ~.J.J 
'perhaps it is correct'·. 
(ii) : - • J /..:..:J ~ converts the proposition into an aspiration instead 
'This functional is also sometimes placed before a clause implying a hope or fear, e.g. 'in 
the hope that perhaps .. :, 'for fear that perhaps . . :. 
,

THEMATIC SENTENCES, NOUN CLAUSES 
of a statement: t.:- ~ 
~ 'would that he were with us'; llA J.i .',:.>lo ~ 
'would that he had died before this'. 
§6 : 5. Noun clauses are marked as such by having :;"01 or "01 placed 
before them. -0i is followed by a thematic sentence structure, and 
resembles -01 in giving a pronoun theme the form of a direct object 
pronoun [§3 : 2S]; ·01 is followed by a verbal sentence structure. There are 
thus three possibilities: (i) -::0i plus theme; (ii) °01 plus perfect verb; 
(iii) °d plus imperfect verb. The differentiation between these three 
types of nOlln clause is that (i) and (ii) present the proposition stated in 
the clause as a fact, whereas (iii) presents it as a conceptual proposition 
not necessarily realized in fact, such as an aspiration, possibility etc, 
Hence, 
(i) r:::t=' 1...i.A ~0i:~ o,-;;o!l'l have become convinced (of the fact) 
that this is correct', 
(ii) i.r.ll..!..ll) J J!'"'11 -~J °01-~1 'it happened that the 
prince (in fact) arrived on that day', 
(iii) \~ ~ 
°0i A 
'it is possible that this may be true', 
(iii and ii) 4) ~i J!'"'jl ..rii °d ~f 
'my hope is that you 
may tell the prince that I have gone'. 
§6: 6. Noun clauses may be placed, like any other entity-term, after a 
preposition: 4) °01 -~ 
l.h -2) 'this occurred after I had gone' 
(equivalent to 'after my departure'). Nevertheless, when an °0f clause 
functions as indirect object of a verb, it is not uncommon to omit the 
preposition: in spite of the fact that the verb ~j 
in the sense of 'wish' 
requires an indirect object with J, and the preposition is indispensable 
for the meaning when the object is a noun, pronoun or demonstrative, as 
in ~~-) J ~.) 'he wished for my departure', yet one may find 
~) i °0, ~.) 'he wished that I would go'. Similarly, -01..!..ll) is 
commonly used rather than ~0~ ..!..Il) for 'that is because'. 
§6: 7. Theoretically, a noun-clause can in every case be replaced by a 
verbal abstract, and vice versa. There are, however, idiomatic preferences 
THE MATIC SEN TENCES, NOUN CLAUSES 
6, 
for one or the other structure, though these preferences do not coincide 
with English preferences. Hence an Arabic verbal abstract formulation 
will often need to be idiomatically rendered in English by a noun ~clause 
structure with 'that'; or an Arabic n oun ~clause structure by the English 
verbal abstract 'to do so-and-so', as in e.g. ~J.; 01 l:.:k ~ 
which is 
better rendered in English by 'it is impossible for us to go' than by the 
structure (felt in English to be more cumbrous) 'it is impossible for us 
that we should go'. 
§6: 8. The differentiation between facmal and conceptual noun 
clauses is of special significance in twO idioms common in modem Arabic, 
involving the use of a noun clause after "Yl 'except/ apart from' and 
uL&. 'on'. -0i '11 is analysable as 'apart from the fact that', and ~01 .y:-
'on top of the fact that; and both these forms should be rendered idio-
matically in English by 'Nevertheless'. °0i '11 followed by an imperfect 
verb is analysable as 'apart from the supposition that', and corresponds 
idiomatically to 'unless'; °0i .y:- followed by an imperfect verb as 'on the 
supposition that' and corresponds to 'provided that'. Hence: 
&' t.:..t,.-•• "i )ll} 
&' t.:..t,.- d (.>"-
'Nevertheless, 
ceeding' 
our policy is suc-
t:.:...~ ~ 
0i '11 'unless our policy succeeds' 
I;;;....~ ~ 
0i uL&. 'provided that our policy succeeds' 
§6: 9. There exists an alternative structure to the use of a noun clause 
after verbs denoting activities of the mind, such as thinking, believing 
etc., and the verb lSL 'see' when the 'seeing' is a mental activity and not a 
physical one. A similar alternation exists in English between the expres-
sions 'I believe that this is correct' and 'I believe this to be correct'. In 
Arabic, the proposition which is thought is expressed in the form of a 
thematic structure, of which the theme functions as direct object of the 
verb denoting thought, while its predicate may have any of the four 
types of predicate structure described in §6 : I. Parallel, therefore to the 
noun-clause structures 
wli ~l:-J I o~ -01 J.A.:.",; 'we believe that this policy is 
useful' 
,,-:,~1 ~ .!iii ~ >t 'I think that you are in the right' 

THEMAT I C SENTENCES, NOUN CLAUSES 
~.> J.i ~i 0~.J,:i;J 'she discovered that they had gone' 
the alternative structures are expressed as follows: 
w ti t...WI o..i.b...t.a:.u 'we believe this policy to be useful' 
",:",!,...zll ~ ~i '1 think you to be in the right' 
~.> J.i ri~J 'she discovered them to have gone' 
§6: 10. English sometimes uses 'it' referring forward to an entity-term 
occurring later in the sentence, as in 'it is possible that we may go', where 
'it' is definable as the proposition 'that we may go', since this is the 
concept about which the predicate 'is possible' is stated. Arabic uses the 
corresponding pronoun in the same way, when a thematic sentence 
structure is required. While it is possible to write simply ~ .li • 0i ~, 
where the noun-clause functions as clarificatory entity-term explaining 
the pronoun implied in the verb form ~, 
yet if it is desired to begin 
the sentence wim ;: 0! (which requires a thematic sentence structure after 
it), one will find ~ .li 0i ~w ~l. In addition, there are instances 
where the Arabic writer finds it inconvenient, for stylistic or rhetorical 
reasons, to accord his theme the first place in the sentence, and desires to 
postpone it to later in the sentence: in such cases, this pronoun serves as a 
generalized surrogate, at the beginning of the sentence, for the true theme 
which receives its overt expression later. Often, this usage is not repro-
duceable in English, and the pronoun must be left untransla)ed: e.g., 
~\.1j <,It. r-: ~ ",.ill ,-;,(;SJI J' 1.1. J!~ .:1 .tal 
\wJ~;(_ 1J J ';J.~ '1 believe that all writers, in whom there are lofty 
ambitions and far-reaching hopes of progress, attempt this'.

etc. in the imperfect [§3 : 16] are capable of being a true predicate in the 
sense of 'exist'. But this use is relatively rare, and in the great majority of 
cases this verb is a functional term which adds to the basic thematic 
sentence ideas of time and mocfality which the thematic sentence as such 
does nOt convey [§2 : 20]. The theme of the basic thematic sentence then 
becomes the theme of the verb 015"', while the predicate may be in any of 
the four standard forms [§6: IJ. Given the basic thematic structure

§7: 2 . If the predicate is a verbal clause [§6: I (iii)], the sentence as a 
whole naturally possesses already some time indication, and the addition 
of 015'" then modifies the time indication possessed by the predicate clause 
verb, by conveying that the unmodified thematic proposition was in the 
past a valid statement; the addition of 0;:"" that it will be in the future, or 
might be etc., a valid statement. The thematic structure Jl ~~ p')l1

either as true predicates, or as modifiers to a basic thematic sentence with 
the same structure as 01S' entails. Used in the latter way, one finds

§7: 9, It has already been emphasized [§§3 : 3, 6 : 21 that the entity-
term selected as the main theme of a communication is not necessarily 
identical with the agent of a verb which functions as predicate to that 
theme. 'The reports are reaching them' can be phrased either aSJt;>-~)l l 
~ 
or as Jl:>~1 ~ 
~ !. according to whether the principal 
topic of the communication is visualized as the reports or the recipients 

66 
MODIFICATIONS OF THE THEMA TI C SENTENCE 
of the reports. It follows therefore that when such a communication is 
modified by the use of one of these functional verb-forms, the agent of 
the functional verb is not necessarily the same as the agent of the predicate 
verb; the above mentioned structures, when modified by cr" i, will 
become ~

respectively, 
though in both cases the substance of the communication is 'the reports

VERB S OF VA GU E APPLI CATIO N; P A RTI CIPL E S 
§8: I . The verb forms which have hitherto been discussed carry with 
them a specific mention of the agent, or 'doer' of the action: both J~f 
'he (implying an already known individual) informed me' and J~l 
J!j)1 'the minister informed me' are struClures which state the identity 
of the informant, and are to that extent specific in their application. 
Parallel to these there exists a set of verb forms, distinguished by different 
vowel patterns, which do not state this identity but imply vaguely that 
'someone or something unspecified' is the agent. 
§8 : 2 . Verbs of vague application are characterized throughout all verb 
types by a vowel sequence u-i in the perfect and u-a in the imperfect. 
Thus:

Forms of vague application of Type IX verbs do not exist. It will be 
noticed that the imperfect form of vague application of a Type IV verb is 
indistinguishable from that of a Type I verb. 
§8 : 3. When the specific verb has a direct object, the corresponding 
verb of vague application varies in its form as if the direct object were the 
agent; the direct object functions in the sentence structure as a surrogate 

68 
V AG UE APP L ICATION AND P ARTICIPLES 
for the unmentioned agent. In this situation the verb form can be rendered 
by the English (so-called 'passive') 'to be ••• -ed' form: J;;...:.f 'he 
informed me' is parallelled by ::..:;.,:.f 'I have been informed' (by some-
one unspecified). 
§8 : 4. When the specific verb has only an indirect object, the latter 
remains unchanged after the corresponding verb of vague application, 
while the verb does not undergo any modifications adapting it to the 
nature of the object term, but retains invariably the masculine singular 
form (the structure being thus closely analogous with French 'on leur a 
ecrit'). While it is in some cases possible to render [his structure by an 
{,. 
~.-." 
English passive form, as in .Jr:l l o-AA if ~.. ! J.i 'these things 
may well be dispensed with', yet in other cases it may need a radical re-
phrasing in English: 
Specific 
~ 
.r..j)l ~~ 'the minister was satisfied with 
them' 
Vague 
'we desire some results' 
'satisfaction was felt with them' 
'there is a desire for some results' 
§8 : 5. In the vague form of Type I verbs from roots having w or y as 
second consonant, the latter is merged in the perfect into f and in the 
imperfect into a: root J .J .J, specific Jli 'he said' J~ 'he says', 
-
, 
vague J::' 'jt has been said', J~ 'it is said'. The form ~ J J~ followed 
by a surrogate agent is an idiomatic expression corresponding to English 
'called' or 'named', as in Uti U Jti. ,;l,.! 'a woman named Fatima'. 
§8 : 6. The participle is a recognizable word pattern which is primarily 
an entity-term associated with a verb, and connoting the agent of the 
verbal idea but without adding any other information about that agent. 
The participle form associated with the verb ~ 
~ 
means simply 
'writer', that is, an entity definable solely by the statement 'he writes' or 
'he has written' and carries no further information about the entity. 
Consequently, ~\SJ \ is congruous in meaning with ~ 
lS-U\ or 
~ 
lS-U1 'the person who wrote/ writes', and ~~ 
with ~ 
~ 
or ~ 
if 'a person who has written/ writes'.

§8 : 8. In the word pattern ~l.i from roots with w or y as second

J .J .J the ~ \j pattern is ~li. Such forms are therefore indistin-
guishable from the ~\j pattern from a root with ham{Q as second 
consonant, as in JL. (J ." . ...,...) 'enquirer'. 
§8 : 9. Participial word patterns have however secondary functions in 
addition to being entity-terms as described in §8 : 6. All of them can be 
freely used as adjectives; and a good many can also be employed as nouns 
with a specialized sense, not merely the generalized sense of the agent of 
the verb. For example, the verb ~ 
~ 
(with an indirect object 
introduced by the preposition -~) means 'he/ it combined/ gathered/ 
united', and the corresponding participial pattern can be: 
(i) an entity-term meaning simply 'something which unites', as in

~-,-!, 
§8: 12. The Structures involving the use of these patterns need careful 
attention, as they are sometimes of a nature very unfamiliar to users of 
European languages. On the basis of what has been said [§8 : 6], it will 
be appreciated that '-!~ is congruous in sense with ~ 
t... 'a 
thing which somebody writes' or 'something in writing'; and can also 
have [§8 : 9] secondary functions, as an adjective as in ~~ o,;,ul 'a 
written communication', and as a noun with the specialized sense 'letter'. 
§8: I). This principle extends to the verb of vague application which 
has only an indirect object. On the basis of the structure I.L. J ~-; 
'there is a desire for this', there arises the clause Structure 4.} ~-; t... 
'a thing for which there is a desire', and this generates the participial 
structure 4.} o....;y.../' which, when functioning as an entity-term, has the 
same sense as the clause structure. 
§8: 14· The adjectival use of the participle associated with a verb of 
vague application is modelled closely on the verbal use, to the extent that, 
just as the verb of vague application with an indirect object does not 
undergo modification adapting it to the nature of a feminine object term 
[§8 : 4], so in the participial structure generated therefrom the participle 
does not take a feminine form even when the noun which it qualifies or to 
which it serves as predicate is feminine or plural. The following examples, 
showing how the participial Slruct'Ures are generated, should be carefully 
studied:

§8: IS. The para!leiism between participial Structure and qualifying 
clause structure is carried further than this. In English, a qualifying clause 
can be rephrased as a participle structure only provided that the agent of 
Ihe verb in the clause is identical with the qualified noun, as is the case with 
'the policy which coordinates our actions' which can be rephrased as 'the 
policy coordinating our actions'. This limitation is not present in Arabic, 
and in principle any qualifying clause can be rephrased as a participial 
structure even when the clause has a verb with an agent different from the 
. qualified noun. Here again, we encounter the feature that the form of the 
participle is modelled on the form of the verb in the clause Structure, and 
is not adapted to the nature of the noun qualified by the participle.

§8 : 18. Since the differentiation between a verb of specific application 
and one of vague application very often resides simply in a difference of 
short vowels, the beginner reading unvocalized material will often face a 
problem in deciding which is intended. Here again (as with the case of 
the amhiguiry over the status of a prepositional phrase mentioned in 
§2 : II) the overall structure of the sentence is the deciding factor. When 
a verb is of such a nature that it implies the participation of two entities, 
then it can only have a spedfic application if either the sentence itself or 
the context in which it is placed mentions two entities: if mention is made 
of only one, then the reader must assume that the other entity is unmen-
tioned and that the verb is a form of vague application, Take the following 
example: 
.~ 
,
. ~ 
,
~ 
~ 
u,..ul .!.l\i cl ,,:,..;JI L.>"' ~ 
J..lJ1 U"'.....,..JII ~ 
J'i 
mentions two entities, and the verb is therefore of specific application, 
and the sentence is capable (according to contextual likelihood) of 
standing for either 'the robbers who attacked the village on that night 
killed some of them' or 'some of them killed the robbers who attacked 
the village on that night'; but if ~ 
~ 
is a complete seOlence, then 
it may represent 'he killed some of them' provided that the cOOlext 
suggestS the participation of a previously mentioned 'he' in the action, 
but if this is nOt so then the verb must be assumed to be of vague applica-
tion, and the statement represents 'some of them were killed',

NEGATIVES 
§9 : I. One form of negativing a proposition has been mentioned 
above [§7 : 3], but there are a number of other negative functionals, 
L. is used to negative factual propositions, and is hence the appropriate 
negative for the perfect, particularly when used as a narrative form, as in 
~ 
L. 'he did not write'; and for the imperfect when this denotes the 
immediate present, as in ~i 
L. 'I am not at the moment writing', 
~ is used to negative general or conceptual propositions, and is therefore 
appropriate for the imperfect denoting future time, or the durative or 
habitual present, or any of its modal aspects, as in ~ 
~ 'he does not 
(habitually) write', 'he willJshouldJ mightJmay JcouldJcannot write',

§9 ; 2, 01 combined with ; is often written as )' 1; ~ 
)' ~ 
l.u 'it is necessary that we should not neglect this', 
§9 : 3, L. can also be used to negative propositions in the basic thematic 
structure, and, like ~ 
[§7 : 4], it can be followed by a noun or adjective 
predicate with the preposition hi: l:;.....~ o.u L. or l:;.....~ o.u L. 'this 
is not our policy', 
§9 : 4· The negative • ~ is always followed immediately by an 
imperfect verb, which then assumes the range of meaning otherwise 
associated with the perfect; the sense implied is very commonly that of 
a perfect employed as a descriptive fonn f§3 : 22], Hence the negative of 
~.1 .u 'he has gone' is commonly ~~ r 
'he has not gone', 
§9 : 5, ~ is also used with an immediately following noun, together 
with which it constitutes a sentence structure, having the sense 'there is 
no ".': l.u J ~~ 'j 'there is no doubt about this', A common 
. , 
instance of this usage is the expression ~ ~ 'there is no avoidance', 
employed idiomatically for English 'inevitably': l.u ,jp.; ~ 'j 81 'we

inevitably admit this', As is the case with the basic thematic sentence 
[§2 : 20], this structure has no inherent time limitation. 
§9 ; 6. Anorher common usage is that of ~l 'except' after a negative, 
and such sentences are sometimes best rendered in English by the 
affirmative form with 'only': 1..i.A ~1 ~i '1 'I know only this', 
§9 : 7· Negatived forms of .lIS'"" [§7 : 5] are also idiomatic; they 
connote stricdy 'almost not', but should be rendered in English by the 
affirmative Conn with 'hardly': \.1.6 ~ 
.)tS:; "Y 'we hardly under-
stand this'. Negatived fonns of .>l&, [§,: 7] imply 'no longer': .lis. L. 
J ) J)' 'he no longer visited me', 
§9 : 8. ;..;s. is essentially a noun used nonnally in annexion to a noun 
or adjective, and has the sense of 'other than', but the following usages 
should be noted: 
(i) when annexed to an adjective, it negatives the sense of the 
adjective. In older usage, the defined or undefined status of the phrase 
is marked by the presence or absence of the article with the adjective: 
~ I ff ~L..l I 0..iA 
'these unimportant problems' 
~ 
ff if WI olA 
'these problems are unimportant' 
~ 
ff Jl-o 
'some unimportant problems' 
But many modem writers prefix the anide to .If:- as well when it is 
required to have defined sratus: 
.. .

0.)) ~ I .r.iJ1 .ua.I...JI 0...lA 
'this unlimited authority' 
(ii) when annexed to a pronoun (with the form of a pronoun used 
as noun qualifier [§:z.: 16]), it should be rendered 'other(s), with omission 
of the pronoun: 
lAffJ JWI olA 
'these and other questions' 
offJ ..r..j}! 
'the minister and others' 
(iii) when annexed to an undefined singular noun, it negatives the 
concept of unity implicit in the noun [§J : 3], and muSt be rendered 
'several': 015::' J 'in one place'; 0~ .;f J 'in several places'. 
(iv) after a negative, it behaves like 'Yl [§9 : 6]:

NEGATIV ES 
7! 
(v) when annexed to a noun clause introduced by :: 0i it Similarly 
has the same force as )11 [§6: 8], so that ~0t ff like ~0; 'Yl means 
'Nevertheless, •. .', 'However, .. .' or simply 'But, .• .'. 
(vi) its use otherwise than annexed is virtually confined to the 
expression ff '1 (or ff ~ ) . placed after a proposition or phrase, and 
meaning 'solely': ff '1 I..iA r- 'he knows solely this'. 
§9 : 9. ff annexed to any en t ity~tenn (otherwise than in the idiom 
described in §9 : 8 (iii) above) can be replaced by I.S~:

§9 : 10 . Arabic has no form corresponding structurally to English 
'nobody', 'nothing', 'no (noun), (apart from the structure described in 
§9: 5), and sentences containing expressions of this nature are normally 
represented by the structure 'not ... any .. .':

~ ~"Y 'a nullity', Quite com;on: however, is the i~se;tion of"i between 
the preposition hi and its noun, in the sense 'without': ~.!.l:. ~ 'without

§9 : 15· The verbal abstrnct 'i;.i:s. 'absence, non-existence' may be 
annexed to another verbal abstrnct with the function of negativing it:

10 
INTENSIFIED ADJECTIVES AND 
SIMILAR WORD PATTERNS 
§ ro: I. A word pattern ~, 
is often used as an adjective having an 
intensified sense 'particularly/ specially so-and-so': parallel to the simple 
adjective t;r 'speedy' there is t;.J 'particularly speedy'; parallel to 
~ 
there is ~f 
'specially big'. Like other adjectives, these are 
capable of functioning as nouns [§, : 21]. Except as described below 
[§IO : 8), this pattern has no differentiation between masculine and 
feminine, or between singular and plural. 
§TO: 2. When the sentence contains an entity-term used as a standard 
of comparison cxpressed by the use of the preposition r:r: (which in this 
case is equivalent to 'in relation to'), the intensified adjective must be 
rendered in English by the 'more, , .' or '-er' form: \..i,A :r fi.'l ,-;-,l:S"" 
'a bigger book than this'; G '..i.r. .j.rl r 'he is more acquainted with 
this than we are'. This may also be the case in contexts where a standard 
of comparison is clearly implied even if not overtly stated, 
§ ro: 3. When an intensified word-pattern of this kind functions as a 
noun annexed to an entity-term describing a category within which the 
noun alluded to by the intensified pattern is included, then the intensified 
word pattern must be rendered by 'mOSt, , .' or '-est' forms in English. 
Two possible structures occur in this case, the first being that in which 
the category term is a defined plural: ~ pi 1.lA 'this is the biggest of 
his books'; '..i.r. l:.i.r1 y. 'he is the best acquainted of us with this'. 
§ ro: 4. An alternative to this structure is one in which the category 
term is expressed by an undefined singular: LAl!':i ~ 
~l 
'the 
most difficult pro~lem which we have encountered~ rW1 J ..!.I.\,o J..il 
'the noblest king in the world'. 
§ ro: 5. When an intensified word pattern is annexed to a defined 
singular, it signifies 'the" ,-est part of'. Hence, whereas 0..u.l J.oi.--oi 
77 

I NTENS IFI ED ADJ ECTIVE S 
[§IO: 3] and ~...v Ji...-i [§IO : 4] both imply 'the lowest town (among a 
group of other towns]" the sense of ~...u. \ Ji...-i is 'the lowest part of the 
town'. 
§IO : 6. The category term can also be represented by a clause 
beginning with ,;. or Lo [§4 : 6]: ~b Lo y .i 'the most beautiful thing 
I have seen', ~b ,;. jl:l 'the handsomest person I have seen'. Such 
expressions can then be further particularized by the addition of an 
explicit category noun in the defined plural introduced by the preposition 
0-:: ~lJ. 1 if ~b Lo jl:l 'the most beautiful Sight I have seen'; 
e\.!J.\ if ~b ,;. J':i 'the handsomest shaikh I have seen'. These 
latter structures are consequently congruous in sense with ~ 
J;:I 
..:..,~ , nd ..:..,~ &- J';1. 
§IO: 7. When there is no standard of comparison expressed or 
implied, and no category term expressed or implied, the intensified 
adjective form must be rendered by 'very .. .' or by the simple unqualified 
adjective in English: r)ll ~I 'the very learned shaikh'j .;J...,.a11 
~)l 1 'the Grand Vizier'; ~ ~)l 1 ~)I 'the really important subject'. 
This is the case with certain adjectival notions which are expressed in 
- ., 
Arabic only by the intensified form, such as L 
J I 'middle', 
§IO: 8. T raditional, and to a large extent modern, prose usage 
requires that the intensified adjective fonn should only exhibit differentia-
tion between masculine and feminine, singular and plural, when it has 
imlfthe article. If this is not the case, then only the context will reveal 
whether its implications are masculine or feminine, singular or plural: 
c....rt:.l\ ( }"""t I'"" 'they are the most generous of men'; ~b ~...v jl:i u" 
'it is the most beautiful city I have seen'; .. LiJI jl:i .. 'Y~ 'these are the 
most beautiful of women'. When it has the article, it is differentiated 
according to the follOwing patterns: 
Singular 
Plural 
Masculine 
J,J)'1 
J:'\i~1 
Feminine 
though there are a few such adjectives which have a masculine plural of a

aircraft', and conversely <.S ~J 
<.S.r:-' 
IJ ~ 'great and small states'. 
§IO: 10. A noun which qualifies [§I : 19] an intensified adjective has 
the undefined fonn, thus contrasting with the structure involving a simple 
adjective. Further, the adjective is in this case not formally annexed to the 
noun, from which it follows that the noun need not immediately follow 
the adjective. In fact, there is a fairly strong tendency to place the quali-
fying noun in this structure right at the end of the sentence. The simple 
adjective structure if WI o-ir. ~;oll L:"!t .r 'he is widely acquainted 
with these problems' contrasts with ~ 
......... ifLlI Il.lr, G t:'Jl .r 'he 
is more widely acquainted than us with these problems'. En~lish idiom 
will often require sentences of this nature to be recast: if l:.1 ~ I 0 \S"

~I 'we seek the good', but are often incorporated into the same 
Structures as intensified adjective forms: thus, r!ll~ if e

a better thing than that'; t"'''r 'the worst of them'. 
§IO: 1:1. J~i 'first' and ~T 'last' are also intensified adjectives 
(though slightly irregular in pattern) and occur in the annexion structures 
described §§IO : 3, 4: .JJ 6- r i J j l'the first thing which he attempted';

CIRCUMSTANCE CLAUSES 
§II : I. A 'circumstance' clause has the primary function of describing 
a situation which is represented as simply an attendant circumstance to the 
main statement; and it may have one of three possible structures: (i) it 
may begin immediately with an imperfect verb, or (ii) it may begin with 
• .[:;'j followed by a perfect verb, or (if negative) with • ~J and an 
imperfect verb, or (iii) it may begin with J plus a thematic structure. 
§ II : 2. A circumstance clause of type (i) may either describe a situa-
tion existing simultaneously with that of the main statement, or an inten-
tion present at that time: o~ J I-;"'l:~11 ~ 
i:..r> 'he went out carrying 
~ 
. 
) 
. 
the book in his hand'; .;l;>-)l~ ~\ ~ 
01..r JI ~~ 'he went to 
Amman with the intention of informing the king of the news'. In type 
(ii) the situation is anterior in time to the main statement, and in type (iii) 
contemporaneous with it: 1-;"')-\ ~~ .uJ el.(,ll o~ ~ 
~ 
'these 
events occurred when the war had ceased'; ~li I-;"')-~ t:I;Jl o~ 0.r.-
'these events occurred while the war was going on'. 
§rt : 3. The purely temporal implications of a circumstance clause 
may, however, have added to them a logical significance which may be 
either causal (,inasmuch as') or antithetical (,although'). It is therefore 
important to recognize such a clause, and to appreciate that J is not in 
these cases a connective [§5: 2] and should not be translated 'and'. 
Clauses of types (ii) and (iii) can often be recognized by the fact that the 
presence of J.j or the thematic structure interrupts a sequence of sen-
tences beginning wim a narrative perfect verb: ~t~;; .uJ .r.,j)1 ~~ l

was at that time absent from the coulltry, and all opposition ceased'. 
g, 

., 
C I RCUMSTANCE CLAUSES 
§I I : 4. The formal criterion distinguishing a circumstance clause of 
eype (i) from a qualifying clause is that the laner can only be introduced 
without the functional which marks it as such when the qualified noun is 
undefined [§4: 1,31; whereas the entity-term whose situation is described 
by a circumstance clause is regularly defined. 
§I I : 5. A circumstance c1aus~ beginning with .J will sometimes be 
found treated functionally as a theme phrase introduced by Cot [§6 : 3 
(iii)]: ;>T J"i J ~ 
-0f + 
1..i.A if l;S.) ..I.t.J c.t 'inasmuch as 
we have now finished wit~ this, we must consider another matter'. 
§! I : 6. An idiom which deserves some remark is the use of a circum-
stance clause beginning with.J after a phrase which has nOt gOt the formal 
structure of a sentence, but may be felt [Q be equivalent in sense to one, 
Instead of the structure, of a fonnal sentence with circumstance clause 
attached, U~- ~-Il I.lr. -(:,-; Y-J;L ~ 
~some time has passed 
while we have been concerning ourselves with this project', one may 
encounter u.r11 I.lr. (r Y-J ;L ) £ 
'for some time past we have 
been concerning ourselves with this project',

CONDITIONAL SENTENCES AND 
SIMILAR STRUCTURES 
§ 12 : I, Conditional sentences have a characteristic structure in that 
a perfect verb at the beginning of either of the two component clauses 
changes its normal implications to those of an imperfect, and will there-
fore have to be rendered by an English present in the conditioning clause, 
and by a present or future in the conditioned one, unless the context is 
such that an imperfect would, without the presence of a conditioning 
clause, have referred to past time [§3 : 19 (ii)]. T he principal functionals 
which mark a conditioning clause are· 01 and 1;1 'if';

'if you ask him, he will reply' 
'if we think about this, we see the

On the other hand, if rhe COntext is such that rJJ~ would, uncon-
ditioned, have implied 'he used to consult them', this will generate the 
conditional structure r JJ\..!. J U-I ~:::; I 1; \ 'if the situation de-
manded, he used to consult them', In the conditioning clause, the only 
alternative to the verbal sentence-structure is a rather rare one in thematic 
sentence structure with -01 followed by a pronoun theme: ~)l.; f ' 01 
'if you ask him', In the conditioned clause, however, any other type of 
sentence structure can and frequently does occur, provided that it is 
marked as a conditioned one by having .j placed before it:

CONDITIONAL SENTENCES

perfect [§9 : 4J. this form in a conditional sentence undergoes the same 
shift in meaning as the affirmative perfect: ~-4 r ~

not write, he will not ·go'. 
§n : 4. 1'>1 with the conditional structure can also have the sense of 
'when' (referring to the future) or 'whenever'; ~l!' I!..l>..r.>-' ~~\

obvious' 
'whatever he says, I will not 
believe him' 
'whatever the case may be' 
'whenever we attempt this, we find 
it useless'. 
It should however be observed that some of these functionals, e.g. ,:;. 
and I)S'"", normally use the characteristic conditional structure only when 
the clause they introduce precedes the complementary clause; whereas if 
they come after the main clause, the perfect verb should be taken as 
alluding to past time: l.k JIJ if J.l..:.i r'I have never believed anyone

§12 : 7. Hypothetical sentences also consist of two clauses, but present 
the conditioning proposition as a mere supposition, or a remOte possi. 
bility, or as definitely invalid. These imply no time indication at all, and 
will have to be rendered in English in one of two ways only determinable 
by the context (examples below). The conditioning clause is introduced

distinctively conditional use of the perfect, but any part of it which comes 
after the anti-conditioning clause is normally introduced by ...). In the 
case of }) the main statement does have the hYPQ[hetical main statement

TERMINAL VARIATIO NS IN NOUNS AND 
ADJECTIVES 
§IJ: I. Most nouns and adjectives, and all imperfect verbs, have a set 
of terminal variations, the choice between which is dictated by the 
function of rhe word in relation to the fest of the sentence. All these 
phenomena are together grouped uncler the name of ,-:,,~l To a large 
extent, these phenomena are manifested only in short vowels at the end 
afthe word, and to that extent are not apparent in unvowe11ed script, and 
hence can (and indeed must) be disregarded for the purpose of simply 
reading and comprehending Arabic as normally written. At rhe same 
time, there are cases where these phenomena do manifest themselves in 
the ordinarily written shape of the word, and it is therefore necessary to 
g ive an account both of the functional situations which govern the choice 
of ,-:-,lrl, and of the variations in word pattern which they entail. 
§13 : 2. There are three varieties of '"':"'lrl applicable to nouns and 
adjectives, and three applicable to imperfects. 2~ is the name given to 
the short vowel termination -u which occurs in nouns, adjectives and 
imperfects, and also to other phenomena which occur in some words in 
functional situations which would in others require the short vowel-u. 
~ 
is the name given to the shott vowel termination -a in some words, 
and functionally parallel phenomena of another kind in others, and this 
likewise occurs in nouns, adjectives and imperfects. ~ 
or ~ 
is the 
name given to the short vowel termination -i, characteristic only of nouns 
and adjectives, and to other functionally parallel phenomena. 
Also included under the heading of ,-:-,!rl is a terminal -n added after 
the variable vowel in certain circumstances [§I3: II]. 
§13: 3· Besides the broken plural patterns of nouns (and some 
adjectives, § I : 25), there is a plural pattern in which a masculine termina-
tion is added to the basic pattern of [he singular, the latter remaining 
unchanged; [his termination is also susceptible of '"':"'!rl variation, being 
-una for the ~.) and -ina for the ~ 
and ~. There is a parallel 
88 
TERMINAL VARIA T IONS IN NOUNS 
feminine termination which is -atu(n) for the ~ 
and -ati(n) for ~ 
and ~, which replaces the -aCt) termination of the singular if this is 
present, although a plural of this kind is in some cases found with words 
of which the singular does not have it, such as <..:-'~! 'election', ...:..~~1 
'elections'. And whereas this masculine plural termination always (with 
- , -
one or twO anomalous exceptions such as 0.."...:...-., ~ 
'years') alludes 
-
--
to male persons, the feminine one is applicable to persons and things. 
§r3: 4. The principal classes of word in which this type of plural 
occurs 3re derived adjectival patterns ending in -&::r [§r : 20] and partici-
pial patterns [§§8 : 7, II]. Thus, for 'Egyptian' one bas 
fern. pluto 
masc. plur. 
fern. sing. 
masc. sing. 
e:, c,-",,", 1 - , 
, .:, -"""' 1 :"~ I

do 
:" c,-",,", 1 - - -",,",I [':'-",,",1 
~-",,",I 
~ 
'-""' 
.:, -"""' 1 
;"-",,",1 
? 
In addition, a few of the intensified adjective patterns use a masculine 
, 
), . , 
plural of this kind [§ IO: 8J, such as 0)?':1\ 'most people'. 
§r3: 5· T he choice of ,-:-,Ir! for a qualifying adjective is dictated by 
the functional position (and hence the ~ ~1) of the noun it qualifies; 
and the explanatory noun of a demonstrative [§2 : I J has the <..:-'!rl which 
is appropriate to the function of the demonstrative in the sentence. 
§13 : 6. The functional situations requiring ~ of a noun or adjective 
are when it is 
(a) the theme of a thematic sentence structure, except as mentioned 
below [§13 : 8 (a)]; or 
(b) the agent of a verb of specific application, or surrogate agent of 
a verb of vague application [§8 : 3]; or 
(c) the predicate in a thematic sentence structure, unless the latter is 
modified as mentioned below [§13: 8 (c, .I)]; or 
(.I) the agent of the verbal concept expressed by a participle or 
adjective used in the structure described in §§8 : 15. 16.

§IJ: 7· TIle functional siruations requiring /.- are

(6) rhe function of qualifier to an annexed noun or adjective 
[§I : 12, 19]. 
Thus, ~;j)..lJ! J 'in the slate', ~;j)..lJ1 f., j ) 'the minister of state', ~~1 t?ti 
'devoid of understanding'. 
§I J : 8. The scope of the use of the ~ 
is a good deal wider and 
more complex; besides situations to be described later, it occurs in 
(a) a theme preceded by one of the functionals which impart object 
status to the theme (§§6: J, 4, .,]: ...:..;l,...li ~~P.'"')!! '\)1 'the princess has

,4- \;'1\ 'they were outside the organization'. It is ro be remarked 
that when a defined predicate is marked as such by the insertion of a 
pronoun [§z : 71 after one of these modifying verbs, the resulting srruc-
ture is treated in one of twO alternative ways: the pronoun with the 
predicate may be treated as a clause form in which the predicate is as 
normal in the & form, as in 0.r.1\;Jl r' ,-:"..rJ1 015", or the pronoun may 
be treated as a pure functional not affecting the structure of modifying 
verb plus predicate, as in ~\;Jl r' ,-:"..rJ1 01,) 'the Arabs were the 
victors'. 
(J) either theme or predicate of a proposition which is an objcct of

terminal vowel variation: hence, ~ J.;l! ~

preceding paragraph, when they are neither made defined by the addition 
of the article 00' in annexed position, are divisible into twO classes 
exhibiting different types of ,-:,,'rl. One class, in these circumstances, 
has only two potentialities of ,-:,,~1 variation, namely -u for the & and 
-a for both ~ 
and /.-. This class is signalized in Wehr by a 2. The 
principal types of noun and adjective belonging to this class are: 
(a) those having the pattern J..=;f or .. ~. 
(6) broken plurals of certain patterns, including among others 
those with the vocalic pattern a - a -i or a - a - t or a - a - i-aCe); 
(c) nouns of single application which are of non-Arabic origin; 
(tI) nouns of single application ending in 0, or referring to female 
persons even when not SO ending.

§IJ : II. All other nouns and adjectives (including a number of 
names of males, which are defined in themselves [§I : 71 and are not made 
defined by the article) belong to the other class. These are characterized 
by the fact that, when neither defined by the article nor in annexed 
position, they have the full range of three terminal variations and auto-
matically assume an - 11 after a variable short ,-:,,~1 vowel; but this 11 is 
not reflected in the consonantal shape of the word (§S : z6], except in the 
case of the ~ 
termination -a-n which is marked by an added a/if; 
nevertheless, this added alif is not used if the word ends in ~ or in a

§IJ: 16. After)l used in the sense of 'there is no .. .' {§9: 5], the noun 
has the termination -a but without any additional on; and since the 
conventional spelling with alif[§IJ : II] explicitly represents rhe termina-
, , 
tion -a-n, this alifis not present in these cases, hence the spellings ~ )I 
etc. 
§IJ : 17· T he use of the ~ 
also indicates an internal object. This is 
in principle the verbal abstract of the verb to which it serves as object, 
and it may either stand alone or be qualified in any way appropriate to a 
noun; it can however be replaced by a different verbal abstract, or (if 
qualified by an adjective) omitted altogether. The struCtures involving 
the use of an internal object often require considerable recasting in order 
to achieve an idiomatic English rendering. The following are some 
characteristic examples. 
'he was overjoyed' 
'the dog barked loudly' 
'he ran swiftly' 
'he laughed like any madman' 
'he made progress in a manner 
astonishing to us' 
'he has not striven as much as we

TE RMINAL VARIATION S I N TH E I lUP E RF EC T 
§14 : I. T he terminal variations of the imperfeet verb can be divided 
into those affecting the forms where the agent pronoun is indicated by 
variations at the beginning of the word only, and those affecting the 
forms where the end of the word also reflects the agent pronoun. In the 
former set, the terminal variations are -u and -a, named respectively & 
and ~ 
(as are the same vowels when used in noun and adjeetive 
terminations), and absence of vowel, named i~ ' In those forms of the 
imperfect in which the end of the word reflects the agent pronoun, the 
forms terminating in -una and -ina represent the cl;, while the ~ 
and i :r:- are alike characterized by omission of the syllable -na (and 
consequential adding of an alif after -u, see §3 : 15); in those forms in 
which the termination is simply -na no terminal variation occurs at all. 
The & form of an imperfect occurs in all situations where there is no 
specific factor demanding ~ 
or i ;r:-, as described below. 
§14 : 2. Situations requiring ~ 
of the imperfect are 
(i) when it is preceded by ·0i: ~ W\ if ~j: 0i t"J"i 'he 
commanded them to go away from the capital'. 
(ii) when it is preceded by ~ 
I~ 
'in order to', or by li- when 
used in that sense: !,t ~ 
I\} A s:J ~ 
i; 'they made preparations 
in order to depart'. 
(iii) when it follows a negative proposition, or a query or a com-
mand or prohibition, and is introduced by ~ having the sense of 'so as 
to'; this structure contrasts with the use of ~ with a cl; which is a fresh 
factual statement, while the use of the ~

PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES 
§IS : I. The importance.of a prepositional phrase as indirect object of 
a verb, in defining the sense of the verb itself, has already been mentioned 
[§J : 24J. One usage of general application deserves notice, connected 
with the proposition ,;s. When this is used after a verb which has a sense 
equivalent to an adjectival predicate [§3 : 4), the adjective must in English 
- ,-
be modjfied by the addition of 'too'; ~J6! .:r ~ 
'he was toO weak 
to fight them'. 
§I S : 2. Prepositional phrases have also an important function as 
replacements for an annexion structure, particularly when the latter is 
(owing to its peculiar features described in §§r : n, 13) unsuitable. In 
principle, a verbal abstract or any other noun embodying a verbal 
concept can be annexed to an entity-tenn which represents either the 
theme pronoun of the verb or its direct object: beside the verbal sentence 
,- . 
"-!k:-I 'he answered him', the verbal abstract annexed to the pronoun 
~6:-1 may mean either 'the answer he gave' (with pronoun corresponding 
to the theme pronoun of the verb) or 'the answer given to him' (with 
pronoun corresponding to the direct object pronoun). But if it is desired 
to use the verbal abstract in e.g. the way described in §IJ: 7 (i), which 
demands that it should be undefined, this structure is impossible, since 
annexion to the pronoun, which is a defined entity-term, makes the 
annexed word also defined [§I : 13], and a prepositional phrase must be 
used in lieu. Similarly when it is desired to qualify a noun of any kind 
which requires to be undefined in sense, by a defined entity-teno, the 
prepositional phrase replacement must be used instead of the annexion 
structure. Nor can a noun be annexed to two qualifying entity-tenos if the 
nature of the qualification of each one is different: it is possible to write 
. , 
~oU;-~ ,JUI ~ 
'the love of money and of rank', but in 'John's love 
of money', where the qualifier 'john's' corresponds to the theme of the 
verb in ' JUI ~ 
...d.: 'John loves money' but the qualifier 'of 
money' corresponds to the direct object, then 'love' cannot be annexed to 
both. 
P RE P OSI TI ONAL PHRASES 
99 
§15: J. In all such situations, the annexion structure can be replaced 
by a prepositional phrase with _ J or .,,:;-:. _ J is used when the qualifying 
term represents either the direct object of the verbal idea, or a 'possessor' 
of the qualified noun (i.e. an entity which can be said to 'have' it in the 
widest range of senses); ,,:;-: is used when the qualifying term represents 
either the theme pronoun of a verbal idea, or an entity of which the 
qualified noun is a part. Hence, 
(i) substitution for the direct object: 
'my love of her' 
'a solution of these difficulties' 
'he smiled by way of answering 
m,' [§'J' '9(0)] 
(ii) substitution for the 'possessor': 
" 
-",:>\I t l 
'a brother of the prince' 
.... I U~-
t_ 
~ JI-"J ..\...ou J...>. 
'a remote limit of the country' 
(iii) substitution for the theme pronoun: 
~ 
~~ \ 
'a belief held by me' 
_~ 
-
.~oJ 
_ ~ 
if .r- ,I.,;" I.u. .:..Jj 
'I said this out of satisfaction on my

(iv) part-whole relationship between the terms: 
o 
.. 
• 
J 
_.!.Ill 1 ,\i :,..,1 if l.l.:.". 
'one group of the king's friends' 
§15 : 4· In addition to the expedient described under §I5: J (iv) for 
handling expressions of the type 'an X of the Y', a common idiomatic 
structure is 'an X of (if) the Xs of Y', e.g.: 
-
oj 
_ 
_0_. 
01::.,J _ L J 'r- if : " J:r cl 
'in a Country district of the 
Lebanon' 
§I5: 5. Where a structure consisting of annexed noun plus qualifying 
noun is followed by a qualifying adjective, it may not always be clear 
which of the two nouns the adjective is intended to qualify. This ambi-
guity can be resolved by replacing the annexion structure by a preposi-
tional phrase with J. The same is done in cases where the writer feels 
that the adjective belongs more closely with the noun it qualifies than 

.00 
PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES 
does the noun qualifier (whereas the rules of annexion demand that the 
noun qualifier to an annexed noun must precede the adjective 
qualifier [§J; 12.]). Thus, ,~~ J}/' ~~\ means explicitly 
'the first stage of the conflict', whereas JJ)I\ ~~..".J.! .iJ>...,.. is ambiguous 
and could mean either that or 'the stage afme first conflict'. And although 
there is no formal ambiguity, one may well find, e.g . .,.u, ~lS"'L..:y , u-"jJI 
.t...l:-\' 'the basic object of this policy' if the writer feels that 'basic 
object' is a more closely hound phrase than 'object of this policy'. 
§15 : 6. A prepositional phrase with v-: can also be used as a substirute 
for a simple undefined noun: !U\ if ~..; 'we drank some water', 
~y-P if ~~ J r.;") ':1 'I do not see"any difficulty in that', The 
• 
undefined predicate adjective can be replaced by 0:: with the defined 
adjective (the preposition then giving it an undefined sense), and this is 
specially common when, for structural reasons, such as length or com-
plexity of the theme phrase, the predicate adjective precedes its logical 
theme: ~b ' J..,Al\ \..l.A> 'this statement is false', but -Jy4i -0i ~\)\ if 
1..lA 'it is false for us to say this' (logically equivalent [0 'that we should 
say this, is a falSity'). And a very characteristic idiom is the use of rJ: to 
give an explicitly undefined sense to r:;. or 1.., which may in themselves 
connote either a defined or an undefined entity [§4: 7]: Of ~" Y' 
-
' .. , 
IS ~ 
..L;... 'he is a person whom I have known since my youth'; 
:;:~,-
, . 
. . 0\ .b~ L........ 'a thing which should be noticed is that •. .'. 
§I S : 7· When the direct object of a verb is a pronoun, one may 
occasionally find, in lieu of prepositional substitution after the verbal 
abstract or participle, qualifying pronoun forms [§2.: 16] attached to 
C"l: u.~l ~ 
'my love of her', ~~l ~ 
'her love of me'. 
§15 : 8. Participle forms can be annexed to the direct object term, or if 
requisite the latter can be replaced by the prepositional substitution with 
J; these Stnlcrures are normal when the participle is used as a noun. But 
PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES 
if it has the sense of an adjective, the direct object rerm can retain the 
~

§rs: 9. The ~ 
for the direct object can also be retained after a 
verbal abstract: -~~I ~l 
J~l 'the Muslims' embracing of 
Christianity'.

QUERIES , COMMANDS AND EXCLAMATIONS 
§I6: I. When a proposition is queried instead of stated, l or 0JA is 
placed in front of the normal statement structure: p ':Jl ~~ JA 'is the 
prince going?'; ~Y'"'" 1.k Ji 'is there any difficulty in this?', It is a 
special peculiarity of i that it is placed in front of the basic connectives: 
1.k 0J...\.4;;,.cii 'do you then believe this?', 
, . 
§16: 2. If the query is posed in the form of two alternatives, i' is 
placed in front of the second alternative: J!)J1 \"i ~':J\ ~~i 'is it 
the prince or the minister who is going?'; ':J if 1.k ~i 
'did you know 
this or not?' [§9: 13]. 
§I6: 3.°;" 'who?' and L.. or 1~L. 'what?' can either be treated as 
themes having a subsequent pronoun referring back to them, Or as 
sentence elements displaced from their normal position to the beginning 
of the sentence. In this displacement they are accompanied by any 
preposition belonging to them: 
.:.."II J J". if} 
.:.."II J if 
'who is in the houser 
11> . .1 J ....... if} 
1-,,> Jy; .) 
'to whom do you say this?' 
The L.. which asks a question, when it is preceded by a preposition, is 
shortened to -i and often written as one word with the preposition: 
~ 
-i":k- 'on what does he rely?', 1..lJe. &- ; r:- 'from what does this 
resultr [§4: 10]. Observe that -r: 'for what?j why?' will have to be 
distinguished from the negative· i1 [§9 : 4}·

tures referred to above: 
-.,; ~; -,£I. ,I ;st.} 
'which of the books do you desire?' 
~; -,£II ,",I cl 
§16: 5. Queries in any of the above structures can function as entity-
terms serving as object of a verb: ~~ if ot.:.lt... 'we asked him who 
would go', \~ jAb:- ~i J -.!,l.!.i 'we are doubtful about which of 
them is ignorant of this'. In this type of structure, i and jA must be 
rendered by 'whether': 0Jo:A~ jA ot.:.lt......li 'we have asked him whether 
they will go'. But in modem style, it is common in this structure to 
replace i or jA by 1~1 or Gi l,. J with the following clause in the Struc-
ture of a conditioning one [§n: I] (an idiom comparable with English 
use of 'if' in such cases): ~ .JA-P \..lJe, J G.ilS' \~1 L.. J -.!,l.!.i 'we are 
doubtful whether there is any difficulty in this'; ~ J 0lS' '~1 ~,q " t~ 
!,.,..,JII.1 0i 'we will enquire if it is in his mind to go'. 
§I6 : 6. Commands are expressed by verb forms evolved by removing 
the first syllable from the if;- of the imperfect; if this process results in a 
word pattern with initial unvowelled consonant, it will be necessary to 
prefix alif[§S: :1:1]: llA J ~ ;S:j 'think about this!'; ~)1 'leave it 
alone!' (both addressed to seve;al persons); -~l 'stay!'; -Jt..:i (Type VI 
from.J .J . tJ 'come on!' (addressed to one man). Command forms of 
Type IV verbs, however, always begin with' a-, whether or not the first 
consonant of the root is vowelled: ~t 
'answer!'. Commands expressed 
in this way are always positive, since the negative command, or prohibi-
tion, is expressed by the structure described in §I4 : 3 (ii). 
§I6: 7. There are one or twO irregular command forms. e.g .• ~ 
.. 
. ., 
I 
'ask!' (root J .1 . ...,..), and ..L,:o.:. 'take!' (root ~ .t. ). 
§I6: 8. When a command is followed immediately (with no connec-
tive) by a i:r:- imperfect, the latter expresses the anticipated result of

obedience to the command: ~

previously been described in §IO: 13. The ~

terribly alarmed at this reque:t!' [§ 13: 17]. 
§I6: 10. When a person is addressed by name, ~ is ordinarily 
placed before the name; when the address is by a description the 
descriptive noun has the article and is preceded by ~f (~) : 
4...1tt ~ 'Fatimah!', {..Js::n .. ($).411 ~i 'gentle reader!'.

SOME MISC E LLANEOU S FUNCTIONALS 
§I7: I. t... is perhaps the most difficult word in Arabic for the beginner 
to deal with, because of its enormous variety of functions. In addition 
to those already mentioned [§§4 : 6, 9: I, 12: 6, J6: 3], it may be used 
(i) as a substitute for '\)1, or for· 0f plus perfect verb, introducing 
a noun clause [§6 : 5], as in ~~ t... ~ 
= 
'-:-"'~ 0i ~ 
'after he went'; 
(ii) after an undefined noun, reinforcing the sense of indefiniteness: 
• 
t... ~J 'some man or other'. 
§17 : 2. ;;:.- is used 
(i) before a ~ 
imperfect, to denote either (a) purpose, and thus 
congruous in sense with S [§I4: 2 (ii)], as in llA !f:i; ~ 
~t... 'they 
questioned him in order to ascertain this', or (h) that the following clause 
describes a terminus ad quem which was not necessarily realized in fact, 
as in!;~ ~ 
)2.:;1 'he waited for them to depart'; 
(ii) before a perfect, or a & imperfect, or :: 0f with a thematic 
sentence structure, to denote a factual consequence or an objective which 
was in fact realized, as in ~; ~ 
~)Z:; I 'they waited until he did 
depart'; ~ 
0j~ (r"1J) J;>- llA ~ 
J.j 'they have investigated 
this, so that they know the truth of it'. This usage of ~, when it 
follows a negative, requires idiomatic recasting in English, as exemplified 
in: ~~ ~.r. i~ r..S> J~I if ~~~-".-; r 'before we had finished 
speaking, he began on a new topiC'; i~ J;>- J~l if ~ 
"ill r 
~~ ~..r. 'scarcely had we finished speaking when he began on a 
new topic'; 
(iii) before an entity-term (the '-7'~1 of which is unaffected), with 
the sense of 'even', as I~ 0j.l"! Jt.a.)l1 r..S> 'even children know this'; 

w6 
MI SCELLANEOUS FVNCTIONALS 
(iv) as a preposition meaning 'as far as', thus ~~, ~ 
~ 
J.i 
'they have investigated it to the very bottom'. 
§ I7: 3. W
and ·;1 (or "0f '>1 followed by thematic sentence struc-
ture) are both used in two ways, either as a purely temporal 'when' or 
in the causal sense of 'because' (as with English 'since' used both tem-
porally and causally). The differentiation between them is that the clause 
following CJ depicts a situation anterior in time to that of the main 
statement, while the clause following '>1 depicts one contemporaneous 
with the main statement*: ~.> 14-: r-.r.>-i CJ 'when he had told 
them this, he went'; ~ 
"0f J.-c.. ~ 
~Jf 1..i.A \.i~J U. 'since 
we have found this to be untrue, we ~n disregard it', J;"-'I '>10lS'" 
OJ JI o,:.:,::.JI J ~ 
'he was, when he resigned, thinking of 
returning to his homeland'; ~,!I~ L~ ulJ-. .i.lU-I ul$'" ; \ 'since the 
situation was thus, they returned'. 
After a clause which is introduced by ~ 
or ' .~. -:: 'while', the 
beginning of the principal statement is normally signalized by ;1 : 
JYJ ~J ;11.!.11; J:.i ~ 'while we were engaged on that, a messenger 
arrived'. 
§17 : 4· The use of 1;1 to introduce a conditioning clause [§rz : 4] or 
a query clause [§16 : 5] has already been mentioned. It can, however, also 
begin a complete sentence in thematic structure; the theme being marked 
either by ~J or by the preposition bi. The function of this structure is to 
add an effect of special vividness or picturesqueness to the statement: 
'-:"'l:ll ulJ-. 0..,.l!..11 1;1.1 ~I if ~ 
'I walked out of the house, and 
there were the actors at the door!'; ':"L.. ..u J::'" ~~ \;1.1 4i~ 1 l:.,6:..) 'we 
entered the room, and there was the prince lying dead!'. 
§17: 5· 1;1 is occasionally used synonymously with W, as: 4
1 1;1 
'-:"'J.l7 JL.. ':/1 .:....6:.1 ,-:",)-1 'when the war had ended, hopes began

"'7 
fading'; an ambiguity is thereby created, since this structure could 
formally (and in a suitable context) be interpreted as 'when the war ends, 
hopes will begin fading'. T his usage of 1;1 is, however, regular in the 
combination \;1 ~: .r.>-i ~ ~iJ ~ 
1;1 ~ 
~l;-II oh J ;s.; 
lr. J::'" '11 'he thought about this policy until, when he had formed his 
opinion on it, he communicated it to the prince'. 
§ I7 : 6. The combination of the preposition ~!l with :;;0f (or -0i plus 
perfect verbal sentence structure) has special idiomatic senses; contrary 
to the usual principles [§6: 5 (i, ii)], the foHowing proposition is not 
necessarily factual. The combination is commonly used to introduce a 
clause containing a simile: 0~ .Lits ;:';jJI if ~ 
'he ran out of the 
room as ifhe were mad'. 
§ I7 : 7· :;;Js can also be placed in front of a comple£e sentence in 
thematic structure, and then has the effect of toning down the statement 
if it is felt to be toO bald and categorical in its unmodified form; English 
has various means of doing this, a cOf!lmon one being the insertion of 
'seem' into the statement: I.lr. J+4 ~ts 'you seem to be ignorant of 
this'; .i.lWI olr. !.r~~·ij ~ ~~P l :;;0tS- 'the government seems to 
pay no attention to this problem'. 
§17 : 8. 1..51 placed in front of a sentence (the structure of which it 
does not modify) has the effect of putting a special emphasis on the last 
member (clause, phrase or word) of the sentence: 1lr: ~ ! til 'it was 
with this in particular that we concerned ourselves'; ~jJ !.lr. ~ ! til 
'it was for a particular reason that we concerned ourselves with this'. 
This emphasis is, however, often very much weakened, and may have 
little more than the force of English 'but', 'still', 'only': Ih 0~ J.i 
0lA...r. Jl (.b:; till ~ 
'this may well be [rue, but it needs proof'. 
, , 
§17: 9· '-:"' J annexed to an undefined singular noun corresponds to 
English 'many a .. .': !h J lA.l.::i~ ~."....." ,-:",.J 'we have encountered

DUAL NUMBER AND NUMERALS 
§18: I. In addition to word forms appropriate to the singular and to 
the plural, which in Arabic implies more than two entities, Arabic also 
uses a 'dual' when the reference is to two individual entities of a category. 
In nouns and adjectives, this is indicated by the termination 01 for the 
&. or _;: for ~ 
and /.-. added to the singular form. When the 
word is annexed, the final syllable of this termination is dropped. Hence, 
J.,:.-~ .;...,. J 0~!J.,J:-l 'the two answers are in one single sense'; 
~~ _~~1 J' (..\;,;,;",,;1 'the inference from the two answers is 
obvious; 1..i.A ~

Jordan are in mutual agreement over this'; 0~) 
':I~ ..ra-" ~P J 'in the

§r8 : 6. D ual demonstratives, unlike their singular and plural counter-

~!.JliJ\/~;"~ in, _I.Jl::II/_;.-·;"n. It should be noted that the choice of 
forms is dictated by the functional relationship between these forms and 
the main statement; the functional position of the pronoun, within the 
qualifying clause, which looks back to these words is irrelevant to the 
choice of forms: 
~fo\ ')1 .. UI !.J~j)\ J~\ 'the two ministers whom I con-
sulted have resigned' 
'i?' ~jJ\ J...r.j)l ..:.,.~ \ 
'I consulted the two ministers who

§I8 : 8. Because of the existence of the dual forms, the Arabic numeral 
• 
'two' is relatively rarely used. It has the form..:.Jl [§S : 23] plus the termi-
nations characteristic of the masculine and feminine dual of nouns: 
. ~.~ ... 
"WI J ~~ 
"j 'for twO of the women'. 
§18 : 9. Duality can be emphasized by the use of an annexed entity-
term meaning 'both of . , .'. When annexed to nouns. this has the 
invariable forms '"j.S (masculine) and ill (feminine): 0'fA l:.!SJ

0~h..ul ~~ if . JS" J 'in both these two states'. 
§18: 10. The numeral 'one' is also relatively rarely used, in view of the 
structures described §§I: 3. 1: 17. See also §I: 18 on the noun ..l>-i/ LS..l>-l, 
DUAL NUMBERS AN D NUMERALS 
... 
The form ..l>-~ , ;..l>-~ can be used as adjective or noun, either of persons 
or things. 
§18: II. ~ 
annexed to a dual pronoun signifies in modem usage 
'each other': ~ 
~k:- Jl U::- 'the two of them sat beside each 
other'. In traditional Arabic this is expressed by the structure ~ 
, 
.~ 
~k:- JI ~ 
('one of them sat beside one'), and this traditional 
structure will still be encountered in modem writing. 
§I8: 12. The numerals 3 to 10 are annexed to the noun numbered, 
which is plural. The numeral forms terminate in 0 when the entity 
numbered is masculine in the singular, bm without 0 when it is feminine 
in the singular: Jk:-J ~~f 'four men'; u":kl ~~f 'four actresses'. 
. 
. 
'-" 
§18 : 13. After numerals from II to 99 the noun numbered is in the 
~ 
of the singular; those from 100 upwards are annexed to the 
singular noun. 
§I8 : 14. In the numerals 13 to 19, the unit element behaves according 
to the principle stated in §18 : 13, bm the 'ten' in the reverse way. All the 
forms are devoid of ,,-:,,~l and are uniformly vocalized with terminal 
-a: ~.J ~ 
~~ 
'fifteen men'; ".ll!l-;2 ~ ~ 
'fifteen 
actresses'. 
§18 : 15. The numeral II is also devoid of ,,-:,,~1, its ten element 
behaving as with 13 to 19, the 'one' element agreeing in form with the 
noun: ~.J ~~.~f. ~~f 'eleven men', ";.\!.(~o.J··~F. lS-~l 'eleven 
actresses'. In the numeral 12, the 'two' element has the terminal variations 
of a duai [§I8 : I]: ~.J ~-. -'" tlt i6; 'twelve men came'; ~t : -)1 
~.J -;.~ '" 'I met twelve men'; .. ~ 
-o-;.::.s. :;-~. ·~1 ~b 'I saw twelve 
actresses'; "~ 
~;-;..::.s. 81 u,,6; 'twelve actresses came'. 
§I8: 16. The numerals 20, 30, etc., up to 90 have no differentiation 
between masculine and feminine, but have terminations resembling those 
of the masculine plural described in §13: 17: ~.J ~0J~ ~ 
'twenty 
men were present'; "~ ~ 
rIs- 'he spoke to fifty actresses', 

DU A L NU M BE R S AN D NUMER ALS 
§18: 17, .4S\... 'a hundred' [§S : 27 (i)] is devoid of differentiation 
between masculine and feminine, and retains the singular form when 
preceded by unit numerals, but has a dual and a plural in other circum~ 
stances: J:-)~) 'four hundred men' [§I3 : 8], J:-) 1;;St.. ~ 
'two 
• 
• 
hundred men were present'; J:-) ~ \... ~ 
'they kil!ed twO hundred 
men'; L.ll:1)r\ if ...::..~ 'hundreds of tons', UtJf 'a thousand' behaves 
in every way like a noun except in the form exhibited by the numbered 
entity: J>:-) 0"::1T ~ 
'seven thousand men', 
§18 ; 18. The annexion structure whereby 'one' in annexion is not 
made defined [§I : 7} is in contemporary Arabic sometimes extended to 
other numerals: r..S -;....~ \ 0)1 ..1.:;.\ 'thousands of prisoners were taken'. 
§18: 19· The word pattern J:t-l; is used to construct ordinal numerals 
from 2 to 10: .L.l1J [§13: 12.] 'second', e ~ 'fourth', etc.; although d_~L.. 
'sixth' is anomalous in relation to the numeral 'six'. For the larger 
numbers, there are no distinctive forms, and the basic numeral forms are 
employed also as ordinals: .4SUI ,-:-,L:l1 'the hundredth chapter'. 
APPENDIX 
Abbreviations are relatively tittle used in Arabic, but the reader may 
well encounter the foHowing: 
( I) (::II (occasionally ,,1) = _,,;-!-T Jl and stands for 'etc:. 
(2) The word ~ ';II is commonly employed for 'etc: in quotations 
from the Qur'an. 
(3) In dates, the Christian era is denoted by \' (= ~.)~), the 
Mu,lim '" by . (~ :s~ ) , ,(,J (~ >')\,ll J') 's.c:, 
(4) c:: = ~'volume', '-'" = ~ 
'p<lge',and V" = ~ 'l i ne'.
