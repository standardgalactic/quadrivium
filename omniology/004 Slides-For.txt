●
In Programming a for loop represents a possibility to execute repetitive tasks; 
●
An object is iterable if we can iterate over that object;
 
 
●
If we have a collection of items, iterating over the collection means a way to get items out 
of the collection one by one;
●
Strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries are iterable objects;
iterable_object = [1, 2, 5, 9]
for item in iterable_object:
print(item)
Exemple:
os = ['Windows', 'Linux', 'Mac', 'Android']
for item in os:
   print('The name of the item in the list is ' + item )
