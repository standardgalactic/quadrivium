Inclusive fitness
From Andy Gardner, Department 
of Zoology, University of Oxford
Evolutionary theorist William 
Hamilton showed that natural 
selection leads organisms to 
maximise their “inclusive 
fitness”, not their personal 
reproductive success. That is, they 
behave as if they value the lives of 
relatives, which may lead them to 
exhibit altruism towards kin.
No such principle exists for 
multilevel selection, as described 
by David Sloan Wilson (Instant 
Expert, 6 August). Except for 
those special cases in which 
within-group selection is 
eliminated, groups cannot be 
regarded as fitness-maximising 
“superorganisms”. This is why 
evolutionary biologists prefer to 
work with inclusive fitness rather 
than multilevel selection. Only 
the theory of inclusive fitness 
describes both the process and the 
purpose of Darwinian adaptation.

From Bryn Glover
D. S. Wilson offered a useful and 
timely gathering of the thoughts 
of biologists over the past few 
decades on whether altruism is a 
natural characteristic or an 
artificial replicator of human 
culture – what Richard Dawkins 
called a “meme” – imposed by the 
demands of civilisation, religion 
and overpopulation.
As humanity approaches what 
may be its ultimate crisis over 
climate, energy, food, land and 
resources, it is vital that our 
tactics should be based upon the 
best information, science and 
analysis. Those who advocate 
business as usual, allowing 
market forces to continue to 
govern outcomes, often quote a 
form of simplistic Darwinism 
based on the phrases “survival of 
the fittest” and “nature red in 
tooth and claw”.
But supporters of a cooperative 
approach are frequently caught 
out by biologists’ apparent 
support for the individualistic 
manifestation of human 
behaviour. I am heartened that 
my arguments are now supported 
by what Wilson refers to as “a  
new consensus”, and that the 
individualism advocated by 
former UK prime minister 
Margaret Thatcher was at best 
wrong-headed. Unless we can 
devise a philosophical socialist 
approach to the production  
and distribution of resources, 
acceptable on a willing, voluntary 
basis by the vast majority, then 
humanity is probably destined  
for a new exploitative tribalism.

Seriously memetic
From Daniel Dennett,  
Tufts University
Perhaps the playful tone and title 
of Jonnie Hughes’s book On the 
Origin of Tepees (6 August, p 48) 
lulled reviewer Jonathan Keats 
into underestimating the book’s 
ambitious and original discussion 
of memes.
Unlike the vast majority of 
recent writings about memes, this 
is a serious book that does “add  
to the theory” in spite of Keats’s 
denial. It belongs on the reading 
list of anybody who hopes to use 
Richard Dawkins’s insight into 
memes, offering a serious 
scientific account of cultural 
change and innovation. That it  
is entertaining is a bonus, not a 
substitute for substance.

Unnecessary zombie
From Tim Allman
Elizabeth Hatherell’s discussion of 
medication problems in children 
perpetuates a misconception 
about attention-deficit disorder: 
she writes that the drugs “numb 
all feelings” (16 July, p 28). In fact, 
people respond differently,  
and finding the right drug and 
dose with tolerable side effects 
takes time.
If a child is numbed or 
“zombied out” by medication, 
there is a problem with the drug 
selection and/or dose. This is a 
side effect which no one should 
have to endure, not a necessary 
condition of treatment.

Truth about trees
From Christopher Dean
In his letter (18 June, p 35) Philip 
Stewart provided excellent tips 
for climate change mitigation: 
reforestation of denuded areas, 
greater use of timber products, 
and their reuse and recycling.  
My calculations have brought me  
to the same conclusions.
However, great care must be 
taken not to confuse those ideas 
with similar-sounding ones from 
forestry industries regarding 
primary forests or secondary 
forests after one harvest cycle.  
The industry is confusing the 
public, in Australia at least, by 
cloaking its logging operations  
in public-relations talk of 
reforestation.
Removing wood from primary 
forests and replanting trees has a 
time-averaged net emission for 
several harvest cycles, whereas 
reforestation on long-cleared land 
has net sequestration of carbon 
for several cycles.
We need to differentiate, stop 
wasting public resources on 
mischievous PR, and work on 
getting it right.

Answer to 1655 Number spotting: prime 43651 and square 12544 
The winner  J. Bolton of Rugby, Warwickshire, UK
Bob Walker
Joe drew a 5 by 5 grid and numbered 
the squares from 1 to 25 as 
indicated. He asked Penny to colour 
the 25 squares using the minimum 
number of colours, ensuring that for 
each square and the two, three or 
four squares next to it no two 
colours in that set were the same. 
Penny painted squares 1 and 23 red.
What other numbered squares did 
Penny paint red?
