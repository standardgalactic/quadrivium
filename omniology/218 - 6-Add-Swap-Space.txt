Use a File for Additional Swap Space: 
 
What is swap? – CentOS.org 
 
Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the 
system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are 
moved to the swap space. While swap space can help machines with a small amount of 
RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM. Swap space is located on 
hard drives, which have a slower access time than physical memory 
 
Recommended swap size = Twice the size of RAM 
 
Lets say, 
 
M = Amount of RAM in GB, and S = Amount of swap in GB, then 
 
 
If M < 2 
 
then  S = M *2 
 
Else 
S = M + 2 
 
Commands 
 
dd 
 
mkswap 
 
swapon or swapoff 
 
 
Steps to Create Swap Space from Existing Disk: 
If you don’t have any additional disks, you can create a file somewhere on your filesystem, and 
use that file for swap space. 
 
The following dd command example creates a swap file with the name “newswap” under / 
directory with a size of 1024MB (1.0GB). 
 
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/newswap bs=1M count=1024 
 

Where 
if = read from FILE instead of stdin 
of = write to FILE instead of stdout 
bs = read and write BYTES at a time 
count = total size of the file 
 
 
Change the permission of the swap file so that only root can access it. 
# chmod go-r /newswap 
OR 
# chmod 0600 /newswap 
 
 
Make this file as a swap file using mkswap command. 
# mkswap /newswap 
 
 
Enable the newly created newswap. 
# swapon /newswap 
 
 
To make this swap file available as a swap area even after the reboot, add the following line to 
the /etc/fstab file. 
# cat /etc/fstab 
/newswap swap swap defaults 0 
0 
 
 
Verify whether the newly created swap area is available for your use. 
# swapon –s 
# free –h 
 
If you don’t want to reboot to verify whether the system takes all the swap space mentioned in 
the /etc/fstab, you can do the following, which will disable and enable all the swap partition 
mentioned in the /etc/fstab 
# swapoff -a 
# swapon -a
