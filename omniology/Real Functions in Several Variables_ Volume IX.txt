Real Functions in Several Variables: Volume IX 
Transformation of Integrals and Improper Integrals
1347 
Preface
Preface
The topic of this series of books on “Real Functions in Several Variables” is very important in the
description in e.g. Mechanics of the real 3-dimensional world that we live in. Therefore, we start from
the very beginning, modelling this world by using the coordinates of R3 to describe e.g. a motion in
space. There is, however, absolutely no reason to restrict ourselves to R3 alone. Some motions may
be rectilinear, so only R is needed to describe their movements on a line segment. This opens up for
also dealing with R2, when we consider plane motions. In more elaborate problems we need higher
dimensional spaces. This may be the case in Probability Theory and Statistics. Therefore, we shall in
general use Rn as our abstract model, and then restrict ourselves in examples mainly to R2 and R3.
For rectilinear motions the familiar rectangular coordinate system is the most convenient one to apply.
However, as known from e.g. Mechanics, circular motions are also very important in the applications
in engineering. It becomes natural alternatively to apply in R2 the so-called polar coordinates in the
plane. They are convenient to describe a circle, where the rectangular coordinates usually give some
nasty square roots, which are diﬃcult to handle in practice.
Rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates are designed to model each their problems.
They
supplement each other, so diﬃcult computations in one of these coordinate systems may be easy, and
even trivial, in the other one. It is therefore important always in advance carefully to analyze the
geometry of e.g. a domain, so we ask the question: Is this domain best described in rectangular or in
polar coordinates?
Sometimes one may split a problem into two subproblems, where we apply rectangular coordinates in
one of them and polar coordinates in the other one.
It should be mentioned that in real life (though not in these books) one cannot always split a problem
into two subproblems as above.
Then one is really in trouble, and more advanced mathematical
methods should be applied instead. This is, however, outside the scope of the present series of books.
The idea of polar coordinates can be extended in two ways to R3. Either to semi-polar or cylindric
coordinates, which are designed to describe a cylinder, or to spherical coordinates, which are excellent
for describing spheres, where rectangular coordinates usually are doomed to fail. We use them already
in daily life, when we specify a place on Earth by its longitude and latitude! It would be very awkward
in this case to use rectangular coordinates instead, even if it is possible.
Concerning the contents, we begin this investigation by modelling point sets in an n-dimensional
Euclidean space En by Rn.
There is a subtle diﬀerence between En and Rn, although we often
identify these two spaces. In En we use geometrical methods without a coordinate system, so the
objects are independent of such a choice. In the coordinate space Rn we can use ordinary calculus,
which in principle is not possible in En. In order to stress this point, we call En the “abstract space”
(in the sense of calculus; not in the sense of geometry) as a warning to the reader. Also, whenever
necessary, we use the colour black in the “abstract space”, in order to stress that this expression is
theoretical, while variables given in a chosen coordinate system and their related concepts are given
the colours blue, red and green.
We also include the most basic of what mathematicians call Topology, which will be necessary in the
following. We describe what we need by a function.
Then we proceed with limits and continuity of functions and deﬁne continuous curves and surfaces,
with parameters from subsets of R and R2, resp..

Preface
Continue with (partial) diﬀerentiable functions, curves and surfaces, the chain rule and Taylor’s for-
mula for functions in several variables.
We deal with maxima and minima and extrema of functions in several variables over a domain in Rn.
This is a very important subject, so there are given many worked examples to illustrate the theory.
Then we turn to the problems of integration, where we specify four diﬀerent types with increasing
complexity, plane integral, space integral, curve (or line) integral and surface integral.
Finally, we consider vector analysis, where we deal with vector ﬁelds, Gauß’s theorem and Stokes’s
theorem. All these subjects are very important in theoretical Physics.
The structure of this series of books is that each subject is usually (but not always) described by three
successive chapters. In the ﬁrst chapter a brief theoretical theory is given. The next chapter gives
some practical guidelines of how to solve problems connected with the subject under consideration.
Finally, some worked out examples are given, in many cases in several variants, because the standard
solution method is seldom the only way, and it may even be clumsy compared with other possibilities.
I have as far as possible structured the examples according to the following scheme:
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
From high school one is used to immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level, let alone situations in real life, are often so complicated that it in
general will be a good investment also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to
be absolutely certain of what to do in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can
always be executed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. They are not telegram short hands,
and from a logical point of view they usually do not make sense at all! Instead, write in a plain
language what you mean or want to do. This is diﬃcult in the beginning, but after some practice it
becomes routine, and it will give more precise information.
When we deal with multiple integrals, one of the possible pedagogical ways of solving problems has
been to colour variables, integrals and upper and lower bounds in blue, red and green, so the reader
by the colour code can see in each integral what is the variable, and what are the parameters, which

Preface
do not enter the integration under consideration. We shall of course build up a hierarchy of these
colours, so the order of integration will always be deﬁned. As already mentioned above we reserve
the colour black for the theoretical expressions, where we cannot use ordinary calculus, because the
symbols are only shorthand for a concept.
The author has been very grateful to his old friend and colleague, the late Per Wennerberg Karlsson,
for many discussions of how to present these diﬃcult topics on real functions in several variables, and
for his permission to use his textbook as a template of this present series. Nevertheless, the author
has felt it necessary to make quite a few changes compared with the old textbook, because we did not
always agree, and some of the topics could also be explained in another way, and then of course the
results of our discussions have here been put in writing for the ﬁrst time.
The author also adds some calculations in MAPLE, which interact nicely with the theoretic text.
Note, however, that when one applies MAPLE, one is forced ﬁrst to make a geometrical analysis of
the domain of integration, i.e. apply some of the techniques developed in the present books.
The theory and methods of these volumes on “Real Functions in Several Variables” are applied
constantly in higher Mathematics, Mechanics and Engineering Sciences. It is of paramount importance
for the calculations in Probability Theory, where one constantly integrate over some point set in space.
It is my hope that this text, these guidelines and these examples, of which many are treated in more
ways to show that the solutions procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students
who have just started their studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Real Functions in Several Variables: Volume IX 
Transformation of Integrals and Improper Integrals
1351 
Introduction to volume IX
Introduction to volume IX,
Transformation formulæ and improper integrals
This is the ninth volume in the series of books on Real Functions in Several Variables.
In Chapter 29 we investigate how to change variables in the integrals in the plane or space. It is
shown that the previous chapters are special cases of this general theory. In particular, we obtain a
new introduction of the various weight functions. Formally, Chapter 29 would suﬃce for the theory,
but we have chosen for pedagogical reasons to describe separately the plane integral in rectangular
or polar coordinates, the space integral in rectangular, semi-polar or spherical coordinates, the line
integral and the surface integral, because then we can identify the weight function, which should be
used in each case.
In Chapter 30 we look at the cases, where f : A →R is continuous, but A is either unbounded or
not closed. In this case the integrand may tend to ±∞, when x approaches a boundary point. Such
integrals called improper integrals.
One should for improper integrals always split the integrand f into its positive and negative parts,
i.e.
f(x) = f+(x) −f−(x),
where
f+(x) :=



f(x)
if f(x) > 0,
0
if f(x) ≤0,
f−(x) :=



0
if f(x) > 0,
−f(x)
if f(x) ≤0,
where for technical reasons both f+ and f−are nonnegative. Then we discuss the possible deﬁnition
of

A
f(x) dµ,
provided that f(x) ≥0 for all x ∈A,
i.e. for f nonnegative. Or, alternatively, split the domain A = A+ ∪A−, where f > 0 on A+ and
f ≤0 on A−.
If both f+ and f−have ﬁnite values of their (proper or improper) integrals, then we say that

A
f(x) dµ :=

A
f+(x) dµ −

A
f−(x) dµ =

A+
f(x) dµ +

A−
f(x) dµ
(∈R),
is convergent.
All the integrals above, plane, space and surface integrals, can be improper. To decide whether they
are convergent or not, we split them as above and then use a truncation technique and ﬁnally let the
truncations shrink towards the “singular points” on the (intrinsic) boundary of A to see if we have
convergence or divergence.

Transformation of plane and space integrals
29.1
Transformation of a plane integral
We shall in this section see how we can integrate a plane integral by using a change of variables.
Consider two bounded and closed plane sets B, D ⊂R2, and let
r = (r1, r2) : D →R2
be a C1 vector function, which satisﬁes
1) The vector function r maps D onto B, i.e. r(D) = B, so it is surjective.
2) The vector function r is injective almost everywhere.
We use the coordinates (x, y) ∈B and (u, v) ∈D, so we have
x = r1(u, v)
and
y = r2(u, v).
If we consider B as a surface, and not just a plane set, then 
B f(x, y) dS can be viewed as a surface
interal, so we get from Chapter 27 that the reduction formula is

B
f(x, y) dx dy =

D
f (r1(u, v), r2(u, v)) · N(u, v) du dv.
When the plane domain (surface) B is imbedded in R3, we can use the following rectangular descrip-
tion,
B = {(x, y, 0) | x = r1(u, v) and y = r2(u, v) for (u, v) ∈D} .
Then the normal vector N is parallel with the z-axis, and we get
N(u, v) = det

by

Transformation of plane and space integrals
It is for mnemotechnical reasons that we use the old-fashioned notation of the Jacobian. The reason
is that we then remember that intuitively du dv in the “numerator” is “cancelled” by the symbol
“∂(u, v)” in the “denominator”, leaving “∂(x, y)” in the “numerator”, which is more or less the same
as dx dy on the left hand side of the transformation formula. This incorrect notation reminds us that
the Jacobian is a function of (u, v), which is more diﬃcult to derive, when we use a more correct
notation.
As a simple check, let us consider the change from rectangular coordinate in the plane to polar
coordinates, so r is given by
x = ̺ cos ϕ
and
y = ̺ sin ϕ.
Then
∂(x, y)
∂(̺, ϕ) = det

is the area of the parallelogram formed by the tangents of the two parameter curves, this gives us a
clue of what we should expect in three
The analogue in three dimensions is a map r = (r1, r2, r3) : D →B, where we use the notation
(x, y, z) = (r1(u, v, w), r2(u, v, w), r3(u, v, w)) ,

It is well-known from Linear Algebra that the absolute value of the Jacobian is the volume of the
parallelepipidum spanned by the three tangents of the three parameter curves at a given point. In
other words, our parallelepipeda are the building stones, which we use when we build up the 3-
dimensional integral, and their volumes, the absolute value of the Jacobian, form the weight function.
The above makes the following theorem plausible. We quote it – as usual without a correct proof.

where B ⊂R3 and D ⊂R3 are bounded and closed sets. Assume that
r = (r1, r2, r3) : D →R3
is a C1 vector function, such that
1) The vector function r maps D onto B, i.e. r(D) = B, and
x = r1(u, v, w),
y = r2(u, v, w),
z = r3(u, v, w).
2) The function r is injective almost everywhere.
3) The Jacobian is = 0 almost everywhere, i.e.
∂(x, y, z)
∂(u, v, w) := det

If f : B →R is a continuous function, then the reduction formula is

Let us check this formula by transforming the integral in rectangular coordinates into spherical coor-
dinates, i.e. r is here speciﬁed by
x = r sin θ cos ϕ,
y = r sin θ cos ϕ,
z = r cos θ.
Then the Jacobian is

so we have indeed obtained the same weight function as we found in Chapter 24.

Procedures for the transformation of plane or space integrals
All the reduction formulæ in the previous chapters are special cases of more general formulæ. The
presentations were using the classical coordinate systems: the rectangular, polar, semi-polar, and the
spherical coordinate systems. When the coordinate system under consideration is not one of these we
must use the general formulæ form the present section instead.
A. Dimension 2.
1) Find a suitable parameter representation (x, y) = r(u, v), (u, v) ∈D.
Sketch the parametric domain D and argue brieﬂy that r(u, v) is injective, with the exception
of e.g. a ﬁnite number of points. (More precisely one can neglect a so-called null set; which
usually is not deﬁned in elementary courses in Calculus).
Show also that the range is r(D) = B.
2) Calculate the Jacobian
∂(x, y)
∂(u, v) =

∂x
∂u
∂x
∂v
∂y
∂u
∂y
∂v

.
Note here that one is forced to ﬁnd x and y as functions of (u, v) in 1) in order to calculate the
Jacobian.
The area element is
dS = dx dy =

∂(x, y)
∂(u, v)
 du dv,
where the area element dx dy is lying in B, while the area element du dv is lying in the
parametric domain D.
3) Insert the result and calculate the right hand side by previous known methods in the expression

B
f(x, y) dx dy =

D
f(r(u, v))

∂(x, y)
∂(u, v)
 du dv.
Remark 29.1 Usually u and v are given as functions in x and y instead of the form we shall use:
(29.1) u = U(x, y)
and
v = V (x, y).
Then one has to solve these equations with respect to x and y.
If we in this way obtain a
unique solution, then we have at the same time implicitly proved that the map is injective. Apply
furthermore (29.1) to ﬁnd the images of the boundary curves of B, thereby ﬁnding the boundary
of D. Finally, the parametric domain D is identiﬁed. ♦

B. Dimension 3.
Formally the procedure is the same as in section A with obvious modiﬁcations due to the higher
dimension.
1) Find a suitable parametric representation (x, y, z) = r(u, v, w), (u, v, w) ∈D. (This will usually
be given, possibly in the form u = U(x, y, z), v = V (x, y, z), w = W(x, y, z). If so, solve these
equations with respect to x, y, z).
Sketch the parametric domain D and argue (brieﬂy) that the mapping r(u, v, w) is injective
almost everywhere.
Show that the range is r(D) = B. Cf. also the remarks to section A.
2) Calculate the Jacobian
∂(x, y, z)
∂(u, v, w) =

∂x

Then the volume element is
dΩ= dx dy dz =

∂(x, y, z)
∂(u, v, w)
 du dv dw,
where one must be careful not to forget the numerical signs of the Jacobian.
3) Insert and calculate the right hand side by means of one of the previous methods in the formula

f(x, y, z) dx dy dz =

coordinates. Therefore, the only possibility left is to ﬁnd a convenient transform, such that the
integrand becomes more easy to handle.

The unpleasant thing is of course the fraction y −x
y + x. One idea would be to introduce the numerator
as a new variable, and the denominator as another new variable. If we do this, then we must show
that we obtain a unique correspondence between the domain B and a parametric domain D, which
also should be found. Finally we shall ﬁnd the Jacobian. When we have found all the terms in the
transformation formula, then calculate the integral.

Transformation of plane and space integrals
Remark 29.2 This time we see that it is here quite helpful to start the discussion in D, which is
not common knowledge from high school. First we discuss the problem. Based on this discussion
we make a decision on the further procedure. ♦
I. According to D. we choose the numerator and the denominator as our new variables. Most people
would here choose the numerator as u and the denominator as v, so we shall do the same, although
it can be shown that we shall get simpler calculations if we interchange the deﬁnition of u and v.
We therefore put as the most natural choice
(29.2) numerator :
u = y −x
and
denominator :
v = y + x.
Then we shall prove that this gives a one-to-one correspondence. This means that we for any
given u and v obtain unique solutions x and y:
x = v −y
2
and
y = u + v
2
.
Obviously the transform is continuous both ways. Since B is closed and bounded, the range D by
this transform is again closed and bounded, cf. the important second main theorem for continuous
functions.
Since the transform is one-to-one everywhere, the boundary ∂B is mapped one-to-one onto the
boundary ∂D. This is expressed in the following way:
1) The line x + y = 1 corresponds by (29.2) to v = 1.
2) The line y = x, i.e. y −x = 0, corresponds by (29.2) to u = 0.
3) The line y + x = 4 corresponds by (29.2) to v = 4.
4) The line y = 3x corresponds to u + v

The only closed and bounded domain in the (u, v)-plane, which has the new boundary curves as its
boundary is D as indicated on the ﬁgure. In practice one draws the lines v = 1, u = 0, v = 4 and

v = 2u and use the ﬁgure to ﬁnd out where the bounded set D is situated, such that the boundary
consists of parts of all four lines.
Then we calculate the weight function

∂(x, y)
∂(u, v)
.
The “old fashioned” notation above indicates that we shall use the transform, where x and y (in
the “numerator”) are functions of u and v (in the “denominator”), i.e.
x = 1
2 v −1
2 u
and
y = 1
2 u + 1
2 v.
This gives us the Jacobian

Remark 29.3 If we here interchange u and v in (29.2), then we obtain that the Jacobian becomes
positive. ♦

Figure 29.3: The domain A. Note the diﬀerent scales on the axes.
D. Let us start by pulling out the teeth of this big and horrible example! Its purpose is only to
demonstrate that even apparent incalculable integrals in some cases nevertheless can be calculated
by using a “convenient transform”. This example is from a textbook, where earlier students got the
wrong impression that “every application of the transformation theorem looks like this example”,
which is not true. Without this extra comment this example will send a wrong message to the
reader.
Let us ﬁrst discuss, how we can ﬁnd a reasonable transform. I shall follow more or less the way of
thinking which the author of this example must have used, the ﬁrst time it was created.
At the end of this example I shall describe the very modest requirements which may be demanded
of the students. In other words, this example should only be used as an inspiration for other
similar problems which may occur in practice.
I. Let us start by looking at the geometry of A. The projection B of A onto the (x, y)-plane is
B = {(x, y) | 0 ≤x ≤1, 0 ≤y ≤√x}.
Since A for every x ∈]0, 1] is cut into an isosceles rectangular triangle
∆x = {(y, z) | 0 ≤y ≤√x, −y ≤z ≤y},
it is easy to sketch A, cf. a previous ﬁgure.

u = y + z.
Remark 29.4 Once we have gone through all the calculations it can be seen that
˜u = y + z
2
,
would be a better choice, because then we would get rid of a lot of irritating constants.
Of
pedagogical reasons we shall not here use the most optimal transform, but instead the transform
which one would expect the student to choose. ♦
Since we do not get further information from the integrand, we shall turn to the domain A. The
boundary of A is (almost) determined by putting equality sign into the deﬁnition of A instead of
≤. First everything is written in a “binary” way in the deﬁnition of A,
A
=
{(x, y, z) | 0 ≤x ≤1 ∧0 ≤y ≤√x ∧−y ≤z ≤y}
=
{(x, y, z) | 0 ≤x ∧x ≤1 ∧0 ≤y ∧0 ≤√x −y ∧0 ≤y + z ∧0 ≤y −z},
i.e. every condition which is deﬁning A contains only one inequality sign and one of the sides of
the inequality is a constant.
We see that there are composed expressions in the latter three conditions,
√x −y ≥0,
y + z ≥0,
y −z ≥0.
Since we already have chosen u = y + z ≥0, we get the inspiration of choosing the new variables
(29.3) u = y + z ≥0,
v = y −z ≥0,
w = √x −y ≥0,

Transformation of plane and space integrals
where we have taken the most ugly term, √x −y and put it equal to w, i.e.
w = √x −y.
We note that we by these choices have obtained that u, v, w ≥0, and that equality signs must
correspond to boundary points in the (u, v, w)-space for the parametric domain D.
Next we show that the transform (29.3) is one-to-one. i.e. we shall express x, y, z uniquely by u,
v, w. We get immediately from the ﬁrst two equations that
y = u + v
2
and
z = u −v
2
.
From the third equation we get
√x = w + y = w + u + v
2
= 1
2 (u + v + 2w),
which obviously is ≥0, because u, v, w ≥0. Therefore, by squaring,
x = 1
4 (u + v + 2w)2.
Thus, x, y, z are uniquely determined by u, v, w, so the transform is one-to-one.
Since the transform and its inverse are both continuous and the domain A is closed and bounded, it
follows from the second main theorem for continuous functions that D is also closed and bounded.
It follows from the binary representation of A that ∂A is a subset of the union of the surfaces
x = 0, x = 1, y = 0, √x −y = 0, y + z <= 0 and y −z = 0. These are now investigated one by
one.

Since u, v, w ≥0, we only get
(u, v, w) = (0, 0, 0), which is in agreement with the ﬁgure of A, because the plane x = 0 just
cuts A in 0.

This is only 0 for (u, v, w) = (0, 0, 0) in D, i.e. in just one point, which is a null-set (without

Remark 29.5 It is obvious from this example, that the application of transformation theorems is
not an easy job. Therefore, one will usually be given the transform which should be applied,
u = f(x, y, z),
v = g(x, y, z),
w = h(x, y, z).
Then the task for the reader can be described in the following points:
1) Solve the equations after x, y, z, (from this follows automatically that the transform is one-to-one),
x = F(u, v, w),
y = G(u, v, w),
z = H(u, v, w).
2) Identify the parametric domain; use here the second main theorem and that a boundary in most
cases by a continuous transform again is mapped into a part of the boundary.
3) Calculate the weight function

∂(x, y, z)
∂(u, v, w)
 from the expressions found in 1).
4) Reduce the integrand
Φ(x, y, z) = Φ(F, G, H) = Ψ(u, v, w);
5) Set up the abstract reduction formula,

A
Φ(x, y, z) dx dy dz =

B
Ψ(u, v, w)

∂(x, y, z)
∂(u, v, w)
 du dv dw.
6) Reduce the right hand side of 5) by known methods, usually in rectangular coordinates, though
semi-polar coordinates may occur, and calculate the value of the resulting integral.

I It follows from 5x = u2 + v2 and 2y = uv that
5x + 4y = u2 + v2 + 2uv = (u + v)2,
5x −4y = u2 + v2 −2uv = (u −v)2.
Since |v| ≤u, we get from this
u + v = +

5x + 4y
and
u −v = +

5x −4y,
hence
u =

u =

and
v =

so this boundary curve is transformed into v = 1

2) If y = 0, x ∈

5x ∈[0, 2].
3) If ﬁnally 5x = 4 + y2, y ∈[0, 1], then
4 + y2 = u2 + v2
and
4y = 2uv,
i.e.
(u + v)2 = (y + 2)2
and
(u −v)2 = (2 −y)2,
thus
u + v = y + 2 ≥0
and
u −v = 2 −y ≥0,
or u = 2 and v = y ∈[0, 1]. Then we can sketch the new domain (a triangle).

Figure 29.17: The domain B.
I If y = 0, x > 0, then v = 0 and x = u, hence the segment on the X-axis is transformed onto a
segment on the U-axis.
If y = 1
2 x, then u sinh v = 1

tanh v = 1
2 = ev −e−v
ev + e−v = e2v −1
e2v + 1,
or e2v + 1 = 2 e2v −2, thus e2v = 3, and hence v = 1
2 ln 3, and u is a “free” variable.
If x2 −y2 = 1 x > 0, then u2 = 1, and since u > 0, we must have u = 1.
If x2 −y2 = 4, x > 0, then u2 = 4, and since u > 0, we must have u = 2.

a) x + y ≥1 is transformed into u ≥1,
b) 2y −x ≤2 is transformed into u −3v ≤4,
c) y −2x ≥−2 is transformed into u + 3v ≤4.
We get by a rearrangement, u −4 ≤3v ≤4 −u, hence u ≤4, and
D = {(u, v) | 1 ≤u ≤4, u −4 ≤3v ≤4 −u}.
We can here exploit that it is given that B is a triangle and thus bounded. The transformation
(29.13) is continuous, so D is connected an bounded, and then we can sketch the three boundary
lines and identify the image as the bounded part.

Figure 29.19: The domain B.
I 1) Let us ﬁrst ﬁnd the intersection point of the boundary curves of B.
a) If y = e−x = 2ex, then x = −1
2 ln 2 and hence y =

2.
b) If y = ex = 2e−x, then x = 1
2 ln 2 and hence y =

2.
c) The remaining two intersection points are immediately seen to be (0, 1) and (0, 2).
Then it is easy to sketch the domain B, even if one does not have MAPLE at hand.
2) By the change of variables u = y ex and v = y e−x,
a) y = ex and x ∈

is transformed into v = 1 and u = e2x ∈[1, 2],
b) y = 2e−x and x ∈

is transformed into u = 2 and v = 2e2x ∈[1, 2],
c) y = 2ex and x ∈

d) y = e−x and x ∈

is transformed into u = 1 and v = e−2x ∈[1, 2].
Thus we get the new domain D = [1, 2] × [1, 2] in the (U, V )-plane.
3) Then we ﬁnd x and y as functions of u and v:

Transformation of plane and space integrals
Example 29.15 Let A denote the tetrahedron, which is bounded by the four planes of the equations
x + y = 1,
y + z = 1,
z + x = 1,
x + y + z = 1.

I =

A

by introducing the new variables
u = 1 −x −y,
v = 1 −y −z,
w = 1 −z −x.
A Transformation of a space integral.
Find the Jacobian and the limits of u, v and w.

2.
The integrand is
(x + y)(y + z) = (1 −u)(1 −v).
Considering the limits of u, v and w we see that
x + y = 1
corresponds to
u = 1 −x −y = 0,
y + z = 1
corresponds to
v = 1 −y −z = 0,
z + x = 1
corresponds to
w = 1 −z −x = 0.
From
u + v + w = 3 −2(x + y + z),
follows that
x + y + z = 1
corresponds to
u + v + w = 1.
Finally, the tetrahedron lies in the ﬁrst octant of the XY Z-space, where x + y ≤1, y + z ≤1 and
z + x ≤1. Hence the domain in the UV W-space is
B
=
{(u, v, w) | u ≥0, v ≥0, w ≥0, u + v + w ≤1}
=
{(u, v, w) | 0 ≤u ≤1, 0 ≤v ≤1 −u, 0 ≤w ≤1 −u −v}.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air.

Real Functions in Several Variables: Volume IX 
Transformation of Integrals and Improper Integrals

Transformation of plane and space integrals
Example 29.16 Let A be the closed point set in R3, which is bounded by the four elliptic paraboloids
of the equations

z = 3

(3)
z = −1 + 1

(4)
z = −2 + 1

2 y2.
The point set A intersects the ZX-plane in a point set B1, and the Y Z-plane in a point set B2.
1) Sketch B1 and B2.
2) Calculate the volume Vol(A) and the space integral

where
u, v ∈[0, +∞[,

Figure 29.21: The set B2 is the union of the two “oblique” quadrilateral sets.
I 1) By putting y = 0, we get in the XZ-plane the four parabolas
z = 3
2 −1
6 x2,
z = 1
2 −1
2 x2,
z = −1 + 1
4 x2,
z = −2 + 1
8 x2,
and it is easy to sketch B1.
By putting x = 0, we get in the Y Z-plane
z = 3
2 −2
3 y2,
z = 1
2 −2y2,
z = −1 + y2,
z = −2 + 1
2 y2,
and it is easy to sketch B2.
2) Let
x = √uv cos w,
y = 1
2
√uv sin w,
z = 1
2 (u −v),
where u, v ≥0 and w ∈[0, 2π]. We shall ﬁrst ﬁnd the image of A by this transformation.
a) By insertion into the boundary surface
z = 3
2 −1
6 x2 −2
3 y2
we get
1
2 (u −v) = 3
2 −1
6 uv cos2 w −1
6 uv sin2 w = 3
2 −1
6 uv,
hence 3(u −v) = 9 −uv, which is reformulated as
uv + 3u = u(v + 3) = 9 + 3v = 3(v + 3).
It follows from v ≥0 that u = 3, hence this boundary surface is mapped into a part of the
plane u = 3.

b) By insertion into the boundary surface
z = 1
2 −1
2 x2 −2y2
we get
1
2 (u −v) = 1
2 −1
2 uv cos2 w −1
2 uv sin2 w = 1
2 −1
2 uv,
i.e. u −v = 1 −uv, and thus
uv + u = u(v + 1) = v + 1.
From v ≥0 follows that u = 1, hence the boundary surface is mapped into a part of the
plane u = 1.
c) We get by insertion into the boundary surface
z = −1 + 1
4 x2 + y2
that
1
2 (u −v) = −1 + 1
4 uv cos2 w + 1
4 uv sin2 w = −1 + 1
4 uv,
thus 2(u −2) = uv −4, and hence
uv + 2v = v(u + 2) = 2u + 4 = 2(u + 2).
It follows from u ≥0 that v = 2, so the boundary surface is mapped into a part of the plane
v = 2.
d) We get by insertion into the boundary surface
z = −2 + 1
8 x2 + 1
2 y2
that
1
2 (u −v) = −2 + 1
8 uv cos2 w + 1
8 uv sin2 w = −2 + 1
8 uv,
thus 4(u −v) = −16 + uv, and hence
uv + 4v = v(u + 4) = 4u + 16 = 4(u + 4).
It follows from u ≥0 that v = 4, so the boundary surface is mapped into a part of the plane
v = 4.
The only condition on w is that (cos w, sin w) shall encircle the unit circle only once, so w ∈
[0, 2π].
By the transformation A is mapped onto the set
B = [1, 3] × [2, 4] × [0, 2π].

Transformation of plane and space integrals
Example 29.17 We can write the formula of transformation of a space integral in the following way,

˜Ω
f(˜x) d˜Ω=

Ω
f(˜x(x)) |J(x)| dΩ,
where J is the determinant of that matrix, the elements of which are
∂˜xi
∂xj
,
i, j ∈{1, 2, 3}.
We shall in particular interpret ˜Ωas created from Ωby a translation and a deformation. This means
that to the point x we let correspond a point ˜x given by
˜x = x + u(x),
where u is the displacement vector ﬁeld. When u is a constant vector, we get a translation. However,
in general u varies in space (as indicated by the notation), such that we have a combination of a
translation and a deformation.
1. Compute J(x, y, z) by introducing u = (ux, uy, uz).
In the Theory of Elasticity the deformations are often small in the sense that the derivative of u is
small, so we can reject all there products.
2. Prove that by this assumption, J = 1 + div u.
3. Finally, prove that the divergence is the relative increase of the volume corresponding to the defor-
mation.
A Transformation of space integrals.
D Calculate the ﬁrst approximation of the Jacobian.
I 1) The transformation is given by
˜x1 = x + ux(x),

x = (x, y, z),

Transformation of plane and space integrals
2) If we remove all products of higher order, then we get
J = 1 + div u.
3) The geometrical interpretation of J is given by
d˜Ω= |J(x)| dΩ,
where d˜Ωand dΩare considered as inﬁnitesimal volumes corresponding to each other. This
may possibly be clariﬁed by
∆˜Ω≈|J(x)| ∆Ω.
Assume that div u is small, so higher order terms can be rejected. Then
J = 1 + div u > 0,
and thus
d˜Ω= {1 + div u} dΩ.
The factor 1 + div u indicates the quotient between the two inﬁnitesimal volumes, so div u
can be interpreted as the relative signed increase of the volume.

Furthermore, B is closed and bounded, so by using the second main theorem for continuous
functions we conclude that the image, i.e. the new parametric domain A in the (u, v)-plane is also
closed and bounded. It therefore suﬃces to ﬁnd the images of the boundary curves.
1) x = 0 is mapped into u + v = 0, i.e. into v = −u.
2) y = 0 is mapped into u −v = 0, i.e. into v = u.
3) x + y = 1 is mapped into u = 1.
It follows that A in the (u, v)-plane is the triangle which is deﬁned by these three lines, hence
A = {(u, v) | 0 ≤u ≤1, −u ≤v ≤u}.

into a new tetrahedron B as indicated on the ﬁgure. Note that B is cut at the height w ∈[0, 1[ in
the triangle
B(w) = {(u, v) | u ≥0, v ≥0, u + v ≤2(1 −w)}.
This can be exploited in the calculation of the transformed integral by the method of slicing.

The boundary surface in each of the planes x = 0, y = 0 and z = 0 is indicated on the ﬁgure.
Then check the image in the (u, v, w)- space of each of the boundary surfaces in the (x, y, z)-space.
Clearly, the boundary surface x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 is mapped into u2 + v2 + z2 = 1, and they both lie
in the ﬁrst octant.

Improper integrals

Improper integrals
30.1
Introduction
In some cases it is possible to extend the various forms of integrals considered in the previous volumes
to situations which are not covered by the theorems already given. We considered earlier (abstract)
integrals symbolized by

A
f(x) dµ,
where A is closed and bounded, and the function f : A →R is continuous. We shall in this chapter
investigate what can be done if these conditions above are not all fulﬁlled.
Let us start with a useful technical trick, which will be very important in the discussion below. We
shall split the function f under consideration into its positive part f+ and its negative part f−, and
then continue by only discussing the case where f is nonnegative.
Given any function f : A →R, we deﬁne f+ and f−in the following way,
f+(x) :=



f(x),
if f(x) > 0,
0,
if f(x) =≤0,
f−(x) :=



−f(x),
if f(x) < 0,
0,
if f(x) ≥0.
Then clearly both f+ and f−are nonnegative, and
f(x) = f+(x) −f−(x)
and
f+(x) · f−(x) = 0
for all x ∈A.
Furthermore, the splitting of f, satisfying the two conditions above, is unique.
Now, if we can prescribe (ﬁnite) values of both

A f+(x) dµ and

A f−(x) dµ, then we simply deﬁne
the value of the improper integral

A f(x) dµ by putting

A
f(x) dµ =

A
f+(x) dµ −

A
f−(x) dµ.
This means that we in the following only shall consider nonnegative integrands, f ≥0, when we
extend the plane, space, line or surface integrals to the case of improper integrals, where either f is
not continuous, or A is either not bounded or not closed.
Once we have restricted the investigation to nonnegative functions f ≥0, the idea of deﬁning the
improper integral

A f(x) dµ goes as follows. We choose a sequence of nested closed and bounded sets,
i.e.
A1 ⊂A2 ⊂· · · ⊂An ⊂· · · ⊂A,
such that the given nonnegative function f is continuous on every An, and such that An →A in some
sense for n →+∞. Since f is continuous on every An, and An is closed and bounded, the integral of
f over each An does indeed exist, and since f ≥0 is nonnegative, and the sequence An is nested, i.e.
An ⊂An+1 for every n ∈N, we conclude that the sequence

A1
f(x) dµ ≤

Improper integrals
of real numbers is (weakly) increasing, hence it is either convergent, or tending towards +∞. This is
the reason for only considering nonnegative functions.
It is not hard to see that any nested increasing sequence of closed and bounded subsets of A, on which
f ≥0 is continuous, will do. We still have to explain, what is meant by An →A for n →+∞.
If
+∞

n=1
An = A,
then the immediate deﬁnition of the improper integral of f over A becomes

A
f(x) dµ =
lim
n→+∞

An
f(x) dµ.
If the limit is convergent towards the value I ∈R, we say that the improper integral is convergent and

A
f(x) dµ = I.
If the limit is +∞, we say that the improper integral is divergent.

Improper integrals
However, measures are only determined modulo null sets, so we may weaken the deﬁnition to the
requirement that only
+∞

n=1
An = A \ M,
where µ(M) = 0,
i.e.
M is a null set.
Then we can still use the deﬁnitions above of the improper integral, because the “missing values”
from f(x) over the null set M have by deﬁnition only the weight 0, so we only exclude 0.
30.2
Theorems for proper integrals
A further analysis of the improper integrals shows that we can divide those considered here into two
types, which may not be disjoint,
1) Unbounded continuous integrand.
2) Unbounded domain of integration.
Only these cases will be relevant for us, although the classiﬁcation above is not complete. There exist
improper integrals, which cannot be broken down to a ﬁnite number of cases of the types above, but
they will be outside the realm of this chapter.
The proofs of the following theorems have already been sketched in Section 30.1. We shall be satisﬁed
with these sketches and not bother with more precise proofs.

Theorem 30.1 . Improper integral with unbounded integrand. Let A ⊂Rk be a bounded set,
and let M ⊂A be a null set, µ(M) = 0. Assume that
f : A \ M →[0, +∞[
is a nonnegative continuous and unbounded function. Choose an increasing (nested) sequence of sets
A1 ⊂A2 ⊂· · · ⊂An ⊂· · · ⊂A,
such that
M ⊂A \ An
for all n ∈N,
and
µ (A \ An) →0

Then either

Procedure for improper integrals; bounded domain
Problem 30.1 Calculate the integral

A
f(x) dS,
where the domain A is bounded, and where either A is not closed, or the integrand f(x) is not deﬁned
for all x ∈A.
We choose in this description for convenience A ⊂R2. The procedure is analogous for any A ⊂Rk.
Idea: Approximate

A f(x) dS by

An f(x) dS, where
1) The function f(x) is continuous for all x ∈An.
2) All sets An ⊂A are closed and bounded, n ∈N.
3) area(A \ An) →0 for n →+∞.
Remark 30.1 Even if we are approaching the solution by this idea, it is not enough. We shall below
supply it with some suﬃcient conditions in the description of the procedure. ♦
Procedure.
1) Examine whether f(x) has a continuous extension F(x) to A. If this is the case, then

A
f(x) dS =

A
F(x) dS,
where the right hand side is calculated by well-known methods, and the problem is solved.
2) If f(x) does not have a continuous extension to A, we continue by an analysis of the sign of f(x).
This step is extremely important! Divide A into two subsets
A+ = {(x, y) ∈A | f(x, y) ≥0}
and
A−= {(x, y) ∈A | f(x, y) ≤0}.
If f(x, y) is continuous where it is deﬁned, then this division is most easily performed by ﬁnding
the null curves i.e. the curves where f(x, y) = 0.
These curves divide the domain into open
sub-domains. Due to the continuity the sign of f is constant in each of these sub-domains, so in
order to ﬁnd the sign one just has to apply f to one point in each sub-domain. The curves where
f(x, y) = 0 can afterwards be included in any of the two sets A+ or A−, and even in both of them,
because since the integrand is 0 on these curves they will not contribute the the ﬁnal result.
3) Let us ﬁrst consider A+. If A+ = ∅, then go to 4) below. If on the other hand A+ = ∅, we choose
a convenient increasing sequence of closed and bounded subsets A+
ε ⊂A+, such that
area(A+ \ A+

for ε →0 + .

Procedure for improper integrals; unbounded domain
Problem 30.2 Calculate the integral

A
f(x, y) dS,
where the domain of integration A ⫅R2 is unbounded.
Procedure:
1) Examine whether f has a continuous extension to A \ {∞}. If this is not the case, remove suitable
bounded neighbourhoods of the “sick” points, and treat each of these neighbourhoods as previously.
The residual set which we here denote by A is then treated in the following way.
2) The important analysis of the sign of the integrand. Divide A into the two sets
A+ = {(x, y) ∈A | f(x, y) ≥0}
and
A−= {(x, y) ∈A | f(x, y) ≤0}.
The sets A+ and A−are found by analyzing the null curves, i.e. the set deﬁned by the equation
f(x, y) = 0.
3) Let us ﬁrst consider A+. If A+ = ∅, then go to 4) in the following.
If A+ = ∅, we choose one of the possible methods of trimming the set
a) Rectangular:
A+
n = [−n, n]2 ∩A+,
b) Polar:
A+
R = K(0; R) ∩A+,
and we calculate
a) Rectangular:
I+
n =

A+
n
f(x, y) dS,
b) Polar:
I+
R =

A+
R
f(x, y) dS.
If I+
n →+∞for n →+∞, resp. I+
R →+∞for R →+∞, then the improper integral is divergent.
Otherwise,
a) Rectangular:

A+ f(x, y) dS = limn→+∞

A+
n f(x, y) dS.
b) Polar:

A+ f(x, y) dS = limR→+∞

A+
R f(x, y) dS.
Then go to 4).
4) Next turn to A−. If A−= ∅, then go to 5).
If A−= ∅, choose one of the trimming possibilities
a) Rectangular:
A−
n = [−n, n]2 ∩A−,
b) Polar:
A−
R = K(0; R) ∩A−,

Improper integrals
If I−
n →−∞for n →+∞, resp. I−
R →−∞for R →+∞, then the improper integral is divergent.
Otherwise,
a) Rectangular:

A−f(x, y) dS = limn→+∞

A−
n f(x, y) dS.
b) Polar:

A−f(x, y) dS = limR→+∞

A−
R f(x, y) dS.
5) If we obtain convergence in both 3) and 4), then the improper integral is convergent with the value

A
f(x, y) dS =

A+ f(x, y) dS +

A−f(x, y) dS.
Remark 30.2 If we put
A0 = {(x, y) ∈A | f(x, y) = 0},
it is seen that

A0 f(x, y) dS =

A0 0 dS = 0,
so it is of no importance whether we include A0 in our calculations, or not. The contribution from A0
is always 0. ♦

Examples of improper integrals
Example 30.1
A. Let B = [0, 1]2 be the unit square. Examine whether the improper plane integral
I =

B
1
y −x −1 dS
is convergent. If this is the case, ﬁnd its value.
D. The domain B is closed and bounded; but the integrand is not deﬁned in all points of B. Cut away
open neighbourhoods of the points where the integrand is not deﬁned; note that the integrand does
not change sign; calculate the integral over any of the truncated domains and ﬁnally go to the
limit.
I. The denominator must never be zero, so we have to avoid the line y = x + 1. This line cuts B at
the point (0, 1), which must be removed from the domain of integration.
Then we realize that
1
y −x −1 < 0 everywhere in B \ {(0, 1)}, hence the integrand does not
change sign in the part of B, where it is deﬁned. Therefore we shall not further divide the domain
according to the positive and the negative part of the integrand.
Our next step is to truncate B, such that the singular point (0, 1) does not lie in any of the closed
and bounded domains B(ε), and such that
areal(B \ B(ε)) →0
for ε →0.

Figure 30.1: The domain B with the oblique singular line y = x + 1 and the singular point (0, 1), and
a convenient truncation parallel to the Y -axis.
The most reasonable truncations among many possibilities are given by
B(ε) = [ε, 1] × [0, 1]
and
˜B(ε) = [0, 1] × [ε, 1],
for 0 < ε < 1. We shall here choose the ﬁrst one. Then by a reduction,

 1
0
1
y−x −1 dy = [ln |y −x −1| ]1
0 = ln | −x| −ln | −x −1| = ln x −ln(x + 1).
Then insert the result followed by a partial integration,

(x + 1) ·
1
x + 1 dx.
The clever trick is here to choose

dx = x in the ﬁrst partial integration, and

dx = x + 1 in
the second one. In fact, the antiderivatives are only determined modulo a constant. By this trick
we get
I(ε)
=
1 · ln 1 −ε ln ε −2 ln 2 + (1 + ε) ln(1 + ε)
=
−2 ln 2 −ε · ln ε = (1 + ε) ln(1 + ε).
Since area B \ B(ε) = ε →0 for ε →0+, this is the right limit. It follows from the magnitude of
functions that
ε ln ε →0
for ε →0+,

C. A very weak control. The integrand is negative, where it is deﬁned. Hence the result should also
be negative, which is seen to be true. (Note that this is only catching errors, where we end up
with a positive result. Negative wrong results cannot be traced in this way). ♦

D. Surface integrals can also be improper!
In the formulation of the task there is a hint of using spherical coordinates; though there exist also
quite reasonable variants of solutions in semi-polar and rectangular coordinates.
The points where the integrand is not deﬁned lie on the circle
{(x, y, 0) | x2 + y2 = a2}
in the (x, y)-plane. Hence by the truncations we shall stay away from the (x, y)-plane. On the
residual part of the surface we see that the integrand 1
z > 0, so no further division of the domain
is needed concerning the sign of the integrand.
I 1. Spherical coordinates. In this case we truncate F to F(ε) by
F(ε) :
r = a,
0 ≤θ ≤π
2 −ε,
0 ≤ϕ ≤2π,
where 0 < ε < π
2 .
A geometrical consideration gives that
area(F \ F(ε)) →0
for ε →0+,
and as mentioned in D. the integrand is positive, so we shall not divide the domain further.

Since sin ε →0+ for ε →0+, we have ln sin ε →−∞for ε →0+, i.e. I(ε) →−(−∞) = +∞for
ε →0+, and the improper surface integral is divergent.

F :
0 ≤z ≤a
and
̺ =

i.e. ̺2 + z2 = a2, ̺ ≥0. The surface is truncated in the following way,

̺ =

where 0 < ε < a,
and it follows geometrically that area (F \ F(ε)) →0 for ε →0+.

D. Dimensional considerations are here extremely useful. In fact, x, y ∼a and

B · · · dS ∼a2, hence
J(α) ∼a2α · a2 = a2(α+1).
In order to get convergence we must have
a2(α+1) →0
for a →0+,
i.e. α + 1 > 1, or α > −1. Since
a2(α+1) →+∞
for a →0+, when α < −1,
we may expect divergence in this case. (A rough argument is the following: The integral of a
positive term tends to +∞, when the domain is shrunk. This is only possible, when we start with
the value +∞, i.e. with divergence).
The integral is proper, when α ≥0, and it is improper when α < 0. When the integrand is deﬁned,
it is positive, so we shall not bother with an extra division of the domain according to the positive
and negative part of the integrand.
If α < 0, then the integrand is not deﬁned on the boundary (the circle) x2 + y2 = a2.
The considerations above indicate that the value α = −1 divides convergence and divergence. For
that reason we start by ﬁrst examining this case.
I. When we truncate, it is of no importance whether the integral is proper or improper. Since the
integrand is positive (of ﬁxed sign) we shall not make any further division of the domain. We
truncate by the deﬁnition
B(p) = {(x, y) | x2 + y2 ≤(p a)2},
0 < p < 1,
and we note that area{B \ B(p)} →0 for p →1−.

Improper integrals
Example 30.4
A. In advanced technical literature one often sees the improper 1-dimensional integral
 ∞
0
e−x2 dx.
Obvious applications can be found in Probability and Statistics (the normal distribution); but one
can also ﬁnd it in many other places (the heat equation, diﬀusion). We shall ﬁnd the value of this
important integral.
D. The integral cannot be calculated by methods from the elementary calculus. It is fairly easy to
prove that it is convergent. In fact, if we introduce the function
f(t) = (1 + t)e−t
with f ′(t) = −t e−t < 0
for t > 0,
then it follows, because f(t) is decreasing for t > 0, that we have
(1 + t) e−t ≤f(0) = 1,
i.e.
e−t ≤
1
1 + t for t ≥0.
If we put t = x2, we get
e−x2 ≤

1 + x2 ,
hence
0 <
 n
0
e−x2 dx ≤
 n
0
dx
1 + x2 = Arctan n →π
2
for n →+∞.
This proves the convergence, and also the estimate
(0 ≤)
 ∞
0
e−x2 dx ≤π
2 .
However, we still have not found the exact value.
We shall show that it is possible to ﬁnd the value by using methods from the Theory of Functions
in Several Variables. The trick is instead to consider the improper plane integral
I =

B
exp(−x2 −y2) dS,
where B = [0, +∞[ 2 is the ﬁrst quadrant.
The integrand is deﬁned and positive everywhere, so we shall not make any further division of the
domain according to the sign of the integrand.
The domain of integration is unbounded, so we must truncate it in a bounded way. We have
two obvious possibilities of doing this, depending on whether we consider polar or rectangular
coordinates. The idea is to use both of them, because we by using the polar coordinates obtain
the value of the integral I, and by using the rectangular coordinates we obtain the connection to
the integral under consideration.

Improper integrals
Example 30.5
A. Examine whether the improper plane integral

R2
xy
(1 + x2)(1 + y2) dS
is convergent or divergent.
D. An analysis of the sign shows that the integrand is positive in the ﬁrst and the third quadrant,
while it is negative in the second and the fourth quadrant, so we shall also divide the domain
according to the sign. Here we shall also demonstrate the wrong argument where one forgets to
divide according to the sign of the integrand. This shows that one has to be careful here.
I. We see that the integrand changes its sign if we reﬂect it in either the x-axis or in the y-axis. This
shows that the integral over any bounded set B, which is symmetric with respect to at least one
of the axes, is 0,

B
xy
(1 + x2)(1 + y2) dS = 0.
The usual truncations in discs or centred squares satisfy this symmetry with respect to both axes,
so if one is not too careful one will erroneously conclude in the limit that the plane integral is
“convergent with the value limn→∞0 = 0”.

Figure 30.6: The truncation B(n) for n = 1.
We shall prove that this conclusion is not correct. We choose this time the truncation
B(n) = [0, n] × [0, n],
i.e. we only consider a subset of the set, where the integrand is ≥0. If something goes wrong here
in the ﬁrst quadrant, then it also is wrong in any bigger subset of [0, n]2 ∪[−n, 0]2.
By reduction over B(n) we get

This shows that the improper integral is divergent, thus our ﬁrst argument must be wrong! (Of
the type ∞−∞).
Remark 30.5 We shall demonstrate how wrong this illegal method is. If we choose the “skew”
truncation
Q(a, n) = [−a n, n] × [−an, n],

we still get R2 by taking the limit n →+∞. We get by a rectangular reduction,

Improper integrals
Every calculation is correct. The only thing which is wrong is that the assumptions of taking the
limit (with respect to the conclusion of convergence) are not satisﬁed. We note that {ln a}2 go
through the whole interval [0, +∞[, when a go through R+, which means that we can obtain any
q ≥0 as a candidate for a limit of the improper plane integral, which is nonsense.
If we instead use the truncations
R(a, n) = [−n, an] × [−an, n],
a > 0 constant,
we obtain analogously all negative numbers as possible limits. But if the limit exists, then it is
unique! Hence the improper plane integral is divergent. ♦

A Improper surface integrals.
D Analyze why the integral is improper. Since the integrands are ≥0 in all cases, we shall only ﬁnd
some nice truncations of the surface.
I 1) Since |z| ≤a on S, the integrand is
1
a −z > 0 on S \ {(0, 0, a)}. The integrand tends towards
+∞, when (x, y, z) →(0, 0, a) on S.
When we use spherical coordinates on S,
x = a cos ϕ · sin θ,
y = a sin ϕ · sin θ,
z = a cos θ,
for
ϕ ∈[0, 2π],
θ ∈[0, π],
it is well-known that
dS = a2 sin θ dϕ dθ.
The singular point (0, 0, a) corresponds to θ = 0, hence we choose the truncation θ ∈[ε, π],
where ε > 0 corresponds to the subsurface Sε. When we integrate over Sε we get

and the improper surface integral is divergent.
2) In this case the integrand is > 0 on S0, where S0 is the set of points on S, which is not contained
in the XY -plane, where the integrand is not deﬁned. We use again spherical coordinates. Due
to the symmetry it suﬃces to consider the domain

(The values shall not be computed).
A Improper surface integrals.
D Since we are only dealing with areas, the integrand is automatically positive. Truncate suitably
before the computation of the surface integral, and then take the limit.
I 1) The curve K of the equation
y2(a −x) = x3

The length of the circle Cx (around the line x = a) at the height y(x) is 2π(a −x), [In fact,
0 ≤x < a].
If we truncate at the height y(x0) corresponding to some x0 ∈[0, a[, and remember the sym-
metry around y = 0 we get the corresponding surface area,

The improper surface area exists and its value is

Example 30.10 A surface F is given by the equation
z = 1 + x2 −y2,

1. Indicate the type of the surface and its vertices.

I 1) It follows from the rearrangement

that the surface is an equilateral hyperbolic paraboloid with its vertex at (0, 0, 1).

The normal vector is in this point
(−2x, 2y, 1) = (−4, 2, 1) = N,
and an equation of the tangent plane is
0

N · (x −2, y −1, z −4) = (−4, 2, 1) · (x −2, y −1, z −4)
=
−4x + 2y + z + 8 −2 −4 = −4x + 2y + z + 2,
hence by a rearrangement,
z = 4x −2y −2.
3) The parametric domain for F(q) is the disc in the (x, y)-plane
D(q) = {(x, y) | x2 + y2 ≤q2}.
Since z = 1 + x2 −y2 on F(q), it follows by the theorem of reduction that

Formulæ
Some of the following formulæ can be assumed to be known from high school. It is highly recommended
that one learns most of these formulæ in this appendix by heart.
31.1
Squares etc.
The following simple formulæ occur very frequently in the most diﬀerent situations.
(a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab,
a2 + b2 + 2ab = (a + b)2,
(a −b)2 = a2 + b2 −2ab,
a2 + b2 −2ab = (a −b)2,
(a + b)(a −b) = a2 −b2,
a2 −b2 = (a + b)(a −b),
(a + b)2 = (a −b)2 + 4ab,
(a −b)2 = (a + b)2 −4ab.
31.2

Remark 31.1 It happens quite frequently that students make errors when they try to apply these
rules. They must be mastered! In particular, as one of my friends once put it: “If you can master the
square root, you can master everything in mathematics!” Notice that this innocent looking square
root is one of the most diﬃcult operations in Calculus. Do not forget the absolute value! ♦

Diﬀerentiation
Here are given the well-known rules of diﬀerentiation together with some rearrangements which some-
times may be easier to use:
{f(x) ± g(x)}′ = f ′(x) ± g′(x),
{f(x)g(x)}′ = f ′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x) = f(x)g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the latter rearrangement presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0.
If g(x) = 0, we get the usual formula known from high school
f(x)
g(x)
′
= f ′(x)g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
.
It is often more convenient to compute this expression in the following way:
f(x)
g(x)

= d
dx

f(x) ·
1
g(x)

= f ′(x)
g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
= f(x)
g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the former expression often is much easier to use in practice than the usual formula from high
school, and where the latter expression again presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0. Under these
assumptions we see that the formulæ above can be written
{f(x)g(x)}′
f(x)g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x) ,
{f(x)/g(x)}′
f(x)/g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x) .
Since
d
dx ln |f(x)| = f ′(x)
f(x) ,
f(x) = 0,
we also name these the logarithmic derivatives.
Finally, we mention the rule of diﬀerentiation of a composite function
{f(ϕ(x))}′ = f ′(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x).
We ﬁrst diﬀerentiate the function itself; then the insides. This rule is a 1-dimensional version of the
so-called Chain rule.

Integration
The most obvious rules are dealing with linearity

{f(x) + λg(x)} dx =

f(x) dx + λ

g(x) dx,
where λ ∈R is a constant,
and with the fact that diﬀerentiation and integration are “inverses to each other”, i.e. modulo some
arbitrary constant c ∈R, which often tacitly is missing,

f ′(x) dx = f(x).
If we in the latter formula replace f(x) by the product f(x)g(x), we get by reading from the right to
the left and then diﬀerentiating the product,
f(x)g(x) =

{f(x)g(x)}′ dx =

f ′(x)g(x) dx +

f(x)g′(x) dx.
Hence, by a rearrangement
The rule of partial integration:

f ′(x)g(x) dx = f(x)g(x) −

f(x)g′(x) dx.
The diﬀerentiation is moved from one factor of the integrand to the other one by changing the sign
and adding the term f(x)g(x).
Remark 31.3 This technique was earlier used a lot, but is almost forgotten these days. It must
be revived, because MAPLE and pocket calculators apparently do not know it.
It is possible to
construct examples where these devices cannot give the exact solution, unless you ﬁrst perform a
partial integration yourself. ♦
Remark 31.4 This method can also be used when we estimate integrals which cannot be directly
calculated, because the antiderivative is not contained in e.g. the catalogue of MAPLE. The idea is
by a succession of partial integrations to make the new integrand smaller. ♦
Integration by substitution:
If the integrand has the special structure f(ϕ(x))·ϕ′(x), then one can change the variable to y = ϕ(x):

f(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x) dx = “

f(ϕ(x)) dϕ(x)′′ =

y=ϕ(x)
f(y) dy.

Integration by a monotonous substitution:
If ϕ(y) is a monotonous function, which maps the y-interval one-to-one onto the x-interval, then

f(x) dx =

y=ϕ−1(x)
f(ϕ(y))ϕ′(y) dy.
Remark 31.5 This rule is usually used when we have some “ugly” term in the integrand f(x). The
idea is to put this ugly term equal to y = ϕ−1(x). When e.g. x occurs in f(x) in the form √x, we put
y = ϕ−1(x) = √x, hence x = ϕ(y) = y2 and ϕ′(y) = 2y. ♦

Trigonometric formulæ
The trigonometric formulæ are closely connected with circular movements. Thus (cos u, sin u) are
the coordinates of a point P on the unit circle corresponding to the angle u, cf. ﬁgure A.1. This
geometrical interpretation is used from time to time.

Figure 31.1: The unit circle and the trigonometric functions.
The fundamental trigonometric relation:
cos2 u + sin2 u = 1,
for u ∈R.
Using the previous geometric interpretation this means according to Pythagoras’s theorem, that the
point P with the coordinates (cos u, sin u) always has distance 1 from the origo (0, 0), i.e. it is lying
on the boundary of the circle of centre (0, 0) and radius
√
1 = 1.
Connection to the complex exponential function:
The complex exponential is for imaginary arguments deﬁned by
exp(i u) := cos u + i sin u.
It can be checked that the usual functional equation for exp is still valid for complex arguments. In
other word: The deﬁnition above is extremely conveniently chosen.
By using the deﬁnition for exp(i u) and exp(−i u) it is easily seen that
cos u = 1
2(exp(i u) + exp(−i u)),
sin u = 1
2i(exp(i u) −exp(−i u)),

Formulæ
Moivre’s formula: We get by expressing exp(inu) in two diﬀerent ways:
exp(inu) = cos nu + i sin nu = (cos u + i sin u)n.
Example 31.1 If we e.g. put n = 3 into Moivre’s formula, we obtain the following typical application,
cos(3u) + i sin(3u) = (cos u + i sin u)3
= cos3 u + 3i cos2 u · sin u + 3i2 cosu · sin2 u + i3 sin3 u
= {cos3 u −3 cosu · sin2 u} + i{3 cos2 u · sin u −sin3 u}
= {4 cos3 u −3 cosu} + i{3 sinu −4 sin3 u}
When this is split into the real- and imaginary parts we obtain
cos 3u = 4 cos3 u −3 cosu,
sin 3u = 3 sin u −4 sin3 u.
♦
Addition formulæ:
sin(u + v) = sin u cos v + cos u sin v,
sin(u −v) = sin u cos v −cos u sin v,
cos(u + v) = cos u cos v −sin u sin v,
cos(u −v) = cos u cos v + sin u sin v.

Hyperbolic formulæ
These are very much like the trigonometric formulæ, and if one knows a little of Complex Function
Theory it is realized that they are actually identical. The structure of this section is therefore the same
as for the trigonometric formulæ. The reader should compare the two sections concerning similarities
and diﬀerences.
The fundamental relation:
cosh2 x −sinh2 x = 1.
Deﬁnitions:
cosh x = 1
2 (exp(x) + exp(−x)) ,
sinh x = 1
2 (exp(x) −exp(−x)) .
“Moivre’s formula”:
exp(x) = cosh x + sinh x.
This is trivial and only rarely used. It has been included to show the analogy.
Addition formulæ:
sinh(x + y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) + cosh(x) sinh(y),
sinh(x −y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) −cosh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x + y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) + sinh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x −y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) −sinh(x) sinh(y).
Formulæ of halving and doubling the argument:
sinh(2x) = 2 sinh(x) cosh(x),
cosh(2x) = cosh2(x) + sinh2(x) = 2 cosh2(x) −1 = 2 sinh2(x) + 1,

Magnitudes of functions
We often have to compare functions for x →0+, or for x →∞. The simplest type of functions are
therefore arranged in an hierarchy:
1) logarithms,
2) power functions,
3) exponential functions,
4) faculty functions.
When x →∞, a function from a higher class will always dominate a function form a lower class. More
precisely:
A) A power function dominates a logarithm for x →∞:
(ln x)β
xα
→0
for x →∞,
α, β > 0.
B) An exponential dominates a power function for x →∞:
xα
ax →0
for x →∞,
α, a > 1.
C) The faculty function dominates an exponential for n →∞:
an
n! →0,
n →∞,
n ∈N,
a > 0.
D) When x →0+ we also have that a power function dominates the logarithm:
xα ln x →0−,
for x →0+,
α > 0.
