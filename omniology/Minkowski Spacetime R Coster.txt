Introduction
This document describes the reformulation of the Lorantz Transformation as
given by Minkowski. This new formulation gave rise to the concept of spacetime
as we know today.

Rotation
First we consider the situation when a co-ordinate systems becomes rotated
with respect to another co-ordinate system.
Figure 1: Rotated co-ordinate system
As can be seen in ﬁgure (1) the K co-ordinate system has rotated with respect
to the K′ system along the x-axis. The following relationship can easily be
deduced:


x′
y′
z′


=


1
0
0
0
cos θ
−sin θ
0
sin θ
cos θ




x
y
z


(1)
This is called a co-ordinate transformation.

Lorentz Transformation
Given two co-ordinate systems as shown in ﬁgure (2).
Figure 2: Moving co-ordinate systems
The K′ system moves with velocity v along the z-axis. According to Einstein
the co-ordinate tranformation between the two systems is given by the Lorentz
Transformation (LT):
x′
=
x

y′
=
y

z′
=
z −vt

t′
=

Minkowski’s formulation
For now lets focus on the z and t co-ordinates. Then the following relationship
occurs:
 z′
t′

=

1/γ
−βc/γ
−β/γc
1/γ
  z′
t′


using
β
=
v
c
(7)
γ
=
r
1 −v2

Substituting the relations
x3
=
z
(9)
x4
=
ict
(10)
gives
 x′

x′
4

=

1/γ
iβ/γ
−iβ/γ
1/γ
  x3
x4

(11)
Now introduce
cosh θ
=
1
γ
(12)
Using the relation cosh2 x −sinh2 x = 1, it can be decduced that
sinh θ
=
β
γ
(13)
tanh θ
=
β
(14)
Finally, substituting this results in

x′
3
x′
4

=

cosh θ
i sinh θ
−i sinh θ
cosh θ
 
x3
x4

(15)
=

cos iθ
sin iθ
−sin iθ
cos iθ
 
x3
x4

(16)
Using the relations cos iθ = cosh θ and sin iθ = i sinh θ.
The total transformation matrix thus is




x′
1
x′
2
x′
3
x′
4




=




1

cos iθ
sin iθ

−sin iθ
cos iθ








x1
x2

x4




(17)
=
M




x1




(18)
Now compare this with the rotation formula (1) and notice the similarity.
The Lorentz Transformation appears to be merely a rotation in the complex
co-ordinate system (x1, x2, x3, x4) along the complex angle iθ. A remarkable
observation! Formulated in this way the time co-ordinate x4 acts as just an-
other space co-ordinate. This initiated the idea that space and time are even
more intermixed than the Lorentz Transformation in its original formulation
already suggested. The complex co-ordinate system (x1, x2, x3, x4) is what is
called Minkowski spacetime, or simply spacetime.
