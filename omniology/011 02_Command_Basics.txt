Command
Basics

Open 
Terminal!
Step 1:

When we open up our terminal, we'll see our prompt
which will likely include your username@machinename,
followed by a ~ and then a dollar sign.  We'll learn how
to change the prompt later on.
This prompt is what we'll see whenever the shell is
ready to accept new input.  All we need to do is type
some commands and hit enter.
If we try typing some gibberish and hit enter, the shell
attempts to find a command with that name before
telling us "command not found".
The Prompt
colt@linux~$
jakshdbd
❯
command not found

The date command may not be the most useful
command of all time, but it's a great place to
start.  
Try typing date and then hit enter.  You should
see the current date printed out!
Our First
Command!

Commands are case sensitive, so Date is NOT
the same thing as date.   
* If you're using OS X, some commands are not
case sensitive, but others are. It's safest to
assume all commands are case sensitive.
Case Matters!

Try typing ncal into your prompt.  Hit enter and
you should see the current month's calendar
printed out.     
ncal stands for "new cal".  There is also a "cal"
command that does the same exact thing, but
ncal adds some fancier functionality.

In the terminal, we can use the left and
right arrow keys to move through a line of
text, one character at a time.
Use the up arrow to access previously
entered commands, which can save you
tons on typing!
Use The 
Arrow Keys

Most commands support multiple options that modify their behavior.  We
can decide which options to include, if any, when we execute a command.
Similarly, many commands accept arguments (the things that the command
acts upon or uses)
Command Structure
command -options arguments
❯

The terms "argument" and "parameter" are often used
interchangeably to refer to values that we provide to
commands. 
The echo command is extremely simple.   It takes the
arguments we provide to it and prints them out.  It echoes
them back at us.
Arguments
echo mwahahaha
❯
mwahahaha

The ncal command accepts values to
control the specific month(s) and year it
displays.
If we specify only a year, ncal will print
out the calendar for that entire year.
If we specify a month and a year, ncal
will print only that month's calendar.
Arguments
ncal 1999
❯
ncal 2021
❯
ncal july 1969
❯

The sort command, which we will cover in
depth later, accepts a filename.  It prints
out the sorted contents of that file.
For example, sort colors.txt prints out
each line of the colors.txt file, sorted in
alphabetical order.  
Arguments
sort colors.txt
❯
blue
green
indigo
orange
red
violet

The specifics don't matter.  
Focus on the PATTERN.

Each command typically supports a host of
options that we can choose to use when
executing the command.    These options
modify the behavior of the command in
predefined ways.
Options are prefixed by a dash, as in -h or -3. 
Options
command -option
❯
ncal -j
❯
sort -r colors.txt
❯

Please do not worry
about remembering
any of these options
I'm about to show you.

We can provide the -h option to turn off
the highlighting of today's date.
Options
By default, the ncal command
highlights today's date in the output.

Combining Options
We can provide multiple options at once. This example uses the -3
option to display the previous, current, and next month AND the -h
option to turn off the highlighting of the current date.

Another Syntax
When we provide multiple options to a single command, we can use a
shorter syntax where we only need a single dash (-) character
ncal -3h

Tu     7 14 21 28        5 12 19 26     2  9 16 23 30

Sa  4 11 18 25        2  9 16 23 30     6 13 20 27      

All these short one-character options can get
confusing! Some options also support equivalent long
format options that are usually full words and are
prefixed with two dashes instead of just one.
For example, the date -u option is used to print the
date in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  We can
instead use date --universal to accomplish the same
end result.
Long Form Options
date -u 
❯
date --universal 
❯

Here's another example using the sort command (which
we have not really covered yet)
The sort -r option will sort a files contents in reverse.  If
we prefer, we can use the longer form sort --reverse to
accomplish the same thing.
Long Form Options
sort -r colors.txt
❯
sort --reverse colors.txt
❯

To use multiple long-form options in a single command,
we must write them out separately with their own
dashes (--).  We cannot combine long-form options in
the same way we can with single character options.
Multiple Long 
Form Options
sort --reverse --unique colors.txt
❯
sort -ru colors.txt
❯

Options With Parameters
Some options require us to pass in an additional value.  For example,
ncal's -A option is used to display a certain number of months AFTER a
specific date.  We need to tell it how many months to display.
ncal -A 1

prints out the current
month (october) with
one month afterwards
(november)
Note: this can also be
written as ncal -A1 (no
space between A and 1)

Options With Parameters
There is also a -B option to print a number of months BEFORE the
specific date.  We need to pass it a number of months.
