Photoshop Elements 5 For Dummies 

Introduction
W
hat was once a consumer-grade, low-level program for beginning image
editors and a junior cousin to the powerful Adobe Photoshop program
has evolved and matured to stand on its own merits now in version 5.0 for
Windows. As of this writing, Elements is available on the Mac in version 4.
You won’t find much comparison between Adobe Photoshop Elements and
Adobe Photoshop in this book, nor will you see any suggestions that you
should consider using Photoshop for one thing or another. We don’t make
suggestions, simply because Photoshop Elements is a powerful tool that sat-
isfies many needs of amateurs and professionals alike.
Who should buy Elements (and, ultimately, this book)? The range of people
who can benefit from using Elements is wide and includes a vast audience.
From beginning image editors to intermediate users to more advanced amateurs
and professionals, Elements has something for everyone. We’ll even stick our
necks out a little and suggest that many Photoshop users can benefit greatly
by adding Elements to their software tool cabinets. Why? Because Elements
offers some wonderful creation tools that Photoshop hasn’t yet dreamed of
supporting. For example, in Photoshop Elements 5 on Windows, you can
create post cards, greeting cards, calendars, and photo albums with just a
few mouse clicks. You can place orders with online service centers that pro-
fessionally print your photo creations. All these opportunities are available in
Elements, and we cover these and many more creation ideas in Chapters 15
and 16.
The downside to the Photoshop Elements program is that version 5 is sup-
ported only in Windows. Adobe was a little late in releasing a Macintosh 
version, which now is released only in version 4. Whether we see version 5
for the Mac is yet to be seen. You may find version 5 released by Adobe after
this book has been published. However, all the references to the Organizer
in this book apply only to Windows. Adobe left the file management options
to iPhoto in the Mac version, and you can expect a Photoshop Elements 5
version for the Mac to continue with iPhoto file handling. In the meantime,
we did our best to write this book with a cross-platform audience in mind.
To set your frame of mind to thinking in Photoshop Elements terms, don’t think
of the program as a scaled-down version of Adobe Photoshop. Those days are
gone. If you’re a digital photographer and you shoot your pictures in JPEG or
Camera Raw format, Elements has the tools for you to open, edit, and massage
your pictures into professional images. If you worry about color profile

Photoshop Elements 5 For Dummies 
embedding, forget it. Elements can handle the task for you, as we explain in
Chapter 4, where we talk about Camera Raw, and in Chapter 14, where we talk
about color profiling and printing. For the professional, Photoshop Elements
has just about everything you need to create final images for color printing
and commercial printing.
If you’re a beginner or an intermediate user, you’ll find some of the Photoshop
Elements quick-fix operations a breeze to use to help you enhance your images,
as we explain in Chapters 9 and 10. And, when it comes time for you to print
some homemade greeting cards, calendars, and photo albums — whether
you’re a beginner, an intermediate user, or a professional user — Elements
provides you with easy-to-follow steps to package your creations, as we
cover in Chapters 15 and 16.
About This Book
This book is an effort to provide, in about 400 pages, as much of a compre-
hensive view of a wildly feature-rich program as we can. There’s a lot to
Elements, and we try to offer you as much as possible within our limited
amount of space. We begged for more pages, but alas, our publisher wants
to get this book in your hands in full color and with an attractive price tag.
Therefore, even though we may skip over a few little things, all you need to
know about using Photoshop Elements for designing images for print, shar-
ing, Web hosting, versatile packaging, e-mailing, and more is covered in the
pages ahead.
As we said, Photoshop Elements has something for just about everyone.
Hence, we know that our audience is large and that not everyone will use
every tool, command, or method described in this book. Therefore, we added
a lot of cross-references in the text, in case you want to jump around. You can
go to just about any chapter and start reading; and, if some concept needs
more explanation, we point you in the right direction for getting some back-
ground when it’s necessary.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we point you to menus where commands are accessed
frequently. A couple of things to remember are the references for where to go
when we detail steps in a procedure. For accessing a menu command, you
may see a sentence like this one:
Choose File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.

When you see commands like this one mentioned, we’re asking you to click
the File menu to open the drop-down menu, click the menu command labeled
Get Photos, and then choose the command From Files and Folders from the
submenu that appears.
Another convention we use refers to context menus. A context menu jumps
up at your cursor position and shows you a menu similar to the menu you
select at the top of the Elements workspace. To open a context menu, click
the right mouse button. On the Mac, press the Control key and click the
mouse to open a context menu.
A third item relates to using keystrokes on your keyboard. When we mention
that some keys need to be pressed on your keyboard, the text is described
like this:
Press Alt+Shift+Ctrl+S (Option+Shift+Ô+S on the Mac).
In this case, you hold down the Alt key on Windows (or the Option key on
the Mac), the Shift key, and the Control key in Windows (or the Ô key on the
Mac) and then press the S key. Then release all the keys at the same time.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into logical parts where related features are nested
together in chapters within six different parts of the book:
Part I: Getting Started
If you just bought a digital camera and you’re new to image editing in a pro-
gram like Photoshop Elements, you’re probably tempted to jump into fixing
and editing your pictures. The essentials usually aren’t the most exciting
part of any program or book. That’s true with this book, too: The more mun-
dane issues related to understanding some basics are assembled in the first
three chapters. Although some bits of information aren’t as exciting as in
many other chapters, you must understand them before you start editing
images. Be sure to review the first three chapters before you dive into the
other chapters.
In Part I, we talk about the tools, menus, commands, preferences, work-
spaces, and features that help you move around easily in the program.
The more you pick up in the preliminary chapters, the more easily you can
adapt to the Elements way of working.

Photoshop Elements 5 For Dummies 
Part II: Getting Organized
In Part II, we talk about getting photos in Elements, organizing your files,
searching for files, and grouping your photos, and we give you much more
information related to the Photoshop Elements Organizer. The Organizer is
your central workplace, and knowing a great deal about using the Organizer
window helps you move around much faster in the program.
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos
Part III relates to creating and manipulating selections. There’s a lot to making
selections in photos, but after you figure it out (by reading Chapter 7), you
can cut out a figure in a picture and drop it into another picture, drop differ-
ent backgrounds into pictures, or isolate an area that needs some brightness
and contrast adjustment. In Chapter 8, we talk about layers and how to create
and manage them in Elements. In many other chapters, we refer you to
Chapter 8 because you need to work with layers for many other tasks you do
in Elements.
In Chapter 9, we talk about fixing image flaws and problems. That picture you
took with your digital camera may be underexposed or overexposed, or it
may need some work to remove dust and scratches. Maybe it needs a little
sharpening, or some other imperfection requires editing. All the know-hows
and how-tos are in this chapter.
In Chapter 10, we cover how to correct color problems, brightness, and con-
trast. We show you ways to quickly fix photos as well as some methods for
custom image corrections.
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist
This part is designed to bring out the artist in you. Considering the easy appli-
cation of Elements filter effects, you can turn a photo image into a drawing or
apply a huge number of different effects to change the look of your image.
In Chapter 12, we talk about drawing and painting so that you can let your
artistic expression run wild. We follow up in Chapter 13 by talking about
adding text to photos so that you can create your own layouts, posters,
cards, and more.
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing
One critical chapter in this book is Chapter 14, where we talk about printing
your pictures. If your prints don’t look the way they do on your monitor, you
need to read and reread this chapter.

If screen viewing is of interest to you, we cover in Chapter 15 a number of 
different options for viewing your pictures on-screen. For slide shows, 
Web-hosted images, animated images, photo viewing on your TV, and even
creating movie files, this chapter shows you the many ways you can view
your Elements images on-screen.
We wrap up this part with Chapter 16, in which we describe how to make cre-
ations and share files. You have a number of different options for making 
creations to share or print.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
We wrap up this book with the Part of Tens chapters. We offer ten tips for
composing better images and give you ten more project ideas to try with
Elements.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins throughout this book, you’ll see icons indicating that some-
thing important is stated in the respective text.
This icon informs you that the item discussed is a new feature in Photoshop
Elements 5.
A tip tells you about an alternative method for a procedure, by giving you a
shortcut, a workaround, or some other type of helpful information related to
working on tasks in the section being discussed.
Pay particular attention when you see the Warning icon. This information
informs you when you may experience a problem performing your work in
Elements.
This icon is a heads-up for something you may want to commit to memory.
Usually, it tells you about a shortcut for a repetitive task, where remembering
a procedure can save you time.
Elements is a computer program, after all. No matter how hard we try to 
simplify our explanation of features, we can’t entirely avoid the technical
information. If we think that a topic is complex, we use this icon to alert you
that we’re moving into a complex subject. You won’t see many of these icons
in the book because we try our best to bring the details to nontechnical terms.

Where to Go from Here
As we say earlier in the Introduction, the first part of this book serves as a
foundation for all the other chapters. Try to spend a little time reading
through the three chapters in Part I. After that, feel free to jump around and
pay special attention to the cross-referenced chapters, in case you get stuck
on a concept.
When you need a little extra help, refer to Chapter 1, where we talk about
using the online help documents available in Elements.
If you have some questions, comments, suggestions, or complaints, go to

We wish you much success and enjoyment in using Adobe Photoshop
Elements 5, and it is our sincere wish that the pages ahead provide you
with an informative and helpful view of the program.

Part I
Getting Started

In this part . . .
H
ere you have it: a computer book speciﬁcally
designed to help you get the most out of a
computer software program — and not just any
software program, but a powerful one with many
complicated features. You probably want to jump
in and perform some spiffy editing operations to
get that prize photo looking the best you can.
Inasmuch as we try to accommodate you in set-
ting forth a how-to book in a nonlinear fashion,
where you can freely move around and read about
the techniques you want to use without having to
read each chapter in linear order, you have to
understand a few basics for editing your photos.
In this ﬁrst part of the book, we talk about some
essentials to help you fully understand all the
parts ahead. We ﬁrst talk about your Photoshop
Elements working environment and describe the
many tools and features you can use for all your
Elements sessions. We also cover the very impor-
tant task of getting color set for optimum viewing
on your computer monitor and describe some
essentials you need to know about color as it
relates to photo images. Part I contains some
important information that you should plan to
carefully review and understand before going 
too far into all the Elements features. Don’t pass
up this part. Turn the page and start getting
acquainted with the Adobe Photoshop Elements
basics.

Getting to Know the Work Area
In This Chapter
 Understanding the Elements workspace
 Changing workspace views
 Working with the Photo Bin
 Using the Undo History palette
 Accessing Help documents
 Using keyboard shortcuts
I
n the Elements work areas, you find quite a collection of tools, palettes,
buttons, and options. Just a quick glance at the Elements workspace when
you enter Full Edit mode shows you some of the power that Elements offers
with just a click of your mouse. With all the possibilities, the Elements work-
space can be intimidating. To ease your introduction to the many
options for editing your pictures, we break them down for you
in this chapter.
Elements has several work areas, and we start off by
introducing you to the one you’ll likely use most
often, Full Edit mode. In this mode, you can be 
creative with all the tools and features Photoshop
Elements is known for, such as filters, drawing tools,
layers, and more. We then introduce other work
areas and tools you may not be as familiar with —
Quick Fix mode for making common corrections to
photos, Creation Setup mode for collecting your photos
into creations such as calendars, and the Photo Bin for
navigating among all your open images.
Before you start working in Elements, you’ll find it helpful to
know how to undo edits so that you can start over easily and find addi-
tional sources of help within Elements. We also explain one of the handiest
ways to select tools and enter common commands: keyboard shortcuts.

10
Part I: Getting Started 
Elements 5 also has the Organizer, a powerful tool for acquiring your images
and keeping them organized. The Organizer includes features that help you
view and search for images, too. We introduce the Organizer in Part II.
Getting Around in Full Edit Mode
Full Edit mode offers bundles of tools for editing your images, from correc-
tion tools for fixing color and clarity to filters, layers, and more for creating
entirely original images either from existing photos or from scratch. But all
these tools also make Full Edit mode complex.
Figure 1-1 shows Elements in Full Edit mode, highlighting all the tools and fea-
tures we discuss in this section.
Jumping to Full Edit mode
You can move into Full Edit mode in a couple of ways:
 From the initial Welcome screen, click Edit and Enhance Photos and
open a photo. Your Elements window appears in Full Edit mode, as
shown in Figure 1-1.
 From the Organizer, click Edit on the Shortcuts bar and choose Go to
Full Edit from the drop-down menu.
Examining the Image window
Not surprisingly, the Image window’s tools and features are most useful when
an image is open in the window. To get an image into the image window (refer
to Figure 1-1), follow these steps:
1. Click the Open tool on the Shortcuts bar.
The standard Open dialog box appears. It works like any ordinary Open
dialog box you find in other applications.
2. Move around your hard drive by using methods you know to open
folders and select a picture.
If you haven’t yet downloaded digital camera images or acquired scanned
photos and want an image to experiment with, you can use an image
found in your My Pictures folder that was installed with Windows or
select a photo on the Mac.
3. After selecting a picture, click Open.
The photo opens in a new image window in Elements.

Figure 1-1: The Photoshop Elements workspace is shown when you open a file in Full Edit mode.
You can open as many image windows in Elements as your computer
memory can handle. As each new file is opened, a thumbnail image is added
to the Photo Bin at the bottom of the screen (see Figure 1-1), and the image
windows are stacked, with the current active image in the topmost window.
To bring another open file to the foreground and make it active, click the
respective thumbnail in the Photo Bin.

Part I: Getting Started 
Here’s a quick look at important
items in the image window, shown
in Figure 1-2:
 Scroll bars become active
when you zoom in on an image.
You can click the scroll arrows,
move the Scroll bar, or grab the
Hand tool in the Tools palette
and drag within the window to
move the image around.
 The Magnification box shows
you at a glance how much you
zoom in or out.
 The Information box shows you
a readout for a particular tidbit
of information. You can choose
what information you want to
see in this area by choosing one
of the options from the pop-up
menu, which we discuss in
more detail later in this section.
When you’re working on an image in
Elements, you always want to know the physi-
cal image size, the image resolution, and the
color mode. (These terms are explained in
more detail in Chapters 3 and 4.) Regardless
of which menu option you choose from the
status bar, you can get a quick glimpse at
these essential stats by clicking the
Information box, which displays a pop-up
menu like the one shown in Figure 1-3.
 The Size box enables you to resize the window. Move the cursor to the
box, and a diagonal line with two opposing arrows appears. When the
cursor changes, drag in or out to size the window smaller or larger.
You can also resize the window by dragging any of the other corners in
or out.
 Click the Minimize button (the _ button in the upper-right corner of the
image window), and the window hides from view. It’s still open; you just
click the image in the Photo Bin to maximize the window. On the Mac,
it’s the yellow minus (–) button in the top-left corner.
 If you click the Maximize button (the button with the box-shaped icon),
the Title bar shown at the top of the window disappears and provides
you with a little more room for viewing images in the window. On the
Mac, it’s the green plus sign (+) in the top-left corner.

Figure 1-3: Click the readout on
the status bar, and a pop-up
menu shows you important
information about your file.

 You can click the Close button (it’s shaped like an X) to close the active
image window and keep Elements open. Alternatively, you can use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+W/Ô+W or the menu command File➪Close to
close the active window. On the Mac, it’s the red button in the top-left
corner.
Now that you’re familiar with the
overall image window, we want to
introduce you to the Information
box’s pop-up menu, which enables
you to choose the type of informa-
tion you want to view in the
Information box. Click the right-
pointing arrow to open the menu, as
shown in Figure 1-4.
Here’s the lowdown on the options
you find on the pop-up menu:
 Document Sizes: Shows you the
saved file size.
 Document Profile: Shows
you the color profile used with
the file.
 Document Dimensions: Shows
you the physical size in your default unit of measure, such as inches.
 Scratch Sizes: As shown in Figure 1-4, displays the amount of memory 
on your hard drive that’s consumed by all documents open in Elements.
For example, 20M/200M indicates that the open documents consume
20 megabytes and that a total of 200 megabytes are available for Elements
to edit your images. As you add more content to a file, such as new layers,
the first figure grows while the second figure remains static.
 Efficiency: Indicates how many operations you’re performing in RAM as
opposed to using your scratch disk. When the number is 100%, you’re
working in RAM. When the number drops below 100%, you’re using the
scratch disk. If you continually work below 100%, it’s a good indication
that you need to buy more RAM to increase your efficiency.
 Timing: Indicates the time it took to complete the last operation.
 Current Tool: Shows the name of the tool selected from the Tools
palette.
Don’t worry about trying to understand all these terms. The important thing
to know is that you can visit the pop-up menu and change the items at will
during your editing sessions.

Part I: Getting Started 
Moving through the menu bar
Like just about every program you launch in Windows or on the Mac, Elements
supports drop-down menus. The menus are logically constructed and identi-
fied to provide commands for working with your pictures (commands that
you don’t find supported in tools and on palettes). A quick glimpse at the
menu names gives you a hint of what might be contained in a given menu list.
The ten different menus are described in this list:
 File menu: Just as you might suspect, the File menu contains commands
for working with your picture as a file. You find commands in the menu
list for saving, opening, processing, importing, exporting, and printing.
We cover saving files in Chapter 3 and printing or exporting for other
output in Part V.
 Edit menu: As you might guess, the old-fashioned Copy, Cut, and Paste
commands are located here. Additionally, you have some important file
settings commands on the menu, including preferences, which we cover
in more detail in Chapter 2.
 Image menu: You find yourself using the Image menu when you want to
effect changes to the entire image, such as changing a color mode or
cropping, rotating, and resizing the image. For details about sizing and
color modes, check out Chapter 3. For more about cropping and rotating
images, flip to Chapter 9.
 Enhance menu: Just the name of this menu should tell you what com-
mands to expect here. This is where you go to change the appearance of
an image, such as changing its brightness and contrast, adjusting its
color and lighting, and doing some other smart fix-up work to improve
its appearance. On the Enhance➪Adjust Color submenu, you find a
new adjustment introduced in Elements 5: Color Curves. Look to
Chapter 10 for some detail on using this new command. In Chapters 9
and 10, you find out how to use correction tools so that your images
look their best.
 Layer menu: As we describe in great detail in Chapter 8 (a whole chap-
ter just about layers), most kinds of editing you do in Elements are best
handled by using layers. Elements neatly tucks away all the relevant
commands associated with working in layers right here.
 Select menu: Of just about equal importance to layers are selections.
Whereas the Image menu contains commands that are applied to the
entire image, you can edit isolated areas of an image by using the com-
mands on the Select menu. To isolate an area, you need to create a 
selection, as we explain in Chapter 7. This menu contains commands to
help you with all the essential tasks related to working with selections.

 Filter menu: The Filter menu is where you leave the world of photogra-
phy and explore the world of a fine artist. With tons of different filter
commands, you can create some extraordinary effects. Find out all
about filters in Chapter 11.
 View menu: Zooming in and out of images, turning on a grid, exposing
horizontal and vertical rulers, adding annotations, and checking out the
print size of your pictures are handled on the View menu. Chapter 5
unearths secrets of the Zoom tool, rulers, and more.
 Window menu: Elements supports a number of different palettes, as we
explain later in this chapter. Elements has so many palettes that keeping
them all open at one time is impractical. Thanks to the Window menu, you
can easily view and hide palettes, reopen the Welcome window, tile and
cascade open windows, and bring inactive windows to the foreground.
 Help menu: We hope that you get all the help you need right here in this
book; but just in case we miss something (or your neighbor has bor-
rowed it, fine book that it is), you have some interactive help, right at
your mouse-tip, on the Help menu. The menu also offers links to the
Adobe Web site for more information and a little assistance, courtesy of
the tutorials accessible from this menu. (Find a little more detail about
accessing help later in this chapter.)
Uncovering the context menus
Context menus are common to many programs, and Photoshop Elements is no
exception. They’re those little menus that appear when you right-click, offer-
ing commands and tools related to whatever area or tool you right-clicked.
The context menus are your solution when you may be in doubt about 
where to find a command on a menu. You just right-click an item, and a 
pop-up menu opens. As you become familiar with 
Photoshop Elements and struggle to find a menu 
command, always try to first open a context 
menu and look for the command you want in the 
menu list.
Because context menus provide commands 
respective to the tool you’re using, the menu 
commands change according to what tool or 
feature you’re using at the moment you open a 
context menu. For example, in Figure 1-5, you can 
see the context menu that appears after we cre-
ate a selection marquee and right-click that 
marquee in the Image window. Notice that the 
commands are all related to selections.

Part I: Getting Started 
Using the Tools palette
Elements provides a good number of palettes for
different purposes. The one that you’ll find you
use most is the Tools palette. In palette hierarchy
terms, you typically first click a tool in the Tools
palette and then use another palette for additional
tool options or use the Options bar for fine-tuning
your tool instruments. More often than not, click-
ing a tool in the Tools palette is your first step in
most editing sessions.
Tools can be easily accessed in Elements by press-
ing shortcut keys on your keyboard. For a quick
glance at the Tools palette and the keystrokes
needed to access the tools, look over Figure 1-6.
If you accidentally press the Tab key on your key-
board, the Tools palette hides from view. Press
Tab again and the Tools palette reappears.
Notice in the Tools palette that several tools
appear with a tiny arrow pointing right and down-
ward in the lower-right corner of each tool. When-
ever you see this arrowhead, remember that more
tools are nested within that tool group. Click a tool
with an arrowhead and hold down the mouse
button. A pop-up toolbar opens, as shown in
Figure 1-7, and offers you more tool selections
within that group.
To select tools within a tool group by using key-
strokes, press the Shift key and strike the respective
key (shown in Figure 1-6) to access the tool. Keep
the Shift key down and repeatedly press the short-
cut key to scroll through all tools in a given group.
The shortcuts work for you at all times except
when you’re typing text. Be certain to click the
Tools palette to select a tool if your 
last edit was made with one of the 
Type tools.
The tools are varied, and you may 
find that you don’t use all the tools
in the Tools palette in your work-
flow. Rather than describe the tool

functions here, we address the tools in the remaining chapters in this book as
they pertain to the respective Elements tasks.
Playing with palettes
Elements provides you with a bunch of palettes that contain settings and
options used to refine the tools you select in the Tools palette and tasks you
perform to edit images. Assume for a moment that you want to let your cre-
ative juices loose and create a Picasso-esque painting — something that you
can easily do in Photoshop Elements.
You first click the Brush tool and then click a color in the Color Swatches
palette. On a new canvas, you begin to paint. When you want to change color,
you click again in the Color Swatches palette on a different color. This kind of
interactivity between the Tools palette and another palette is something you
frequently use in Elements.
Palettes are accessed from either the Palette Bin or the Window menu.
Many options in palettes are intuitive. To become familiar with various
palette options, just poke around a little, and most of the options will
become familiar to you.
Selecting tool options from the Options bar
When you click a tool in the Tools palette, the Options bar offers you choices
specific to a selected tool. Figure 1-8 shows the options available when the
Clone Stamp tool is selected.
Figure 1-8: The Options bar provides attribute choices for a tool selected in the Tools palette.
Juggling all your interface options
With all the settings you can use for any given tool, trying to figure out
exactly where to select an option for the edit you want to make can become
downright frustrating. To help simplify the process of using tools and select-
ing options for the tools, here’s what you might do in your normal workflow:
1. Select a tool in the Tools palette.
Obviously, you need to know what task you want to perform, so select-
ing the proper tool to complete the task is important to know upfront.
2. Take a quick look at the Options bar.
17
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area

18
Part I: Getting Started 
Before moving to other option choices, be certain that you look over the
choices on the Options bar. If you want to use a tool like the Brush tool
or the Clone Stamp tool, perhaps you want to make a decision about
what size brush tip you want to use. This choice is specific to the
selected tool and therefore appears as an Options bar choice.
3. Open a palette for more options.
If you want to use the Brush tool, for example, to apply some color to an
image, after selecting the Brush tip on the Options bar, open the Color
Swatches palette and select a color.
4. Open the More menu.
Maybe the color you want to use doesn’t appear in the Color Swatches
palette. Your next stop is the More menu. By using the menu choices,
you can load different swatch libraries that provide more color options.
Try following the same sequence when you want to edit images in Elements by
first selecting a tool and then checking out the Options bar, opening palettes
related to providing choices for the task at hand, and, finally, clicking the
More button for additional choices in the palettes.
Looking at the Shortcuts bar
You find the Shortcuts bar just above the Options bar and below the Menu bar.
The Shortcuts bar, shown in Figure 1-9, serves two purposes:
 Quick access to common tasks: Tools on the Shortcuts bar are available
for quick access to some of the most common tasks you perform in
Elements.
 Quick access to other Elements functions: Buttons appear for quick
access to other Elements functions that involve organizing documents,
browsing photos, or viewing calendars.

and buttons. Figure 1-9 shows how the Shortcuts bar appears when you view
it in Full Edit mode.
The Shortcuts bar contains tools and buttons grouped as follows:
 The first group includes tools to toggle the Full Edit and Quick Fix
modes. 
 Click the Print tool to print a file.
 The new Print Online icon on the Shortcuts bar is used to open a 
drop-down menu where you make choices for making online orders
for printing photos.
 Click the Share tool to open a drop-down menu where you can make
choices for sharing photos by e-mail, with mobile phones, and with 
several online services.
 Click the Create tool to open a menu where you can choose from a number
of options for making creations such as greeting cards, photo albums, 
CD/DVD labels and jackets, slide shows, photo stamps, calendars,
and more.
 For a quick jump to all the wonderful organizing features provided in
Elements, such as managing photos in collections, sorting photos, cata-
loging photos, tagging photos, and more, click this tool, and you jump to
the Photoshop Elements 5 Organizer.
Changing Workspaces
When you’re in Full Edit mode, discussed in preceding sections, you can
apply any kind of edits to a picture, improve the picture’s appearance, 
and apply all that Elements offers you. This mode is the richest editor in
Elements in terms of accessing all features. Because Elements has so many
different kinds of editing opportunities, the program offers you other work-
space views, tailored to the kinds of tasks people typically want to perform.
Using Quick Fix mode
Quick Fix mode is designed to provide you with just those tools that are
needed to prepare a picture for its intended destination, whether it’s printing,
on-screen viewing, or one of the other organizing items. Use this mode to
make your pictures look good. You don’t find tools for adding text, painting

Part I: Getting Started 
with brushes, or applying gradients in Quick Fix mode. Rather, what you find
is a completely different set of palettes for balancing contrast and brightness,
lighting, and sharpening, for example. This mode is like having a digital dark-
room on your desktop, where you take care of perfecting an image like you
would in analog photography darkrooms.
To enter Quick Fix mode while you’re in Full Edit mode, click the Quick 
Fix button adjacent to the Shortcuts bar; the view changes, as shown in 
Figure 1-10.
If you want to start up Elements in Quick Fix mode, click the Quick Fix button
on the Welcome screen when you first launch the program.
Figure 1-10: Click Quick Fix in Full Edit mode, and the workspace changes.

There are several differences between Full Edit mode and Quick Fix mode:
 Completely different sets of palettes are docked in the Palette Bin.
All the palettes in Quick Fix mode are related to adjusting brightness
controls and are designed to improve the overall appearance of your
pictures. In addition, all the Windows menu commands for accessing
palettes are grayed out. While you work in Quick Fix mode, Elements
insists on limiting your use of palettes to just the ones docked in the
Palette Bin. Moreover, you cannot undock palettes from the Palette Bin
by dragging them out, as you can in other modes.
 The Tools palette disappears. Quick Fix mode offers you only these
tools in the Tools palette:
• Zoom
• Hand
• Magic Selection Brush
• Crop
• Red Eye Removal
None of the other Elements tools is accessible while you work in
this mode.
 Multiple viewing options are available.
Notice in Figure 1-10 that you see two views
of the same image. One view displays the
raw, unedited image. The After view shows
you the results of changes you make with
palette options and menu commands.
If you want to return to Full Edit mode, click the
Full Edit button.
Using Creation Wizards
To organize your pictures for display in a variety
of different ways, you begin by accessing a wizard
window respective to a particular creation you
want. From the drop-down menu shown in
Figure 1-11, you make a choice for a particular
creation, and a wizard window opens where you
follow some easy steps to produce creations such
as photo books, album pages, CD/DVD jackets,
and more.
21
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area
Figure 1-11: Click Create in
either Full Edit or Quick Fix
mode to open the Creation
Setup window.

22
Part I: Getting Started 
We cover each option available in the various wizard windows in greater
detail in Chapter 16.
Using the Photo Bin
The Photo Bin displays thumbnail views of all your open images. Regardless
of whether you work in Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, you can immediately see
a small image of all the pictures you have open at one time, as shown in
Figure 1-12. You can also see thumbnail views of all the different views you
create for a single picture. Find out all the details in this section.
Figure 1-12: All open pictures and new views are displayed as thumbnails in the Photo Bin.
If you want to rearrange the thumbnails in the Photo Bin, just click and drag
horizontally to reorganize the order of the thumbnails.
Creating different views of an image
What? Different views of the same picture, you say? Yes, indeed. You might
create a new view when you want to zoom in on an area for some precise
editing and then want to switch back to a wider view. Here’s how you do it:
1. Click a thumbnail image in the Photo Bin.
The respective photo appears in the image window as the active 
document.
2. Choose View➪New Window for <filename>.
Note that <filename> is the name of the file in the image window.
3. Zoom to the new view.
A new view appears for the active document, and you see another
thumbnail image added to the Photo Bin.

To zoom quickly, click the Zoom tool and click a few times on the picture
in the image window to zoom into the photo.
4. Toggle views of the same image.
Click one thumbnail and you see the opening view; click the other
thumbnail and you see the zoomed view.
Hiding the Photo Bin
The Photo Bin takes up a lot of room at the bottom of the image window, and
you’re not likely to want it open all the time while editing some pictures.
Fortunately, Elements provides you with two methods for hiding the Photo
Bin when you want to create a little more editing real estate.
To temporarily hide the Photo Bin, do one of the following:
 Place the cursor over the separator bar between the Image window and
the Photo Bin. When the cursor changes to two horizontal lines with 
vertical opposing arrowheads, drag down to collapse the Photo Bin.
When the bin is collapsed, drag up the separator bar to open the bin.
 To auto-hide the Photo Bin, open a context menu (right-click inside the
Photo Bin) and select Auto-hide from the menu choices. (Alternatively,
you can just click the separator bar where you see the tiny arrowhead to
show or hide the bin.) When you use Auto-hide, the Photo Bin automati-
cally hides when the cursor appears in the image window. The Photo Bin
automatically opens when you move the cursor below the separator bar.
Retracing Your Steps
Ever since Apple’s Macintosh brought a windows interface to the masses, the
Undo command has been one of the most frequently used menu commands
in every program developed. You make a change to your document, and if
you don’t like it, you simply choose Edit➪Undo or press the keyboard short-
cut Ctrl+Z/Ô+Z.
In Elements, your options to undo your work have expanded, as we explain in
this section.
Using the Undo History palette
Elements takes the Undo command to new levels by offering you a palette in
which all (well, almost all) your changes in an editing session are recorded
and available for undoing at any step in an editing sequence.
23
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area

24
Part I: Getting Started 
Each edit you make is recorded in
the Undo History palette. To open
the palette, choose Window➪Undo
History. Make changes to your docu-
ment, and each step is recorded in
the palette, as you see in Figure 1-13.
If Elements slows down and you’re
moving along at a snail’s pace, open
the More drop-down menu in the
Undo History palette and choose
Clear Undo History. Elements flushes
all the recorded history and frees up
some precious memory that often
enables you to work faster.
We said almost all steps are recorded
because the number of steps the
History palette can record is con-
trolled by a preference setting that
tops out at 1,000 steps. If you choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or
Photoshop Elements Preferences (Mac) and look at the General preferences,
as we explain in more depth in Chapter 2, the number of history states (times
you can go back in history and undo) defaults to 50. You can change the
number to the maximum 1,000, if you like. But realize that the more history
states you record, the more memory that Elements requires.
To undo the last edit, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Z/Ô+Z. When
you want to undo multiple edits, open the Undo History palette and click any
item listed in the palette. Elements takes you to that last edit while scrubbing
all edits that follow the selected item. If you want to bring back the edits, just
click again on any step appearing grayed out in the palette to redo up to that
level.
All your steps are listed in the Undo History palette as long as you remain in
Elements and don’t close the file. When the file is closed, all history informa-
tion is lost.
Reverting to the last save
As you work away in Elements, you should always plan on saving your work
regularly. Each time you save in an editing session, the Undo History palette
preserves the list of edits you made before the save and up to the maximum
number of history states defined in the General preferences.
Figure 1-13: The Undo History palette records
steps in an editing session.

If you save, and then perform more edits, and then want to return to the last
saved version of your document, Elements provides you with a quick, effi-
cient way to do so. Choose Edit➪Revert, and Elements eliminates your new
edits and takes you back to the last time you saved your file.
When you choose Revert, the word Revert appears in the Undo History
palette. You can eliminate the Revert command from the Undo History
palette by right-clicking Revert in the Undo History palette and choosing
Delete from a context menu. This command returns you to the edits made
after the last save.
Getting a Helping Hand
You can reach for this book whenever you want some details about accom-
plishing a task while working in Elements. However, for those little annoying
moments, and just in case some coffee stains blot out a few pages in this
book, you may want to look for an alternative feature description from
another source.
Rather than accumulate a library of Elements books, all you need to do is look
at Elements itself to find some valuable help information quickly and easily. If
you’re stuck on understanding some feature, ample help documents that are a
mouse click away can help you overcome some frustrating moments.
Using Help
Your first stop for exploring the helpful information Elements provides 
is on the Help menu. There, you find several menu commands that offer 
information:
 Photoshop Elements Help: Choose Help➪Photoshop Elements Help or
press the F1 key to open the Elements Help file. You can type a search
topic and press Enter to open a list of items that provide helpful infor-
mation about the searched words.
For quick access to the Help document, type the text you want to search
into the text box on the right side of the menu bar in Full Edit or Quick
Fix mode.
 Glossary of Terms: As you read this book, if we use a term that you
don’t completely understand, open the Photoshop Elements glossary.
There, you find definitions of terms commonly used in photography and
image editing as well as terms related specifically to Elements.
25

Part I: Getting Started 
 Tutorials: If you want to explore some advanced learning, check out the
online tutorials provided by Adobe Systems.
 Photoshop Elements Online: This menu command launches your
default Web browser and takes you to the Adobe Web site, where you
can find information about Elements, problems reported by users, and
some work-around methods for getting a job done.
Using PDFs from the installation CD
A number of bonus files are stored in PDF form on your installation CD. PDF
files require the free Adobe Reader program or one of the commercial
Acrobat viewers. Adobe Reader can be installed from the CD during the
installation process.
Depending on when you purchased your Elements installer CD, the version of
Adobe Reader on the CD may be outdated. If you want to stay with the latest
upgrade of Adobe Reader, open your Web browser and type this address on
the Location bar:
www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html
Adobe Systems provides easy, step-by-step instructions for downloading the
most current, free Adobe Reader program and installing it on your computer.
Using ToolTips
As you move your cursor around tools and palettes, pause a moment before
clicking the mouse. A slight delay in your actions produces a ToolTip, as shown
in Figure 1-14. Elements provides this sort of dynamic help as you move the
cursor around the workspace and pause before moving to another location.
Figure 1-14: Place the cursor over a tool and pause a moment to open a ToolTip.
Using the How To palette
The default Palette Bin in Full Edit mode contains the How To palette at the
top of the bin. The How To palette lists some of the more common tasks

you’re likely to perform in Elements. Click the right-pointing arrowhead to
expand a list, and then click an item to open help information in the palette.
You can scroll pages by clicking the arrows, return to the opening How To
page by clicking the house icon, and print a topic by clicking the printer icon
if you want to create hard copy of some help information.
Taking Charge with Shortcuts
As Emeril says, “It’s time to kick it up a notch.” Kicking it up a notch in
Elements terms means leaving the pick-and-poke editing method of the
novice and graduating to techniques used by the swift keyboard master.
Using keyboard shortcuts greatly reduces your time in Elements and makes
you much more proficient. The upside is that most of what you can do by
moving the mouse and clicking a tool or menu command can be performed
right from your keyboard by using combinations of keystrokes. The downside
is that, because Elements has so many keyboard shortcuts, remembering all
of them is nearly impossible.
The best way to remember keyboard shortcuts is to practice using them.
After that, you may want to browse the resources where shortcuts are
defined. Here are some considerations to help you remember shortcuts and
find more information about them:
 For common tasks, always take special note of ToolTips and com-
mands on a menu. ToolTips provide descriptions of what tools do and
often display the keyboard shortcuts used to access the tools. Menu
commands that support keyboard shortcuts list the shortcut keys to
the right of command names.
 Look over all the tips and alternative methods for performing an
action that we describe throughout this book. As you’re introduced to
more features in Elements, we try to offer you the keyboard shortcut
options as well as tools and commands. Rather than give you a list here,
we provide keyboard shortcuts when we explain features.
 Search the Help document. Open the Elements Help document
(choose Help➪Photoshop Elements Help or press F1) and search for
keyboard shortcuts. The Help document provides a comprehensive
list of all the keyboard shortcuts you can use in Elements.
 Stick with the essentials. Try to commit to memory only those short-
cuts that produce actions for your most common editing tasks.
The Cheat Sheet at the front of this book lists some common keyboard short-
cuts so that you can reference them quickly and easily.
27
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area

Part I: Getting Started 
Memorizing keyboard shortcuts isn’t critical to your work in Photoshop
Elements. You can do everything the program was designed for without
ever using a shortcut. However, when you become familiar with keyboard
shortcuts, you’ll zoom through editing sessions with much more speed and
efficiency. As a matter of fact, many advanced and professional users often
forget where a menu command is contained because they rely so much on
shortcut keys.

 Setting up your color management system
A
lthough not as exciting as firing up Elements and working on your pre-
cious pictures, customizing Elements for your personal work habits and
properly setting up color management is critical to everything else you do in
the program. This chapter explains how to take charge of Elements and cus-
tomize your work environment by adjusting preference settings and setting
up a color management system. If you’re new to Elements or image
editing in general, you might not know just how you want to set
up certain features right away. However, you can always
refer to this chapter and review and update settings and
options later as you become familiar with other fea-
tures in Elements.
Controlling the Editing Environment
Opening Elements for the first time is like moving
into a new office. Before you begin work, you need to
organize the office. At minimum, you need to set up
the desk and computer before you can do anything.
In Elements terms, the office organization consists of 
specifying Preference settings. Preferences are settings that
provide a means to customize your work in Elements and to fine-
tune the program according to your personal work habits.
What we offer here is a brief description of the preference options available
to you. When you need some detail regarding one preference option or
another, look at the help documents we discuss in Chapter 1. Use the help
documents as a reference and you won’t need to memorize the vast number
of settings Elements provides.

30
Part I: Getting Started 
Launching and navigating Preferences
Preferences are all contained in a dialog box that’s organized into ten panes.
By default, when you open the Preferences dialog box, the opening pane is the
General pane. To open the Preferences dialog box, choose Edit➪Preferences
(Windows) or Elements➪Preferences (Mac). Alternatively, press Ctrl+K/Ô+K.
Using either method opens the dialog box to the General pane in the
Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1: The General pane in the Preferences dialog box.
In Figure 2-1, you see items that are common to all preference panes. Here’s a
quick introduction to what these items are and how they work:
 Drop-down pane menu: Click the topmost downward-pointing arrow
and you see all individual panes listed. You can select from the menu to
jump to another pane.
 OK: Click OK to accept any changes made in any pane.
 Cancel: Click Cancel to return to the same settings as when you opened
a pane. If you hold down the Alt/Option key, the Cancel button changes
to Reset and performs the same action as clicking the Reset button.
 Reset: If you change the settings options and click Reset, the action
takes you back to the same settings as when you opened the Preferences
dialog box.
 Learn about Preferences: Click the blue text and the Adobe Help Center
opens, where you find help information that’s specific to this dialog box.

 Prev: Switch to the previous pane.
 Next: Switch to the next pane. You can also press Ctrl/Ô+(1 through 0
keys) to jump to another pane.
Checking out all the Preferences panes
The settings in the Preferences dialog box are organized into different panes
that reflect key categories of preferences. The following list briefly describes
the types of settings you can adjust in each of the Preferences panes:
 As the name implies, General preferences apply to overall general set-
tings you adjust for your editing environment.
 Saving Files preferences relate to options available for saving files.
You can choose to add extensions to filenames, save files with layers
or flatten layers when you’re saving a file (as we explain in Chapter 8),
save files with image previews that appear when you’re viewing files as
icons on your desktop, and save with some compatibility options.
 Display & Cursors preferences offer options for how certain tool cursors
are displayed and how you view the Crop tool when you’re cropping
images.
 Working with the Transparency preferences requires an understanding
of how Elements represents transparency. Imagine painting a portrait on
a piece of clear acetate. The area you paint is opaque, and the area sur-
rounding the portrait is transparent. To display transparency in Elements,
you need some method to represent transparent areas. (Chapter 7 has
more details.) Open the Transparency preferences and make choices for
how transparency is viewed in your 2-D Elements environment.
 Units & Rulers preferences let you specify settings for ruler units,
column guides, and document preset resolutions.
 The Grid preferences offer options for gridline color, divisions, and sub-
divisions. A grid shows you nonprinting horizontal and vertical lines.
You use a grid to align objects, type, and other elements. You can snap
items to the gridlines to make aligning objects much easier.
 The Plug-ins & Scratch Disks preferences contain options for selecting
an additional Plug-ins folder for storing third-party utilities to work with
Elements and scratch disks.
Assume that you have 100MB of free RAM (your internal computer
memory) and you want to work on a picture that consumes 200MB of
hard disk space. Elements needs to load all 200MB of the file into RAM.
Therefore, an auxiliary source of RAM is needed in order for you to work
on the image; Elements uses your hard drive. When a hard drive is used
as an extension of RAM, we call this source a scratch disk.
31
Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit

32
Part I: Getting Started 
If you have more than one hard drive connected to your computer, you
can instruct Elements to use all hard drives, and you can select the
order of the hard drives Elements uses for your extension of RAM. All
disks and media sources appear on the drop-down menus you see for
First, Second, Third, and Fourth.
Don’t use USB 1.1 external hard drives or other drives with connections
slower than FireWire. Using slower drives slows the performance of
Elements.
 Memory — and the need to conserve and manage it well — is important
to Elements. Another preference item for managing memory is the
Memory & Image Cache settings.
Cache is a memory location on your hard drive that Elements uses to
remember things like image levels, screen redraws, and histogram dis-
plays. (We explain more about using histograms in Chapters 4 and 10.)
When one of these items is loaded in memory, it’s stored in a cache 
location. The next time you use the same operation, Elements pulls
the item from the cache. The result is much faster access to frequently
used items.
You can set the cache level from 0 to 8 by typing a number in the text
box. Setting the number to a lower value can help you free up memory
so that you can work on large images. If you have a lot of RAM and hard
drive memory to work with, caching isn’t a concern; you can set the
cache to 8 for faster operations.
 Type preferences provide options for setting text attributes. You have
options for using different quote marks, showing Asian characters,
showing font names in English, and previewing font sizes.
 When you open the Organize & Share (Windows) preferences pane, you
lose the Preferences dialog box, and another Preferences dialog box
opens, in which choices are made for the organizing environment itself.
Because this set of preferences is handled in a completely different
dialog box, we describe it in the next section.
Controlling the Organizing Environment
(Windows only)
A whole different set of Preferences appears when you select Organize &
Share in the Preferences dialog box. Initially, you may be confused because
the dialog box that opens when you select Organize and Share is also named
Preferences. However, a quick glance at the dialog box shows you a different
set of Preferences choices. In the following sections, you find a brief introduc-
tion to the Organizer and discover all the different organization preferences
that Elements has to offer.

Understanding the Photoshop Elements Organizer
We cover all you need to know about the wonderful Adobe Photoshop
Elements Organizer tool in Chapter 6. Rather than describe in this chapter all
that the Organizer offers you, we just want you to be aware that when you’re
setting the Organize & Share preferences, you’re setting preference options
for the Organizer. To take a quick peek at the Organizer, click the Photo
Browser button while in Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode.
Navigating Organize & Share preferences
You can open the Organize & Share Preferences dialog box directly from
the Edit menu while in either Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode. Choose
Edit➪Preferences➪Organize & Share. Doing so bypasses the Editing
Preferences dialog box and takes you directly to the dialog box shown in
Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2: Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Organize & Share, and a new 
Preferences dialog box opens.
The Organize & Share Preferences dialog box uses the same metaphor to
toggle through a number of panes that the main Preferences dialog box uses.
However, selecting the individual panes is handled by clicking the names in
the list on the left side of the dialog box rather than selecting panes from a
drop-down menu. Options common to all preferences panes include:
33
Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit

34
Part I: Getting Started 
 Restore Default Settings: Click Restore Default Settings to change all
panes to their original defaults.
 OK: Click OK to accept new changes.
 Cancel: Click Cancel in any pane, and any changes made aren’t registered.
 Help: Click Help to open the Help window and find information about
Organize & Share preferences.
Setting preferences in all the panes
With the Organize & Share Preferences dialog box open, here’s a quick
overview of what you find there:
 The items in the General preferences pane affect a miscellaneous group
of settings that are applied to files when you’re using the Create tool.
Chapter 16 explains this tool in detail.
 Files preferences offer options for managing file data, connecting to
missing files, prompting for backing up your data, saving catalogs,
choosing file and folder locations for saved files, and adjusting proxy file
(a low-resolution display of a higher-resolution image) sizes.
 Folder Location View preferences provide options for showing files and
folders in groups and selected folders.
 With the Editing preferences, you can enable another application that
provides some editing features not found in Elements to edit an image
based on its file type. One good example for adding another editor is
when you’re editing video clips. If you have Adobe Premiere Elements,
you can add Premiere as another editor. If you don’t have Premiere
installed, you can use another editor, like Microsoft Media Maker or the
Apple iMovie.
 The Camera or Card Reader preferences handle acquiring images from
digital cameras and media storage cards. Your computer may have 
built-in card readers in which you can insert a media card, such as
CompactFlash or Smart Media, or a USB card reader that supports a
media card. In other cases, you may have a cable that connects from
your camera to a USB port on your computer. These preference options
are used with media cards and camera connections.
 If you scan images with a scanner connected to your computer
(as opposed to downloading them from your camera), the Scanner
preferences hold all the options you may want to set.
 Calendar preferences relate to calendar creations. You have several
options from which to choose for your calendar design. In Chapter 16,
we cover creating calendars and explain a little more about these prefer-
ence options.

 Tags and Collections preferences help you find and sort your images,
as we explain in much more detail in Chapters 5 and 6. Tag preferences
offer options for sorting tags and icon views for tags.
 If you have a mobile phone capable of taking pictures, check out the
Mobile Phone preferences. You can copy pictures from your phone to
your computer, as we explain in Chapter 4. These preferences offer
options for a folder location where mobile phone files are stored and
an option for correcting red-eye automatically as files are opened.
See Chapter 10 for more information on red-eye correction.
 Sharing preferences relate to sharing files online and in e-mail. Options
are available for setting e-mail and sharing settings.
 Services preferences offer choices for handling program updates and
online service orders. You can choose to check for program updates
automatically or manually choose options for printing and sharing
images, and update creations, accounts, and more.
Customizing Presets
Part of the fun of image editing is choosing brush tips, swatch colors, gradi-
ent colors, and patterns to create the look you want. To get you started,
Elements provides you with a number of different preset libraries that can be
loaded and used at your will. For example, you can load a Brushes library to
acquire different brush tips you use with the Brush tool. But you’re likely to
want to customize the preset libraries at least a little bit, too.
You can change libraries individually
in respective palettes where the items
are used. For example, you can change
color swatch libraries on the Color
Swatches palette or brush tips from
Options bar choices. Another way
you can change libraries is to use the
Preset Manager, shown in Figure 2-3.
We cover using the presets in
Chapter 12, which is where you
can find out how to use the many 
different presets Elements provides.
The important thing to note here is
that you can change the presets according to your editing needs.
To open the Preset Manager dialog box, choose Edit➪Preset Manager. The
options you have available include:

Part I: Getting Started 
 Preset Type: Open the drop-down menu to choose from Brushes,
Swatches, Gradients, and Patterns.
 More: The More drop-down menu lists different viewing options.
You can view the library items as text lists or as thumbnail views.
 Done: Any changes you make in the Preset Manager are recorded and
saved when you click Done.
 Load: Click this button to open another library. Elements provides you
with several libraries from which to choose for each preset type.
 Save Set: Any changes you make in the Preset Manager can be saved
as a new library. Use this option if you make a change so that you don’t
disturb the original presets.
 Rename: Each item in a library has a unique name. If you want to
rename an item, click the thumbnail in the Preview window, click
Rename, and type a new name in the dialog box that appears.
 Delete: Click an item in the Preview window and click Delete to remove
the item from the library.
 Help: Click the blue The Preset Manager text to open the Help document
and find out more about managing presets.
Getting Familiar with Color
We could spend a whole lot of time and many pages in this book delving into
the complex world of color theory and definitions. You wouldn’t likely read it,
and we’re not so inclined to reduce this book from a real page-turner to
something that’s likely to sedate you. Rather, in the following sections, we
offer some fundamental principles to make your work in Elements easier
when you’re editing color images.
Introducing color channels
Your first level of understanding color is to understand what RGB is and how
it comes about. RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue. These are the primary
colors in the computer world. Forget about what you know about primary
colors in an analog world; computers see primary colors as RGB.
RGB color is divided into color channels. Although you can’t see the individ-
ual channels in Elements, you still need to understand just a little about color
channels.

When you see a color pixel (a tiny, square dot), the color is represented as
different levels of gray in each channel. This may sound confusing at first, but
stay with us for just a minute. When you have a color channel, like the red
channel, and you let all light pass through the channel, you end up with a
bright red. If you screen that light a little with a gray filter, you let less light
pass through, thereby diluting the red color. This is how channels work.
Individually, they all use different levels of gray that permit up to 256 levels of
light to pass through them. When you change the intensity of light in the dif-
ferent channels, you ultimately change the color.
Each channel can have up to 256 levels of gray that mask out light. The total
number of possibilities for creating color in an RGB model is achieved by
multiplying the values for each channel (256 x 256 x 256). The result is more
than 16.7 million; that’s the total number of colors a computer monitor can
display in RGB color.
This is all well and good as far as
theory goes, but what does that
mean in practicality? Actually, you
see some of this information in tools
and dialog boxes you work with in
Elements. As an experiment, open
a file in Elements and choose
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels;
the dialog box shown in Figure 2-4
opens.
Notice that the Channel drop-down
menu shows you Red, Green, and
Blue as individual channels as well
as a composite RGB selection.
Furthermore, the Output Levels area
shows you values ranging from 0 on the left to 255 on the right. Considering
that 0 is a number, you have a total of 256 different levels of gray.
What’s important is that you know that your work in color is related to RGB
images that comprise three different channels. There are 256 levels of gray that
can let through or hold back light and change brightness values and color. See
Chapters 9 and 10 for more on using tools like levels to adjust color in this way.
Understanding bit depth
Another important item to understand about channels is bit depth. A bit
holds one of two values; one value is for black, the other for white.

Part I: Getting Started 
When you have 256 levels of gray, you’re working with an 8-bit-per-channel
image — 8 bits with two possible values each = 28 = 256 possible levels of
gray. Multiply 8 bits per channel times your 3 channels and you get 24 bits,
which is the common bit depth of images you print on your desktop printer.
Now, take a look at the Image➪Mode
menu. You should see a menu selec-
tion that says 8 Bits/Channel, as
shown in Figure 2-5. When you open
an image in Elements, if this menu
command is grayed out, you’re work-
ing with a 24-bit image, or an image
of 8 bits per channel.
What does it mean when you can
select the 8 Bit/Channel menu com-
mand? You can be certain that your
image isn’t an 8-bit-per-channel
image. You may be able to select
this command because some digi-
tal cameras and most low-end, 
consumer-grade scanners can cap-
ture images at higher bit depths. You can scan a photo on a scanner at 16 bits
per channel. When you do, you end up with many more levels of gray. When
you take a picture with a quality digital camera, you can capture 32-bit-per-
channel images, and you end up with a file containing 32,768 levels of gray.
That’s a lot!
Now, here’s the catch. All files need to be reduced to 8 bits per channel
before you print them because that’s all the information any printer uses.
In addition, many tools, commands, and palette options work with only 
8-bit-per-channel images. So you ask, “What’s the benefit of acquiring images
at higher bit depths than I can print them?”
If you attempt to adjust brightness and contrast or other image enhance-
ments in an 8-bit-per-channel image, you often destroy some data. You can
cause some noticeable image degradation if you move adjustment sliders
too far while working with 8-bit-per-channel images. When you edit your 
16-bit and 32-bit images, you don’t destroy data — you simply inform
Elements which 256 of the total available levels of gray you want to use.
The result is an image with more continuous gray tones than you can achieve
in 8 bit-per-channel images. (For more on image bit-depth, see Chapter 3.)
Figure 2-5: When you can choose 8 Bits/
Channel, you know that your image bit depth is
higher than 8 bits per channel.

Getting Color Right
In Elements, when it comes to color, the challenge isn’t understanding color
theory or definitions, but rather matching the RGB color you see on your
computer monitor as closely as possible to your output. Output can be a
printout from a color printer or a screen view on a Web page.
We say match “as closely as possible” because you can never expect to achieve
a perfect match. You have far too many printer and monitor variables to deal
with. The best you can hope for is a very close match.
To match color between your monitor and your output, you need to first 
calibrate your monitor and then choose a color workspace profile. In the 
following sections, you find all the details.
Calibrating your monitor
Your monitor needs to be calibrated to adjust the gamma and brightness,
correct any color tints or colorcasts, and generally get your monitor to dis-
play, as precisely as possible, accurate colors on your output. You have a few
choices for which tool you can use to adjust monitor brightness, ranging
from a low-cost hardware device that costs less than $100 to expensive cali-
bration equipment of $3,000 or more — or you can skip the hardware and use
tools provided by Adobe or your OS developer, depending on which platform
you use, to set up your monitor.
Gamma is the brightness of midlevel tones in an image. In technical terms,
it’s a parameter that describes the shape of the transfer function for one or
more stages in an imaging pipeline.
We skip the high-end costly devices and software utilities that don’t do you
any good and suggest that you make, at the very least, one valuable purchase
for creating a monitor profile: a hardware profiling system. On the low end,
some affordable devices go a long way in helping you adjust your monitor
brightness and color balance:
 ColorVision Spyder2express: This is one of the newer calibration
devices on the market. For as low as $69 US, you can purchase an easy-
to-use, three-step device to balance the color on your monitor and
adjust it for optimum brightness (PC/Mac). This device is receiving 
five-star ratings at online resellers, including www.amazon.com.
 Pantone Huey Monitor Color Correction: This is another new, low-cost
calibration system used for calibrating both CRTs and LCDs. It supports
both Mac and Windows. This unit retails for $88 US and sells for $74.95
at Amazon.com as of this writing.

Part I: Getting Started 
 GretagMacBeth Eye-One Display 2: For a little more money, you can
order a calibration device from GretagMacBeth — a company that has
long been a leader in sophisticated hardware equipment for creating 
calibrations and color profiles. Our choice for a low-end device with
superb capabilities is the GretagMacBeth Eye-One Display 2 (www.
gretagmacbeth.com), which costs a little more: $249 as of this writing.
 Eye-One Display 2: This device,
like the Spyder2express and
Huey, is an easy-to-use profiling
tool that works with CRT 
displays, LCDs, and laptop 
computers. You attach the suc-
tion cup to your monitor (see
Figure 2-6) and click a few but-
tons in the software application
accompanying the hardware,
and Eye-One Display 2 eventu-
ally prompts you to save a 
monitor profile. The profile you
create is automatically used by
your operating system when
you start up your computer.
When the profile kicks in, your
monitor is balanced using the settings that were determined when the
calibration was performed by the device.
On LCD monitors, you need to adjust some of the hardware controls to
bring your monitor into a match for overall brightness between your monitor
and your photo prints. Be certain to run many test prints and match your
prints against your monitor view to bring the two together as closely as 
possible.
You have a lot to focus on to calibrate monitors and get color right on your
monitor and your output. We talk more about color output in Chapter 14.
For a good resource for color correction and printing, we recommend that
you look at Color Management For Digital Photographers For Dummies, by
Ted Padova and Don Mason (Wiley Publishing).
Choosing a color workspace
After you get your monitor color adjusted by using a hardware profiling
system, your next step is to choose your color workspace. In Elements, you
have a choice between choosing one of two workspace colors: either sRGB 
or Adobe RGB (1998). You access your color workspace settings by choosing
Edit➪Color Settings. The Color Settings dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 2-7.

device.

Figure 2-7: The Color Settings dialog box.
The options you have in the Color Settings dialog box include:
 No Color Management: This choice turns off all color management.
Don’t choose this option for any work you do in Elements.
 Always Optimize Colors for Computer Screens: Checking this radio
button sets your workspace to sRGB. sRGB color is used quite often for
viewing images on your monitor. But this workspace often results in the
best choice for color printing too. Many color printers can output all the
colors you can see in the sRGB workspace. In addition, many photo serv-
ices, such as the Kodak EasyShare services we talk about in Chapter 16,
prefer this workspace color.
 Always Optimize for Printing: Checking this option sets your color
workspace to Adobe RGB (1998). The color in this workspace has more
available colors than can be seen on your monitor. If you choose this
workspace, you need to be certain that your printer is capable of using
all the colors in this color space.
 Allow Me to Choose: When you choose this option, Elements prompts
you for a profile assignment when you open images containing no pro-
file. This setting is handy if you work back and forth between screen and
print images.
Understanding how profiles work
You probably created a monitor color profile when you calibrated your moni-
tor. You probably also selected a color profile when you opened the Color
Settings dialog box and selected your workspace color. When you start your
41
Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit

42
Part I: Getting Started 
computer, your monitor color profile kicks in and adjusts your overall moni-
tor brightness and correction for any colorcasts. When you open a photo in
Elements, color is automatically converted from your monitor color space to
your workspace color.
At print time, you use another color profile to output your photos to your
desktop color printer. Color is then converted from your workspace color
to your printer’s color space. In Chapter 14, we show you how to use color
profiles for printing. For now, just realize that each one of these color pro-
files, and using them properly, determines whether you can get good color
output.

W
hen you open a picture in Photoshop Elements, you’re looking at a
huge mass of pixels. These pixels are tiny, colored squares, and the
number of pixels in a picture determines the picture’s resolution.
This relationship between pixels and resolution, which is
important for you to understand in all your Elements
work, relates to creating selections (as we explain in
Chapter 7), printing files (Chapter 14), and sharing files
(Chapter 16).
Color modes are also represented as collections of
pixels. Color modes are also important when you’re
using tools and printing and sharing files.
This chapter explains some essential points about
resolution, color modes, and the file formats you use
to save your Elements images. We talk about changing
resolution by resizing images, converting color modes,
and saving the results in different file formats.

44
Part I: Getting Started 
The Ubiquitous Pixels
Files you open in Elements are composed of thousands or maybe millions of
tiny, square pixels. Each pixel has one, and only one, color value. The arrange-
ment of the pixels of different shades and colors creates an illusion to your
eyes when you’re viewing an image on-screen. For example, you may have
black and white pixels arranged in an order that creates the impression that
you’re looking at something gray — not at tiny black and white squares.
Just about everything you do in Elements has to do with changing pixels.
You surround them with selection tools to select what appear to be objects
in your image, you make pixels darker or lighter to change contrast and
brightness, you change shades and tints of pixels for color correction, and
you perform a host of other editing possibilities.
We also have another term to throw at you when talking about pixels and
Elements files: Your pictures are called raster images. When you have pixels,
you have raster data. If you open a file in Elements that wasn’t made up of
pixels, Elements rasterizes the data. In other words, Elements converts other
data to pixels if the document wasn’t originally composed of pixels.
In addition to raster data, there’s also vector data, which we talk more about
in Chapter 13. For this chapter, you just need to focus on raster data.
To use most of the tools and commands in Elements, you must be working on
a raster image file. If your data isn’t rasterized, many tools and commands
are unavailable.
Understanding resolution
The number of pixels in a file determines its image resolution. If you have 72
pixels across a 1-inch horizontal line, your image is 72 pixels per inch (ppi).
If you have 300 pixels in 1 inch, your image resolution is 300 ppi.
Image resolution is critical to properly outputting files in these instances:
 When you print images: If the resolution is too low, the image prints
poorly. If the image resolution is too high, you waste time processing all
the data that needs to be sent to your printer.
 When you show images on-screen: Just as images have resolution
inherent in their files, your computer monitor displays everything you
see on it in a fixed resolution. Computer monitors display images at
72 ppi. That’s all you get. What’s important to know is that the best view-
ing of photos on your computer monitor is always when you’re viewing
images at a 72 ppi image size in a 100 percent view.

As an example, take a look at Figure 3-1. You see an image reduced to
50 percent and then at different zoom sizes. As the sizes change, the res-
olution display on your monitor changes. When the size is 100 percent,
you see the image exactly as it will print. The 100 percent size repre-
sents the image displayed on your monitor at 72 ppi, regardless of the
resolution of the file.
This relationship between the image resolution and viewing at different zoom
levels is an important concept to grasp. If you grab an image off the Web
and zoom in on it, you may see a view like the 800 percent view shown in
Figure 3-1. If you acquire a digital camera image, you may need to zoom out
to a 16 percent view to fit the entire image in the Image window.
The reason that these displays vary so much is all image resolution. That Web
page image you grabbed off the Web might be a 2-inch-square image at 72 ppi,
and that digital camera image might be a 10-x-15-inch image at 240 ppi. To fill
the entire window with the Web image, you need to zoom in on the file. As you
zoom in, the resolution is lowered. The more you zoom, the lower the resolu-
tion on your monitor.

Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats

46
Part I: Getting Started 
As you zoom in or out of an image, you change the resolution as it appears on
your monitor. No resolution changes are made to the file. The image resolu-
tion remains the same until you use one of the Elements tools to reduce or
add to image resolution.
Understanding image dimensions
Image dimensions involve the physical size of your file. If the size is 4 x 5 inches,
for example, the file can be any number of different resolution values. After the
file is opened in Elements, you can change the dimensions of an image, the
resolution, or both.
When you change only the dimensions of an image (not the number of pixels
it contains), an inverse relationship exists between the physical size of your
image and the resolution. As image size is increased, resolution decreases.
Conversely, as you raise resolution, you lower image size.
The Art of Resampling
In some cases, images are too large and you need to reduce their resolution
and physical size. In other cases, you might need a higher resolution to
output your images at larger sizes. This method of sizing — changing the size
as well as the number of pixels — is referred to as resampling an image.
Specifically, reducing resolution is called downsampling, and raising resolu-
tion is known as upsampling.
Use caution when you resample images; when you resample, you toss
away pixels or manufacture new pixels. We discuss the details later in this
section.
Changing image size and resolution
You can change an image’s size and resolution in a couple of different ways.
One method is cropping images. You can use the Crop tool with or without
resampling images. For more information on using the Crop tool, see Chapter 9.
Another method is to use the Image Size dialog box, which you use in many
of your editing sessions in Elements.
To resize an image with the Image Size dialog box, follow these steps:

1. Choose Image➪Resize➪
Image Size.
Alternatively, you can use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+I
(or Ô+Option+I on the Mac).
The Image Size dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 3-2.
The Pixel Dimensions area in the
Image Size dialog box shows the
file size (such as 11.9M). This
number is the amount of space
the image takes up on your hard
drive. The width and height
values are fixed unless you click
the Resample Image check box
at the bottom of the dialog box.
2. In the Document Size area, you
can redefine dimensions and resolution. The options are
• Width: Type a value in the text box to resize the image’s width, and
then press Tab to move out of the field to implement the change.
From the drop-down menu to the right of the text box, you can
choose a unit of measure: percent, inches, centimeters, millime-
ters, points, picas, or columns.
• Height: The Height options are the same as the Width options with
the exception of no column setting. If you keep the sizing propor-
tional, you typically edit either the Width or Height text box, but
not both. As you size either width or height, the resolution sizes
inversely.
• Resolution: Edit the text box to change resolution and press the
Tab key to change the value. As resolution is edited, the Width
and Height values are changed inversely (when the Constrain
Proportions check box is checked).
3. If you’re okay with resampling your image to get the desired size,
select the Resample Image check box.
With this check box selected, you can change dimensions and pixels at
the same time, which results in reducing or increasing the number of
pixels. When the box is unchecked, the values for dimensions are linked.
Changing one value automatically changes the other values.
Before you resample your image, however, be sure to check out the sec-
tion “Understanding the results of resampling,” later in this chapter.

48
Part I: Getting Started 
4. If you select the Resample Image check box, you can choose a resam-
pling method as well as other resample options.
In the drop-down list, you find choices for choosing a resampling
method. See Table 3-1 for details. The two check boxes above the
Resample Image check box become active when you select the
Resample Image box. Here’s what they do:
• Scale Styles: Elements has a Styles palette from which you add a
variety of different style effects to images. (See Chapter 11 for
details.) When you apply a style, like a frame border, the border
appears at a defined width. When you select the Scale Styles box
and then resize the image, the Styles effect is also resized. Leaving
the check box unselected keeps the style at the same size while
the image is resized.
• Constrain Proportions: By default, this check box is selected, and
you want to keep it that way unless you want to intentionally dis-
tort an image.
5. When you’re done selecting your options, click OK to resize your
image.

screen resolutions and Web pages.

Understanding the results of resampling
As a general rule, reducing resolution is okay, but increasing resolution isn’t.
If you need a higher-resolution image and you can go back to the original
source, like rescanning the image or reshooting a picture, always favor creat-
ing a new file using the resolution you want over resampling in Elements. In
many cases, images being upsampled can be severely degraded.
If you take a picture with a digital
camera and you want to add the pic-
ture to a Web page, the image needs
to be sampled at 72 ppi. In most
cases, you visit the Image Size dialog
box, select the Resample Image
check box, add a width or height
value, and type 72 in the Resolution
text box. What you end up with is an
image that looks great on your Web
page. In Figure 3-3, you can see an
image that was downsampled in
Elements from over 14 inches hori-
zontal width.
If you start out with an image that
was originally sampled for a Web
page and you want to print a large
poster, you can forget about using
Elements or any other image editor.
Upsampling low-resolution images
often turns them to mush, as you can
see in Figure 3-4.
You might wonder whether upsam-
pling can be used for any purpose.
In some cases, yes, you can upsam-
ple with some satisfactory results.
You can experience better results
with higher resolutions of 300 ppi and more if the resample size isn’t extraor-
dinary. If all else fails, try applying a filter to a grainy, upsampled image to
mask the problem. Chapter 11 has the details.

Part I: Getting Started 
Choosing a Resolution for Print or On-Screen
The importance of resolution in your Elements work is paramount to printing
files. Good ol’ 72 ppi images can be forgiving, and you can get many of your
large files scrunched down to 72 ppi for Web sites and slide shows. With output
to printing devices, it’s another matter. There are many different printing
output devices, and their resolution requirements vary.
For your own desktop printer, plan to print a variety of test images at differ-
ent resolutions. You can quickly determine the best file attributes by running
tests. When you send files to service centers, ask the technicians what file
attributes work best with their equipment.
For a starting point, look over the recommended resolutions for various
output devices listed in Table 3-2.

Go Ahead — Make My Mode!
Regardless of what output you prepare your files for, you need to consider
color mode and file format. In Chapter 2, we talk about RGB color mode.
This color mode is what you use to prepare color files for printing on your
desktop color printer or for preparing files for photo service centers.
You can also use color modes other than RGB. If you start with an RGB color
image and you want to convert to a different color mode, you have menu
options for converting color. Photoshop Elements uses an algorithm (a math-
ematical formula) to convert pixels from one mode to another. In some cases,
the conversion that’s made via a menu command produces good results, and
in other cases, you can use some different options for converting modes.

In the following sections, we introduce the modes that are available in Elements
and explain how to convert from RGB to the mode of your choice: bitmap,
grayscale, or indexed color.
Another mode you may have heard of is CMYK. Although CMYK mode isn’t
available in Photoshop Elements, you should be aware of what it is and the
purposes of CMYK images. CMYK, commonly referred to as process color,
contains percentages of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black colors. This mode
is used for commercial printing. If you design a magazine cover in Elements
and send off the file to a print shop, the file is ultimately converted to CMYK.
Converting to bitmap mode
Bitmap mode is most commonly used in printing line art, such as black-and-
white logos, illustrations, or black-and-white effects you create from your
RGB images. Also, you can scan your analog signature as a bitmap image and
import it into other programs, such as the Microsoft Office programs. If you’re
creative, you can combine bitmap images with RGB color to produce many
interesting effects.
The Elements bitmap mode isn’t the
same as the Windows .bmp file
format. In Elements, bitmap mode is
a color mode. A .bmp file can be an
RGB color mode image, a grayscale
color mode image, or a bitmap color
mode image.
One important thing to keep in mind
is that, when you combine images
into single documents, as we explain
in Chapter 8, you need to convert
bitmap files to grayscale or color if
you want to merge the images with
an RGB image. If you convert to
grayscale, Elements takes care of
converting grayscale to RGB mode.
As an example of an effect resulting
from combining grayscale and
color images, look over Figure 3-5.
The original RGB image was con-
verted to a bitmap and then saved as
a different file. The bitmap was con-
verted to grayscale and dropped on
top of the RGB image. After adjusting
the opacity, the result is a grainy
effect with desaturated color.
51
Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Figure 3-5: You can create some interesting
effects by combining the same image from a
bitmap file and an RGB file.

52
Part I: Getting Started 
You can acquire bitmap (.bmp) mode images directly in Elements when you
scan images that are black and white. Illustrated art, logos, your signature, or
a copy of a fax might be the kind of files you scan directly in bitmap mode.
Additionally, you can convert your images to bitmap mode.
Converting RGB color to bitmap is a two-step process. You need to first con-
vert to grayscale, and then convert from grayscale to bitmap. If you select the
Bitmap menu command while in RGB color, Elements prompts you to convert
to grayscale first.
To convert RGB mode to bitmap mode, do the following:
1. Open an image that you want to convert to bitmap mode in either
Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode.
2. Choose Image➪Mode➪Bitmap.
If you start in RGB mode, Elements prompts you to convert to 
grayscale.
3. Click OK, and the Bitmap dialog box opens.
The Bitmap dialog box provides options for selecting the output resolu-
tion and a conversion method.
4. Select a resolution.
By default, the Bitmap dialog
box, shown in Figure 3-6, dis-
plays the current resolution.
You can edit the text box and
type a new resolution value or
accept the default.
5. From the Method drop-down
menu, you can choose from
these settings:
• 50% Threshold
• Pattern Dither
• Diffusion Dither
Look over Figure 3-7, and you can see a comparison of the different
methods used in converting RGB images to bitmaps.
6. Click OK to convert your image to Bitmap mode.
Figure 3-6: Type a resolution for your output
and select the conversion method from the Use
drop-down menu.

Figure 3-7: An original RGB image converted to bitmap using 50% Threshold, Pattern Dither,
and Diffusion Dither.
Converting to grayscale mode
Grayscale images have black and white pixels and any one of 256 levels of
gray. By converting an RGB image to grayscale, you can make it look like a
black-and-white photo.
You can convert an image to grayscale in one of three ways, but remember
that one of these methods isn’t as good as the others. We recommend that
you avoid converting to grayscale by choosing Image➪Mode➪Grayscale.
When Elements performs this conversion, it removes all the color from the

pixels, so you lose some precious data during the conversion and can’t regain
the color after conversion. If you convert an image to grayscale, save the file,
and delete the original from your hard drive or memory card, the color image
is lost forever. You can save a secondary file, but this method can add a little
confusion and require some more space on your hard drive.
As an alternative to using the menu command for converting images to
grayscale, try this method:
1. Open an RGB image in Elements.
2. Duplicate a layer.
The default Palette Bin contains
the Layers palette. In this
palette, you find a pop-up menu
when you click More in the
upper-right corner. From the
menu commands, choose
Duplicate Layer. (For more infor-
mation on working with layers,
see Chapter 8.)
3. Choose Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation
(or press Ctrl+U) to open the
Hue/Saturation dialog box.
4. Drag the Saturation slider
to the far left, as shown in
Figure 3-8, to desaturate the
image.
All color disappears, but the
brightness values of all the
pixels remain unaffected. (For

the other Adjust Color com-
mands, see Chapter 10.)
5. Turn off the color layer by
clicking the eye icon.
In the Layers palette, you see two
layers, as shown in Figure 3-9.
You don’t need to turn off the
color layer to print the file in
grayscale, but turning it off can
help you remember which color
layer you used the last time you
printed or exported the file.
Figure 3-8: Open the Hue/Saturation dialog box
and move the Saturation slider to the far left to
eliminate color.
Figure 3-9: The Layers palette shows the
grayscale and color layers. You can turn layers
on or off by clicking the eye icon.

Following the preceding steps provides you with a file that contains both
RGB and grayscale. If you want to print the color layer, you can turn off the
grayscale layer. If you need to exchange files with graphic designers, you can
send the layered file and then the design professional can use both the color
image and the grayscale image.
The other advantage of converting RGB color to grayscale by using the Hue/
Saturation dialog box is that you don’t disturb any changes in the brightness
values of the pixels. Moving the Saturation slider to desaturate the image
affects only the color. The luminance and lightness values remain the same.
A new menu command has been introduced in Elements 5. Choose Enhance➪
Convert to Black and White in either Standard Edit mode or Quick Fix mode,
and you see the Convert to Black and White dialog box, shown in Figure 3-10.

Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats

56
Part I: Getting Started 
This dialog box contains many controls for adjusting brightness and contrast
in images you convert to grayscale. You select from some preset options by
selecting the radio buttons under the Select a Style heading. You move the
Amount slider in the Adjustment Intensity area and then fine-tune your
adjustments by clicking thumbnail previews in the third area, where you
see small image previews.
If you want to keep your original RGB image in the same file as the grayscale
version, duplicate the background by choosing Duplicate Layer from the
Layers palette More menu. Click the background and choose Enhance➪
Convert to Black and White. The conversion is applied to only the back-
ground while leaving the Background copy layer in your original color mode.
Converting to indexed color mode
Indexed color is a mode you use occasionally with Web graphics, such as
saving in GIF format. When saving indexed color images, you can, at times,
create smaller file sizes than RGB that are ideal for using in Web site designs.
RGB images in 24-bit color (8 bits per channel) are capable of rendering
colors from a palette of 16.7 million colors, as we explain in Chapter 2. An
indexed color image is an 8-bit image with only a single channel. The total
number of colors you get with indexed color can be no more than 256.
When you convert RGB images to indexed color, you can choose to dither
the color, which displays the image with a dithered effect much like you see
with bitmapped images. This dithering effect makes the file appear as though
it has more than 256 colors, and the transition between colors appears
smoother than if no dithering were applied.
On occasion, indexed color images have an advantage over RGB images when
hosting the images on Web servers: The fewer colors in a file, the smaller the
file size. When you prepare images for Web hosting, you can choose to use
indexed color or RGB color. Whether you choose one over the other really
depends on how well the image appears on your monitor. If you have some
photos that you want to show on Web pages, you should use RGB images and
save them in a format appropriate for Web hosting, as we explain a little later
in this chapter.
If you have files composed of artwork such as logos, illustrations, and draw-
ings, you may find that the appearance of index colors is no different from
viewing the same images as RGB. If that’s the case, you can keep the index
color image and use it for your Web pages.
To convert RGB images to indexed color, choose Image➪Mode➪Indexed
Color; the Indexed Color dialog box opens. A number of different options are
available to you, and, fortunately, you can preview the results as you make
choices. Get in and poke around, and you can see the options applied in the
image window.

Saving Files with Purpose
Photoshop Elements files are saved in a variety of different formats. Some
format types require you to convert a color mode before the format can be
used. Therefore, a relationship exists between file formats and saving files.
Additionally, bit depths in images also relate to the kinds of file formats you
can use in saving files.
Before you go too far in Elements, become familiar with file formats and the
conversions that need to be made to save in one format or another. If you do
nothing to an image in terms of converting modes or changing bit depth, you
can save a file after editing in the same format in which the file was opened.
In many circumstances, you open an image and prepare it for some form of
output, which requires more thought about the kind of file format you use in
saving the file.
Using the Save/Save As dialog box
In most any program, the Save (or Save As) dialog box is a familiar place
where you make some choices about the file to be saved. Using Save As, you
can save a duplicate copy of your image or a modified copy and retain the
original file.
To use the Save (or Save As) dialog box, choose File➪Save for files to be
saved the first time, or choose File➪Save As for any file, and a dialog box
then opens.
The standard navigational tools you find in any Save dialog box appear in the
Elements Save/Save As dialog box. Here are some standard options you find
in the Elements Save/Save As dialog box:
 File name: This item is common to all Save dialog boxes. Type a name
for your file in the text box.
 Format: From the drop-down menu, you select file formats. We explain
the formats supported by Elements later in this chapter.
A few options make the Photoshop Elements Save/Save As dialog box dif-
ferent from other Save dialog boxes you might be accustomed to using.
The Save Options area in the Save As dialog box provides these choices:
 Include in the Organizer: If you want the file added to the Organizer,
select this check box. (For more information about using the Organizer,
see Chapter 6.)
 Save in Version Set with Original: You can edit images and save a ver-
sion of your image, but only in Quick Fix mode. When you save the file
from Quick Fix mode, this check box is active. Select the box and a ver-
sion of the original is saved and appears in the Organizer.
57
Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats

58
Part I: Getting Started 
 Color: Check the box for ICC (International Color Consortium) Profile.
Depending on which profile you’re using, the option appears for sRGB or
Adobe RGB (1998). When the check box is selected, the profile is embed-
ded in the image. See Chapter 2 for more information on profiles.
 Thumbnail: This option relates to your Saving Files preferences, which
we discuss in Chapter 2. If you save a file with a thumbnail, you can see
a miniature representation of your image when viewing it in folders or
on the desktop. If you select Ask When Saving in the Saving Files prefer-
ences, the check box can be enabled or disabled. If you’re choosing an
option for Never Save or Always Save in the Preferences dialog box, this
box is enabled or disabled for you and is grayed out. You need to return
to the Preferences dialog box if you want to change the option.
 Use Lower Case Extension: File extensions give you a clue to which file
format was used when a file was saved. Elements automatically adds the
extension to the filename for you. Your choices are to use uppercase or
lowercase letters for the extension name. Select the check box for Use
Lower Case Extension for lowercase, or deselect the check box if you
want to use uppercase characters in the filename.
Saving files for the Web
You save files for Web hosting in a different dialog box than when you’re
saving files for other output. Choose File➪Save for Web, and the Save for Web
dialog box opens. We explain all you need to know about how to use the Save
for Web dialog box for saving Web images in Chapter 15.
Understanding file formats
When you save files from Elements, you need to pick a file format in the
Format drop-down menu found in both the Save and Save As dialog boxes.
As you choose from the different format options, keep the following informa-
tion in mind:
 File formats are especially important when you exchange files with other
users. Each format has a purpose, and other programs can accept or
reject files depending on the format you choose.
 Whether you can select one format or another when you save a file
depends on the color mode and the bit depth and on whether layers are
present. If a format isn’t present in the Format drop-down menu when
you attempt to save a file, return to one of the edit modes and perform
some kind of edit, such as changing a color mode or flattening layers, in
order to save the file in your chosen format.

For a glimpse at all the file formats
available to you, open a standard
RGB color image in Standard Edit
mode, choose File➪Save As, and click
the down arrow to open the Format
drop-down menu. As you can see in
Figure 3-11, you have many options
for choosing a format.
In the following sections, we explain
most of the file formats supported by
Elements and the purpose for each
format.
Photoshop (*.PSD, *.PDD)
This format is the native file format
for both Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements. The format supports saving all color modes and bit depths, and
you can preserve layers. Use this format when you want to save in a native
format or exchange files with Photoshop users. Also use it for saving files
that you need to return to for more editing. When you save layers, any text
you add to layers can be edited when you return to the file. (See Chapter 13
for more information on adding text to an image.)
BMP (*.BMP, *.RLE, *.DIB)
The term bitmap can be a little confusing. You have both a file format type
that’s bitmap and a color mode that’s also bitmap. Don’t confuse the two.
The bitmap format supports saving in all color modes and in all bit
depths. The bitmap color mode, which we cover earlier in this chapter, is 
1-bit black-and-white only.
Use the bitmap format when you want to add images to system resources,
such as wallpaper for your desktop. Bitmap is also used with many different
application programs. If you can’t import images in other program docu-
ments, try to save them as BMP files.
CompuServe GIF (*.GIF)
Barb was a college coed, and Ted had a mustache and wore a green leisure
suit when CompuServe was the host for our e-mail accounts. We exchanged
files and mail on 300 baud modems. Later, in 1987, CompuServe developed
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) to exchange files between mainframe
computers and the ever-growing number of users working on Osborne,
Kaypro, Apple, and Radio Shack TRS-80 computers.

Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Figure 3-11: Open the Format drop-down menu
in either the Save or Save As dialog box, and
the formats supported by Elements appear.

60
Part I: Getting Started 
GIF is now a popular format for hosting Web graphics. GIF images can be
indexed color or animated images and support the smallest file sizes. Use
this format when you need fewer than 256 colors and when you want to
create animation in your images. 
Photoshop EPS (*.EPS)
Photoshop EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files are sometimes used by
graphic artists when they’re designing jobs for commercial printing. The
more popular format for creative professionals is TIFF, but Photoshop EPS
has some advantages not found in other formats.
Depending on the color mode of your
image, you have different options
when you’re using the Photoshop
EPS file format. Select the format in
the Save/Save As dialog box and click
Save. If you’re working on a bitmap
image (1 bit), the EPS Options dialog
box, shown in Figure 3-12, opens.
It offers an option to save trans-
parency wherever white appears in
your document.
Notice the Transparent Whites check box. You might have a circular logo for
which you want the area around the circle to appear transparent. If you
import the graphical image in another program, you can see the black in the
image while all the white area is transparent and shows any background
through what was white in the original bitmap image. If you save a file in a
higher bit depth, the EPS Options dialog box doesn’t provide an option for
making whites transparent.
JPEG (*.JPG, *.JPEG, *.JPE)
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is perhaps the most common file
format now in use. JPEG files are used with e-mail attachments and by many
photo labs for printing files, and they can be viewed in JPEG viewers and
directly in Web browsers. Just about every program capable of importing
images supports the JPEG format. Creative professionals wouldn’t dream of
using the JPEG format in design layouts, but everyone else uses the format
for all kinds of documents.
You need to exercise some caution when you’re using the JPEG format. JPEG
files are compressed to reduce file size. You can scrunch an image of several
megabytes into a few hundred kilobytes. When you save a file with JPEG com-
pression, you experience data loss. You might not see this on your monitor,
Figure 3-12: When you’re working on 1-bit
bitmap images, this dialog box offers an option
to save transparency where white appears in
the document.

or it might appear noticeably on photo prints if you’re using low compression
while preserving higher quality. However, when you save with maximum 
compression, more pixels are tossed away, and you definitely notice image
degradation.
As you save, open, and resave images in JPEG format, each new save
degrades an image more. If you need to submit JPEG images to photo 
labs for printing your pictures, keep saving in Photoshop PSD file format
until you’re ready to save the final image. Save in JPEG format when you
want to save the final file for printing, and use a low compression with high
quality.
When you select JPEG for the format
and click Save, the JPEG Options
dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 3-13. You choose the amount
of compression by typing a value in
the Quality text box or by moving the
slider below the Quality text box.
The acceptable ranges are from 0 to
12, where 0 is the lowest quality and
results in the highest compression,
and 12 is the highest quality that
results in the lowest amount of 
compression.
Notice that you also have choices in
the Format area of the JPEG Options
dialog box. The Progressive option
creates a progressive JPEG file com-
monly used with Web browsers. This
file type shows progressive quality
as the file downloads from a Web site. The image first appears in a low-quality
view and shows higher-resolution views until the image appears at full resolu-
tion when it’s completely downloaded in your browser window.
JPEG 2000 (*.JPF, *.JPX, *.JP2, *. J2K, *.JPC)
JPEG 2000 is a newer JPEG file format. This format offers you the same mode
quality as the JPEG format and an option to save the file with compression
without tossing away pixels, in which case you get lossless compression.
The JPEG 2000 dialog box shows you, right in the dialog box and before you
save the image, the results of the choices you make in terms of the resulting
file size.
61
Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Figure 3-13: When saving in JPEG format, you
make a choice for the amount of compression
to apply to the saved image.

62
Part I: Getting Started 
If you need to save images in JPEG format for your commercial photo lab,
check with the technicians and ask whether they support JPEG 2000. If so,
save your files in this format with a lossless compression. When files are
compressed with lossless compression, you can expect to lose about two-
thirds of the original file size. For example, a 6MB file can be reduced to
about 2MB when it’s saved as JPEG 2000 in a lossless-compression format.
Note that if you save files in JPEG 2000 format for the Web, Web browsers
need to have a plug-in to see the images.
PCX (*.PCX)
PCX is a native PC format first used with PC Paintbrush. Most programs now
support newer file formats, and you’re not likely to need to save in PCX format.
If you have legacy files from years ago, you can open PCX files in Elements,
edit them, and save them in a newer format.
Photoshop PDF (*.PDF, *.PDP)
Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) was designed to maintain document
integrity and exchange files between computers. PDF is one of the most popu-
lar formats and can be viewed in the free Adobe Reader program available for
installation on your Elements CD installer or by downloading it from the
Adobe Web site.
PDF is all over the place in Elements. When you jump into Organize mode and
create slide presentations, cards, and calendars, for example, you can export
your documents as PDF files. When you save in Photoshop PDF format, you
can preserve layers and text. Text is recognizable in Adobe Reader (or other
Acrobat viewers) and can be searched by using the Reader’s Find and Search
tools.
PDF files can be printed, hosted on Web sites, and exchanged with users of
Windows, Macintosh, Unix, and Linux. All in all, this format is well suited for
all the files you create in Elements that contain text, layers, and transparency,
and for when you want to exchange files with users who don’t have Elements
or Photoshop.
Photoshop Raw (*.RAW)
This format is used to exchange files between Windows and Mac users and
mainframe computers. Unless you prepare files to be viewed on mainframes,
don’t bother saving in this format.
PICT File (*.PCT, *.PICT)
PICT (Picture) format is Apple’s answer to PCX on Windows. This format origi-
nated with the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh and the MacDraw program.
PICT files are helpful for creating slides and video files on the Macintosh and
for printing your images on film recorders that don’t use PostScript. You might
use the format when requested by a Mac user or when sending files that need
to be printed as slides on a non-PostScript film recorder.

PNG (*.PNG)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is another format used with Web pages.
PNG supports all color modes, 24-bit images, and transparency. Some
browsers, however, may need a plug-in to see PNG files on Web pages.
One disadvantage of using PNG is that color profiles can’t be embedded in
the images, as they can with JPEG.
Photo Creation Format
The Photo Creation Format is used to save multiple files to a single file
format. Unlike conventional file formats for images that require you to
open individual image files, the Photo Creation Format lets you create up to
30 pages at one time.
TIFF (*.TIF, *.TIFF)
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is the most common format used by graphic
designers. TIFF is generally used for importing images in professional layout
programs like Adobe InDesign and Adobe PageMaker and when commercial
photo labs and print shops use equipment that supports downloading TIFF
files directly to their devices. (Note: Direct downloads are used in lieu of
opening a Print dialog box.)
Inasmuch as creative professionals
have used TIFF for so long, a better
choice for designers using a program
like Adobe InDesign is saving in the
native Photoshop PSD file format.
This requires a creative professional
to save only one file in native format
without bothering to save both
native and TIFF formats.
TIFF, along with Photoshop PSD and
Photoshop PDF, supports saving lay-
ered files and works in all color
modes. When you save in TIFF
format, you can also compress files
in several different compression
schemes, and compression with TIFF
files doesn’t lose data, like it does
with JPEG files.
When you select TIFF for the format
and click Save in the Save/Save As
dialog box, the TIFF Options dialog
box opens, as shown in Figure 3-14.
63
Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Figure 3-14: Choose TIFF from the Format
drop-down menu and click Save to open the
TIFF Options dialog box.

64
Part I: Getting Started 
In the Image Compression area, you have these choices:
 NONE: Selecting this option results in no compression. You use this
option when sending files to creative professionals for creating layouts
in programs like Adobe InDesign. None of the compression schemes
below is recommended for printing files to commercial printing devices.
 LZW: This lossless compression scheme results in much lower file sizes
without destroying data.
 ZIP: ZIP is also a lossless compression scheme. You can favor ZIP compres-
sion over LZW when you have large areas of the same color in an image.
 JPEG: JPEG is lossy and results in the smallest file sizes. Use JPEG here
the same as when you apply JPEG compression with files saved in the
JPEG format.
File formats at a glance
We have been working with Photoshop, which saves in the same formats
listed in this section, since 1989. At no time since then have we used all the
formats available in Photoshop Elements. At most, you’ll use maybe three or
four of these formats.
You don’t need to remember all the formats and what they do. Just pick the
ones you use in your workflow, mark Table 3-3 for reference, and refer to it
from time to time until you have a complete understanding of how files need
to be prepared in order to save them in your desired formats. If you happen
to receive a file from another user in one of the formats you don’t use, come
back to the description in this chapter when you need some detail on what
the format is used for.

Part I: Getting Started 
Audio and video formats supported in Elements
In addition to the image formats listed in Table 3-3, Elements supports audio
and video files. The support is limited to adding and viewing audio and video
files in the Organizer and printing the first frame in a video file. Other kinds
of edits made to audio and video files require special software for audio and
video editing.
Audio files can be imported in slide shows, as we explain in Chapter 15.
The acceptable file formats for audio files are MP3, WAV, QuickTime (Mac),
and WMA. If you have audio files in another format, you need to convert the
file format. For these kinds of conversions, you can search the Internet for a
shareware audio-conversion program.
Video files can also be imported in slide shows, as we discuss in Chapter 15.
Elements supports the WMV (Windows) video format. As with audio files, if
videos are saved in other formats, such as Apple QuickTime (for Windows
users), you need to convert the QT video format to WMV. Mac users can use
QuickTime format. For video-conversion utilities, you can also find shareware
programs to do the job. Search the Internet for a video converter. 

Part II
Getting Organized

In this part . . .
T
he ﬁrst thing you’ll want to do after opening
the Photoshop Elements program is to access
your photos from a digital camera, from your hard
drive, or from your scanner. In this part, we talk
about how to access your pictures and get them
into Elements for editing. We talk about organizing
your pictures by using many impressive organiz-
ing features in the program as well as by searching
for photos and labeling them and then creating
different versions of the same picture. When it
comes to organizing pictures, Elements is one of
the best tools you can ﬁnd to keep your precious
photos neatly cataloged and accessible.

 Scanning photos and artwork
 Importing photos from CDs, DVDs, and other media
 Working with online services
 Acquiring photos from cell phones
 Creating new documents
 Working with Camera Raw files
You have many different sources to work with for getting a picture into
Elements, where you can play with it, experiment on it, and edit it. If you
have a digital camera, you’re in the right place; we walk you through all
kinds of different options for getting the shots you took with
your camera into Elements.
If you have a digital scanner, you’re in the right place,
too! We talk about scanning photos as well. If you have
some CDs, sources of files on the Internet, some mas-
sive collection of images written to a DVD, or even a
picture or two that you took with your cell phone,
you’re still in the right place!
In previous chapters, we flirt with opening files. If you
followed some of the steps in those chapters for
opening images, you should have a feel for using the
Open tool and Open command. But there’s more to
acquiring images than just using the Open command, as
you find out in this chapter.
This chapter covers all you need to know about getting images into Elements
from all kinds of sources. This chapter answers all your questions about how
to move around the workspaces to get your files into Elements.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Digital Cameras versus Scanners 
and Film Cameras
If you don’t have a digital camera, we encourage you to buy one as soon as
you can. Digital cameras and Photoshop Elements were made to work
together. If you’ve spent any time scanning images on a digital scanner, you’ll
appreciate the speed that a camera offers you compared to a scanner when
the time comes to get your images into Elements.
“But I can do more with my scanner than with a digital camera,” you say?
“Not really,” we say. Just for starters, here are some of the benefits you get
with a digital camera:
 Faster access to files: Copying images from a digital camera media card
is much faster than scanning images from prints and film.
 Higher-quality images: Considering the costs of medium- to higher-end
scanners, you can shoot much better pictures with a good-quality SLR
(single lens reflex) camera with a quality lens than you can scan film or
prints with a good-quality consumer-grade scanner.
 OCR and text recognition: Unless you have industrial-strength needs
for scanning reams of text documents that need to be interpreted by
optical character recognition (OCR) software, which converts images to
editable text, you’ll do just fine with a digital camera. If you scan individ-
ual pages on a scanner, shooting pages with a camera is much faster and
can produce the same results when pages need to be converted to text.
 3-D objects: With digital cameras, you can shoot 3-D objects. Try scanning
a pair of shoes — well, maybe some other three-dimensional object —
on a scanner bed sometime. The experiment isn’t worth getting dirt all
over your scanner.
 Reduced costs: With a digital camera, you eliminate film and film-
processing costs. You can order photo prints in superstore outlets, at
less than 10 cents apiece, that are printed on the same photo paper you
get with prints from film. What’s more, you can order prints of only the
pictures you want to keep rather than develop an entire roll to have just
that one good photograph.
 Organizing and archiving: Digital images can be saved to DVD-ROMs,
where you can add information for every image to keep them easily
organized, as we explain in Chapter 5. Searching a DVD is much faster
than searching through photo books of slides, film, or prints. Archiving
digital images is fast and easy, and you don’t need to worry about
scratches, faded colors, or damaged originals.
 Control over image processing: With film, you’re stuck with the pro-
cessing time and temperature that the photo lab uses to process your
film. With some digital cameras, you can post-process images after
shooting the image, as we explain in the last section of this chapter.

 Video clips: Many digital cameras provide a video-shooting mode so
that you can shoot video.
These are some of the benefits you find with using a digital camera over
using a scanner. Scanners do have their place, and some of the benefits you
have with a scanner that you don’t have with cameras involve
 Auto document feeders: You can buy scanners with automatic docu-
ment feeders, where pages of documents can be scanned unattended.
If you need to scan large volumes of pages to recognize text, this opera-
tion is much more practical than using a camera.
 Legacy pictures: You can shoot photo prints with digital cameras and,
depending on the camera, produce images equal to or better than using
a scanner. Filmstrips and slides are easily handled with scanners and
adapters. However, you can also find attachments for your camera that
enable you to shoot slides and negatives. For more information on
shooting slides and negatives with a digital camera, check out Color
Correction For Digital Photographers Only by Ted Padova and Don Mason
(Wiley).
Grabbing Images from Your Camera
Copying photos from your digital camera to your computer so that you can
work with them in Elements is simple if you’re familiar with your camera and
the tools at your disposal. In this section, you find some points to consider
about choosing a resolution when you shoot your pictures as well as how to
use the Microsoft Camera and Scanner Wizard and Adobe Photo Download
Manager after you hook up your camera to your computer.
Choosing a file format
When you work with digital photos in Elements, the file format of your
images is an important point to consider. You choose this format before you
take your pictures, and the format is carried over to your computer when
you pull images off your camera.
The most common file formats that digital cameras offer are JPEG and
Camera Raw. Some cameras offer other options, but these two formats are
the most common. Low-cost point-and-shoot cameras offer you only the JPEG
format, and the more expensive cameras and the SLR types offer you both
JPEG and Camera Raw.
 JPEG: Cameras that produce JPEG images process images with JPEG
compression before saving them. It’s as though your camera performs
a darkroom method of film processing when the shot is taken.
We describe the JPEG file format in Chapter 3.
71
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

72
Part II: Getting Organized 
 Camera Raw: This format provides you with an optimum image for edit-
ing in Elements. When a Camera Raw image is saved to a media source,
all the information the sensor captured is saved with the file. These
images are post-processed when you open them. (See the “Everything
You Want to Know about Camera Raw” section, later in this chapter, to
find out about opening Camera Raw images.) For example, you can open
a Camera Raw image and, before the image opens in Elements, adjust
temperature, exposure, and a bunch of other settings. You can return to
the original Camera Raw file and change the temperature or exposure,
for example, to open the file with different settings. Just like chemical
temperature and development time affect analog film processing, similar
options affect post-processing Camera Raw images. The difference
between analog film and Camera Raw is that after your analog film is
processed, you can’t change the processing attributes. With Camera
Raw, you can go back and post-process the image a hundred times and
change the processing attributes each time.
Camera Raw also supports higher-bit-depth images than JPEG files do.
If you have a choice between just JPEG and both JPEG and Camera Raw,
always choose the latter. You have much more editing control over your
images, and ultimately you get better results.
Using the Microsoft Scanner and 
Camera Wizard (Windows)
Microsoft Scanner and Camera Wizard may automatically be launched when
your computer is connected to a media source. You can use the wizard to
download images from your media source to your computer.
To copy images from a media source or when your camera is connected to
your computer, follow these steps:
1. Hook up the media to your computer.
Connect your computer and your camera or external media reader, or
insert a media source into a port or drive on your computer. The meth-
ods available to you should be detailed in the user’s guide that shipped
with your camera.
When you connect your media to your computer, a dialog box opens,
providing options for how to handle the media.
2. Select Copy Pictures to a Folder on My Computer Using Microsoft
Scanner and Camera Wizard, and click OK.
3. Click Next in the opening pane in the wizard.
You see a pane in which you see thumbnail images of the pictures on
your media source, as shown in Figure 4-1.

Figure 4-1: Click Next to see thumbnails of your images in a scrollable 
window.
4. If you want to copy all images on the media source to your computer,
click Next. If you want selected images copied to your hard drive,
click the Clear All button to remove the check marks below each
thumbnail. After the check marks are removed, select the pictures
you want to copy and click Next.
5. In the next pane in the wizard, browse your hard drive to locate a
folder where you want to copy your pictures. Then click OK.
The images are copied to the target folder.
Using Adobe Photo Download Manager
The Adobe Photo Download Manager (Photo Downloader) is installed with
your Elements program. Photo Downloader acquires images from digital cam-
eras connected to your computer, from card readers, and from card reader
ports on your computer. Photo Downloader is an alternative application to
Microsoft Scanner and Camera Wizard.
To use the Adobe Photo Download Manager:
1. Hook up the media to your computer.
2. Click Cancel in the Microsoft Scanner and Camera Wizard.
73
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

74
Part II: Getting Organized 
Because the wizard auto-launches, the opening pane appears when you
make a connection between your camera media source and your com-
puter. To bail out of the wizard, click Cancel.
3. If you don’t see the download launch automatically, choose Start➪
All Programs➪Adobe➪Adobe Download Manager➪Adobe Download
Manager. 
Alternatively, you can launch Elements and click the View and Organize
button in the Organizer or click the Photo Browser button in either
Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode.
4. Click Advanced in the Adobe Photoshop Elements – Photo Downloader.
5. Select photos to download.
The Photo Downloader program displays thumbnail images, much like
the Microsoft wizard. The Photo Downloader offers a few more options
for acquiring your images, though, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2: The Photo Downloader enables you to suggest photo stacks, make group custom
name tags, and fix red-eye.

6. On the right, follow the steps to identify the source, browse for a loca-
tion folder, add a subfolder if you like, and then rename the files, if
desired.
7. Click the Get Photos button to commence copying files from the
source to your hard drive.
When the photos complete the downloading process, a dialog box opens
and asks whether you want to delete the original photos from your media
source.
8. Click Yes to delete or No to retain the originals.
Immediately after making your selection, the Organizer window opens.
All the photos downloaded to your hard drive appear in a new Organizer
window, as you see in Figure 4-3.
To simplify the process, stick with using one tool to acquire your digital camera
images — either the Microsoft Wizard or the Adobe Photo Download Manager.
Figure 4-3: After downloading is complete, thumbnail images of the copied files appear in a
new Organizer window.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Resizing images from digital cameras
Depending on your camera and the camera settings you use, you may need to
resize your images after you download them.
Camera image resolution, which is measured in megapixels (millions of pixels),
is a factor in image size. If you have a 6-megapixel camera, the full-resolution
images from your camera are about 3000 x 2000 pixels. The file size for a 
6-megapixel image is about 5.7MB.
On the screen, the resolution of all digital camera images is 72 ppi (pixels per
inch). Using the 6-megapixel image as an example, the resolution at 72 ppi
produces an image a little more than 41 x 27 inches. Regardless of whether
your camera takes pictures at 3, 5, or 8 megapixels, the images are all cap-
tured at 72 ppi, but the dimensions vary according to the total number of
pixels captured.
Invariably, you visit the Image Size dialog box, deselect Resample Image,
and edit the resolution text box when you’re preparing images for print.
(See Chapter 3 for more information on using the Image Size dialog box.)
If your color printer requires 150 ppi, changing a 6-megapixel image from
72 ppi at 41 x 27 inches produces an image of a little more than 20 x 13 inches.
Using a Scanner
Scanners connect through the same ports as cameras and card readers.
Unless you have a SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) device, which is
another type of connection port, you use either USB or FireWire. Most low-
end scanners sold now are USB devices.
Even the lowest-end scanners provide 16-bit scans that help you get a little
more data in the shadows and highlights. As with a digital camera, a scan-
ner’s price is normally in proportion with its quality.
Preparing before you scan
Just as you would clean a lens on a digital camera and set various menu
selections before clicking the shutter button, you should prepare a few things
ahead of time before scanning:
 Connect the scanner properly. Make sure that you have all connections
made to your computer according to the user manual that came with
your scanner. If you just purchased a scanner, check for any lock bolts
and remove them according to the instructions.
 Clean the scanner platen. Use a lint-free cloth and some glass cleaner to
remove all dust and particles on the glass. The more dust particles you
remove, the easier job you have of editing your image in Elements.

 Clean the source material. Be certain that the print or film you want to
scan is free from dust and spots.
If you have old negatives that are dirty or that have water spots or debris
that you can’t remove with a cloth and film cleaner, soak the film in photo
flo (a liquid you can purchase at a photo reseller). Be certain that your
hands are clean, and then run the filmstrip between two fingers to remove
the excess liquid. Turn on your shower full force with hot water only and
hang film nearby to dry it. Remove the film when it’s dry and you should
see a surprisingly clean filmstrip compared to your soiled original.
 Get to know your scanner software. When you scan in Elements, the soft-
ware supplied with your scanner takes charge, and you use the options in
this software before it finally drops into an Elements Image window.
 Prepare the artwork. If you plan on scanning pages in a book or pam-
phlet, remove the pages or try to make photocopies so that the piece
you scan lies flat on the scanner platen. Make sure that you observe
copyright laws if you’re scanning printed works. For faxes and photo-
copies, try to improve originals by recopying them on a photocopier
with darker settings.
 Find the scanner’s sweet spot. Every scanner has an area where you can
acquire the best scans. This area is often called the sweet spot. To find
the scanner’s sweet spot, scan a blank piece of paper. The sweet spot
is the brightest area on the resultant scan. Other areas should be darker.
The sweet spot is most often in the upper-left quadrant, the lower-right
quadrant, or the middle of the page. Note the area and plan to place
your source material within this area when scanning pictures.
Understanding image requirements
All scanning software provides you with options for determining resolution
and color mode before you start a new scan. You should decide what output
you intend to use and scan originals at target resolutions designed to accom-
modate a given output. Some considerations include
 Scan the artwork or photo at the size and resolution for the final
output. If you have a 3-x-5 photo that needs to be 1.5 x 2.5 inches on a
Web page, scan the original with a 50 percent reduction in size at 72 ppi.
(See Chapter 3 for information about resizing images.)
 Size images with the scanner software. If you have a 4-x-6 photo that
needs to be output for prepress and commercial printing at 8 x 12 inches,
scan the photo at 4 x 6 inches at 600 ppi (enough to size to 200 percent
for a 300 dpi image).
 Scan properly for line art. Line art is 1-bit black-and-white only.
When you print line art on laser printers or prepare files for commercial
printing, the line art resolution should match the device resolution.
For example, printing to a 600 dpi (dots per inch) laser printer requires
600 ppi for a 1-bit line art image. When you’re printing to an image setter
77
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

78
Part II: Getting Organized 
at a print shop or it’s going directly to plate or press, the resolution
should be 1200 dpi.
 Scan grayscale images in color. In some cases, it doesn’t matter, but
with some images and scanners, you can get better results by scanning
in RGB color and converting to grayscale using the Hue/Saturation
dialog box, as we explain in Chapter 3.
 Scan in high-bit depths. If your scanner is capable of scanning in 16- or 32-
bit, by all means scan at the higher bit depths to capture the most data.
See Chapter 3 for more information about working with higher-bit images.
Using scanner plug-ins
Generally, when you install your scanner software, a stand-alone application
and a plug-in are installed to control the scanning process. Plug-ins are
designed to work inside other software programs, like Photoshop Elements.
When you’re using the plug-in, you can stay right in Elements to do all your
scanning. Here’s how it works:
1. After installing a new scanner and the accompanying software, launch
Elements and then open the Organizer by clicking View and Organize
Photos in the Welcome screen.
2. From the Organizer, open the Preferences dialog box by pressing
Ctrl+K.
3. Click Scanner in the left column and adjust the Scanner preferences,
as we describe in Chapter 2.
When the Preferences dialog box sees your scanner, you know that the con-
nection is properly set up and you’re ready to scan. Here’s how to complete
your scan:
1. To open the scanner software from within Elements, choose File➪Get
Photos➪From Scanner.
(You must be in the Organizer window to access this menu command).
Elements may churn a bit, but eventually your scanner software appears
atop the Organizer window, as you see in Figure 4-4. The window is the
scanner software provided by your scanner manufacturer. (Your window
will look different unless you use the same scanner we use.) Regardless
of which software you use, you should have similar options for creating
a preview; selecting resolution, color mode, and image size; scaling; and
other options.
2. Adjust the options according to your output requirements and recom-
mendations made by your scanner manufacturer.
3. When everything is ready to go, click the Scan button.
The final image drops into an Elements Image window.

Figure 4-4: When you scan from within Elements, your scanner software 
loads on top of the Elements workspace.
Scanning many photos at a time
If you have several photos to scan,
you can lay them out on the
scanner platen and perform a
single scan to acquire all images
in one pass. Arrange the photos to
scan on the glass, and set up all the
options in the scanner window for
your intended output. When you
scan multiple images, they form
a single scan, as you can see in
Figure 4-5.
After you scan multiple images,
Elements makes it easy for you to
separate each image into its own
Image window, where they can be
saved as separate files. Choose
Image➪Divide Scanned Pictures, and
Elements magically opens each
image in a separate window while
your original scan remains intact.
The images are neatly tucked away
in the Photo Bin, where you can
select them for editing, as shown
in Figure 4-6.
79
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
Figure 4-5: You can scan multiple images with
one pass.

80
Part II: Getting Organized 
Figure 4-6: After you choose Image➪Divide Scanned Pictures, the scan is split into separate
Image windows.
Getting Files from Storage Media
When you acquire images in Elements from media sources such as CD-ROMs,
DVDs, external hard drives, and your internal hard drive, the process is very
similar to opening files from digital cameras, which we explain earlier in this
chapter. Insert a CD or DVD into the CD/DVD drive, and the Windows Wizard
opens just like when you insert a media cartridge or connect a cable from
your camera to your computer.
Likewise, you can also open these files in the Organizer. Just cancel out of the
wizard and follow these steps:
1. Open the Organizer window from the Welcome screen or click Photo
Browser from one of the editing modes.
2. When the Organizer window opens, choose File➪Get Photos➪From
Files and Folders.
Alternatively, you can click the Open tool or press Ctrl+O. The Get
Photos from Files and Folders dialog box opens.

3. Open the source drive from the listed drives.
You see the photos stored on the media.
4. Select images and click the Get Photos button to open them in the
Organizer.
Now you can edit them in Elements or save them to your hard drive.
Using Online Services
Online printing and sharing services require you to set up an account with
a service. You can access services provided by Adobe, Kodak, and other
sources from the Preferences dialog box. To use a service, you begin by set-
ting up an account with the Organize and Share Preference settings in the
Organizer, as we explain in Chapter 2.
You can create digital photo albums from your images and share them with
friends, family, and coworkers. To initiate a sharing service, you send an
e-mail invitation to others. Each member of your sharing group needs to set
up an account individually. After everyone has an account, you and your
friends can then order prints that are mailed from the online service center.
All the kinds of prints you might order from a local superstore or photo lab
are available from online services, including specialty items, like calendars.
After setting up an account and adjusting your preferences, you handle shar-
ing services by using the Share Photos drop-down menu on the Shortcuts
bar, as we explain in Chapter 16.
Phoning In Your Images
At first blush, you might get excited by thinking that you can just hook up
your phone to your computer, like you can hook up a digital camera, and
import your camera photos directly in the Organizer. Unfortunately, this 
technology isn’t available to Elements from all cell phones. You can use
Bluetooth connections and USB cables that permit you to copy images to
your hard drive, or you need to e-mail files to yourself and then use the
File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders command.
To get photos from your cell phone, follow these steps:
1. Copy photos from your phone to your computer either through a
cable connection or via e-mail.
You use another utility, not Elements, to copy the pictures. Check your
cell phone manual to find out how to transfer files from your phone to
your computer.
81
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

82
Part II: Getting Organized 
Where Elements comes in is simply to identify the folder where you
copy your mobile phone images.
2. In the Organizer, open the Specify Mobile Phone Folder by choosing
File➪Get Photos➪From Mobile Phone.
The Specify Mobile Phone Folder dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 4-7.
Figure 4-7: Choose File➪Get Photos➪From Mobile Phone in the Organizer.
3. Click Browse and locate the folder where you copied your mobile
phone images.
After you locate the folder, Elements loads all photos in the folder into a
new Organizer window.
4. From the folder, select images to edit and print.
Creating Images from Scratch
You may want to start from scratch by creating a new document in Elements.
New, blank pages have a number of uses. You can mix and merge images in a
new document, as we explain in Chapter 8; create a canvas where you can
draw and paint, as we explain in Chapter 12; or use the New dialog box to get
some feedback on file sizes, dimensions, and resolution.
You can create new, blank documents by using one of several options. 
On the Welcome screen, which appears when you first launch Elements,
click Start from Scratch. The New dialog box opens, in which you choose
the document size, resolution, and other attributes. Likewise, you can create
new files while working in either Full Edit or Standard Edit mode or in the
Organizer.

Here’s how you create a new document while working in any editing mode:
1. Open Elements and select an
editing mode.
Click either Quick Fix Photos or
Edit and Enhance Photos in the
Welcome screen or select View
and Organize Photos to open
the Organizer.
2. Open the New dialog box by
choosing File➪New➪Blank File
in any workspace or pressing
Ctrl+N (or Ô+N on the Mac).
Either way, the New dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 4-8.
3. Select the attributes for the new file.
You have several options from which to choose:
• Name: Type a name for your file.
• Preset: You can select a preset size from a long drop-down list. This
is optional because you can change the file attributes in the other
text boxes and drop-down menus.
• Units: Units come in handy when you want to examine dimensions
in another unit of measure. If, for example, you have digital camera
images at 3000 pixels by 2000 pixels, that number may not mean
much. You can quickly select inches on either the Width or Height
drop-down menu, and the values in the text boxes convert to inches.
• Dimensions: Values in the Width and Height text boxes are indepen-
dent. Either box can be edited without affecting the other.
• Resolution: Resolution here is similar to editing the resolution
value in the Image Size dialog box when the Resample check box is
selected. The resolution is an independent value and isn’t linked
to the dimensions. If you want to know how resolution changes
dimensions without resampling, create a new, blank file at the
known values and click OK. Then choose Image➪Resize➪Image
Size and change the values in the Image Size dialog box, which we
discuss in Chapter 3.
• Color Mode: Your choices are bitmap, grayscale, and RGB. (See
Chapter 3 for more information about color modes.)
• Background Contents: You have three choices: White, Background
Color, and Transparent. The selection you make results in the color
of the blank image. If you choose Background Color, the current
background color assigned on the Tools palette is applied to the
83
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

Part II: Getting Organized 
background. See Chapter 12 for information on changing back-
ground color. If you choose Transparent, the image is created as a
layer, as we explain in Chapter 8.
• Image Size: This value dynamically changes as you change the
Width, Height, and Resolution values. The reported value is how
much file size is required to save the uncompressed file.
4. Click OK after setting the file attributes to create the new document.
In addition to creating new, blank files, the New dialog box can be a helpful
source of information for all your work in Elements. Suppose that you want to
know how many images you can copy to a 128MB USB storage device or how
large your digital camera files will print with a 150 ppi resolution. All you
have to do is press Ctrl/Ô+N to open the New dialog box, plug in the values,
and read the Image Size number or examine the file dimensions. If your files
will be converted to grayscale, choose Grayscale from the Color Mode drop-
down menu and check out the Image Size number to see how much your file
size is reduced. Because this number is dynamic, it changes with each change
you make to the file attributes.
Another means for creating new documents has been introduced in
Photoshop Elements 5. Rather than create a new, blank file, you can add
pages to an existing file in the form of a project. Here’s how to do it:
1. Open an image in Standard Edit mode.
2. Open the Photo Bin by dragging the separator bar up or clicking the
Photo Bin icon in the lower-left corner of the Elements window.
3. Right-click (Windows) or
Ctrl+click (Mac) the photo
thumbnail in the Photo Bin.
The context menu shown in
Figure 4-9 appears.
4. Choose either Add Blank Page
(for adding a new, blank page)
or Add Page Using Current
Layout (to duplicate the cur-
rent photo as a new page).
5. Save the file by choosing
File➪Save As and selecting
Photoshop Multiple Project as
your file format.
All the pages you add to a proj-
ect are saved as separate files in
a folder automatically created
by Elements. When you open
Figure 4-9: Open a context menu and choose
an option for adding a page to the photo
selected in the Photo Bin.

any one of the images, they appear stacked in the Photo Bin. To open
the stack, just click the right-pointing arrow appearing adjacent to the
first image thumbnail. All pages in your project are then displayed in the
Photo Bin. Click any one of the thumbnails to view and edit that page.
In Figure 4-10, you can see thumbnails of a project where the original
RGB image appears on the left followed by a grayscale image, a sepia-
tone image, and a bitmap image — all contained in the same photo 
project.
Figure 4-10: Click the right-pointing arrow to open the project, and click a thumbnail to view
that page in the Image window.
Everything You Want to Know about Camera Raw
We added this more elaborate description of Camera Raw in this part of the
chapter after sharing with you all the other options you have for getting
images in Elements. We recognize that not all of our readers have digital 
cameras capable of capturing Camera Raw images, so it may not be of much
interest to you now.
If you don’t have a camera capable of capturing Camera Raw images, you
might want to look over this section to understand how this file format can
benefit you. When you purchase a camera equipped with Camera Raw sup-
port, you’ll have some understanding of the advantages of using this format.
Understanding Camera Raw
Camera Raw images enable you to post-process your pictures. When you take
a picture with a digital camera in Camera Raw format, the camera’s sensor
records as much information as it can. When you open a Camera Raw file in
Elements, you decide what part of that data is opened as a new image.
Suppose that your camera is set for exposure in tungsten lighting, which is
used with tungsten flash photography in a studio. If you take this camera out-
side in daylight and shoot an image, all your images appear with a blue cast.
This happens because tungsten lighting requires a cooler temperature than
85
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

86
Part II: Getting Organized 
daylight. See Figure 4-14, later in this chapter, for an example of an image
taken outdoors with settings for tungsten lighting.
If you acquire images that are saved in JPEG format, you need to do a lot of
color correction after the image opens in Elements. If you shoot the image in
Camera Raw format, you just process the image with a warmer temperature
(consistent with conditions when the shot was taken), and your color correc-
tion in Elements is a fraction of what it would be to fix a JPEG image.
Post-processing Camera Raw images requires a plug-in that’s installed
with Photoshop Elements. When you open a Camera Raw image, the Camera
Raw plug-in takes over and provides you with a huge set of options for post-
processing the image before you open it in one of the Elements editors.
Acquiring Camera Raw images
If you read through the first part of this chapter, you know how to acquire
images from your camera and copy them to your hard drive. We don’t bother
going through those steps again; we just assume that you have some Camera
Raw images on your hard drive. That’s where you want them, anyway. Opening
files from your hard drive is much faster than working off media cards.
To open a Camera Raw image, follow these steps:
1. Open the image by pressing Ctrl+O (or Ô+O on the Mac) and selecting
it in the Open dialog box.
If you want to select several images in a row, click the first image, hold
down the Shift key, and then click the last image. If you want to select
several nonadjacent images, Ctrl/Ô+click each image.
2. Click Open in the Open dialog box.
If you’re selecting multiple images, only one image appears in the
Camera Raw dialog box. When you click Open, the next image opens in
the Camera Raw dialog box, shown in Figure 4-11.
As you can see, you can use a vast number of options to post-process
your image before you drop it into Elements. This window is like a digital
darkroom, where you can process the film and see what you’re doing to
the image before you accept the changes.
3. Choose from the options to post-process your images.
If you have your monitor properly calibrated, as we explain in Chapter 2,
all the adjustments you make for Camera Raw format are dynamically
updated in the Image preview. Don’t be shy. Poke around and adjust set-
tings to see the results in the preview area. The more you play with the
settings, the more you find out how to get the best out of Camera Raw.

Figure 4-11: Open a Camera Raw image, and the image opens in the Camera Raw plug-in window.
A large number of settings are in the Camera Raw window, as the following
list describes; mark this section to refer to when you work with Camera Raw
images:
 Tools: Five tools appear in the window:
• Zoom: Zooms in and out of the image preview.
• Hand: Moves the image around, like it does in the Elements image
window.
• Eyedropper: Samples color in the image. We cover using the
Elements Eyedropper tools in Chapter 12, and that information
also applies to using the Eyedropper in the Camera Raw window.
• Rotate Left: Appears first.
• Rotate Right: The last tool you see below the Title bar.
(The last two rotation tools are self-explanatory.)
 Image Preview: The Image Preview shows you all the changes you make
before you eventually open the image in an Elements editor.
87
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

88
Part II: Getting Organized 
 Preview: Notice the Adjust and Details tabs. All adjustments you make
on the tabs can be previewed when this check box is selected.
Deselecting the box shows you the image as you first opened it in the
Camera Raw window.
 Shadow/Highlight: The Shadow and Highlight check boxes show clip-
ping in the shadows (dark areas of the image) and highlights (light areas
of the image). Clipping means that, in a certain area, some data and, 
ultimately, detail have been lost in an image. Think of clipping as some-
thing that you don’t want to appear in your pictures. When you make
adjustments with these two check boxes selected, shadow clipping is
shown in blue and highlight clipping is shown in red in the image pre-
view. Take a look at Figure 4-12, in which we exaggerate clipping to show
how the clipping preview appears.
 RGB values: When you first open an image, you don’t see any values in
the RGB area. Click the Zoom tool, the Hand tool, or the Eyedropper
tool, and move the cursor over the image preview. As you move any of
these tools around the image, the RGB values corresponding to the point
below the cursor are reported in this area.
 Histogram: This graph displays all three channels (red, green, and blue)
in an image simultaneously. The histogram changes as you change other
options in the Camera Raw window.
The histogram graphs how pixels in an image are distributed. The distri-
bution includes the number of pixels at each color-intensity level (one of
the 256 levels you find out about in Chapter 3).
If images have pixels concentrated in the shadows, you see the histogram
skewed to the left. Conversely, images with pixels concentrated in the
highlights reveal a histogram skewed to the right.
Figure 4-12: Shadow clipping appears in red, and highlight clipping 
appears in blue.

As you begin to understand histograms more, you can develop your skill
to the point where a quick glance at the histogram provides you with a
clue to what adjustments you need to make to improve images.
 Settings: From this drop-down menu, you have choices for applying 
settings to the open image. If you change any setting, the menu option
changes to Custom. If you previously made settings choices on a Camera
Raw image and you want to return to the shot as it was taken by the
camera, open the image and select Camera Raw Defaults.
Another option you have is Previous Conversion. This selection is handy
if you have a collection of images that all require the same settings. After
adjusting the first image, open additional images and select Previous
Conversion. The Camera Raw plug-in applies the last settings you made
to a Camera Raw image to the current open file.
 Adjust/Detail tabs: In Figure 4-11,
you can see the options on the
Adjust tab. Click the Detail tab
and the options change, as
shown in Figure 4-13. Here, you
have three items to adjust by
either dragging the sliders or
typing values in the text boxes.
Sharpness sharpens images. You
can choose to sharpen images in
the Camera Raw window or in
Elements. Try to avoid sharpen-
ing here and use the sharpening tools in Elements, as we explain in
Chapter 9.
Luminance Smoothing is a noise-reduction tool. You’ve probably seen
images with a lot of noise. In extreme cases, they look like the pictures
were printed on sandpaper. Noise in an image is okay if that’s an effect you
intentionally apply to a picture. However, if you want a smooth-looking
image, you have to eliminate any noise introduced by the camera.
Luminance Smoothing reduces grayscale noise. The next setting is
Color Noise Reduction, which is used to reduce color noise.
 White Balance: White Balance settings are used to adjust the color bal-
ance of an image to reflect the lighting conditions under which the shot
was originally taken. Think of the sensor in a digital camera capable of
capturing the entire range of white balance the sensor can see. You make
a choice not necessarily for what you see, but rather for the white bal-
ance for the shot you took. Therefore, if your camera is set for taking
pictures under one set of lighting conditions and you move to another
set of lighting conditions and forget to change the settings, you can let
the Camera Raw plug-in make a correction for the white balance
because the sensor picked up the entire range and the necessary data
is contained in the file.

In Figure 4-14, you can see a picture taken with the camera set for tung-
sten lighting, but the shot was taken outdoors in daylight. The white 
balance options selected on the Settings drop-down menu are listed in
the figure.
Figure 4-14: From the Settings drop-down menu, you have several choices for white balance.
 Temperature: If one of the preset White Balance options doesn’t quite
do the job, you can move the Temperature slider or edit the text box to
settle on values between one White Balance choice and another. Use this
item to fine-tune the White Balance.
 Tint: Tint is another fine-tuning adjustment affected by White Balance.
This slider and text box are used to correct any green or magenta tints
that might appear in a photo.
Auto
Daylight
Cloudy
Tungsten
Fluorescent
Flash
Shade

 Brightness adjustments: Several adjustment sliders and text boxes help
you control the image brightness and tonal range. Notice the Exposure
setting. This item lets you correct photos taken at the wrong exposure.
In analog darkrooms, you might ask technicians to push or pull film
during processing, which results in longer and shorter processing times.
Changing exposure times compensates for under- and overexposing film.
A nice advantage of using Camera Raw is that you can change the exposure
for one image and then later open the original raw image and change to
a different exposure value. Analog film can’t be reprocessed, but with
Camera Raw, you can reprocess over and over again.
Other options for the brightness and tonal controls are similar to the
choices you have in the Elements Standard Editing mode. For more 
information on these adjustments, see Chapter 10.
 Cancel/Reset: When you open the Camera Raw window, the button you
see by default is Cancel. Press the Alt key, and the button changes to
Reset. If you want to scrub all the settings you made and start over,
press Alt and click Reset.
 Open/Update/Skip: This single button has three different purposes:
• Open: This button is the default. Click Open after you choose all
your settings to process the photo and open it in Elements.
• Update: Press the Alt/Option key, and the button changes to
Update. If you click Update and then cancel out of the dialog box,
the next time you open the file in the Camera Raw window, you
seethe changes you made before the Update button was clicked.
This action lets you change a bunch of settings on several images
that you intend to open and edit later in Elements.
• Skip: Press the Shift key to see this button. If you open several
images at a time, press Shift, and click Skip, the current active
window is dismissed and you move to the next document.
 Save: Clicking Save merely saves your current settings. You can eliminate
the settings saved with the file by selecting Camera Raw Defaults in the
Settings drop-down menu.
 Help: Clicking this button opens a Help document to assist you in under-
standing more about Camera Raw.
 Bit Depth: If your camera is capable of shooting higher bit depths,
they’re listed here. If you want to convert to 8-bit images for printing,
you can select the option from the drop-down menu.
 Zoom: From this drop-down menu, you can choose from several zoom
presets. You can also edit the text box or click the minus (–) button to
zoom out or the plus (+) button to zoom in. Using any option zooms the
Image preview.

In This Chapter
 Viewing photos in the Organizer
 Navigating the Image window
 Sorting photos
 Searching for photos
T
he Organizer is a powerful tool that helps you locate files and keeps your
photos arranged and organized. You can easily access the Organizer by
clicking the Photo Browser button on the Shortcuts bar while you’re in one of
the editing modes. Or, when you open the Welcome screen, click the View
and Organize Photos button.
In this chapter, you discover how to view and organize your pictures in
the Organizer and the Image window and how the many options
help speed up your work in Photoshop Elements.
The Many Faces of the Organizer
The default Organizer view is like a slide sorter, and
this view is one you’re likely to use in all your
Elements work sessions. The Organizer makes
accessing photos an efficient means for opening a
picture in one of the editors. Just double-click a
photo in the Organizer, and you see the image zoom in
size to fill an Organizer window. You can carefully exam-
ine the photo to be certain that it’s the one you want and
then just select which editor you want to use from the Edit
drop-down list on the Shortcuts bar or from the top-level
Edit menu.

94
Part II: Getting Organized 
In addition to the default view in the Organizer, you have some other oppor-
tunities for examining your pictures. You can view pictures in a slide show, or
you can view pictures side-by-side to compare them.
Adding files to the default Organizer view
Before you explore alternative viewing options in the Organizer, take a look
at how you add photos to the thumbnail images you see in the Organizer
window.
After copying the photos to your hard drive, as we explain in Chapter 4,
here’s how you go about adding those files to an existing group of images in
the Organizer:
1. View photos to add to the Organizer window.
Be certain that you have photos in the Organizer window.
2. In the Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.
The Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1: The Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box.

3. In the Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box, choose
Thumbnails from the View menu (the icon with the down arrow, to
the far right of the Look In drop-down list).
In Thumbnails view, thumbnail images of most of your files appear in a
scrollable window. (Note: You might not see Camera Raw files and some
files saved in different formats.) This view makes it easy to locate the
files you want to add to the Organizer.
4. Select files to add to the Organizer window.
Click a thumbnail and use either the Shift key or the Ctrl/Ô key to select
additional photos. When you hold down Shift and click, all photos
between the first thumbnail and the thumbnail you Shift+click are
selected. When you Ctrl/Ô+click, you can select a series of noncontigu-
ous photos.
5. Click Get Photos to add the selected photos to the Organizer window.
6. Add the new photos to the Organizer window you originally opened
by clicking the Back button on the Shortcuts bar.
The photos you add to the Organizer may appear out of order when
you’re viewing the Organizer. Depending on the sort order, which we
explain later in this chapter, the additional photos you added to the
Organizer can appear before or after or integrated within the original
photos. Use the scroll bar in the Organizer to view the added photos.
Viewing photos in a slideshow (Full Screen view)
Are you ready for some exciting viewing in Photoshop Elements? To take an
alternative view of your Organizer files, you can see your pictures in a self-
running slide show (in Full Screen view), complete with transition effects and
background music. Full Screen view takes you to a slide show view. For the
purposes of clarity, think of Full Screen view and viewing a slide show as the
same thing. Full-screen viewing temporarily hides the Elements tools and
menus and gives you the most viewing area on your monitor to see your 
pictures.
Viewing files in slide show mode can be helpful for quickly previewing
the files you want to edit for all kinds of output as well as for previewing
photos that you might use for an exported slide show, which we explain in
Chapter 15.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Setting up your images for viewing
To set up your slide show and/or enter Full Screen view, follow these steps:
1. Click the Photo Browser button to open the Organizer and navigate to
a folder of images you want to view.
2. Select individual images to see in a slide show, or use all the images in
the Organizer for your slide show.
If no images are selected when you enter Full Screen view, all photos in
the Organizer window are shown in Full Screen view.
3. Choose View➪View Photos in Full Screen.
The Full Screen View Options dialog box, shown in Figure 5-2, opens.
Figure 5-2: Choose View➪View Photos in Full Screen to open the Full Screen 
View Options dialog box, where full-screen viewing options are selected.
4. Choose the options for your slide show in the dialog box.
The Full Screen View Options dialog box offers a number of choices for
viewing a slide show in Full Screen view. Table 5-1 explains each option.
5. After you determine the attributes for full-screen viewing, click OK.
You enter full-screen mode. For a moment, the Full Screen View toolbar
appears at the top of the window. This toolbar hides automatically after
a few seconds. We explain in Table 5-1 how, if you select the Show
Filmstrip check box, Full Screen view appears, as shown in Figure 5-3.

Figure 5-3: When Show Filmstrip is selected, the full-screen view shows, on the right side of
the Image window, thumbnail images of the files selected for viewing.

Moving Around the Image Window
When you edit images in either Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode, you continu-
ally interact with the Image window. Whether you’re zooming in and out of a
single window or viewing multiple windows, you need to work comfortably
in this area for all your editing tasks. To help you move around the Image
window, Elements provides a rich set of tools. If you become familiar with the
many viewing options and keyboard shortcuts available in Elements, all your
editing jobs will be much easier. The tools, menu commands, and palettes
described in this section are essential for just about everything you do in
Elements.
Zooming in and out of images
Zooming in and out of images is a task you perform routinely while editing
images in the Image window and also when working in other windows, such
as the Camera Raw window and the Full Screen View window. Zooming in is
necessary when you want to precisely edit a section of an image or examine
detail in a small area. You then need to zoom out to see the edits as they com-
pare to the entire image.

Zoom by clicking
The Zoom tool appears on the Tools palette. To use the tool for zooming in
and out, take a look at how it all works:
1. Click the Zoom tool on the Tools palette to select it (or simply press Z).
2. Move the cursor, now loaded with the Zoom tool, to the Image
window and click the place where you want to zoom.
To zoom in more, click again; keep clicking until you zoom in far enough.
3. To zoom out of an image, keep the Zoom tool selected, hold down the
Alt/Option key, and click.
The cursor changes to a magnifying glass tool with a minus (–) symbol
when you hold down the Alt/Option key.
Zoom to a selection
Another way to change a view is to zoom to a target area in an image.
Here’s how:
1. Click the Zoom tool on the Tools palette.
2. Drag a box around the area you want to zoom.
A dashed rectangle marquee appears, as shown in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6: Click the Zoom tool on the Tools palette and drag around an area you want to zoom.
101
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images

102
Part II: Getting Organized 
3. Move the rectangle marquee if you need to adjust the selection.
Now it’s time to get fancy. If you have a marquee drawn with the Zoom
tool and the size appears just right but you want to move just the rectan-
gle, press the spacebar while you keep the mouse button pressed.
You can drag the marquee rectangle anywhere in the image to zoom
to the area defined by the rectangle boundary.
4. Release the mouse button.
The view zooms to fit the space defined by the marquee rectangle.
Using the Options bar
Above the Image window and below the Shortcuts bar you find the Options
bar. The Options bar is ever-changing, offering different options as you select
different tools on the Tools palette. When you click the Zoom tool, the Options
bar changes, as shown in Figure 5-7. You have many similar choices for zoom-
ing in and out of images and a few options unique to the Options bar:
Figure 5-7: Click the Zoom tool on the Tools palette, and the Options bar changes to reflect choices for
zooming in and out of images.
a Zoom In/Zoom Out tools: You can choose Zoom In or Zoom Out as sepa-
rate tools to avoid using the Alt/Option key to toggle between the two.
b Zoom percentage: This figure shows you the current zoom level as a
percentage. You can edit the text by typing values between 1 and 1600.
c Zoom slider: Click the right-pointing arrow, and a slider bar opens.
Drag the slider left to zoom out or right to zoom in.
d Resize Windows To Fit: Select this check box to resize the window along
with the image zoom. Deselect the box to zoom in and out of an image
while the Image window remains at a fixed size.
e Ignore Palettes: This check box is selected when you select the Resize
Windows to Fit check box. Selecting this box ignores palettes when
you’re using the Zoom tool, so you can zoom to an area covered by the
palettes. If you deselect the box, you can’t zoom to an area beneath the
Palette Bin.

f Zoom All Windows: If you have multiple images open and select this
check box, zooming with the Zoom tool zooms all open documents
simultaneously.
g Actual Pixels/Fit Screen/Print Size: The same options are available as
discussed earlier in this chapter, in the “Working with the toolbar” 
section.
Viewing multiple documents
When you need to view two or more images at one time, choose Window➪
Images to open a submenu of viewing options used for viewing multiple files.
The Window menu also provides a list of all your open documents. Here’s a
list of options you find on the submenu:
 Maximize Mode: In Maximize mode, you see only one Image window and
lose the option for resizing the window by dragging the lower-right
corner in or out. If you want to bring back the title bar and the resizing
options, choose the Window➪Images➪Maximize Mode command again.
Notice the Maximize Mode check box; click it to remove the check mark
on the submenu and minimize the Image window.
 Tile: Tiling images reduces Image window sizes to a size that accommo-
dates viewing all images in scrollable windows within the Elements
workspace. Choose Window➪Images➪Tile when multiple images are
open to get a view similar to the one shown to Figure 5-8.
 Cascade: Choose Window➪Images➪Cascade, and the Image windows
overlap each other in a cascading view.
 Match Zoom: Set the zoom level for one of several images open in
Elements and choose Window➪Images➪Match Zoom. All open docu-
ments are zoomed to the same level as the foreground image.
 Match Location: If you zoom into, for example, the upper-right corner
and then select Match Location, all open images zoom to the same loca-
tion in the respective photos.
 Bring Image to Foreground: As you open photos, the open documents
are listed by name on the Window menu. The active document is the
foreground image. If you want to edit another image, choose Window
and select the image you want to edit. That image comes to the fore-
ground as the active image.
Although you can use a menu command to bring images to the fore-
ground and make them active, you can perform the same action by 
clicking an image thumbnail in the Photo Bin.
103
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images

104
Part II: Getting Organized 
Figure 5-8: Open several images in one of the editing modes and choose Window➪Images➪Tile to show all
Image windows.
Using Pan and Zoom
When you zoom in on a document larger than the Image window can accom-
modate, scroll bars provide a means for moving the image inside the window.
Moving the image around a window is panning the image.
You can also use the Hand tool to pan the image. Zoom into an image and
click the Hand tool. Click and drag the image around the window. If you
want to zoom in or out while the Hand tool is selected, hold down the 
Ctrl/Ô key, and the Hand tool temporarily changes to the Zoom In tool.
Hold down Ctrl+Alt (or Ô+Option) and the Hand tool temporarily changes to
the Zoom Out tool.

Using the Navigator palette
The Navigator palette affords you several different options for both zooming
and panning an image.
To open the Navigator palette,
choose Window➪Navigator.
The Navigator palette, shown in
Figure 5-9, opens as a floating
palette in the Elements workspace.
(For more information on floating
palettes, see Chapter 1.)
While you select options for zooming
on the Navigator palette, the image
preview in the Palette window stays
fixed to show you the entire image.
As you zoom in and out inside the
palette, the corresponding zoom is
applied to the active document.
Either use the zoom tools on the
palette or drag the slider left and
right to zoom in and out. If you place the cursor inside the image preview
thumbnail, you can drag a rectangle and zoom into the image.
Using the Navigator palette can be particularly helpful if you use two moni-
tors. Just drag the Navigator palette to your second monitor, where you can
change zoom levels without having the palette obscure the background
image.
Sorting Your Photos
With all the Photoshop Elements modes and workspaces, you need a consis-
tent starting place to handle all your editing tasks. Think of the Organizer as
Grand Central Station, and from this central location you can take the Long
Island Railroad to any destination you desire. In Elements terms, rather than
head out to Port Washington, you travel to an editing mode. Rather than go
to the Hamptons, you journey through all the creation areas. In short, the
Organizer is the central depot on the Photoshop Elements map.
105
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
Figure 5-9: The Navigator palette.

106
Part II: Getting Organized 
In addition to being a tool to navigate to other workspaces, the Organizer is a
management tool you can use to organize, sort, search, and describe photos
with identity information. In terms of sorting and organizing files, Elements
provides many different options, and we cover them all in the following 
sections.
Using sort commands
In the lower-left corner of the Organizer window is
a pop-up menu that provides some sorting
options, as shown in Figure 5-10. Alternatively,
you can choose View➪Arrangement, and a sub-
menu providing the same commands opens.
The sorting options available to you are
 Date (Newest First): Select this option to view images according to the
date you took the photos, beginning with the most recent date.
 Date (Oldest First): This option displays photos in chronological order,
starting with the oldest file.
 Import Batch: You might import a batch of photos in one Photoshop
Elements session and import another batch in the same session or in
another session. When you select Import Batch, the images appear 
organized in groups, according to the date the batch was created.
In Figure 5-11, you can see several batches imported and added as 
collections, which we describe in Chapter 6.
 Folder Location: Click Folder Location and you see an Explorer pane on
the left side of the Organizer window. You can browse your hard drive
for folder locations and select a folder containing images you imported
into the Organizer.
Sorting media types
Photos can also be sorted according to media type. Elements supports view-
ing photos, video files, audio files, creations, and PDF files. To select different
media types, choose View➪Media Types, and the Items Shown dialog box
opens. Check the boxes for the media types you want to display in the
Organizer window.
Figure 5-10: The Organizer’s
sort options.

Figure 5-11: When you’re importing photos in batches, you can sort files according to batch-import dates.
Using Search Options
The Organizer’s Find menu is devoted entirely to searching photos. From the
Find menu, you can locate photos in collections, catalogs, and the Organizer
window according to a variety of different search criteria.
To use the commands on the Find menu, you need to have photos loaded in
the Organizer window or create collections or catalogs, which we explain in
Chapter 6. The categories in the following sections can be searched in the
Organizer.
Searching by date
When you have a number of different files in an Organizer window from
photos shot on different dates, you can narrow your search to find photos,
and all other types of files supported by Elements, through a date search.
To search files by date, do the following:
107
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images

108
Part II: Getting Organized 
1. Open files in the Organizer by choosing File➪Get Photos and then
choosing a submenu command for acquiring files.
To open files stored on your hard drive, choose the From Files and
Folders submenu command.
2. Select a date range by choosing
Find➪Set Date Range.
The Set Date Range dialog box,
shown in Figure 5-12, opens.
3. Specify the dates.
Type a year in the Start Date
Year text box. Select the month
and day from the Month and
Day drop-down lists. Repeat the
same selections for the end date.
4. Click OK.
The thumbnails shown in the Organizer window include only files cre-
ated within the specified date range.
Searching for untagged items
You can tag files with a number of different criteria, as we explain in Chapter 6.
When tags are added to images, you can sort files according to tag labels. We
cover sorting by tag labels in Chapter 6, too. For now, take a look at the Find
menu and notice the Untagged Items command. If you haven’t added tags 
to some items and you want to show only the untagged files so that you 
can begin to add tags, choose Find➪Untagged Items or press Ctrl+Shift+Q.
Elements displays all files without tags in the Organizer window.
Searching collections
Collections are among many items we address in Chapter 6. You can create
collections and then select a collection on the Collections palette. Selecting
a collection is like having a first level of sorting. You can then search by date
or other sort options discussed here to narrow the choices.
Searching captions and notes
In Chapter 6, we talk about adding captions and notes to your files. When
captions or notes are added to files, you can search on the caption name,
contents of a note, or both. To search caption names and notes, do the 
following:
Figure 5-12: Open the Set Date Range dialog
box and specify the start and end dates.

1. Open files in the Organizer by choosing File➪Get Photos and then
choosing a submenu command for acquiring files.
If you’re opening files stored on your hard drive, choose the From Files
and Folders submenu command.
2. Choose Find➪By Caption
or Note.
The Find by Caption or Note
dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 5-13.
Options in the dialog box are
• Find Items with Caption or
Note: In the text box, type
the words you want to
search.
• Match Only the Beginning
of Words in Captions and Notes: Click this radio button when you
know that your caption or note begins with words you type in the
text box.
• Match Any Part of Any Word in Captions or Notes: Click this radio
button if you’re not sure whether the text typed in the box is used
at the beginning of a caption or note or whether it’s contained
within the caption name or note text.
3. Click OK.
The Results appear in the Organizer window.
Searching by history
Elements keeps track of what you do with your photos, such as printing,
e-mailing, sharing, and performing a number of other tasks. You can search
for files based on the file history by choosing Find➪By History. Selecting
options on the By History submenu reports files found on date searches
meeting the history criteria.
Searching metadata
Metadata includes both information about your images that is supplied by
digital cameras and custom data you add to a file. Metadata contains descrip-
tions of the image, such as your camera name, the camera settings you used
to take a picture, copyright information, and much more.

to open the dialog box in which search criteria
for captions and notes are specified.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Searching metadata is easy. Just choose Find➪By Details (Metadata) in
the Organizer. The Find by Details (Metadata) dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 5-14. The first two columns in the dialog box offer a number of differ-
ent choices for search criteria and options according to the criteria. In the
third column, you specify exactly what you want to search by typing search
criteria in the text box. Clicking the plus button adds new lines to add more
criteria to the search, and clicking the minus button deletes a line. 
Figure 5-14: Choose Find➪By Details (Metadata) in the Organizer to 
open the dialog box in which metadata are specified.
Searching faces
If a magical method is available to you for searching files in Elements, it has
to be searching for faces. When you choose Find➪Find Faces for Tagging,
Elements searches through files you select in the Organizer window and
examines each image for a face — Homo sapiens faces, to be exact.
Note that you should first select image thumbnails in the Organizer window
and then choose Find➪Find Faces for Tagging. If you don’t select files,
Elements searches the entire catalog. Be aware that if you search through
a large catalog, Elements takes some time to complete the search.
The results of the search magically include all photos containing faces in a
new Organizer window. Although the command is intended to identify images
you can tag, you can use the command for invoking a search and choose to
view all files containing faces.

D
ownloading a bunch of media cards filled with photos and
leaving them in folders distributed all over your hard
drive is like having a messy office with papers stacked all
over your desk. Trying to find a file, even with all the
great search capabilities we cover in Chapter 5, can
take you as much time as sorting through piles of
papers. What you need is a good file-management
system.
In this chapter, we talk about organizing and anno-
tating files and the important task of backing up 
files. Be certain to take a little time to understand the
organization methods that Elements provides and keep
your files organized as you copy them to your hard drive
and back up files to CD-ROMs or DVDs. The time you invest
in organizing your pictures helps you quickly locate files when
you need them.

112
Part II: Getting Organized 
Organizing Groups of Images with Collections
Elements provides you with a great opportunity for organizing files, in the
form of collections. After you acquire your images in the Organizer, as we 
discuss in Chapter 4, you should sort them out and add them to some perma-
nent collections according to the dates you took the pictures, the subject
matter, or some other categorical arrangement.
In the Organizer window, two palettes help you sort your pictures and keep
them well organized. You use the Tags palette, which we talk about in the sec-
tion “Tag — You’re It!” later in this chapter, to identify individual images by
using a limitless number of options for categorizing your pictures. On the
Collections palette, you can create collections and collection groups to neatly
organize files.
Collections are handy when you want to use the many different creation
options we explain in Chapter 16. You create a collection from files stored in
various folders on your hard drive and preview the images to be used in a
creation. Select the images you want to use in creating slide shows and photo
albums, for example. When you finish with the creations, go back and delete
the collection.
In the following sections, you find out how to create and manage collections.
Creating a new collection
To create a new collection and add photos to the collection, do the following:
1. Open photos in the Organizer.
Open the Organizer window by clicking the Photo Browser button in an
editing mode or selecting View and Organize
Photos on the Welcome screen. Choose
File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.
Note that you should have copied some
photos to your hard drive, as we explain in
Chapter 4.
2. If you don’t see the Collections tab in the
Organize Bin, choose Window➪Organize
Bin.
By default, the Organize Bin should be open
to the Collections tab.
3. To create a new Collection, choose New➪
New Collection on the Collections tab.
The Edit Collection dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1: The Edit Collection
dialog box.

4. Type a name for the collection in the Name text box, and add a note to
describe the collection.
You might use the location where you took the photos, the subject
matter, or other descriptive information.
5. Click OK in the Edit Collection dialog box.
You return to the Organizer window.
6. In the Organizer window, select the photos you want to add to your
collection.
Click a photo and Shift+click another photo to select photos in a group.
Click a photo and Ctrl+click different photos scattered around the
Organizer window to select photos in a nonconsecutive order.
7. To add the selected photos to the new collection, click one of the
selected photos in the Organizer window
and drag the photo thumbnail to the New
Collection icon in the Organize Bin.
When you release the mouse button, the
photos are added to the new collection.
8. Repeat Steps 3 through 7 to create collec-
tions for all the images you want to organize.
9. To view one or more collections, click the
empty squares adjacent to a collection icon
to show the photos within that collection in
the Organizer window.
When you click the empty square, an icon in
the shape of a pair of binoculars appears
inside the square, as shown in Figure 6-2.
Working with collections
You can manage collections by using menu commands from the New drop-
down menu and other commands from a context menu that you open by
right-clicking a collection on the Collections tab.
From the New drop-down menu, you have these commands:
 New Collection: Create a new collection, as described in the steps in the
preceding section.
 New Collection Group: You can group several collections in a collection
group and share your files with a sharing service. Select multiple col-
lections and click the New button in the Collections palette. From the
drop-down menu, select New Collection Group to open the Create
Collection Group dialog box.
113
Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Figure 6-2: Click the empty
square adjacent to the
collection icon.

114
Part II: Getting Organized 
 Save Collections to a File: You can save collections to a file that can be
retrieved using the From File command. This option is handy when you
open a different catalog file and you want to import the same collection
names created in one catalog file to another catalog file. (See the section
“Cataloging Files,” later in this chapter.)
 From File: Import a saved collection.
Right-click the mouse button on a collection name, and the following menu
commands appear:
 Edit <collection name> Collection: Choose Edit <Collection Name>
Collection, and the Edit Collection dialog box opens (refer to Figure 6-1).
You can use this command to rename a collection or change the note.
Alternatively, you can click the Pencil tool on the palette to open the
same dialog box.
 Delete <collection name> Collection: Select a collection and click this
menu option to delete a collection. Alternatively, click the Trash icon on
the palette to delete a collection. Note that deleting a collection doesn’t
delete files.
 Find Items in <collection name> Collection: Opening a context menu
on a collection that’s not visible in the Organizer window and choosing
this command is the same as clicking the empty square adjacent to a
collection icon. All the photos in the collection appear in the Organizer
window.
 Add <number selected > Items to <collection name> Collection: If you
select one photo in the organizer, the number is one. Selecting more
than one photo changes the number to the total number of selected
images. When you open a context menu, the selected images are added
to the collection where the context menu is opened.
Collections are automatically saved with the catalog you work with. By default,
Elements creates a catalog and auto-saves your work to it. If you happen to
create another catalog, as we explain in the next section, your collections 
disappear. You need to be aware of which catalog is open when you create
collections in order to return to them.
Cataloging Files
As you open files in the Organizer, all your files are automatically saved to a
catalog. The files themselves aren’t really saved to the catalog, but rather
links from the catalog to the individual files are saved. Links are like pointers
that tell the catalog where to look for a file. As you add and delete files, the
catalog is continually updated.

As you open more files in the Organizer, the default catalog file grows, and
the maximum size of the catalog file is limited only by your available hard
drive space. Working with a single catalog file has some disadvantages.
For example, if your catalog file becomes corrupted and unrecoverable, you
lose all the work you’ve done organizing files into collections. If you work
with many files, the Organizer performance slows down.
Rather than work with a single catalog file, you can fine-tune your file organiza-
tion by creating several catalogs. You might want to organize files according
to subject matter, dates, locations, or some other division of categories and
create separate catalogs for each category. You find all the details in the sec-
tions that follow.
Splitting a big catalog into smaller catalogs
Here’s how you go about breaking up a large catalog into a smaller one:
1. Open files in the Organizer.
If you have a large collection of files (100 images or more) open in an
Organizer window, you can start with your open files. If you don’t yet have
files open, choose the File➪Get Photos menu command and get photos
from one of the submenu commands to load up the Organizer window.
2. Open the Catalog dialog box,
shown in Figure 6-3, by choos-
ing File➪Catalog.
Here’s something to keep in
mind when working with cata-
logs: You don’t create or access
catalogs by using menu com-
mands. All the aspects of 
working with a catalog are han-
dled in the Catalog dialog box.
3. Duplicate the catalog file by
clicking the Save As button in
the Catalog dialog box.
The Save Catalog As dialog box opens. By using Save As, you duplicate
the current Organizer window and save it as a new catalog file.
4. Type a descriptive name for the catalog in the File Name text box and
click OK.
When you’re done, you return to the Organizer window.
5. Add and delete files in the Organizer.
You can delete files that don’t belong to your newly created catalog
topic and add files by choosing the File➪Get Photos menu command.
115
Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Figure 6-3: Choose File➪Catalog to open the
Catalog dialog box.

116
Part II: Getting Organized 
Furthermore, you can add or delete collections, as described in the pre-
ceding section in this chapter. The view you create in the Organizer is
automatically saved to your new catalog file.
When you delete a file from a catalog, Elements prompts you in a dialog
box to confirm the deletion. Also in the dialog box is a check box for
deleting files from your hard disk. If you click the box, the file is deleted
from your hard disk. Be certain to exercise caution so that you don’t
inadvertently delete your only copy of a photo.
Importing photos to a new catalog
To keep your photos organized and your catalog files smaller, you can start a
completely new catalog before you import photos. Follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Catalog and click New in the Catalog dialog box.
2. When the New Catalog dialog box opens, type a name for the new cat-
alog in the File Name text box and click Save.
3. If you want to add free music files installed with Elements, click the
check box for Import Free Music into All New Catalogs.
4. You can choose the File➪Get Photos menu commands to add files to
the new catalog.
When the Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, a list of
media files appears in the dialog box when the Import Free Music into
All New Catalogs check box is selected. You can select the free music
files to add to your collection; then navigate your hard drive and select
the photos you want to add. After you identify all the files, click Open;
the selected music files and photos are added to your new collection.
Switching to a different catalog
When you need to open a different catalog file, choose File➪Catalog and click
Open. All your catalogs appear in the default folder where the catalogs are
saved. Select a catalog and click Open, and the Organizer window changes to
reflect files contained in the respective catalog.
Notice the Recover button in Figure 6-3. If you can’t see thumbnail previews
of images or open them in one of the editing modes, your catalog file might
be corrupted. Click the Recover button to try to fix the problem.
Tag — You’re It!
If you want to sort files into subcategories, Elements provides tags for identi-
fying common files.

Think of a catalog as a parent item and collections as its children. Within collec-
tions, you can sort files according to date by using the sort options discussed
in Chapter 5. If you still have a number of files in an Organizer window that
are hard to manage, you can create tags that form subcategories within the
collections. These tags can be
 Ratings, such as one to five stars, you assign to files in the Favorites area
of the Tags palette
 Groups, like family, friends, and places
 Other custom categories you want to define by tagging files with these
items
After creating tags and applying the tags to files in a catalog, clicking the box
adjacent to a tag name on the Tags palette in the Organize Bin shows you all
files assigned to the given tag. You can further sort the tagged files according
to date, as described in Chapter 5.
Tags are handled with menu commands from the New drop-down menu on
the Tags palette that’s shown when you’re working in the Organizer window.
Click the Tags tab in the Organize Bin and click the down arrow adjacent
to the New button to open the menu. These menu options are associated
with tags:
 New Tag: Choose this menu command to open the Create Tag dialog
box, where new tags are added to the Tags palette.
 New Subcategory: Choose this menu command to create a new 
subcategory.
 New Category: Choose this menu command to create a new tag 
category.
 From File: Choose this menu command to load tags that were saved
using the Save Tags to File command.
 Save Tags to File: Choose this menu command to save tags to an XML
(eXtensible Markup Language) file. XML files can be exported and
imported in various ways in Elements, such as when you’re using 
collections and tags. You can then open a different catalog and use the
From File command so that all the new tags created in another catalog
are imported into the current open catalog. This feature can save you a
lot of time organizing files.
Suppose that you’re a wedding photographer and you create catalogs
for each individual wedding you shoot. (If you combine a few weddings
in one catalog, you can create separate collections for each individual
wedding.) You can create tags for the pre-ceremony shots of the bride
dressing and the groom dressing, another set of tags for the ceremony,
and another set of tags for the reception. After you create your first 
117
Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos

118
Part II: Getting Organized 
catalog and identify the tags, export the file by using the Save Tags to
File command. Each time you shoot a new wedding, you load the tags
into a new catalog file by using the From File menu command.
Creating new tags
New tags can be added as subsets to existing tags. You can create new tags,
add icons for the appearance of tags, and assign tags to selected files in a cat-
alog file. Here’s how you go about creating tags:
1. Choose File➪Catalog and open a catalog
you created for a particular category.
If you haven’t created a catalog, use files you
open in the Organizer window.
2. On the Tags tab in the Organize Bin,
choose New➪New Tag.
The Create Tag dialog box opens.
3. To add an icon appearance, click the Edit
Icon button.
The icon you add appears on the Tags palette
to help you easily identify tags. The Edit Tag
Icon dialog box, shown in Figure 6-4, opens.
4. Click the Import button.
The Import Image for Tag Icon dialog box
opens.
5. Locate an image you want to use, select it,
and click Open.
You can use any photo saved in .jpg, .bmp, .png, or .gif format.
(See Chapter 3 for more information on file formats.) When the image
is imported, an image preview is displayed in the dialog box (refer to
Figure 6-5).
6. Locate the place on a map where you shot the photo. Then click the
Place on Map button in the Create Tag dialog box.
The Tag Location on Map dialog box opens. 
7. Type a location in the dialog box, such as city and country or city and
state. Click the Find button and the Look Up Address dialog opens
with a location listed. Click OK.
You return to the Edit Tag Icon dialog box with a Yahoo map showing the
location you specified as shown in Figure 6-5.
Figure 6-4: Click Edit Icon in the
Create Tag dialog box to open
the Edit Tag Icon dialog box.

Figure 6-5: The Create Tag dialog box with an identified map location.
8. The Category drop-down list identifies all the categories now on the
Tags palette. Select the category where you want your new tag to
appear as a child to the category.
9. Type a name for your tag in the Name text box.
10. Add a note to describe the tag and then click OK.
Your new tag is added to the Tags palette.
Creating new categories
In the Create Tag dialog box, the categories in the Category drop-down menu
come from the category list on the Tags palette. If you want to use a category
not available among the default tags, you can create your own new custom
category by following these steps:
1. Choose File➪Catalog and open a catalog you created for a particular
category.
If you haven’t created a catalog, use files you open in the Organizer
window.
119
Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos

120
Part II: Getting Organized 
2. On the Tags palette, choose New➪New
Category.
The Create Category dialog box, shown in
Figure 6-6, opens.
3. Click the Choose Color button in the Create
Category dialog box and select a color
from the color palette that opens.
4. Type a name for the category in the
Category Name text box.
5. Select an icon in the Category Icon list by
clicking it.
You can scroll the list of icons by dragging the slider bar back and forth
or click the left and right arrows. All icons you can assign to a category
are available from this list. Elements doesn’t provide an option for creat-
ing custom icons for categories.
6. Click OK.
The category is added to the Tags palette.
Creating new subcategories
When you open the Organizer and click the Tags palette, you see several tag
categories that Elements provides by default. Categories such as Hidden,
People, Places, Events, and Other are tags that always appear when you
create any new collection. If you want to add custom subcategories to these
default tags, Elements offers you a menu command to do so.
Do the following to create a subcategory:
1. In the Organizer window, open a catalog in which you created a
custom category.
2. On the Tags palette, choose New➪
New Sub-Category.
The Create Sub-Category dialog box opens,
as shown in Figure 6-7.
Alternatively, you can right-click (Windows)
a tag on the Tags palette and choose Create
New Sub-Category in <category or subcate-
gory name> Category.
3. Type a name for the subcategory in the
Sub-Category Name text box.
4. Select a parent category from the Parent Category or Sub-Category
drop-down list.
Figure 6-6: The Create Category
dialog box.
Figure 6-7: The Create Sub-
Category dialog box.

Subcategories appear as children below parent categories or below
other subcategories. You can see all the categories and subcategories
created in the open catalog.
5. Click OK.
The subcategory is added below the category or subcategory on the
Tags palette.
Assigning and managing tags
After creating categories and subcategories on the Tags palette, you should
assign tags to files. After the tags are assigned, you can further manage the tags.
To assign tags to a file, do any of the following:
 Drag and drop files to a tag. You can drag one or more files shown in
the Organizer window and drop the files on top of a tag on the Tags
palette. The files are then tagged.
 Drag and drop a tag to a file. You can tag files by dragging and dropping
a tag from the Tags palette to a file in the Organizer window or to a
group of selected files.
 Tag categories. Drag a file to a category name or drag the category name
on the Tags palette to the selected files. The tag appears at the root of a
category and doesn’t appear in any subcategories.
 Tag subcategories. Drag a file to a subcategory name or drag the subcat-
egory name on the Tags palette to the selected files. The tag appears in
the subcategory and doesn’t appear in the root category.
 Use a menu command. Select a file or files in the Organizer and then
right-click a category or subcategory name. From the context menu that
appears, choose Attach <category name> to <number> Selected Item(s).
When you use a context menu that you open by right-clicking (Windows) or
Ctrl+clicking (Macintosh) a category or subcategory, you see menu options for
managing files. The menu commands include the name of the category from
which you open the context menu. The commands on the context menu are
 Change <category name> to a Sub-Category: Choose this command to
change a category to a subcategory.
 Edit <category name> Category: Choose this command when you want
to edit a category name, an icon’s appearance, or a parent or subcategory.
 Share <category name> tag through: Choose this menu option to share
photos.
 Delete <category name> Category: Select a category or subcategory
and choose this menu command to delete it. Alternatively, you can click
the Trash icon on the Tags palette.
121
Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos

122
Part II: Getting Organized 
 New Search Using <category name> Category: Choosing this menu
item results in the same view as when you’re clicking the square on the
Tags palette adjacent to a tag name. Only files with the selected tag are
viewed in the Organizer.
 Add Photos with <category name> Category to Search Results: You can
search for photos in the Organizer by using the search options discussed
in Chapter 5. Use this menu item to add tagged files to the search results.
 Exclude Photos with <category name> Category from Search Results:
Use this command to exclude tagged items from search results.
 Attach <category name> tag to X Selected Items: Where X represents
the number of selected items in the Organizer window, choose this com-
mand to attach the selected tag to the selected photo thumbnails.
Note that if you open a context menu on a category name versus opening a
context menu on a subcategory name, the menu items change. If you don’t
see an option that’s listed here when you open a context menu on a category,
open a context menu on a subcategory and you’ll find the command.
Hiding Files That Get in the Way
Elements offers a few ways to hide files so that you can keep your images
organized and easy to find.
The hidden tag is on the Tags palette. This tag hides files in the Organizer
window. You might use the hidden tag to hide similar images or one image
with different variations while keeping only one image in view in the
Organizer window. (You can tag files with the hidden tag by using any of the
methods for tagging files that we discuss in the preceding section.) Files
remain hidden when you click the check box adjacent to the Hidden tag.
Other ways to hide images are to create stacks and versions. Again, when
working with an image with several different variations or versions, you can
create a stack in which the best image is displayed in the Organizer window
and all members of the stack group are hidden behind that foreground image.
Additionally, you can create a version set, in which different versions of the
same image are hidden while one version remains in view in the Organizer.
In the following sections, we explain in more detail how you create stacks and
versions.
Stack ’em up
Think of stacks like a stack of cards that are face-up. You see only the front
card, and all the other cards are hidden behind that card. Stacks work the same
way: You hide different images behind a foreground image. At any time, you
can sort the images or display all images in the stack in the Organizer window.

To create a stack, follow these steps:
1. In the Organizer, select several photos.
You can select any number of photos. You
cannot stack audio or movie files.
2. Choose Edit➪Stack➪Stack Selected Photos.
Elements stacks your photos. The first image
you select remains in view in the Organizer
window. In the upper-right area, an icon that
looks like a stack of cards appears on the image
thumbnail, as shown in Figure 6-8. The thumb-
nail itself appears as though it sits atop a stack
of other thumbnails.
After you stack a group of images, you can use the Stack submenu commands
to manage the photos. Click a stack to select it and then choose Edit➪Stack.
The submenu commands that are available include
 Automatically Suggest Photo Stacks: Select this command, and Elements
searches the photos in the Organizer window for visually similar appear-
ances. Those photos having visually similar appearances are opened in
a separate window where you select photos you want to stack. Make a
selection of two or more photos and select Stack Selected Photos.
 Stack Selected Photos: This command remains grayed out unless you
have several photos selected to create a stack.
 Unstack Photos: Click a stack in the Organizer and choose this command
to return all images to the Organizer window and eliminate the stack.
 Expand Photos in Stack: This command expands the stack to show all
thumbnail images in the Organizer window.
 Collapse Photos in Stack: This command collapses a stack to show only
the top photo in the Organizer window.
 Flatten Stack: After you stack some photos, this command becomes
available.
Be careful with this command. When you flatten a stack, all photos except
for the top photo are deleted from the catalog (not from your hard disk).
 Remove Photo From Stack: Choosing this command removes the
selected photos from the stack. The menu item is available only after
you choose Reveal Photos in Stack. In the new Organizer window that
appears, you can then choose this menu command.
 Set As Top Photo: You also need to first choose Expand Photos in Stack
before accessing this command. If you don’t like the topmost photo,
select another and choose this menu command to move the selected
photo to the top of the stack.
123
Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Figure 6-8: An image 
thumbnail.

124
Part II: Getting Organized 
If you want to view all stacks in an Organizer window in expanded form,
choose View➪Expand All Stacks. Using this command doesn’t require you
to individually select stacks in the Organizer before expanding them.
Creating versions
Versions are similar to stacks, but you create versions from only one file.
You can edit an image and save the edited version and the original as a 
version set. Additional edits can be made in either editing mode and saved
to a version set. To create a version set, do the following:
1. Select an image by clicking it in the Organizer window.
2. Apply an edit.
For example, right in the Organizer, you can correct some brightness
in your image. Choose Edit➪Auto Smart Fix to adjust contrast and
brightness. See Chapter 10 for more details on adjusting contrast
and brightness.
3. View the items in the version set by clicking the image in the Organizer
and choosing Edit➪Version Set➪Expand Items in Version Set.
Elements automatically creates a version set for you when you apply the
Auto Smart Fix to the file. A new Organizer window opens and shows
two thumbnail images — one representing the original image and the
other representing the edited version.
4. To open the original in Standard Edit mode, select the original image
and choose Edit➪Go to Standard Edit from the drop-down menu on
the Organizer Shortcuts bar.
5. Edit the image in Standard Edit mode.
You can choose from many different menu commands to edit the image.
As an example, change the color mode to Indexed Color by choosing
Image➪Mode➪Indexed Color, as we explain in Chapter 3.
6. Save a version by choosing File➪Save As.
7. In the Save Options area of the Save As dialog box, select the check
boxes labeled Include in the Organizer and Save in Version Set with
Original.
8. Click Save.
The edit made in Standard Edit mode is saved as another version in your
version set.
When you have a version set, you can open the Edit➪Version Set submenu
and choose menu commands that are similar to commands available with
stacks. (See the preceding section for details.)

Sticking Digital Notes on Your Photos
A way to identify your files beyond the tagging capabilities discussed earlier
in this chapter is to add captions and notes. When you add a caption or note,
you can search captions or notes by choosing the Find➪By Caption or Note
menu command. Captions and notes are also helpful when you create differ-
ent collections — like slide presentations and photo albums — by using the
Create command, as we explain in Chapter 16.
Text captions are easy to create. Although you can select a thumbnail image
in the Organizer window and choose Edit➪Add Caption, a better way is to
use the Properties palette. Just follow these steps:
1. To open the palette, select a thumbnail
image in the Organizer, right-click it, and
choose Show Properties from the context
menu that appears.
Alternatively, you can choose Window➪
Properties. In either case, the Properties
palette opens, as shown in Figure 6-9.
2. Type a caption by adding text to the
Caption text box.
3. Type text in the Notes area on the palette
to add a note.
That’s all there is to it. You can also record
audio notes about an image. 
Automating Your Organization
If you have a number of common edits you want to make on a collection of
photos, Elements lets you perform common changes to multiple files.
With a single menu command, you can change file formats, change file attrib-
utes, and add common file base names. File renaming can be part of the Export
command, or you can use a menu option for renaming files in the Organizer.
Automating common tasks when you export
You might use the Export Selected Items dialog box frequently when you’re
acquiring images from digital cameras. What you may not know is that this
dialog box can automate other common tasks, too:

Part II: Getting Organized 
 Add common base names for the filenames (for example, change names
like DSC000001, DSC000002, and so on to more descriptive filenames,
like Budapest 001 and Budapest 002).
 Change the file format.
 Change file size and quality.
Here’s how you go about using options in the Export dialog box:
1. Select files and open the Export New Items dialog box by choosing
File➪Export➪To Computer.
The Export New Files dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-10.
Figure 6-10: The Export New Files dialog box permits you to rename and 
change formats for batches of files.
You don’t have to select files beforehand. You can identify files in
another dialog box that’s accessible from within the Export New Files
dialog box. If you know ahead of time which files you want to export, go
ahead and select them in the Organizer window.
2. Select a file type.
From the File Type options, select the format you want to use for the
exported images. For more information on file formats, see Chapter 3.

3. Select a size and quality.
If you select Use Original Format, resizing options are grayed out. You
use this setting when you want to retain the original sizes when you
rename files. If you select JPEG, you can move the quality slider, as we
explain in Chapter 3, for setting the image quality of JPEG images. None
of the other format options provides a quality option.
For sizing images, select commands from the Photo Size drop-down list,
where you find several fixed dimensions and an option for using a
custom size.
4. Select a target location for the new files by clicking the Browse button
and selecting a folder.
If you want to create a new folder, you can click the Make New Folder
button in the Browse for Folder dialog box, which opens after you click
the Browse button.
5. If you want to keep the original filenames, click the Original Names
radio button. If you want to rename files with a common base name,
select Common Base Name and type a name in the text box.
The resultant files are named <base name>001.extension, <base
name>002.extension, <base name>003.extension, and so on.
6. If you want to add files to the list for exporting, click the plus (+)
symbol in the lower-left corner.
This step opens the Add Photos dialog box, shown in Figure 6-11, which
offers a number of different options for selecting files to export.
Among your choices in this dialog box are
• Photos Currently in Browser: Click this button when you want to
export all files shown in the Organizer window.
• Entire Catalog: Click this button if you’re viewing a catalog, tagged
files, or a sorted group in which some files are temporarily hidden.
When you select this option, all hidden files are included in the
export.
• Collection: Click the Collection radio button and select from the
drop-down list a collection you want to export.
• Tag: Click the Tag radio button and select a tag from the drop-down
list. All files with the same tag are exported.
• Photo Bin: Click this radio button to select files in the Photo Bin.
(See Chapter 4 for more information on using the Photo Bin.)
• Show Favorites Only: Favorites are those files you tag with stars.
Select Favorites and all files tagged with one or more stars are
exported.
• Show Hidden Photos: Any file that might be hidden in the Organizer
can be made visible in the file list and included in the export.

Part II: Getting Organized 
• Select All: As you add files to the list window, you can choose to
export all files from the selected category. Click the Select All
button and all the files are marked for export.
• Deselect All: If you want some files from the list window exported
while others remain behind, click the Deselect All button and then
individually click the check boxes for all files you want to export.
• Add Selected Photos: When you add photos by using the options
found in the Add Photos From area in the dialog box, the thumb-
nails for the images appear in a scrollable window inside the dialog
box. You can choose individual photos by checking the boxes adja-
cent to each photo to be included in the export. After checking the
photos you want to include, click this button. The button action
doesn’t dismiss the dialog box; it merely marks the files for inclusion.
• Done: Click this button to return to the Export Selected Items
dialog box.
7. Select any images you don’t want included in the export by selecting
the check boxes adjacent to the thumbnails and then clicking the
minus (–) button.
8. Click Export.
Elements automatically exports the images to the selected folder.
Figure 6-11: The Add Photos dialog box offers a number of options for 
exporting photos.

Renaming files
If you load up an Organizer window and you want to rename files, you don’t
need to use the Export command and wade through the options in the Export
Selected Files dialog box. Just select the files you want to rename and then
choose File➪Rename. The Rename dialog box opens. In the text box, type a
base name for the files and click OK. The selected files are renamed using a
common base name. You’ll find this a quick and easy way to rename those
digital camera images.
Protecting Your Photos
The lesson most often learned the hard way by computer users is backing
up a hard drive and the precious data you spent time creating and editing.
We can save you some aggravation right now, before you spend any more
time editing your photos in Elements.
We authors are so paranoid when we’re writing a book that we back up our
chapters on multiple drives, CDs, and DVDs as chapters are written. The stan-
dard rule is that if you spend sufficient time working on a project and it gets
to the point at which redoing your work would be a major aggravation, it’s
time to back up files.
With files stored all over your hard drive, manually copying files to a second
hard drive, CD-ROM, or DVD would take quite a bit of time. Fortunately,
Elements makes the pain of finding files to back up a breeze.
Here’s how you can use Elements to create a backup of your precious data:
1. Choose File➪Backup to open the Burn/Backup Wizard.
This wizard has three panes that Elements walks you through to pain-
lessly create a backup of your files.
2. Select the source to back up.
The first pane in the Burn/Backup Wizard offers two options:
• Full Backup: Click this radio button to perform your first backup or
when you’re writing files to a new media source.
• Incremental Backup: Use this option if you have already performed
at least one backup and you want to update the backed-up files.
3. Click Next and select a target location for your backed-up files.
Active drives, including CD/DVD drives attached to your computer,
appear in the Select Destination Drive list, as shown in Figure 6-12.
Select a drive, and Elements automatically assesses the write speed and
129
Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos

130
Part II: Getting Organized 
identifies a previous backup file if one was created. The total size of the
files to copy is reported in the wizard. This information is helpful so that
you know whether more than one CD or DVD is needed to complete the
backup.
Figure 6-12: Step 2 in the wizard provides options for selecting the 
destination media for the backup.
4. If you intend to copy files to your hard drive or to another hard
drive attached to your computer, click the Browse button and identify
the path.
If you use a media source, such as a CD or DVD, Elements prompts you
to insert a disc and readies the media for writing.
5. Click Done, and the backup commences.
Be certain to not interrupt the backup. It might take some time, so just
let Elements work away until you’re notified that the backup is complete.

Part III
Selecting and
Correcting Photos

In this part . . .
T
he wide array of editing features in Elements
permit you to change, optimize, perfect, and
combine images into composite designs. In this
part, you learn how to select image content and
then alter that content for a variety of purposes,
such as correcting color, changing the appear-
ance, and extracting the content so that you can
introduce it in other photos. Because photos are
composed of many thousands of tiny pixels, you
need to develop some skill in selecting just the
pixels you want to use for any given editing task.
In addition to describing how to create image
selections, this part covers photo correction for
image contrast and brightness; color correction;
and color conversions from one color mode to
another. Rarely will you encounter digital images
that don’t require some kind of correction. In the
chapters ahead, you ﬁnd out how to quickly
master some powerful correction techniques.

f all you want to do is use your photos in all their unedited glory, feel free
to skip this chapter and move on to other topics. But if you want to occa-
sionally pluck an element out of its environment and stick it in another or
apply an adjustment on just a portion of your image, this chapter is for you.
Finding out how to make accurate selections is one of those skills
that is well worth the time you invest. In this chapter, we cover
all the various selection tools and techniques. We give you
tips on which tools are better for which kinds of selec-
tions. But remember that you usually have several
ways to achieve the same result. Which road you
choose is ultimately up to you.
Defining Selections
Before you dig in and get serious about selecting, let
us clarify for the record what we mean by defining a
selection. When you define a selection, you specify
which part of an image you want to work with. Everything
within a selection is considered selected. Everything outside
the selection is unselected. After you have a selection, you can
then adjust just that portion, and the unselected portion remains
unchanged. Or, you can copy the selected area into another image altogether.
Want to transport yourself out of your background and onto a white sandy
beach instead? Select yourself out of that backyard BBQ photo, get a stock
photo of the tropical paradise of your choice, and drag and drop yourself
onto your tropics photo with the Move tool. It’s that easy.

134
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
When you make a selection, a dotted outline — variously called a selection
border, an outline, or a marquee — appears around the selected area.
Elements, sophisticated imaging program that it is, also allows you to 
partially select pixels, which allows for soft-edged selections. You create 
soft-edged selections by feathering or anti-aliasing the selection or by using
a mask. Don’t worry: We cover these techniques later in this chapter.
For all the selection techniques described in this chapter, be sure that your
image is in the Editor, in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac), and
not in Quick Fix mode or in the Organizer.
Creating Rectangular and Elliptical Selections
If you can drag a mouse, you can master the Rectangular and Elliptical
Marquee tools. These two tools are the easiest selection tools to use, so if
your desired element is rectangular or elliptical, by all means grab one of
these tools.
The Rectangular Marquee tool, as its moniker states, is designed to select
rectangular or square selections. This tool is great to use if you want to
home in on the pertinent portion of your photo and eliminate unnecessary
background.
Here’s how to make a selection with
this tool:
1. Select the Rectangular
Marquee tool from the Tools
palette.
It looks like a dotted square. You
can also press M to access the
tool.
2. Drag from one corner of the
area you want to select to the
opposite corner.
As you drag, the selection
border appears. The marquee
follows the movement of your
mouse cursor.
3. Release your mouse button.
You now have a completed rec-
tangular selection, as shown in
Figure 7-1.
Figure 7-1: Use the Rectangular Marquee tool
to create rectangular selections.

The Elliptical Marquee tool, which shares the same flyout menu as the
Rectangular Marquee tool, is designed for elliptical or circular selections.
This tool is perfect for selecting balloons, clocks, and other rotund elements.
Here’s how to use the Elliptical Marquee:
1. Select the Elliptical Marquee tool from the Marquee flyout menu on
the Tools palette.
Again, you can also use the keyboard 
shortcut. If the Rectangular Marquee is still
visible, you need to press Shift+M. If the
Elliptical Marquee tool is showing, press M.
2. Position the crosshair near the area you
want to select and then drag around your
desired element.
With this tool, you don’t drag from corner to
corner. Instead, you drag from a given point
on the ellipse. As you drag, the selection
border appears.
3. When you’re satisfied with your selection,
release the mouse button.
Your elliptical selection is done, as shown in
Figure 7-2. If your selection isn’t quite cen-
tered around your element, simply move the
selection border by dragging inside the
border.
You can move a selection while you’re making it with either of the Marquee
tools by pressing the spacebar while you’re dragging.
Perfecting squares and circles 
with Shift and Alt (Option)
Sometimes you need to create a perfectly square or circular selection. To do
so, simply press the Shift key after you begin dragging. After you make your
selection, release the mouse button first and then release the Shift key.
When you’re making an elliptical selection, making the selection from the
center outward is often easier. To draw from the center, first click the mouse
button and then, before you move the mouse, press Alt (Option on the Mac)
and drag. When you make your selection, release the mouse button first and
then release the Alt key (Option key on the Mac).

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
If you want to draw from the center outward and create a perfect circle or
square, press the Shift key as well. After you make your selection, release the
mouse button and then release the Shift+Alt keys (Option key on the Mac).
Applying marquee options
The Marquee tools offer additional options when you need to make precise
selections at specific measurements. You also find options for making your
selections soft around the edges.
The only thing to remember is that you must select the options on the
Options bar, shown in Figure 7-3, before you make your selection with the
Marquee tools. They cannot be applied after the selection has already been
made. The exception is that you can feather a selection after the fact by
choosing Select➪Feather.
Figure 7-3: Apply marquee settings in the Options bar.
Here are the various marquee options available to you:
 Feather: Feathering creates soft edges around your selection. The amount
of softness depends on the value, from 0 to 250 pixels, you enter. The
higher the value, the softer the edges, as shown in Figure 7-4. Very small
amounts of feathering can be used to create subtle transitions between
selected elements in a collage. Larger amounts are often used when
you’re combining multiple layers so that one image gradually fades into
another. If you just want a selected element to have a soft edge without
the background, simply choose Select➪Inverse and delete the background.
See more on inversing selections in the “Modifying Your Selections” sec-
tion, later in this chapter. For more on layers, see Chapter 8.
Don’t forget that those soft edges represent partially selected pixels.
 Anti-alias: Anti-aliasing barely softens the edge of an elliptical or irregu-
larly shaped selection so that the jagged edges aren’t quite so obvious.
An anti-aliased edge is always only 1 pixel wide. We recommend leaving
this option checked for your selections. It can help to create natural
transitions between multiple selections when you’re creating collages.
 Mode: The Mode drop-down list contains three settings:
• Normal is the default setting, which allows you to freely drag a
selection of any size.

• Fixed Aspect Ratio lets you specify a fixed ratio of width to height.
For example, if you enter 3 for width and 1 for height, you get a
selection that’s three times as wide as it is high, no matter what
the size.
• Fixed Size lets you specify desired values for the width and height.
This setting can be useful when you need to make several selec-
tions that must be the same size.
 Width and Height: When you select Fixed Aspect Ratio or Fixed Size
from the Mode drop-down list, you must also enter your desired values
in the Width and Height text boxes. To swap the Width and Height values,
click the double-headed arrow button between the two measurements.
The default unit of measurement in the Width and Height text boxes is
pixels (px), but that doesn’t mean that you’re stuck with it. You can enter
any unit of measurement that Elements recognizes — pixels, inches, cen-
timeters, millimeters, points, picas, or percents. Type your value and
then type the word or abbreviation of your unit of measurement.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Making Freeform Selections with the Lasso Tools
As we all know, you can’t select everything with a rectangle or an ellipse. Life
is just way too freeform for that. Most animate, and many inanimate, objects
have undulations of varying sorts. Luckily, Elements anticipated the need to
capture these and provided the Lasso tools.
The Lasso tools enable you to make any freehand selection you can think of.
Elements generously provides three types of lasso tools:
 Lasso
 Polygonal
 Magnetic
Although all three tools are designed to make freeform selections, they differ
slightly in their methodology, as we explain in the sections that follow.
To use these tools, all that’s really required is a steady hand. You’ll find that
the more you use the Lasso tools, the better you become at your tracing
technique. Don’t worry if your initial lasso selection isn’t super accurate.
You can always go back and make corrections by adding and deleting from
your selection. To find out how, see “Modifying Your Selections,” later in this
chapter.
If you find that you really love the Lasso tools, you may want to invest in a
digital drawing tablet and stylus. This device makes tracing, and also drawing
and painting, on the computer more comfortable. It better mimics pen and
paper, and many users swear that they will never go back to a mouse after
trying it out.
Selecting with the Lasso tool
Using the Lasso tool is the digital version of tracing an outline around an
object on a piece of paper. It’s that easy. And you have only two choices on
the Options bar — Feather and Anti-alias. To find out more about these
options, see “Applying marquee options,” earlier in this chapter.
Here’s how to make a selection with the Lasso tool:
1. Select the Lasso tool from the Tools palette.
It’s the sixth tool from the top and looks like a rope. You can also just
press the L key.
2. Position the cursor anywhere along the edge of the object you want to
select.

The leading point of the cursor is the protruding end of the rope, as
shown in Figure 7-5. Don’t be afraid to zoom into your object if you need
to see the edge more distinctly. In this figure, we started at the upper-left
corner of the butterfly’s wing.
3. Hold down the mouse button and trace around your desired object.
Try to include only what you want to select.
As you trace around your object, an outline follows the mouse cursor.
Try not to release the mouse button until you return to your starting
point. When you release the mouse button, Elements assumes that
you’re done and closes the selection from wherever you released the
mouse button to your starting point, creating a diagonal line across your
image.
4. Continue tracing around the object and return to your starting point;
release the mouse button to close the selection.
You see a selection border that matches your lasso line.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Getting straight with the Polygonal Lasso tool
The Polygonal Lasso tool has a specific mission in life: to select any element
whose sides are straight. Think pyramids, stairways, skyscrapers, barns —
you get the idea. It also works a tad differently from the Lasso tool. You don’t
drag around the element with the Polygonal Lasso. Instead, you click and
release the mouse button at the corners of the element you’re selecting.
The Polygonal Lasso tool acts like a stretchy rubber band.
Follow these steps to select with the Polygonal Lasso tool:
1. Select the Polygonal Lasso tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press the L key and then press Shift+L until you get the
Polygonal Lasso tool.
2. Click and release at any point to start the Polygonal Lasso selec-
tion line.
We usually start at a corner.
3. Move (don’t drag) the mouse and click at the next corner of the object.
Continue clicking and moving
to each corner of your element.
Notice how the line stretches
out from each point you click.
4. Return to your starting point
and click to close the selection.
Be on the lookout for a small
circle that appears next to your
lasso cursor when you return to
your starting point. This circle
is an indication that you’re
indeed closing the selection at
the right spot.
Note that you can also double-
click at any point and Elements
closes the selection from that
point to the starting point.
After you close the polygonal
lasso line, a selection border
should appear, as shown in
Figure 7-6.

Elements creates a selection border.

Snapping with the Magnetic Lasso tool
The third member of the Lasso team is the Magnetic Lasso. We aren’t huge
fans of this Lasso tool, which sometimes can be hard to work with. But we
show you how it works so that you can decide for yourself whether to use it.
The Magnetic Lasso tool works by defining the areas of the most contrast in
an image and then snapping to the edge between those areas, as though the
edge has a magnetic pull.
You have the most success using the Magnetic Lasso tool on an image that
has a well-defined foreground object and high contrast between that element
and the background — for example, a dark mountain range against a light sky.
The Magnetic Lasso tool also has some unique settings, which you can adjust
on the Options bar before you start selecting:
 Width: Determines how close to the edge (between 1 and 256 pixels)
you have to move your mouse before the Magnetic Lasso tool snaps to
that edge. Use a lower value if the edge has lots of detail or if the con-
trast in the image is low. Use a higher value for high-contrast images or
smoother edges.
 Edge Contrast: Specifies the percentage of contrast (from 1 percent to
100 percent) that is required before the Magnetic Lasso snaps to an
edge. Use a higher percentage if your image has good contrast between
your desired element and the background.
 Frequency: Specifies how many points (from 1 to 100) to place on the
selection line. The higher the value, the greater number of points. As a
general rule, if the element you want to select has a smooth edge, keep
the value low. If the edge has a lot of detail, try a higher value.
 Tablet Pressure (pen icon): If you’re the proud owner of a pressure-
sensitive drawing tablet, select this option to make an increase in stylus
pressure cause the edge width to decrease.
Follow these steps to use the Magnetic Lasso tool:
1. Select the Magnetic Lasso tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press the L key and then press Shift+L until you select the
Magnetic Lasso tool. The tool looks like a straight-sided lasso with a
little magnet on it.
2. Click the edge of the object you want to select to place the first fasten-
ing point.
Fastening points anchor the selection line, as shown in Figure 7-7. You can
start anywhere; just be sure to click the edge between the element you
want and the background you don’t want.

Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 7-7: The Magnetic Lasso tool snaps to the edge of your element and places fastening
points to anchor the selection.
3. Continue to move your cursor around the object, without clicking.
As the selection line gets pinned down with fastening points, only the
newest portion of the selection line remains active.
If the Magnetic Lasso tool starts veering off the desired edge of your
object, back up your mouse and click to force down a fastening point.
Conversely, if the Magnetic Lasso tool adds a fastening point where you
don’t want one, press your Backspace key to delete it.
If the Magnetic Lasso isn’t cooperating, you can temporarily switch to
the other Lasso tools. To select the Lasso tool, press Alt (Option on
the Mac), and then press the mouse button and drag. To select the
Polygonal Lasso tool, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and click.
4. Return to your starting point and click the mouse button to close the
selection.
You see a small circle next to your cursor indicating that you’re at the
right spot to close the selection. You can also double-click, whereby
Elements closes the selection from where you double-clicked to your
starting point. The selection border appears when the selection is
closed.

Working Wizardry with the Magic Wand
The Magic Wand tool is one of the oldest tools in the world of digital imaging.
This beloved tool has been around since both Photoshop and Elements were
in their infancies. It’s extremely easy to use, but a little harder to predict what
selection results it will present.
Here’s how it works: You click inside the image, and the Magic Wand tool
makes a selection. This selection is based on the color of the pixel you
clicked. If other pixels are similar in color to your target pixel, Elements
includes them in the selection. What’s sometimes hard to predict, however, is
how to determine how similar the color has to be to get the Magic Wand tool
to select it. Fortunately, that’s where the Tolerance setting comes in. In the
sections that follow, we first introduce you to this setting and then explain
how to put the Magic Wand to work.
Talking about tolerance
The Tolerance setting determines the range of color that the Magic Wand
tool selects. It’s based on brightness levels that range from 0 to 255.
That being said:
 Setting the Tolerance to 0 selects one color only.
 Setting the Tolerance to 255 selects all colors, or the whole image.
The default setting is 32, so whenever you click a pixel, Elements analyzes the
value of that base color and then selects all pixels whose brightness levels
are between 16 levels lighter and 16 levels darker.
What if an image contains a few shades of the same color? It’s not a huge
problem. You can make multiple clicks of the Magic Wand to pick up addi-
tional pixels that you want to include in the selection. You can find out how in
the section “Modifying Your Selections,” later in this chapter. Or, you can try
a higher Tolerance setting. Conversely, if your wand selects too much, you
can also lower your Tolerance setting.
So you can see by our talk on tolerance that the Magic Wand tool works best
when you have high-contrast images or images with a limited number of
colors. For example, the optimum image for the Wand would be a solid
black object on a white background. Skip the wand if the image has a ton of
colors and no real definitive contrast between your desired element and the
background.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Wielding the wand to select
To use the Magic Wand tool to adjust Tolerance settings, follow these steps:
1. Select the Magic Wand tool
from the Tools palette.
You can’t miss it. It looks like a
wand, or maybe a fuzzy lollipop.
You can also just press W.
2. Click anywhere on your
desired element, using the
default Tolerance setting of 32.
Remember that the pixel you
click determines the base color.
If the pixel gods are with you
and you selected everything
you want on the first click,
you’re done. If your selection
needs further tweaking, like the
top image shown in Figure 7-8,
continue to Step 3.
3. Specify a new Tolerance setting
on the Options bar.
If the Magic Wand selects more
than you want, lower the
Tolerance setting. If the wand
didn’t select enough, increase
the value. While you’re poking
around the Options bar, here
are a couple more options to get
familiar with:
• Contiguous: Forces the Magic Wand to select only pixels that are
adjacent to each other. Without this option, the tool selects all
pixels within the range of tolerance, whether or not they’re adja-
cent to each other.
• Sample All Layers: If you have multiple layers and enable this
option, the Magic Wand selects pixels from all visible layers.
Without this option, the tool selects pixels from the active layer
only. For more on layers, see Chapter 8.

Tolerance 80

based on a specified Tolerance setting.

4. Click your desired element again.
Unfortunately, the Magic Wand tool isn’t magical enough to modify your
first selection automatically. Instead, it deselects the current selection
and makes a new selection based on your new Tolerance setting. If it still
isn’t right, you can adjust the Tolerance setting again. Try, try again.
Modifying Your Selections
It’s time for a seventh-inning stretch in this chapter on selection tools. In this
section, you find out how to refine that Marquee, Lasso, or Magic Wand selec-
tion to perfection. Although these tools do an okay job of capturing the bulk
of your selection, if you take the time to add or subtract a bit from your selec-
tion border, you can ensure that you get only what you really want.
You’re not limited to the manual methods described in this section, or even
to keyboard shortcuts. You can also use the four selection option buttons on
the right side of the Options bar to create a new selection (the default), add to
a selection, subtract from a selection, or intersect one selection with another.
Just choose your desired selection tool, click the selection option button you
want, and drag (or click if you’re using the Magic Wand or Polygonal Lasso
tool). The Add to Selection and Subtract from Selection buttons are also
available when you’re using the Selection Brush. When you’re adding to a
selection, a small plus sign appears next to your cursor. When you’re sub-
tracting from a selection, a small minus sign (–) appears. When you’re 
intersecting two selections, a small multiplication sign appears.
Adding to a selection
If your selection doesn’t quite contain all the elements you want to capture,
you need to add those portions to your current selection border. To add to a
current selection, simply press the Shift key and drag around the area you
want to include. If you’re using the Polygonal Lasso, click around the area.
And, if you’re wielding the Magic Wand, just press the Shift key and click the
area you want.
You don’t have to use the same tool to add to your selection as you used to
create the original selection. Feel free to use whatever selection tool you
think can get the job done. For example, it’s very common to start off with
the Magic Wand and fine-tune with the Lasso tool.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Subtracting from a selection
Got too much? To subtract from a current selection, press the Alt key
(Option key on the Mac) and drag around the pixels you want to subtract.
With the Alt key (Option key on the Mac), use the same method for the
Magic Wand and Polygonal Lasso as you do for adding to a selection.
Intersecting two selections
Get your fingers in shape. To intersect your existing selection with a second
selection, press the Shift and Alt keys together (or press the Option key on
the Mac) and drag with the Lasso tool. Or, if you’re using the Magic Wand or
Polygonal Lasso, press and click rather than drag.
Avoiding key collisions
If you read the beginning of this chapter, you found out that by pressing the
Shift key, you get a perfectly square or circular selection. We just told you
that if you want to add to a selection, you press the Shift key. What if you
want to create a perfect square while adding to the selection? Or, what if you
want to delete part of a selection while also drawing from the center outward?
Both require the use of the Alt key (or the Option key on the Mac). How in the
heck does Elements know what you want? Here are a few tips to avoid key-
board collisions — grab your desired Marquee tool:
 To add a square or circular selection, press Shift and drag. As you
drag, keep the mouse button pressed, release the Shift key for just a
second, and then press it again. Your added selection area suddenly
snaps into a square or circle. You must then release the mouse button
first and then release the Shift key last.
 To delete from an existing selection while drawing from the center
outward, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and drag. As you drag, keep the
mouse button pressed, release the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac)
for just a second, and then press it down again. You’re now drawing from
the center outward. Again, release the mouse button first, and then
release the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) last.
Painting with the Selection Brush
If you like the more organic feel of painting on a canvas, you’ll appreciate the
Selection Brush. Using two different modes, you can either paint over areas
of an image that you want to select or paint over areas you don’t want to
select. This great tool also lets you make a basic, rudimentary selection with

another tool, such as the Lasso, and then fine-tune the selection by brushing
additional pixels into or out of the selection.
Here’s the step-by-step process of selecting with the Selection Brush:
1. Select the Selection Brush from the Tools palette, or simply press the
A key.
This tool works in either Full Edit (Standard Edit on the Mac) or Quick
Fix mode.
2. Specify your Selection Brush options on the Options bar.
Here’s the rundown on each option:
• Brush Presets: Choose a brush from the presets drop-down palette.
To load additional brushes, click the downward-pointing arrow to
the left of Default Brushes and choose the preset library of your
choice. You can select the Load Brushes command from the
palette pop-up menu.
• Brush Size: Specify a brush size, from 1 to 2500 pixels. Enter the
value or drag the slider.
• Mode: Choose between Selection and Mask. Choose Selection to
add to your selection, and choose Mask to subtract from your
selection. If you choose Mask mode, you must choose some addi-
tional overlay options. An overlay is a layer of color (that shows
on-screen only) that hovers over your image, indicating protected
or unselected areas. You must also choose an overlay opacity
between 1 and 100 percent (described in a Tip paragraph at the
end of this section). You can also choose to change the overlay
color from the default red to another color. This option can be
helpful if your image contains a lot of red.
• Hardness: Set the hardness of the brush tip, from 1 to 100 percent.
3. If your mode is set to Selection, paint over the areas you want to
select.
You see a selection border. Each stroke adds to the selection. If you 
inadvertently add something you don’t want, simply press the Alt key
(Option key on the Mac) and paint over the undesired area. After you
finish painting what you want, your selection is ready to go.
4. If your mode is set to Mask, paint over the areas that you do not want
to select.
This mode does the opposite of Selection mode. When you’re done
painting your mask, choose Selection from the Mode drop-down list, or
simply choose another tool from the Tools palette, in order to convert
your mask into a selection border.
147
Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections

148
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
As you paint, you see the color of your overlay. Each stroke adds more
to the overlay area, as shown in Figure 7-9. When working in Mask mode,
you’re essentially covering up, or masking, the areas you want to protect
from manipulation. That manipulation can be selecting, adjusting color,
or performing any other Elements command. Again, if you want to
remove parts of the masked area, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and
paint.
If you painted your selection in Mask mode, your selection border is
around what you don’t want. To switch to what you do want, choose
Select➪Inverse.
Which mode should you choose? Well, it’s up to you. But one advantage
to working in Mask mode is that you can partially select areas. By paint-
ing with soft brushes, you create soft-edged selections. These soft edges
result in partially selected pixels. If you set the overlay opacity to a
lower percentage, your pixels are even less opaque, or “less selected.”
If this “partially selected” business sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because
this is also what happens when you feather selections, as we discuss
earlier in this chapter.

Painting with the Magic Selection Brush
The word Magic in front of any noun usually makes us think that we’re in for an
especially beneficial payoff. So, when you see the Magic Selection Brush, you’re
probably thinking, “Whoa, Nelly, it’s new, it’s magic — this has gotta be good.”
Theoretically speaking, this tool makes a selection when you simply draw, scrib-
ble, add a brush dot, or otherwise casually mar the area you want to select.
What’s more, theoretically speaking, you don’t even have to precisely trace
the object. Elements selects the object you want based on your brush stroke!
Okay, we’ll cut the sarcasm and get to the point. Although this tool has some
potential, it really works best when you provide it with as much data as pos-
sible. Rather than just add a dot or scribble on your desired element, for
example, if you take a few seconds longer to paint at least a rudimentary 
outline around the element, you end up with a more accurate selection.
By making a decent outline, you provide data for the tool’s algorithm to figure
out what it is you want to select. Similarly, if you further refine that initial
selection by deleting and adding areas, you provide even more data, and the
tool rewards you with an even more accurate selection. Unlike the Magic Wand,
which allows you to add to and delete from an existing selection incrementally,
the Magic Selection Brush redraws your selection from scratch each time you
modify it. It also differs from the Magic Wand in that it not only analyzes color
to make the selection, but also relies even more on texture.
By the way, this tool works in either Full Edit (Standard Edit on the Mac) or
Quick Fix mode.
Now that you understand the mechanical reasoning behind the Magic
Selection Brush, here’s how to select with this new tool:
1. Select the Magic Selection Brush tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press the F key.
2. Specify the options on the Options bar. Here’s a description of the
options:
• New Selection: The default option enables you to create a new
selection.
• Indicate Foreground (+ icon): This option allows you to add to an
existing selection.
• Indicate Background (– icon): This option enables you to subtract
from an existing selection.
• Overlay Color: As with the Selection brush, you can change the color
of your overlay from the default red to the color of your choice.
• Brush Size: Choose a brush size, from 1 to 100 pixels, from the Size
menu. If you want to try to make a more precise outline, we sug-
gest using a smaller brush.
149
Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
3. Select an area by clicking it with your mouse, dragging a brush stroke
around it, or painting over it, as shown on the left side in Figure 7-10.
When you’re done, release the mouse button.
After you release the mouse, the selection border should appear. If the
Magic Selection Brush gave you what you want, you’re done. If your
selection needs refinement, go to Step 4. (Most likely, we’ll see you at
Step 4.)
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 7-10: The Magic Selection Brush analyzes color and texture to determine 
your desired selection.

4. To add to your existing selection, activate the Indicate Foreground
option on the Options bar. Click, drag, or paint over the areas you
want to add. To delete from your existing selection, activate the
Indicate Background option on the Options bar. Click, drag, or paint
over the areas you want to remove from your existing selection.
Note that if your object is fairly detailed, like our Lacy Seahorse, you
may even need to break out the Lasso or another selection tool to make
some final clean-ups. Eventually, you should arrive at a selection you’re
happy with, as shown on the right in Figure 7-10.
Working with the Cookie Cutter Tool
The Cookie Cutter tool is a cute name for a pretty powerful tool. You can
think of it as a Custom Shape tool for images. But, although the Custom
Shape tool creates a mask and just hides everything outside the shape, the
Cookie Cutter crops away everything outside the shape. The preset libraries
offer you a large variety of interesting shapes, from talk bubbles to Swiss
cheese. (We’re not being funny here — check out the food library.)
Here’s the lowdown on using the Cookie Cutter:
1. Choose the Cookie Cutter tool from the Tools palette.
There’s no missing it; it looks like a star. You can also press the Q key.
2. Specify your options on the Options bar. Here’s the list:
• Shape: Choose a shape from the preset library. To load other
libraries, click the palette pop-up menu and choose one from the
submenu.
• Shape Options: These options let you draw your shape with certain
parameters:
Unconstrained, the default, enables you to draw freely.
Defined Proportions enables you to keep the height and width
proportional.
Defined Size crops the image to the original, fixed size of the
shape you choose. You can’t make it bigger or smaller.
Fixed Size allows you to enter your desired width and height.
From Center allows you to draw the shape from the center outward.
• Feather: This option creates a soft-edged selection. See “Applying
marquee options,” earlier in this chapter, for more details.
• Crop: Click this option to crop the image into the shape. Figure 7-11
shows an image cropped to the shape of an elephant.

Figure 7-11: Crop your photo into interesting shapes with the Cookie Cutter.
3. Drag your mouse on the image to create your desired shape. Size the
shape by dragging one of the handles of the bounding box. Position
the shape by placing the mouse cursor inside the box and dragging.
You can also perform other types of transformations, such as rotating
and skewing. For more on transformations, see Chapter 9.
4. Click the Commit button on the Options bar or press Enter to finish
the cropping.
If you want to bail out of the bounding box and not crop, you can always
press the Cancel button on the Options bar or press Esc.
Eliminating with the Eraser Tools
The Eraser tools let you erase areas of your image. Elements has three eraser
tools: the regular Eraser, the Magic Eraser, and the Background Eraser. The
Eraser tools look like those pink erasers you used in grade school, so you

can’t miss them. If you can’t locate them, you can always press E and then
Shift+E to toggle through the three tools.
When you erase pixels, those pixels are history — they’re gone. So, before
using the Eraser tools, you should probably have a backup of your image
stored somewhere. Think of it as a cheap insurance policy in case things go
awry.
The Eraser tool
The Eraser tool enables you to erase
areas on your image either to your
background color or, if you’re work-
ing on a layer, to a transparent back-
ground, as shown in Figure 7-12. For
more on layers, check out Chapter 8.
To use this tool, simply select it and
drag through the desired area on
your image, and you’re done.
Because it isn’t the most accurate
tool on the planet, remember to
zoom way in and use smaller brush
tips to do some accurate erasing.
You have several Eraser options to specify on the Options bar:
 Brush Presets: Click the drop-down palette to access the Brush presets.
Choose the brush of your choice. Again, additional brush libraries are
available from the Brushes pop-up menu.
 Mode: Select from Brush, Pencil, and Block. When you select Block,
you’re stuck with one size (a 16-x-16-pixel tip) and cannot select other
preset brushes.
 Opacity: Specify a percentage of transparency for your erased areas.
The lower the Opacity setting, the less it erases. Opacity isn’t available
in Block mode.
The Background Eraser tool
The Background Eraser tool, which is more savvy than the Eraser tool, erases
the background from an image while being mindful of leaving the foreground
untouched. The Background Eraser tool erases to transparency on a layer.
If you drag an image with only a background, Elements converts the back-
ground into a layer.
153
Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 7-12: Erase either to your background
color (left) or to transparency (right).

154
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
The key to using the Background
Eraser is to carefully keep the hot
spot, the crosshair at the center of
the brush, on the background pixels
as you drag. The hot spot samples
the color of the pixels and deletes
that color whenever it falls inside the
brush circumference. But, if you acci-
dentally touch a foreground pixel
with the hot spot, it’s erased as well.
And the tool isn’t even sorry about it!
This tool works better with images
that have good contrast in color
between the background and 
foreground objects, as shown in
Figure 7-13. Also, if your image has
very detailed or wispy edges (such as
hair or fur), you’re better off using the Magic Extractor command, described
in the next section.
Here’s the rundown on the Background Eraser options:
 Brush Preset picker: Provides settings to customize the size and
appearance of your brush tip. The size and Tolerance settings at the
bottom are for pressure-sensitive drawing tablets.
 Limits: Discontiguous erases all similarly colored pixels wherever they
appear in the image. Contiguous erases all similarly colored pixels that
are adjacent to those under the hot spot.
 Tolerance: Like the Magic Wand and the Magic Eraser, the Background
Eraser uses a Tolerance setting. The value determines how similar the
colors have to be to that of the color under the hot spot before Elements
erases them. A higher value picks up more colors, whereas a lower value
picks up fewer colors. See “Talking about tolerance,” earlier in this chap-
ter, for more details.
The Magic Eraser tool
You can think of the Magic Eraser tool as a combination Eraser and Magic
Wand tool. It selects and erases similarly colored pixels simultaneously.
Unless you’re working on a layer with the transparency locked (see Chapter 8
for more on locking), the pixels are erased to transparency. If you’re working
on an image with just a background, Elements converts the background into
a layer.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 7-13: The Background Eraser erases
similarly colored pixels sampled by the hot
spot of your brush cursor.

The Magic Eraser shares most of the same options with the other erasers.
Here are the unique options:
 Anti-alias: Creates a slightly soft edge around the transparent area.
 Sample All Layers: Samples colors using data from all visible layers, but
erases pixels on the active layer only.
Using the Magic Extractor Command
The last selection tool in the Elements repertoire is the Magic Extractor 
command. This command enables you to make selections based on your
identification of the foreground and background portions of your image.
This command is similar in methodology to the Magic Selection Brush tool.
You specify your foreground and background by simply clicking these areas
with the brush tool and “marking” them. Click the magic OK button, and your
object or objects are neatly and painlessly extracted.
Though it isn’t mandatory, you can make a rough selection first before select-
ing the Magic Extractor command. This technique obviously restricts what is
extracted and can result in a more accurate selection.
Follow these steps to magically extract your element:
1. Choose Image➪Magic Extractor.
The huge Magic Extractor dialog box appears.
2. Grab the Foreground Brush tool and click or drag to mark your 
foreground areas — or the areas you want to select.
The default color of the Foreground Brush is red.
Again, as with the Selection brush, the more accurate the data you pro-
vide to the command’s algorithm, the more accurate your extraction.
Be sure to use the Zoom and Hand tools to help magnify and move
around your image as needed. For more on these tools, see Chapter 5.
You can also change the size of your brush tip (from 1 to 100 pixels) in
the Tool Options area on the right side of the dialog box. If necessary,
change the color of your foreground and background colors by clicking
the swatch and choosing a new color from the Color Picker.
3. Select the Background Brush tool and click or drag to mark the back-
ground area or the portions you don’t want to select.
The default color of the Background Brush is blue, as shown in Figure 7-14.

Figure 7-14: The Magic Extractor allows you to identify foreground and background areas.
4. Click Preview to view your extraction.
Elements churns for a few seconds before presenting you with a look
at your extraction. You can change the preview by choosing either
Selection Area or Original Photo from the Display pop-up list.
If you want to see your selection against a different background, choose
one, such as black matte for a black background, from the Background
pop-up list.
5. If you aren’t happy with the preview of your selection, you can refine
the selection:
• To erase any markings: Select the Point Eraser tool and click or
drag over the offending areas.
• To add areas to the selection: Click or drag over your desired areas
with the Add to Selection tool.

• To delete areas from the selection: Drag with the Remove from
Selection tool.
• To smooth the edges of your foreground selection: Drag over the
edges with the Smoothing Brush tool.
• To soften the edges of your selection: Enter a value in the Feather
box. Remember: The higher the value,
the softer the edge.
• To fill a hole: Click the aptly named Fill
Holes button.
• To remove the halo of pixels between
the foreground and background areas:
Click Defringe. Enter a value in the
Defringe Width box.
If things start to get messy, you can always
start over by clicking Reset at the bottom of
the dialog box.
6. When you’re pleased with the results, click
OK to finish the selection process, as
shown in Figure 7-15, and close the
Magic Extractor dialog box.
Your newly extracted image appears as a
new file.
Using the Select Menu
In this section, we breeze through the Select menu. Along with the methods
we describe in the “Modifying Your Selections” section, earlier in this chapter,
you can use this menu to further modify selections by expanding, contract-
ing, smoothing, softening, inversing, growing, and grabbing similarly colored
pixels. If that doesn’t satisfy your selection needs, nothing will.
Selecting all or nothing
The Select All and Deselect commands are no-brainers. To select everything
in your image, choose Select➪All or press Ctrl+A (Ô+A). To deselect every-
thing, choose Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D (Ô+D). Remember that you
usually don’t have to Select All. If you don’t have a selection border in
your image, Elements assumes that the whole image is fair game for any
manipulation.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Reselecting a selection
If you sacrifice that second cup of coffee to steady your hand and take the
time to carefully lasso around your desired object, you don’t want to lose
your selection before you have a chance to perform your next move. But all it
takes is a mere inadvertent click of your mouse while you have an active
selection border to obliterate your selection. Fortunately, Elements antici-
pated such a circumstance and offers a solution. If you choose
Select➪Reselect, Elements retrieves your last selection.
One caveat: The Reselect command works only for the last selection you
made, so don’t plan to reselect a selection you made last Tuesday, or even
just 5 minutes ago, if you selected something else after that selection. If you
want to reuse a selection for the long term, you need to save it, as we explain
in “Saving and loading selections,” later in this chapter.
Inversing a selection
You know the old song lyric: If you can’t be with the one you love, love the
one you’re with. Well, Elements is kind of like that. Sometimes it’s just easier
to select what you don’t want rather than what you do want. For example, if
you’re trying to select your beloved in his or her senior photo, it’s probably
easier to just click the studio backdrop with the Magic Wand and then
inverse the selection by choosing Select➪Inverse.
Feathering a selection
In the “Applying marquee options” section, earlier in this chapter, we
describe how to feather a selection when using the Lasso and Marquee tools
by entering a value in the Feather box on the Options bar. Remember that
this method of feathering requires that you set the Feather value before you
create your selection. What we didn’t tell you is that there’s a way to apply a
feather after you make a selection.
Choose Select➪Feather and enter your desired amount from .2 to 250 pixels.
Your selection is subsequently softened around the edges.
This method is actually a better way to go. Make your selection and fine-tune
it by using the methods described earlier in this chapter. Then apply your
feather. The problem with applying the feather before you make a selection
happens when you want to modify your initial selection. When you make a
selection with a feather, the marquee outline of the selection adjusts to take
into account the amount of the feather. That means that the resulting mar-
quee outline doesn’t resemble your precise mouse movement, making it
harder to modify that selection.

Using the Modify commands
Although the commands on the Modify submenu definitely won’t win any
popularity contests, they may occasionally come in handy. Here’s the scoop
on each command:
 Border: Selects the area, from 1
to 200 pixels, around the edge of
the selection border. By choos-
ing Edit➪Fill Selection, you can
fill the border with color, as
shown in Figure 7-16.
 Smooth: Rounds off any jagged,
raggedy edges. Enter a value
from 1 to 100 pixels, and
Elements looks at each selected
pixel and then includes or dese-
lects the pixels in your selection
based on your chosen value.
Start with a low number, like 1,
2, or 3 pixels. Otherwise, it may make your selection worse.
 Expand: Enables you to increase the size of your selection by a given
number of pixels, from 1 to 100. This command is especially useful if you
just barely missed getting the edge of an elliptical selection and need it
to be a little larger.
 Contract: Decreases your selection border by 1 to 100 pixels. When
you’re compositing multiple images, you often benefit by slightly con-
tracting your selection if you plan on applying a feather. That way, you
avoid picking up a fringe of background pixels around your selection.
Applying the Grow and Similar commands
The Grow and Similar commands are often used in tandem with the Magic
Wand tool. If you made an initial selection with the Magic Wand but didn’t
quite get everything you want, try choosing Select➪Grow. The Grow com-
mand increases the size of the selection by including adjacent pixels that fall
within the range of tolerance. The Similar command is like Grow, except that
the pixels don’t have to be adjacent to be selected. The command searches
throughout the image and picks up pixels within the tolerance range.
These commands don’t have their own tolerance options. They use whatever
Tolerance value is displayed on the Options bar when the Magic Wand tool
is selected. You can adjust that Tolerance setting to include more or fewer
colors.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Saving and loading selections
Finally, there may be times when you toil so long over a complex selection
that you really want to save it for future use. Saving it is not only possible,
but also highly recommended. It’s also a piece a cake. Here’s how:
1. After you perfect your selection, choose Select➪Save Selection.
2. In the Save Selection dialog
box, leave the Selection option
set to New and enter a name
for your selection, as shown in
Figure 7-17.
The operation is automatically
set to New Selection.
3. Click OK.
4. When you want to access the
selection again, choose
Select➪Load Selection and
choose a selection from the
Selection drop-down list.
To inverse your selection, click the Invert box. Notice that you now have
available options to add to, subtract from, or intersect with your selection.
These can come in handy if you want to modify your existing selection.
For example, you may select the center and petals of a flower but not
the stem and leaves. You later decide that you really need the whole
flower. Rather than make a whole new selection, you can select just the
stem and leaves and then choose Add to Selection, and you’ve got your
whole flower. If you want, you can then save the flower as a new selec-
tion for later use.

U
sing Elements without ever using layers would be like typing a book on
an old IBM Selectric typewriter: Sure, you could do it, but it wouldn’t be
fun. An even bigger issue would occur when it came time to edit that book and
make changes. Correction tape, Wite-Out, and erasers would make that task
downright tedious, not to mention messy. The benefit of using layers
is that you have tremendous flexibility. You can quickly make
as many edits as you want for as long as you want, as long as
you keep your composite image in layers. Layers make
working in Elements a lot more productive. Don’t give
a darn about productivity? Well, let’s just say that
layers also make it a breeze for you to dabble in your
more artsy side. This chapter gives you everything
you need to know about layers. After you try them
out, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without them.
Getting to Know Layers
Think of layers as sheets of acetate or clear transparency
film. You have drawings or photographs on individual sheets.
What you place on each sheet doesn’t affect any of the other sheets.
Any area on the sheet that doesn’t have an image on it is transparent. You
can stack these sheets on top of the others to create a combined image, or

162
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
composite (or collage, if you prefer). You can reshuffle the order of the sheets,
add new sheets, and delete old sheets.
In Elements, layers are essentially a digital version of these clear acetate
sheets. You can place elements such as images, type, or shapes on separate
layers and create a composite, as shown in Figure 8-1. You can hide, add,
delete, or rearrange layers. Because layers are digital, of course, they have
some added functionality. You can adjust how opaque or transparent the ele-
ment on the layer is. You can also add special effects and change how the
colors interact between layers.
When you create a new file with background contents of white or a back-
ground color, scan an image into Elements, or open a file from a CD or your
digital camera, you basically have a file with just a background. There are no
layers yet.
An image contains only one background, and you can’t do much to it besides
paint on it and make basic adjustments. You can’t move the background or
change its transparency or blend mode. How do you get around all these limi-
tations? Convert your background into a layer by following these easy steps:
Corbis, PhotoDisc/Getty Images
Figure 8-1: Layers enable you to easily create composite images.

1. Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers palette.
The Layers palette is explained in detail in the next section.
2. Double-click Background on the Layers palette.
Or, choose Layer➪New➪Layer from Background.
3. Name the layer or leave it at the default name of Layer 0.
You can also adjust the blend mode and opacity of the layer in this
dialog box. You can also do it via the Layers palette commands later.
4. Click OK.
Elements converts your background into a layer, known also as an image
layer.
When you create a new image with transparent background contents,
the image doesn’t contain a background but instead is created with a
single layer.
Anatomy of a Layers palette
Elements keeps layers controlled on their own palette named, not surpris-
ingly, the Layers palette. To display the Layers palette, shown in Figure 8-2,
choose Window➪Layers in the Editor in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode
on the Mac).
The order of the layers on the Layers palette represents the order in the
image. We refer to this concept in the computer graphics world as the 
stacking order. The top layer on the palette is the top layer in your image, and
so on. Depending on what you’re doing, you can work either on a single layer
or on multiple layers at one time. Here are some tips for working with the
Layers palette:
 Select a layer. Click a layer name or its thumbnail. Elements highlights
the active layer on the palette.
 Select multiple contiguous layers. Click your first layer and then
Shift+click your last layer.
 Select multiple noncontiguous layers. Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac)
your desired layers.
 View and hide layers. To hide the layer, click the eye icon for that layer
so that the eye disappears. To redisplay the layer, click the blank space
in the eye column. You can also hide all the layers except one by select-
ing your desired layer and Alt+clicking (Option+clicking on the Mac)
the eye icon for that layer. Redisplay all layers by Alt+clicking (Option+
clicking on the Mac) the eye icon again. Hiding all the layers except the
one you want to edit can be helpful in allowing you to focus without the
distraction of all the other imagery.

Figure 8-2: The Layers palette controls layers in your image.
Only layers that are visible are printed. This can be useful if you want to
have several versions of an image (each on a separate layer) for a proj-
ect within the same file.
 Select the actual element (the nontransparent pixels) on the layer.
Ctrl+click (Ô+click) the layer’s thumbnail (not the name) on the palette.
 Create a new blank layer. Click the Create a New Layer icon at the top
of the palette.
 Create an adjustment layer. Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon at
the top of the palette. Adjustment layers are special layers that correct
contrast and color in your image. You can also add fill layers — layers
containing color, gradients, or patterns — by using this command. We
give you more details on adjustment and fill layers in upcoming sections.
 Duplicate an existing layer. Drag the layer to the Create a New Layer
icon at the top of the palette.

 Rearrange layers. To move a layer to another position in the stacking
order, drag the layer up or down on the Layers palette. As you drag, you
see a fist icon. Release the mouse button when a highlighted line
appears where you want to insert the layer.
If your image has a background, it always remains the bottommost layer.
If you need to move the background, convert it to a layer by double-
clicking the name on the Layers palette. Enter a name for the layer and
click OK.
 Rename a layer. When you create a new layer, Elements provides
default layer names (Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on). If you want to rename
a layer, double-click the layer name on the Layers palette and enter the
name directly on the Layers palette.
 Adjust the interaction between colors on layers and adjust the trans-
parency of layers. You can use the blend modes and the opacity options
at the top of the palette to mix the colors between layers and adjust the
transparency of the layers, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 Link layers. Sometimes you want your layers to stay grouped as a unit
to make your editing tasks easier. If so, link your layers by selecting the
layers on the palette and then clicking the Link Layers icon at the top of
the palette. A link icon appears to the right of the layer name. To remove
the link, click the Link Layers icon again.

 Lock layers. Select your desired layer and then click one of the two lock
icons at the top of the palette. The checkerboard square icon locks all
transparent areas of your layers. This prevents you from painting or
editing any transparent areas on the layers. The lock icon locks your
entire layer and prevents it from being changed in any way, including
moving or transforming the elements on the layer. You can, however,
still make selections on the layer. To unlock the layer, simply click the
icon again to toggle off the lock.
By default, the background is locked and cannot be unlocked until you
convert the background into a layer by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer
from Background.
 Delete a layer. Drag it to the trash can icon.
Using the Layer and Select menus
As with many features in Elements, you usually have more than one way to
do something. This is especially true when it comes to working with layers.
Besides the commands on the Layers palette, you have two layer menus —
the Layers menu and the Select menu, both of which you can find on the
main menu bar at the top of the application window.
The Layers menu
Much of what you can do with the Layers palette icons you can also do by
using the Layers menu on the Menu bar and the Layers palette pop-up menu
connected to the Layers palette (click the More button in the upper-right
corner). Commands such as New, Duplicate, Delete, and Rename are
omnipresent throughout. But you find commands that are exclusive to the
palette, the main Layers menu, and the Layers pop-up menu. So, if you can’t
find what you’re looking for in one area, just go to another. Some commands
require an expanded explanation and are described in sections that follow.
Here’s a quick description of most of the commands:
 Delete Linked Layers and Delete Hidden Layers: These commands
delete only those layers that have been linked or hidden from display on
the Layers palette.
 Layer Style: These commands manage the styles, or special effects, you
apply to your layers. Find more on layer styles in an upcoming section.
 Change Layer Content: Depending on the type of layer you have
selected, this command enables you to change or adjust the contents of
your layer. For example, you can change the contents of a shape layer
from a solid color into a pattern.
 Arrange: Enables you to shuffle your layer stacking order with commands
like Bring to Front and Send to Back. Reverse, a new command, switches
the order of your layers if you have two or more layers selected.

 Group with Previous and Ungroup: The Group command creates a 
clipping group, in which a group of layers is constrained to the bound-
aries of a base layer. Find more details in an upcoming section.
 Type: The commands on the Type menu control the display of type
layers. For more on type, see Chapter 13.
 Rename Layer: Enables you to give a layer a new name. You can also
simply double-click the name on the Layers palette.
 Simplify: This command converts a type layer, shape layer, or fill
layer into a regular image layer. Briefly, a shape layer contains a
vector object, whereas a fill layer contains a solid color, a gradient, 
or a pattern.
 Merge and Flatten: The various merge and flatten commands combine
multiple layers into a single layer or, in the case of flattening, combine all
your layers into a single background.
 Palette Options: You can choose display options and choose to use a
layer mask on your adjustment layers. Leave this option selected and
read more about it in the upcoming section.
The Select menu
Although the Select menu’s main duties are to assist you in making and 
refining your selections, it offers a few handy layer commands, all of
which are new additions to the menu. Here’s a quick introduction to each
command:
 Select All Layers: Want to quickly get everything in your file? Choose
Select➪All Layers.
 Select Layers of Similar Type: This command is helpful if you have differ-
ent types of layers in your document, such as regular layers, type layers,
shape layers, and adjustment layers, and you want to select just one
type. Select one of your layers and then choose Select➪Similar Layers.
For details on different types of layers, see the upcoming section.
 Deselect All Layers: Choose Select➪Deselect Layers.
Working with Different Layer Types
Layer life exists beyond just converting an existing background into a layer,
which we describe earlier. In fact, Elements offers five kinds of layers.
You’ll probably spend most of your time creating image layers, but just
so that you’re familiar with all types, the following sections describe
each one.
167
Chapter 8: Working with Layers

168
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Image layers
The image layer, usually just referred to as a layer, is the type of layer we’re
referring to when we give the analogy of acetate sheets earlier in this chapter.
You can create blank layers and add images to them, or you can create layers
from images themselves. You can have as many image layers as your com-
puter’s memory allows. Just keep in mind that the more layers you have, the
larger your file size and the slower your computer responds.
Each layer in an image can be edited without affecting the other layers.
You can move, paint, size, or apply a filter, for example, without disturbing
a single pixel on any other layer, or on the background, for that matter.
And, when an element is on a layer, you no longer have to make a selection
to select it (see Chapter 7 for selection info). Just drag the element with the
Move tool.
We tell you more about how to work with image layers later in this chapter.
Adjustment layers
An adjustment layer is a special kind of
layer used for correcting color and 
contrast. The advantage of using
adjustment layers for your corrections,
rather than applying them directly on
the image layer, is that you can apply
the corrections without permanently
affecting the pixels. They’re totally 
nondestructive. And, because the cor-
rection is on a layer, you can edit, or
even delete, the adjustment at any
time. Adjustment layers, shown in
Figure 8-4, apply the correction only to
all the layers below them, without
affecting any of the layers above them.
Another unique feature of adjustment
layers is that when you create one, you
also create a layer mask on that layer
at the same time. A layer mask is like a
second sheet of acetate that hovers
over the underlying layers. The layer
mask allows you to selectively apply
the adjustment to the layers below it
by applying shades of gray — from
white to black — on the mask. For
example, by default, the mask is com-
pletely white. This allows the adjustment to be fully applied to the layers.
If you paint on a layer mask with black, the areas under those black areas

Figure 8-4: Adjustment layers correct color
and contrast in your image.

don’t show the adjustment. If you paint
with a shade of gray, those areas par-
tially show the adjustment. The darker
the shade of gray, the less it shows the
adjustment, as shown in Figure 8-5.
Note that if you have an active selec-
tion border in your image before you
add an adjustment layer, the adjust-
ment is applied to only that area within
the selection border. The resulting
layer mask also reflects that selection:
The selected areas are white, and the
unselected areas are black.
You can also use just the layer mask to
creatively blend two layers. Create an
adjustment layer and just don’t make
any adjustment settings. Then use the
layer mask to blend two layers. Be sure
to sandwich the layer mask between
the two layers. Then select the top-
most layer and choose Layer➪Group
with Previous. Paint on your layer
mask, as described earlier in this 
section, to selectively hide and show
portions of your topmost layer.
Elements has eight kinds of adjustment
layers, and you can use as many as
you want. These adjustments are the
same adjustments you find on the
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting and Adjust Color and Filter➪Adjustments sub-
menus. For specifics on each adjustment, see Chapters 9 and 10. Here’s how
to create an adjustment layer:
1. Open an image that needs a little contrast or color correction.
Note that you don’t need to convert your background into a layer to
apply an adjustment layer.
2. Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon on the Layers palette.
3. From the drop-down list at the top of the Layers palette, choose your
desired adjustment.
The dialog box specific to your adjustment appears.
4. Make necessary corrections and click OK.
After you close the dialog box, the adjustment layer appears on the Layers
palette. The Adjustment Layer icon and a thumbnail appear on the adjust-
ment layer. The thumbnail represents the layer mask we just described.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
You can paint on the layer mask to selectively allow only portions of your
image to receive the adjustment. Use the Brush or Pencil tool to paint. Or,
you can also make a selection and fill that selection with any shade of gray,
from white to black. Finally, you can use the Gradient tool on the mask to
create a gradual application of the adjustment.
As with image layers, you can adjust the opacity and blend modes of an
adjustment layer. Reducing the opacity of an adjustment layer reduces the
effect of the adjustment on the underlying layers.
Here are a few more tips on using adjustment layers:
 To view your image without the adjustment, click the eye icon in the
left column of the Layers palette to hide the adjustment layer.
 To delete the adjustment layer, drag it to the trash can icon on the
Layers palette.
 To edit an adjustment layer, simply double-click the adjustment layer
on the Layers palette. You can also choose Layer➪Layer Content
Options. In the dialog box that appears, make any edits and then
click OK. The only adjustment layer that you cannot edit is the Invert
adjustment. It’s either on or off.
 To switch to a different adjustment layer, choose Layer➪Change Layer
Content and choose a different adjustment layer from the submenu.
Fill layers
A fill layer lets you add a layer of solid color, a gradient, or a pattern.
Like adjustment layers, fill layers also include layer masks. You can edit,
rearrange, duplicate, delete, and merge fill layers similarly to adjustment
layers. You can blend fill layers with other layers by using the opacity and
blend mode options on the Layers palette. Finally, you can restrict the fill
layer to just a portion of your image by either making a selection first or
painting on the mask later.
Follow these steps to create a fill layer:
1. Open an image.
Use an image that will look good with a frame or border of some kind.
Remember that if you don’t have a selection, the fill layer covers your
whole image.
2. Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon on the Layers palette. From
the drop-down list, choose a fill of a solid color, gradient, or pattern.
The dialog box specific to your type of fill appears.

3. Specify your options, depending on the fill type you chose in Step 2:
• Solid Color: Choose your desired color from the Color Picker. See
Chapter 12 for details on choosing colors and also gradients and
patterns.
• Gradient: Click the downward-pointing arrow to choose a preset
gradient from the drop-down palette or click the gradient preview
to display the Gradient Editor and create your own gradient.
• Pattern: Select a pattern from the drop-down palette. Enter a value
to scale your pattern if you want. Click Snap to Origin to make the
origin of the pattern the same as the origin of the document. Select
the Link with Layer option to specify that the pattern moves with
the fill layer if you move it.
4. Click OK.
The fill layer appears on the Layers palette, as shown in Figure 8-6.
Notice the layer mask that was created on the fill layer.

Shape layers
If you haven’t made your way to Chapter 12 yet, you may be surprised to 
discover that Elements also lets you draw shapes with six different drawing
tools. These shapes also have the bonus of being vector-based. This term
means that the shapes are defined by mathematical equations, which create
points and paths, rather than by pixels. The advantage of vector-based
objects is that you can freely size these objects without causing degradation.
In addition, they’re always printed with smooth edges, not with the jaggies
you’re familiar with seeing in pixel-based elements.
To create a shape layer, grab a shape tool from the Tools palette and drag it
on your canvas. When you create a shape, it resides on its own, unique shape
layer, as shown in Figure 8-7. As with other types of layers, you can adjust the
blend modes and opacity of a shape layer. You can edit, move, and transform
the actual shapes. However, to apply filters, you must first simplify the shape
layer. This process converts the vector paths to pixels.

Type layers
To add words to your images, as shown in Figure 8-7, click your canvas with
the Type tool and just type. It’s really as easy as that. Well, you can specify
options, such as a font family and size, on the Options bar, but when you
click the Commit button on the Options bar, you create a type layer. On the
Layers palette, you see a layer with a T icon. For details on working with
type, check out Chapter 13.
Tackling Layer Basics
Image layers are the heart and soul of the layering world. You can create 
multiple image layers within a single image. Even more fun is creating a com-
posite from several different images. Add people you like; take out people
you don’t. Pluck people out of boring photo studios and put them in exotic
locales. The creative possibilities are endless. In this section, we cover all the
various ways to create image layers. We cover how to convert a background
into a layer at the beginning of this chapter, in the section “Getting to Know
Layers.” These next few sections describe how to create an image layer by
using various other methods.
Creating a new layer from scratch
If you’re creating a new, blank file, you can select the Transparent option for
your background contents. Your new file is created with a transparent layer
and is ready to go. If you have an existing file and want to create a new, blank
layer, here are the ways to do so:
 Click the Create a New Layer icon at the top of the Layers palette.
 Choose New Layer from the Layers palette pop-up menu.
 Choose Layer➪New➪Layer. Note that if you create a layer by using
either of the menu commands, you’re presented with a dialog box with
options. There, you can name your layer and specify options for group-
ing, blending, and adjusting opacity. Provide a name for your layer and
click OK. You can always adjust the other options directly on the Layers
palette later.
You can also use the Copy and Paste commands without even creating a
blank layer first. When you copy and paste a selection without a blank layer,
Elements automatically creates a new layer from the pasted selection.
A better method of copying and pasting between multiple images, however,
is to use the drag-and-drop method described later in this section.
173
Chapter 8: Working with Layers

174
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
The Copy Merged command on the Edit menu creates a merged copy of all
visible layers within the selection.
After you create your layer, you can put selections or other elements on that
layer by doing one or more of the following:
 Grab a painting tool, such as the Brush or Pencil, and paint on the layer.
 Make a selection on another layer or on the background within the same
document or from another image entirely and then choose Edit➪Copy.
Select your new, blank layer on the Layers palette and then choose
Edit➪Paste. You can also
choose Select➪All and then
copy and paste to transfer an
entire image to the new layer.
 Make a selection on another
layer or on the background
within the same document or
from another image and then
choose Edit➪Cut. Select your
new, blank layer and then
choose Edit➪Paste. Be aware
that this action removes that
selection from its original loca-
tion and leaves a transparent
hole, as shown in Figure 8-8.
Using Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut
Another way to create a layer is to use the Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut
commands on the Layer menu. Make a selection on a layer or background
and choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy or Layer via Cut. Elements automati-
cally creates a new layer and puts the copied or cut selection on the layer.
Remember that if you use the Layer via Cut command, your selection is
deleted from its original location layer and you’re left with a transparent hole.
If you use the background for the source, your background color fills the
space. A reminder: You can use these two commands only within the same
image. You cannot use them between multiple images.
Duplicating layers
Duplicating layers can be helpful if you want to protect your original image
while experimenting with a technique. If you don’t like the results, you can
always delete the duplicated layer. No harm, no foul.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 8-8: When you cut a selection from a
layer, take note of the resultant hole in the
original location.

To duplicate an existing layer, select it on the Layers palette and do one of
three things:
 Drag the layer to the Create a New Layer icon at the top of the palette.
Elements creates a duplicate layer with Copy appended to the name of
the layer.
 Choose Duplicate Layer from the Layers palette pop-up menu.
 Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer. If you use the menu methods, a dialog
box appears, asking you to name your layer and specify other options.
Provide a name for your layer and click OK. You can specify the other
options later, if you want.
Dragging and dropping layers
The most efficient way to copy and paste layers between multiple images is
to use the drag-and-drop method. Why? Because it bypasses your clipboard,
which is the temporary storage area on your computer for copied data.
Storing data, especially large files, can bog down your system. By keeping
your clipboard clear of data, your system operates more efficiently. If you
already copied data and it’s lounging on your clipboard, choose Edit➪Clear➪
Clipboard to empty your clipboard.
Here’s how to drag and drop layers from one file to another:
1. Select your desired layer on the Layers palette.
2. Grab the Move tool (the four-headed arrow) from the Tools palette.
3. Drag and drop the layer onto your destination file.
The dropped layer pops in as a new layer above the active layer in the
image. You don’t need to have a selection border to copy the entire
layer. But, if you want to copy just a portion of the layer, make your
selection before you drag and drop with the Move tool. If you want the
selected element to be centered on the destination file, press the Shift
key as you drag and drop.
Here’s a handy tip. If you have several elements (that aren’t touching each
other) on one layer and you want to select only one of the elements to drag
and drop, use the Lasso tool to make a crude selection around the object
without touching any of the other elements. Then press the Ctrl (Ô on the
Mac) key and press the up-arrow key once. The element then becomes per-
fectly selected. Drag and drop with the Move tool as described in Step 3 in
this section.
175
Chapter 8: Working with Layers

176
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Using the Paste into Selection command
The Paste into Selection command lets you put an image on a separate layer
while also inserting that image into a selection border. For example, in
Figure 8-9, we used this command to make it appear as though our surfer is
in the water.
Figure 8-9: Use the Paste into Selection command to make one element 
appear as though it’s coming out of another element.
You can do the same by following these steps:
1. Make your desired selection on the layer in your destination image.
In our figure, we selected the area in the water where the surfer would
be positioned.
2. Select the image that will fill that selection.
The image can be within the same file or from another file. Our surfer
was in another file.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
4. Return to the destination image layer and choose Edit➪Paste into
Selection.
Elements converts the selection border on the layer into a layer mask.
The pasted selection is visible only inside the selection border. In our
example, the surfer only shows inside the selected area. His ankles and
feet are outside the border and therefore are hidden.

Moving a Layer’s Content
Moving the content of a layer is a piece of cake: Grab the Move tool from the
Tools palette, select your layer on the Layers palette, and drag the element
on the canvas to your desired location. You can also move the layer in 1-pixel
increments by using the keyboard arrow keys. Press Shift with the arrows to
move in 10-pixel increments.
The Auto-Select Layer option on the Options bar enables you to switch to a
layer when you click any part of that layer with the Move tool. But be careful
if you have a lot of overlapping layers because this technique can sometimes
be more trouble than it’s worth.
The Move tool has received a couple of new options in Elements 5. Here’s the
lowdown:
 Show Highlight on Rollover: Hover your mouse anywhere over the
canvas and you see an outline around the element on your layer.
Click the highlighted layer to select it and then move it.
 Link Layers: This option connects the layers to allow ease in moving
multiple layers simultaneously. Select a layer and then Shift+click to
select more layers. Click the Link Layers option.
 Arrange menu: This menu enables you to move your selected layer in
front or back of other layers.
 Align menu: Align your selected layers on the left, center, right, top,
middle, and bottom. As with linking, select your first layer and then
Shift+click to select more layers. Choose an alignment option.
 Distribute menu: Use this menu to evenly space your selected layers on
the left, center, right, top, middle, and bottom. As with aligning, select
your first layer and then Shift+click to select more layers. Choose your
desired distribution option.
Transforming Layers
When working with layers, you may find the need to scale or rotate some
of your images. You can do so easily by applying the Transform and Free
Transform commands. The methods to transform layers and transform selec-
tions are identical.
177
Chapter 8: Working with Layers

178
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Here’s how to transform a layer:
1. Select your desired layer.
You can also apply a transformation to multiple layers simultaneously
by linking the layers first.
2. Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform.
A bounding box surrounds the contents of your layer. Drag a corner
handle to size the contents. Press Shift while dragging to constrain the
proportions. To rotate the contents, move the mouse cursor just outside
a corner handle until it turns into a curved arrow and then drag. To dis-
tort, skew, or apply perspective to the contents, right-click and choose
the desired command from the context menu. If you would rather enter
your transform values numerically, you can do so in the fields on the
Options bar.
If you want to apply just a single transformation, you can also choose the
individual Distort, Skew, and Perspective commands from the Image➪
Transform menu. Or, to rotate or flip, you can choose Image➪Rotate.
3. When your layer is transformed to your liking, double-click inside the
bounding box or click the Commit button on the Options bar.
Try to perform all your transformations in one execution. Each time you
transform pixels, you put your image through the interpolation process
(see Chapter 3 for more on interpolation). Done to the extreme, this process
can degrade the quality of your image. This is why it’s prudent to use the
Free Transform command rather than individual commands — so that all
transformations can be executed in one fell swoop.
When the Move tool is active, you can transform a layer without choosing
a command. Select the Show Bounding Box option on the Options bar.
This option surrounds the layer, or selection, with a box with handles.
Drag the handles to transform the layer or selection.
Flattening and Merging Layers
Layers are fun and fantastic, but they can quickly chew up your computer’s
RAM and bloat your file size. And sometimes, to be honest, having too many
layers can start to make your file tedious to manage, thereby making you less
productive. Whenever possible, you can merge your layers to save memory
and space. Merging combines visible, linked, or adjacent layers into a single
layer (not a background). The intersection of all transparent areas is retained.

In addition, if you need to import your file into another program, certain pro-
grams don’t support files with layers. Therefore, you may need to flatten your
file before importing it. Flattening an image combines all visible layers into a
background. Hidden layers are discarded, and any transparent areas are filled
with white. We recommend, however, that before you flatten your image,
you make a copy of the file with all its layers intact and save it as a native
Photoshop file. That way, if you ever need to make any edits, you have the
added flexibility of having your layers.
By the way, the only file formats that support layers are native Photoshop
(.psd); Tagged Image File Format, or TIFF (.tif); and Portable Document
Format, or PDF (.pdf). If you save your file in any other format, Elements
automatically flattens your layers into a background.
Merging layers
You can merge your layers in a couple of ways. Here’s how:
 Display only those layers you want to merge. Click the eye icon on the
Layers palette to hide those layers you don’t want to merge. Choose
Merge Visible from the Layers palette pop-up menu or the Layer menu.
 Arrange the layers you want to merge so that they’re adjacent to each
other on the Layers palette. Select the topmost layer of that group and
choose Merge Down from the Layers palette pop-up menu or the Layer
menu. Note that Merge Down merges your active layer with the layer
directly below it.
Flattening layers
To flatten an image, follow these steps:
1. Make certain that all layers you want to retain are visible, because
any hidden layers are discarded.
2. Choose Flatten Image from the Layers palette pop-up menu or the
Layer menu.
All your layers are combined into a single background. Any transparent
areas are filled with the background color, as shown in Figure 8-10.
If you mistakenly flatten your image, choose Edit➪Undo or use your
Undo History palette. (If you’re not familiar with the History palette,
see Chapter 1 for details.)

Simple Image Makeovers
In This Chapter
 Cropping and straightening images
 Employing one-step auto fixes
 Editing with Quick Fix mode
 Fixing small imperfections
F
ixing images quickly without pain or hassle is probably one of the most
desirable features you’ll find in Elements and one that we’re sure you
will embrace frequently. Whether you’re an experienced photographer or an
amateur shutterbug, cropping away unwanted background, tweaking the
lighting or color of an image, and erasing away the minor blemishes of a
loved one’s face are all editing tasks you’ll most likely tackle. With these
simple image-makeover tools in Elements, these tasks are as easy as click-
ing a single button or as difficult as a few swipes with a brush.
Cropping and Straightening Images
Cropping a photo is probably one of the easiest
things you can do to improve the composition of
your photo. Getting rid of the unnecessary back-
ground around your subject creates a better focal
point. Another dead giveaway of amateurish photog-
raphy is crooked horizon lines. Not a problem.
Elements gives you several ways to straighten those
images after the fact. So, after your next photo shoot,
launch the Elements Editor and get in there and crop and
straighten your images before you show them off. No one
will be the wiser that the images were digitally doctored.
Cutting away with the Crop tool
The most common way to crop a photo is by using the Crop tool. Simple,
quick, and easy, this tool gets the job done. Here’s how to use it:

182
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
1. Select the Crop tool from the Tools palette in either Full Edit
(Standard Edit on the Mac) or Quick Fix mode.
You can also press the C key. For details on the different workspaces, see
Chapter 1. For full details on Quick Fix mode, see the upcoming section
“Editing with Quick Fix.”
2. Specify your aspect ratio options on the Options bar. Here are your
choices:
• No Restriction: Allows you to freely crop the image at any size.
• Use Photo Ratio: Retains the original aspect ratio of the image when
you crop.
• Preset Sizes: Offers a variety of common photographic sizes. When
you crop, your image then becomes that specific dimension.
When you crop an image, Elements retains the original resolution
of the file. To keep your image at the same resolution, therefore,
while simultaneously eliminating por-
tions of your image, Elements must
resample the file. Consequently, your
image must have sufficient resolution
so that the effects of the resampling
aren’t as noticeable. This is especially
true if you’re choosing a larger preset
size. If all this talk about resolution and
resampling is fuzzy, be sure to check
out Chapter 3.
• Width and Height: Enables you to spec-
ify a desired width and height to crop
your image.
3. Drag around the portion of the image you
want to retain and release the mouse button.
As you drag, a crop marquee bounding box
appears. Don’t worry if your cropping mar-
quee isn’t exactly correct. You can adjust it in
the next step.
The area outside the cropping marquee
(called a shield) appears darker than the
inside in order to better frame your image, as
shown in Figure 9-1. If you want to change
the color and opacity of the shield, or if you
don’t want it at all, change your Crop prefer-
ences (choose Edit➪Preferences➪Display &
Cursors, or choose Elements➪Preferences➪
Display & Cursors on the Mac).

4. Adjust the cropping marquee by dragging the handles of the crop
marquee bounding box.
To move the entire marquee, position your mouse inside the marquee
until you see a black arrowhead cursor and then drag.
If you move your mouse outside the marquee, your cursor changes to a
curved arrow. Drag with this cursor to rotate the marquee. This action
allows you to both rotate and crop your image simultaneously — handy
for straightening a crooked image. Just be aware that rotation, unless it’s
in 90 degree increments, also resamples your image.
5. Double-click inside the cropping marquee.
You can also just press Enter (Return on the Mac) or click the green
Commit button next to the marquee. Elements then discards the area
outside the marquee. To cancel your crop, click the red Cancel button.
Cropping with a selection border
You can also crop an image by choosing the Image➪Crop command in either
Full Edit (Standard Edit mode on the Mac) or Quick Fix mode. First, make a
selection with any of the selection tools and then choose the command. You
can use this technique with any selection border shape. That is, your selec-
tion doesn’t have to be rectangular. It can be round or even freeform. Your
cropped image doesn’t take on that shape, but Elements crops as close to the
boundaries of the selection border as it can, as shown in Figure 9-2. For
details about making selections, see Chapter 7.
Straightening images
There may be times when you just didn’t quite get that horizon straight when
you took a photo of the beach. Or, maybe you scanned a photo and it wasn’t
quite centered in the middle of the scanning bed. It’s not a big deal. Elements
gives you several ways to straighten an image.
Using the Straighten tool
This new tool enables you to specify a new straight edge and then rotates the
image accordingly. Here’s how to use the Straighten tool:
1. Select the Straighten tool from the Tools palette (or press the P key)
only in Full Edit mode (or Standard Edit mode on the Mac).
2. Specify your desired setting from the Canvas Options on the Options
bar. Here are your choices:
• Grow Canvas to Fit: Rotates the image and increases the size of the
canvas to fit the image area.
183
Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers

184
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
• Crop to Remove Background: Trims off background canvas outside
the image area. This choice is helpful if you scan an image and
white areas appear around your photo that you want removed.
• Crop to Original Size: Rotates your image without trimming off any
background canvas.
3. Select Rotate All Layers, if you want.
If you have an image with layers and you want all of them rotated, select
this option.
4. Draw a line in your image to represent the new straight edge.
Your image is then straightened and, if you chose either of the crop
options in Step 2, also cropped.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 9-2: Elements can crop to any selection border shape.

Using the Straighten menu commands
In addition to using the Straighten tool, you can straighten your images by
using two commands on the Image menu, in either Full Edit (or Standard Edit
mode on the Mac) or Quick Fix mode:
 To automatically straighten an image without cropping, which leaves
the canvas remaining around the image: Choose Image➪Rotate➪
Straighten Image.
 To automatically straighten and crop the image simultaneously:
Choose Image➪Rotate➪Straighten and Crop Image.
Using the Divide Scanned Photos command
The Divide Scanned Photos command is helpful if you want to save time by
scanning multiple photos into one document. Cram all the photos you can on
your scanning bed and get one initial scan. Just make sure that a clear sepa-
ration exists between all the images. Then choose Image➪Divide Scanned
Photos in either Full Edit (or Standard Edit mode on the Mac) or Quick Fix
mode. Elements divides the images and places each one in a separate file, as
shown in Figure 9-3. Note that if you have images with a lot of white in them,
such as snow, you should cover the scanner with a piece of dark paper to
better delineate the boundaries of each image.

Photos command.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Employing One-Step Auto Fixes
Elements has five automatic lighting-, contrast-, and color-correction tools
that can improve the appearance of your images with just one menu command.
These commands are available in either Full Edit (or Standard Edit mode on
the Mac) or Quick Fix mode, and they’re all on the Enhance menu. For more
on Quick Fix mode, see the upcoming section “Editing with Quick Fix.”
The advantage of these one-step correctors is that they’re extremely easy to
use. You don’t need to have one iota of knowledge about color or contrast to
use them. The downside to using them is that sometimes the result isn’t as
good as you could get via a manual color-correction method. And, sometimes
these correctors may even make your image look worse than before by giving
you weird color shifts. But because these correctors are quick and easy, give
them a try on an image that needs some help. Usually, you don’t want to use
more than one of the auto fixes. If one doesn’t work on your image, undo the
fix and try another. If you still don’t like the result, move on to one of the
manual methods described in Chapter 10.
Auto Smart Fix
This all-in-one command is touted to adjust it all. It’s designed to improve
lighting, improve the details in shadow and highlight areas, and correct the
color balance, as shown in Figure 9-4. The overexposed image on the left was
improved quite nicely with the Auto Smart Fix command.
The Auto Smart Fix command is available in the Organizer, where you can
apply this command to several selected images simultaneously. It’s also avail-
able in the Slide Show editor.
Figure 9-4: In a hurry? Apply the Auto Smart Fix command to quickly improve an image.

If the Auto Smart Fix was just too “auto” for you, you can crank it up a notch
and try Adjust Smart Fix. This command is similar to Auto Smart Fix, but
gives you a slider where you, not Elements, control the amount of correction
applied to the image.
Auto Levels
The Auto Levels command adjusts the overall contrast of an image. This com-
mand works best on images that have pretty good contrast (detail in the
shadow, highlight, and midtone areas) to begin with and need just a minor
amount of adjustment. Auto Levels works by mapping, or converting, the
lightest and darkest pixels in your image to black and white, thereby
making highlights appear lighter and shadows appear darker, as shown in
Figure 9-5.
Figure 9-5: Auto Levels adjusts the overall contrast of an image.
Although Auto Levels can improve your contrast, it may also produce an
unwanted colorcast (a slight trace of color). If this happens, undo the com-
mand and try the Auto Contrast command instead. If that still doesn’t
improve the contrast, it’s time to bring out the big guns. Try the Levels 
command described in Chapter 10.
Auto Contrast
The Auto Contrast command is designed to adjust the overall contrast in an
image without adjusting its color. This command may not do as good a job of
improving contrast as the Auto Levels command, but it does a better job of
retaining the color balance of an image. Auto Contrast usually doesn’t cause
187
Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers

188
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
the funky colorcasts that can occur when you’re using Auto Levels. This com-
mand works great on images with a haze, as shown in Figure 9-6.
PhotoDisc/Getty Images
Figure 9-6: The Auto Contrast command works wonders on hazy images.
Auto Color Correction
The Auto Color Correction command adjusts both the color and contrast of
an image, based on the shadows, midtones, and highlights it finds in the
image and a default set of values. These values adjust the amount of black
and white pixels that Elements removes from the darkest and lightest areas of
the image. You usually use this command to remove a colorcast or to balance
the color in your image, as shown in Figure 9-7. Occasionally, this command
can also be useful in correcting oversaturated or undersaturated colors.
Figure 9-7: Use Auto Color Correction to remove a colorcast.

Auto Sharpen
Photos taken with a digital camera or scanned on a flatbed scanner often
suffer from a case of overly soft focus. Sharpening gives the illusion of
increased focus by increasing the contrast between pixels. Auto Sharpen
attempts to improve the focus, as shown in Figure 9-8, without overdoing it.
What happens when you oversharpen? Your images go from soft to grainy
and noisy. Always make sharpening your last fix after you have made all your
other fixes and enhancements. For more precise sharpening, check out the
Unsharp Mask and Adjust Sharpness features covered in Chapter 10.
Figure 9-8: Use Auto Sharpen to improve focus.
Auto Red Eye Fix
This command is self-explanatory. The Auto Red Eye Fix command automati-
cally detects and eliminates red-eye in an image. Red-eye happens when a
person or animal (where red eye can also be yellow, green, or even blue eye)
looks directly into the flash. Many cameras have a red-eye prevention mode,
which is a pre-flash that causes the subjects’ irises to contract, making their
pupils smaller when the real flash goes off. Other cameras mount the flash
high or to side of the lens, which also reduces the chance of red-eye. But if
you have neither of these camera options, or if it just happened, it isn’t diffi-
cult to rectify demonic red-eye after the fact.
189
Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers

190
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
The Auto Red Eye Fix command is also available in the Organizer, where you
can apply this command to several selected images simultaneously. You can
also automatically apply this fix when you acquire your images. Select the
Automatically Fix Red Eyes check box in the File➪Get Photos dialog box.
And, as with Auto Smart Fix, you can now access this tool in the Slide Show
editor as well.
If for some reason the Auto Red Eye Fix doesn’t quite do the trick, you can
always reach for the Red Eye Removal tool on the Tools palette. Here’s how
to remove red-eye manually:
1. Select the Red Eye Removal tool from the Tools palette.
Using the default settings, click the red portion of the eye in your image.
This one-click tool darkens the pupil while retaining the tonality and tex-
ture of the rest of the eye, as shown in Figure 9-9.
Figure 9-9: The Auto Red Eye Fix and the Red Eye Removal tool detect and destroy dreaded
red-eye.
2. If you’re unhappy with the fix, adjust one or both of these options:
• Pupil Size: Use the slider to increase or decrease the size of the
pupil.
• Darken Pupil: Use the slider to darken or lighten the color of the
pupil.

Editing with Quick Fix
If you use the Auto Fixes we cover in the preceding section while working in
Quick Fix mode, you may find all you need to repair and enhance your images
and rarely visit Full Edit mode (or Standard Edit mode on the Mac). And so, in
this section, we offer a closer look at Quick Fix mode.
Quick Fix mode is a pared-down version of Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode
on the Mac) that conveniently provides basic fixing tools and tosses in a few
unique features, such as a before-and-after preview of your image.
Here’s a step-by-step workflow that you can follow in Quick Fix mode to
repair your photos:
1. Select one or more photos in the Organizer and then choose Go to
Quick Fix from the Edit menu or the Shortcuts bar. Or, if you’re in
Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac), click the Quick Fix
button in the upper-right area of the application window.
If you happen to be in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac)
with an image already open, this image is transported into Quick Fix
mode. Note that you can also open images by simply choosing the
File➪Open menu command.
2. Specify your preview preference from the View pop-up menu at the
bottom of the application window.
You choose to view just your original image (before), your fixed image
(after), or both images side-by-side in either portrait or landscape orien-
tation, as shown in Figure 9-10.
3. Use the Zoom and Hand tools to magnify and navigate around your
image. See Chapter 5 for more on these tools.
You can also specify the Zoom percentage by using the Zoom slider at
the bottom of the application window.
4. Crop your image by using the Crop tool on the Tools palette.
You can also use any of the methods described earlier, in the “Cropping
and Straightening Images” section, except for the Straighten tool, which
is exclusive to Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac).
5. To rotate the image in 90-degree increments, click the Rotate Left or
Rotate Right button at the bottom of the application window.
6. Use the Red Eye tool to remove the red from your subjects’ eyes.
Note that you can also automatically fix red-eye by clicking the Auto
button under Red Eye Fix on the General Fixes palette on the right side
of the application window. Both these methods are described earlier in
this chapter, in the section “Auto Red Eye Fix.”
191
Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers

192
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Figure 9-10: Quick Fix mode enables you to view before-and-after previews of your image.
7. Apply any necessary auto fixes, such as Auto Smart Fix, Auto Levels,
Auto Contrast, and Auto Color Correction.
All these commands are on the Enhance menu or in the General Fixes,
Lighting, and Color palettes on the right side of the application window.
Each of these fixes is described in detail earlier in this chapter.
Remember that usually one of the fixes is enough. Don’t stack them on
top of each other. If one doesn’t work, click the Reset button near the
image preview and try another. If you’re not happy, go to Step 8.
8. If the auto fixes don’t quite cut it, you get more control by using the
sliders available for Smart Fix, Contrast, and Color, located on the
palettes on the right of the application window. If auto fixes did create
a result that you’re happy with, skip to Step 9.
Here’s a brief description of each available adjustment:
• Lighten Shadows: When you drag the slider to the right, lightens
the darker areas of your image without adjusting the highlights.

• Darken Highlights: When you drag the slider to the right, darkens
the lighter areas of your image without adjusting the shadows.
• Midtone Contrast: Adjusts the contrast of the middle (gray) values
and leaves the highlights and shadows as is.
• Saturation: Adjusts the intensity of the colors.
• Hue: Changes all colors in an image. Make a selection first to
change the color of just one or more elements. Otherwise, use
restraint with this adjustment.
• Temperature: Adjusts the colors warmer (red) or cooler (blue).
This adjustment can be used to correct skin tones or to correct
overly cool images (such as snowy winter photos) or overly warm
images (such as photos shot at sunset or sunrise).
• Tint: Adjusts the tint after you adjust temperature to make the
color more green or magenta.
If you still don’t get the results you need, move on to one of the more
manual adjustments, described in Chapter 10.
Note that you can also apply fixes to just selected portions of your
image. Quick Fix mode offers the Selection Brush and Magic Selection
Brush tools for your selection tasks. For details on using these tools, see
Chapter 7.
9. Finally, sharpen your image either automatically, by clicking the Auto
button, or manually, by dragging the slider on the Sharpen palette.
This fix should always be the last adjustment you make on your image.
Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
Elements enables you to clone elements without the hassle of genetically
engineering DNA. In fact, the Clone Stamp tool works by just taking sampled
pixels from one area and copying, or cloning, them onto another area.
The advantage of cloning over making a selection and copying and pasting
is that it’s easier to realistically retain soft-edged elements, such as shadows,
as shown in Figure 9-11.
The Clone Stamp doesn’t stop there. You can also use this tool for fixing
flaws, such as scratches, bruises, and other minor imperfections. Although
the birth of the healing tools (discussed later in this chapter) has somewhat
pushed the Clone Stamp tool out of the retouching arena, it can still do a
good repair job in many instances.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-11: The Clone Stamp tool enables you to realistically 
duplicate soft-edged elements, such as shadows.
Here’s how to use the Clone Stamp tool:
1. Choose the Clone Stamp tool from the Tools palette in Full Edit mode
(Standard Edit mode on the Mac).
You can also press the S key.
2. On the Options bar, choose a brush from the Brush Preset drop-down
list. Use the brush as is or adjust its size with the Size slider.
Keep in mind that the size of the brush you specify should be appropri-
ate for what you’re trying to clone or retouch. If you’re cloning a large
object, use a larger brush. For repairing small flaws, use a smaller brush.
Cloning with a soft-edged brush usually produces more natural results.
For details on brushes, see Chapter 12.
3. Choose your desired blend mode and opacity percentage.
For more on blend modes, see Chapter 11. To make your cloned image
appear ghosted, use an opacity percentage of less than 100 percent.
4. Select or deselect the Aligned option.

With Aligned selected, the clone source moves when you move your
cursor to a different location. If you want to clone multiple times from
the same location, leave the Aligned option deselected.
5. Select or deselect the Sample All Layers option.
This option enables you to sample pixels from all visible
layers for the clone. If this option is deselected, the Clone
Stamp tool clones from only the active layer. Check out
Chapter 8 for details about working with layers.
6. Alt+click (Opt+click on the Mac) the area of your image
that you want to clone to define the source of the clone.
7. Click or drag along the area where you want the clone
to appear, as shown in Figure 9-12.
As you drag, Elements displays a crosshair icon along
with your Clone Stamp cursor. The crosshair is the source
you’re cloning from, and the Clone Stamp cursor is where
the clone is being applied. As you move the mouse, the
crosshair moves as well. This provides a continuous ref-
erence to the area of your image that you’re cloning.
Watch the crosshair, or else you may clone something
you don’t want.
If you’re cloning an element, try to clone it without lifting your mouse. Also,
when you’re retouching a flaw, try not to overdo it. One or two clicks on each
flaw is usually plenty. If you’re heavy-handed with the Clone Stamp, you get a
blotchy effect that is a telltale sign that something has been retouched.
You can also clone patterns by using the Pattern Stamp tool, which shares
a flyout menu with the Clone Stamp tool. Select a pattern from the Pattern
Picker drop-down palette on the Options bar. Drag with the tool to clone a
pattern onto your image.
Retouching with the Healing Brush
The Healing Brush tool is similar to the Clone Stamp tool in that you clone
pixels from one area onto another area. But the Healing Brush is superior in
that it takes into account the tonality (highlights, midtones, and shadows) of
the flawed area. The Healing Brush clones by using the texture from the sam-
pled area (the source) and then using the colors around the brush stroke as
you paint over the flawed area (the destination). The highlights, midtones,
and shadow areas remain intact, making the repair more realistic and natural
and not as blotchy or miscolored as with the Clone Stamp tool.

Here are the steps to heal a photo:
1. Open an image in need of a makeover and select the Healing Brush
tool from the Tools palette in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on
the Mac).
You can also heal between two images, but be sure that they have the
same color mode; for example, both RGB. We chose a guy who looks like
he might like to lose a few years, shown in Figure 9-13.
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-13: Wipe out ten years in two minutes with the Healing Brush tool.
2. Specify a diameter and hardness for your brush tip from the Brush
Picker drop-down palette on the Options bar.
You can also adjust the spacing, angle, and roundness. For details on
these options, see Chapter 12. Don’t be shy. Be sure to adjust the size
of your brush as needed. Using the appropriate brush size for the flaw
you’re retouching is critical to creating a realistic effect.
3. Choose your desired blend mode.
For most retouching jobs, you probably should leave the mode as
Normal. Replace mode preserves textures, such as noise or film grain,
around the edges of your strokes.
4. Choose one of these Source options:

• Sampled: Uses the pixels from the image. This is your choice for
the majority of your repairs.
• Pattern: Uses pixels from a pattern chosen from the Pattern Picker
drop-down palette.
5. Select or deselect the Aligned option on the Options bar.
For most retouching tasks, you probably should leave it on Aligned.
• Select Aligned: When you click or drag with the Healing Brush,
Elements displays a crosshair along with the Healing Brush cursor.
The crosshair represents the sampling point, also known as the
source. As you move the Healing Brush tool, the crosshair also
moves, providing a constant reference to the area you’re sampling.
• Deselect Aligned: Elements applies the source pixels from your ini-
tial sampling point, no matter how many times you stop and start
dragging.
6. Select the Sample All Layers option to heal an image using all visible
layers.
If this option is deselected, you heal from only the active layer.
To ensure maximum editing flexibility later on, select the Sample All
Layers option and add a new, blank layer above the image you want to
heal. When you heal the image, the pixels appear on the new layer and
not on the image itself. This enables you to adjust opacity and blend
modes and to make other adjustment to the healed layer.
7. Establish the sampling point by Alt+clicking (Opt+clicking). Make sure
to click the area of your image that you want to clone from.
In our example, we clicked a smooth area of the forehead.
8. Release the Alt key (Opt key on the Mac) and click or drag over a
flawed area of your image.
Keep an eye on the crosshair because that’s the area you’re healing
from. We brushed over the wrinkles under and around the eyes and on
the forehead (refer to Figure 9-13). This guy never looked so good, and
he experienced absolutely no recovery time.
Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush
Whereas the Healing Brush is designed to fix larger flawed areas, the Spot
Healing Brush is great for smaller imperfections. The Spot Healing Brush
doesn’t require you to specify a sampling source. It automatically takes a
sample from around the area to be retouched. It’s quick and easy and often
effective. But it doesn’t give you control over the sampling source, so keep an
eye out for less-than-desirable fixes.
197
Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Here’s how to quickly fix small flaws with the Spot Healing Brush tool:
1. Open your image and grab the Spot Healing Brush tool in Full Edit
mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac).
The moles on this guy’s face, shown in Figure 9-14, are no match for the
Spot Healing Brush.
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-14: Now you see it (left), and now you don’t (right).
2. On the Options bar, click the Brush Preset Picker and select a desired
diameter and hardness for your brush tip from the drop-down palette.
Select a brush that’s a little larger than the flawed area you’re fixing.
3. Choose a blend mode from the Options bar.
As with the Healing Brush, the most likely mode is Normal.
4. Choose a type from the Options bar:
• Proximity Match: Samples the pixels around the edge of the selec-
tion to fix the flawed area.
• Create Texture: Uses all the pixels in the selection to create a tex-
ture to fix the flaw.
Try Proximity Match first, and if it doesn’t work, undo and try Create
Texture.

5. Choose Sample All Layers to heal an image using all visible layers.
If you leave this check box unselected, you heal from only the active layer.
6. Click or drag on the area you want to fix.
We clicked the moles with the Spot Healing Brush. For the wrinkles
around the eyes, we broke out the Healing Brush. We needed more 
control of the sampling source to achieve realistic results.
Lightening and Darkening with 
Dodge and Burn Tools
The techniques of dodging and burning originated in the darkroom, where
photographers fixed negatives that had overly dark or light areas by adding
or subtracting exposure, using holes and paddles as an enlarger made prints.
The Dodge and Burn tools in Elements are even better than their analog ances-
tors in that they’re more flexible and much more precise. In Elements, you
can specify the size and softness of your tool by simply selecting from one of
the many brush tips. You can also limit the correction to various tonal ranges
in your image — shadows, midtones, or highlights. Finally, you can adjust the
amount of correction that’s applied by specifying an exposure percentage.
Use these tools only on small areas, such as the girl’s face shown in Figure 9-15,
and in moderation. Also, keep in mind that you can’t add detail that isn’t
there to begin with. If you try to lighten extremely dark shadows that contain
little detail, you get gray areas. If you try to darken overly light highlights,
you just end up with white blobs.
Figure 9-15: Use the Dodge and Burn tools to lighten and darken small areas.
199
Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Follow these steps to dodge or burn an image:
1. Choose either the Dodge or Burn tool (or press O) from the Tools
palette in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac).
2. Select a brush from the Brush Preset Picker drop-down palette and
also adjust the brush size, if necessary.
Larger, softer brushes spread the dodging or burning effect over a larger
area, making blending with the surrounding area easier.
3. From the Range pop-up list, select Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights.
Select Shadows to darken or lighten the darker areas of your image.
Select Midtones to adjust the tones of average darkness. Select
Highlights to make the light areas lighter or darker.
In Figure 9-15, the original image had mostly dark areas, so we dodged
the shadows.
4. Choose the amount of correction you want to apply with each stroke
by adjusting the Exposure setting on the Options bar.
Start with a lower percentage to better control the amount of darkening
or lightening. Exposure is similar to the opacity setting you use with the
regular Brush tool. We used a setting of 10 percent.
5. Paint over the areas you want to lighten or darken.
6. If you overdo it, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to undo the stroke.
Smudging Away Rough Spots
The Smudge tool, one of the focus tools, pushes your pixels around using the
color that’s under the cursor when you start to drag. Think of it as dragging a
brush through wet paint. You can use this tool to create a variety of effects.
When it’s used to the extreme, you can create a warped effect. When it’s used
more subtly, you can soften the edges of objects in a more natural fashion
than you can with the Blur tool. Or, you can create images that take on a
painterly effect, as shown in Figure 9-16. Keep an eye on your image as you
paint, however, because you can start to eliminate detail and wreak havoc if
you’re not careful with the Smudge tool.
To use the Smudge tool, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Smudge tool from the Tools palette in Full Edit mode
(Standard Edit mode on the Mac).
You can also press the R key (press Shift+R to cycle through the avail-
able focus tools).

2. Select a brush from the Brushes presets drop-down palette.
Use a small brush for smudging tiny areas, such as edges. Larger
brushes produce more extreme effects.
3. Select a blending mode from the Mode pop-up list.
4. Choose the strength of the smudging effect with the Strength slider or
text box.
The lower the value, the lighter the effect.
5. If your image has multiple layers, select Sample All Layers, and
Elements uses pixels from all the visible layers to produce the effect.
The smudge still appears only on the active layer, but the look is a bit
different, depending on the colors of the underlying layers.
6. Use the Finger Painting option to begin the smudge by using the fore-
ground color.
Rather than use the color under your cursor, this option smears your
foreground color at the start of each stroke. If you want the best of both
worlds, you can quickly switch into Finger Painting mode by pressing
the Alt key (Opt key on the Mac) as you drag. Release Alt to go back to
Normal mode.

7. Paint over the areas you want to smudge.
Pay attention to your strokes because this tool can radically change
your image. If you don’t like the results, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac)
to undo and then lower the Strength percentage even more.
Softening with the Blur Tool
The Blur tool can be used for both repair and more artistic endeavors. You
can use the Blur tool to soften a small flaw or part of a rough edge. You can
add a little blur to an element to make it appear as though it were moving
when photographed. You can also blur portions of your image to emphasize
the focal point, as shown in Figure 9-17, where we blurred everything except
the girl’s face. The Blur tool works by decreasing the contrast among adja-
cent pixels in the blurred area.
The mechanics of using the Blur tool and its options are similar to those of
the Smudge tool, described earlier in this chapter. You obviously just don’t
find the Finger Painting option with the Blur tool. When you use the Blur tool,
be sure to use a small brush for smaller areas of blur.

Figure 9-17: The Blur tool can soften just the edges of a larger portion of an image element.

Focusing with the 
Sharpen Tool
If the Blur tool is yin, the Sharpen
tool is yang. The Sharpen tool
increases the contrast among adja-
cent pixels to give the illusion that
things are sharper. This tool needs to
be used with restraint, however.
Sharpen can quickly give way to
overly grainy and noisy images if
you’re not cautious.
Use a light hand and keep the areas
you sharpen small. Sometimes, the
eyes in a soft portrait can benefit
from a little sharpening, as shown in
Figure 9-18. You can also slightly
sharpen an area to emphasize it
against a less-than-sharp background.
To use the Sharpen tool, grab the
tool from the Tools palette and follow the steps provided for the Smudge
tool. In addition, here are some tips for using the Sharpen tool:
 Use a lower value, around 25 percent or less.
 Remember that you want to gradually sharpen your element to avoid
the nasty, noisy grain that can occur from oversharpening.
 Because sharpening increases contrast, if you use other contrast adjust-
ments, such as Levels, you boost the contrast of the sharpened area
even more.
If you need to sharpen your overall image, try choosing either the Enhance➪
Unsharp Mask or Enhance➪Adjust Sharpness feature instead. They offer
more options and better control.
Sponging Color On and Off
The Sponge tool soaks up color or squeezes it out. In more technical terms,
this tool reduces or increases the intensity, or saturation, of color in both
color and grayscale images. Yes, the Sponge tool also works in Grayscale
mode by darkening or lightening the brightness value of those pixels.
As with the Blur and Sharpen tools, you can use the Sponge tool to reduce
or increase the saturation in selected areas in order to draw attention to or
away from those areas.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Follow these steps to sponge color on or off your image:
1. Choose the Sponge tool from the Tools palette in Full Edit mode
(Standard Edit mode on the Mac).
Press the O key or press Shift+O to cycle through the Sponge, Dodge,
and Burn tools.
2. Select a brush from the Brushes presets drop-down palette.
Use large, soft brushes to saturate or desaturate a larger area.
3. Choose either Desaturate or Saturate from the Mode pop-up list to
decrease or increase color intensity, respectively.
4. Choose a flow rate with the Flow slider or text box.
The flow rate is the speed with which the saturation or desaturation
effect builds as you paint.
5. Paint carefully over the areas you want to saturate or desaturate with
color.
In the example shown in Figure 9-19, we saturated one of the kids to
make her more of a focal point and desaturated the others.

Replacing One Color with Another
The Color Replacement tool allows
you to replace the original color of
an image with the foreground color.
You can use this tool in a multitude
of ways:
 Colorize a grayscale image to
create the look of a hand-
painted photo.
 Completely change the color of
an element, or elements, in your
image, as shown in Figure 9-20.
 Eliminate red-eye if other, more
automated methods don’t work
to your satisfaction.
What we particularly like about the
Color Replacement tool is that it pre-
serves all the tones in the image. The
color that’s applied isn’t like the opaque paint that’s applied when you paint
with the Brush tool. When you’re replacing color, the midtones, shadows, and
highlights are retained. The Color Replacement tool works by first sampling
the original colors in the image and then replacing those colors with the fore-
ground color. By specifying different sampling methods, limits, and tolerance
settings, you can control the range of colors that Elements replaces.
Follow these steps to replace existing color with your foreground color:
1. Select the Color Replacement tool from the Tools palette in Full Edit
mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac).
This tool shares a flyout menu with the Brush and Pencil tools.
Alternatively, press the B key (or Shift+B).
2. Specify your desired brush tip diameter and hardness from the Brush
Preset Picker drop-down palette.
3. Choose your desired blend mode. Here’s a brief rundown of 
each one:
• Color: The default, this mode works well for most jobs. This mode
works great in eliminating red-eye.
• Hue: Similar to color, this mode is less intense and provides a sub-
tler effect.
• Saturation: This mode is the one to use to convert your color image
to grayscale. Set your foreground color to Black on the Tools palette.

• Luminosity: This mode, the opposite of Color, doesn’t provide
much of an effect.
4. Choose your sampling method (represented by the icons):
• Continuous: Samples and replaces color continuously as you drag
your mouse.
• Once: Replaces colors only in areas that contain the color you first
sampled when you initially clicked.
• Background Swatch: Replaces colors only in areas containing your
current Background color.
5. Select your limits mode:
• Contiguous: Replaces the color of adjacent pixels containing the
sampled color.
• Discontiguous: Replaces the color of the pixels containing the sam-
pled color, whether or not they’re adjacent.
6. Set your tolerance percentage.
Tolerance refers to a range of color. The higher the value, the broader
range of color that is sampled, and vice versa.
7. Select anti-aliasing.
Anti-aliasing slightly softens the edges of the sampled areas.
8. Click or drag on your image.
The foreground color replaces the original colors of the sampled areas.
In our example (refer to Figure 9-20), we used a black foreground color.

f you’ve tried the quick and easy automatic fixes
on your images and they didn’t quite do the job,
you’ve come to the right place. The great thing
about Elements is that it offers multiple ways and
multiple levels of repairing and enhancing your
images. If an auto fix doesn’t cut it, move on to a
manual fix. If you’re still not happy, you can consider
shooting in Camera Raw format, as long as your
camera can do so. Elements has wonderful Camera
Raw support, enabling you to process your images to
your exact specifications. Chances are that if you can’t find
the tools to correct and repair your images in Elements,
they’re probably beyond salvaging.
With information in Chapter 9 and this chapter at your fingertips, try to
employ some kind of logical workflow when you tackle the correction and
repair of your images:

208
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
1. Crop, straighten, and resize your images, if necessary.
2. After you have the images in their proper physical state, correct the
lighting and establish good tonal range for your shadows, highlights,
and midtones in order to display the greatest detail possible.
Often, just correcting the lighting solves minor color problems. If not,
move on to adjusting the color balance.
3. Eliminate any color casts and adjust the saturation, if necessary.
4. Grab the retouching tools, such as the healing tools and filters, to
retouch any flaws.
5. Sharpen your image if you feel that it could use a boost in clarity and
sharpness.
By following these steps and allocating a few minutes of your time, you
should be able to get all your images in shape to print, post, and share
with family and friends.
Adjusting Lighting
Elements has several simple, manual tools you can use to fix lighting if
the Auto tools, described in Chapter 9, didn’t work or were just too, well,
automatic for you. You’ll find that the manual tools offer more control over
adjusting overall contrast as well as bringing out details in shadow, midtones,
and highlight areas of your images.
Fixing lighting with Shadows/Highlights
The Shadows/Highlights command offers a quick and easy method of correct-
ing over- and underexposed areas. This feature works especially well with
images shot in bright, overhead light or in light coming from the back (backlit).
These images usually suffer from having the subject partially or completely
surrounded in shadows, such as the original image (left) in Figure 10-1.
To use the Shadows/Highlights adjustment, follow these steps:
1. In Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac), choose Enhance➪
Adjust Lighting➪Shadows/Highlights. Make sure that the Preview
check box is selected.
In either Quick Fix or Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac),
when the dialog box appears, the correction is automatically applied in
your preview.
2. If the automatic adjustment doesn’t quite do the job, move the 
sliders (or enter a value) to adjust the amount of correction for 
your shadows (dark areas), highlights (light areas), and midtones 
(middle-toned areas).

Figure 10-1: Correct the lighting in your images with the Shadows/Highlights adjustment.
Remember that you want to try to reveal more detail in the dark and
light areas of your image. If, after you do so, your image still looks like it
needs more correction, add or delete contrast in your midtone areas.
3. Click OK to apply the adjustment and close the dialog box.
If you want to start over, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and click the
Reset button (previously the Cancel button).
Using Brightness/Contrast
Despite its aptly descriptive moniker, the Brightness/Contrast command
doesn’t do a great job of brightening (making an image darker or lighter) or
adding or deleting contrast. Initially, users tend to be drawn to this command
because of its appropriate name and ease of use. But, after users realize its
limitations, they move on to better tools with more controls, such as Shadows/
Highlights and Levels.
The problem with the Brightness/Contrast command is that it applies the
adjustment equally to all areas of your image. For example, you may have a
photo that has some highlights that need darkening but all the midtones and
shadows are perfect. The Brightness slider isn’t smart enough to recognize
Before

Shadows/Highlights command
209
Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity

210
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
that, so when you start to darken the highlights in your image, the midtones
and shadows also become darker. To compensate for the unwanted darken-
ing, you try to adjust the Contrast, which doesn’t fix the problem.
The moral is, if you want to use the Brightness/Contrast command, select
only the areas that need the correction, as shown in Figure 10-2. (For more 
on selections, see Chapter 7.) Then choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Brightness/Contrast.
Figure 10-2: The Brightness/Contrast adjustment is best reserved for correcting selected
areas (left) rather than the entire image (right).
Pinpointing proper contrast with Levels
If you want real horsepower when it comes to correcting the brightness and
contrast (and even the color) in your image, look no further than the Levels
command. Granted, the dialog box is a tad more complex than what you find
with the other lighting and color adjustment commands, but when you under-
stand how it works, it can be downright user-friendly.
You can get a taste of what Levels can do by using Auto Levels, detailed in
Chapter 9. The Levels command, its manual cousin, offers much more control.
And, unlike the primitive Brightness/Contrast control, Levels enables you to
darken or lighten 256 different tones. Keep in mind that Levels can be used on
your entire image, a single layer, or a selected area. You can also apply the
Levels command by using an adjustment layer, as described in Chapter 8.
If you’re serious about image editing, the Levels command is one tool you
want to seriously figure out how to use. Here’s how it works:
1. In Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac), choose Enhance➪
Adjust Lighting➪Levels.

The Levels dialog box appears, displaying a histogram. This graph displays
how the pixels of the image are distributed at each of the 256 available
brightness levels. Shadows are shown on the left side of the histogram,
midtones are in the middle, and highlights are on the right. Note that, in
addition to viewing the histogram of the composite RGB channel (the
entire image), you can view the histogram of just the Red, Green, or Blue
channel by selecting one of them from the Channel drop-down menu.
Although you generally make changes to the entire document by using
the RGB channel, you can apply changes to any one of an image’s com-
ponent color channels by selecting the specific channel in the Channel
pop-up menu. You can also make adjustments to just selected areas,
which can be helpful when one area of your image needs adjusting and
others don’t.
2. In Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac), choose Window➪
Info to open the Info palette.
3. Set the black and white points manually by using the eyedroppers in
the dialog box. Select the White Eyedropper tool and move the cursor
over the image.
4. Look at the Info palette and try to find the lightest white in the image.
Select that point by clicking it.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 using the Black Eyedropper tool and trying to
find the darkest black in the image.
When you set the pure black and pure white points, the remaining pixels
are redistributed between those two points.
You can also reset the white and black points by moving the position of
the white and black triangles on the input sliders (just under the his-
togram). Or, you can enter values in the Input Levels boxes. The three
boxes represent the black, gray, and white triangles, respectively. Use
the numbers 0 to 255 in the white and black boxes.
6. Use the Gray Eyedropper tool to remove any color casts. Select a neu-
tral gray portion of your image, one in which the Info palette shows
equal values of red, green, and blue.
If your image is grayscale, you can’t use the Gray Eyedropper tool.
If you’re not sure where there’s a neutral gray, you can also remove a
color cast by choosing a color channel from the Channel pop-up menu
and doing one of the following:
• Choose the Red channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to
add cyan or to the left to add red.
• Choose the Green channel and drag the midtone slider to the right
to add magenta or to the left to add green.
• Choose the Blue channel and drag the midtone slider to the right
to add yellow or to the left to add blue.
211
Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity

212
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
7. If your image requires it, adjust the output sliders at the bottom of the
Levels dialog box.
Moving the black triangle to the right reduces the contrast in the shad-
ows and lightens the image. Moving the white triangle to the left reduces
the contrast in the highlights and darkens the image.
8. Adjust the midtones (or gamma values) with the gray triangle input
slider.
The default value for gamma is 1.0. Drag the triangle to the left to lighten
midtones, and drag to the right to darken them. You can also enter a value.
9. Click OK to apply your settings and close the dialog box.
Your image should be greatly improved, as shown in Figure 10-3.
Figure 10-3: Improve the contrast of an image with the intelligent Levels command.
When you click the Auto button, Elements applies the same adjustments as
the Auto Levels command, explained in Chapter 9. Note the changes, and
subsequent pixel redistribution, made to the histogram after you click it.
Adjusting Color
Getting the color you want sometimes seems about as attainable as winning
the state lottery. Sometimes, an unexpected color cast (a shift in color) can
be avoided at the shooting stage, for example, by using (or not using, in some
cases) a flash or lens filter. After the fact, you can usually do a pretty good
job of correcting the color with one of the many Elements adjustments.
Occasionally, you may want to change the color of your image to create a cer-
tain special effect. Conversely, you also may want to strip out the color from
your image altogether to create a vintage feel. Remember that all these color
adjustments can be applied to your entire image, a single layer, or just a
selection. Whatever your color needs, they’ll no doubt be met in Elements.

If you shoot your photos in the Camera Raw file format, you can open and fix
your files in the Camera Raw dialog box. Remember that Camera Raw files
haven’t been processed by your camera. You’re in total control of the color
and the exposure. For more on Camera Raw, see Chapter 4.
Removing color casts automatically
If you ever took a photo in an office or classroom and got a funky green tinge
in your image, it was probably the result of the overhead fluorescent lighting.
To eliminate this green color cast, you can apply the Color Cast command. This
feature is designed to adjust the image’s overall color and remove the cast.
Follow these short steps to correct your image:
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color Cast in either Quick
Fix or Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac).
The Remove Color Cast dialog box appears. Move the dialog box to
better view your image.
2. Click an area in your photo that should be white, black, or neutral
gray, as shown in Figure 10-4. In our example, we clicked the sky in
the image on the left.
The colors in the image are adjusted according to the color you choose.
Which color should you choose? The answer depends on the subject
matter of your image. Feel free to experiment. Your adjustment is merely a
preview at this point and isn’t applied until you click OK. If you goof up,
click the Reset button, and your image reverts to its unadjusted state.
3. If you’re satisfied with the adjustment, click OK to accept it and close
the dialog box.

213
Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity

214
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
If the Remove Color Cast command doesn’t cut it, try applying a photo filter
(described in the later section “Adjusting color temperature with photo 
filters”). For example, if your photo has too much green, try applying a
magenta filter.
Adjusting with Hue/Saturation
The Hue/Saturation command enables you to adjust the colors in your image
based on their hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is the color in your image.
Saturation is the intensity, or richness, of that color. And, lightness controls
the brightness value.
Follow these steps to adjust color by using the Hue/Saturation command:
1. In either Quick Fix or Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac),
choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation.
The Hue/Saturation dialog box appears. Be sure to select the Preview
check box so that you can view your adjustments.
2. Select all the colors (Master) from the Edit pop-up menu, or choose
one color to adjust.
3. Drag the slider for one or more of the following attributes to adjust
the colors as described:
• Hue: Shifts all the colors clockwise (drag right) or counterclockwise
(drag left) around the color wheel.
• Saturation: Increases (drag right) or decreases (drag left) the rich-
ness of the colors. Note that dragging all the way to the left gives
you the appearance of a grayscale image.
• Lightness: Increases the brightness values by adding white (drag
right) or decreases the brightness values by adding black (drag left).
The top color bar at the bottom of the dialog box represents the colors
in their order on the color wheel before you make any changes. The
lower color bar displays the colors after you make your adjustments.
When you select an individual color to adjust, sliders appear between
the color bars so that you can define the range of color to be adjusted.
You can select, add, or subtract colors from the range by choosing one
of the Eyedropper tools and clicking in the image.
The Hue/Saturation dialog box also lets you colorize images, a useful
option for creating sepia-colored images.
4. (Optional) Check the Colorize option to change the colors in your
image to a new, single color. Drag the Hue slider to change the color
to your desired hue.

The pure white and black pixels remain unchanged, and the intermedi-
ate gray pixels are colorized.
Use the Hue/Saturation command, with the Colorize option, to create tinted
photos, such as the one shown in Figure 10-5. You can also make selections in
a grayscale image and apply a different tint to each selection. This can be
especially fun with portraits. Tinted images can create vintage or moody feels 
and can transform even mediocre photos into something more special.

Eliminating color with Remove Color
Despite all the talk in this chapter
about color, we realize that there
may be times when you don’t want
any color. With the Element Remove
Color command, you can easily elimi-
nate all the color from an image,
layer, or selection. In Figure 10-6, we
made a selection on the right side of
the image and applied the Remove
Color command. To use this one-step
command, simply choose Enhance➪
Adjust Color➪Remove Color.
Sometimes, stripping away color
with this command can leave your
image flat, or low in contrast. If this is
the case, adjust the contrast using
one of Element’s many lighting fixes
such as Auto Levels, Auto Contrast,
or Levels.
Elements 5.0 introduces the new feature Convert to Black and White, shown
in Figure 10-7. As with the Remove Color command, you can convert to black
and white a selection, a layer, or an entire image. But, rather than just arbi-
trarily strip color as the Remove Color command does, the Convert to Black
and White command enables you to select a conversion method by first
choosing an image style. To further tweak the results, you can move the
Intensity slider to adjust the More or Less thumbnails. Finally, add or sub-
tract colors or contrast by clicking those thumbnails until your grayscale
image looks the way you want. Note that you aren’t really adding color;
you’re simply altering the amount of data in the color channels. For more
information on channels, see Chapter 2.
Switching colors with Replace Color
The Replace Color command enables you to replace designated colors in
your image with other colors. You first select the colors you want to replace
by creating a mask, which is a selection made by designating white (selected),
black (unselected), and gray (partially selected) areas. See Chapter 7 for
more details on masks. You can then adjust the hue and or saturation of
those selected colors.
Figure 10-6: Wash away all color with the
Remove Color command.

Figure 10-7: Change color photos to grayscale ones with the Convert to Black and White 
command.
Follow these steps to get on your way to replacing color:
1. In Quick Fix or Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac),
choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Replace Color.
The Replace Color dialog box appears. Make sure to select the Preview
check box.

2. Choose either Selection or Image:
• Selection: Shows the mask in the Preview window. The unselected
areas are black, partially selected areas are gray, and selected
areas are white.
• Image: Shows the actual image in the Preview window.
3. Click the colors you want to select in either the image or the Preview
window.
4. Press the Shift key and click, or use the plus (+) Eyedropper tool, to
add more colors.
5. Press the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) or use the minus (–)
Eyedropper tool to delete colors.
6. To add colors similar to the ones you select, use the Fuzziness slider
to fine-tune your selection, adding or deleting from the selection
based on the Fuzziness value.
7. Move the Hue and or Saturation sliders to change the color or color
richness, respectively. Move the Lightness slider to lighten or darken
the image.
Be careful to use a light hand (no pun intended) with the Lightness
slider. You can reduce the tonal range too much and end up with a mess.
8. View the result in the Image window. If you’re satisfied, click OK to
apply the settings and close the dialog box.

Correcting with Color Curves
Elements borrowed a much-used feature from Photoshop named Curves.
However, it added the word Color and took away some of its sophistication.
Nevertheless, the Color Curves adjustment attempts to improve the tonal
range in color images by making adjustments to highlights, shadows, and
midtones in each color channel (for more on channels, see Chapter 2).
Try using this command on images where the foreground elements appear
overly dark due to backlighting. Conversely, the adjustment is also designed
to correct images that appear overexposed and washed out.
Here’s how to use this new adjustment on a selection, a layer, or an entire
image:
1. In Quick Fix or Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac),
choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color Curves.
The Adjust Color Curves dialog box appears. Make sure to select the
Preview check box. Move the dialog box to the side so that you can 
view the Image window while making adjustments.
2. Various curve adjustments appear in the Samples area. Click the 
thumbnails to make your desired adjustments while viewing your
image.
3. If you need greater precision, click Advanced Options to display 
additional highlight, brightness, contrast, and shadow adjustment 
sliders, as shown in Figure 10-9. Adjust the sliders as desired.
The graph on the left represents the distribution of tones in your image.
When you first access the Color Curves dialog box, the tonal range of
your image is represented by a straight line. As you drag the sliders, the
straight line is altered and the tonal range is adjusted accordingly.
4. Click OK when you have adjusted the image satisfactorily. To start
over, click the Reset button. Check out Figure 10-10 for before-and-
after images. 
Adjusting skin tones
Occasionally, you may find that the loved ones in your photos have taken
on a rather sickly shade of green, red, or some other non-flesh-colored tone.
To rectify that problem, Elements has a command specifically designed to
adjust the overall color in the image and get skin tones back to a natural
shade.

Figure 10-9: The new Color Curves adjustment provides both basic and 
advanced adjustment controls.
Here’s how to use this feature:
1. Open your image in Quick Fix or Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode
on the Mac), select the Preview check box, and do one or both of the
following:

Figure 10-10: Color Curves improves tonal range in color images.
• Select the layer that needs to be adjusted. If you don’t have any
layers, your entire image is adjusted.
• Select your desired areas of skin that need to be adjusted. Only the
selected areas is adjusted. This is a good way to go if you’re happy
with the color of your other elements and you just want to tweak
the skin tones. For more on selection techniques, see Chapter 7.
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color for Skin Tone.
The Adjust Color for Skin Tone dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 10-11.
3. In the Image window, click the portion of skin that needs to be 
corrected.
The command adjusts the color of the skin tone as well as the color in
the overall image, layer, or selection, depending on what you selected
in Step 1.

• Tan: Adds or removes the amount of brown in the skin.
• Blush: Adds or removes the amount of red in the skin.
• Temperature: Adjusts the overall color of the skin, making it
warmer (right toward red) or cooler (left toward blue).
5. When you’re happy with the correction, click OK to apply the adjust-
ment and close the dialog box.
To start anew, click the Reset button. And, of course, to bail out com-
pletely, click Cancel.
Defringing layers
A telltale sign of haphazardly composited images is selections with fringe. We
don’t mean the cute kind hanging from your leather jacket or upholstery; we
mean the unattractive kind that consists of those background pixels that sur-
round the edges of your selections, as shown in Figure 10-12. Inevitably, when

you move or paste a selection, some of the background pixels are bound to
go along for the ride. These pixels are referred to as a fringe or halo. Luckily,
the new Defringe command replaces
the color of the fringe pixels with the
colors of neighboring pixels that
don’t contain the background color.
In our example, we plucked the boat
out of a white studio background and
placed it on an image of water. Some
of the background pixels were
included in our selection and appear
as a white fringe. When we apply the
Defringe command, those white
fringe pixels are changed to colors of
nearby pixels, such as blue or red, as
shown in Figure 10-12.
Here are the steps to defringe your selection:
1. In Quick Fix or Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac), copy
and paste a selection onto a new or existing layer, or drag and drop a
selection onto a new document.
For more on selections, see Chapter 7.
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Defringe Layer.
The Defringe dialog box appears.
3. Enter a value for the number of pixels that need to be converted.
Try entering 1 or 2 first to see whether that does the trick. If not, you
may need to enter a slightly higher value.

Correcting with Color Variations
Although we give you in this chapter several ways to eliminate color casts 
in an image, now we throw in one more. The Variations command is a 
digital color-correction feature that has been around for years and is largely
unchanged. That’s probably because it’s one of those great features that’s
easy to use and easy to understand, and it works. The command works by
enabling you to make corrections by visually comparing thumbnails of color
variations of your image. You may use this command when you’re not quite
sure what’s wrong with the color or what kind of color cast your image has.

Here’s how to use the Color Variations command:
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Variations in Quick Fix or Full
Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac).
The Color Variations dialog box appears, displaying a preview of your
original image (before) and the corrected image (after), as shown in
Figure 10-13.
2. Select your desired tonal range or color richness (if you’re unsure
which range to select, start with the Midtones):
• Shadows, Midtones, Highlights: Adjusts the dark, middle, or light
areas in the image, respectively.
• Saturation: Adjusts the color intensity or richness, making colors
more intense (saturated) or less intense (desaturated). If your
image is faded from time, be sure to increase the saturation after
you correct any color cast issues.
PhotoSpin
Figure 10-13: Color Variations enables you to visually correct your images by comparing thumbnails.

Usually, just correcting the midtones is enough to get your image’s color
in order, but if it’s not, you can always adjust the shadows and highlights
as well.
3. Specify how much adjustment you want with the Adjust Color slider.
Drag left to decrease the amount of adjustment, and drag right to
increase the amount.
4. If you selected Midtones, Shadows, or Highlights in Step 2, adjust the
color by clicking the various Increase or Decrease (color) buttons.
Click more than once if your initial application wasn’t sufficient to
correct the problem.
Be sure to keep an eye on the After thumbnail, which reflects your cor-
rections as you make them.
5. Click the Darken or Lighten buttons to make the colors a little darker
or lighter.
6. If you selected Saturation in Step 2, click the Less Saturation or More
Saturation buttons.
7. If you make a mistake — or several mistakes, for that matter — click
the Undo button.
The Color Variations dialog box supports multiple levels of undo. If you
botch something, you can always click the Reset Image button to start
again. Keep in mind that you cannot undo the Reset Image command
after you click it. Click Cancel to bail out entirely.
8. To apply your color adjustments and close the dialog box, click OK.
The Color Variations command is a great tool to correct those old, faded,
green- (or some other unwanted color) tinted circa yesteryear photos. Color
Variations allows you to easily correct the color and saturation of these pre-
cious, but damaged, images. Remember to either decrease the offending
color or add the color that’s the opposite of the cast in the image. If it’s too
red, add green and vice versa.
Adjusting color temperature with photo filters
Light has its own color temperature. A photo shot in a higher-color tempera-
ture of light makes an image blue. Conversely, an image shot in a lower-color
temperature makes a photo yellow. In the old days, photographers used to
place colored glass filters in front of their camera lenses to adjust the color
temperature of the light. They did this to either warm up or cool down photos,
or to just add a hint of color for subtle special effects. Elements gives you the
digital version of these filters with the Photo Filter command.
To apply the Photo Filter adjustment, follow these steps:
225
Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity

226
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
1. Choose Filter➪Adjustments➪Photo Filter in Full Edit mode (Standard
Edit mode on the Mac).
The Photo Filter dialog box appears.
Note that you can also apply the photo filter to an individual layer by
creating a photo-filter adjustment layer. For details, see Chapter 8.
2. In the dialog box, select Filter to choose a preset filter from the drop-
down list, or select Color to select your own filter color from the Color
Picker.
Here’s a brief description of each of the preset filters:
• Warming Filter (85), (81), and (LBA): Adjusts the white balance in
an image to make the colors warmer, or more yellow. Filter (81) is
like (85) and (LBA), but is best used for minor adjustments. In our
example in Figure 10-14, we used the Warming Filter (85) to warm
up an overly cool winter shot.
• Cooling Filter (80), (82), and (LBB): Also adjusts the white balance
that’s shown, but instead makes the colors cooler, or bluer. Filter
(82) is like (80) and (LBB), but is designed for slight adjustments.
• Red, Orange, Yellow, and so on: The various color filters adjust the
hue, or color, of a photo. Choose a color filter to try to eliminate a
color cast or to apply a special effect.
Figure 10-14: Apply a Photo Filter to adjust the color temperature of an image.

3. Adjust the Density option to specify the amount of color applied to
your image.
4. Check Preserve Luminosity to prevent the photo filter from darkening
your image.
5. Click OK to apply your filter and close the dialog box.
Mapping your colors
Elements provides some commands referred to as color mappers, which
change the colors in your image by mapping them to other values. The color
mappers are found on the Filter➪Adjustments submenu. Figure 10-15 shows
an example of each command, which is also briefly described in the following
subsections.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Equalize
This mapper first locates the lightest and darkest pixels in the image and
assigns them values of white and black. It then redistributes all the remaining
pixels among the grayscale values. The exact effect depends on your individ-
ual image.
Gradient Map
This command maps the tonal range of an image to the colors of your chosen
gradient. For example, colors such as orange, green, and purple are mapped
to the shadows, highlight, and midtone areas.
Invert
This command reverses all the colors in your image, creating a kind of nega-
tive. Black reverses to white, and colors convert to their complementary
hues (blue goes to yellow, red goes to green, and so on).
Threshold
Threshold makes your image black and white, with all pixels that are
brighter than a value you specify represented as white, and all pixels that
are darker than that value as black. You can change the threshold level to
achieve different high-contrast effects.
The Threshold command can come in handy when you need to clean up
scans of line art, such as hand-drawn sketches, people’s signatures, pages
from a book, or even sheet music. Often, when you scan things on paper, the
slight color from the paper appears as a dull gray background in the scan.
By applying the Threshold command, you can adjust the tones in your image
to black and white and drop out the gray. Simply move the slider to get your
desired balance of white and black areas.
Posterize
This command reduces the number of colors in your image. Choose a value
between 2 and 255 colors. Lower values create an illustrative, poster look,
and higher values produce a more photo-realistic image.
Adjusting Clarity
After your image has the right contrast and color and you fix any flaws, as
described in Chapter 9, you’re ready to finally work on the overall clarity of
that image. Although you may have fixed the nitpicky little blemishes with
the healing tools, if your image suffers from an overall problem like dust,

scratches, or artifacts (blocky pixels or halos), you may need to employ the
help of a filter. After you totally clean up your image, your last chore is to give
it a good sharpening. Why wait until the bitter end to do so? That’s because
sometimes, while you’re improving the contrast and color and getting rid of
flaws, you can reduce the clarity and sharpness of an image. So, you want to
be sure that your image is as soft as it’s going to get before you tackle your
sharpening tasks. On the other hand, also be aware that sharpening itself
increases contrast, so depending on how much of your image you’re sharpen-
ing, you may need to go back and fine-tune it by using the lighting adjustments
described previously in this chapter.
Finally, with all this talk about sharpening, we know that you may find it
strange when we say that you may also need to occasionally blur your image.
Blurring can be done to eliminate unpleasant patterns that occur during
scanning, soften distracting backgrounds to give a better focal point, or even
to create the illusion of motion.
Removing noise, artifacts, dust, and scratches
Surprisingly, the tools you want to use to eliminate junk from your images are
found on the Filter➪Noise filter submenu in Standard Edit mode. With the
exception of the Add Noise filter, the others help to hide noise, dust,
scratches, and artifacts. Here’s the list of junk removers:
 Despeckle: Decreases the contrast, without affecting the edges, to make
the dust in your image less pronounced. You may notice a slight blurring
of your image (that’s what’s hiding the junk), but hopefully the edges are
still sharp.
 Dust & Scratches: As its name says, hides dust and scratches by blur-
ring those areas of your image that contain the nastiness (it looks for
harsh transitions in tone). Specify your desired Radius value, which is
the size of the area to be blurred. Also specify the Threshold value,
which determines how much contrast between pixels must be present
before they are blurred.
Use this filter with restraint because it can obliterate detail and make
your image go from bad to worse.
 Median: Reduces contrast around dust spots. The process the filter
goes through is rather technical, so suffice it to say that the light spots
darken, the dark spots lighten, and the rest of the image isn’t changed.
Specify your desired radius, which is the size of the area to be adjusted.
 Reduce Noise: Designed to remove luminance noise and artifacts from
your images. We used this filter to correct the original image (on the left)
229
Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity

230
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
in Figure 10-16. Luminance noise is grayscale noise that makes images
look overly grainy. Specify these options to reduce the noise in your
image:
• Strength: Specify the amount of noise reduction.
• Preserve Details: A higher percentage preserves edges and details
but reduces the amount of noise that’s removed.
• Reduce Color Noise: Remove random colored pixels.
• Remove JPEG Artifact: Remove the blocks and halos that can occur
from low-quality JPEG compression.
Figure 10-16: Use the Reduce Noise filter to remove noise and artifacts.
Blurring when you need to
It may sound odd that anyone would intentionally want to blur an image. But,
if your photo is overly grainy or suffers from a nasty moiré pattern (described
in the following list), you may need to blur the image to correct the problem.
And, occasionally, you may even want to blur the background of an image to
deemphasize distractions or to make the foreground elements appear
sharper and provide a better focal point.
All the blurring tools are found on the Filter➪Blur menu in Full Edit mode
(Standard Edit mode on the Mac), with the exception of the Blur tool, which
is explained in Chapter 9:
 Average: This one-step filter calculates the average value of the image or
selection and fills the area with that average value. You can use it for
smoothing overly noisy areas in your image.

 Blur: Another one-step filter, this one applies a fixed amount of blurring
to the whole image.
 Blur More: This one-step blur filter gives the same effect as Blur, but
more intensely.
 Motion Blur: This filter mimics the blur given off by moving objects.
Specify the angle of motion and the distance of the blur. Make sure to
select the Preview check box to see the effect as you enter your values.
 Radial Blur: Need to simulate a moving Ferris wheel or some other
round object? This filter produces a circular blur effect. Specify the
amount of blur you want. Choose the Spin method to blur along concen-
tric circular lines, as shown in the thumbnail. Or, choose Zoom to blur
along radial lines and mimic the effect of zooming in to your image.
Specify your desired Quality level. Because the Radial Blur filter is noto-
riously slow, Elements gives you the option of Draft (fast but grainy),
Good, or Best (slower but smoother). The difference between Good and
Best is evident only on larger, higher-resolution images. Finally, indicate
where you want the center of your blur by moving the blur diagram
thumbnail.
 Smart Blur: This filter provides several options to enable you to specify
how the blur is applied. Specify a value for the radius and threshold,
both defined later in this chapter, in the “Sharpening for better focus”
section. Start with a lower value for both and adjust from there. Choose
a quality setting from the pop-up menu. Choose a mode setting. Normal
blurs the entire image or selection. Edge Only blurs only the edges of
your elements and uses black and white in the blurred pixels. Overlay
Edge also blurs just the edges, but it applies only white to the blurred
pixels.
 Gaussian Blur: The last Blur filter we discuss is probably the one you’ll
use most often. It offers a Radius setting to let you adjust the amount of
blurring you desire.
Use the Gaussian Blur filter to camouflage moiré patterns on scanned
images. A moiré pattern is caused when you scan halftone images. A
halftone is created when a continuous tone image, such as a photo, is
digitized and converted into a screen pattern of repeating lines (usually
between 85 and 150 lines per inch) and then printed. When you then
scan that halftone, a second pattern results and is overlaid on the origi-
nal pattern. These two different patterns bump heads and create a nasty
moiré pattern. The Gaussian Blur filter doesn’t eliminate the moiré — 
it simply merges the dots and reduces the appearance of the pattern, 
as shown in Figure 10-17. Play with the Radius slider until you get an
acceptable tradeoff between less moiré and less focus. If you happen to
have a descreen filter built into your scanning software, you can use that
as well during the scanning of the halftone image.

halftones.
Sharpening for better focus
Of course, if your images don’t need any contrast, color, and flaw fixing, feel
free to jump right into sharpening. Sometimes, images captured by a scanner
or a digital camera are a little soft, and it’s not due to any tonal adjustments.
Occasionally, you may even want to sharpen a selected area in your image
just so that it stands out more.
First, let us say that you can’t really improve the focus of an image after it’s
captured. But, you can do a pretty good job of faking it. All sharpening tools
work by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels. This increased con-
trast causes the edges to appear more distinct, thereby giving the illusion
that the focus is improved, as shown in Figure 10-18.
Figure 10-18: Sharpening mimics an increase in focus by increasing contrast between
adjacent pixels.

Elements eliminated the less-than-useful one-step Sharpen filters in favor 
of a new, smarter sharpening command. Thankfully, Elements also retained a
long-time favorite command, Unsharp Mask. Remember that you can also use
the Sharpen tool for small areas, as described in Chapter 9. Here’s a descrip-
tion of the two sharpening commands:
 Unsharp Mask: If you’re looking for this filter on the Filter menu in
Version 5.0, don’t bother. It moved to the Enhance menu with the new
sharpening command. Unsharp Mask, which gets its odd name from a
darkroom technique, is the sharpening tool of choice. It gives you sev-
eral options that enable you to control the amount of sharpening and
the width of the areas to be sharpened. Use them to pinpoint your
desired sharpening:
• Amount: Specify your desired amount (from 1 to 500 percent) of
edge sharpening. The higher the value, the more contrast between
pixels around the edges. Start with a value of 100 percent (or less),
which usually gives good contrast without appearing overly grainy.
• Radius: Specify the width (from .1 to 250 pixels) of the edges that
the filter will sharpen. The higher the value, the wider the edge.
The value you use is largely based on the resolution of your 
image. Low-resolution images require a smaller radius value. 
High-resolution images require a higher value.
Be warned that specifying a value that’s too high overemphasizes
the edges of your image and makes it appear too “contrasty” or
even “goopy” around the edges.
A good guideline in selecting a starting radius value is to divide
your image’s resolution by 150. For example, if you have a 300 ppi
image, set the radius at 2 and then use your eye to adjust from
there.
• Threshold: Specify the difference in brightness (from 0 to 255)
that must be present between adjacent pixels before the edge is
sharpened. A lower value sharpens edges with very little contrast
difference. Higher values sharpen only when adjacent pixels are
very different in contrast. We recommend leaving Threshold set at
0 unless your image is very grainy. Increasing the value too high
can cause unnatural transitions between sharpened and unsharp-
ened areas.
Occasionally, the values you enter for Amount and Radius may sharpen
the image effectively but in turn create excess grain, or noise, in your
image. You can sometimes reduce this noise by increasing the Threshold
value.
233
Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity

234
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 Adjust Sharpness: When you’re looking for precision in your image
sharpening, Unsharp Mask is one option. The new Adjust Sharpness
command, shown in Figure 10-19, is the other. This feature enables you
to control the amount of sharpening applied to shadow and highlight
areas. It also allows you to choose from various sharpening algorithms.
Here are the various options you can specify:
• Amount and Radius: See the two descriptions under the preceding
Unsharp Mask bullet.
• Remove: Choose your sharpening algorithm. Gaussian Blur is the
algorithm used for the Unsharp Mask command. Lens Blur detects
detail in the image and attempts to respect the details while reduc-
ing the nasty halos that can occur with sharpening. Motion Blur
tries to sharpen the blurring that occurs with moving the camera
(or if your subject doesn’t sit still).
• Angle: Specify the direction of motion for the Motion Blur algo-
rithm, described in the preceding Remove bullet.
• More Refined: Runs the algorithm more slowly for better accuracy.

n addition to correcting photos to improve
their appearance, you can delve into the world
of the Photoshop Elements artist, where you can
use tools to draw and paint on existing photos or
create new, blank documents and create your own
drawings. The tools available to you rival an artist’s
analog tools, and Photoshop Elements capabilities
are limited only by your imagination. In this part,
you ﬁnd out how to apply different artistic effects
by using many tools and customizing them for
your own use, and you get some helpful tips to
create some dazzling images.
In addition to describing the artistic effects you
can apply to your photos, this section tells you
how to handle working with text. When it comes
time for creating a poster, an advertisement, or
some Web icons, the text features in Elements
offer you many options for creating headline type,
body copy, and special type effects.

mentation is in order, turn to this chapter as your guide.
Having Fun with Filters
Filters have been around since the early days of digital imaging, when
Photoshop was just a little bitty program. Filters, also called plug-ins because
they can be installed or removed independently, change the look of your image
in a variety of ways, as shown in Figure 11-1. They can correct less-than-perfect

238
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
images by making them appear sharper or by covering up flaws, as described
in Chapter 10. Or, they can enhance your images by making them appear as
though they were painted, tiled, photocopied, or lit by spotlights. Just make
sure to create a backup of your original image if you plan on saving your fil-
tered one. This section gives you the basics on how to apply a filter and gives
you a few filtering tips.
Figure 11-1: Use filters to correct image imperfections or to completely transform them.
Applying filters
You can apply a filter in three ways:
 In either Full Edit (Standard Edit on the Mac) or Quick Fix mode:
From the Filter menu, choose your desired filter category, and then
select a specific filter.
 In Full Edit mode only (Standard Edit on the Mac): Choose Window➪
Artwork and Effects to open the palette. Click the Apply Effects, Filters
and Layer Styles, the middle button at the top of the palette. Select
Filters from the drop-down list in the upper-left corner of the palette.
Select your filter category from the drop-down list in the upper-right
corner of the palette. Double-click the thumbnail of your desired filter
or drag the filter onto your image window.
 In either Full Edit (Standard Edit on the Mac) or Quick Fix mode:
Choose Filter➪Filter Gallery to apply one or more filters in a flexible
editing environment. The Filter Gallery is described later in this chapter.

You cannot apply filters to images that are in Bitmap or Index Color mode.
And, some filters don’t work on images in Grayscale mode. For a refresher on
color modes, see Chapter 3.
Corrective or destructive filters
Although there are no hard and fast rules, most digital-imaging folks classify
filters into two basic categories, corrective and destructive:
 Corrective filters usually fix some kind of image problem. They adjust
color, improve focus, remove dust or artifacts, and so on. Don’t get us
wrong — pixels are still modified. It’s just that the basic appearance of
the image remains the same, albeit hopefully improved. Two of the most
popular corrective filters, Sharpen and Blur, are covered in Chapter 10.
 Destructive filters are used to create some kind of special effect. Pixels
are also modified, but the image may look quite a bit different from its
original. These kinds of filters create effects such as textures, brush
strokes, mosaics, lights, and clouds. They can also distort an image with
waves, spheres, and ripples.
One-step or multistep filters
All corrective and destructive filters are either one-step filters or multistep 
filters. One-step filters have no options and no dialog boxes; select the filter
and watch the magic happen. Multistep filters act almost like mini-applications.
Choose the filter and you’re presented with a dialog box with options to 
specify. The options vary widely depending on the filter, but most come
equipped with at least one option to control the intensity of the filter. A multi-
step filter appears on the menu with an ellipsis following its name, indicating
that a dialog box follows the execution of the command.
Giving a filter an encore
If you like the filter you applied so much that you want to reapply it, to either
the same image or a different one, all you have to do is either press Ctrl+F
(Ô+F on the Mac) or choose the name of the filter from the Filter menu.
Either way, your last filter, with the same settings, is reapplied to your image.
You may want to reapply a filter to make the effect more pronounced. Or, maybe
you want to apply the same filter with the same settings to a series of differ-
ent images. If you want to reapply the filter but need to tweak the settings,
press Ctrl+Alt+F (Ô+Option+F on the Mac), which brings up the last applied
filter’s dialog box.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Fading a filter
Sometimes, you don’t want the full effects of a filter applied to your image.
Sometimes, fading a filter a bit softens the effect and makes it look less 
“computerish.” Here’s what you can do:
1. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
Click OK when the dialog box
appears.
2. Apply your desired filter to the
duplicate layer.
3. Use the blend modes and opac-
ity settings located on the
Layers palette to merge the fil-
tered layer with the original
unfiltered image.
4. (Optional) Using the Eraser
tool, selectively erase portions
of your filtered image to enable
the unfiltered image to show
through.
For example, if you applied a
Gaussian Blur filter to soften a
harshly lit portrait, try erasing
the blurred portion that covers
the subject’s eyes to let the
unblurred eyes of the layer
below show through, as shown
in Figure 11-2. The sharply
focused eyes provide a natural
focal point.
Selectively applying a filter
Up to this point in the book, we have referred to applying filters to your
images. But we use this word rather loosely. You don’t necessarily have
to apply filters to your entire image. You can apply filters to individual
layers, or even to selections. You can often get better effects when you
apply a filter just to a portion of an image or layer. For example, you can blur
a distracting background so that the person in your image gets due attention.
Or, as shown in Figure 11-3, you can apply an Ocean Ripple or Wave filter to
the ocean, leaving your surfer unfiltered to avoid that overly “Photoshopped”
effect.
PhotoSpin
Figure 11-2: Fading a filter allows you to mix
the filtered and unfiltered images.

Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 11-3: Selectively applying a filter can prevent an image from looking overly manipulated.
Exercising a little restraint in applying filters usually produces a more attrac-
tive image.
Working in the Filter Gallery
When you apply a filter, don’t be surprised if you’re presented with a gargan-
tuan dialog box. This editing window, as it’s officially called, is the Filter Gallery.
You can also access it by choosing Filter➪Filter Gallery. In the flexible Filter
Gallery, you can apply multiple filters as well as edit them ad nauseum.
Even when you’re using the Filter Gallery, make a backup copy of your image,
or at least create a duplicate layer, before you apply filters. Filters change the
pixels of an image permanently, and when you exit the Filter Gallery, the fil-
ters that are applied can’t be removed.

Follow these steps to work in the Filter Gallery:
1. Choose Filter➪Filter Gallery in either Full Edit (Standard Edit on the
Mac) or Quick Fix mode.
The Filter Gallery editing window appears, as shown in Figure 11-4.
2. In the center of the editing window, click your desired filter category
folder.
The folder expands and shows the filters in that category. A thumbnail
displays each filter’s effect.
3. Select your desired filter.
You get a large, dynamic preview of your image on the left side of the
dialog box. To preview a different filter, just select it. Use the magnifica-
tion controls to zoom in and out of the preview. To hide the Filter menu
and get a larger preview box, click the arrow to the left of the OK button.

4. Specify any settings associated with the filter.
The preview is updated accordingly.
5. When you’re happy with the results, click OK to apply the filter and
close the editing window.
6. If you want to apply another filter, click the New Effect Layer button
at the bottom of the editing window.
This step duplicates the existing filter.
7. Choose your desired new filter, which then replaces the duplicate in
the Applied Filters area of the dialog box.
Each of the filters you apply is displayed in the lower-right area of the
Filter Gallery dialog box. To delete a filter, select it and click the Delete
Effect Layer button. To edit a filter’s settings, select it from the list and
make any changes. Keep in mind that when you edit a filter’s settings,
the edit may affect the look of any subsequent filters you have applied.
Finally, you can rearrange the order of the applied filters. Doing so
changes the overall effect, however.
8. When you’re completely done, click OK to apply the filters and close
the editing window.
Distorting with the Liquify Filter
The Liquify filter is really much more than a filter. It’s a distortion that allows
you to manipulate an image as though it were warm taffy. You can interac-
tively twist, pull, twirl, pinch, and bloat parts of your image. You can apply
this distortion filter on the entire image, on a layer, or on a selection. This
überfilter comes equipped with a “mega” dialog box with its own set of tools
(on the left) and options (on the right), as shown in Figure 11-5.
Follow these steps to turn your image into a melted Dalí-esque wannabe:
1. Choose Filter➪Distort➪Liquify in either Full Edit (Standard Edit on
the Mac) or Quick Fix mode.
Your image appears in the preview area.
2. Choose your distortion weapon of choice.
You also have a number of tools to help zoom and navigate around your
image window.
Here’s a description of each tool to help you decide. See Figure 11-6 to
get a visual look at the effect of each distortion tool (the letter in paren-
theses is the keyboard shortcut):

• Turbulence (T): Drag to randomly jumble your pixels. Use this tool
to re-create maelstroms of air, fire, and water with clouds, flames,
and waves. Adjust how smooth the effect is by dragging the
Turbulent Jitter slider in the Tool Options area. The higher the
value, the smoother the effect.
• Twirl Clockwise (R) and Twirl Counterclockwise (L): These options
rotate pixels either clockwise or counterclockwise. Place the
cursor in one spot, hold down the mouse button, and watch the
pixels under your brush rotate, or drag the cursor to create a
moving twirl effect.
• Pucker (P): Press and hold or drag to pinch your pixels toward the
center of the area covered by the brush. To reverse the pucker
direction (bloat), press the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) as you
hold or drag.

• Bloat (B): Press and hold or drag to push pixels toward the edge of
the brush area. To reverse the bloat direction (pucker), press the
Alt key (Opt key on the Mac) as you hold or drag.
• Shift Pixels (S): This tool moves pixels to the left when you drag
the tool straight up. Drag down to move pixels to the right. Drag
clockwise to increase the size of the object being distorted. Drag
counterclockwise to decrease the size. To reverse any of the direc-
tions, press Alt (Option on the Mac) as you hold or drag.
• Reflection (M): This tool drags a reversed image of your pixels at a
90-degree angle to the motion of the brush. Hold down the Alt key
to force the reflection in the direction opposite the motion of the
brush. This tool works well for making reflections on water.

• Hand (H): This tool works like the Hand tool on the Elements Tools
palette. Drag with the Hand tool to move the image around the pre-
view window.
• Zoom (Z): This tool, which works like the Zoom tool on the
Elements Tools palette, zooms you in and out (hold down the
Alt key) so that you can better see your distortions. You can also
zoom by selecting a magnification percentage from the pop-up list
in the lower-left corner of the dialog box.
3. Specify your options in the Tool Options area:
• Brush Size: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to
600 pixels to specify the width of your brush.
• Brush Pressure: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to
100 to change the pressure. The higher the pressure, the faster
the distortion effect is applied.
• Turbulent Jitter: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to 100
to adjust the smoothness when you’re using the Turbulence tool.
• Stylus Pressure: If you’re lucky enough to have a graphics tablet and
stylus, click this option to select the pressure of your stylus.
4. Did you get a little carried away? Select the Reconstruct tool (R) and
hold down or drag the mouse on the distorted portions of the image
that you want to reverse or reconstruct.
Note that the reconstruction occurs faster at the center of the brush’s
diameter. To partially reconstruct your image, set a low brush pressure
and watch closely as your mouse drags across the distorted areas.
5. Click OK to apply the distortions and close the dialog box.
However, if you mucked things up and want to start again, click the
Revert button to get your original, unaltered image back. This action
also resets the tools to their previous settings.
Correcting Camera Distortion
Elements 5 has acquired a new member in the Filter family: Correct Camera
Distortion. If you’ve ever tried to capture a looming skyscraper or cathedral
in the lens of your camera, you know that it often involves tilting your camera
and putting your neck in some unnatural position. And then, after all that,
what you end up with is a distorted view of what was an impressive building
in “real life,” as shown with the “before” image on the left in Figure 11-7.
That’s not a problem — now. The Correct Camera Distortion filter fixes the
distorted perspective created by both vertical and horizontal tilting of the
camera. As a bonus, this filter also corrects other kinds of distortions caused
by lens snafus.

Figure 11-7: The Correct Camera Distortion filter fixes distortions caused by camera tilt and lens flaws.
Here’s how to fix all:
1. Choose Filter➪Correct Camera Distortion in either Full Edit (Standard
Edit on the Mac) or Quick Fix mode.
2. In the Correct Camera Distortion dialog box, be sure to select the
Preview option.
3. Specify your correction options:
• Remove Distortion: Corrects lens barrel, which causes your images
to appear spherised or bloated. This can occur when you’re using
wide angle lenses. It also corrects pincushion distortion, which cre-
ates images that appear to be pinched in at the center, a flaw that’s
found in using telephoto or zoom lenses. Slide the slider while
keeping an eye on the preview. Use the handy grid as your guide
for proper alignment.
• Amount: Adjusts the amount of lightening or darkening around the
edges of your photo that you can get sometimes from incorrect
lens shading. Change the width of the adjustment by specifying a
midpoint value. A lower midpoint value affects more of the image.
Then move the Amount slider while viewing the preview.
247
Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More

248
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
• Vertical Perspective: Corrects the distorted perspective created by
tilting the camera up or down. Again, use the grid to assist in your
correction. We used the Vertical Perspective to correct the build-
ing shown in Figure 11-7.
• Horizontal Perspective: Corrects halos and blurs caused by moving
the camera (or if your subject can’t sit still). For better results, set
the angle of movement under the Angle option.
• Angle: Enables you to rotate the image to compensate for tilting
the camera. You may also need to tweak the angle slightly after
correcting the vertical or horizontal perspective.
• Scale: When you correct the perspective on your image, you may
be left with blank areas on your canvas. You can scale your image
up or down to crop into the image and eliminate these “holes.”
Note that scaling up results in interpolating your image up to its
original pixel dimensions. Therefore, if you do this, be sure and
start with an image that has a high enough pixel dimension, or res-
olution, to avoid severe degradation. For more on resolution and
interpolation, see Chapter 3.
• Show Grid: Shows and hides the grid as needed.
• Zoom: Zooms in and out for your desired view.
Dressing Up with Photo and Text Effects
In addition to the multitude of filters at your disposal, Elements also provides
lots of different effects that you can apply to enhance your photos. Note that
some effects automatically create a duplicate of the selected layer, whereas
other effects can work only on flattened images. (See Chapter 8 for details on
layers.) Finally, unlike with filters, you cannot preview how the effect will look
on your image or type, nor do you have any options to specify.
Here are the short steps to follow to apply an effect:
1. Select your desired image layer on the Layers palette. Or, if you’re
applying the effect to just a selection, make the selection before apply-
ing the effect.
2. Choose Window➪Artwork and Effects.
3. Select the Apply Effects, Filters and Layer Styles button at the top of
the palette.
4. Select Photo Effects from the drop-down list in the upper-left area of
the palette.

5. Select your desired category of effects from the drop-down list in the
upper-right area of the palette:
• Show All: Shows all the effects described in this list.
• Frames: Includes effects that enhance the edges of the layer or
selection, as shown in Figure 11-8.
• Image Effects: Includes a wide variety of effects to make your image
appear as though it is snowing, made of lizard skin or neon tubes,
or painted with oil pastels.
6. On the Effects palette, double-click your desired effect or drag the
effect onto the image.
Note that you can view your styles and effects by thumbnails or by list.
To change the view, click More in the upper-right corner of the palette.
PhotoSpin

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Previously lumped with the effects for images, Elements 5 moved the type
effects to its own subpalette. Although the steps for applying text effects
are similar to those for applying photo effects, here are the steps, for good
measure:
1. Create your desired type.
For details on working with type, see Chapter 13.
2. Choose Window➪Artwork and Effects.
3. Click the Add Text to Your Document button at the top of the palette.
4. Select your type layer on the Layers palette and then double-click
your desired text effect.
You can also drag the effect onto the type. Refer to Figure 11-8 to see
some artwork with both image and text effects.
Adding Shadows, Glows, and More
Going hand in hand with filters and effects are layer styles. Also designed to
enhance your image and type layers, layer styles range from simple shadows
and bevels to the more complex styles, such as buttons and patterns. The
wonderful thing about layer styles is that they’re completely nondestructive.
Unlike filters, layer styles don’t change your pixel data. You can edit them or
even delete them if you’re unhappy with the results.
Here are some important facts about layer styles:
 Layer styles can be applied only to layers. Therefore, if all you have in
your image is a background, be sure to convert it to a layer first.
 Layer styles are dynamically linked to the contents of a layer. If you
move or edit the contents of the layers, the results are updated.
 When you apply a layer style to a layer, a starburst symbol appears
next to the layer’s name on the Layers palette. Double-click the star-
burst to bring up the Styles Settings dialog box and perform any editing
that’s necessary to get the look you want.
Applying layer styles
Layer styles are stored in a few different libraries. You can add shadows,
glows, beveled and embossed edges, and more complex styles, such as neon,
plastic, chrome, and various other image effects. A sampling of styles is
shown in Figure 11-9.

PhotoSpin
Figure 11-9: Add dimension by applying shadows, glows, and bevels to your object or type.
Here are the steps to apply a style and a description of each of the style
libraries.
1. Select your desired image or type layer on the Layers palette.
2. Choose Window➪Artwork and Effects.
3. Select Layer Styles from the drop-down list in the upper-left area of
the palette.

Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More

252
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
4. Select your desired library of styles from the drop-down list in the
upper-right area of the palette:
• Bevels: Bevels add a three-dimensional edge on the outside or inside
edges of the contents of a layer, giving the element some dimension.
Emboss styles make elements appear as though they’re raising off
or are punched into the page. You can change the appearance of
these styles depending on the type of bevel chosen. Adjust param-
eters such as the lighting angle, distance (how close the shadow is
to the layer contents), size, bevel direction, and opacity.
• Drop and Inner Shadows: Add a soft drop or inner shadow to a
layer. Choose from the garden-variety shadow or one that includes
noise, neon, or outlines. You can adjust the lighting angle, distance,
size, and opacity as desired.
• Outer and Inner Glows: Add a soft halo that appears on the outside
or inside edges of your layer contents. Adjust the appearance of the
glow by changing the lighting angle, size, and opacity of the glow.
• Visibility: Click Show, Hide, or Ghosted to either display, hide, or
partially show the layer contents. The Layer Style remains fully 
displayed.
• Complex and others: The remaining layer styles are a cornucopia of
different effects ranging from simple glass buttons to the more exotic
effects, such as Groovy and Rose Impressions. You can customize
all these layer styles to a certain extent by adjusting the various
settings, which are similar to those for other styles in this list.
5. On the Layer Styles palette, double-click your desired effect or drag
the effect onto the image.
The style, with its default settings, is applied to the layer. Note that layer
styles are cumulative. You can apply multiple styles — specifically, one
style from each library — to a single layer.
To edit the style’s settings, either double-click the sunburst on the
Layers palette or choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Style Settings.
Working with layer styles
Here are a few last tips for working with layer styles:
 Delete a layer style or styles: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Clear Layer
Style or drag the florin on the Layers palette to the trash can icon.
 Copy and paste layer styles onto other layers: Select the layer contain-
ing the layer style and choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Copy Layer Style.
Select the layer or layers on which you want to apply the effect and
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Paste Layer Style. If it’s easier, you can also
just drag and drop an effect from one layer to another while holding
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac).

 Hide or show layer styles: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Hide All Effects
or Show All Effects.
 Scale a layer style: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Scale Effects. Select
Preview and enter a value between 1 and 1,000 percent. This action
allows you to scale the style without scaling the element.
Mixing It Up with Blend Modes
Elements sports a whopping 23 blend modes. Blend modes affect how colors
interact between layers and also how colors interact when you apply paint
to a layer. Not only do blend modes create interesting effects, but you can
also easily apply, edit, or remove blend modes without touching your image
pixels.
The various blend modes are located on a pop-up menu at the top of your
Layers palette in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac). The best
way to get a feel for the effect of blend modes is not to memorize the descrip-
tions we give you in this section. Instead, grab an image with some layers and
apply each of the blend modes to one or more of the layers to see what hap-
pens. The exact result varies depending on the colors in your image layers.
Combine these blend modes with varying opacity settings and who knows
what amazing images can materialize?
General blend modes
The Normal blend mode needs
no introduction. It’s the one
you probably use the most.
Dissolve is the next one on the
list and, ironically, is probably
the one you use the least. Both
blend modes are illustrated in
Figure 11-10.
 Normal: The default mode
lets each pixel display 
unadjusted.
 Dissolve: This mode can be
seen only on a layer with an
opacity setting of less than
100 percent. It allows some
pixels from lower layers,
which are randomized, to
show through the target (selected) layer.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Darken blend modes
These blend modes produce effects that darken your image in various ways,
as shown in Figure 11-11:
 Darken: Turns lighter pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer
are lighter than those below. If the pixels are darker, they’re unchanged.
 Multiply: Burns the target layer onto the layers underneath, thereby
darkening all colors where they mix. When you’re painting with the
Brush or Pencil tool, each stroke creates a darker color, as though
you’re drawing with markers.
 Color Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer and burns
them with color, creating a contrast effect, like applying a dark dye to
your image.
 Linear Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer by decreas-
ing the brightness. This effect is similar to Multiply, but often makes
parts of your image black.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 11-11: These blend modes darken your image layers.
Lighten blend modes
The lighten blend modes are the opposite of the darken blend modes. All
these blend modes create lightening effects on your image, as shown in
Figure 11-12:
 Lighten: Turns darker pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer
are darker than those below. If the pixels are lighter, they’re unchanged.
This effect is the opposite of Darken.
 Screen: Lightens the target layer where it mixes with the layers under-
neath. This effect is the opposite of Multiply.

 Color Dodge: Lightens the pixels in the layers underneath the target
layer and infuses them with colors from the top layer. This effect is 
similar to applying a bleach to your image.
 Linear Dodge: Lightens the layers underneath the target layer by
increasing the brightness. This effect is similar to Screen but often
makes parts of your image white.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 11-12: These blend modes lighten your image layers.
Lighting blend modes
This group of blend modes plays with the lighting in your layers, as shown in
Figure 11-13:
 Overlay: Overlay multiplies the dark pixels in the target layer and
screens the light pixels in the underlying layers. It also enhances the
contrast and saturation of colors.
 Soft Light: This mode darkens the dark (greater than 50 percent gray)
pixels and lightens the light (less than 50 percent gray) pixels. The effect
is like shining a soft spotlight on the image.
 Hard Light: This mode multiplies the dark (greater than 50 percent
gray) pixels and screens the light (less than 50 percent gray) pixels.
The effect is similar to shining a bright, hard spotlight on the image.
 Vivid Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50 percent
gray, this mode darkens the colors by increasing the contrast. If the
pixels on the top layer are lighter than 50 percent gray, the mode light-
ens the colors by decreasing the contrast.
 Linear Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50 percent
gray, the mode darkens the colors by decreasing the brightness. If the
pixels on the top layer are lighter than 50 percent gray, the mode light-
ens the colors by increasing the brightness.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 Pin Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50 percent gray,
the mode replaces pixels darker than those on the top layer and doesn’t
change lighter pixels. If the pixels on the top layer are lighter than 50
percent gray, the mode replaces the pixels lighter than those on the top
layer, and doesn’t change pixels that are darker. The mode is usually
reserved for special effects.
 Hard Mix: This mode is similar to Vivid Light, but reduces the colors to
a total of eight — cyan, magenta, yellow, black, red, green, blue, and
white. This mode creates a posterized effect.

Inverter blend modes
The Inverter blend modes invert
your colors and tend to produce
some radical effects, as shown in
Figure 11-14:
 Difference: Produces a neg-
ative effect according to the
brightness values on the
top layers. If the pixels on
the top layer are black, no
change occurs in the under-
lying layers. If the pixels on
the top layer are white, the
mode inverts the colors of
the underlying layers.
 Exclusion: Like Difference,
but with less contrast and
saturation. If the pixels on the top layer are black, no change occurs in the
underlying layers. If the pixels on the top layer are white, this mode inverts
the colors of the underlying layers. Medium colors blend to create gray.
HSL blend modes
These blend modes use the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color model to
mix colors, as shown in Figure 11-15:
 Hue: Blends the luminance (brightness) and saturation (intensity of the
color) of the underlying layers with the hue (color) of the top layer.
 Saturation: Blends the luminance and hue of the underlying layers with
the saturation of the top layer.
 Color: Blends the luminance of the underlying layers with the saturation
and hue of the top layer. This mode enables you to paint color while pre-
serving the shadows, highlights, and details of the underlying layers.
The Color mode is a great tool for colorizing images. If you’ve ever
admired those hand-tinted black-and-white photos used in greeting
cards and posters, you can create the same effect fairly easily. First,
make sure that your black-and-white image is in RGB mode so that it can
accept color. Create a new layer on the Layer palette and set it to the
Color blend mode. Grab the Brush tool (with a soft-edged tip), choose
your desired color, and paint over your image. Adjust your opacity to
less than 100 percent to create a softer effect.

 Luminosity: The opposite of Color, this mode blends the hue and 
saturation of the underlying layers with the luminance of the top
layer. This mode also preserves the shadows, highlights, and details
from the top layer and mixes them with the colors of the underlying
layers.

Using Photomerge Panorama
This awesome tool enables you to combine multiple images into a single
panoramic image, as shown in Figure 11-16. From skylines to mountain
ranges, you can take several overlapping shots and stitch them together
into one.
To be successful at merging photos into a panorama, you need to start with
good source files. First of all, make sure that when you shoot your photos,
you overlap your individual images by 15 to 40 percent, but no more than
50 percent. Then, avoid using distortion lenses (such as fish-eye) and your
camera’s zoom setting. Also try to keep the same exposure settings for even
lighting. Lastly, try to stay in the same position and keep your camera at the
same level for each photo. Using a tripod and rotating the head can help you
get shots at the same camera level.
Follow these steps to create a Photomerge Panorama image:
1. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Panorama in Full Edit mode (Standard
Edit mode on the Mac).
Note that you can also select this command in the Organizer.

PhotoSpin
Figure 11-16: Combine multiple images into a single panorama with Photomerge.
2. In the first Photomerge dialog box, select your source files. Click the
Browse button and navigate to where your files are located.
3. After you have selected all applicable images, click OK.
Elements opens and automatically assembles the source files to create
the composite panorama in the work area of the dialog box. If it looks
good, skip to Step 6.
Elements alerts you if it cannot automatically composite your source
files. You then have to assemble the images manually.
4. To manually assemble your panorama, drag the image thumbnails
from the lightbox area onto the work area with the Select Image tool
(the arrow), or simply double-click the lightbox thumbnail to add it to
the composition.
5. Arrange and position your images:
• Position the images by using the Select Image tool.
• Use the Rotate Image tool to make rotations.
• Use the Zoom and Move View tools to help view and navigate
around your panorama.
259
Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
You can also use the Navigator view box to zoom in and out of
your composition by dragging the slider.
• Select the Snap to Image option to enable overlapping images to
automatically snap into place.
6. To adjust the Vanishing Point, first select the Perspective option in the
Settings area. Click your desired image with the Set Vanishing Point tool.
Elements changes the perspective of the composition. By default, Elements
selects the center image as the vanishing point. If necessary, you can
move the other images.
Note that when you select the Perspective setting, Elements links non-
Vanishing Point images to the Vanishing Point image. To break the link,
click the Normal Setting button or separate the images in the work area.
7. Adjust the blending of the composition.
Select the Perspective setting first and then choose Cylindrical Mapping
to reduce the bowed distortion you can get when you add perspective
to your composition.
If you have some color inconsistencies from having photos with different
exposures, select Advanced Blending to blend the different colors and
tones.
Click Preview to view your settings. Click Exit Preview to return to
Edit mode.
8. Select the Keep As Layers option to save each image in the composite
as an individual layer.
9. Click OK to create the panorama.
The file opens as a new Photoshop Elements (.psd) file with a layer
named Photomerge (if you didn’t retain your layers in Step 8).

E
lements is such a deluxe, full-service image editing program that it doesn’t
just stop at giving you tools to select, repair, organize, and share your
images. It figures that you may need to add a swash of color, either
freeform with a brush or pencil or in the form of a geometric or
organic shape. Don’t worry: This drawing and painting busi-
ness isn’t just for those with innate artistic talent. In fact,
Elements gives you plenty of preset brushes and shapes
that you can use. If you can pick a tool and drag your
mouse, you can draw and paint.
Choosing Color
Before you start drawing or painting, you may want
to change your color to something other than the
default black. If you’ve read the earlier chapters in this
book, we’re sure that you checked out the Elements Tools
palette and noticed the two overlapping color swatches at
the bottom of the palette. These two swatches represent two
categories of color: foreground and background. Here’s a quick look at
how they work with different tools:

262
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 When you add type, paint with the Brush tool, or create a shape, you’re
using the foreground color.
 On the background layer of an image, when you erase with the Eraser
tool, or when you increase the size of your canvas, you’re accessing the
background color.
 When you drag with the Gradient tool, as long as your gradient is set to
the default, you’re laying down a blend of color from the foreground to
the background.
Elements gives you three ways to choose your foreground and background
colors: the Color Picker, the Color Swatches, and the Eyedropper tool, which
samples color in an image. In the following sections, we explore each one.
Working with the Color Picker
By default, Elements uses a black foreground color and a white background
color. If you’re experimenting with color and want to go back to the default
color, press the D key. If you want to switch between foreground and back-
ground colors, press the X key. If you want any other color of the rainbow,
click your desired swatch to change either the foreground or background
color. This action transports you to the Color Picker, shown in Figure 12-1.
Figure 12-1: The Color Picker.

Here are the steps to choose your color via the Color Picker:
1. Click either the Foreground or Background color swatch on the Tools
palette.
The Color Picker appears.
2. Drag the color slider or click the color bar to get close to the general
color you desire.
3. Choose the exact color you want by clicking in the large square,
called a color field, on the left.
The circle cursor targets your selected color. The two swatches in the
upper-right corner of the dialog box represent your newly selected color
and the original foreground or background color.
The numeric values on the right side of the dialog box also change
according to the color you selected. If you happen to know the values
of your desired color, you may also enter them in the text boxes.
Remember that RGB values are based on brightness levels, from 0
(black) to 255 (white). You can also enter HSB (Hue, Saturation,
Brightness) values or the hexadecimal formula for Web-safe colors.
When you’re happy with your color, click OK.
Dipping into the Color Swatches palette
Another way Elements enables you to choose
a foreground or background color is by select-
ing a color on the Color Swatches palette.
The Color Swatches palette is a digital version
of the artist’s paint palette. In addition to preset
colors, you can mix and store your own colors for
use now and later. You can have several palettes
for certain types of projects or images. For exam-
ple, you may want a palette of skin tones for
retouching portraits. Choose Window➪Color
Swatches to bring up the palette, shown in
Figure 12-2.
To grab a color from the Color Swatches palette,
just click the color swatch you want. By the way,
it doesn’t matter which tool you have. As soon as
you move the tool over the palette, it temporarily
converts to an eyedropper that samples the color
and makes it your new foreground or background
color.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Although the Color Swatches palette is a breeze to use, here are a few tips to
help you along:
 Change the background color. Either first select the background
swatch on the Tools palette or Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) a swatch.
 Use preset colors. To load a particular preset swatch library, select it
from the Color Swatches palette drop-down list. Elements offers libraries
specific to Web graphics, photo filters, and Windows systems.
 Add a color to the Color Swatches palette. To add a color to the
Swatches palette, choose New Swatch from the More pop-up menu.
Name your swatch and click OK.
 Save swatches. Choose Save Swatches from the More pop-up menu in
the upper-right corner of the palette. We recommend saving the swatch
library in the default Color Swatches folder in the Presets folder. If by
chance this folder doesn’t come up by default, just navigate to the Color
Swatches folder by following this path: Adobe Elements 5.0\Presets\
Color Swatches.
 Load swatches. If you want to load a custom library created by you or
by someone else, choose More➪Load Swatches. In the dialog box, select
your desired library from the Color Swatches folder. The new library is
appended (added) to your current library.
You can also work with swatches by using the Preset Manager. For more
on the Preset Manager, see Chapter 2.
 Delete swatches. To delete a swatch, drag it to the trash can at the
bottom of the palette or Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) the swatch.
 Change the palette’s appearance. Click the More button in the upper-
right corner to choose from Small or Large Thumbnail (swatch squares)
or Small or Large List (swatch squares with a name).
 Replace your current swatch library with a different library. Choose
Replace Swatches from the More pop-up menu. Choose a library from
the Color Swatches folder.
Sampling with the Eyedropper tool
Another way that Elements enables you to choose color is via the Eyedropper
tool. The Eyedropper tool comes in handy when you want to sample an existing
color in an image and use it for another element. For example, you may want
your text to be the same color as the green background in the images shown
in Figure 12-3. We grab the Eyedropper tool (or press I) and click a shade of
green in the background. The tool samples the color and makes it our new
foreground color. We then create the type with our new foreground color.

Figure 12-3: The Eyedropper tool enables you to sample color from your image 
to use with other elements, such as type.
Here are few things to remember when you’re using the Eyedropper tool:
 Sample a new foreground or background color. Obviously, you can
select either the foreground or background swatch on the Tools palette
before you sample a color. But if the foreground color swatch is active,
pressing the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) samples a new background
color, and vice versa.
 Choose a color from any open image. If you have multiple images open,
you can even sample a color from an image that you’re not working on!
 Choose your sample size on the Options bar. You can select the color
of just the single pixel you click (Point Sample), or Elements can average
the colors of the pixels in a 3-x-3- or 5-x-5-pixel area.

 Make colors Web safe. If you right-click your image to bring up the con-
text menu, you have a hidden option: Copy Color As HTML. This option
provides the Web-safe hexadecimal color formula for that sampled color
and copies it to the Clipboard. You can then paste that formula into an
HTML file or grab the Type tool and choose Edit➪Paste to view the for-
mula in your image.
 Toggle between the Eyedropper and other tools. Elements, multitasker
that it is, enables you to temporarily access the Eyedropper tool when
you’re using the Brush, Pencil, Color Replacement, Gradient, Paint
Bucket, Cookie Cutter, or Shape tools. Simply press the Alt key
(Option key on the Mac) to access the Eyedropper. Release the Alt key
(Option key on the Mac) and you’re back to your original tool.
Getting Artsy with the Pencil and Brush Tools
If you’ve read the first part of this chapter and have been thoroughly doused
with every way to choose a color, you probably want to find out how to paint
and draw with that color. The Pencil and Brush tools give you the power to
put your creative abilities to work, and the following sections show you how.
When you use these two tools, you benefit immensely from the use of a 
pressure-sensitive digital drawing tablet. The awkwardness of trying to draw
or paint with a mouse disappears and leaves you with tools that behave
much closer to their analog ancestors.
Drawing with the Pencil tool
Drawing with the Pencil tool creates hard edges.
You can’t get the soft, feathery edges that you can
with the Brush tool. In fact, the edges of a pencil
stroke cannot even be anti-aliased. (For more on
anti-aliasing, see the following section.) Keep in
mind that if you draw anything other than vertical
or horizontal lines, your lines will have some jag-
gies when they’re viewed up close. But hey, don’t
diss the Pencil just yet. Those hard-edged strokes
can be perfect for Web graphics. What’s more, the
Pencil tool can erase itself, and it’s great for digital
sketches, as shown in Figure 12-4.
Follow these steps to become familiar with the
Pencil tool:
1. Select the Pencil tool from the Tools palette.
Illustration credit: Chris Blair
Figure 12-4: The Pencil tool can
be used for digital drawings.

You can also press the N key. By default, the Pencil tool’s brush tip is the
1-pixel brush. Yes, even though the Pencil tip is hard-edged, we still refer
to it as a brush.
2. On the Options bar, choose your desired pencil options, beginning
with a brush preset. Click the arrow and select your desired brush
from the Brush Preset Picker drop-down palette.
To load another preset library, click the Brushes menu at the top of the
palette.
Remember that you aren’t limited to the standard old brush strokes.
Check out the Assorted and Special Effects brushes. You’ll be surprised
at some of the interesting brushes lurking on these palettes. Use them to
create stand-alone images or to enhance your photographic creations.
Access the pop-up menu on the drop-down palette to save, rename, or
delete individual brushes and also save, load, and reset brush libraries.
For more on these operations, see the following section.
3. Choose your brush size.
A preset brush’s pixel diameters are shown as text below a thumbnail
image of the brush shape. If you want to change the size of that brush
tip, drag the Size slider or enter a value.
4. Select a blending mode.
Blend modes alter the way the color you’re applying interacts with the
color on your canvas. You can find more about blend modes in Chapter 11.
5. If you want the background to show through your strokes, adjust the
opacity by dragging the slider or entering an Opacity percentage less
than 100 percent.
The lower the percentage, the more the background images show
through.
Your strokes must be on a separate layer above your images for you to
be able to adjust the opacity and blend modes after you draw them.
For more on layers, see Chapter 8.
6. Select Auto Erase if you want to enable that option.
This option removes portions of your pencil strokes. For example, if
your foreground color is black and your background color is white and
you apply some black strokes, with Auto Erase enabled, you apply white
if you drag back over the black strokes. If you drag over the white back-
ground, you apply black.
7. Click and drag with the mouse to create your freeform lines.
To draw straight lines, click at a starting point, release the mouse
button, and then Shift+click at a second point.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool creates soft-edged strokes. How soft those strokes are depends
on which brush you use. By default, even the hardest brush has a slightly soft
edge because it’s anti-aliased. Remember that anti-aliasing creates a single
row of partially filled pixels along the edges to produce the illusion of a smooth
edge. You can also get even softer brushes, which employ feathering. For details
on feathering, see Chapter 7.
The Brush tool shares most of the options found in the Pencil tool, except
that the Auto Erase feature isn’t available. Here’s the lowdown on the unique
Brush options:
 Airbrush: Click the Airbrush button on the Options bar to apply the
Airbrush mode. In this mode, the longer you hold down the mouse
button, the more paint pumps out of the Brush and the wider the air-
brush effect spreads.
 Tablet Options: If you’re using a pressure-sensitive digital drawing
tablet, check the settings you want the tablet to control, including size,
scatter, opacity, roundness, and hue jitter. The harder you press with the
stylus, the greater the effect of these options.
 More Options: Click the brush
icon to the right of the More
Options label to access the addi-
tional options described in the
following list. These options,
referred to as brush dynamics,
change while you apply your
stroke. See Figure 12-5 for an
example of each one.
• Spacing: The higher the
number, the more space
between marks.
• Fade: The lower the value,
the quicker the stroke
fades. Zero, however, 
creates no fade.
• Hue Jitter: Vary the stroke
between the foreground
and background colors.
The higher the value, the more frequent the variation.
• Hardness: The higher the value, the harder the brush.
• Scatter: The higher the value, the higher the number of brush
marks and the farther apart they are.

Figure 12-5: Change brush options to create a

• Angle: If you have created an oval brush by adjusting the round-
ness (see the next bullet), this option controls the angle of that
oval brush stroke. It’s so much easier to drag the points and the
arrow on the diagram than to “guesstimate” values in the text
boxes.
• Roundness: A setting of 100 percent is totally circular. The lower
the percentage, the more oval your brush becomes.
• Keep These Settings for All Brushes: You can lock in these brush
dynamics by selecting this check box. This ensures that every
brush you choose adopts these settings.
Like the Pencil tool, additional features for the Brush tool appear on the 
pop-up list on the Brush Preset Picker drop-down palette. Here’s a quick
description of each:
 Save Brush: Allows you to save a custom brush as a preset. See the fol-
lowing section for details.
 Rename Brush: Don’t like your brush’s moniker? Change it with this
option.
 Delete Brush: Don’t like your entire brush? Eliminate it with this option.
 Reset Brushes: Reverts your current brush library to the default.
 Save Brushes: Saves custom brushes in a separate library.
 Load Brushes: Loads a preset or custom brush library.
 The display options: Not a single command but rather a set of commands
that enable you to change the way your brush tips are displayed. The
default view is Stroke Thumbnail, which displays the appearance of the
stroke. These commands include Text Only, Small and Large Thumbnail,
and Small and Large List.
You can also manage brush tip libraries by using the Preset Manager. See
Chapter 2 for information on using the Preset Manager.
Creating your own brush
After playing with all the various options, if you really like the Franken-brush
you have created, feel free to save it as a preset that you can access again in
the future. Choose Save Brush from the pop-up menu on the Brush Preset
Picker palette. Name the Brush and click OK. Your new custom brush shows
up at the bottom of the Brush Preset Picker drop-down palette.
There’s one additional way to create a brush. Elements allows you to create
a brush from all or part of your image. The image can be a photograph or
something you have painted or drawn.
269
Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Here’s how to create a brush from your image:
1. Select part of your image with any of the selection tools. If you want
to use the entire image or entire layer, deselect everything.
For more on selections, see Chapter 7.
2. Choose Edit➪Define Brush or Edit➪Define Brush from Selection.
You see one command or the other, depending on what you do in Step 1.
3. Name the brush and click OK.
The new brush shows up at the bottom of your Brush Preset Picker
drop-down palette. Note that your brush is only a grayscale version of
your image. When you use the brush, it automatically applies the color
you have selected as your foreground color, as shown in Figure 12-6.
Digital Vision
Figure 12-6: Create a custom brush from a portion of your image.
Using the Impressionist Brush
In this section, we introduce the Impressionist Brush. This tool is designed
to paint over your photos in a way that makes it look like a fine art painting.
You can set various options that change the style of the brush strokes.
Here’s how to use this artistic brush:
1. Select the Impressionist Brush from the Tools palette.

It looks like a brush with a
curlicue next to it.
2. Set your brush options.
The Brushes, Size, Mode, and
Opacity options are identical to
those found with the Brush tool,
described in “Painting with the
Brush tool,” earlier in this chap-
ter. You can also find some
unique options on the
More Options palette:
• Style: This drop-down list
contains various brush
stroke styles, such as dab
and tight curl.
• Area: Controls the size of
your brush stroke. The
larger the value, the larger
the area covered.
• Tolerance: Controls how
similar color pixels have
to be before they’re
changed by the brush
stroke.
3. Drag on your image and paint
with your brush strokes, as shown in Figure 12-7.
The best way to get a feel for what this tool does is to open your favorite
image, grab the tool, and take it for a test drive.
Filling and Outlining Selections
There may be times when you want to create an element on your canvas that
can’t quite be created with a brush or pencil stroke. Maybe it’s a perfect
circle or five-point star. Elements offers a couple of other ways to create
these objects. If you have a selection, you can fill or stroke that selection to
create that element rather than draw or paint it on. The Fill command adds
a color or a pattern to the entire selection, whereas the Stroke command
applies the color to only the edge of the selection border.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Fill ’er up
You won’t find a Fill tool on the Tools palette. Elements decided to avoid the
overpopulated palette and placed the Fill and Stroke commands on the Edit
menu. Here are the simple steps to fill a selection:
1. Grab the selection tool of your choice and create your selection on a
new layer.
Although you don’t have to create a new layer to make a selection to fill,
we recommend it. That way, if you don’t like the filled selection, you can
delete the layer, and your image or background below it remains safe.
See Chapter 7 for more on selections and Chapter 8 for details on work-
ing with layers.
2. Select either the foreground or background color and then choose a
fill color.
See “Choosing Color,” earlier in this chapter, if you need a refresher.
3. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection.
The Fill Layer dialog box, shown in Figure 12-8, appears.
Figure 12-8: Fill your selection or layer with color or a pattern.
If you want to bypass the Fill dialog box (and the rest of these steps),
you can use these handy keyboard shortcuts instead:
• To fill the selection with the foreground color: Press Alt+Backspace
(Option+Delete on the Mac).
• To fill it with the background color: Press Ctrl+Backspace (Ô+Delete
on the Mac).
4. Choose your desired fill from the Use pop-up menu.

You can select whether to fill with the foreground or background color.
You also can choose Color, Black, 50% Gray, White, or Pattern. If you select
Color, you’re transported to the Color Picker. If you choose Pattern, you
must then choose a pattern from the Custom Pattern drop-down palette.
For more on patterns, see the upcoming section.
If you don’t have an active selection border in your image, the command
says Fill Layer and your entire layer is filled with your color or pattern.
5. In the blending area, you can choose whether to preserve trans-
parency, which enables you to fill the whole selection or only por-
tions of the selection that contain pixels (the nontransparent areas).
Although you can also choose a blend mode (how the fill color interacts
with colors below it) and opacity percentage, we urge you not to adjust
your blend mode and opacity in the Fill Layer dialog box. Make those
adjustments on your layer later, by using the Layer palette commands,
where you have more flexibility for editing.
6. Click OK.
The color or pattern fills the selection.
Outlining with the Stroke command
Stroking a selection enables you to create colored outlines, or borders, of
selections or layers. You can put this border inside or outside the selection
order or centered on it. Here are the steps to stroke a selection:
1. Choose a foreground color and make a selection.
2. Choose Edit➪Stroke (Outline) Selection.
The Stroke dialog box opens.
3. Select your desired settings.
Many settings are the same as those found in the Fill dialog box, as
explained in the preceding section. Here’s a brief rundown of those
options that are unique to strokes:
• Width: Enter a width of 1 to 250 pixels for
the stroke.
• Location: Specify how Elements should
apply the stroke: outside the selection,
inside the selection, or centered on the
selection.
4. Click OK to apply the stroke.
We gave a 30-pixel centered stroke to our
selection, shown in Figure 12-9.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Splashing On Color with the Paint Bucket Tool
The Paint Bucket tool has been a longtime occu-
pant of the Tools palette. This tool, whose icon
looks just like a bucket, behaves like a combina-
tion of the Fill command and the Magic Wand
tool. This means that it makes a selection based
on similarly colored pixels and then immediately
fills that selection with color or a pattern. Just
like the Magic Wand tool, this tool is the most
successful when you have a limited number of
colors, as shown in Figure 12-10.
To use the Paint Bucket tool, simply click inside
the selection you want to fill. Before you click,
however, specify your options:
 Fill: Choose between a fill of the foreground
color or a pattern.
 Pattern: If you choose pattern, select a
preset pattern from the drop-down palette.
For more details on patterns, see the upcoming section.
 Mode: Select a blending mode to change how your fill color interacts
with the color below it.
 Opacity: Adjust the opacity to make your fill more or less transparent.
 Tolerance: Choose a tolerance level that specifies how similar in color a
pixel must be before it’s selected and then filled. The lower the value,
the more similar the color must be. For more on tolerance, see the sec-
tion on the Magic Wand in Chapter 7.
 Anti-alias: Choose this option to smooth the edges between the filled
and unfilled areas.
 Contiguous: If selected, this option selects and fills only pixels that are
touching within your selection. If the option is unselected, pixels are
selected and filled wherever they lie within your image.
 All Layers: This option selects and fills pixels in all layers that are within
your tolerance level.
Working with Multicolored Gradients
If one color isn’t enough for you, you’ll be pleased to know that Elements
enables you to fill a selection or layer with a gradient. A gradient is a blend of
two or more colors that gradually dissolve from one to another. Elements
provides a whole slew of various preset gradients. But creating your own
custom gradient is also fun and easy.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 12-10: The Paint Bucket
tool makes a selection and fills
it at the same time.

Applying a preset gradient
Similar to colors, patterns, and brushes, gradients have a whole slew of pre-
sets that you can apply to your selection and layers. You can also load other
libraries of gradients from the Gradient palette pop-up menu.
Here’s how to apply a preset gradient:
1. Make the selection you want to fill
with a gradient.
We recommend making the selection
on a new layer so that you can edit
the gradient later without harming
the underlying image.
If you don’t make a selection, the gra-
dient is applied to the entire layer or
background.
2. Select the Gradient tool from the
Tools palette or press the G key.
3. On the Options bar, click the 
downward-pointing arrow on the
Gradient Picker drop-down palette
and choose a preset gradient.
Remember that you can choose other
preset libraries from the palette pop-
up menu. Libraries such as Color
Harmonies and Metals contain inter-
esting presets.
4. Choose your desired gradient type
by clicking one of the icons.
See Figure 12-11 for an example of
each type.
5. Choose from the following additional options on the Options bar:
• Mode: Choose a blending mode to change how the color of the gra-
dient interacts with the colors below it.
• Opacity: Choose how opaque or transparent the gradient is.
• Reverse: Reverse the order in which the colors are applied.
• Dither: Add noise, or random information, to produce a smoother
gradient that prints with less banding (weird stripes caused by
printing limitations).
• Transparency: Deselect this option and Elements ignores any trans-
parent areas in the gradient and makes them opaque instead.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
6. Position your gradient cursor
at your desired starting point
within your selection or layer.
7. Drag in any direction to your
desired end point for the 
gradient.
Longer drags result in a subtler
transition between colors,
whereas shorter drags result in
a more abrupt transition. Hold
down the Shift key to restrain
the direction of the gradient to a
45-degree angle.
8. Release the mouse button to
apply the gradient.
We applied an Orange Yellow
radial gradient from the Color
Harmonies 2-preset library to a selection of a sun in Figure 12-12. We
selected the Reverse option and dragged from the center of the sun to
the tip of the top ray.
Customizing gradients
If you can’t find the exact gradient you need, you can easily create your own.
The Gradient Editor lets you create your own, custom gradient, using as many
colors as you want. After you create a custom gradient, you can save it as a
preset to reuse in the future.
Follow these steps to create a custom gradient:
1. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools palette.
2. Click the Edit button on the Options bar.
The Gradient Editor dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12-13.
3. Pick an existing preset to use as the basis for your new gradient.
4. Choose your gradient type, either Solid or Noise, from the pop-up menu.
A Noise gradient contains random colors. Interestingly, each time you
create a Noise gradient, the result is different.
Note that as soon as you start to edit the existing gradient, the name of
the gradient changes to Custom.
Figure 12-12: We filled our sun selection with a
radial Orange Yellow gradient.

Figure 12-13: Use the Gradient Editor to edit and customize gradients.
5. Choose your options for either a Solid or Noise gradient, depending
on what you chose in Step 4.
• If you chose Solid: Adjust the Smoothness percentage to determine
how smoothly one color blends into another.
• If you chose Noise: You can choose which Color Model to use to set
the color range. You can also adjust the Roughness, which affects
how smoothly or abruptly the color transitions from one to another.
Click Restrict Colors to avoid oversaturated colors. The Add
Transparency option adds transparency to random colors. Click the
Randomize button to randomly generate a new gradient. You can
then skip down to Step 15 to finish the gradient-making process.
6. If you’re creating a solid gradient, begin choosing the first color of
your gradient by first clicking the left color stop under the gradient
bar (refer to Figure 12-13).
The triangle on top of the stop turns black to indicate that you’re work-
ing with the starting point of the gradient.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
7. Choose the starting color by double-clicking the left color stop and
selecting a color from the Color Picker.
In the Stops area, you can also click the Color Swatch or choose
Foreground, Background, or User Color from the Color pop-up menu.
If you select color with the Foreground or Background option when you
change either of those colors, the color in the gradient changes automat-
ically for gradients you make. However, when you open the Gradient
Editor again, you can revert to your original foreground or background
color by selecting the User Color option.
8. Select the ending color by clicking the right color stop. Repeat Step 7
to define the color.
9. Change the percentage of the amount of one color versus the other by
moving the starting or ending point’s color stop to the left or right.
Drag the midpoint slider (a diamond icon) to adjust where the colors
mix equally, 50-50.
You can also change the position of the midpoint by typing a value in the
Location box.
10. To add another color, click below the gradient bar at the position you
want to add the color. Define a color in the same way you did in Step 7.
11. Repeat Step 10 to add colors.
12. To add transparency to your gradient, select an opacity stop (refer to
Figure 12-13), and adjust the Opacity slider to specify the amount of
transparency you desire.
By default, a gradient has colors that are 100 percent opaque. You can
fade a gradient to transparency so that the portion of the image under
the gradient shows through.
You can also add additional opacity stops in the same way you add color
stops.
13. Adjust your color and opacity stops and their midpoint sliders to vary
the percentages of each color.
14. You can also redefine any of the colors. To delete a color stop, drag it
up or down off the gradient bar.
15. When you’re done, name your gradient and click the New button.
Your gradient is added to the Presets menu.
After all that work, you may want to consider saving your gradients for later
use. To save a gradient, click the Save button in the Gradient Editor dialog
box. Save the current presets, with your new gradient, under the current
library’s name or a new name altogether. You can then later load that preset
library. You can also manage your gradient presets with the Preset Manager,
explained in Chapter 2.

Working with Patterns
If you’ve ever seen someone wearing leopard-print pants with an argyle
sweater and a plaid blazer, you’re familiar with patterns. Not always pretty
when used without restraint, patterns can be used to occasionally fill selec-
tions or layers. You can also stamp your image by using the Pattern Stamp
tool. You can even retouch by using a pattern with the Healing Brush tool.
Elements offers lots of preset patterns to keep you happy. And, if you’re not,
you can, of course, create your own.
Applying a preset pattern
Although you can apply patterns by using many different tools, this chapter
sticks with applying patterns as fills. To fill a layer or selection with a preset
pattern, follow these steps:
1. Choose the layer or selection you want to fill with a pattern.
Again, we recommend making your selection on a new layer above your
image for more flexible editing later on.
2. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection or Fill Layer and choose Pattern from the
Use drop-down menu.
3. Click the downward-pointing
arrow and select a pattern
from the Custom Pattern drop-
down palette, as shown in
Figure 12-14.
If you don’t see a pattern to
your liking, choose another
preset library by clicking the
palette pop-up menu and choos-
ing another preset library at the
bottom of the submenu.
4. Choose any other fill options
you want to apply, such as
Mode, Opacity, or Preserve
Transparency.
For details on these options, see the section “Filling and Outlining
Selections,” earlier in this chapter.
5. Click OK to fill the layer or selection with the chosen pattern.
Creating a new pattern
You may someday want to create your own pattern. Patterns can be easily
created from any existing photo or painting you create in Elements. You can
279
Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
Figure 12-14: Fill your selection with one of the
many Elements preset patterns.

280
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
even scan your signature or logo, define it as a pattern, and use it with the
Pattern Stamp tool to sign all your work.
To create your own pattern, follow these steps:
1. Open the photographic, painted, or scanned image that contains the
area you want to use as a pattern.
2. Use the Rectangular Marquee tool to select the area you want to con-
vert into a pattern. Make sure that your Feather option is set to 0.
If you don’t make a selection, Elements uses your entire layer as a basis
for the pattern.
3. Choose Edit➪Define Pattern from Selection or Edit➪Define Pattern.
4. Enter a name for your pattern in the Pattern Name dialog box.
Your new pattern now appears in every Pattern palette, wherever it may
lurk in Elements.
In addition to filling your selection with a pattern, you can stamp on a pattern
with the Pattern Stamp tool. For details, see Chapter 9.
Creating Shapes of All Sorts
In this section, we leave the land of pixels and head
into uncharted territory — Vectorville. Before we
discuss the ins and outs of creating shapes, here’s a
little overview that explains the difference between
pixels and vectors:
 Pixel images describe a shape in terms of a
grid of pixels. When you increase the size of a
pixel-based image, it loses quality and begins
to look blocky, mushy, and otherwise nasty.
For more details on resizing pixel-based
images and the ramifications of doing so, see
Chapter 3.
 Vectors describe a shape mathematically.
The shapes comprise paths made up of lines,
curves, and anchor points. Because vector
shapes are math-based, you can resize them
without any loss of quality whatsoever.
In Figure 12-15, you can see both types of images.
Figure 12-15: Elements
images can be vector-based
(top) or pixel-based (bottom).

When you create a shape in Elements, you’re creating a vector-based ele-
ment. Shapes reside on a special kind of layer called, not surprisingly, a
shape layer. Use shapes to create simple logos, Web buttons, and other small
spot illustrations.
Drawing a shape
Elements offers an assortment of shape tools for you to choose from. Follow
these steps to draw a shape in your document:
1. Choose your desired shape tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press the * key and choose the shape tool from the Options
bar. All the following tools have associated geometry options, which are
described in an upcoming section. Here are the tools that are available:
• Rectangle and Ellipse: As with their Marquee counterparts, you can
hold down the Shift key while dragging to produce a square or
circle; hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) to draw the
shape from the center outward.
• Rounded Rectangle: This tool works like the regular Rectangle but
with the addition of a radius value used to round off the corners of
the rectangle.
• Polygon: This tool creates a polygon with a specified number of
sides, from 3 to 100.
• Line: Draw a line with a width from 1 to 1000 pixels. You can also
add arrowheads at either end.
• Custom: Custom is the most varied shape tool. You have numerous
preset custom shapes to choose from. As with any shape, hold down
Shift to constrain proportions or Alt to draw from the center out.
2. Select your desired color from the Color drop-down palette on the
Options bar.
Click the More Colors button to access the Color Picker for additional
color choices.
3. Select a style from the Style drop-down palette.
To jazz up the shape with bevels and other fancy edges, choose a style
from the palette. For more on styles, see Chapter 11.
4. Click the downward-pointing arrow just to the right of the Shape tools
to specify your geometry options.
For detailed explanations on the various geometry options, see the
upcoming sections.

If you chose the Custom Shape tool in Step 1,
click the downward-pointing arrow to access
the drop-down shapes palette and choose
your desired shape. You can access more
preset shape libraries via the pop-up menu at
the top of the palette.
5. Drag in the document to draw the shape you
defined.
The shape appears in the Image window on
its own shape layer. Check out the Layers
palette to see this phenomenon. Figure 12-16
shows our shape, a Japanese hairstyle, which
we add to in the next section.
Drawing multiple shapes
After you create a shape layer, you can draw additional shapes to that layer.
You can add, subtract, overlap, and intersect shapes in exactly the same way
you do with selections (see Chapter 7). Just follow these steps:
1. Select your desired state button on the Options bar. You can choose
from the following options:
• New Shape Layer: Creates your initial shape layer
• Add to Shape Area: Combines and joins
two or more shapes
• Subtract from Shape Area: Subtracts one
shape from another shape
• Intersect Shape Areas: Creates a shape
only from the areas that overlap
• Exclude Overlapping Shape Areas:
Creates a shape only from the areas
that don’t overlap
2. Choose your desired Shape tool and draw
the next shape.
We completed the shape by adding the face,
shown in Figure 12-17.
Specifying geometry options
Geometry options help define how your shapes look. Click the downward-
pointing arrow on the Options bar to access the geometry options described
in the sections that follow.
Figure 12-16: Custom shapes
run the gamut from the
ordinary to the exotic, such
as this hairstyle.

layer by pressing the Shift key.

Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle geometry options
Here are the Geometry options for the rectangle and rounded rectangle
shapes:
 Unconstrained: Enables you to have free reign to draw a rectangle at any
size or shape.
 Square: Constrains the shape to a perfect square.
 Fixed Size: Lets you draw rectangles in fixed sizes, as specified by your
width and height values.
 Proportional: Allows you to define a proportion for the rectangle.
For example, specifying 2W and 1H makes a rectangle twice as wide as
it is high.
 From Center: Enables you to draw from the center out.
 Snap to Pixels: Aligns the shape to the pixels on your screen.
 Radius: For Rounded Rectangles, applies the radius of a circle used to
round off the corners.
Ellipse geometry options
The ellipse shape has the same options that are available for rectangles
except for the Snap to Pixels option. The only differences are that, rather
than be able to create a perfect square, you can create a perfect circle with
the Circle option.
Polygon geometry options
The geometry options for the Polygon shape are as follows:
 Radius: Enter the radius of a circle used to round off the corners of a
polygon when you have the Smooth Corners option selected.
 Smooth Corners: Round off the corners.
 Star: Create an inward-pointing polygon called a star.
 Indent Sides By: Determine the amount the sides indent inward.
 Smooth Indents: Round off the inner corners of indented sides.
 Sides: Specify the number of sides for your polygon or the number of
points for your star.
Line geometry options
The line’s geometry settings include whether to put arrowheads at the start
or end of the line. You can also adjust the width, length, and concavity set-
tings to change the arrowhead shapes.
283
Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting

284
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Custom shape geometry options
The custom shape options are similar to those you find for the other shapes,
but with a couple of unique options:
 Defined Proportions: Draws a shape based on the original proportions
you used when you created it.
 Defined Size: Draws a shape based on its original size when you
created it.
Editing shapes
You can edit shapes you create by using a variety of tools and techniques.
Here’s a list of the things you can do to modify your shapes:
 Select: Choose the Shape Selection tool to move one or more shapes in
their layers. This tool shares a flyout menu with the Shapes tools.
 Move: Choose the Move tool (press V) to move the entire contents of
the shape layer.
 Delete: Select a shape and press Delete to remove it.
 Transform shapes: Choose the Shape Selection tool and select your
shape. Choose Image➪Transform Shape and choose your desired
transformation.
 Change the color: Double-click the thumbnail of the shape layer on the
Layers palette. This action transports you to the Color Picker, where you
can choose a new color.
 Clone a shape: Press Alt (Option on the Mac) and move the shape with
the Move tool.
To convert your vector-based shape into a pixel-based shape, click the
Simplify button on the Options bar or choose Layer➪Simplify Layer.
Note that you cannot edit a shape after you simplify it, except to modify
the pixels.

lthough we spout on in this book about how a picture says a thousand
words, we would be terribly negligent if we didn’t at least give a nod to
the power of the written word as well. You may find that you never need
to go near the type tools. That’s fine. We won’t be offended if you
skip right past this chapter.
Then again, you may have an occasional need to add a
caption or a headline or maybe even a short para-
graph to an image. Although it’s by no means a 
word-processing or even page-layout program,
Elements does give you ample tools for creating,
editing, stylizing, and even distorting type.
Understanding Type Basics
Elements has four type tools. Two of them are for entering
horizontally oriented type, and two are for entering verti-
cally oriented type. Don’t worry about the vertical type tools.
Although you can use them, they’re really designed for the Asian
market, to enter Chinese and Japanese characters. The horizontal and 
vertical type tools are identical in their attributes, so we just cover the two

286
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
horizontal type tools from here on, and, for the sake of simplicity, we just call
them the Type and Type Mask tools:
 Type tool: Use this tool to enter type. This type is created on its own
type layer except when used in Bitmap mode or Indexed Color mode,
neither of which supports layers.
We refer to layers a lot in this chapter, so if your layer knowledge is
rusty, check out Chapter 8.
 Type Mask tool: This tool doesn’t create actual type; instead, it creates
a selection border in the shape of the type you want to enter. The selec-
tion border is added to the active layer. You can do anything with a type
selection that you can do with any other selection.
We also talk more about selections in this chapter; even for more detail
on selections, see Chapter 7.
You can enter text in Elements in two different modes: point type and paragraph
type. Both the Type and Type Mask tools can enter either one. Here’s a brief
description of each one; for the step-by-step process of creating the text, see
the following sections.
 Point type: Use this mode if all you want to enter is a few words or so.
To create point type, select the Type tool, click in your image, and, well,
type. The text appears as you type and continues to grow. In fact, it even
continues past the boundary of your image! Remember that point type
never wraps around to a new line. To wrap to the next line, you must
press Enter (Return on the Mac).
 Paragraph type: Use this mode to enter longer chunks of text on an
image. To create paragraph type, click and drag your type tool to create
a text bounding box and then type. All the text is entered in this resizable
bounding box. If a line of text is too long, Elements automatically wraps
it around to the next line.
Elements is capable of displaying and printing type in two different formats.
Each format has its pros and cons, and which format you use depends on
your needs. Here’s the lowdown on each one:
 Vector type: All text in Elements is initially created as vector type. Vector
type provides scalable outlines that you can resize without producing
jaggy edges in the diagonal strokes. Vector type remains fully editable
and always prints with optimum quality, appearing crisp and clean.
Vector type is the default type format in Elements.

 Raster type: When Elements converts vector type into pixels, the text is
rasterized. Elements refers to this rasterization process as simplifying.
When text is simplified, it’s no longer editable but is converted into a
raster image. You usually simplify your vector type when you want to
apply filters to the type to produce a special effect or when you want to
merge the type with the image. You can’t resize simplified type without
losing some quality or risking jagged edges. For more details, see the
section “Simplifying Type,” later in this chapter.
Creating Point Type
The majority of your type entry will most likely be in point type mode. Point
type is useful for short chunks of text, like headlines, labels, logos, and head-
ings for Web pages.
Point type is so called because it’s preceded by a single anchor point.
Remember that point type lines don’t wrap automatically, as shown in
Figure 13-1.
Figure 13-1: Point type doesn’t wrap automatically, but instead can run off your image into a
type Neverland.
Follow these steps to create point type:
1. Open an image or create a new, blank Elements file.
2. Select the Type tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press the T key.
3. On the image, click where you want to insert your text.
Your cursor is called an I-beam. When you click, you make an insertion
point.
287
Chapter 13: Working with Type

288
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
A small, horizontal line about one-third of the way up the I-beam shows
the baseline (the line on which the text sits) for horizontal type.
4. Specify your type options from the Options bar.
All the options are described in detail in the section “Specifying Type
Options,” later in this chapter.
5. Type your text. Press Enter (Return on the Mac) to begin a new line.
When you press Enter (Return on the Mac), you insert a hard return that
doesn’t move.
6. When you finish entering the text, click the Commit button (the check-
mark icon) on the Options bar.
You can also commit the type by pressing Enter on the numeric keypad
or by clicking any other tool on the Tools palette. A new type layer with
your text is created. Type layers appear on your Layers palette and are
indicated by the T icon.
Creating Paragraph Type
If you have larger chunks of text, it’s more practical to enter the text as 
paragraph type. Entering paragraph type is similar to entering text in a 
word-processing or page-layout program, except that it’s contained inside
a bounding box. As you type and come to the end of the bounding box,
Elements automatically wraps the text to the next line.
To enter paragraph type, follow these steps:
1. Open an image or create a new, blank Elements file.
2. Select the Type tool from the Tools palette or press the T key.
3. On the image, insert and size the bounding box by using one of two
methods:
• Drag to create a bounding box close to your desired size. After you
release the mouse button, you can drag any of the handles at the
corners and sides of the box to resize the box.
• Hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and click the
image. The Paragraph Text Size dialog box appears. Enter the exact
dimensions of your desired bounding box. When you click OK,
your specified box appears, complete with handles for resizing
later, if necessary.
4. Specify your type options from the Options bar.

Options are described in detail in the following section.
5. Enter your text. To start a new paragraph, press Enter (Return on
the Mac).
Each line wraps around to fit inside the bounding box, as you can see in
Figure 13-2.
If you type more text than can squeeze into the text box, an overflow
icon appears. Just resize the text box by dragging any of the bounding
box handles.
6. Click the Commit button (the check-mark icon) on the Options bar or
press Enter on the numeric keypad.
Elements creates a new type layer.
Figure 13-2: Paragraph type automatically wraps to fit within your bounding box.
Specifying Type Options
You can find several character and paragraph type settings on the Options
bar, shown in Figure 13-3. Although you can’t use some of the more special-
ized options, such as small caps and superscript, you do have access to the
most commonly used options, and they should be more than sufficient if all
you want to do is pair a small amount of type with your images.
289
Chapter 13: Working with Type

290
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Figure 13-3: Specify your type options, such as font family and size, before you type.
Here’s an explanation of each available option on the Options bar, from left
to right:
 Type tools: You can choose your type tool flavor from the Options bar
as well as from the Tools palette.
 Font family: Select the font you want from the drop-down list. Elements
provides a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) font menu. After
each font name, the word Sample is rendered in the actual font — no
more selecting a font without knowing what it really looks like. You also
find one of these abbreviations before each font name to let you know
what type of font it is:
• a for Adobe Type 1 (PostScript) fonts
• TT for TrueType fonts
• O for OpenType fonts

Fonts with no abbreviation are bitmapped fonts.
 Font style: Some font families have additional styles, such as light or
condensed. Only the styles available for a particular font appear in the
list. This is also now a WYSIWYG menu.
 Font size: Select your type size from the drop-down list or just type
a size in the text box. Note that type size is most commonly mea-
sured in points (72 points equals about 1 inch at a resolution of
72 ppi). You can switch to millimeters or pixels by choosing Edit➪
Preferences➪Units and Rulers (Elements➪Preferences➪Units 
and Rulers on the Mac).
 Anti-aliasing: Select Anti-aliasing to slightly smooth out the edges
of your text. Anti-aliasing softens that edge by 1 pixel, as shown in
Figure 13-4. For the most part, you want to keep this option turned on.
The one occasion in which you may want it turned off is when you’re
creating small type to be displayed on-screen, such as on Web pages.
The soft edges can sometimes be tough to read easily.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 Faux Bold: Use this option to create a fake bold style when a real bold
style (which you would choose under Font Style) doesn’t exist. Be warned
that although the sky won’t fall, applying faux styles can distort the pro-
portions of a font. You should use fonts with real styles, and if they don’t
exist — oh, well.
 Faux Italic: This option creates a phony italic style and carries the same
warning as the Faux Bold option.
 Underline: This setting obviously underlines your type, like this.
 Strikethrough: Choose this option to apply a strikethrough style to
your text.
 Text alignment: These three options align your horizontal text on the left
or right or in the center. If you happen to have vertical text, these options
rotate 90 degrees clockwise and change into Top, Center Vertical, and
Bottom settings.
 Leading: Leading (pronounced “ledding”) is the amount of space
between the baselines of lines of type. A baseline is the imaginary line on
which a line of type sits. You can choose Auto Leading or specify the
amount of leading to apply. When you choose Auto Leading, Elements
uses a value of 120 percent of your type point size. Therefore, 10-point
type gets 12 points of leading. Elements adds that extra 20 percent so
that the bottoms of the lowest letters don’t crash into the tops of the
tallest letters on the line below them.
 Text Color: Click the color swatch to select a color for your type
from the Color Picker. You can also choose a color from the Swatches
palette.
 Style: Click this option to access a drop-down palette of preset styles
that you can apply to your type. For more on this option and the Create
Warped Text option (described next), see “Stylizing and Warping Type,”
later in this chapter.
 Create Warped Text: This fun option lets you distort type in more than a
dozen ways.
 Change the Text Orientation: Select your type layer and then click this
option to switch between vertical and horizontal type orientations.
 Cancel: Click this button (or press Esc) to cancel and keep the type from
being entered. You use this option, and the Commit option, only after
you have clicked the type tool on your canvas.
 Commit: Click this button to apply the type to your canvas.

Editing Text
If you have read the first part of this chapter and slogged with us through all
the available options for type in Elements, just remember that you can apply
these settings either before or after you enter your text. To correct typos, add
and delete type, or change any of the type options, simply follow these steps:
1. Select the Type tool from the Tools palette.
2. Select your desired type layer on the Layers palette or click within the
text to automatically select the type layer.
3. Do one of the following:
• To change the font family, size, color, or other type option: If you
want to change all the text, simply select that type layer on the
Layers palette. To select only portions of the text, highlight the
text by dragging across it with the I-beam of the Type tool.
• To delete text: Highlight the text by dragging across it with the 
I-beam of the Type tool. Then press the Backspace key.
• To add text: Make an insertion point by clicking your I-beam within
the line of text. Then type your new text.
4. When you’re done editing your text, click the Commit button.
You may also occasionally need to transform your text. To do so, make sure
that the type layer is selected on the Layers palette. Then choose Image➪
Transform➪Free Transform. Grab a handle on the bounding box and drag to
rotate or scale. Press Ctrl and drag a handle to distort. When you’re done,
double-click inside the bounding box to commit the transformation. For more
details on transformations, see Chapter 9.
Simplifying Type
As we explain in the section “Understanding Type Basics,” at the beginning
of this chapter, Elements can display and print type in two different formats:
vector and raster. Remember that as long as you keep type in a vector format
in a type layer, you can edit and resize that type all day long.
Occasionally, however, you may find the need to simplify your type — to con-
vert your type into pixels. After they’re simplified, you can apply filters, paint
on the type, and apply gradients and patterns. If you’re working with layers
293
Chapter 13: Working with Type

294
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
and you flatten your image (merge your layers into a single background
image), your type layer is also simplified and merged with the other pixels in
your image. By the way, if you try to apply a filter to a type layer, Elements
barks at you that the type layer must be simplified before proceeding and
gives you the opportunity to click OK (if you want to simplify) or Cancel.
To simplify your type, select the
type layer on the Layers palette
and choose Layer➪Simplify Layer.
Your type layer is then converted
(the T icon disappears) into a regu-
lar layer on which your type is now
displayed as pixels against a trans-
parent background, as shown in
Figure 13-5.
To avoid re-creating your type
from scratch, be sure to make all
necessary edits before simplifying.
This includes sizing your text.
After you simplify your type, you
cannot resize your text without
risking the dreaded jaggies. The
other downside to remember
about simplified type is that
although it looks identical to vector type on-screen, it never prints as crisply
and cleanly as vector type. Even at higher-resolution settings, a slight jagged
edge always appears on simplified type. So, if you’re experimenting with
painting or filters on your type, just make a duplicate of your type layer
before simplifying it and then hide that layer.
Masking with Type
Using the Type Mask tool epitomizes the combination of type and image.
Unlike its conventional cousin, the Type Mask tool doesn’t create a new layer.
Instead, it creates a selection on the active layer. This is the tool of choice for
filling text with an image or cutting text out of an image so that the back-
ground shows through, as shown in Figure 13-6.
A selection is a selection, no matter how it was created. So, even though
they look like letters, they act like selections. You can move, modify, and
save them.

295
Chapter 13: Working with Type

296
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Here are the steps to create a type mask:
1. Open the image of your choice.
We selected a stone texture.
2. Convert your background into a layer by double-clicking the word
Background on the Layers palette. Click OK.
This step enables you to jazz up the type with styles later on.
3. Choose the Horizontal Type Mask tool from the Tools palette and then
click the image where you want your text.
4. Specify your type options, such as font family, style, and size, on the
Options bar.
5. Type your desired text. When you’re done, click the Commit button
on the Options bar.
A selection border in the shape of your type appears on your image.
6. Choose Select➪Inverse, which deselects your letter selections and
selects everything else.
7. Press the Backspace (Delete on the Mac) key to delete everything out-
side your selection border.
Your type is now filled with your image.
8. Choose Select➪Deselect.
9. Experiment with applying layer styles to your type.
If the Layer Styles palette isn’t visible, choose Window➪Styles and
Effects. Select the Apply Effects, Filters, and Layer Styles button selected
in the palette. Select Layer Styles from the drop-down list on the palette.
Choose the style you want. We used a drop shadow and an inner bevel in
Figure 13-7. You can find more details about layer styles in Chapter 11.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 13-7: Fill type with imagery by using the Type Mask tool.

If you want to admire your type against a solid background, as we did,
create a new layer and then choose Edit➪Fill Layer and choose your
desired color from the Use drop-down menu.
Stylizing and Warping Type
If you tried your hand at creating a type mask in the preceding section, you
know that Elements is capable of much more than just throwing a few black
letters at the bottom of your image. With a few clicks here and there, you can
warp, distort, enhance, and stylize your type. If you’re not careful, your cre-
ative typography can outshine your image.
Adjusting type opacity
If you checked out Chapter 8
before reading this chapter,
you know that layers are a digi-
tal version of the old analog
transparency sheets. You can
change the opacity of elements
on layers to enable the under-
lying layer to show through in
varying degrees. This is also
possible on a type layer. Peek
at Figure 13-8 to see how vary-
ing the percentage of opacity of
our type layer makes more of
the underlying layer of water
show through.
To change the opacity of a type
layer, simply select the layer
on the Layers palette, click the
arrow to the right of the
Opacity setting, and drag the
slider. The lower the percentage, the less opaque the type (and the more the
underlying layer shows through).
Applying filters to your type
One of the most interesting things you can do with type in Elements that you
can’t do in a word-processing or page-layout program is apply special effects,
such as filters. You can make type look like it’s on fire, underwater, or on the
move, as shown in Figure 13-9, where we applied a motion blur. The only
caveat, as we mention earlier, is that type has to be simplified first before a
filter can be applied. Be sure to do all your text editing before you get to the

filtering stage. Applying the filter is as easy as just selecting the simplified
type layer on the Layers palette and choosing a filter from the Filter menu.
For more on filters, see Chapter 11.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 13-9: Applying a motion blur to type can make it appear as fast as the car.
Painting your type with color and gradients
Changing the color of text is as easy as highlighting it and selecting a color
from the Color Picker. But what if you want to do something a little more
unconventional, like apply brush strokes of paint randomly across the type,
like we did in the first image shown in Figure 13-10? It’s really easier than it
looks. Again, as with applying filters to text, the only criterion is that the type
has to be simplified first. After that’s done, choose a color, grab the Brush
tool with settings of your choice, and paint. In our example, we used the
Granite Flow brush, found in the Special Effect Brushes presets. We used a
diameter of 39, 15, and 6 pixels and just swiped our type a few times.
Figure 13-10: Bring your type to life with color (left) or a gradient (right).

If you want the color or gradient to be confined to only the type area, you
can select the text by either Ctrl+clicking (Ô+clicking on the Mac) the layer
containing the text or locking the transparency of the layer on the Layers
palette.
You can also apply a gradient to your type. Here are the steps to follow after
simplifying your type:
1. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools palette.
2. On the Options bar, click the downward-pointing arrow next to the
Gradient Picker to access the Gradient Picker drop-down palette.
3. Choose your desired gradient.
If you want to create a custom gradient, find out how in Chapter 12.
4. Position your gradient cursor on the text where you want your gradi-
ent to start and drag to where you want your gradient to end.
Don’t like the results? Drag again until you get the look you want.
Remember that you can drag at any angle and to any length, even out-
side your type. In the second image shown in Figure 13-10, we used the
copper gradient and just dragged from the top of the letters to the
bottom.
Warping your type
If horizontal or vertical text is just way too regimented for you, try out some
of the distortions you can apply to your type with the Warp feature. The best
part about the distortions you apply to the type is that the text remains fully
editable. This feature is fun and easy to use. Click the Create Warped Text
button at the far right end of the Options bar. (It’s the T with a curved line
under it.) This action opens the Warp Text dialog box, where you find a vast
array of distortions on the Style pop-up menu with descriptive names like
Bulge, Inflate, and Squeeze.
After selecting a warp style, you can adjust the orientation, amount of
bend, and degree of distortion by dragging the sliders. The Bend setting
affects the amount of warp, and the Horizontal and Vertical Distortions
apply perspective to that warp. Luckily, you can also view the results as
you adjust. We could give you technical explanations of these adjustments,
but the best way to see what they do is to just play with them. See
Figure 13-11 to get a quick look at a few of the warp styles. The names
speak for themselves.

egardless of whether you read much of what
is contained in the ﬁrst four parts of this
book, this last part ﬁnishes up with photo output
and deployment. As is the case with so many
other editing features, you have an abundance of
opportunities for outputting your ﬁles. Beginning
with the most familiar method, which is simply
printing to your desktop color printer, we talk
about how to get the best results on your printed
images. We start with printing to your personal
desktop printer and then cover issues related to
submitting photos to commercial photo labs and
service centers.
In addition to printing, you have a number of dif-
ferent options for sharing images, and they’re all
covered in the ﬁnal chapters, where you ﬁnd out
about slide shows and videodiscs and about Web
hosting, e-mailing, and sharing via online services.
The opportunities are enormous, and you’ll want
to look over all that Photoshop Elements has to
offer related to photo output and ﬁle sharing.

erhaps the greatest challenge to individuals using programs like
Photoshop Elements, and even the professionals who use its
granddaddy, Adobe Photoshop, is getting what you see on your
monitor to render a reasonable facsimile on a printed page.
You can find all sorts of books on color printing — how
to get color right, how to calibrate your equipment,
and how to create and use color profiles — all for the
purpose of getting a good match between your 
computer monitor and your printer. It’s downright
discouraging to spend a lot of time tweaking an image
so that all the brilliant blue colors jump out of your
computer monitor only to find that all those blues
turn to murky purples when the photo is printed.
If you already read Chapters 2 and 3, you’re ahead of
the game because you know a little bit about color man-
agement, color profiles, and printer resolutions. After you
check out those chapters, your next step is to get to know
your printer or your print service center and understand how to
correctly print your pictures.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
In this chapter, we talk about options — many options — for setting print
attributes for printing to your own color printer, and we toss in some tips on
how to get better results when you’re using print service centers. If you need
to, reread this chapter a few times just to be certain that you understand the
process for printing good-quality images. A little time spent here will, we
hope, save you some headaches down the road.
Getting Pictures Ready for Printing
The first step toward getting your photos to your desktop printer or to a
printing service is to prepare each image for optimum output. You have 
several considerations when you’re preparing files, including the ones in
this list:
 Set resolution and size. Before you print a file, use the Image Size dialog
box (Image➪Resize➪Image Size) to set your image size and the optimum
resolution for your printer. Files that have too much resolution can print
images that are inferior to files optimized for a printer. See your printer’s
documentation for recommendations for resolution. As a general rule,
300 ppi (pixels per inch) works best for most printers printing on high-
quality papers. If you print on plain paper, you may find that lower 
resolutions work just as well.
 Make all brightness and color corrections before printing. It stands
to reason that you want to make sure that your pictures appear their
best before sending them off to your printer. If you have your monitor
properly calibrated, as we discuss in Chapter 3, you should see a
fair representation of what your pictures will look like before you
print them.
 Decide how color will be managed before you print. You can color-
manage output to your printer in three ways, as we discuss in the next
section. Know your printer’s profiles and how to use them before you
start to print your files.
Working with Color Printer Profiles
In Chapter 2, we talk about creating color profiles for your monitor and
selecting a color workspace. The final leg in a color-managed workflow is to
convert color from your color workspace profile to your printer’s color pro-
file. Basically, this conversion means that the colors you see on your monitor
in your current workspace are accurately converted to the color that can be
reproduced by your printer. To print accurate color, you need to have a color
profile used by your printer at print time.

Understanding how Elements uses color profiles
You can manage color in Photoshop Elements in three ways when it comes
time to print your files:
 Let the printer driver determine color. This method permits your
printer to decide which profile is used when your photo is printed to
your desktop color printer. Your printer makes this decision according
to the paper you select as the source paper used to print your photos. 
If you choose Epson Premium Glossy Photo Paper, for example, your
printer chooses the profile that goes along with that particular paper. If
you choose another paper, your printer chooses a different color profile.
This method is all automatic, and color profile selection is made when
you print your file.
 Choose a specific profile. In the Elements Print dialog box, a list of color
profiles appears on the Printer Profile drop-down menu. Many printers
install individual color profiles at the time the software for your printer
is installed. You can choose to select a profile at print time.
 Print files with converted color. Also on the Printer Profile drop-down
menu is the Same As Source choice. You use this option if your file has
been converted to a printer profile.
Each of these three options requires you to make some kind of choice about
how color is managed. You make choices (as we discuss later in this chapter,
when we walk you through the steps for printing) about whether to color-
manage your output. These selections are all unique to the Print dialog box
for your individual printer.
Converting color to a printer profile
The third option in the previous section mentions printing a file with con-
verted color. If you choose one of the first two options for converting color
(either you select a profile or you let the printer select one), the image on
your monitor doesn’t change. The conversion happens at print time.
You can physically convert the color in your image to a given printer profile
and doing so actually shows you how the color is converted before you print
your file. In a way, you’re proofing color before wasting paper and ink. If you
want to print files with accurate color, we recommend using this method.
Converting from your color workspace (remember that the workspaces are
either sRGB or Adobe RGB) is handled differently in Windows and on the
Mac. In the following sections, we first point out how to use a third-party tool
in Windows to convert color and then later talk about using an AppleScript
on the Mac that Mac users get free with their OS X installation.
305
Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Using third-party tools for converting color (Windows)
In Windows you can download a free utility from Dry Creek Photo (www.
drycreekphoto.com) that converts color from a workspace to a color pro-
file. Suppose that you want to print some pictures at a discount store like
Costco and you want to be certain to use the correct profile for the photo
equipment that prints your pictures. You want to convert color from your
color workspace (in this case, sRGB will work best for you) to the profile
used for a photo printer and paper you want to order.
Follow these steps to prepare a file for a photo service, such as Costco, or
when printing to your own desktop printer that installs profiles for the
papers you use:
1. Make all the necessary edits you need to make in Elements and save
your files in TIFF format.
You must use TIFF format to use the converter we mention in Step 6.
2. Download color profiles from your provider’s Web site.
Almost all service centers post color profiles for their printing equip-
ment. You can visit the Costco Web site at www.costco.com, click the
Services link on the home page, and click Photo Center on the next page.
You’re prompted to set up an account, and then you see a page where
profiles are listed. Costco makes the profiles available for stores in their
geographic regions, and usually you find profiles for printing on the
store’s equipment and profiles best suited for different papers. Note:
If several profiles are available for downloading, be certain to use the
right profile for the paper you want your pictures to be printed on.
If you use a photo lab that wants you to convert color and embed 
profiles, you can visit independent lab Web sites and download profiles
as well.
If you want to convert color to your own printer, use a color profile
installed for your printer.
3. Copy the profiles to your system color folder: C:\WINDOWS\system32\
spool\drivers\color.
This folder is where all your color profiles are stored.
If you’re converting color for your own printer, this folder contains all
the color profiles installed by your printer when you installed the
printer driver.
4. Download a converter by going to http://drycreekphoto.com/tools/
profile_converter and clicking the ProfileConverterSetup.zip link.
You need a utility to convert your files that use the Adobe RGB (1998) or
sRGB color space to the color space used by machines at your service
center. Fortunately, the Dry Creek Photo converter is a great free tool.

The Dry Creek Photo Web site is one of the best sources of information
available for color management and color profiling. In addition to offer-
ing custom color-profiling services, Dry Creek Photo hosts a number of
different color profiles for many different commercial printers.
5. After downloading the file to your hard drive, double-click the Setup
file and follow the brief steps in the install wizard.
6. Choose Start➪Programs➪Dry Creek Photo➪Profile Converter➪ICC
Profile Converter.
The simple program interface opens, as you see in Figure 14-1.
Figure 14-1: Select the options for converting the color profile and select 
the Embed Profile in Image check box before clicking the Convert button.
7. Click the Source Image ellipsis (. . .) and select the source file.
The source file is the file saved in TIFF format that you want to print.
8. Click the Source Color Profile ellipsis and select the source color profile.
This color profile is currently embedded in your source file.
9. Click the Destination Image ellipsis and select the folder where you
want to save your file.
10. Click the Destination Color Profile ellipsis and select the color profile
used by the equipment where you place your order.
You saved your color profiles to the Windows color folder, so be certain
to look in this folder for the target printer color profiles.
11. If you want to process multiple files, select the Process Multiple Files
check box.
12. Be certain to select the Embed Profile in Image check box and then
click the Convert button.
After you click Convert, the profile converter handles the profile conver-
sion and saves your files to the target folder.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Converting profiles using operating system tools (Macintosh)
If you’re a Mac user, you don’t have to look far when you want to convert
color spaces in your photos to output profiles. Mac OS X has a number of
AppleScripts that few people know about. You can convert profiles for indi-
vidual images or batch-process the conversion just like Windows users who
work with the Dry Creek Photo utility.
On the Mac, follow these steps when you want to prepare files for a service
such as the Costco photo centers or when you’re printing to your desktop
printer:
1. Make all the necessary edits in Elements and save your files in the
format needed by your service center.
In many cases, JPEG files are used by service centers. If you intend to
print your pictures to your own desktop printer, use TIFF for the format.
Also, be certain to use sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998) as your working space
and save your files with the working space embedded in the images.
(See Chapter 2 to find out how to save your photos while embedding a
working space profile.)
2. Open the AppleScripts ColorSync folder.
AppleScripts are miniature programs installed with your operating system
and custom scripts you can create with the Apple Script Editor, also
installed with your operating system installation. On Mac OS X, a
number of short scripts are installed for you to convert color spaces in
files saved as JPEG or TIFF. To find the scripts used for converting color
profiles, open Macintosh HD/Library/ColorSync/Scripts.
3. Locate the script to convert the
color in your photo or photos.
Open the ColorSync folder and
identify the scripts used for con-
verting and embedding color
output profiles. Locate the
Embed chosen profile script in
the Scripts folder inside the
ColorSync folder as shown in
Figure 14-2.
The Embed Chosen Profile
script prompts you in a dialog
box to select the profile you
want to use for your color
output source.
Figure 14-2: Locate the Embed Chosen Profile
icon in the Scripts folder.

4. Drag a file or multiple files to the
Embed a Chosen Profile script
icon:
A dialog box opens where you’re
prompted to identify only your
output profile. Assuming that you
saved all your images by embed-
ding either the sRGB or Adobe
RGB (1998) color profile (in Step 1), drag the files to the Embed Chosen
Profile Script icon; the dialog box shown in Figure 14-3 opens. To select 
a specific output profile, click OK.
The Choose a File dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 14-4. The
AppleScript automatically opens the folder where your color profiles 
are stored.
Figure 14-4: Select the output color profile.
5. From the drop-down list, select the profile you want to use and click
the Choose button.
That’s it. Your file is converted to your chosen output profile.

Printing to Epson Inkjet Printers
Print settings vary according to manufacturers, and we can’t hope to cover
all printers in this chapter. We choose to discuss Epson printers as an intro-
duction to printing to desktop color printers in this chapter, but we also show
some print options for HP and Canon low-end inkjets later in the chapter.
If you own a different brand of printer or use a service that uses other printers,
what’s important to know in reviewing this section is the process involved in
printing your files. Regardless of what type of printer you own, be aware of
when a color profile is used and how color is either managed or not managed.
You may have different check box selections and menu commands, but the
process is identical for any printer printing your photos.
Over the past few years, at least half of many service provider troubleshoot-
ing tech calls coming from clients involved problems with accurate color
output from Epson and some other ink jet printers. We’re not talking about
subtle changes between monitor and printer, but, rather, huge monstrous
color changes on output prints. As it turns out, almost all the strange output
results originated from just one minor error when setting up a file to print —
when and how to manage color in the Print dialog box.
We’ve come up with settings that will work well for you to get accurate results
without stress or frustration. Just remember to use the settings exactly as
described, and you can achieve superior results with either desktop or profes-
sional printers.
When you install your printer driver, the installation utility also installs a
number of color profiles. You can choose the profiles in the Photoshop
Elements Print dialog box and control all the printing by using the profile pro-
vided by your printer manufacturer.
You can also print from the Organizer by selecting one or more image thumb-
nails in the Organizer window and then choosing File➪Print. We use printing
from Standard Edit mode for the examples shown here because you may
often want to perform some final corrections before printing.
You have a choice for how these profiles are used. You can
 Choose an automatic method where the manufacturer created a no-
nonsense process of automatic profile selection using your printer
driver.
 Choose to select the printer profile in the Print dialog box. The color
profile is automatically selected when you choose the paper source.
Both methods are described in the following sections.

Automatic profile selection for Epson printers
The automatic profile selection method exists, and we want to explain to you
what goes on with it so that you’re aware, but we don’t recommend that you
use it for your printing chores. Among other things, you really can’t tell by
looking in the Print Preview dialog box what profile you’re using to print your
file. In addition, you don’t have a way to convert your working space color to
the device profile for accurate color viewing on your monitor. But you should
understand what goes on when the selection is made so that you’re aware of
some potential consequences.
The color engines in Photoshop Elements — ICM (Image Color Management
in Windows), Colorsync (on the Mac), and the Epson print driver — work in a
similar manner, although they all show subtle differences when they’re used
to convert a file.
For your first setup instructions, we use the Epson Color Engine and work
with an unconverted file, letting the printer driver automatically select the
color profile. Our unconverted file is a photo still in its native color space,
such as sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). Assuming that your file is open in
Elements and you already sized your file for the target dimensions and reso-
lution for output, follow the steps in the next section to print from the native
color space (sRGB or Adobe RGB [1998]).
311
Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
Sizing files for output
When we talk about sizing files, we’re referring
to the physical width and height dimensions and
the resolution. If you print your pictures at 8
inches by 10 inches, be certain that you visit
the Image Size dialog box by choosing Image➪
Resize➪Image Size and verify that the width
and height dimensions are established for your
desired paper size. Also critically important is
the image resolution, which you can also adjust
in the Image Size dialog box. Use your printer
manufacturer recommendations for resolution
according to the paper type you use. If you can’t
find a recommendation in the user manual, 
use 300 ppi (pixels per inch) as a standard for
printing to quality coated-paper stocks, such as
Epson premium glossy photo paper.
Above all, don’t size your image resolution
larger than the default size of your photo. For
example, if you have a 5 x 7 inch photo at 300
ppi, don’t try to size the photo up to 8 x 10 inches
at 300 ppi. Doing so can produce unexpected
results. If you need an image size larger than
your file size, go back to your original digital
camera image and edit it for color correction
and size it to the desired output. If the original
camera image is smaller than you want, you’re
stuck and can’t get a quality print that greatly
exceeds your camera’s capture capabilities.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Printing from Windows
Follow these steps to print from the native color space in Windows:
1. Choose File➪Page Setup.
The Page Setup dialog box opens.
2. Select the orientation of your
print.
Your choices are either Portrait
or Landscape.
3. Click the Printer button to
open a second Page Setup
dialog box. From the Name
drop-down list, select your
printer, as shown in Fig-
ure 14-5, and then click OK.
4. Click OK again to dismiss the Page Setup dialog box.
5. Choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box.
6. Click the Show More Options check box to display the color manage-
ment options, as shown in Figure 14-6.
Figure 14-6: Select the Show More Options check box and select Printer 
Color Management from the Printer Profile drop-down list.
By default, the color management options are hidden.
7. From the Printer Profile drop-down list, select Printer Color
Management.
This choice uses your current workspace color and later converts the
color from your workspace to the printer output file when you open the
printer driver dialog box.
8. Click Print in the Print dialog box.
The file doesn’t print yet. Rather, the same second print dialog box that
appears in Step 3 opens again.
Figure 14-5: Click the orientation matching
your photo, and then click OK.

9. Verify that your target printer is still selected in the Print dialog box
(the second Print dialog box) and click Properties.
The printer driver dialog box opens.
Each printer displays a different
dialog box after you click
Properties in the second Print
dialog box. Figure 14-7 shows
you the Epson Stylus Photo R320
Series Properties dialog box.
Although many Epson printers
use an identical dialog box, you
find that some Epson printers,
especially the high-end devices, 
display different dialog boxes.
Furthermore, printers from other
manufacturers appear with com-
pletely different settings in the
printer driver dialog box.
10. Set print attributes.
In our Epson example, select
Premium Glossy Photo Paper
(or another paper from the Type
drop-down list that you may be
using), and then click the Best
Photo radio button, as shown 
in Figure 14-7.
Now, it’s time to color manage
your file. This step is critical 
in your print production 
workflow.
11. Click the Advanced button,
and then, in the warning
dialog box, simply click
Continue.
The Advanced Settings dialog
box opens, as shown in 
Figure 14-8.
12. A few choices need to be made
in this dialog box. The most
important are
• Select a paper type. You selected paper already? The second 
drop-down menu in the Paper & Quality section of the dialog
box determines the application of inks. Choose the same paper
here as you did in Step 10.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
• Turn color management on. Because you’re letting the print driver
determine the color, you need to be certain that the Color Controls
radio button is active. This setting tells the print driver to automat-
ically select a printer profile for the paper type you selected.
• Set the color mode. Do not use Epson Vivid. This choice produces
inferior results on photos. Choose the Epson Standard setting
(refer to Figure 14-8).
If you frequently print files using the same settings, you can save your
settings by clicking the Save Setting button.
13. To print the photo, click OK and then OK again in the Print dialog box.
Your file is sent to your printer. The color is converted automatically
from your source workspace of sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998) to the profile
the printer driver automatically selects for you.
Printing from the Macintosh
On the Macintosh, the Epson printer driver offers you some different settings,
although the process is quite similar. Again, we use the automatic method for
color conversion and let the print driver handle the conversion.
Follow these steps to print from the Mac:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 7 in the preceding section.
Make a choice for paper orientation and select Printer Color
Management in the Elements Print dialog box (just like Windows users).
2. After making choices for paper orientation and color profile in the
Elements Print dialog box, click Print.
A second Print dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 14-9.
3. From the pop-up menu below
Presets, select Print Settings.
Choices available to you from
the pop-up menu shown in
Figure 14-9 are specific to your
printer type. If you use a printer
other than Epson, and some-
times other than a specific
Epson model, your menu
choices change.
Figure 14-9: Select Print Settings in the printer
driver dialog box.

4. In the Print Settings dialog
box, select the paper type from
the Media Type pop-up menu.
Click the Advanced radio
button and select Best Photo
from the pop-up menu (see
Figure 14-10).
Note that you may have some
other options choices for
Quality if you’re using another
Epson printer. If so, choose the
best quality from the list you
see on the menu.
Now it’s time to select the color
management method.
5. From the pop-up menu where
you now see Print Settings,
click to open the menu and
select Color Management, as
shown in Figure 14-11.
6. Click Color Controls.
Making this choice tells the
print driver to manage the
color.
7. Select Epson Standard from
the Mode pop-up menu.
8. Click Print to print the file.
The file is sent to your printer
with an automatic color conver-
sion from your workspace color
to the printer color profile.
Selecting a printer profile
Another method for managing color when you’re printing files is to select 
a printer profile from the available list of color profiles installed with your
printer. Whereas in the earlier section “Automatic profile selection for Epson
printers” you used your printer to manage color, this time you let Photoshop
Elements manage the color. Again, the Windows options and Macintosh com-
mands vary a little, so we discuss how to print by selecting a profile for each
operating system.

Printing using a printer profile in Windows
The steps in this section are the same as the ones described for printing files
for automatic profile selection when you’re setting up the page and selecting
a printer. When you choose File➪Print, you open the Elements Print dialog
box as described in the previous section. Your steps now change when you
let Elements handle the color conversion, and you proceed to move through
the Print dialog box as follows:
1. From the Printer Profile drop-down list in the Print dialog box, select
the color profile designed for use with the paper you have chosen to
print your image.
In this example, we use a heavyweight matte paper color profile, as
shown in Figure 14-12. (Note that custom color profiles you acquire from
a profiling service come with recommended color-rendering intents. For
this paper, Relative Colormetric is recommended and is selected on the
Rendering Intent drop-down menu, as you see in Figure 14-12.)
Figure 14-12: Choose a printer profile that matches the paper you use.
2. Click Print.
The second Print dialog box opens.
3. Click the Properties button.
You arrive at the same dialog box shown earlier in this chapter, in 
Figure 14-7.
4. Click the Best Photo radio button. From the Type drop-down list,
select the recommended paper choice.
Custom color profiles are also shipped with guidelines for selecting
proper paper.
5. Click Advanced and click Continue to arrive at the same dialog box
shown earlier, in Figure 14-8.
The paper choice selection is automatically carried over from the previ-
ous Properties dialog box (in Step 2 in the steps in the preceding section).
The one different setting you make is in the Color Management section.

6. Click the ICM (Image Color Management) radio button and click No
Color Management, as shown in Figure 14-13.
Figure 14-13: Click ICM and click No Color Management.
Because you selected the color profile in Step 1 and you’re letting
Elements manage the color, be sure that Color Management is turned 
off. If you don’t turn color management off, you end up double profiling
your print.
Printing using a printer profile on the Mac
On the Mac, you follow the same steps in Elements to select a printer profile
in the Elements Print dialog box. When you select Color Management as we
described in Figure 14-11, select the Off (No Color Adjustment) radio button.
You make all other settings choices by following the same steps described in
the section “Printing from the Macintosh,” earlier in this chapter.
Printing with a custom profile
Printing with a custom profile is very simple. Just remember that you must
use the profile with exactly the same settings as you used to print the test
target when the profile was created. For custom profiles, you always use no
color management throughout the output process.
Let us make this concept even clearer. When you generate your test target for
the profiling service where you may order a custom profile created for your
printer, the service requires that you print the target without color conversions
of any kind. The target has to reflect the actual colors generated by your
printer from a known sample file with no modifications whatsoever for a known
printing condition and media type. The resulting profile tells the color engine
exactly how to modify the output data to match the colors as closely as possi-
ble to your working space or a different previously embedded color profile.
For all this to work properly, the printer can’t be allowed to modify the print-
ing data in any way. All the work has to be done by Photoshop Elements. So,
assuming that you have a custom profile ready to use, here’s the setup:
317
Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper

318
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
1. Use a profile converter to convert color.
In Windows, use a utility like the Dry Creek Photo Profile Converter,
and on the Mac use an AppleScript to convert color. (For details, see
“Converting color to a printer profile,” earlier in this chapter.)
If you have obtained a custom profile from a media supplier, you must
use the specific media and intent settings it recommend for your printer,
although all other instructions in this section are the same.
2. Open the converted file in Elements and choose File➪Print.
3. In the Print dialog box, select Same As Source for your printer profile,
as shown in Figure 14-14.
Figure 14-14: Select Same As Source when you print files with converted color.
4. Turn off color management.
Use the same settings for printing when you let Elements determine color.
Be certain to turn off color management, the same way we show you in
Figure 14-13, in the section “Printing using a printer profile in Windows.”
Printing to HP Inkjet Printers
Regardless of the printer you use, the process for printing follows the same
logic as we describe for printing to Epson printers. Unfortunately, each manu-
facturer uses different dialog boxes and different menu command names that
can leave you completely confused if you try to apply the steps you use in
printing on one printer to a second, different printer.
The three methods for managing color (described in the section “Understanding
how Elements uses color profiles,” earlier in this chapter) apply to all printers,
but the dialog boxes, buttons, and menu choices appear differently.
If you own an HP printer, you probably know where to make your paper 
selection and your best photo selection. The most obscure setting is likely 
to be the color management choice. Rather than step through each detailed
step for printing to an HP low-end desktop printer, take a look in the following
section at how to manage color.

Printing to HP printers in Windows
As with all printers, you have three choices for managing color with an HP
printer:
 Let your printer determine color. Follow these general steps:
1. Choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box.
2. Click the Show More Options check box to display color manage-
ment options (refer to Figure 14-6).
3. From the Printer Profile
drop-down menu, select
Printer Color Manage-
ment and then click Print.
A second Print dialog box
opens.
4. Click Properties to 
open the printer driver
dialog box.
5. On the Advanced tab,
click Graphic and click
Image Color Management.
From the ICM Method
drop-down menu, select
ICM Handled by Printer,
as shown in Figure 14-15.
 Let Elements determine color. Follow the preceding steps, but this time
select a color profile in the Print dialog box (refer to Step 3) and select
ICM Disabled on the Advanced tab (refer to Step 5).
 Print a file with converted color. Follow the preceding steps, but select
Same As Source in the Print dialog box (refer to Step 3) and select ICM
Disabled on the Advanced tab (refer to Step 5).
Printing to HP printers on the Macintosh
If there’s a way to manage color by using one of the HP Deskjet 5400 series of
printers, we haven’t found it. HP and Windows go together like bread and
butter, but HP printers and Macintosh computers leave a lot to be desired.
Among the problems with using an HP printer on the Macintosh is the inabil-
ity to turn off color management. Therefore, the only surefire method of
printing to an HP printer on the Mac is to let the printer manage the color.
Don’t attempt to use a specific color profile, and don’t try to convert color
before printing.

just HP papers and make a
selection for the HP paper 
type you use, as shown in
Figure 14-16.
Because the HP printer driver deter-
mines the options in the Mac OS
Print dialog box, you don’t have an
option for Color Management, like
you do when you’re using a printer
like an Epson. When you use the HP
printer driver, no color management
options appear on the pop-up menu
in the Print dialog box, as shown in
Figure 14-16.
Printing to Canon Printers
As with Epson and HP printers (described earlier in the chapter), you follow
the same logic and choose to either enable or disable color management
when printing to Canon printers. With Canon color printers, the area in the
printer driver dialog box is even more hidden than you find in Epson and HP
desktop printers.
Printing to Canon printers in Windows
When printing to Canon printers in Windows, you control color management
as follows:
 Let your printer determine color. Follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box.
2. Click the Show More Options check box to display color manage-
ment options (refer to Figure 14-6).
Figure 14-16: Select an HP paper in the Paper
Type/Quality dialog box.

3. From the Printer Profile drop-down menu, select Printer Color
Management and then click Print.
A second Print dialog box opens.
4. Click Properties to open the printer driver dialog box.
5. On the Main tab, click Manual in the Color/Intensity area, as
shown in Figure 14-17.
Figure 14-17: Click the Manual radio button for Color/Intensity.
6. Click the Set button to
open the Manual Color
Adjustment dialog box.
7. Select the Enable 
ICM (Windows Color
Management) check box,
shown in Figure 14-18.
 To let Elements determine
color: Follow the preceding set
of steps and deselect the Enable
ICM (Windows Color Manage-
ment) check box in Step 7.

 To print a file with converted color: Select Same As Source in the Print
dialog box in Step 3, and deselect ICM (Windows Color Management) in
Step 7.
Printing to Canon 
printers on the Mac
You make the same choices on the
Mac as you do in Windows for how
you want to manage color on a
Canon printer. If you let the printer
manage the color, you make a paper
choice in the Quality & Media sec-
tion of the Print dialog box, shown in
Figure 14-19. This dialog box appears
after you click Print in Elements and
after you select Quality & Media
from the pop-up menu, below the
Presets menu.
From the pop-up menu below the
Presets menu, select Color Options.
You select BJ Standard when you’re
letting Elements determine color and
select None when you select a
printer profile in the Elements Print
dialog box; or, select Same As Source
when you’re printing a file with con-
verted color. The options are shown
in Figure 14-20.
Submitting Files to 
Service Centers
On provider Web sites, you can usu-
ally find guidelines for acceptable
file formats and the recommended resolutions and dimensions of your
images. If you don’t see these guidelines on Web sites, be sure to call and
inquire about which file attributes are acceptable.
As a general rule, here are some things you should consider when you’re sub-
mitting files if guidelines aren’t provided:
Figure 14-19: Make a paper choice in the
Quality & Media dialog box.
Figure 14-20: Select BJ Standard for printing
when you want Elements to determine color, or
turn off color management by selecting None.

 Color workspace: Always ask providers what workspace it prefers to
use to convert color. Online services generally recommend that you use
sRGB as your color workspace.
 Resolution: For photo printing machines, be certain to submit files at
300 ppi (pixels per inch). See Chapter 3 for more information on image
resolution.
 Dimensions: As a general rule, size images to the print size. For example,
if you want 4-x-6-inch prints, be certain that your images are sized to 
4 x 6 inches at 300 ppi.
 File format: Some centers may take only JPEG images. If TIFF isn’t
acceptable, open the converted images you saved from the Dry Creek
ICC Profile Converter (in Windows):
1. Open the TIFF file or files in Photoshop Elements and choose
File➪Save As.
2. Be certain that the ICC Profile check box is selected in the Save
Options in the Save/Save As dialog box. Select JPEG for the
format and click Save.
Notice that the profile used with the Dry Creek ICC Profile Converter
is listed as the ICC Profile. In Figure 14-21, you can see a profile
embedded for a Costco print center. (See the section “Converting
color to a printer profile,” earlier in this chapter, for more on the Dry
Creek Converter.)
Figure 14-21: You can change file formats from TIFF to JPEG and preserve 
embedded profiles when you’re saving from Elements.
If you’re a Mac user, you can convert color by using a JPEG format, and
you don’t need to be concerned with saving files in a different format in
Elements.
 Media storage: If you walk into a FedEx Kinko’s store and go to the self-
serve photo-printing machines, you don’t see support for any external
USB hard drives or removable USB drives. All the print centers support 
323
Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper

324
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
a wide range of media cards used by digital cameras. Be certain to use
your memory cards and not USB devices when placing orders. If you use
Compact Flash II, memory sticks, or other media sources used by digital
cameras, copy your files to these sources when you place orders as a
walk-in customer.
Vendors that host Web sites with downloadable profiles and order informa-
tion are likely to accept file uploads online. This capability saves you the time
spent fighting crowds when you’re placing orders. In some cases, you can
have service centers mail your images back to you so that you don’t need to
wait when you’re picking up orders, either. This online ordering stuff is
another matter that we talk about in the next section, however.
Using Online Printing Services
Photoshop Elements supports the Adobe Photoshop Services program, which
is a joint effort between Adobe Systems and Kodak EasyShare (formerly Ofoto),
a division of Kodak. The Services program offers online ordering of prints 
and sharing of photos and projects, and it has a huge array of different print
products for consumers and professionals.
As of this writing, you get ten free prints, so it’s worth taking a little time to
check out the service — especially if you want to order prints and have them
mailed directly to your home or office. No lines, no hassles, no fighting high-
rising gasoline costs — this service offers great prints and an abundance of
convenience.
To use the service, follow these steps:
1. Select files in the Organizer much like you would select files for 
printing.
2. In either editing mode or the Organizer, choose File➪Order Prints.
The Kodak EasyShare Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 14-22. The first
screen shown in the wizard is a form for you to create an account.
If you try to place an order from your office where the IT department
prevents you from connecting to some external sources, you may need
to have your firewall settings adjusted. Talk to someone in your IT
department to help you make a connection.
3. If you haven’t set up an account already, fill in the information and
step through the wizard by clicking the Next button on each page.
If you have set up an account, supply your logon information.
The selected files in the Organizer are automatically loaded in Step 1 of
the wizard order page.

Figure 14-22: Choose File➪Order Prints and the Kodak EasyShare Wizard opens.
4. You can modify your order by deleting files from the order and speci-
fying different print sizes and quantities.
One nice feature in the service is the option for sending duplicate prints
to another party. You can keep an address book on the provider’s Web
site and specify whom you want to receive an order. This feature is help-
ful if you’re away spending your children’s inheritance on a Caribbean
cruise and want to send all your kids photos of the great time you’re
having. Just pop open your laptop on the pool deck, load the digital
camera images, and connect via a wireless connection. Before you return
to Buffalo in midwinter with a suntan, your kids will frown as they fan
through the prints they received a week earlier.
5. Continue stepping through the wizard to upload your files and confirm
your order. Click the Finish button on the last pane and your order is
complete.

Exploring Other Print Options
Photoshop Elements provides you with other options for printing things like
video images and contact sheets, adding borders and trim lines, and invert-
ing images for heat transfers like the ones you may use for iron-on T-shirt
designs. You find these options in the Print dialog box. Most of these print
options are intuitive and easy to use. Just poke around, experiment, and have
fun. When it comes time to print, just follow the recommendations we offer
here for getting your color right.

E
lements is a great packaging tool that you can use to deploy your photos
and creations for screen viewing. And that’s not just your computer
monitor. You can edit photos or assemble creations that are exported for
Web viewing, too, and you can even prepare files to show on your television.
In Chapter 3, you find out about resolutions and color modes. The
output requirements for printing files, which we cover in
Chapter 14, are much different from what you use for
images output for screen viewing.
In this chapter, we cover the options for Web and
screen viewing that get you started with basics,
including saving images for the Web (or for screen
viewing), setting up a slideshow, and burning your
images on CDs or DVDs.
Getting Familiar with the Elements
Sharing and Printing Options
Before we delve into telling you how to make creations for
screen viewing, you should be familiar with your available options for
not only screen images, but also sharing and printing. When you open the
Organizer and look at the Shortcuts bar, you see three icons. For lack of a

328
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
better term to globally describe these options, we refer to them as packaging
your files.
In Figure 15-1, you can see the menu options for the respective items:
 Printing: The first menu offers you options for ordering online prints.
 Sharing: The second menu provides a number of different sharing
options, such as e-mail, e-mail to a mobile phone, Adobe Photoshop
online services, and other types of services.
 Making photo creations: The third menu (Create) contains commands
for a variety of different printing options locally on your desktop printer,
options for creating screen presentations, and a few services you can
order online.
Figure 15-1: Three menus provide a number of different sharing and printing options.
In Chapter 14, we talk about ordering online prints using commands on the
first drop-down menu and sharing options on the second drop-down menu.
In this chapter and later in Chapter 16, we cover various commands on the
Create drop-down menu.
Creating a Slide Show
This Million Dollar Baby is no Mystic River — it’s simply Absolute Power! Well,
maybe you won’t travel the same path from Rowdy Yates to multiple Academy
Award–winning director and filmmaker Clint Eastwood, but even Mr. Eastwood
might be impressed with the options for moviemaking with the Photoshop

Elements slide show creations. When he’s not rolling out his Panaflex camera,
he may just want to take photos of the grandkids and do the directing and pro-
ducing as well as the editing right in Photoshop Elements.
For the rest of us, we can be our own Clint Eastwood wannabes by using the
powerful features of the Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor to create PDF
slide shows and movie files. It’s so easy that Elements promises you won’t be
Unforgiven.
Creating a project
You create a project file in the Slide Show Editor and can then export it for a
number of different uses. In this section, you find out how to create and save
your project. In the next section, you dive into exporting.
Here’s how to create a slide show project that you can edit and export later:
1. Open the Organizer and select the pictures you want to use in your
slide show.
2. Click the Create button on the Shortcuts bar and choose Slide Show
from the drop-down menu.
The Slide Show Preferences dialog box opens. Just about everything in the
dialog box can be adjusted in the Slide Show Editor, so don’t worry about
making choices here. If you want to keep the Slide Show Preferences
dialog box from reappearing when you make slide creations, deselect 
the Show This Dialog Each Time a New Slide Show Is Created check box.
3. Click OK in the Slide Show Preferences dialog box.
The Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor opens, as shown in
Figure 15-2.
4. If your Slide Show Editor doesn’t show you a screen similar to the one
shown in Figure 15-2, maximize the window by clicking the Maximize
button in the upper-right corner of the Editor window.
This way, you can see the Storyboard at the bottom of the screen and
the Palette Bin on the right side of the editor.
5. (Optional) Create a Pan and Zoom view.
As slides are shown, you can zoom and pan a slide. Click the Enable Pan
and Zoom check box and click the Start thumbnail. A rectangle appears
in the preview area. Move any one of the four corner handles in or out 
to resize the rectangle. Moving the cursor inside the rectangle and click-
ing the mouse button enables you to move the rectangle around the 
preview.

Figure 15-2: The Elements Slide Show Editor is where you create slideshows.
For the end zoom position, click the End thumbnail and size the rectan-
gle to a zoomed view or a view that you want to stop the zoom. Notice in
Figure 15-3 that the End thumbnail is selected and the rectangle is sized
down to the zoom area on a portion of the photo.
6. (Optional) Add a graphic.
A library of graphics appears in the Extras pane in the Palette Bin. Drag
a graphic to a slide. If you want a blank slide to appear first and then add
text and graphics to the blank slide, click Add Blank Slide on the
Shortcuts bar at the top of the editor.
7. (Optional) Add text.

Figure 15-3: Open the Slide Show Editor and choose your options for a slide show.
Click the Text tool in the Extras pane in the Palette Bin and drag a text
style to the blank slide or the opening slide in the slide show. After you
drag text to a slide, the Properties pane opens in the Palette Bin. The text
you drag to the slide is placeholder text. To edit the text, click Edit Text in
the Properties pane. You can also select a font, a font point size, a color
for the text, text alignment, and a font style. After setting the type attrib-
utes, click inside the text and move it to the position you want.
8. (Optional) Set transitions.
The icons between the slides in the Storyboard (at the bottom of the
Slide Show Editor) indicate a default transition applied to the slide show.
You can change transition effects for each slide independently or to all
the slides in the show. Click the right-pointing arrow on the right side of
a transition icon to open a pop-up menu containing a number of different
transitions. If you want to apply the same transition to all slides, choose
Apply to All from the menu commands.
9. (Optional) Add audio and media.
You can add audio to the slide show by choosing Add Media➪Audio from
Organizer (or from Folder). Select an audio file and click OK.
You can also add movie files to your slide show. A movie file can be added
on top of a slide or on a new slide. When the slide show is played, the
video file plays. Choose Add Media➪Photos and Videos from Organizer
(or from Folder).
331

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
This same set of commands can also be used to add more pictures to
the slide show.
10. (Optional) Record your own sounds.
If you want to add narration, click the Narration tool in the Palette Bin,
and the Extras pane changes to provide you with tools to record a 
sound or import a sound file. Note that this option requires you to have
a microphone properly configured on your computer.
11. (Optional) Fit slides to the audio.
If you have 3 minutes of audio and the slide duration is 2 minutes 30 sec-
onds, you can, with a single mouse click, fit the slide duration uniformly
to fit the 3-minute audio time. Just click the Fit Slides to Audio tool
below the preview image.
If you want to manually adjust time for slide durations, click the down
arrow on the time readout below the slide thumbnails in the Storyboard.
12. Click Save Project on the Shortcuts bar and then, in the dialog box
that opens, type a name and click Save.
Your project is added to the Organizer and is available for further editing
later. Or, you can open the project to save in a number of different
output formats, as we explain in the next section.
13. Preview the slide show.
Before exporting the slide show, you can see a preview by clicking the
buttons directly below the image preview area. If you want a full-screen
preview, click the Preview button on the Shortcuts bar and click the Play
button.
Exporting to slides and video
After creating a project, you have a number of different output options. You
can write a project to disc for archival purposes and include slide shows on 
a VideoCD (videodisc) or DVD. You can e-mail a slide show to another user,
share a project online, write a project compatible for display on a TV, or save
to either a PDF slide show or Windows movie file.
To write a PDF slide show or a movie file, follow these steps:
1. In the Organizer window, double-click the project thumbnail.
The project opens in the Adobe Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor.
2. Click the Output tool on the Shortcuts bar.
The Output Your Slide Show Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 15-4.

Figure 15-4: Select Output in the Photoshop Elements Slide Show 
Editor, and the Slide Show Output Wizard opens.
3. Select the type of file you want to export to.
Select Movie File (.wmv) to export a Windows media video file. Your
exported video can be viewed in Elements or in the Windows Media
Player. You can import the video in all programs that support .wmv files.
Select PDF File (.pdf) if you want to create a PDF slide show. If you
create a PDF slide show, some of the animation features, such as zoom-
ing slides and transition effects, aren’t shown in the resultant PDF 
document.
4. In the dialog box that opens, which prompts you to add your output
file to the Organizer, click Yes.
You can now easily view the file by double-clicking it in the Organizer
window.
Opening multipage PDF files in Elements
If you create a slide show and export the slide show to a PDF document, you
can open individual PDF pages in Elements. Elements can open any PDF docu-
ment created from any PDF producer. Here’s how:
1. In the Organizer, select a file to open and click the Standard Edit
option on the Shortcuts bar.
Be sure to select the file and click Standard Edit. Don’t double-click the
file in the Organizer; that action opens the file in Adobe Reader.
333
Chapter 15: Showing It On-Screen

334
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
When the file is opened in Standard Edit mode, the Import PDF dialog
box opens, as shown in Figure 15-5.
Figure 15-5: Select a PDF file to open in Elements and the Import PDF 
dialog box opens.
2. In the dialog box, you can select one or more pages and specify the
resolution and color mode.
If you want to select several pages in a noncontiguous order press Ctrl
and click the pages you want to open.
3. Click OK to open the PDF pages in individual Image windows.
Writing Creations to CDs and DVDs
You can output creations, such as slide shows and images you optimize for
TV, to a CD or DVD by using the Slide Show Output Wizard. If you have a
movie but don’t have a DVD burner, most DVD players sold today enable you
to view videodiscs written to CDs. The CDs just don’t hold as much content
as DVD do.
To write to a CD or DVD, follow these steps:

1. Open a project in the Slide Show Output Wizard by choosing
File➪Open Creation in the Organizer window.
2. Click Output in the Slide Show Editor.
3. Click Burn to Disc in the Slide Show Output Wizard.
4. Select an option for the type of output you want to use — VCD or DVD
(see Figure 15-6).
• To create a CD: Select VCD (Lower Quality; Works on TV or Com-
puter). When you select this option, your project is converted to 
a movie file (.wmv in Windows) or QuickTime movie file (Mac)
during the write process. If you want more files added to the CD,
select the Include Additional Slide Shows I’ve Made on This Disc
check box.
• To burn a DVD: Check the option DVD (Higher Quality; Works on
TV or Computer) in the Slide Show Output window. Using this
option requires you to have Adobe Premiere Elements installed 
on your computer (Windows).

6. Click the video format (either
NTSC or PAL) and click OK.
The status bar shows the writ-
ing progress.
After the CD or DVD finishes writing,
pop open your CD/DVD drive and
remove the disc. Place the disc in
your DVD player and press Play. The
movie automatically starts playing,
like any commercial videodisc.
Creating a Flash Gallery
Another option for screen-viewing
your photos is to display them on
the Web. With Photoshop Elements,
you don’t need to know a hoot about
Web page design and HTML coding.
Elements creates all you need to upload attractive collections to your per-
sonal Web site. This is all accomplished by using the Flash Gallery menu 
command, which you select from the Create drop-down menu.
To see how easy it is to create a Web page showing off your photos, follow
these steps:
1. Open the Organizer and select the photos you want to display on your
Web site.
2. Click Create on the Shortcuts bar and choose Flash Gallery from the
menu options.
The Flash Gallery Wizard opens.
When you open the Wizard window, you see a scrollable list of the
photos you selected in the Organizer window.
3. Click a template in the Choose a Template section of the Flash Gallery
Wizard and click a style to select it.
You can scroll horizontally for templates and styles. Just click the
thumbnails you want to use, as shown in Figure 15-8.
Figure 15-7: Click Burn to Disc in the Slide
Show Output Wizard to open the Burn 
dialog box.

Figure 15-8: Click a template and style.
4. Click the Next Step button.
You arrive at the second pane in the Flash Gallery Wizard.
5. Set the attributes for the Flash Gallery.
You can add titles, choose slide durations, pick transition effects, set
background colors, and preview your creation. Play around with the
options in the Wizard window and add the effects you want for your
Flash presentation.
6. Click the Browse button and locate a folder where you want to save
your files. Type a name for your creation in the Save Gallery As text
box, as shown in Figure 15-9.
7. Click Share to save the creation.
Elements automatically creates an HTML file and copies your pictures as
JPEGs to a separate folder. In addition, a number of subfolders with differ-
ent assets are created. You don’t have to worry about the files Elements
creates for you because they’re all neatly tucked in a folder according to
the name you identify in the Flash Gallery Wizard window. Just remember
the location and folder name you provide for your creation.

flipbooks. If you want to create a quick little video that shows off your photos
by flashing stills on your screen or your TV set, you can quickly create a flip-
book. Here’s how you do it:
1. Open the Organizer and select the files you want to use.
Note that you must select at least two files in order to create the 
flipbook.
2. Click Create on the Shortcuts bar and choose Video Flipbook.
The Photoshop Elements Video Flipbook opens, as shown in

A
dobe Photoshop Elements offers you a number of creations that can be
shared on-screen or in print. From the Create drop-down menu on the
Shortcuts bar, you have a number of menu choices for making creations.
In Chapter 15, we look at creating files for screen and Web viewing.
In this chapter, we talk about creations designed for print and
sharing. It’s all here in Elements, but shhhhh. Don’t tell the
Photoshop people because Photoshop doesn’t have all
these wonderful creation features.
Getting a Grip on Assembling
Creations
In Chapter 15, we talk about slide shows, videodiscs,
and Flash Galleries. These creations offer different
output options, such as e-mailing, burning files to disc,
and creating HTML documents — as well as printing and
PDF creation.
The remaining creations you work with by using options you choose from the
Create drop-down menu, including Photo Book Pages, Photo Layouts, Album
Pages, Photo Calendars, and Photo Stamps. All these creations are designed
for output to your printer or for sending off files to an online printing service.

342
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
At the top of the Create drop-down menu, seven different commands are
listed, ranging from Photo Book Pages to CD/DVD Label. All these creations
use a very similar wizard to prepare your files and, ultimately, make the cre-
ation. Choosing any one of the first seven menu commands opens a wizard
like the one shown in Figure 16-1 when you click Photo Book Pages.
The items you choose in the wizard when you’re making creations for print
include
 Select a Size: From the drop-down list, you can select the sizes sup-
ported by the creation type. In some cases, only one size is available.
 Select a Layout: Choose a template you want to use from the thumbnails
in the scrollable window.
Figure 16-1: A similar wizard window appears for the first seven creation options.

 Select a Theme: Also from thumbnails in a scrollable window, you can
add borders and drop shadows by clicking a theme thumbnail.
 Auto-fill with Selected Images from the Organizer: Select this check
box if you select photos in the Organizer and want to include the
selected photos in your creation.
 Include Photo Captions: Select the check box if you want the photo 
captions to appear on each page under their respective photos.
 Number of Pages: Elements automatically creates the number of pages
to accommodate the number of photos you selected in the Organizer.
If you reduce the number, Elements creates additional files to accommo-
date all selected photos.
After assembling your creation, click the OK button. Elements then adds
the selected photos to the layout and theme you specified in the wizard.
Be patient and wait for Elements to complete the task.
After a creation has been made, the document appears like any other image
you open in Elements. You can crop, modify images, print, and more. Using
an Elements file, you choose File➪Save to open the Save As dialog box. Type
a name and click Save.
Creating the Family Photo Album
Elements provides some fancy ways to create pages for a photo album.
Album pages support all output formats except sharing services. Elements
offers options for printing pages that look just like pages in a fancy photo
album that you may purchase at your local drugstore.
Follow these steps to create Album Pages:
1. Select files in the Organizer and click Create. 
The procedure for all creations is the same. You first select files in the
Organizer (or an editing mode) and then click the Create button on the
Shortcuts bar. If you forget files that you want to add to a creation, the
creation wizards provide options for adding photos.
2. From the Create drop-down menu, select Photo Book Pages.
The New Photo Book Pages Wizard opens.
3. Select a size, layout, and theme.

The only size available for Photo Book Pages is 10.25 x 9 inches, which
appears as the default page size.
Click a layout from the Select a Layout scrollable window.
Click a theme from the Select a Theme scrollable window. (Note that this

Calendars
Create your own, personal calendar in Photoshop Elements, and you won’t
buy any more calendars as each new year rolls around. This tool is helpful for
creating calendars for the kids — using pictures of their soccer team, the
group at the boys and girls clubs, the 4-H club, that great vacation you took
with the family last year — or even for satisfying your own ego by passing out
your creations at the office. The calendar options have many uses, limited
only by your imagination.
Creating calendars in Elements 5 is handled through the Adobe Photoshop
Services, provided by Kodak EasyShare. You assemble your photos and create
your layout by using the EasyShare services, and then order the calendar from
the service.
Here’s how you go about using the EasyShare services for creating calendars:
1. Select 13 images in the Organizer and choose Create➪Photo Calendar.
The Kodak EasyShare Order Calendar wizard opens.
2. Log on to Kodak EasyShare.
If you don’t have an account, you need to create one. Fill in the identify-
ing information and click Next. If you already have an account with
Kodak EasyShare, click Sign In and type your logon name and password.
Your selected photos are uploaded to the Kodak EasyShare Web site
after you log in. Your default Web browser is launched, and it opens the
Kodak EasyShare Web page, where calendar services are offered.
3. Follow the instructions on the Kodak EasyShare Web site for placing
your order.
Kodak provides you with a number of different options for the calendar
layout and design. You can additionally choose from a number of attrib-
utes, such as month and year to start your calendar and fonts and 
binding choices. All these options are available in an intuitive format
on the Web site.
4. After making your design decisions, click Buy Prints to place your
order.
You fill out an online form where you supply your shipping address and
mailing information. When you confirm the order, your pictures are
printed on a professional-looking calendar and mailed to you.

Creating Personal Postage Stamps
Another new creation feature in Elements 5 is the option to create your own,
personal postage stamps. Yes, they’re real stamps that you can use for mail-
ing though the post office.
Here’s the simple, easy way to use Elements to place an order for your very
own personal postage stamps:
1. Select an image in the Organizer.
Your file needs to be less than 5MB. (See Chapter 3 for more on resizing
images.)
2. Click Create on the Shortcuts bar and choose PhotoStamps from
the menu.
The PhotoStamps dialog box opens.
3. Click the Upload My Photos button in the dialog box (see Figure 16-4).
Your photo is uploaded to the PhotoStamps.com Web site.
Figure 16-4: Choose Postage Stamps from the Create drop-down 
menu to open this dialog box.
4. Place your order.
The PhotoStamps.com Web site provides an easy-to-use interface for
ordering stamps. After you fill out the order and billing information, your
stamps are mailed to you.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Creating CD and DVD Labels
Another new feature added to the creation options in Elements 5 is the
simple, easy way to create CD and DVD labels. From the Create menu, you
choose a menu item and choose CD/DVD Label. From templates provided in a
wizard, Elements offers you an easy method for printing your own, personal
labels for CDs and DVDs.
Spreading the Love Through Sharing
Two methods of sharing your creations are available in Elements. You can
place orders with online services, from a variety of online service providers,
or you can e-mail your creations to others.
Ordering prints online
Right from within your Photoshop Elements workspace, you can place orders
for prints, photo books, and greeting cards and then have your creations
mailed to you and any number of friends and colleagues.
You have, under the Sharing button on the Shortcuts bar, three menu options
for online orders and sharing:
 Order Prints: Click this option to upload photos for which you want
photo prints mailed back to you and others. You use the Kodak
EasyShare Service to log on and place your orders.
 Order Kodak Photo Book: Choose this menu command when you want
your pictures displayed in a professional-looking photo book. You can
place an order for yourself and have duplicate photo books mailed to
other recipients.
 Order Photo Greeting Card: You create greeting cards, as we explain
earlier in this chapter, and upload your design to the Kodak EasyShare
Service for ordering sets of cards.
All these online services work similarly to each other. You select photos in
the Organizer and then open the Sharing button on the Shortcuts bar and
choose the menu option you want from the commands listed for online 
creations and sharing.
The Kodak EasyShare Wizard opens, where you add the order information
and logon information and then submit your order. The steps are straight-
forward and intuitive.

E-mailing creations
After you put together a creation with the Creation Wizard, you can e-mail the
creation to your friends, family, or whoever you like by choosing a simple
menu command. (We introduce this method and other ways to share cre-
ations in the section “Getting a Grip on Assembling Creations,” earlier in this
chapter.) Additionally, you can e-mail photos to mobile phones. The options
are all located under the Sharing button on the Shortcuts bar.
Rather than save your file from Elements and then open your e-mail client
and select the photo to attach to an e-mail message, Elements makes the
sharing of photos via e-mail as easy as a one-click step.
When you want to e-mail a creation, follow these steps:
1. In the Organizer, select the photos you want to e-mail to a friend.
2. Click the Sharing button on the Shortcuts bar and select E-Mail.
The Attach to E-Mail dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 16-5.

3. Select recipients and file attributes:
• Select Recipients: You can add recipients by clicking the Edit
Contacts button and add names and e-mail addresses. Select the
check box adjacent to the name of each recipient with whom you
want to share your photos.
• Choose Format: From the Format drop-down menu, you can
choose to send individual files or other creations you have stored
in the Organizer workspace.
• Select Size and Quality: For auto-sizing your photos, you can make
adjustments from the Maximum Photo Size drop-down menu and
select the compression amount for JPEG images.
• Message: In an optional item, you can type the text that you want
to appear in your e-mail message by adding text to the Message
window.
4. Click Next.
Your images are prepared according to the attributes specified in the
Attach to E-Mail dialog box. The files you selected are attached to a new
e-mail message.
5. Click the Send button in your e-mail client.
The photos are e-mailed to the recipients you identified.
By default, Elements uses your primary e-mail client application, which may
or may not be the e-mail program you use. You can change the default e-mail
client by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K to open the Preferences dialog box when you’re
in the Organizer and then clicking Sharing in the left pane. From a drop-down
list in the Sharing preferences, select the e-mail client application that you
want Elements to use.

Ten Tips for Composing 
Better Photos
In This Chapter
 Finding a focal point and using the rule of thirds
 Cutting the clutter and framing your shot
 Employing contrast, leading lines, and viewpoints
 Using light
 Giving direction
 Considering direction of movement
A
few things have to come together to make a great photograph. One
is being in the right place at the right time. Another is the
ability to tell a story. Yet another is excellent composition.
Unfortunately, we can’t help with your schedule or story-
telling, but we can give you several easy tips on how 
to take photographs that are interesting and well-
composed. Some of these tips overlap and contain
common concepts. But they’re all free; they don’t
require any extra money or equipment. All they take
are an open mind and an eye that’s willing to be
trained over time.
Find a Focal Point
One of the most important tools for properly composing a
photo is establishing a focal point — a main point of interest. If
too many elements are competing for attention, a photo probably
doesn’t have a clearly defined focal point. Your eye, therefore, doesn’t know
where to look. Too many images without a focal point cause the viewer to tire
quickly or lose interest. The eye wants to be drawn to a subject.

354
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Excessive background elements, like furniture, walls, tables, fences, build-
ings, and even random bystanders, don’t add much to the compositional or
emotional value of your shot. What you really want to capture are the smiles
and expressions of your family and friends.
Keep these tips in mind to help find your focal point:
 Pick your subject and then get close to it.
 Include a point of interest in scenic shots. Sunrises and sunsets are
pretty, but after you’ve seen a few, you’ve seen them all. Try to capture
an early morning fisherman casting his line off the pier or a child check-
ing out a rogue hermit crab at dusk. That once-ho-hum scenic shot now
has some visual punch.
 When it’s appropriate, try to include an element in the foreground,
middle ground, or background to add depth and a sense of scale, as
shown in Figure 17-1. Just make sure that it’s a meaningful element and
not random clutter.
Brand X Pictures
Figure 17-1: Including elements in the foreground adds depth to a photo.

Use the Rule of Thirds
After you find a focal point for your
shot, the next step is to try to put
that focal point, or subject, in a
prime location within your
viewfinder or LCD display. Those
prime locations are based on the
photographic principle the rule of
thirds. If you divide an image into a
grid of nine equal segments, as
shown in Figure 17-2, the elements
most appealing to the eye and most
likely to be noticed first are those
that fall close to one of the four inter-
sections of the dividing lines.
When you’re composing your shot, try to mentally divide your frame into ver-
tical and horizontal thirds and position your most important visual element
at any intersecting point. When you’re shooting landscapes, remember that a
low horizon creates a dreamy and spacious feeling and that a high horizon
gives an earthy and intimate feeling. For close-up portraits, try putting the
face or eyes of a person at one of those points.
If the rule of thirds is too hard for you to remember or employ, when you look
through the viewfinder, just repeat the mantra “Move from center.” We all
have a natural tendency to want to center everything. Get it nice and orderly.
But centered subjects are often static and boring. Asymmetry often gives you
more dynamic and interesting images.
If you have an autofocus camera, you need to lock the focus when you’re
moving from center because the autofocus sensor locks on to whatever is in
the center of the viewfinder — not on your point of interest. Autofocus can also
be problematic when you’re trying to do something as simple as photograph-
ing two people (in this case, you may want the two people in the center) and
your camera keeps focusing on the space in the distance between them. Center
your subject in the viewfinder and apply slight pressure to your shutter release
button to lock the focus. Then, reposition your subject at an intersecting point
on the rule-of-thirds grid and press down all the way to snap the photo.
Cut the Clutter
Contrary to what you see on supermarket tabloid covers, those telephone
poles, branches, car antennas, and other everyday objects don’t naturally
grow out of people’s heads. Although these mergers, as photographers call
them, are good for a laugh, they’re not good enough to make it into picture
frames and scrapbooks.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Here are some ways you can cut the clutter from your background:
 Get up close and personal. Most people worry about getting their heads
cut off when they get their photos taken. But more often than not, people
tend to capture too much boring or distracting background. Fill your
viewfinder frame with your subject. Although you can always crop your
image later, you should try to get your subject to fill the frame when you
take the photo.
 Shoot at a different angle. Yes, you can turn your camera! Most photos
are horizontal merely because it’s easier to hold the camera that way.
That’s fine for a lot of shots (such as the requisite group photo and some
landscape shots), but other subjects (buildings, trees, waterfalls, moun-
tain peaks, giraffes, Shaquille O’Neal) lend themselves to a vertical format.
 Move around your subject. Moving around may help eliminate
unwanted clutter. Shoot from below or above your subject if necessary.
 Move your subject, if possible, to get the optimum background.
Although there are exceptions, an ideal background is usually free from
distracting elements like tree branches, poles, wires, chain-link fences,
signs, bright lights, lots of loud colors, busy wallpaper, and so on.
Include only what complements your subject.
 Use background elements to
enhance, not distract. On the
other hand, if your background
is interesting and can make your
photo stronger, include it. You
can use famous landmarks,
props, and even decorations 
in the background to give con-
text to images, as shown in
Figure 17-3.
 Use space around a subject to
evoke a certain mood. A lot of
space around a person can give
a sense of loneliness, just as a
closely cropped portrait can
create a feeling of intimacy.
Just make sure that the space is
intentionally used in the shot.
 If you’re stuck with a distracting background, you can try blurring it
by using a wider aperture (like f/4 rather than f/11 or f/16) on your
camera. This makes the depth of field (areas of sharpness in relation to
your focal point) shallower so that your subject is in focus but the back-
ground isn’t.
Figure 17-3: Use background elements, like
decorations, to help define an event and add
ambience to the subject.

Because consumer digital cameras use image sensors that are typically
one-third the size of a 35mm frame, the lens is very close to the sensor,
which really increases the depth of field. This can make it hard to blur
the background. Not a problem — you can also blur the background by
making a selection and using the Blur filter in Elements. See Chapters 7
and 10 for more on selections and the Blur filter, respectively.
Frame Your Shot
When it’s appropriate, use foreground elements
to frame your subject. Frames lead you into a
photograph. You can use elements like tree
branches, windows, archways, and doorways to
frame a wide or long shot, add a feeling of depth,
and create a point of reference, as shown in
Figure 17-4. You don’t have to reserve the use
of framing for wide and long shots, however.
Close-ups can also be framed. Your framing ele-
ments don’t always have to be sharply focused.
Sometimes, if they’re too sharp, they distract
from the focal point. And, remember to avoid
mergers!
Employ Contrast
Just remember “Light on dark, dark on light.” 
A light subject has more impact and emphasis 
if it’s shot against a dark back-
ground, and vice versa, as shown in
Figure 17-5. When people view an
image, their eyes go first to the area
of the most contrast. Obviously, find-
ing contrast in the environment is
sometimes beyond your control. But
when you’re setting up a shot, you
can certainly try to incorporate this 
technique. Keep in mind, however,
that contrast needs to be used 
carefully. Sometimes it can be dis-
tracting, especially if the high-
contrast elements aren’t your main
point of interest.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Using Leading Lines
Leading lines are lines that, by either
the actual elements in the image or
the composition of those elements,
lead the eye into the picture and,
hopefully, to a point of interest.
These lines add dimension, depth,
and perspective by carrying the eye
through the photo:
 Diagonal lines are dynamic and
evoke movement.
 Curves are graceful and 
harmonious.
 Horizontal lines are peaceful
and give a feeling of balance.
 Vertical lines are direct and
active.
The best leading lines are those that
enter the image from the lower-left
corner. Many elements provide nat-
ural leading lines, especially in
scenic or landscape photos, such as
roads, walls, fences, rivers, shadows,
skyscrapers, and bridges. The photo
shown in Figure 17-6 of the Great
Wall of China is an example of curved
leading lines.
Experiment with Viewpoints
Not much in the world looks fascinating photographed from a height of 5 to 6
feet off the ground. Unfortunately, this is the viewpoint of “Snapshotville.”
Try to break out of this mode by taking photos from another vantage point.
Experiment with taking a photo from above the subject (bird’s-eye view) or
below it (worm’s-eye view). A different angle may provide a more interesting
image:
Flat Earth
Figure 17-6: You don’t have to trek to China to
find leading lines, although you may not find a
longer unbroken curve than the Great Wall.

 Unexpected angles can exag-
gerate the size of the subject.
The subject may appear either
larger or smaller than normal,
as shown in Figure 17-7. Try
extreme angles with scenic
shots, which otherwise can tend
to be rather static or boring.
 Changing your viewpoint can
change the mood of the image.
If the photo in Figure 17-7 had
been taken from a front angle, it
would have been pretty dull.
Taken from below, looking up,
exaggerates the height and
makes for a stronger and more
exciting composition, making
the cactus seem like nature’s
skyscraper.
 Use direct eye contact when
you’re photographing people.
It provides a sense of realism
and makes the image more inti-
mate and warm, pulling you into
the photo. But remember that
children are not at the same eye
level as adults. We often shoot
down at them, making them
appear smaller than they really are. Try kneeling or sitting on the floor
and getting down to their level. You will also find that you get a less dis-
tracting background in the frame, and the lighting from your flash more
evenly covers the face. Do the same for pets and other short-stature
subjects, such as flowers.
Use Light
When we think of light in regard to photography, the first thing that comes 
to mind are all those photos we took in the past that are either overexposed
(too light) or underexposed (too dark). With lighting, you have to consider not
only whether you have the right amount of lighting, but also these factors:
 The direction of the light
 The intensity of the light

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 The color of the light
 Natural light (outdoors) or artificial light (indoors)
 Creative use of lighting to lead the eye and create a certain mood
If the light isn’t right for your shot, you have quite a few choices: Hurry up
and wait, move yourself, move the subject, add more light with a flash, or dif-
fuse light. Of course, which one you choose depends on the circumstances of
the shot and what’s convenient or most productive. Here are a few tips to
remember about light:
 The best light for photographs is in the early morning and later after-
noon. The light is warmer and softer, and the shadows are longer and
less harsh.
 Avoid taking portraits at midday. The overhead sun causes ugly shadows
and makes people squint. If you must shoot then, use a reflector to block
some of the sunlight or fill in the shadow areas. Or, you can use a scrim
(white translucent fabric stretched across a frame) to diffuse the light.
 Cloudy or overcast days can be great for photographing, especially
portraits. The light is soft and diffused and flatters the face.
 Shooting subjects with backlighting (where the lighting comes from
behind the subject) can produce dramatic results. Figure 17-8 shows an
example. If you want to see the details of the subject, and not just a sil-
houette, use a fill flash to lighten the shadow areas.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 17-8: Backlighting can yield dramatic images.

 Ensure that the brightest light source isn’t directed right into the lens.
This causes lens flare, those strange light circles that appear in the
photo.
 Take into account the color of the light. The
light at noon is white, the light at sunset is
orange, and the light at twilight is blue. The
color of the light can make an image feel
warm or cool.
 Use a flash when necessary. Use a flash in
low-light conditions. If your built-in flash
isn’t cutting the mustard, you may want to
invest in an accessory flash.
 Get creative with light. Look for those
unique compositions created by the inter-
play between light and shadow areas or how
the light illuminates a particular subject.
Lighting by itself can make or break a certain
mood or emotion. Think of a simple beam of
light coming through the roof of an old barn.
Even in the lousiest weather, the most beau-
tifully lit images can emerge. When wet
objects are lit, they seem to shimmer, as
shown in Figure 17-9.
Giving Direction
When you look at magazines that feature the year’s best photos, they all
appear as instances of pure serendipity. Sometimes that’s the case, but more
often than not, the photographer
arranged the shot or waited for the
right light or a special moment.
As a photographer, you also 
shouldn’t be afraid to play photo
stylist:
 Give directions on where you
want people to stand, how to
stand, and so on. For example,
tell people to touch each other,
bring their heads toward each
other, or put their arms around
each other, as shown in Fig-
ure 17-10.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 Designate the location.
 Use props, such as trees or cars, to arrange people around.
 Use a variety of poses. Have some people sit and others stand.
 If you’re dealing with a large group of people, rambunctious kids, or
excited pets, get someone to help direct. Just make sure that the parties
being photographed pay attention and look at the camera.
 Try to get people to relax. Although spontaneity can yield great images,
you can still get good photos from posed subjects if they aren’t hating
the experience.
Consider Direction of Movement
When the subject is capable of move-
ment, such as a car, person, or
animal, make sure that you leave
more space in front of the subject
than behind it, as shown in Fig-
ure 17-11. Otherwise, the viewer may
subconsciously experience a feeling
of departure or discomfort. You want
to try to give the person or object
room to move into the frame. Like-
wise, if a person is looking out onto 
a vista, make sure that you include
that vista so that the person is given
a point of view and the scene is 
given context.

S
o you posted all your holiday and vacation photos in a Web gallery and
made enough albums, slide shows, flipbooks, and cards to keep your
family and friends content for months to come? Sounds like you may be ready
to take a crack at some other projects. In this chapter, you find some ideas on
how you can use your inventory of digital images to make your life
more productive, more organized, and more fun. Remember
that this chapter just scratches the surface. With a little
imagination, before you know it, there won’t be anything
left in your life that doesn’t include your photos.
Wallpaper and Screen Savers
If you like an image so much that you want to gaze
at it while you’re toiling away at your computer, why
not use that image for the background of your com-
puter, better known as the desktop wallpaper? If you
can’t choose just one favorite image, you can use several
to create a multi-image screen saver.
If you’re serious about image editing, you really should have a neu-
tral gray background. But as long as your wallpaper isn’t showing while you do
your color corrections, feel free to decorate your desktop with your favorite
colorful photo. You use just two easy steps to turn a photo into wallpaper:
1. From the Organizer, select the photo you want to use.
2. Choose Edit➪Set As Desktop Wallpaper.

in the Color Picker and then
click OK.
3. Open your photos and drag
and drop them onto your new
canvas with the Move tool.
Make sure to choose Window➪
Cascade to view all your can-
vases at the same time.
Your image is automatically put
on a separate layer. For more on
layers, see Chapter 8. If you
want to use only a portion of the
image, as we did with the puppy
in Figure 18-1, use your favorite
selection method to pluck out
your element. For more on selec-
tions, see Chapter 7.
4. Select the Type tool, click the
canvas, and add your desired type. Position your type with the
Move tool.
5. When you’re done, choose File➪Save.
6. Choose Photoshop (.PSD) from the Format drop-down menu (Format
pop-up menu on the Mac), and make sure that the Layers and Color
check boxes are selected. In addition, select the Use Lower Case
Extension option. Click Save.
If you want to take your document to a service bureau or copy shop, 
like FedEx Kinko’s, you should save your document as a Photoshop PDF
(.pdf) file. That way, you don’t have to worry about compatibility issues
or printing snafus.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
If you’re preparing photos for online auction sites, like eBay or Yahoo!
Auctions, be sure and keep your images at a low resolution — 72 ppi, to be
exact — and at 100 percent scale. Save the file as a JPEG to ensure that your
file stays lean and mean while preserving colors. Be sure to check the image
specifications posted on your online auction site.
Clothes, Hats, and More
Many local copy shops, retail stores, and Web sites enable you to add photos
to T-shirts, hats, buttons, tote bags, ties, mouse pads, and many other items.
If you can produce it, they can put a photo on it. But it’s easy, and less expen-
sive, to tackle this project yourself.
Buy plain white T-shirts at your local discount store or plain aprons and tote
bags at your craft or fabric store. Then buy special transfer paper at your
office supply or computer store. Print your photos on the transfer paper (be
sure to flip the images horizontally first) and iron the print onto the fabric,
and you’ve got yourself a personalized gift for very little cash.
What do you get for the person who has everything? How about a blanket of
memories? You can transfer photos onto patches of fabric and create unique
memory quilts. What grandparent wouldn’t love to have a quilt with photos
of her children and grandchildren?
Posters
For special events, important announcements, or maybe just your favorite
family photos, you can get posters and large-size prints at many copy shops
and service bureaus. Call and talk to a knowledgeable rep at your copy shop
or service bureau so that you know exactly how to prepare your file. Here are
a few questions to ask:
 What file format and resolution should the file be?
 What print sizes do you offer?
 Do you provide mounting and lamination services?
In addition to printing large prints, many service bureaus mount prints
on foam core or the sturdier gator board. These service bureaus also can
laminate prints to protect them from scratches and UV rays.

Household and Business Inventories
Don’t wait for a natural disaster or theft to get
you motivated to prepare an inventory of your
household or business assets. Take your digital
camera and shoot pictures of your items. Add
text to describe the items in the caption section
of the Organizer. Be sure to include the makes,
models, purchase dates, and dollar values of each
piece. Then create a single PDF document from
those multiple files by creating a slide show or an
album, as shown in Figure 18-2. Upload the PDF
file to a Web storage site, or burn a CD or DVD
and place it off-site in a safety deposit box or
other secure location. If the need arises, the PDF
can be viewed by your insurance agent using the
free Adobe Reader software.
Project Documentation
Nothing helps to document a process like images. The spoken word and the
written word are great, but showing how something comes together is even
more effective. Consider using your photographs to help document your 
projects from beginning to end. Whether it’s a project involving home improve-
ment, furniture building, crafts, or cooking, take photos at each stage to record
the project. If you’re taking a class or
workshop and the instructors don’t
mind, take your camera to class.
Documenting the positions or steps
of that new yoga, pottery, or garden-
ing class will help you practice or 
re-create it on your own later, either
for yourself or to teach someone else.
Import the photos into the Organizer
and create notes on each step of the
project, either on the canvas itself
or in the caption area. Output the
images to a PDF slide show or a PDF
file of album pages, as shown in
Figure 18-3.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
School Reports and Projects
There’s nothing like some interesting photos to jazz up the obligatory school
report. Doing a botany report? Include some close-ups of a flower with text
labels on the parts of the flower. Have to write a paper on the habits of the
lemurs of Madagascar? Trek down to your local zoo and have a photo shoot.
Create a simple collage of lemurs eating, sleeping, and doing the other things
that lemurs do. In fact, buying your children their own inexpensive point-and-
shoot cameras may give them a little more enthusiasm for school work.
Wait — There’s More
Before you start taking your photos to the next dimension, here are a few
extra ideas: Make fun place cards for dinner party guests, create your own
business cards if you need only a few, design your own gift wrap and tags, 
or label storage boxes with photos of their contents. The possibilities are
endless.
Sharing projects
Not into killing trees? Not to worry. You don’t
have to print every project you make. Any file
you create can be left as a purely digital file and
e-mailed to other users. From the Organizer, you
can select files that you want to send to recipi-
ents and choose File➪E-mail.
In the Attach to E-mail dialog box, from the
Format menu, you have these options for send-
ing your file: Photo Mail (HTML), Simple Slide
Show (PDF), and Individual Attachments. The
first option saves the file as HTML that may be
used for a Web page design. Other options are
to send the photo as a PDF file or as a file
attachment to an e-mail message. Additionally,
you have options for editing your address book,
selecting image quality, and downsampling
(PDF or attachments only). You can add a mes-
sage here, or you can choose to type text in
your new e-mail message, as shown in the
figure.
If you happen to choose Photo Mail as your
format, you have additional layout options to
choose, such as frames, borders, background
color, and shadows.
Click the Next button, and the file (according to
the format you choose) is attached to a new
e-mail message in your default e-mail program.
