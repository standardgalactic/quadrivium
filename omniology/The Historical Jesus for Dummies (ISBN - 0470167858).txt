Dedication
This book is lovingly dedicated to my family, to Kate McNichols and
Bess Murphy; to Jen, Andrew, Ian, and Neil Moore; to Eileen, Stephan,
Will, and Aaron Georis; and to Tim, Diane, Zoe, and Erin Murphy.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge the many colleagues who have taught me
about the historical Jesus and first-century Judaism, from my mentors
at the University of Notre Dame to the members of the Catholic Biblical
Association and the Society of Biblical Literature. Their insights and
hard work fill these pages. In particular, I relied on the work of John P.
Meier, Amy-Jill Levine, Fabian E. Udoh, Seth Schwartz, Warren Carter,
Paula Fredriksen, Jonathan Klawans, Thomas F. Matthews, Lloyd
Baugh, Jerome Murphy-O’Connor, and Mary Rose D’Angelo.
Thanks, too, to my colleagues and relatives who were gracious
enough to read this whole book ahead of time and offer suggestions,
especially my “alpha dummy,” Bess Murphy, Kate McNichols, Dr.
Cynthia M. Baker (Santa Clara University), and Dr. Susan A. Calef
(Creighton University). Other colleagues at Santa Clara University
who generously offered help with certain sections include Dr.
Frederick Parrella, Dr. David Pinault, Dr. Tom Beaudoin, Dr. James
Bennett, Dr. David Gray, Dr. J. David Pleins, and Fr. Paul Soukup, SJ.
Special and sincere thanks are also due to the Wiley Publishing team.
I’m especially grateful to Georgette Beatty, whose encouragement
and diligence made the entire editorial process smooth and fun.
Jessica Smith carefully corrected every single word. Her keen
awareness of audience helped make this a much better book. Mike
Baker helped get the project in motion and stood behind it all the
way. Dr. Clayton N. Jefford provided a lot of feedback that helped me
rethink several sections and correct some errors. Finally, thanks to
Alissa Schwipps, who helped shepherd the draft manuscript into
production, and everyone else on the Wiley team who helped with
this book.
Students in my classes at Santa Clara University have shaped the
presentation of this material more than they might realize. I espe-
cially want to single out my research assistant, Kristin Williams,
who helped investigate some of the sidebar topics, and my colleagues
in the Department of Religious Studies and the faculty at large,
whose support for this project and good humor reflect their love
of teaching and scholarship.

Introduction
Jesus of Nazareth is one of the most famous men in human
history. People have followed him, died for him, prayed to him,
and even wondered what kind of car he would drive. But for all the
faith that he’s inspired, people still have a lot of questions about
who he really was.
Those questions began during Jesus’s own life. Heck, even Jesus
wondered, “Who do people say that I am?” (Mark 8:27). Four gospels
and two millennia later, people definitely have different views of
what Jesus was like; what he thought, did, and taught; and why he
died. You start to wonder whether it’s possible to sort through all
the competing beliefs and all the perspectives of modern faith and
past eras to recover the Jewish man who lived a short 30-plus years
in a poor provincial backwater of the Roman Empire.
I’ve had the opportunity to study the history, travel to Jesus’s
homeland, learn the ancient languages, and even read some of the
newly discovered scrolls that shed light on Judaism in Jesus’s time.
All these experiences have helped me shape a better picture of
Jesus’s life in my mind. I’ve written this book so that you can have all
this scholarship in your hands in plain English. You may not have
the time (or the will!) to master ancient Greek, read a Dead Sea
Scroll in Hebrew, or take a trip to Jerusalem. But my hope is that
after you have read this book you’ll feel like you have.
About This Book
People are interested in Jesus for a lot of different reasons, and you’re
no different. You may be reading this book because you’re a firm
Christian believer looking to find out what biblical historians are
saying. You may have picked it up because you’re a history buff and
want to know more about the state of the evidence. Maybe you’ve
seen a movie or read a book that has sparked your curiosity about
Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Or maybe you’ve just stood one too
many times in the religion aisle at the bookstore, feeling amazed by
the number of books and wondering where in the world to begin.
Whatever your reasons for wanting to know more about Jesus, The
Historical Jesus For Dummies was written for you. It’s designed for
people who have never read a book about Jesus in their life, but it
should also be interesting for those who have.

Here’s what you can expect from this book:
 Quick overviews of the biblical story of Jesus, current beliefs
about him, and depictions of him in art and film
 Clear explanations of the rules that biblical historians use to
reconstruct Jesus’s life
 Readable summaries of the three quests for the historical Jesus
 Maps, charts, and photos to help you track the action
 Insights into the history, society, economics, politics, and
religious beliefs in Jesus’s time
 Explorations of Jesus’s life, teachings, deeds, and crucifixion
One of the best things about this book is that you decide where to
start and what to read. It’s a reference you can jump into and out
of at will. Just head to the table of contents or the index to find the
information you want.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make
things consistent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an
easy-to-understand definition.
 Bold is used to highlight key words in bulleted lists and the
action parts of numbered steps.
When mentioning dates, I use the designations BCE (before the
common era) and CE (common era). This may surprise you in a
book about Jesus, because the old designations BC (before Christ)
and AD (from the Latin anno Domini, or “year of our Lord”) are lit-
erally named after Jesus! I use this designation for a couple of rea-
sons. First of all, Jesus was most likely born somewhere between 6
and 4 BC, which would be 6 to 4 years “before Christ.” Talk about
confusing! But more importantly, not everyone who uses the
Western calendar is Christian, and it’s more gracious to use termi-
nology that everyone can agree on.
You may also notice that I avoid referring to God as a male, so I don’t
use male pronouns like He and Him and His. I’m following the Bible’s
lead on this issue. After all, if God made humans in the divine image,
male and female (Genesis 1:27), God obviously can’t be one or the
other. Jesus often calls God his Father, or Abba (Mark 14:36; Romans

8:15), but he also speaks of God’s Wisdom (Luke 7:35), which is
gendered feminine in Greek and Hebrew.
As you may know, the Bible is composed of many books written by
different authors at different times. So when I cite the Bible, I
follow the usual convention of referring first to the name of the
book and then to the chapter and verse on either side of a colon.
For example, that banner that reads “John 3:16” and shows up at
every football game refers to the gospel of John, chapter 3, verse
16. If I have to refer to several verses, I separate them with a dash
(John 20:30–31). Also, if I have to refer to several chapters within
the same book, I separate those with a semicolon (John 9:34;
14:23).
There are a lot of passages in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke
that are almost identical to each other, so sometimes I use a symbol
of parallel lines (||) to indicate that these are parallel passages (for
example, Mark 12:28–34 || Matthew 22:34–40 || Luke 10:25–28).
When the parallels are found only in Matthew and Luke, I list just
those two (for example, Matthew 8:18–22 || Luke 9:57–62) or call
them “Q 9:57–62” (following Luke’s chapter and verse) because
scholars think that these passages rely on a shared source called Q
(you can read all about Q in Chapters 3 and 5).
I should also mention that we really don’t know who the authors of
the gospels are; the names Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are tra-
ditionally attached, but none of the authors signed their work and
none of the earliest manuscripts has an author’s name. Therefore, I
usually refer to “the author of Mark,” but sometimes I write “Mark
says” just for ease of reference.
Because this book is about historical evidence, I often have to cite
authors and books that you’ve probably never heard of. To help
make this type of info as clear as possible, I always give you the
author’s name, the title of his work, and the book, chapter, and
paragraph information. This way you can track it down if you’re
feeling adventurous. For example, “Josephus, Jewish Antiquities
18.3.3” refers to Josephus’s Jewish Antiquities, and you can find the
info I’m referring to in book 18, chapter 3, paragraph 3.
Finally, the translations from the ancient authors and from the
Bible are my own, straight out of the original Hebrew and Greek.
They’ll no doubt sound a little different from your Bible. I recommend
having your own copy of the Bible nearby so that you can check the
evidence directly yourself. Why? Because even though modern Bibles
aren’t the original text, translation differences can sometimes signal
ancient textual problems, modern denominational differences, and
all kinds of other interesting issues.

What You’re Not to Read
The point of this book is to help you understand whatever it is that
you’re trying to find out. In other words, you probably won’t read
it cover to cover. If you’re in a hurry, you can also always skip the
following nonessential stuff:
 Text in sidebars: The sidebars are the shaded boxes that
appear here and there throughout the chapters. They offer
interesting or informative bits of trivia, but they aren’t neces-
sary for your understanding of the historical Jesus.
 Anything with a Technical Stuff icon attached to it: This
information is interesting and provides technical jargon that’s
important in historical Jesus research, but you can easily
understand the topic without it.
Foolish Assumptions
I don’t know you, but I did try to imagine who you might be before I
wrote this book. Here’s what I assume about you, the reader:
 You want to find out about Jesus, and you may (or may not)
be Christian.
 You may have some background in historical or biblical studies,
but maybe not both. Perhaps you’re taking a religious 
studies course on the life of Jesus.
 You want a book that explains the issues in simple terms but
with adequate detail.
 You’re looking for a book that lets you judge the evidence but
doesn’t shy away from taking positions.
 You’re open to new discoveries and different worldviews.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts that each deal with a different
aspect of the historical Jesus. Here’s what you find in each part.
Part I: Piecing Together 
the Jesus Story
Part I provides a quick overview of the gospel story of Jesus. It
explores the idea that the gospels don’t provide history, and it gives

you some tools that you can use to sift history from the texts that
have survived. This part is where you find all the major evidence
for Jesus in literary and archaeological sources.
Part II: Reconstructing 
the World of Jesus
Part II explores the Jewish and Greco-Roman worlds into which
Jesus was born. You watch Rome secure its hold on Palestine, you
explore local political systems, Jewish religious beliefs, social
networks, and cultural values, and you see how Romans and Jews
clashed and worked together. This background info goes a long way
toward explaining Jesus’s message, his popularity, and his death.
Part III: Exploring the 
Life of Jesus the Jew
Part III takes a close look at the gospels and the external evidence
that helps you to begin reconstructing the life of Jesus. You examine
his birth and childhood, you see what can be said about the move-
ment that grew around him, and you study his teachings and deeds
to determine what most likely happened during his life.
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s 
Execution and Resurrection
This part examines who opposed Jesus and why he was killed. It
focuses on the fact that Rome executed Jesus as a king and explores
how and why some leading Jews would have collaborated with the
Roman prefect. It also explores traditions of Jesus’s resurrection
and how Jesus came to be known as the Messiah and son of God.
Part V: Experiencing 
Christ in Culture
Part V surveys Jesus from antiquity to our own modern day. It
looks at the major developments in how Jesus has been viewed in
prayer, piety, and politics, and then it revisits these trends by trac-
ing them in art. The final chapter in this part surveys some of the
most important films about Jesus in the past 100 years.

Part VI: The Part of Tens
The final part is a special feature of all For Dummies books. Here,
you find fun lists that are quick and to the point (but chock-full of
info!). I include the top ten controversies about Jesus over the
years and the top ten pilgrimage sites associated with his life.
Icons Used in This Book
To make this book easier to read and simpler to use, I include
some icons that can help you find different types of information.
This icon flags ancient debates or contemporary issues that scholars
continue to wrestle with.
This icon signals discussions of new discoveries (within the last
century or so) by scholars.
This icon highlights the information that’s essential to understand-
ing the historical Jesus. These paragraphs include the basic rules
and information that you should take away, even if you remember
nothing else.
This icon appears next to information that’s interesting but not
essential.
Where to Go from Here
This book is organized so that you can go wherever you want to
find whatever it is that you’re looking for. You don’t need to read
one chapter before another. For instance, want to jump right in and
see why Jesus was crucified? Head straight to Chapter 14. Maybe
you want to start on a lighter note, in which case Part V is your
best bet. Use the table of contents to find broad categories of infor-
mation or the index to look up more specific things.
If you aren’t sure where you want to go, you may want to start with
Part I. It sets up the gospel stories and gets you oriented for your
own quest into the life of the historical Jesus.
One last tip: The New Testament, which is the primary source on
the historical Jesus, makes loads of references to the Jewish scrip-
tures (called the Old Testament by Christians and Tanakh by Jews).
If you aren’t familiar with the Bible, you may find The Bible For
Dummies by Jeffrey Geoghegan, PhD, and Michael Homan, PhD,
(Wiley) to be a helpful backup for this book.

Part I
Piecing Together the
Jesus Story

In this part . . .
T
he story of Jesus that has been told for 2,000 years has
always been a mixture of fact and faith. In the gospels
(which provide most of the evidence for the life of Jesus),
beliefs shaped the details of his life, and Jesus’s life in turn
shaped the beliefs. But in the last few centuries, as these
later beliefs have come under question, some people have
sought to recover the historical life of Jesus stripped of
centuries of interpretation.
In this part, you enter that quest. You discover who Jesus
was when he was alive and who he became after his death.
You then explore the gospels and ﬁnd out that the authors
weren’t primarily interested in giving an objective history
of Jesus. You also see how scholars tried to separate fact
from faith in the biblical books over the past 200 years.
Finally, you unearth the sources about Jesus that we have
from Christians, Jews, and Romans.

Chapter 1
Meeting the Man
from Nazareth
In This Chapter
 Exploring the Jesus stories in the gospels
 Questing for the evidence behind the stories
 Entering the world of the historical Jesus
 Tracking 2,000 years of talk about Jesus
Jesus is one of the best-known people in the world. Millions revere
his name, his ethics inspire imitation, his teachings continue to
challenge, and the biblical stories about him have been perennial
bestsellers. Not bad for an uneducated, Jewish carpenter from a
poor province of someone else’s empire!
So who was this man from Nazareth who lived from approximately
6 BCE to 30 CE? And who has he become in the 2,000 years since?
In this chapter, you discover not only who Christians think he is
today, but also who historians think he was during his life.
Telling the Good News
in the Gospels
Christians call the stories of Jesus “the good news,” or gospel (from
the Old English word godspel). This reference may surprise you if
you know that Jesus gets executed in the end. But for Christians,
the story doesn’t end there. In Christian belief, Jesus rose from the
dead. His followers had an experience that convinced them not
only that Jesus was still alive, but also that he had somehow
defeated death itself. And that was very good news indeed.
This gospel message is the faith that followers began to preach all
over the Mediterranean region and even to Persia and India. It’s the
faith that permeates their stories of Jesus after they set them down

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story

on parchment. In the following sections, I introduce you to the
main stories that give the good news — the gospels of Mark,
Matthew, Luke, and John in the Bible (Chapter 2 has the full scoop
on these stories) — as well as to other versions of the story you
won’t find in a Bible.
Sorting through the gospel versions
The gospel message of the earliest preachers was passed on orally
for several decades after Jesus’s death. People probably recorded
parts of the message right away, but our first evidence of written
material dates to the 50s CE, which is 20 years after Jesus’s death.
The earliest complete gospel, Mark’s story of Jesus’s ministry, exe-
cution, and resurrection, didn’t come out for another 15 to 25
years. The other three gospels in the Bible — Matthew, Luke, and
John — followed within a few decades.
Dozens of other gospels were written, but they were judged to be
too unorthodox or written too late to make the canonical cut. A
canon in Greek is a measuring stick; the term is used for books 
that “measure up” in some group’s judgment and in turn become
the measure for the worth of other books. (See Chapter 5 for 
more about the concept of canon.) These other gospels are worth
studying because they reveal interesting evidence of early Christian
thought and practice and may have some early material (see the
nearby sidebar “Exposing the hidden books”). But by and large, the
four gospels in the Bible remain our best and earliest sources for the
historical Jesus, even if they aren’t transparent histories themselves.
Revealing the gospels’ message
When they set their quills to parchment, the gospel authors didn’t
write abstract philosophical reflections about Jesus’s divine nature.
They told the story of a Jewish laborer who ate and breathed and
Exposing the hidden books
If you want to read the books that didn’t make it into the Bible, check out the
Noncanonical Literature page at Wesley Center Online (wesley.nnu.edu/
biblical_studies/noncanon). The Web site categorizes the books by
Testament (the Old Testament or the New Testament) and by the type of work (apoc-
rypha, which are hidden books, or pseudepigrapha, which are writings intention-
ally attributed to a “false” or ancient author). Scholars use print versions with more
updated translations, but this Web site is fine for beginners.

walked around, who got angry and felt compassion for people, and
who suffered and died, like so many prior Jewish prophets. These
authors weren’t church officials writing doctrine, and they weren’t
scholars writing sophisticated tomes. Instead, they were average
Joes writing stories in the common language that everyone could
understand. They infused these stories with their faith.
Because the gospels are about a man, modern folks are going to
ask historical questions about their main character, Jesus. But at
the same time, the gospels complicate any easy quest for answers
because they aren’t neutral. They’re evangelistic, which means that
their goal is to persuade you to believe their stories (evangelos is
Greek for “good news”). So, if you want to get the historical facts,
you can’t take these texts at face value.
The gospels were written fairly close to Jesus’s life — somewhere
between 35 and 70 years after his execution. However, you have to
remember that this many years is a significant time gap to a historian.
Preachers, teachers, and prophets had been interpreting Jesus’s
teachings and deeds and the significance of his death for all those
decades, and their later reflections inevitably crept into the stories
they wrote of his life. For a believer, this later reflection isn’t neces-
sarily a problem; in fact, it’s even a rich resource, because modern
Christians stand on the faith of those first followers. But for the
historian who wants to uncover the historical Jesus, those later
additions have to be identified and peeled away.
If that’s true of the gospels, it’s even truer of all the additional
beliefs about Jesus that have developed over the past 2,000 years.
So, this book about Jesus won’t just fill you in on the Jewish car-
penter, but also on who he’s become since. Think of Jesus as a
2,000-year-old building that everyone has been adding on to in
every era. Right now, you see the whole building. But after you can
identify the construction styles of each generation and how the
building is framed, you’ll be able to see its foundation more clearly.
Charting a Path Back to
the Historical Jesus
Even though the gospels aren’t exactly objective and historically
accurate (see the previous section for details), it is possible to 
use them (as well as other evidence inside and outside the New
Testament) to construct an account of the historical Jesus. You
just need to know a few ground rules that you can use when reading
the sources. I explain these rules in the following sections.
Chapter 1: Meeting the Man from Nazareth 11

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
12
Adopting a critical distance
For the most part, this book follows the conventions of historical
criticism to recover the historical Jesus. These conventions
require you to bracket any beliefs you may have so that you can
enter Jesus’s world as a virtual visitor.
You can never completely set aside your beliefs (and some would
say that you can’t do it at all!), because there’s really no way to read
anything without bringing your life experience to bear. You interpret
every word, every character, and every social, political, and
economic issue with your own vocabulary, relationships, experience,
and knowledge. If you’ve ever traveled to a foreign country, you
know both how your presuppositions are unavoidable and how
they can get you into trouble!
If you want to really experience a foreign culture — or, in our case,
the historical Jesus — you need to assume that there’s a difference
between this other world you’re entering and your own world.
Scholars call this critical distance. Critical here doesn’t mean nit-
picky or mean-spirited; it means that you’re aware of the differ-
ences and you’re open to thinking about them.
Telling the difference between 
faith and fact
One important thing you have to do to sketch the story of the his-
torical Jesus is to get a working idea of what the gospel writers
believed (I introduce the gospels and their authors earlier in this
chapter). It’s pretty clear that they believed Jesus rose from the
dead and is the son of God. But did anyone believe that during his
life? Did they expect that he would rise from the dead? Did they
call him the messiah? Those of you familiar with the gospels know
that the characters in the stories do say these things about Jesus
during his life. But did they really say this, or did the later gospel
writers introduce their faith, their debates with the Jews, and their
attitudes toward the Roman Empire into their stories of Jesus’s
life? To answer that question, you have to be able to tell the differ-
ence between biblical statements and historical facts.
This is tough for people who believe that the Bible is inerrant
because they trust that the biblical stories don’t err in matters of
faith or history. For them, if you say the Bible is “true,” that means
its words correspond directly to objective reality. Because our era
identifies “truth” with scientific or historical facts, the Bible must
be scientifically and historically factual if it’s “true.” But unlike sci-
entific method, this view starts with a conclusion rather than a

hypothesis: The Bible is true, which is why it must be factually
true. (Earlier eras had more expansive notions of what “truth” was
because they often distinguished between the literal, ethical, and
spiritual meanings of a text.)
Scientists, on the other hand, prefer to put every notion to the test.
For them, no “truth” is privileged in advance. All notions have to
be tested against the evidence, and the results have to be reproduced
by many people to reduce the possibility of bias and error.
After the Enlightenment, many biblical and literary critics tried to
follow the scientists. They performed close studies at the literal
and historical level and analyzed how texts shaped and were shaped
by their cultures. This analysis was the spirit behind the whole
quest for the historical Jesus (see Chapter 4 for details about
scholars’ different quests). The ethical implications of the Bible
and the issues about the deeper, enduring truths in scripture were
largely left to theologians and pastors. However, remember that I’m
oversimplifying a good bit here, because a lot of people tried to
keep one foot in each world.
In the last century, this whole historical quest and the “science” of
objective inquiry on which it was built have come under scrutiny.
Nowadays, many people realize that science and belief aren’t the
mutually exclusive categories that the Enlightenment imagined,
and that the pictures we paint of the past often say more about the
painter than the subject (thank you, Sigmund Freud!). Nevertheless,
we do have evidence from past eras, and we have to find ways to
deal with it, especially when it concerns a figure as important to
world history as Jesus of Nazareth.
Applying a few important 
rules to the evidence
A good deal of evidence about Jesus exists, and it doesn’t all come
from Christians. For instance, there are Jewish and Roman records
from the first couple of centuries that speak about Jesus briefly
(see Chapter 5). These sources are biased, too, but not in the same
ways as the gospels. So, they not only provide important confirma-
tion of some basic facts, but they also provide some interesting
additional evidence to boot.
On top of the literary evidence, a limited number of archaeological
artifacts related to the historical Jesus exist as well. Very few have
been found that are directly tied to Jesus, but those that have been
discovered shed light on the Jewish world at the time. They also
confirm the major players and the basic historical timeline that the
gospels presuppose.
Chapter 1: Meeting the Man from Nazareth 13

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
14
In the end, though, the best and fullest evidence for Jesus is the
gospels. If you’re going to recover the historical Jesus, they pro-
vide the clearest path. But because the gospels tell stories infused
with their present faith, you have to use the following few tricks of
the trade, as I explain further in Chapter 3:
 Get the earliest testimony: To do this, you need to figure out
the earliest gospel and the earliest parts of the gospels. Ideally,
this material would come from eyewitnesses, but that isn’t
always possible.
 Trust the embarrassing stuff: If something’s awkward for an
author to tell you and he does anyway, it’s likely to be true.
 It has to make sense of the crucifixion: It’s undeniable that
Jesus died at the hands of the Romans in the gruesome manner
of death that’s reserved for criminals. So, whatever you say
about his life has to be consistent with this kind of death.
 Someone has to report it: If you think it but no early source
says it, you win the prize for imagination, but not for history.
 The more independent witnesses that report it, the better:
The gospels aren’t always independent of each other. Matthew
and Luke, for example, probably had Mark’s gospel sitting
right in front of them when they were writing. But we do have
at least four early, independent sources, as Chapter 5 lays out.
 If it’s different either from earlier Jewish tradition or later
Christian teaching, it may be original and authentic: When
some bit of evidence disagrees with these traditions, the story
is unusual, which may mean that it’s original (see Chapter 5
for the problems with this idea).
These are the rules that scholars have been using for a couple of
centuries to sift through the gospel evidence for the artifacts of
Jesus’s history.
Surveying the Life and
Times of Jesus
The challenge of discovering the historical Jesus in the gospels is
to paint a portrait of a Jewish man that fits the historical context of
Jewish society in first century CE Roman Palestine. Fortunately,
archaeological discoveries and surviving first-century books about
the region and its history help flesh out the bare bones. In the fol-
lowing sections, I sketch out the regional background for you and
fill in some basic facts that we can gather about the historical
Jesus from the gospels.

Roman rule in Jewish lands
One common theme in the current quest for the historical Jesus is
to appreciate the Palestinian Jewish context and the Roman impe-
rial world in which Jesus lived (see Chapter 3 for more on this quest
and Part II for the Roman and Jewish background). Using this type
of information helps historians decide on the most plausible portrait
of Jesus when they’re dealing with conflicting evidence.
For example, we now know that King Herod the Great, the Jewish
client king of Rome who probably reigned when Jesus was born,
created a lot of prosperity in his kingdom and made Jerusalem a
magnificent city and a magnet for pilgrims. But he was also a cruel
man, a second-generation convert to Judaism, and a collaborator
with Rome. As you can imagine, he wasn’t exactly your ideal Jewish
king — not with that track record. However, there’s no doubt that
both his successes and his failures quickened the hopes of the
Jews. After all, their prophets had told them to expect a kingdom of
true prosperity and justice, and Herod came close.
After Herod’s death, his kingdom passed in three unequal portions
to three of his sons. Herod Archelaus, ruling in the southern region
of Judea, couldn’t manage it, so the Romans took over direct con-
trol of Judea in 6 CE. They appointed a Roman prefect to run things,
and he handpicked the Jewish high priest so that Rome could be
sure of a steady ally in the position beholden to them. The prefect
during Jesus’s adult life was Pontius Pilate. He executed Jesus with
the collaboration of Jewish leaders. The reasons Rome and its allies
took Jesus out weren’t only or even primarily religious, but political:
If the Jewish crowd massed behind Jesus, it would mean war, loss of
life, and loss of power for those in charge.
So why do the gospels, especially the later ones, blame the entire
Jewish people for Jesus’s execution? The gospel authors’ animosity
toward the Jewish people reflects political and religious developments
in the late first century, not the circumstances during Jesus’s life.
This single unhistorical tradition contributed to two millennia of
horrific Christian violence against Jews — so there’s a lot at stake in
trying to set the record straight.
You’ll be able to make better judgments yourself after reading Part
II. It has the full scoop on the world of Jesus, including a snapshot
of Jewish society and the influence of Rome in Palestine.
Leading a godly movement
We don’t know much at all about Jesus’s birth or childhood. In fact,
only two gospels describe it — those of Matthew and Luke — and
Chapter 1: Meeting the Man from Nazareth 15

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
16
their accounts are so different that it’s difficult to tell which one is
correct (Chapter 9 covers these stories). We do know, however,
that Jesus was named Yeshua in Aramaic (Joshua in Hebrew;
“Jesus” is the anglicized form of the Greek version).
We also know that as an adult, the historical Jesus was a faithful
Jew (see Chapters 7 and 11). He was linked to John the Baptist’s
movement and received baptism himself. We also know that he
gathered male and female followers, and that he likely designated
12 of the men as a kind of inner circle (called the Twelve), symbol-
izing his vision of the restoration of Israel (centuries before, it had
been a unified country of 12 tribes). Jesus taught a strict code of
ethics, but he also welcomed the sinner. He judged, but the final
judgment was deferred to allow time for mercy. He promoted a law,
and its core was Jewish law: The love of God and the love of neighbor
extended to the love of enemy. These features characterized the
coming reign of God, and he thought that it was coming soon.
Jesus also had a reputation as a miracle worker. Unfortunately, mir-
acles are difficult for our modern minds to grasp because we tend
to think that nature operates in predictable patterns, and when it
doesn’t, it’s only because we don’t know the pattern yet. Folks in
Jesus’s time had a different way of viewing the universe, and in
that world miracles were possible (see Chapter 12 for details). In
Jesus’s case, the gospel view is that his healings demonstrate not
only his power, but also the kind of kingdom that God wants. And
that kingdom, as in Jewish scriptures, is a place where the blind
see, the lame walk, and the poor are relieved from their burdens.
Going to the cross and
rising from the tomb
One of the most certain facts about the historical Jesus is that he
was crucified on the cross by the Romans in collaboration with a
small group of leading Jewish aristocrats. Why he was targeted for
this particular death penalty is the subject of Chapters 13 and 14.
After showing Jesus’s execution, the gospels end with the story of
his resurrection from the dead. On Sunday, the first day of the Jewish
week (Sunday is the first day of the week because the Jewish week
ends on the Sabbath, which is Saturday), Jesus’s disciples begin to
experience Jesus alive again. The accounts differ and the details
seem contradictory: Jesus can be touched, but he can also pass
through locked doors; he speaks and eats, but he can also suddenly
disappear. But the testimony of multiple independent witnesses,
the awkwardness of the conflicting testimony, and the sheer fact
that his followers become bold enough to preach suggest that
something momentous happened after his death.

Traveling through 2,000 Years 
of Beliefs in Jesus
Over 2,000 years and in so many different cultural contexts, beliefs in
Jesus have changed and grown, as you see in the following sections.
Debating Jesus’s divinity 
in late antiquity
In the first few centuries of Christianity, as the faith spread from
the Jewish milieu into the Greek- and Syriac-speaking East and the
Latin West, the central issues regarding Jesus were related to his
nature and his relationship to God (Chapter 15 spells out this issue).
As belief in Jesus’s divinity developed, it raised a philosophical
problem: How can the divine become human and stay mixed? Sure,
the Greeks and Romans had traditions of gods morphing into humans
and vice versa, but at any given time they were pretty much one or
the other, and they were either on earth or in the heavens. Christians,
on the other hand, were saying that Jesus was divine and human
fully and simultaneously — while he was on earth and even still today.
As if the human versus divine issue weren’t enough, Christians also
had to work out Jesus’s relationship to God. After all, Christians
didn’t want to be polytheists; they didn’t believe that there were
two gods (or three, if you count the Holy Spirit). But if they were
going to believe that Jesus was God, they needed language that
made it clear that there was still only one God. They found that
language in the doctrine of the Trinity — the mutual indwelling of
three persons.
These debates are just a few of the controversies about Jesus in
the past 2,000 years (see Chapter 19 for more).
Identifying with Jesus’s humanity
in the Middle Ages
The challenge of the earliest centuries was to figure out how Jesus
could be divine and human at the same time, but the emphasis
shifted in the Middle Ages. During this time, folks instead focused
on the humanity of Jesus. The awakening of humanism led to a
deep affection for the God who entered human flesh (see Chapter
16 for more on the human Jesus in the Middle Ages). Art and piety
followed suit, and soon were focused on Jesus’s vulnerability at
Chapter 1: Meeting the Man from Nazareth 17

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
18
birth in the crèche, his mother’s suffering, and his agony on the
way to the cross. (Chapter 17 covers the topic of Jesus in art.)
This cultivation of empathy was a style of prayer as much as it was a
way of making sense of human suffering. People consciously tried to
imitate the life of Christ through their actions and devotional
practices. This lifestyle and prayer style was practiced by many
believers who set out to walk in Jesus’s steps on pilgrimages to the
Holy Land (see Chapter 20 for some of these pilgrimage sites).
The great passion plays dramatizing Jesus’s death also began during
the Middle Ages. These plays had a huge impact on the films about
Jesus in our own time (Chapter 18 goes through more than 100 years
of Jesus in film).
Subjecting Jesus to scrutiny
The Reformation of the 16th and 17th centuries was built on the
medieval humanists’ goal to get back to the sources from antiquity.
Martin Luther had the same goal for the Bible. What he found was
that all sorts of differences existed between what Jesus had taught
and what Christianity had become. His effort to purge the Christian
tradition of all those “add-ons” and get back to scripture — along
with the subsequent Enlightenment interest in the objective study
of things — shaped the historical Jesus quest in our time (see
Chapter 4 for details on today’s quest).
Connecting with Jesus today
Today Jesus is a global phenomenon. People know about him
around the world, whether they’re Christian or not. Chapter 16
touches on how Jesus is viewed in other countries where people
don’t necessarily share the Western history of faith. Many of these
groups of people met Jesus through colonization, when Christianity
came hand in hand with the military forces of European empires.
That’s quite a turnaround, given that Jesus was himself a subject of
Rome and was executed by the empire of his day.
Because many people today meet Jesus in art and in film, this book
covers the arts as well (check out Chapters 17 and 18). Thousands
of pieces of art are dedicated to the Jesus story and more than 120
films have been produced about his life in the short history of cinema
(cinema has been around only since 1895, which means more than
one Jesus film a year so far!). You have many opportunities outside
this book to encounter the man from Nazareth, and I hope that this
book will be a helpful guide.

Comparing the Gospels: A
Biblical Biography of Jesus
In This Chapter
 Witnessing the birth of Jesus
 Examining his ties to John the Baptist
 Discovering what he taught and did
 Determining who followed and who opposed him
 Seeing why he was killed
T
he story of Jesus that’s told today is based on four stories that
were told 2,000 years ago. These four stories are the gospels
(from the old English word for “good news”). These gospels are like
biographies, telling the story of Jesus’s life and death, but they’re
also like sermons, preaching who the authors believed Jesus to be.
Because the gospel authors — Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John —
layered their stories with later beliefs, their biblical biographies of
Jesus aren’t exactly like a documentary film of Jesus’s life. In fact,
sometimes they don’t even agree with each other! But they do
share some basic details.
In this chapter, you discover what those basic details are, from
Jesus’s birth and his teachings and miracles to his death and resur-
rection. This snapshot of the gospels is the starting point for his-
torical Jesus research. The gospels are the best evidence available,
but they’re more like paintings than windows into his life.
Born to Be Different: The Birth
and Baptism of Jesus
Every story has a beginning, but every storyteller chooses where to
begin. In the four biblical stories of Jesus, each author starts at a
different place on the timeline. Mark, for example, opens with Jesus’s
adult life, and Luke, on the other hand, begins with his birth. Matthew

starts with a genealogy tracing Jesus through Jewish history, and
John jumps in at the beginning of the world. The themes in their
introductions set the stage for the rest of the story that, like the
opening, differs a good deal from gospel to gospel.
Away in a manger: The birth story
according to Matthew and Luke
Only two of the gospels, the stories of Matthew and Luke, give an
account of Jesus’s birth (see Chapter 9 for more on Jesus’s child-
hood). According to both of these gospels, Jesus was born to Mary
and Joseph in a village south of Jerusalem named Bethlehem.
Beyond that, they disagree on the precise date (see Chapter 9 for
the details). But the authors of Matthew and Luke weren’t as inter-
ested in the historical record as they were in establishing who they
thought Jesus was — they wanted to show his true identity.
There are more differences in their stories, too. Both Matthew and
Luke recount that divine signs accompanied Jesus’s conception and
birth, but the signs differ (contrast Matthew’s angelic revelation to
Joseph and star in the heavens to Luke’s angelic revelation to Mary
and choir of angels). Both of them paint Jesus as the promised mes-
siah or “anointed one,” but while Matthew emphasizes the contrast
to King Herod the Great, Luke emphasizes the salvation that this new
king will bring (flip to Chapter 7 for more on messiahs). Whereas
Matthew ties Jesus to Israel and its leaders of old (like Moses), Luke
ties Jesus to all peoples of the world. Luke’s genealogy traces Jesus
to Adam, the first human, and sets the occasion for his birth in
Roman rather than Jewish history (Luke 3:23–37; 2:1–7).
The baptism of Jesus and beyond
After their prefaces, all four of the gospel authors report that
Jesus’s story as an adult begins with his baptism in the Jordan
River. There, a wild man by the name of John the Baptist, dressed
in camel’s hair and leather, was dipping people in the river water.
Going down to the river: John the Baptist 
reveals the true Jesus
The gospel authors believe that John was preparing the way for
Jesus with his baptisms. So, when Jesus comes to the Jordan River
to be baptized, his baptism is presented as more than a symbolic
washing of sins. Instead, his baptism becomes the moment when
Jesus’s true nature is revealed to the gospel audience: Jesus is the
son of God (see Chapter 10 for more on John the Baptist).
Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
20

Beating Satan in the scorching sands
According to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, Jesus is driven out into the
wilderness after his baptism, where he’s tested by Satan for 40
days (this story isn’t in John’s gospel at all). Matthew and Luke
augment the story by narrating just what those temptations are
(see Chapter 10). This is the only place where Satan appears as a
character in the gospels.
In the gospels, Satan is doing just what his name means: A satan in
the original Hebrew is the slanderer or plotter who sues you and
hauls you into court. Today we might translate it “the adversary.”
He’s the one who stands up in front of the judge and accuses you or
puts you to the test. By the time the gospels were written, the term
had become a proper name for the personification of evil. And in
these stories, we see him doing his level best to take Jesus down.
The authors are using these stories to communicate what Jesus’s
mission is not about before the mission even starts. Jesus’s early
battles against hunger, the lure of earthly power, and the desire for
divine vindication demonstrate the things he successfully resisted
during his life (according to our authors). They certainly want to
make clear that Jesus isn’t in league with the Devil, a charge that’s
later leveled against him by his human adversaries (Mark 3:22–27).
Going public: The ministry begins
In Matthew, Mark, and Luke, when Jesus emerges from the wilder-
ness, he returns to his home region of the Galilee in the north, and
there he begins his public ministry. (You may find it odd to say
“the Galilee,” but believe it or not, that’s the proper name. It’s
called this in the New Testament because the word Galilee comes
from a Hebrew word for something circular, so it’s like saying “the
encircled area” or district.) Following in John the Baptist’s foot-
steps, he preaches that the “kingdom of God” is at hand and he
calls on people to repent. And like the Baptist, he begins gathering
followers and teaching them. In John’s gospel, Jesus’s ministry
begins in the Galilee right after the baptism with the call of the first
followers and the first of seven signs of power.
All the gospel authors are trying to set up Jesus’s ministry. They
want everyone to know that his ministry is powered by the Holy
Spirit that descended on him in baptism and that its power is
enough to defeat Satan himself.
Chapter 2: Comparing the Gospels: A Biblical Biography of Jesus 21

Drafting Disciples: Joining 
the Jesus Movement
As Jesus began to preach, teach, and heal, he also began to attract
a lot of attention. Some of these interested people decided to hang
around and become followers and students of Jesus as he traveled
from town to town. These people were called disciples. This term
means “students” or “followers” (from the Latin word “to learn”;
the Greek word in the gospels means the same thing).
Calling people up to active duty
All four of the gospels narrate that Jesus began to summon people
to follow him. Imagine it: Jesus, a complete stranger, walks up to a
person, tells him to drop everything (work, wife, kids) and follow
him, and the guy does! And I do mean “guy,” because only men got
these special “calls” (and only a few of them at that). None of the
women who followed Jesus got the same kind of clear invitation
(though we always have to remember that men wrote these stories).
It’s good to bear in mind the general point that the gospel authors
were telling stories here. They were painting the power of Jesus’s
call and the radical response of these followers in the starkest
terms. Did it really happen this way? And what effect does this
telling have on the reader? But remember that however these
people came to be Jesus’s followers, it’s clear that they would have
to leave their homes, families, and jobs to follow this man named
Jesus. Surprising as it may seem, many people did. Chapter 10
describes the most important followers, including “the Twelve”
men and women like Mary Magdalene.
Understanding the backgrounds 
of Jesus’s followers
Jesus’s early followers were residents of the region that he came
from: the Galilee, which is north of Judea.
 Simon Peter, Andrew, James, and John appear to be from the
fishing village of Capernaum; Levi (called Matthew in
Matthew’s gospel) collected taxes there as well.
 Mary Magdalene was so called because of the town she was
from: Magdala, which was just south of Capernaum along the
northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee.
Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
22

 Jesus’s mother, brothers, and sisters were from Nazareth, a bit
west of the Sea of Galilee.
In short, most of his first followers came from various Jewish vil-
lages in the Galilee, where his preaching and healing activity was
concentrated.
All the disciples’ names derive from Aramaic except for Philip and
Andrew, whose names come from Greek. Simon Peter has the most
names: Simon is Aramaic, “Peter” is Greek for “rock,” and he’s also
called “Cephas” which is Aramaic for “rock.” Most of the time, he’s
just called Peter in the gospels.
In terms of social class, it seems that several of these early follow-
ers were part of the vast working class of the region. In other
words, they weren’t destitute but they weren’t terribly well-off
either. Some of the followers, however, were from families with a
few more resources. James and John’s father, for example, hired
laborers to help him in his fishing business (Mark 1:20). Mary
Magdalene is never mentioned in conjunction with a husband, sug-
gesting that she may have had means of her own. Levi (or
Matthew) was a tax collector, and they were famous for lining their
pockets with added surcharges. Joanna, the wife of Herod’s stew-
ard (Luke 8:3), and Joseph of Arimathea provided for Jesus’s burial
(Mark 15:42–47), so they too may have been more well-off.
Luke gives the impression that all the women who followed Jesus
were fairly wealthy — he says they bankrolled Jesus’s entire mis-
sion — but this may have been Luke’s attempt to raise them above
suspicion, along with Jesus (Luke 8:1–3; see Chapter 10). After all,
some conservative folks may have wondered exactly why women
were wandering around the countryside with this guy. These folks
already had a pretty low view of the types of people that Jesus
hung around with.
It’s difficult to tell historically what class these people came from.
Why? Because the gospel authors were so concerned to present
Christianity in a certain light that they often made adjustments.
Teacher and Miracle Man: 
Jesus Spreads the Word
Jesus’s teachings and miracles seem to have been the things that
attracted both the casual and serious followers to him. The very
fact that many of his male followers were referred to as disciples
means that his role was that of a teacher. Others came hoping for
cures from illnesses and disabilities.
Chapter 2: Comparing the Gospels: A Biblical Biography of Jesus 23

But the rest of the crowd came for the show. Jesus performed
cures and exorcised demons, and a lot of people just wanted to see
these mysterious acts unfold right before their eyes. Like today’s
paparazzi waiting to catch a glimpse of Paris Hilton, plenty of the
curious onlookers mingled alongside the few fervent followers.
Teaching with authority
It’s difficult to know whether Jesus had any kind of formal education.
Luke is the only one to hint at literacy when he reports that Jesus
was able to read the Hebrew scriptures (Luke 4:16–22). But he could
speak well. He knew how to turn a phrase and tell a good story.
How Jesus taught
Even though Jesus was probably not well educated, he was clearly
a powerful teacher. His success came from his technique: He used
common examples drawn from daily life that people could under-
stand. He also used a lot of humor, though his riffs don’t translate
very well unless you’re a first-century Aramaic-speaking farmer! He
taught with authority, challenging people to change their lives and
standing his ground when they resisted.
Creating parables
Jesus’s favorite type of teaching was through stories, particularly
parables, which are story-riddles. (I say “favorite” not because I
know what Jesus liked, but because these parables are very
common in the earliest gospel material; flip to Chapter 11 for more
on Jesus’s many parables.) Stories have long been used by teach-
ers to make points or by prophets to highlight someone’s mistake.
They’re great teaching tools because sometimes you just can’t put
two and two together any other way. A parable starts off like it’s
about somebody else, and then it leads you to a conclusion that
you would have resisted if the story had been about you.
Using pithy sayings
Jesus liked short sayings that made quick points. For example, when
someone asked him whether he paid taxes to the hated Romans
with coins showing the emperor as God (blasphemy!), Jesus took
the coin and said, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what
is God’s” (Matthew 22:15–22). This type of line was clever, catchy,
and easy to remember. In fact, Jewish teachers often taught like this
because these witty sayings were so catchy but also made you stop
and think (for instance, in the previous coin example, you might ask
yourself, “Okay, but what is Caesar’s and what is God’s?”).
Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
24

The themes that Jesus taught
It’s quite likely that the gospels only represent some of the many
ideas that Jesus taught (see John 21:25, where the author says that
the “world couldn’t contain” all the books needed to cover every-
thing that Jesus did). But common to all four gospels are certain
teachings that come up over and over again. These themes are dis-
cussed in the following sections.
Love of God, neighbor, and enemy
The central idea that Jesus taught paralleled what the Jewish scrip-
tures before him taught, namely to love God with all your heart,
soul, and strength (Deuteronomy 6:5) and to love your neighbor as
yourself (Leviticus 19:18). When people approached Jesus and
asked him what the most important law was out of all 613 com-
mands in the Jewish scriptures, his answer was to love God, neigh-
bor, and enemy (Mark 12:28–34; Matthew 22:34–40; Luke 10:25–37).
Two renowned rabbis — Rabbi Hillel, who lived before Jesus, and
Rabbi Akiva, who (like Jesus) was executed by the Romans a cen-
tury later — had similar feelings to Jesus’s. They said that the entire
law was summarized by doing right by your neighbor. To this Jesus
added that your neighbor includes your enemy. Many people since
then have wished that Jesus hadn’t added that qualifier!
The way of the cross and the promise of the resurrection
Another central teaching of Jesus is that following him may lead to
persecution and execution, as it would for him (Mark 13:9–13;
8:31–38). Several gospel authors refer to this as the “way of 
the cross.”
In the gospel stories, Jesus also teaches that his death wouldn’t be
the end of him (Mark 8:31–33). He teaches that he, and they, would
be resurrected (John 11:17–27). He says that they were called to be
faithful to God and that God too would be faithful to them with his
promise of resurrection.
The kingdom of God
Jesus teaches that God has power, and he refers to God’s power as
the “kingdom of God” or “kingdom of heaven.” In the gospel por-
traits, Jesus constantly contrasts the power of God with the power
of Rome and other earthly powers. He says that Rome offers one
kind of peace but that God offers another. Rome exploits, but God
provides. Under Rome, Jesus says, the powerful are in control;
under God, the lowly are raised and the powerful are brought low
(Luke 1:46–55). Jesus and his disciples are supposed to be unlike
the rulers of this world (Matthew 4:8–10; Mark 10:42–44).
Chapter 2: Comparing the Gospels: A Biblical Biography of Jesus 25

A liberal and a conservative
The gospels were keen to present the fact that Jesus’s teachings
were about Jewish law. In the gospel stories, Jesus makes clear
that mercy to others is more important than rituals in the Temple.
This teaching echoes the Jewish prophets. In fact, according to the
gospel authors, Jesus quotes the prophets directly in this teaching
and then tells his audience to go and learn what the prophet meant
(Matthew 9:13; 12:7; Hosea 6:6).
Jesus took a pretty liberal position on some laws — so much so that
righteous fellows complained about him hanging out with the wrong
crowd. For example, the liberal Jesus let his disciples work on the
Sabbath (no one was supposed to work on the Sabbath according
to the Ten Commandments [Exodus 20:8–11]), and he himself healed
people on that day (Mark 2:23–28; 3:1–6; healing wasn’t necessarily a
violation of the Sabbath, as you discover in Chapter 12).
At the same time, however, Jesus could be much more conservative
than other Jewish teachers. For example, Mark notes that Jesus
absolutely prohibits divorce — no exceptions (Mark 10:1–12; 
exceptions were added by later authors as in Matthew 5:31–32). This
belief was even more stringent than earlier biblical revelation
(Deuteronomy 24:1–4). The same was true for murder and adultery.
In fact, Jesus taught that anger was just as bad as murder, and that
a lustful look was the same as committing adultery (Matthew 5:21–30).
Talk about some tough rules — if you take them literally!
Acting with power
The gospel authors pepper their stories with manifestations of Jesus’s
power. Whether Jesus was controlling nature or healing human
disability, the gospel stories make it clear that Jesus’s power comes
from and manifests God, as I explain in the following sections.
You might come to the story of Jesus’s miracles with the impres-
sion that Jesus is God, so these miraculous powers aren’t coming
from God, but from his own nature as God. The teaching that Jesus
is divine has roots in the gospels and has been developing for
2,000 years (flip to Chapter 15 for the earliest debates). But histori-
cal Jesus scholars have questioned whether anyone would have
believed this during Jesus’s life (before the resurrection). In fact,
the gospels report that few characters in the story seem to share
the gospel authors’ point of view about Jesus even with the mira-
cles. Some of them even wonder if his miraculous powers come
from a demonic source. All of this raises the possibility that things
looked different to the historical Jesus’s audience than they do to
people today.
Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
26

Examining Jesus’s power over nature and healing
Early on, Jesus had a reputation for his power over nature and for
his ability to heal people. Most of the nature miracles, like calming
a storm or walking on water (Mark 4:35–41; 6:47–52), were seen only
by his followers, with the important exception of the multiplication
of a few bread loaves to feed thousands (Mark 6:32–44; 8:1–9; John
6:1–13). In contrast, many other people saw him heal the paralyzed,
the blind, lepers, and the “demon-possessed.” As a result, crowds
besieged Jesus wherever he went.
The ultimate nature and healing miracle — the one that transformed
frightened followers to public preachers — was his own resurrection
(see Chapter 15). This miracle is never presented as something
Jesus accomplishes himself, however. Instead, this miracle is seen
as God’s vindication of Jesus.
Understanding what folks thought about Jesus’s miracles
The fact that Jesus performed miracles drew crowds and skeptics
(and it still does today). After all, in a world that believed in demons,
it wasn’t always clear what powers were behind acts like these.
People were genuinely uncertain, even terrified, of the power that
could heal the blind and raise the dead. Diseases, genetic defects,
deformities, and death weren’t understood biologically as they are
today. They were often seen as manifestations of evil, and sometimes
the victims or their parents were thought to be responsible for the
misfortunes.
So, given all the hype, people obviously had questions. For instance,
people wondered where Jesus’s power was coming from. If someone
like Jesus could control these evil manifestations, was he in league
with the Devil? Or perhaps was he master of evil and thus aligned
with God (Mark 3:20–30)? The gospel authors definitely didn’t want
anyone to think that Satan was working through Jesus! That led
them to make it clear that Jesus was able to perform these great
feats because God was working through him.
Jesus’s miracles were enough to convince many of his contempo-
raries that the messianic age had dawned — the restoration of
health, wholeness, and justice that had long been hoped for by
several Jewish groups. But other people weren’t convinced. After
all, many expected that all the blind would see, all the lame would
walk, all the captives would be freed, and the forces of evil would
be decisively destroyed. Jesus’s miracles, however, healed only a
few blind men and a few paralyzed people, and freed absolutely no
slaves. For those who believed Jesus was the messiah, it was
enough that he had inaugurated the age; they could wait for the
job to be finished. But for many others, the messianic age hadn’t
begun yet, so Jesus couldn’t be its messiah.
Chapter 2: Comparing the Gospels: A Biblical Biography of Jesus 27

Meeting resistance wherever he went
Jesus preached to the Jews in the Galilee and later traveled to
Jerusalem, continuing to preach and heal along the way. As he
made his way, he drew many Jewish followers. According to the
gospels, however, he was dogged along the way by others who
didn’t buy in to his beliefs and teachings.
The gospel authors name a few groups that had it in for Jesus,
including the scribes, the Pharisees, and the leaders of Jerusalem.
It’s just as true that the gospel authors had it out for these groups.
To understand the animosity, you first need the following back-
ground information on these groups:
 The scribes and Pharisees: These two groups were Jesus’s most
common opponents in the gospel accounts of Jesus’s ministry,
especially while he was in the Galilee. The Pharisees weren’t
religious ministers; they were simply lay people who dedicated
themselves to a more rigorous observance of Jewish law (see
Chapter 7 for more on Jewish law and society). They seemed
to care about the same things that Jesus cared about, namely
how to make Jewish law relevant to daily life (for example,
what to do on the Sabbath, how to prepare for meals, and who
people should hang out with). The scribes you meet in the
gospels are among the small minority of literate folks. They
could read and copy manuscripts of religious texts and were
regarded as authorities on the Jewish law. According to the
gospels, both the scribes and the Pharisees start testing and
trapping Jesus early in his public work.
 The leaders in Jerusalem: Because the central religious shrine,
the Temple, was in Jerusalem, many leaders — priests, the high
priest, and the court of the elite priests and aristocracy — all
lived near the city. On occasion, the Roman prefect also would
visit from Caesarea Maritima to maintain the peace and
administer Roman justice (see Chapters 8 and 13).
According to the gospels, the issues that the scribes, Pharisees,
and eventually the Jewish high priest had with Jesus were about
the authority that Jesus presumed over the law and the linked
issue of Jesus’s true identity (see Chapter 13 for more on these
debates). The gospels present these as hot topics from practically
the first day of Jesus’s ministry (Mark 3:6), and the heat just keeps
firing up from there until the scene of Jesus’s formal trial during his
final trip to Jerusalem. But it seems more likely that these debates
were not so heated during Jesus’s life as they became after, and
that the real opposition to Jesus was tied more clearly to his exe-
cution as “King of the Jews.”
Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
28

Journeying to Jerusalem: The
Crucifixion and Resurrection
According to the gospels, Jesus makes his infamous final trip to
Jerusalem because that’s where he wants to celebrate the Jewish
holiday of Passover. (To find out why Jews celebrated this holiday,
see the nearby sidebar, “Celebrating the Exodus with the Passover
festival.”) In John’s gospel, this trip represents Jesus’s third trip to
Jerusalem for Passover. In the other three gospels, Jesus only
makes one trip to Jerusalem as an adult.
The gospels offer another reason that Jesus decides to go to
Jerusalem: He knows he must go because the Jewish capital is
where many of the great prophets of the past challenged the
Jewish kings. According to the gospel authors, Jesus believes that
Jerusalem was the place where God’s messengers were killed
(Matthew 23:37–39). And because he predicts that his fate will be
the same, Jesus too knows he must go.
The gospels note that Jesus predicts that the opponents who will
kill him are the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes (Mark
8:31). This isn’t so difficult to imagine because Jesus stirs up oppo-
sition almost as soon as he starts preaching. The following sec-
tions chronicle Jesus’s Passover trip, crucifixion, and resurrection
according to the gospels.
The Last Supper
Because his days were numbered and Passover was at hand, Jesus
had one final meal with his disciples. In the gospels of Mark,
Matthew, and Luke, that meal is on the first night of the weeklong
Passover feast.
At the meal, Jesus blesses the unleavened bread in an unusual way,
calling it his body and breaking it for his disciples to share. He
blesses the cup of wine in an equally unsettling way; he calls it his
blood — the blood of a new covenant that would be shed for many
people. He then asks his disciples to remember him by sharing the
meal (Luke 22:14–23). Finally, he predicts that one of them will
soon betray him (Mark 14:18–21; Matthew 26:21–25).
In John’s gospel, Jesus has a final meal with his disciples, but it
isn’t the Passover meal (Passover was set to begin the next day). In
John’s gospel, the central symbol isn’t the food and drink at the
meal but Jesus’s act of washing his disciples’ feet (John 13:2–17).
This gesture is Jesus’s last teaching; he humbly served his stu-
dents, so they should therefore humbly serve others.

The agony and arrest in the garden
After the Last Supper, Jesus goes out to a garden called
Gethsemane, which was east of the city and overlooking the
Temple. All but one of his disciples accompany him to the garden,
where they promptly fall asleep (perhaps they had too much wine
at the Last Supper?). Jesus, alone in prayer, asks to avoid the fate
that awaits him, but in the end he resigns himself to what he
believes is God’s will. (John’s gospel, which emphasizes Jesus’s
foreknowledge and control over these arresting events, doesn’t
show Jesus praying to avoid his fate; see John 18:1–4). He returns
twice to the disciples, and both times he finds them asleep (Mark
14:32–42). And then a crowd, which is sent by the Jewish leaders
and led by Jesus’s own disciple, Judas, comes to arrest Jesus as if

Celebrating the Exodus 
with the Passover festival
In Jesus’s time, the Passover festival was an annual holiday to celebrate the Hebrew
exodus (escape) from Egypt. As the story goes in the book of Exodus, the Hebrew
people had originally been free in Egypt, but a new Pharaoh came along and
enslaved them. This new Pharaoh even tried to kill all the male children when the
population grew too big (Exodus 1).
One male child named Moses survived, and when he became an adult, God called
to him from a burning bush. God told Moses to lead the Hebrews out of Egypt
(Exodus 2–4). Moses warned the Pharaoh to let him take the people away. He used
nine plagues (bloody river water, swarms of frogs, clouds of gnats and flies, live-
stock illnesses, boils, hail, locusts, and darkness) to try and persuade the Pharaoh
(Exodus 5–10). But when the Pharaoh didn’t budge, the final plague struck: God
slaughtered the firstborn sons of the Egyptians. God passed over (hence the name
of the holiday) the Hebrew homes that had been marked ahead of time with the
blood of a lamb. With the Egyptian homes in chaos, the Hebrews ate a hurried meal
of unleavened bread (they didn’t have time to wait for it to rise!) and raced out of the
country (Exodus 11–15).
Jews marked this event by an annual, weeklong festival. On the first night, they
roasted a lamb that had been slaughtered in the Temple and ate certain foods like
unleavened bread and bitter herbs meant to recall that hurried last supper in Egypt
(Exodus 12). They blessed and drank several cups of wine and recalled the story of
Passover and their gratitude for God’s act. The remaining days were considered
work holidays, and they avoided leavened bread.
When there was actually a Temple in Jerusalem, as there was in the time of Jesus,
Jews traveled there for the holiday so that they could slaughter a lamb properly in
the Temple.

he were a bandit or rebel leader. Jesus’s disciples barely mount a
defense; instead, they scatter quickly and abandon him (Mark
14:43–52).
Jesus on trial
After being arrested, Jesus is put on trial. The gospels narrate a
series of trials, though the order and number of precise scenes
varies. For now, I’ll just explain the basic story.
First Jesus is taken before the Sanhedrin, which is the council of
chief priests, elders, and scribes. (The Sanhedrin was led by the
high priest.) False witnesses are brought in, and, in the end, Jesus is
accused of blaspheming God’s name by claiming to be the “Son of
Man, seated at the right hand of power” (a quote from Daniel 7:13;
see Mark 14:62). In the gospel authors’ view, Jesus is that prophesied
judge. The council then condemns Jesus to death, but because it
lacks the power to execute, it sends him off to the Roman prefect,
Pontius Pilate, who’s in town for the Passover festival.
At this point, Pilate is uncertain as to what he should do. According
to the gospels, Pilate believes that Jesus is innocent, and that the
Jewish leaders are just jealous of his popularity (Matthew 27:18).
But he has an angry Jewish crowd on his hands, and with so many
people in town for the festival, Pilate doesn’t want to provoke them
into a revolt. So, he questions Jesus, and then offers to release either
Jesus or the imprisoned rebel Barabbas, assuming that the crowd
will choose Jesus. In Luke’s gospel, Pilate even sends Jesus to Herod
Antipas (who’s also in town for the festivities), hoping that he, the
Galilean ruler, will take care of this Galilean problem (Luke 23:6–12).
No such luck.
So Pilate has Jesus flogged, thinking that will satisfy the crowd. But
when he presents the flogged Jesus to the people, they cry out,
“Crucify him!” Pilate, who has become fearful of the crowd, finally
agrees to crucify Jesus. Pilate then washes his own hands to demon-
strate his innocence in the matter (Matthew 27:22–25). He wants no
part in this execution because he views Jesus as innocent. This is one
way that the gospels lay the blame for Jesus’s death on the Jewish
leaders. According to the biblical storyline, the leaders wanted Jesus
dead because of who he said he was (Mark 14:61–64; Matthew 26:
63–66, Luke 22:67–71; John 19:7).
Chapter 2: Comparing the Gospels: A Biblical Biography of Jesus 31

Jesus’s execution and burial
After Pilate decides that Jesus is to be crucified, Jesus is taken out-
side of the city walls to the place of execution. The executions in
those days took place at one of the main roads into the city.
Crucifixion was a painful and prolonged form of state-sanctioned
execution that was reserved for thieves and rebels. It was a public
and humiliating way to die, and it was used as a kind of propa-
ganda weapon by Rome. You can read all about the gory details in
Chapters 13 and 14, but you can’t read about them in the gospels
because the gospel authors treat the event very briefly. According
to the gospels, Jesus was crucified with the charge “King of the
Jews” over his head. Jesus wasn’t on the cross for very long. His
death took only three hours. Some Jewish leaders approached
Pilate and requested special permission to take his body down and
bury it, and Pilate agreed. Because it was the eve of Sabbath
(meaning that work had to stop) Jesus was placed in the tomb
quickly and without the usual preparation of the body.
On the third day: Jesus’s resurrection
After the Sabbath ends, Mary Magdalene and perhaps a few others
among Jesus’s female followers go to the tomb to anoint the body
with spices and rewrap it properly in linens. When they arrive at
the tomb, they find the stone rolled away from the entrance. With
the help of some angelic revelations, they understand that Jesus
has been raised from the dead. The women report Jesus’s resurrec-
tion to the other disciples, and soon others begin reporting
encounters with the risen Jesus. The reports vary a good bit from
each other (you can read all about them in Chapter 15).
Jesus’s resurrection marks the turning point between the life of Jesus
the man and the life of the risen Christ. The only way you or I can
get back to the historical man is through the reports of witnesses
who believed that he was much more than just a historical man.
Their faith is what helped make Christianity a major world religion.
It also complicates and enlivens the quest for the historical man.

Pursuing the Historical 
Jesus in the Gospels
In This Chapter
 Aiming for the goal of finding the historical Jesus
 Navigating obstacles by following the rules of the road
 Discovering how to get through bias to biography
T
he life of Jesus presented in the gospels isn’t identical to 
the life of the historical Jesus. For starters, the gospel authors
themselves differed on certain details, and it’s sometimes difficult to
know whom to believe. Then there’s that lag between Jesus’s life and
the time the gospels were written. And to top it all off is the admit-
ted bias of the authors. Beliefs aren’t history, so if you want to know
more about the historical Jesus, you have to sift through these later
and conflicting beliefs about who he is.
In this chapter, you find out why people care about unearthing 
the historical Jesus, you navigate the obstacles to finding him in the
gospels, and you discover the techniques for reconstructing his life.
Setting Your Sights on 
the Historical Jesus
There’s a good reason why detective shows are so popular: People
love a good mystery because they want a crack at figuring it out
themselves. They enjoy the satisfaction of getting to the truth.
That same impulse lies at the heart of the quest for the historical
Jesus, especially in this scientific age. If you accept that Jesus 
actually lived, you probably figure that there ought to be some
facts about his life that everybody can agree on.

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
34
For most of the past 2,000 years, however, people haven’t agreed
about Jesus at all. In fact, the differences between people’s beliefs
about Jesus contributed to long-lived, bloody conflicts.
So, when the Enlightenment offered a scientific process for discover-
ing truths in the 17th and 18th centuries, some people wondered
Challenging the goals of the historical
Jesus quest
Postmodern thinkers have been wondering for several decades about the possibility
of discovering “objective truth.” For example, if you try to claim that Jesus absolutely
did something, someone today is going to question how you can be so sure, whether
there are facts out there that can be recovered, whose interests your portrait is 
serving, how your Jesus reflects your own psychology and autobiography rather than
that of the Palestinian Jew, and who got to decide on what counts as “facts” in the
first place. They’ll want to pose these same questions to the gospels: what social 
conflicts are being worked out in the stories, whose interests the gospels serve, and
who got to decide what gospels counted as scripture. We are much more sensitive
today than the Enlightenment thinkers were about how power, culture, and 
psychological factors play a role in our constructions of history.
Another criticism is whether this kind of inquiry is even worthwhile. This concern 
has been raised by many Christians and most recently by Pope Benedict XVI in his
bestselling book, Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the
Transfiguration (2007). For the Pope, the historical Jesus quest obscures the object
of Christian faith (the Christ of the gospels) by going behind the gospels to earlier
sources and by spawning conflicting portraits of the man from Nazareth. He finds 
historical spadework necessary but inadequate for the following reasons:
 Historical reconstruction is ever changing and hypothetical, so it provides no
point of rest or certainty.
 Historical methods focus on the past, not on the present context of faith.
 Historical studies treat the Biblical texts as separate human documents 
produced in various social and cultural contexts rather than as the unified Word
of God interpreted in the context of the living tradition of the Church.
Who is the real, “historical” Jesus for Pope Benedict XVI? It’s the Jesus of the gospels.
According to the Pope, the dramatic claims of the New Testament — that Jesus is
divine and knew it, and that he had an intimate relationship with his Father — are best
explained not as the result of post-Easter reflection but as the most plausible account
for why Jesus was crucified and why he ultimately made such a splash. As the Pope
admits, his book isn’t a historical inquiry into Jesus of Nazareth but a faith conviction
exploring an imagined life of Christ. But then, that’s what all reconstructions of Jesus
are, if the postmodern scholars are correct!

whether it could also help settle some questions about Jesus. For
instance, if you could simply figure out who he really was and what
he really said by using objective rules that everyone could agree on,
you could examine these messy religious conflicts and find some
common ground. (See Chapter 4 for more about the Enlightenment’s
impact on the perception of Jesus.)
The basic rules for this rational process require that you work with
actual evidence and you read that evidence like a historian, meaning
that you try to clear your mind of prior beliefs and study the actual
evidence as objectively as possible.
Sounds easy enough, but it’s actually quite difficult to do. Some 
of the obstacles lie in the evidence. We don’t have a lot, what we
do have often conflicts, and because the gospel authors weren’t
Enlightenment thinkers, they felt perfectly comfortable combining
their later beliefs with the earlier source material. But another
important obstacle to this rational inquiry is the inquiry itself —
whether it can be “objective” at all, whether it can really arrive at
“facts” untainted by beliefs, and whether this is even a worthwhile
goal (see the nearby sidebar “Challenging the goals of the historical
Jesus quest”).
Navigating the Roadblocks
The four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were written 
by believers. None of these authors, except maybe Luke, were histo-
rians, and even Luke had a different notion of history than you or 
I do. For example, I think of history as facts that can be established
without a doubt. Luke, on the other hand, wasn’t trying to be 
objective so much as persuasive.
So, if the gospels are written to persuade you of a viewpoint, how
are you supposed to find what we might call facts? Just like gospel
historians, you have to navigate the roadblocks and sift history out
of the gospel texts by using the rules of historicity, all of which I out-
line in the following sections. It isn’t an easy process, but with my
all-purpose guide to the roadblocks and with some rules for getting
around them, you’ll be discovering some facts in no time.
Roadblock #1: The witnesses 
don’t agree
The four witnesses (gospel authors) don’t always agree with one
another. And some of their differences are pretty significant. For
Chapter 3: Pursuing the Historical Jesus in the Gospels 35

example, the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke all say that Jesus
overturned the money-changers’ tables in the Temple just before
his death, and they hint that this act was why he was arrested
(Matthew 21:12–13; Mark 11:15–17; Luke 19:45–46). However, John’s
author notes that the Temple tantrum was Jesus’s first public act,
and that the catalyst for his arrest three years later is his raising of
Lazarus (John 2:14–22; 11:1–53).
When facing these discrepancies, how do you determine which one
is giving the historical facts? If you’re on a jury and the witnesses
don’t agree on something, you have to try to figure out who’s telling
the truth, right? Well, the same goes for the quest of the historical
Jesus. Here are a few rules to get you started:
 Eyewitness testimony is better than hearsay. This rule 
makes the gospels tough to work with. We can presume that
the authors used eyewitness testimony, but it’s unlikely that
they themselves were eyewitnesses (Luke admits this in Luke
1:2). The names attached to the gospels aren’t on the earliest
manuscripts.
 If the account is embarrassing, it’s most likely true. This
important rule corresponds to that question of motive. After
all, if somebody admits something in court even though it’s
embarrassing, it’s more believable, isn’t it? That person had
every reason not to tell it, but he still did. In the case of Jesus,
the gospels report the awkward and therefore historically likely
fact that he was betrayed by one of his followers and crucified.
 The portrait of Jesus must be consistent with the way 
Jesus died. If your portrait of Jesus paints him as an innocent
flower child healing people on a hillside and acting like an all-
around good guy, it will be tough to square that with the most
indisputable fact about him: that he was crucified by Rome.
 Someone has to report the episode or saying. I know this
sounds obvious, but you really do need at least one witness to
report the facts. Otherwise you’re making what historians call
“an argument from silence,” which is the weakest kind of argu-
ment. The most famous recent example is the claim that Jesus
and Mary Magdalene were married, for which there’s not a
shred of evidence (see Chapters 5 and 10).
Roadblock #2: The witnesses 
agree too much
Another problem with the gospels is one that’s exactly the opposite
of the previous problem: Sometimes the witnesses agree too much.
Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
36

So much of Jesus’s story is shared in the gospels of Matthew, Mark,
and Luke that you may start to wonder who copied whom.
These three gospels are so similar that they’re often called the 
synoptic gospels, from a Greek term meaning that they “see the story
together.” Often the words are practically, if not entirely, identical
(see the later section, “Building your case with a couple of tools,” 
for more details). With apologies to the evangelists, think of it this
way: If you were a teacher and three of your students turned these
gospels in for credit, you’d suspect plagiarism.
In a modern-day trial, if two or three witnesses took the stand and
gave testimony that was identical word-for-word, the judge would
suspect that they had tampered with each other’s testimony or that
they had met outside the courtroom to “get their stories straight.”
For the synoptic gospel writers, it was the same. One of the
authors wrote first, and the other two relied on the first guy because
they wanted to get the story right. What’s more, Matthew and Luke
appear to have borrowed heavily from some published list of Jesus’s
teachings that preachers were carrying around at the time. (Check
out the later section, “Trekking to another source in special cases:
The mysterious Q,” for more on this mysterious list.)
You don’t have to assume that these authors were tampering 
with evidence or even that they were lazy. But if you’re a historian
today, you also can’t really read these three gospels as independ-
ent witnesses. Instead, you have to figure out what the root sources
of these gospels are in order to determine your independent 
witnesses. This situation creates three more rules of historicity 
(see the preceding section for the first four rules):
 Early sources are more credible than late ones. Written
accounts of Jesus from the first century CE will be much more
important than the many gospels of the second century, such
as the Gospel of Mary Magdalene or the Gospel of Judas (flip 
to Chapter 5 for more on these later gospels).
 Traditions need to be attested in multiple, independent 
witnesses. If an author copied a story from an earlier source,
his copy can’t count as an “independent witness” because 
it “depends” on the source. That insight means you have to
line up your independent sources first, and then see what
they agree on (these independent sources are all laid out 
in Chapter 5).
 Accounts need to be coherent with other historical details.
Suppose that you’ve discovered a saying of Jesus’s that’s found
in several independent witnesses. And say you also have a very
Chapter 3: Pursuing the Historical Jesus in the Gospels 37

similar saying that’s only in one source. The first saying is likely
to be historical because it’s attested in multiple, independent
witnesses. The second saying is also likely to be historical
because it’s similar to the attested passage. It’s like the 
second saying gets a free ride.
Roadblock #3: Time has passed
Even if you can figure out which source was written the earliest,
you can’t assume it delivers the historical Jesus. Even the earliest
gospel was written 35–40 years after Jesus died. And during that
time, some authenticity was surely lost because of translation into
other languages, changing circumstances, and the haphazard way
that information was preserved. Anyone can create stories, and as
stories are passed on, they’re changed slightly (remember the tele-
phone game when you were a kid?). Many of the changes were the
result of ongoing reflection on the significance of Jesus in light of
the Jewish scriptures.
After years had passed, you can imagine what happened when
someone sat down to write a gospel of Jesus’s life. Some of Jesus’s
own teachings and practices were obviously available to this author,
but they were filtered through the various Christian communities
who had preserved and interpreted them. These communities also
translated the teachings from Aramaic into Greek, which again 
disrupts some of the authenticity. The gospel could never win the
Oscar for best documentary feature, but do remember that it wasn’t
really trying to. Instead, this account of Jesus’s life was a faith 
statement.
So how do you ferret out the facts after time has passed? Here’s 
a rule of historicity: Based on the way traditions develop, a teach-
ing or event is more likely to be historical if it’s discontinuous with
known traditions. The rule is that if Jesus supposedly said or did
something completely different from Jewish tradition or early
Christian teaching and practice, it may have actually happened. 
A gospel author wouldn’t likely make up such strange accounts;
too many people would challenge them.
This rule isn’t about gospel traditions that match historically likely
events in Jesus’s life. Instead, it’s meant to rule out gospel traditions
that sound too much like much later Church teaching or earlier
Jewish tradition. For example, the teaching about Jesus’s divinity is
highly developed by the end of the first century, so when it pops up
in a story about Jesus’s life, historical Jesus scholars get suspicious.
It’s not discontinuous enough with early Church teaching, so it gets
ruled out. This principle of discontinuity also rules in any traditions
Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
38

that seem different from past Jewish and future Christian teaching. 
A good example is the tradition that Jesus forbade fasting (Mark
2:18–20), which would put Jesus out of sync with both Judaism and
later Christianity. That makes the tradition look authentic.
The problem with this argument is that it makes Jesus look really
strange. After all, if this rule were the only one that you had, you’d
end up imagining a historical Jesus who was so unusual that nobody
would have understood him! Plus, there really isn’t enough evidence
from that time to have a full picture of what Jewish or Christian soci-
eties were like. So how can you know what was usual or unusual? As
a result, not everyone’s convinced that this rule is a very useful one.
Roadblock #4: The writers 
were biased
Historians expect bias in their evidence. So when they read evidence
they apply another rule: They try to anticipate the bias and presume
that the facts have been changed.
Each of the gospels begins with the confession of Jesus as some-
thing more than just a historical figure, as the messiah or “anointed
one” (Matthew 1:1), the Son of God (Mark 1:1), the son of the Most
High (Luke 1:32), and the very Word of God (John 1:1–5, 14).
The authors plant their faith flags right in the first chapter of the
gospel, so you can anticipate that they’ll be claiming the whole
story for that portrait of Jesus. And that’s their right — they are
the authors, after all. But there’s a more problematic example of
this bias, and this one comes with a terrible legacy. I’m speaking
about how the Jewish people are portrayed in the gospels.
By the time the gospels were written, animosities between 
the Christians and Jews had become heated and exacerbated by
the war with Rome and its aftermath (in which Rome destroyed
Jerusalem and demolished its Temple in 70 CE). I explain this more
thoroughly in Chapters 13 and 14, but the upshot was that the
Christians blamed the Jews more and Rome less for Jesus’s death
as the first century wound down. They also targeted the newly
emerging power brokers, the Pharisees, as the persistent enemies
of Jesus. This isn’t historical, but because these are the texts that
Christians have been reading ever since, Christians have treated it
as history, and that has led to untold horrors for the Jewish people.
Chapter 3: Pursuing the Historical Jesus in the Gospels 39

Roadblock #5: Modern 
folks are biased, too
Some roadblocks that you have to watch out for are modern 
rather than ancient. They have to do with you and me. Just like 
the gospel authors, modern authors and interpreters have biases,
too. For example, I didn’t live at the time of Jesus, and you may
suspect that my version of the story is even less accurate than 
the gospels because it’s a full 2,000 years after Jesus’s life. That’s 
a good suspicion to have, because even though I try to be objective
and careful with the evidence, the story has so many gaps that 
I might unknowingly over-interpret it and give you a false picture.
The truth is that everybody reads things into stories. The narrative
tells you only so much, and your imagination supplies the rest. In
fact, stories actively invite you to enter, to imagine yourself in the
situation, and to wonder how you would have reacted. And you
accept that invitation, often without even realizing how much from
your own experience you’re reading into the story. You may, for
instance, imagine the settings, compare the characters to yourself 
or to people that you know, supply the characters’ motives, assume
that they share your values, and take their words (which are trans-
lated from Greek) at face value.
There’s no rule that comes out of this roadblock, only a suggestion.
Try to assume that the Bible’s characters are very different from
you (and those you know) and that their families, laws, customs,
social class, and values are different from yours as well.
Playing Detective: Imagining
What Really Happened
The gospels don’t offer transparent evidence for the historical Jesus.
However, you don’t have to throw the holy baby out with the bath-
water, either. A gospel is like any piece of evidence — you have 
to study and decipher it. You can find historical evidence in these
writings as long as you know the tricks of the detective’s trade.
The most important thing you need to determine when you’re 
sifting historical facts from the gospels is which of the sources 
is the earliest. If manuscripts include dates, this determination is
easy. But, of course, none of the gospel authors dated their stories.
In fact, no original gospel manuscripts actually exist, only later
copies. You need some criteria for judging which stories and 
Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
40

sayings are the earliest, because those at least will get you closer 
to the historical Jesus. Remember: The earlier a tradition, the less
likely it’s shaped or generated by later historical circumstances. 
It still may not trace to the historical Jesus, though; we need addi-
tional clues to figure that out. In the following sections, I outline 
the steps for determining the earliest sources.
Following the clues
If you have several sources and you want to find out which one 
is the earliest, the first step is to search for clues in, outside, and
between the texts:
 Clues in the text: When examining the text in a gospel, you 
may notice that it refers to a historical event, which means 
that it had to have been written after that event happened. For
instance, because all four of the Bible’s gospels refer vividly to
the siege and destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE,
it’s safe to speculate that they were written after that event.
 Clues outside the text: To figure out the latest possible date 
for a gospel — when it must have been written by — you can
look at other sources. What you’re looking for are instances
where other authors have quoted text from your gospel source.
For example, there are a couple of texts and authors who lived
in the early 100s CE who quote passages from Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John. So, we can safely assume that these four
gospels were written by that time.
 Clues between the texts: The fact that there are four gospels
provides another technique for figuring out which one came
first. This technique is called relative dating. And no, this isn’t
about going out for drinks with your cousin. Relative dating
involves looking at the stories that are shared across the four
gospels to see how they differ. This technique is pretty handy.
For instance, consider this: If two or three stories explain some-
thing that isn’t clear in one, you can safely assume that those
two or three texts were most likely written later. Or, if one of the
gospels develops something in the tradition at much greater
length, it’s possible that this gospel author had more time 
to think things through.
You can’t determine which of the gospels is earliest just yet — 
you need a few more tools, which I provide in the next section.
Chapter 3: Pursuing the Historical Jesus in the Gospels 41

Building your case with 
a couple of tools
To study the clues between the gospels, the most helpful tool 
for figuring out the earliest traditions in the gospels is a synopsis, 
a book that lays out parallel versions of the same story. People have
actually compiled and published them, and they’re even available
online (for example, see John W. Marshall’s page “The Five Gospels
Parallels,” which includes Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Thomas
in English at www.utoronto.ca/religion/synopsis). As an exam-
ple, I’ve laid out the synopsis of the baptism of Jesus in Table 3-1.
The synoptic layout makes the similarities and differences between
the versions quite obvious.

In Table 3-1, you can see the following differences among the
gospels:
 Matthew’s gospel shows the conversation between Jesus 
and John the Baptist in which John says how improper it 
is for him to baptize the greater person.
 In Mark’s gospel, there was no such conversation; John 
simply baptizes Jesus.
 Luke’s gospel doesn’t include the conversation between 
John and Jesus either. In fact, just before this episode, Luke
narrates that John has already been arrested, so it isn’t clear
that the lesser guy baptized Jesus at all (or even met him).
 John’s gospel shows a similar move: The Baptist doesn’t 
baptize Jesus; he simply testifies that Jesus is greater than he.
You can also always use a second tool to supplement a synopsis.
That tool is called a biblical commentary. A biblical commentary is 
a book that gives you background on a biblical book and then walks
you line-by-line through the text. The author explains things and
helps you notice and interpret these intriguing differences between
the gospels. Publishing houses often run a whole series, with differ-
ent authors handling different books depending on their expertise
(like the Hermeneia commentaries from Augsburg Fortress, the
Anchor Bible commentaries from Doubleday, or the Interpretation
Bible Commentary series from Westminster John Knox).
Putting it all together
Earlier in this chapter, you find out the rules and tools that histori-
ans use to analyze the gospels. You discover how to pick up on bias,
how to trace developing traditions across texts, and how to test the
reliability of an event against the number of independent witnesses.
Chapter 3: Pursuing the Historical Jesus in the Gospels 43

Now it’s time to put all those ideas to use. Take another look at the
baptism synopsis in Table 3-1 and try your hand at answering these
two questions:
 Did this event really happen — did John baptize Jesus?
 Which gospel was most likely written first?
If you’re still unsure, don’t worry; I help you come to some 
conclusions in the next couple of sections.
Deciding whether an event happened
If you reason that the baptism of Jesus really happened, you 
have a lot of scholarly company. The most striking facts in support
of John’s baptism of Jesus include the following (based on rules of
historicity that I discuss in the earlier section, “Roadblock #1: The 
witnesses don’t agree”):
 The event is embarrassing, and yet the gospels report 
it. If you’re a Christian, this scene may be so familiar to you 
that it doesn’t seem embarrassing at all. But take your cue
from Matthew, Luke, and John: All of them are a little sensitive
regarding Jesus’s superiority to John. Each of them finds a way
to make John less central to the scene. Matthew has John say
he’s less important. Luke removes him from the scene entirely
(he’s already been imprisoned). John’s gospel never narrates a
baptism; the Baptist sees Jesus and testifies that he’s superior.
 All four gospels report the event. To be fair, however, 
note that Matthew and Luke use Mark’s gospel, so they aren’t
exactly independent witnesses to the tradition. But Mark and
John are, so you can safely rely on the fact that you have two
independent witnesses to some sort of encounter between
Jesus and John the Baptist.
Determining which source came first
So now you probably want to know which gospel was most likely
written first. Here, Mark’s gospel wins. The major reason for his
victory is, once again, the rule of embarrassment. Mark creates 
a problem by saying that John baptized Jesus (which makes John
look more important). Mark also neglects to explain why Jesus
needs to be baptized. After all, if John’s washing is “a baptism of
repentance for the forgiveness of sins” (Mark 1:4), why does Jesus
need it? Each of the other three gospels fixes these problems,
either by a conversation between Jesus and John (Matthew 3:15),
John’s testimony (John 1:30; 3:28–30), or removing John entirely
from the scene (Luke 3:19–22).
Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
44

It’s easier to believe that the three other gospel authors improved
on Mark’s problematic story than it is to believe that Mark took one
of the other well-explained versions and cut out the clarifying stuff.
Try this process out on as many other gospel passages as you 
like. Over and over, you’ll find that Mark is problematic, rough, and
awkward, and that the parallel passages in the other gospels fix his
stories. It’s even clearer in Greek because, like a couple of teachers
or copy editors, Matthew and Luke consistently fix Mark’s bad Greek
grammar. The weight of evidence points to Mark as the earliest
gospel and to Matthew and Luke as later editors.
Trekking to another source in special
cases: The mysterious Q
There’s one more bit of evidence that you need in order to take the
role of detective with the historical Jesus. This evidence involves
cases where Mark doesn’t report something that the others do, as 
in Table 3-2, which is a synopsis of a saying about discipleship.

Chapter 3: Pursuing the Historical Jesus in the Gospels 45

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
46
In this case, Matthew and Luke couldn’t have taken the saying from
Mark, because Mark doesn’t mention it at all. (John doesn’t mention
this saying either, though this isn’t as surprising because John’s
gospel usually isn’t parallel to the other three.) What’s more, this
pattern happens more than 50 times in Matthew and Luke, and it’s
almost always teachings and sayings of Jesus.
This evidence makes it look like a list of Jesus’s sayings and teach-
ings was written up within a couple of decades after Jesus’s death 
to serve the needs of traveling preachers and settled folks who
wondered what Jesus taught. Both Matthew and Luke likely had
access to this mysterious source of sayings, commonly called Q
(see the nearby sidebar “Discovering Q: What is it and why is it
important?” for more information).
Luke’s version of these sayings is more embarrassing or awkward
than Matthew’s, which leads some scholars to the conclusion that
Luke’s version is more authentic to Q’s original form. That’s why 
Q passages in Matthew and Luke are usually referenced simply by
the Lukan chapter and verse, such as Q 10:37–38 for the passage 
in Table 3-2. Another reason scholars think that Luke is more faith-
ful to Q is by analogy to the way Matthew and Luke use their other
source, Mark. Luke tends to preserve the order of Mark while
Matthew rearranges Mark’s material more freely to fit his themes.
It’s reasonable to assume that Matthew and Luke may have han-
dled this other shared source Q in similar fashion. Chapter 5 has
additional information on Q.
Discovering Q: What is it 
and why is it important?
It was 19th-century German scholars who figured out that the material shared only by
Matthew and Luke probably came from a preexisting source of Jesus’s sayings.
Apparently these scholars weren’t very imaginative, because when they finally settled
on a name for the thing, they called the document “source,” which is Quellein German.
Ever since then, people have shortened the name to “Q.”
Q doesn’t actually exist. But sayings gospels do. In 1898, for example, some Greek 
fragments of an otherwise unknown Gospel of Thomas were discovered in
Oxyrhynchus, Egypt. Forty-seven years later, a more complete version of the gospel in
the Coptic language with 114 sayings was found among some other Gnostic Christian
texts in Nag Hammadi, Egypt. This gospel looks a lot like the hypothetical Q; it’s mostly
a list of Jesus’s sayings. It proves that such sayings sources circulated. Even though
the manuscripts of the Gospel of Thomas are considered late (200–340 CE), many of its
sayings overlap with Q in forms that are more awkward (and therefore maybe earlier).
It also reflects some teachings that date from the second century CE.

 Understanding the responses to the earliest questions about Jesus
 Showing the impact of the Enlightenment
 Discovering the many quests for the historical Jesus
T
he historical Jesus has been important for 2,000 years, but often
in different ways. When Jesus’s companions preached about him,
for example, they told stories of his life, teachings, deeds, death, and
resurrection. They cared about who he had been as well as who they
believed he still was. Later, people wrote these stories down. And
later still, others put some of these stories in the Bible. The earliest
Christian controversies were about how Jesus could be historical
and eternal — or to put it another way, human and divine — at the
same time. But even though the historical Jesus has been important
throughout Christian history, it has only been in the last couple of
centuries that his earthly life has come under close scrutiny.
In this chapter, I help you discover the early questions about Jesus. 
I show you the causes of recent interest in the historical Jesus and
guide you through the scholarly debates about who Jesus really was.
Responding to the First Critical
Questions about Jesus
Some people think that the quest for the historical Jesus started
with the Enlightenment in the 18th century. That’s a natural place to
start the story, because during the Enlightenment, rationally minded
folks began to subject all supposed “truths” to scientific scrutiny.

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
48
But the truth is that Jesus had been subjected to scrutiny of one
kind or another from the moment he first began to preach. As one
of my professors used to say: Just because people lived in antiquity
doesn’t mean they were stupid!
In the following sections, I explain the ways in which Christians
responded to the earliest questions and rumors about Jesus.
Gospels galore: Which of 
the gospels are true?
When some of Jesus’s better-educated followers sat down to 
write the story of Jesus, they called their stories evangelia (or
“good news,” which became “gospel” in Old English). About two
dozen gospels have survived from the first few Christian centuries.
By the mid- to late-second century, four of these gospels had
emerged as widespread (though not universal) favorites. By and
large they’re also the earliest, dating from the late first century.
One of the main reasons that the gospels were written was to pro-
vide explanations that Christians could use to defend their beliefs.
As you can imagine, the sheer number of stories quickly became
part of the problem. These stories didn’t always agree with one
another, so no one was sure which ones were true. (Flip to Chapter
5 for more on these many gospels, and to Chapter 3 for tips on
weighing their reliability).
Some groups of Christians decided that the confusion was too
much, so they picked one gospel as the gospel. Tatian, a Syriac
Christian, took the four main gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John (see Chapter 2) and fused them into one continuous Greek
account called the Diatessaron (which is Greek for “[one] out of
four”). When these gospels were fused, the contradictions among
them were removed. However, the mainstream or orthodox church
opted as early as the 180s CE to keep the four gospels.
In 313 CE, when the Roman Emperor Constantine legalized
Christianity, he did so in part to help unify the large number of
Christians in his empire. Different groups of these Christians were
reading different stories and believing different things about Jesus.
So, in 325 CE Constantine set out to solve this problem. He called
together the bishops — the leaders of the regional Christian
churches — to get their stories straight. They had the authority 
to decide on behalf of their churches what counted as orthodox
(or true faith and tradition). To solve the problem of competing 
traditions, these bishops created a canon (an official list of books 
in the Bible). This meeting of the minds also led to the large-scale
production of complete manuscripts of the Bible.

Divine or not divine: What’s 
the true nature of Jesus?
The earliest followers of Jesus were often on the defensive as they
preached about Jesus’s life, death, and divine identity. For instance,
when the apostle Paul told his Jewish and Greek audience in Corinth
that Jesus was God’s messiah and son and was crucified, he was met
with a lot of criticism. The Jews found the cross to be a stumbling
block and the pagans found it foolish (1 Corinthians 1:10–31). In
other words, Jews weren’t expecting a messiah who would fail, and
the pagans couldn’t imagine that a god would become human, let
alone die as a common criminal.
As for the story that Jesus had risen from the dead, rumors circu-
lated in the first 50 years after Jesus’s death (30–80 CE) that his 
followers had stolen his body so that nobody could disprove their
claim that he was alive. In fact, Matthew mentions this rumor in his
gospel (Matthew 27:62–66; 28:11–15). Clearly the early Christians
had a lot of explaining to do!
The following sections offer a sample of the arguments that later
groups had regarding the divine nature of Jesus.
The pagans’ thoughts on the matter
Despite the earliest doubts of Jesus’s divinity, by the second and
third centuries CE, Christianity was spreading and pagan critics in
particular began to be alarmed. These critics called the Christians
atheists because they didn’t worship the Roman gods.
As Christianity spread in the second and third centuries CE, 
Greco-Roman philosophers like Celsus (second century) studied the
Christian story and raised all kinds of doubts. For example, Celsus
wanted to know whether Jesus was born to a virgin or whether he
was just a bastard whose birth story was made over into something
nobler. He also questioned how he could be God, or even just an
effective leader of men, when his own followers admitted to aban-
doning him in his hour of need. In the end, they wanted to know
whether he was a miracle worker or a magician, a god or a fraud.
Origen (185–254 CE) was a philosophically minded Christian who
carefully responded to each of Celsus’s critiques in his not-so-
creatively titled book, Against Celsus (248 CE). Regarding Jesus’s
humble roots, Origen replied that it only makes his influence that
much more amazing. To Jesus’s betrayal by his own followers,
Origen countered that Jesus knew in advance that this would
happen and that he allowed it out of obedience to God.

Debates among Christians in the 1500s
Some of the fiercest debates that Christians had historically were
with each other. As they studied their Bibles in the Middle Ages
and Renaissance (especially from about 1200–1500), they began to
realize that Jesus’s community of disciples and Jesus’s teachings
were quite different from what the European Catholic Church had
become. Some wanted to restore the Church to what they thought
it had been in the beginning. This impulse would later give rise to
the quest for the historical Jesus himself. But in the short term, it
spawned the Reformation in the 16th century and two centuries of
bloody religious conflicts among Protestants, Catholics, and the
governments allied with them. This bloodshed and the competing
claims of Christian groups fostered a profound distrust of religious
authority, a distrust that would help give rise to the Enlightenment.
The Enlightenment’s Impact 
on the Perception of Jesus
The 16th- and 17th-century discoveries by Copernicus, Kepler, and
Galileo that the earth was not the center of the universe disrupted
the notions that had been held since the time of Aristotle and that
many took to be revealed in the Bible (see Joshua 10:12–14, where
the sun is stopped in its presumed orbit around the earth).
The discovery of the so-called “New World” at about the same time
presented some problems, too. The Bible said that Adam was the
father of all people (Genesis 5–11) but inconveniently failed to men-
tion the Aztecs (and Incas and Mayans and so on). How could the
Bible be divine revelation if it was incomplete or, worse yet, wrong?
All these discoveries challenged the notion that the Bible was true
or accurate in an absolute sense and opened the door for questions
about its portrait of Jesus.
The rise of the universities, the Reformation and its bloody after-
math, and new discoveries in the world and in the sciences gave
rise to the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment (1600–1800 CE).
What characterized these movements was the shift to reason as
the basis for authority. Imagining themselves to be freed from blind
tradition, religious superstition, and political tyranny, scientists
and philosophers sought to use rational inquiry to discern the
laws of nature apart from divine revelation and develop a more
progressive society.
In the following sections, I discuss the effect that all these 
discoveries had on understanding the historical Jesus.

Applying science to Jesus
During the Enlightenment, biblical scholars worked in the same
universities with scientists. They were reading one another’s work.
It was just a matter of time before these theologians began applying
the scientific method to the biblical texts and to Jesus himself. After
all, Christianity has always been a religion about a man. So, Jesus’s
life should be able to be studied in the ways you would study any
human being. The results of such a study might not exhaust his 
significance for all people, but they should be vital to a religion 
that privileges humanity and history the way Christianity does.
Going after the gospels: The birth 
of deism and reactions to it
A new form of religious faith, called deism, came to birth in the
Enlightenment. Deists believed in a supremely rational God who
didn’t intervene in this world. He created a universe that operated
by immutable laws and then he left it to run on its own. Deists didn’t
approve of anything that smacked of divine intervention, such as
miracles, resurrections, or divine prophecies supposedly fulfilled 
in history. As you can imagine, this didn’t leave them with much of 
a gospel (see the nearby sidebar “Thomas Jefferson’s gospel” for
more information). For them, Jesus was at most a teacher of 
universal morality; he wasn’t God and performed no miracles.
In the following section, I introduce you to the most important deist
in historical Jesus studies — H. S. Reimarus — and the reaction he
provoked in the 19th century.
H. S. Reimarus and the deceiving disciples
As a German deist, Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694–1768) wasn’t
the first to dispute Jesus’s miracles and resurrection. But he was
the first to imagine who Jesus could have been if he wasn’t the
risen savior that Christians had “mistaken” him for. For Reimarus,
Jesus was fully human and only human. He thought that Jesus was
a Jew who could only be understood within the context of Judaism.
Reimarus believed that Jesus’s message of repentance, the coming
kingdom of God, and the end of this world proved to be wrong. In
his eyes, Christian doctrine had completely misunderstood Jesus
by making him a divine savior of the world.
Reimarus traced this apparent deception to the disciples them-
selves. He said that they had expected that Jesus would establish
God’s kingdom and that they would be his right-hand men. When
Jesus was executed instead, the disciples invented the claim that
he had risen and would soon return. So, according to Reimarus,
Chapter 4: Sharing in the Quests: Appreciating Modern Scholar Efforts 51

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
52
Christianity is based on two failed ends: the one that Jesus pre-
dicted and the one that the disciples expected. The disciples,
Reimarus believed, perpetrated a fraud in their preaching and in
the gospels, and Christians bought it.
Reimarus decided not to publish his thoughts while he was still
alive (gee, can you guess why?). His student, Gotthold Ephraim
Lessing, published some of them in Germany just after Reimarus’s
death (1774–1778). But to protect Reimarus’s reputation, Lessing
wouldn’t reveal his teacher’s name. In fact, nobody knew who the
author of the fragments was for another 40 years.
Many late 18th and early 19th century scholars were troubled by
Reimarus’s ideas. They couldn’t imagine that the disciples’ claims
were really fraudulent and that they were using the good news as a
cover for Jesus’s failed political mission. But if the disciples weren’t
trying to deceive people, what in the world were they trying to com-
municate through their miracle stories? Some scholars thought that
they were telling the literal truth, that divine agency was at work in
Jesus (these folks were called “supernaturalists”). On the other side
were scholars who thought that the gospels were reporting some-
thing amazing that was nevertheless completely natural (these folks
were called “naturalists”). For example, in the story of Jesus feeding
a huge crowd (Mark 6:34–52), the supernaturalists said that God
multiplied the few loaves of bread, while the naturalists said that
Jesus prompted everyone to share what they’d brought.
Thomas Jefferson’s gospel
Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), a founding father of the United States and its third
president (1801–1809), is well known as the principal author of the Declaration of
Independence. But, what you may not know is that he also wrote a gospel of his
own called The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth.
Jefferson was a deist, so he considered the official gospels to be subpar. All the 
stories about miracles and prophecies, the virgin birth, and the resurrection flew in the
face of nature and reason. Jefferson judged these stories to be corruptions introduced
by unlettered disciples. So, in 1803, he set out cutting up copies of the gospels (in Greek,
Latin, French, and English) until he had made “a wee little book” excerpting Jesus’s
clearest teachings and parables. He completed the book in 1819, which is the year he
founded the University of Virginia. But he didn’t publish the book, fearing the inevitable
“swarm of insects, whose buzzing is more disquieting than their bite.” After all, during
his run for the presidency in 1800, several clergymen called him an infidel, a 
materialist, and an atheist — and that was before he ever wrote this book (and might
be precisely what prompted it). The book was first published in 1895.

D. F. Strauss’s reaction to Reimarus
In 1835, a theologian and philosopher by the name of David
Friedrich Strauss (1808–1874) offered a resolution to the 
controversy between the supernaturalists and the naturalists 
(see the previous section). Like a good Enlightenment thinker,
Strauss believed that God didn’t intervene in nature, so he rejected
the supernaturalists’ view of miracles. But he didn’t accept the 
naturalists’ explanations either (check out Chapter 12 for more on
modern views of miracles). In Strauss’s eyes, Jesus didn’t multiply
the loaves and fish and nobody shared theirs, either. In his view, 
no historical event gave rise to this story.
So does that mean that Strauss saw the miracles as the disciples’
fraudulent invention, like Reimarus? Not at all. Instead, Strauss
offered a new way to look at the miracles. They didn’t arise from
historical events in Jesus’s life, but rather from the worldview of
the gospel writers. He argued that the disciples’ beliefs in Jesus’s
divinity unconsciously colored their stories about him. Strauss
said that the language available to the disciples at the time wasn’t
language that makes sense to rationalistic minds. Instead, it was
mythological language. By using the term “myth,” Strauss meant
that the stories were spontaneous, unreflective acts of poetic imagi-
nation. In other words, strip away this mythological language in
the gospels and you’re left with a historical Jesus who’s an ideal
human being. According to Strauss, Jesus is no more divine than
you or me; he isn’t unique.
Unfortunately for his career, Strauss published under his own
name in 1835 at the age of 27 and was subsequently shunned by
theologians for rendering so much of the gospels fiction, denying 
the divinity of Jesus, and drawing such a firm line between history
and faith. After publishing his ideas, he wasn’t able to get a job
teaching theology, and by the time he died he had completely 
disavowed his Christian faith. But his work couldn’t be ignored,
and, in fact, it spawned the first quest for the historical Jesus.
The First “Liberal” Quest 
for the Historical Jesus
The ideas of deist historian Hermann Samuel Reimarus and the
Christian theologian David Friedrich Strauss (which I discuss earlier
in this chapter) spawned the following three different responses,
one of which led to the first quest for the historical Jesus:
 On one end of the spectrum were the skeptics who thought
Christian belief should be abandoned entirely.
Chapter 4: Sharing in the Quests: Appreciating Modern Scholar Efforts 53

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
54
 On the opposite end of the spectrum were those people who
held fast to their convictions that Jesus was the divine son of
God who worked miracles and rose from the dead. For them,
the gospels were accurate, historical records of his life.
 In between the two ends of the spectrum were the folks who
wanted to renew Christian belief by discovering the historical
Jesus who existed before the Christian Church made him God.
These folks were called “liberal” theologians because they
didn’t start with the assumption that biblical statements were
true simply because they were revealed. Instead, they viewed
the gospels as human witnesses to revelation that could only
be understood in their original historical and cultural contexts.
In the following sections, I discuss the major principles and prac-
tices behind the “liberal” quest, the quest’s collapse, and how that
collapse led to the two more recent quests.
Outlining the principles and 
practices of the liberal quest
The first scholars involved in the liberal quest sought to view Jesus
in his historical context. If these liberal truth-seekers were going to
discover the historical Jesus, they would have to embark on a quest
through the four biblical gospels, and they would have to separate
the earliest tidbits of history from the later faith additions.
So, various scholars set out to discover the life of Jesus and to 
provide 19th century Christians with believable portraits of his life.
Unlike Reimarus, these scholars didn’t take the gospels to be frauds,
and unlike Strauss, they thought they could squeeze out some his-
torical juice from the mythological miracles and dogmatic teachings
about Jesus’s divine nature. They sought the “true” life of Jesus by
breaking the gospels down into their components — their sources
and episodes — and then they painted their portraits of Jesus from
these earliest pieces. These scholars also often infused a lot of
imagination into their portraits because of their interest in the 
psychology and personality of Jesus.
A good example of this imaginative approach comes from Ernest
Renan. His 1863 book, The Life of Jesus, was written with romantic
flourish and was extremely popular. But it was also condemned by
many Church officials and Christian scholars because in his effort
to make Jesus universally relevant, Renan emphasized Jesus as a
great moral teacher rather than God.
Two other scholars, Heinrich Julius Holtzmann (1832–1910) and
Johannes Weisse (1863–1914), worked carefully on the gospel evi-
dence and presented their findings, arguing that Mark’s gospel was

earliest and presented the most historical portrait of Jesus, the
eschatological preacher. But they discovered too little historical
evidence to write a biography of Jesus, so they hesitated to fill in
the blanks.
A lot of good, careful work was done during this time. Scholars 
came to appreciate that the four biblical gospels weren’t entirely
the creation of their authors, but were faithful attempts to pass on
traditions from the oral preaching of the earliest Church. They
developed rules to test which passages were earlier than others
(see Chap-ter 3), and on this basis, they judged Mark’s gospel to be
the first one written (and most scholars still agree with that idea).
Facing facts: The flawed 
quest collapses
The first “liberal” quest began to fall apart at the end of the 19th 
century (1892–1906). It was brought down by other biblical scholars
who, like you, were curious about the historical Jesus but found the
quest flawed. The errors these scholars noted were clear:
 The earliest gospel isn’t historical. According to William
Wrede’s The Messianic Secret, published in 1902, the earliest
gospel is Mark’s gospel, but that doesn’t mean it paints a pic-
ture of the historical Jesus. It incorporates beliefs about Jesus
that developed after his historical life, just as the later gospels
do. It’s a faith statement, not a history book.
 The gospels don’t preserve the historical sequence of Jesus’s
life. In his The So-Called Historical Jesus and the Historical
Biblical Christ (published in 1896), Martin Kähler noticed that
the episodes inside the gospel stories are arranged differently
by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. There’s no way to figure out
whose sequence of events corresponded best to Jesus’s actual
life, apart from the obvious birth-ministry-death framework.
 Jesus’s message was particular, not universal. According to
Johannes Weiss’s book, Jesus’ Proclamation of the Kingdom of
God, published in 1892, Jesus wasn’t simply a moral teacher; 
he was a Jewish prophet of the end-times. His message wasn’t
about universal morals, as so many 19th-century scholars
thought, but about an imminent end of the world. That made his
message particular and time-bound, not universal and timeless.
 Jesus’s teaching is irrelevant to the modern world.
In The Quest of the Historical Jesus, published in 1906, Albert
Schweitzer said that Jesus thought God’s kingdom was coming
soon. So, he preached a really tough “interim ethic” for that
short time before the end (prohibiting divorce, encouraging
Chapter 4: Sharing in the Quests: Appreciating Modern Scholar Efforts 55

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
56
followers to leave their families to follow him). Because he was
wrong about the timing, the tough “morals” of the great moral
teacher are irrelevant for subsequent generations.
 Any life story of Jesus is hopelessly subjective. Schweitzer
noted that the many “lives” of Jesus made him look like a 19th
century rationalist, not a first-century Jewish man. The modern
authors have just projected what they wanted or needed Jesus
to be in the gospels.
Responding to the collapse
After the collapse of the first “liberal” quest, some of those who 
still considered themselves Christian biblical scholars contented
themselves to continue close scrutiny of the component parts of
the gospels so they could reconstruct Jesus and the earliest Church.
Others admitted that the gospels told more about the late first 
century and so they put their energies into imagining those years.
Another important response to the collapse of the first “liberal”
quest was to disavow the need for the historical Jesus altogether. 
A great example of this response came from the German New
Testament scholar Rudolph Bultmann (1884–1976). After years 
of carefully stripping mythological elements from the earliest com-
ponent parts of the gospels, Bultmann concluded that he couldn’t
recover the historical Jesus from them. But he also believed that it
wasn’t necessary to do so. For this good Lutheran, it mattered less
what the historical Jesus did than what God accomplished through
Jesus’s death and resurrection. Bultmann believed that it was God’s
grace, not Jesus’s works, that mattered — the “Christ of faith” was
more important than the “Jesus of history.”
Bultmann’s position made some people nervous, including his 
own students and a lot of liberal Protestant scholars who were 
convinced that Jesus’s historical life mattered. To them, it sounded
like he was erasing the human dimension of Jesus, which was so
central to Christian faith. So, they broke with his preference for the
Christ of faith and returned to the Jesus of history to see what they
could find.
Venturing Out on the Second Quest
After a hiatus in the first half of the 20th century, the second 
quest began with the renewed belief that some historical material
could be gleaned from the gospels, and that a historical tradition
like Christianity had to grapple with it. Ernst Käsemann (1906–1998)
started the new quest for the historical Jesus in Germany in the
years just after World War II (1953–1970).

Käsemann reasoned that the historical Jesus was important enough
to the earliest Church that its members wrote stories about him. So
the historical Jesus should be important for Christians now as well.
And because the gospel authors cared enough to describe Jesus as
the man rather than just the risen man, Käsemann figured that some
continuity must exist between the Church’s preaching and Jesus and
between the gospels and history. So he and others set out on the
second quest (sometimes called the “new quest”).
In this effort, Käsemann was joined by several other scholars,
including Herbert Braun (1903–1991), Ernst Fuchs (1903–1983),
Günther Bornkamm (1905–1990), Gerhard Ebeling (1912–2001),
Hans Conzelmann (1915–1989), and Walter Schmithals (1934– ) in
Germany, and James M. Robinson (1924– ) in the United States.
In the following sections, I explain how second questers applied
the rules of historicity to gospel texts, and I also note how certain
ideas and events shaped the second quest.
Applying the rules of historicity
The folks on the second quest systematically exposed and applied
the rules of historicity to the gospel texts (these are rules for figur-
ing out how likely something is to have happened; you can find
these rules in Chapter 3). For them, the most important rule was
“discontinuity”: the principle that when Jesus did something in 
the gospels that was different from prior Jewish tradition or later
Church teaching, these traditions are likely authentic. They based
this on the belief that Jesus must have stood out from human 
culture in order to have been memorable, compelling, and original.
Reshaping the second quest
The second quest viewed Jesus as completely dissimilar from
human culture, contemporary Judaism, and early Christian teaching.
This dissimilarity struck a lot of scholars as pretty implausible. They
wondered how anyone could have understood Jesus if he was so
unusual. And, how could a tradition have developed after him that
had so little continuity with his teachings? So, scholars began to
shift their assumptions. They started to imagine another scenario:
That Jesus was best understood as a Jew, not as a sort of alien off-
spring of Judaism, and that his teachings could be perceived in early
Christian teaching.
Along with the problems regarding Jesus’s dissimilarity, two other
factors also reshaped the quest: the Holocaust and the discovery
of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Chapter 4: Sharing in the Quests: Appreciating Modern Scholar Efforts 57

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
58
The Holocaust
More than six million Jews were targeted for slaughter in Nazi
Germany from 1939–1945 (the “Holocaust” or “Shoah”). They were
killed on the basis of their supposed racial inferiority. This racial
inferiority theory was secular, not religious, but it depended for its
widespread popularity on a long-standing Christian prejudice
against the Jews.
This prejudice had been present in historical Jesus studies from at
least the 19th century. For example, when Reimarus and Schweitzer
said that Jesus was not God but simply was a Jewish prophet and
was therefore irrelevant to modern minds, the teaching that mar-
ginalized Jesus also diminished the significance of Judaism. More
blatant and insidious were the attempts of Christian biblical schol-
ars in some of the great theological schools of Nazi Germany to
transform Jesus into an Aryan whose mission had been to destroy
Judaism. That piece of the historical Jesus quest has only begun to
be explored; you won’t usually find it mentioned in books about the 
historical Jesus.
The horror of the Holocaust awakened Christians to the fact that
their own ideas about Jesus and Christian origins fed (and fed off 
of) anti-Semitism — even while some of the historical Jesus scholars
had opposed the policies of Nazi Germany at great personal risk (for
example, Bultmann). As the reality of the Holocaust became clear in
the 1950s and 1960s, Christian and Jewish scholars began to work
more closely together to appreciate Jesus the Jew.
The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls
Just two years after World War II ended and on the eve of the 
creation of the state of Israel, the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.
While none of the over 800 manuscripts mentions Jesus, there are
scads of information about the group that wrote and gathered the
scrolls (you can read about this group, the Essenes, in Chapter 7).
This discovery provided a sudden infusion of sources other than 
the gospels for building a picture of Jewish society in Jesus’s time.
With this new information, the gospel portraits began to look 
too simplistic because they lumped together groups as Jesus’s 
enemies who in fact had very different interests, ideas, and beliefs.
The assumption that Jesus must have been dissimilar from Judaism
also began to fall apart. In fact, Jesus was looking more and more
Jewish. More importantly, scholars realized that the backdrop of
Judaism against which they had painted Jesus was colored more 
by their assumptions than by actual evidence. They had to eat 
some major humble pie and repaint the backdrop, and when 
they did, they discovered that Jesus fit in quite nicely. And 
that’s when a new, third quest began.

The Third Quest: Plural 
Portraits of a Preacher
The third quest, which began in the 1970s, continues today and
attempts to understand Jesus in the historical and cultural context
of first-century Judaism, using all the available archaeological, 
historical, and textual evidence. So, instead of looking for Jesus’s
discontinuities with Judaism, early Christianity, and human culture,
the third-quest scholars seek the opposite: continuities. For them,
the goal is to create a plausible portrait of Jesus. In other words,
they want to create a portrait that best explains all the evidence, fits
Jesus into his time and place, and accounts best for what happened.
Because the goal is plausibility, a final portrait depends on what a
third quester thinks Jesus’s chief activities and concerns were and
how that quester understands the society and politics of Jesus’s
time. Given that and the sheer variety of sources available, no uni-
form portrait of Jesus has emerged yet. Instead, different scholars
have developed different portraits or images of the Palestinian
Jewish preacher. According to several different scholars today,
Jesus was
 A wandering philosopher, preaching parables and pithy 
sayings
 An anti-Temple wisdom teacher
 A charismatic holy man and miracle worker/shaman
 A spirit-filled exorcist
 A prophet of the end-times
 A radical social reformer
 A rebel against Rome and a social bandit
You’ll find these portraits of Jesus filling books on the bookstore
shelves written by scholars such as Burton Mack, F. Gerald Downing,
Marcus Borg, Geza Vermes, Stevan L. Davies, Graham H. Twelftree, 
E. P. Sanders, Bart D. Ehrman, Paula Fredriksen, John P. Meier, Dale
Allison, N. T. Wright, Gerd Theissen, John Dominic Crossan, and
Richard A. Horsley, among others.
You also may have heard of a group of scholars called “The Jesus
Seminar” who have been engaged for a couple of decades in their
own quest for the true words and actions of Jesus (see the nearby
sidebar “The Jesus Seminar”).
Chapter 4: Sharing in the Quests: Appreciating Modern Scholar Efforts 59

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
60
For all their differences, these various portraits all try to under-
stand Jesus in the context of first-century Judaism (the first por-
trait, which views Jesus as a kind of Greek philosopher, is a little
different; it depends on a view of his home region, the Galilee, as a
heavily Hellenized Jewish territory). And, secondly, these portrait
creators all look beyond the Bible to all the gospels, sources of
gospels (like “Q”), and other texts that were written in the first
couple centuries (you can read about these in Chapter 5).
The Jesus Seminar
In 1985, Dr. Robert Funk gathered a group of 30 North American biblical scholars in
northern California to renew the historical Jesus quest. They call their meeting “The
Jesus Seminar.” Meeting twice a year since 1985, the group has set as its task the
reconstruction of the actual words and deeds of Jesus. They have published the
results of their votes in several books, including The Parables of Jesus (1988), The
Five Gospels (1993), and The Acts of Jesus (1998). In these books, they differentiate
four levels of a text’s likely historicity through color-coding (red equals historical,
pink equals probable, gray equals unlikely, and black equals unhistorical).
However, The Jesus Seminar has come under a lot of fire from other scholars and
clergy for a variety of reasons, including the following:
 The Fellows of the seminar aren’t all trained scholars, and those who are don’t
represent a very broad array of backgrounds, institutions, or countries.
 Their technique of voting doesn’t allow much room for nuance or persuasion,
even if they discuss arguments in advance of the vote.
 They consider as most historical the sayings of Jesus that occur in Q (passages
that Matthew and Luke share) and the gospel of Thomas (a sayings gospel), but
there may be material in other sources that’s arguably earlier and would make
Jesus look a bit different.
 They rely on the criterion of dissimilarity more heavily than other third questers.
 The resulting portrait of a modest wise man doesn’t jibe with the fact that Jesus
was executed.
The Jesus Seminar has generated a lot of debate because it finds little historical 
evidence for certain Christian beliefs, such as the virgin birth, the divinity of Jesus,
and the resurrection.

Chapter 5
Checking the Sources 
for Evidence of Jesus
In This Chapter
 Following the trail of the earliest Christian evidence
 Tracing Christian traditions in heretical and hidden books
 Investigating Jewish and Roman sources
 Excavating the physical evidence
You might suspect that someone as important as Jesus would
have left a trail of physical evidence behind. After all, almost
everyone who lives in the world does. For instance, if you’ve ever
tried to research your family tree, you know that there are often 
all kinds of records, from birth certificates to marriage licenses 
to newspaper articles. Then there are also the physical artifacts,
such as diaries, personal belongings and, of course, the skeleton
and grave (or ashes and urn). Combine all these items with the
many oral stories that your family tells, and you have a treasure
trove of tangible proof that helps paint a portrait of your ances-
tors. So, it’s reasonable to ask whether this kind of evidence exists
for Jesus as well.
In this chapter, you find out what information is available about 
the life of Jesus. You hear from early Christians, Jews, and Romans,
you sift through the physical artifacts, and you discover traces of
tradition in the books that didn’t make it into the Bible.
All the evidence in this chapter reveals that Jesus really existed 
in Roman Palestine in the first century CE and that he was crucified
by the Roman authorities. For the details of his life, the earliest
Christian sources remain our most important witnesses. Modern 
historians count the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas as an important
early witness as well, and the Dead Sea Scrolls provide general 
clues about Jewish society in Jesus’s time.

Exposing the Earliest 
Christian Evidence
Jesus’s followers left behind the biggest body of evidence about
him, which makes things tricky if you’re a historian because the
evidence is so biased. So how do you read a text for history when
its authors were interested in giving you so much more? In addi-
tion to the rules that I outline in Chapter 3, the most basic thing
you have to do is to figure out what your earliest sources are. For
Christian evidence, that’s the sources behind the gospels, Paul’s
epistles, and the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas.
Peeling back the gospel layers: 
An alphabet soup of sources
When the authors of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John sat down 
to write their gospels, they did what many college students would
do: They gathered all the sources they could and then combined 
the information from them with their own thoughts. However, these
authors often added their own special traditions, too, such as par-
ticular sayings or stories told by Jesus or deeds that he did. So, to
uncover the historical Jesus, you have to peel back the gospel layers
to expose all the earlier sources and traditions underneath.
The sources in the following sections are early and independent 
of each other, which makes them valuable as historical evidence
because they haven’t influenced each other.
The source with Jesus’s sayings and parables: Q
Behind the gospels of Matthew and Luke is a list of Jesus’s sayings
and parables. This list includes some famous passages, such as
 The three temptations of Jesus (Luke 4:2–13; Matthew 4:2–11)
 The beatitudes (Luke 6:20–23; Matthew 5:3–12)
 The lesson on loving enemies and turning the other cheek
(Luke 6:27–30; Matthew 5:39–44)
 The Lord’s Prayer (Luke 11:2–4; Matthew 6:9–13)
Because Matthew and Luke have nearly identical sayings and para-
bles for 50 separate passages that aren’t in Mark, it looks like they
were both copying from some prior list that modern scholars simply
call Q (from the German Quelle, which means “source” — flip to
Chapter 3 for more on Q). Though we’ve never found this list, it can
be reconstructed easily by simply listing those 50 parallel passages

Chapter 5: Checking the Sources for Evidence of Jesus 63
in Matthew and Luke. And it must predate those gospels by about 10
to 15 years to buy time for Matthew and Luke to hear about it and
get their hands on copies. If the list was in fact written around 50–
60 CE, it can be considered our earliest testimony to Jesus.
When the Gospel of Thomas was discovered in 1945 (I discuss this
gospel later in this chapter), it gave the theory of Q’s existence a
big boost. The Gospel of Thomas is a “gospel” composed almost
entirely of sayings and teachings of Jesus. It even overlaps with 
Q material in some cases. It proves that such “sayings gospels” 
did circulate in the early Christian churches.
Q includes mostly Jesus’s teachings. It doesn’t tell many stories, 
and most importantly, it doesn’t narrate Jesus’s death and resur-
rection (though it predicts a bad end). Q gives the impression that
Jesus was a wandering preacher, calling others to an itinerant life
and preaching that the end was near. But unlike the guy with the
apocalyptic sandwich board standing on a street corner in New York
City, Jesus has status. Q never calls him a messiah, but it does refer
to Jesus as the wisdom of God and the “Son of Man.” Both titles
convey that he’s clearly the unique agent of God’s salvation.
Most Q scholars believe that Q was written in stages, and whatever
they identify as the earliest stage would be closest to the message
of the historical Jesus. But they don’t agree on what those stages
were. Some think that the earliest Jesus movement presented Jesus
as a wisdom teacher and that later Christians made him over into 
an apocalyptic prophet of judgment as they encountered opposition
to their preaching. Others think the transformation went the other
way: The end-of-times judgment material was earliest and it was
made over later with wisdom teachings. The existence of these two
camps is one reason why there are two types of portraits of the 
historical Jesus today. One camp views him as a Hellenistic Jewish
wisdom teacher, and the other views him as a Jewish apocalyptic
prophet (flip to Chapter 4 for more about that).
Matthew’s missing source: M
M is what scholars call a special Matthean source that’s thought 
to be behind the stories that are found only in Matthew’s gospel,
including several parables (Matthew 13:24–52; 18:23–35) and the
famous story of the final judgment (Matthew 25:31–46). But if these
teachings of Jesus were really written by a single person before
Matthew, you’d expect all the stories to have similar vocabulary,
style, and themes. And, frankly, they just aren’t that consistent. The
result is that the three scholars who have attempted to trace M’s
contents — B.H. Streeter (1927), T.W. Manson (1935, 1949), and G.D.
Kilpatrick (1946) — all have come up with different lists. So, it’s
doubtful that M existed as a single written source, as more recent
authors admit (S. H. Brooks, 1987; U. Schnelle, 1994; R.E. Van Voorst,

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
64
2000). Whether Matthew had one or more sources, these early tradi-
tions emphasize the authoritative role of Jesus as the founder of the
community and the interpreter of Jewish law.
Luke’s special source: L
Luke’s special source L may well have been written down before 
the author of Luke pulled his gospel together. L includes about 25
sayings, parables, and stories that are only in Luke’s gospel. These
stories, such as his famous parables of the Good Samaritan (Luke
10:29–37), the rich fool (Luke 12:16–21), the prodigal son (Luke
15:11–32), and the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19–23), all sound
similar to one another and are different from Luke’s typical vocabu-
lary and style. This suggests that someone wrote or told these 
stories before Luke did. Then Luke came along and incorporated
them into his own gospel along with Mark and Q, adding his own
ideas, settings, and themes. If Luke’s gospel was composed around
75–85 CE, as many scholars think, all of his written sources would
have to have been written before then, and thus somewhat closer
to the historical Jesus.
What does Jesus look like in L? He was a powerful teacher offering
God’s grace to people. He raised up the poor, healed the broken, 
and restored people to the family of God. Like Q, L ends before
Jesus’s death and resurrection. However, in L (unlike in Q), Jesus
wasn’t a radically poor and nomadic preacher who was calling
people to leave family and society behind. Instead, he appealed
to the wealthy and the poor — and thus to settled communities.
The gospel of Mark
Mark’s gospel is the earliest existing gospel and therefore an impor-
tant source for reconstructing the historical Jesus. In Mark’s gospel,
the picture of Jesus is that he is the messiah and Son of God and
that the crucifixion of Jesus is central to those roles. While these 
are features of the post-resurrection Christian faith rather than the
historical Jesus’s life, the rough-cut and awkward nature of Mark’s
version of Jesus’s life story suggest that the gospel has some early
material (see Chapter 3 for more information on awkwardness as 
a clue to the likelihood that an event happened).
The miracles behind John’s message: SQ
The author of John’s gospel includes seven signs or miracles that
demonstrate Jesus’s power and status as messiah. These miracles
include the following:
 Turning water into wine at a wedding in Cana (John 2:1–11)
 Healing a royal official’s son (who was in Capernaum) from
the city of Cana (John 4:46–54)

 Healing a man who had been paralyzed for 38 years 
(John 5:2–15)
 Feeding 5,000 people with five loaves of bread and two 
fish (John 6:1–14)
 Walking on water (John 6:15–21)
 Healing a man who was born blind (John 9:1–8)
 Raising Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1–44)
Toward the end of the gospel, the author also says something 
like this: “Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of the
disciples, which are not written in this book . . .” (John 20:30). This
statement suggests that the author knew of other signs performed
by Jesus, and perhaps that he had a gospel or source that included
all of them, from which he chose seven. This source is sometimes
called SQ, for semeia Quelle (semeia is Greek for “signs” and Quelle
is German for “source”). SQ was written before John’s gospel, and
some scholars believe it’s later than Q and L. SQ emphasizes Jesus
as messiah, whose power and status are proven by these signs.
This emphasis is different from Q and L, which both focus on
Jesus’s teaching rather than his superpowers (I discuss these
sources earlier in this chapter).
The Gospel of Thomas
The Gospel of Thomas is another early Christian gospel that bears
on the historical Jesus — only this one didn’t make it into the
Bible. This gospel was branded a heretical book, and people
thought it was lost for good until a collection of codices (bound
books) containing Gnostic and Greek materials was discovered in
the Egyptian desert of Nag Hammadi in 1945. (Gnostic comes from
the Greek word gnosis or “knowledge”; it was a term used for cer-
tain Christians who claimed a secret knowledge about the true
nature of the universe and Jesus’s role in it.)
The unearthed copy of the gospel is written in Coptic, a language
of upper Egypt that uses mostly Greek alphabetical characters to
transcribe Egyptian language. The gospel has 114 of Jesus’s say-
ings, a quarter of which are almost identical to sayings in Q and
Mark. Add the three other gospels in the New Testament (Matthew,
Luke, and John), and about half of the 114 sayings in the Gospel of
Thomas are similar to biblical sayings. The rest represent the teach-
ing of the Gnostic Christians (who I discuss in the later section, 
“The most famous heretical texts: Gnostic notions of Jesus”).
One of the most important things about the Gospel of Thomas 
is that it proves that sayings or parable sources like Q circulated
among early Christians (I discuss Q earlier in this chapter). Another
point is that the order of the sayings in the Gospel of Thomas is 
Chapter 5: Checking the Sources for Evidence of Jesus 65

different than in the biblical gospels, which suggests a separate,
independent source.
At times, the Gospel of Thomas seems earlier than the biblical
gospels, too, because its versions of sayings are shorter and haven’t
been layered with as much interpretation as the biblical versions.
But then there are other times when later Gnostic teaching about
the corruption of the world enters in. Consider saying 56, for exam-
ple: “He who has known the world has found a corpse, and he who
has found a corpse, the world is not worthy of him.” This saying
makes it sound as if Jesus had a pretty low opinion of this world and
a pretty high opinion of those who recognized its limitations. That’s
somewhat out of sync with Q, where Jesus certainly privileges God’s
world over this earth (Luke 12:4–5; Matthew 10:28) but also has a
good time enjoying himself (Luke 7:31–35; Matthew 11:16–19). Which
of the two traditions about Jesus is earlier, the world-hating Jesus or
the world-loving Jesus? Because the Thomas teaching sounds like
some later Gnostic Christian ideas about the evil nature of this
world, it seems to be later. This example shows that you have to
treat the Gospel of Thomas as you would a biblical gospel. If you’re
going to reconstruct the historical Jesus from it, you first have to
identify which verses are late and which are early.
Studying Paul’s epistles
The early Christian apostle Paul gives the earliest surviving written
testimony about Jesus (Q may have been written about the same
time, but it hasn’t actually survived). However, Paul himself never
met Jesus; in fact, when he first heard about Jesus, he made up his
mind to harass everyone who followed him because of the threat 
he thought they posed to the law and the traditions of the Jews
(Galatians 1:14; Philippians 3:4–6). But then something happened
to transform him from a persecutor to a promoter: He had an expe-
rience of the risen Jesus (Galatians 1:11–17; Acts 9:1–22; 22:4–16;
26:9–18). From that point on, Paul took it as his job to share the
good news with Jews and Gentiles (non-Jews) alike. He started 
traveling around the Mediterranean preaching, and then he wrote
epistles (Greek for “letters”) to Christian communities between 51
and the mid-60s CE, when he was killed.
What’s interesting about Paul’s references to the historical 
Jesus are how different they are from Q, L, and SQ. These alphabet
soup sources (which I discuss earlier in this chapter) emphasize
Jesus’s teachings and miracles and barely mention the death and
resurrection. However, Paul is just the opposite. For him, Jesus’s
cross and resurrection are the good news (1 Corinthians 1:18–25;
15:1–28; Romans 1–8). In fact, that’s all he talked about!
Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
66

Paul may have been focused on Jesus’s death and resurrection
because the people he was writing letters to in the various parts 
of the Mediterranean region already knew about Jesus. Preachers
regularly visited cities and shared stories of Jesus (some probably
with scrolls of Q tucked in their tunics!). So, Paul didn’t need to
make reference to Jesus’s teachings unless a particular problem
came up. For example, when the Corinthian Christians contacted
Paul to tell him that they were debating whether Christians could
divorce each other, he gave a command from “the Lord” that
divorce wasn’t allowed (1 Corinthians 7:10–11) — and then offered
some exceptions! But these citations of Jesus’s teaching are few and
far between. He was more interested in explaining the central piece
of the gospel, which for him was Jesus’s death and resurrection.
Paul said the following other historical things about Jesus, which
later appeared in the gospels:
 In Romans 1:3, Paul said that Jesus came from the line of King
David (see Matthew 1, Luke 3:31, and Mark 10:46–11:11).
 He said that Jesus’s mission was to the Jews, not the Gentiles
(Romans 15:8; compare to Mark 7:24–30).
 In 1 Corinthians 11:23–25, he preserved a tradition of Jesus’s
words at the Last Supper with his disciples (see Luke
22:19–20; Chapter 14 has more about the Last Supper).
 In 1 Thessalonians 4:15, he seemed to refer to a saying of Jesus
(or the risen Christ?) about how believers who have died will
nevertheless participate in the end-time return of the Lord.
This evidence is pretty limited, especially if the passage from 1
Thessalonians is a revelation of the risen Lord rather than the his-
torical Jesus. Taking just the other three passages, there’s nothing
here that isn’t in the gospels, though the fact that Paul corroborates
the gospels on these traditions is important.
Examining other New 
Testament texts
A couple of other New Testament texts outside the four gospels
and Paul’s epistles may refer to sayings of Jesus, but the pickings
are pretty slim. Here’s a list of the available material, with parallels
to sayings of Jesus in the gospels and Paul:
 Paul quotes one of Jesus’s sayings in Acts 20:35: “It is better 
to give than to receive.”
 Hebrews 5:7 mentions Jesus’s prayer for deliverance just
before his death (see Mark 14:34–40).
Chapter 5: Checking the Sources for Evidence of Jesus 67

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
68
 Hebrews 7:14 admits that Jesus is from the tribe of Judah.
This fact agrees with the gospel view that Jesus is from the
line of David but it complicates the epistle’s claim that Jesus
is the new high priest (the priests came from a different tribe).
 Jesus’s teaching against oaths is referred to in James 5:12,
though Jesus isn’t cited by name (see Matthew 5:34–37).
 The teaching about “the stone which the builders rejected” 
is mentioned in 1 Peter 2:7 (see Matthew 21:42; Luke 20:17).
 Jesus’s teaching that one should not return evil for evil comes
up in 1 Peter 3:9 (see Matthew 5:44; Luke 6:28; Romans 12:14).
 Revelation 3:3 and 16:15 refer to the approaching end of time
and how it will catch many people unaware. The language 
parallels material in Q (see Luke 12:39 and Matthew 24:43).
None of the previous texts give free-standing new material that’s
independent of Q or the gospels, so the gospels and their sources,
along with corroborating evidence from Paul’s epistles, remain our
most important literary evidence for Jesus.
Recovering Traces in Later
Christian Sources
Christians continued to write books about Jesus in the centuries
after his life. Sayings and complete stories were told in these books,
and many of them were quoted by early Church leaders. These
newest books add some (but not much) information to the 
historical record of Jesus.
Sayings in the agrapha
The word agrapha literally means “unwritten things” in Greek. It’s 
a bit of a misnomer in gospel studies, though, because it refers to
sayings and traditions about Jesus that were actually written down.
What makes them less reliable is that either they were late additions
to gospels that made the New Testament cut or they were recorded
in books that didn’t make the cut at all.
The story of the woman caught in adultery, for example, counts as
one major agraphon (John 7:53–8:11). The woman is thrown before
Jesus for judgment as the crowd stands ready to stone her. Jesus
first stoops to draw in the dirt, and then he says, “Let the one among
you without sin be first to cast a stone.” At that point the crowd
slowly dispersed. This story is a popular one in Christian tradition,

but it’s considered an agraphon because it isn’t in the earliest 
manuscripts of John’s gospel.
Overall, 225 such sayings are scattered in early gospel versions
and other writings that aren’t included in the New Testament. The
most frequently mentioned agraphon is also one of the briefest.
The one I’m talking about is when Jesus says, “Be competent
money-changers” (it’s cited more than 70 times by the early 
Church fathers but isn’t found in the New Testament at all).
Some agrapha seem to depend on the canonical gospels, which
means that they aren’t independent witnesses to traditions about
the historical Jesus (see Chapter 3). Others can be ruled out as 
evidence of the historical Jesus because they address second-
century issues and debates (such as Jesus’s sinless nature or Gnostic
notions of how people are saved). Because they’re so short, so late,
quoted out of context, and only able to be tested against Matthew,
Mark, and Luke, it’s difficult to know whether even a few of these
agrapha are authentic. Scholars estimate that only 7 to 18 of the 
original 225 agrapha may actually go back to Jesus.
Heretical and hidden traditions 
in complete texts
More significant than the brief agrapha sayings are the many 
complete books about Jesus that circulated in early Christianity,
apart from the 27 that later made it into the New Testament. Here’s 
a rundown of the types of books:
 Some of these books were gospels, apocalypses, and dialogues
that were judged by early Christian leaders or later church
councils to be heretical (contrary to mainstream teaching).
 Other books were gospels, acts of the various apostles, 
teachings, and legendary tales that were very popular in the
early Church but just weren’t considered worthy enough to
become actual “scripture” (see the sidebar “Making the New
Testament cut” for more information). This last group of books
is considered apocryphal, or hidden. These books weren’t
called this because they were actually hidden by anyone, 
but because they weren’t in the final published lists.
Because scholars look at any early sources they can get their 
hands on and because they can’t afford to rule books out based 
on judgments that later Christians made, they tend to read all this
material for possible evidence of Jesus. However, as you find out 
in the following sections, these books offer little help in the hunt for
the historical Jesus.

The most famous heretical texts: Gnostic notions of Jesus
The Gnostic gospels, dialogues, and apocalypses are the most
famous heretical books in early Christianity. These books are
famous not only because so many second-century Christians
denounced them, but also because many of them were actually
found in 1945.
The Gnostic gospels are very different from the canonical gospels
(Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). This difference was due to the
Gnostic teaching that the material world was evil and that the path
to salvation lay in cultivating the spark of gnosis (from the Greek
word for “knowledge”) implanted in each person. So, for this group
of Christians, Jesus’s earthly life was irrelevant, which meant that
they rarely told stories about it in their gospels.
Making the New Testament cut
As early as the first century CE, Christians were publishing all kinds of books about
Jesus. At some point, though, believers had to decide which ones were the most
important for all Christians. Church leaders made the final decisions, but the crite-
ria they used respected both history and the wider community of Christians. To make
the New Testament cut, a book had to be
 Apostolic: By apostolic, the leaders meant that the book had to be traceable to
one of the apostles or eyewitnesses. This criterion ruled out later texts.
 In traditional use: To be in traditional use, a text had to be in use from an early
period of the Church, and therefore cited by early Church fathers whose dates
are known.
 Catholic: When the Church fathers said that a text had to catholic, they meant
catholic with a small c, which is the Greek word for “universal.” The book there-
fore had to be in use in many Christian communities around the Mediterranean —
not just in a select few.
 Orthodox: By orthodox, the Church leaders meant that the book had to be in
sync with emerging mainstream Christian teaching.
Some Christian leaders also felt that books had to be suitable for public reading at
worship services; this meant that they had to meet the previously listed criteria and
be edifying rather than merely entertaining. And no doubt there were political fac-
tors as well. For example, gospels popular in the major urban centers, such as Rome
and Alexandria, would carry a lot of weight.
By about 180 CE, a consensus on 20 books was emerging. However, each person’s
list of 20 added a couple of other titles that differed from list to list. Eusebius, the great
Church historian under Constantine, published a list of 22 books in 325 CE.
Athanasius’s definitive Easter Letter in 367 CE provides the earliest evidence for the
current total of 27 books.

In one of the most famous archaeological finds of the 20th century,
a farmer digging for fertilizer found 13 codices (or bound books) in
an earthenware pot near Nag Hammadi in upper Egypt. These 13
books contained 46 separate works in Coptic (the language of
upper Egypt), including the following:
 The Gospels of Thomas and Philip
 The Gospel of Truth
 The Gospel of the Egyptians
Additional Gnostic materials were discovered in Oxyrhynchus 
and other Egyptian sites, including the Gospel of Mary (Magdalene),
Greek fragments of the Gospel of Thomas, and most recently, a third-
or fourth-century codex containing pages and fragments of these
books along with the Gospel of Judas.
I mention earlier in this chapter how the Gospel of Thomas is made
up of all sayings, no stories. So, Jesus may as well be disembodied!
In several of these books, he is disembodied — all the action takes
place after he’s risen and all the revelation is secret wisdom. In these
gospels, you won’t find any bodies healed, any meals with sinners,
any enjoyment of the earth, and any teachings about marriage. In
fact, the only intercourse that happens in these texts is the union
of human reason with divine reason (see the nearby sidebar “The 
Da Vinci Code and the Gospel of Judas” for more information).
These gospels were labeled heretical because the mainstream
Church had a more positive view of human bodies, sexuality, and
the material world in general. They valued the human and historical
Jesus. Besides, these gospels were written too late and were popu-
lar in only a few isolated places. Apart from some sayings in the
Gospel of Thomas, they don’t help reconstruct the historical Jesus.
Apocryphal texts
The early Church generated a lot of traditions regarding Jesus that
were wildly popular but didn’t make it into the Bible. The tradi-
tions take the same forms that the canonical books do: gospels,
acts of various apostles, letters, and apocalypses.
One of the most entertaining traditions is the infancy gospel tradi-
tion. The gospels of Matthew and Luke are the only canonical texts
to mention Jesus’s conception and birth. But they narrate very little
about his childhood. So, inquiring early Christian minds wanted to
know what his infancy in Egypt was like. They wanted to know more
about Jesus’s parents, Mary and Joseph, than the canonical gospels
dish up, particularly as the issue of Jesus’s virginal conception grew
in importance. And most of all, these early Christians wondered
what he was like as a child. After all, with all those divine powers,
Chapter 5: Checking the Sources for Evidence of Jesus 71

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
72
what would Jesus do when another kid bullied him or a teacher 
tried to discipline him? Your guess is right: The apocryphal infancy
gospels are littered with the bodies of playmates and adults who
rubbed little Jesus the wrong way.
It’s tough to reconstruct anything about the historical Jesus’s infancy
and childhood from Matthew and Luke’s gospels because they con-
tradict each other on important points (see Chapters 2 and 9 for
more on their accounts). However, later traditions in the apocryphal
infancy gospels that are merely legendary or entertaining or that
“prove” later Church teachings are on even shakier historical ground.
In the end, the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, the Arabic Infancy Gospel,
the Protoevangelium (pre-gospel) of James, and the Gospel of the
Nativity of Mary don’t help reconstruct Jesus’s actual infancy at all.
The same can be said of a few other apocrypha that are sometimes
alleged to offer evidence of the historical Jesus. The Gospel of Peter,
for example, has an account of Jesus’s passion and death that some
scholars believe lies behind the canonical passion accounts. But its
anti-Jewish stance, its emphasis on Jesus’s miracles, and its hints of
Gnosticism indicate second-century developments and legendary
The Da Vinci Code and the Gospel of Judas
The Gnostic gospels have been in the media spotlight because of Dan Brown’s 
bestseller The Da Vinci Code and because of the publication of the Gospel of Judas.
Here’s a rundown on these two texts:
 The Da Vinci Codeuses the Gnostic gospels of Philip and Mary to argue that Jesus
and Mary Magdalene were married and had a child. It’s true that both gospels say
Jesus kissed Mary or loved her more than the other (male) disciples, but it’s only
because she receives and understands Jesus’s special revelation and the other
disciples don’t. It’s difficult to imagine that the kiss between Jesus and Mary was
sexual because the Gnostics considered the material world a corpse and they
were absolutely uninterested in perpetuating it (Gospel of Thomas 56; Gospel of
Mary 4:30–31). It’s more likely that the kiss is a metaphor for the intimate, divine
revelation that passes from Jesus’s lips. To the Gnostics, it’s the wise word — not
the sexual body — that saves (flip to Chapter 10 for more on Mary Magdalene).
 The Gospel of Judas preserves a tradition that Judas was Jesus’s favorite disciple
and that he was the recipient of special revelation. Toward the end of the gospel,
just before Judas turns Jesus over to the authorities, Jesus predicts the event: “But
you [Judas] will exceed all of them [the disciples]. For you will sacrifice the man
that clothes me.” In other words, the canonical gospels condemn Judas for betray-
ing Jesus, but the Gnostic Gospel of Judas praises him for freeing Jesus from his
material body. Is the gospel historical? No. But it is a perfect example of the later
Gnostic teaching that salvation lies beyond the body and this world.

additions. It reworks the canonical texts and so must be later than
them. Plus, it recounts that the cross itself marched out of the tomb
and spoke, which strikes most people as unhistorical — if not down-
right odd. Other apocrypha, such as the Ascents of James, the
Secret Gospel of Mark, and Egerton Papyrus 2 also seem to largely
rework the earlier material in the synoptics (Matthew, Mark, and
Luke) and John. They’re late, they’re dependent on earlier material,
and they demonstrate later historical developments. Three strikes
and they’re out of the running as accurate historical sources.
Seeking Out Early Jewish 
Views of Jesus
Given how many nasty things the gospels say about the Jews 
(did they forget that Jesus was one?), you might expect that the
Jews had some choice words to say back. But in fact, that’s not 
the case, as you find out in the following sections.
The lack of Jewish records may simply be an accident of history, 
or it may suggest that Jesus didn’t make quite the splash that later
Christians imagined he did. But they do provide important back-
ground information on Jewish society at the time of Jesus and in 
the decades just after, as the stories about Jesus were developing.
The Dead Sea Scrolls
From 1947–1955, thousands of fragments of Jewish texts written in
Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek were found in 11 caves along the north-
west corner of the Dead Sea, near a site called Qumran. (Figure 5-1
shows fragments from a Dead Sea Scroll that was found in the fourth
cave at Qumran.) The texts date from about 300 BCE–68 CE, which
means that they overlap with the time when Jesus lived. If Jesus
were as major a figure as the New Testament made him out to be,
you would expect that this huge cache of scrolls (known as the Dead
Sea Scrolls, of course) would preserve some scrap of evidence about
him. But despite many efforts to connect Jesus to the scrolls, 
no connection can really be made.
In fact, the name “Jesus” never even comes up in the texts.
Granted, the community’s leaders and enemies aren’t referred 
to directly either. Instead, these folks are referred to through more
mysterious epithets like “the Teacher of Righteousness” and “the
Wicked Priest.” Several people have tried to argue that these are
veiled references to Jesus or other gospel characters. The major
problem with all these theories, however, is that handwriting 
analysis (called paleography) and carbon-14 tests on the parchment,
Chapter 5: Checking the Sources for Evidence of Jesus 73

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
74
as well as some historical references in the texts themselves, would
place the teacher and the priest a hundred years or so before
Jesus’s birth.
Figure 5-1: A fragment of a Dead Sea Scroll.
Another controversial claim comes from Spanish Jesuit scholar 
José O’Callaghan. He argued that pieces of the Greek New Testament
were found among in the seventh cave at Qumran, but these frag-
ments are so small that each preserves only 9 to 14 clear letters at
most, and no complete words other than the word kai (“and”) are
visible. That’s pretty weak evidence to build on, especially given
that nothing else — graffiti, testimony from people at the time, or
New Testament references — can place Christians at the scroll site.
Does all this evidence mean that the Dead Sea Scrolls are irrelevant
to the study of the historical Jesus? No way! The scrolls may not
give any explicit references to him, but they do give a ton of informa-
tion about Jewish society in his time, such as the different ethical
and ritual practices of various Jewish groups, the formation and
structure of Jewish religious movements, the shape of the scriptures
at the time of Jesus, and the diversity of beliefs about the messiah
and the end-times. And because one of the indisputable things about
the historical Jesus is that he was a Jew, the scrolls give us 
a treasure trove of information that we can use to understand what
his world was like (as you discover in Chapter 7).
The infamous testimony of Josephus
Josephus was a well-educated Jewish man who lived in Roman
Palestine and Rome, just after the lifetime of Jesus (roughly 
© Jeffrey Markowitz/Sygma/Corbis

37–100 CE). He fought against the Romans during the First Jewish
Revolt. When the Romans captured him in 66 CE, however, he allied
himself with them, predicting that the Roman generals Titus and 
his father Vespasian would prevail and become the next emperors 
of Rome. When his prediction came true, they rewarded Josephus
for his accurate prophecy by adopting him, setting him up in a villa
in Rome, and funding his writing projects, which were about the war
and about the antiquities, or history, of the Jewish people. Needless
to say, none of this special Roman treatment endeared him to his
fellow Jews, who ignored his work for centuries.
It was a different story with the Christians, though. They prized
Josephus for his brief references to John the Baptist, James “the
brother of Jesus called Christ,” and Jesus himself. When Josephus
describes Jesus in his writings, he says this:
About this time lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed it is right to call
him a man. For he was a doer of incredible works, a teacher of
people who receive the truth with pleasure, and he won over both
many Jews and many Greeks. He was the Messiah. And when he
heard him accused by the first men among us, Pilate condemned
him to the cross; those who had first loved him did not stop. For
he appeared to them on the third day alive again, because the
divine prophets had spoken these and myriad other wonderful
things about him. To this day the tribe of Christians named after
him has not disappeared.
—Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 18.3.3
Most scholars today are suspicious about this passage because 
it presents as fact some things that only Christians would believe
(underlined above). Because it was Christians who preserved and
copied Josephus’s works, it’s quite likely they added these under-
lined passages to make this Jewish man appear to admit that the
Christians were “right.”
Josephus did write most of the paragraph in the passage, however,
so his testimony from the late first century does actually give some
important historical information: Jesus had a reputation as a teacher
and miracle worker, and he was crucified under Pontius Pilate.
Sifting Through Roman Records
All the gospels agree that the Romans executed Jesus. Did the
Romans themselves record anything about it?
Several first and second century Roman authors mention small
details. For example, around 55 CE the historian Thallos refuted 
the Christian claim that God caused the sky to darken at Jesus’s
Chapter 5: Checking the Sources for Evidence of Jesus 75

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
76
death (see Mark 15:33), reporting that it was merely an eclipse. But
the quote is preserved for us third-hand by a much later author and
tells us more about what Christians were claiming than what Jesus
did. Likewise, in 112 CE the Roman governor of Pontus Bithynia in
modern-day Turkey, Pliny the Younger, mentions that Christians
sang hymns to Christ “as if to a god.” It’s not Roman testimony to
Jesus, but it’s Roman testimony to Christian beliefs about Jesus.
The most important Roman evidence comes from the pen of the
Roman historian Tacitus (c. 56–120? CE). He was a careful scholar,
so his brief reference to the historical Jesus is very important. His
collection of books called The Annals includes the famous story
about the six-day fire (likely set by Emperor Nero himself) that
burned much of Rome in July 64 CE. To put that rumor to rest,
Nero blamed Christians for setting the fire:
Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite punishments
on a class hated for their disgraceful acts, whom the crowd called
Chrestians. The founder of this name, Christ, had been executed in
the reign of Tiberius by the procurator Pontius Pilate. Suppressed
for a time, the deadly superstition erupted again not only in Judea,
the origin of this evil, but also in the city, where all things horrible
and shameful from everywhere come together and become
popular.
—Tacitus, Annals 15.44
Tacitus misspelled Christian in the passage, but he reported that
typo as a mistake of the crowd that he then corrected when he men-
tioned “Christ.” The fact that he calls Jesus “Christ” doesn’t imply
any belief that Jesus is the messiah; it probably just reflects how
Christians were referring to Jesus at that time. His reference that
Jesus was executed doesn’t refer specifically to crucifixion, but the
fact that some Christians were crucified suggests that Nero at least
was aware of the tradition. Finally, Tacitus confirms the canonical
gospel portrait that Pilate executed Jesus as an enemy of Rome;
there’s nothing about any Jewish involvement.
Following the Physical Evidence
As you see from the earlier sections in this chapter, the bulk of the
evidence for the historical Jesus is literary. But it’s common sense
to imagine that there might be some physical evidence as well, and
it’s human nature to want to find some. So, is there any out there?
In short, yes — but as always, it takes a little training to tell the 
difference between authentic and unauthentic evidence.

The legitimate evidence
Archaeological evidence has been discovered that confirms the
existence of some of the places and people mentioned in the gospel
narratives. Here’s some of the most important physical evidence:
 The basalt foundation of a synagogue that dates to the first 
century CE has been unearthed in Capernaum. The gospels
note that Jesus preached in a synagogue in Capernaum 
(Mark 1:21–28; 3:1–6); it might have been this place.
 You can still see the platform and retaining wall of the
Jerusalem Temple where Jesus preached. You can also 
still see the monumental staircase along the southern wall.
 The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem lies in an 
old quarry that was just outside the city walls in Jesus’s time.
Crucifixions took place outside city walls, and early Christians
preserved the memory that this particular quarry was the
place where Jesus died and was buried (see Chapter 20).
 A stone that mentions Pontius Pilate was discovered in 1961 
in Caesarea Maritima, on the coast of Israel. This stone slab is
part of an inscription for a temple that Pilate had apparently
built in honor of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. The inscription
is broken and worn off, but the existing letters read, “[To the
honorab]le [gods] (this) Tiberium [Po]ntius Pilate, [Pref]ect 
of Jud[e]a, [had d]e[dicated].”
 In 1990, a tomb was discovered south of Jerusalem that con-
tained pieces of 12 ossuaries (bone boxes). Ossuary 3 has the
inscription “Qafa” (the Aramaic version of the Greek “Caiaphas”).
Ossuary 6 was more ornate and had two inscriptions mentioning
“Yehosef bar Qayafa,” or Joseph son of Caiaphas. The unusual
name and the quality of the ossuary decoration persuade some
scholars that this tomb belonged to the high priest mentioned 
in Jesus’s trial scene (see Chapter 14).
 In 2007, the location of Herod the Great’s tomb at Herodium
was identified. There’s not much of it left, and no inscription
has yet been found to confirm the identification, but the orna-
mental stone carvings and an ancient description of Herod’s
funeral make the identification likely (see Chapter 7 for more
about this tomb).
The not-so-legitimate evidence
A lot of artifacts and sites out there are neither early nor authentic.
For example, a cave was discovered in 2004 near Jerusalem that
some people claimed was where John the Baptist baptized (see
Chapter 10 for more information). But the graffiti dates from the
Chapter 5: Checking the Sources for Evidence of Jesus 77

Part I: Piecing Together the Jesus Story 
78
Byzantine period, and the location in Jerusalem doesn’t match up
with where the gospels and Josephus say John was working.
Similarly, the bone box of “James, son of Joseph, brother of 
Jesus” came to light in 2002 (see Chapter 9 for details). This finding
appears to be less the product of early piety than of modern inge-
nuity. The box is a legitimate first-century ossuary, but the part of
the inscription that reads “brother of Jesus” appears to be a later
engraving. (The so-called “family tomb of Jesus” promoted in a
2007 television special is likewise more ingenious than genuine.)
There are several reputed relics of Jesus himself that have been cir-
culating for some centuries. Here are a few of these reputed relics:
 The Veronica: “The Veronica” refers to a veil used to wipe 
the suffering Jesus’s face on his way to crucifixion that mirac-
ulously bore the image of his face thereafter. Though this
moment has been memorialized in the devotional Stations of
the Cross, the veil has little historical basis. The fact that the
veil exists in at least four separate locations in Europe doesn’t
help either. (For more on the growth of this and similar 
traditions, see Chapter 17.)
 Fragments of the true cross: When the Emperor Constantine’s
Christian mother, Helena, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem
around 325–327 CE, she allegedly was shown the three crosses
on which Jesus and the two insurgents crucified with him were
hung (Mark 15:27). But which was the cross of Jesus? As the
fourth-century story goes, all three were placed on a dying
woman, and when she was healed, Helena knew where to pull
her souvenir splinters from. Fragments from the “true cross”
have since proliferated so widely that one could likely build
many crosses from all the slivers.
 The Shroud of Turin: This linen cloth bearing the image of 
a crucified man as if in photographic negative first emerged 
in 1357 in Lirey, France. Carbon-14 testing on a scrap of the
shroud in 1988 suggested that it was of medieval manufacture
(1260–1390), but questions were raised in 1993 about whether
the tests had dated the contaminants rather than the linen
itself. There are records from 14th-century France in which the
painter of the shroud confesses he created it. These records
obviously compromise the authenticity of the shroud.
In the end, none of these spurious relics satisfies the criteria 
historians look for. There’s no early testimony about these relics,
and their existence is most easily explained by the natural human
desire to have tangible proof of Jesus.

Reconstructing the
World of Jesus

In this part . . .
A
re you ready to take a trip back in time to the world
of Jesus? In this part, I help you scan the sequence of
empires that had run Jesus’s country for a couple of cen-
turies, especially the newly arrived Roman Empire. I also
give you the lowdown on Jewish society so that you get an
idea of who their leaders were, what they believed, what
religious texts they read, and how they lived. I close out
this part with a chapter on how Rome kept a handle on its
unruly territory and how the Jewish people reacted to the
presence of an occupying empire.

Chapter 6
Introducing the Great and
Powerful Rome
In This Chapter
 Surveying the string of empires in the Near East
 Examining the plots for imperial Roman power
 Introducing the Romans from the gospels
Jesus was born into the Roman Empire, and his history can’t be
told apart from it. This isn’t only because Rome controlled
Jesus’s homeland (Palestine), picked its high priests, and ultimately
executed Jesus. It’s also because Rome’s propaganda and promises
of peace and prosperity shaped the role of Jesus during his life and
the memory of him after his death. Just before Jesus’s birth, the
Romans had begun to make their emperors gods and to promote the
empire as the source of order, peace, and a better life. The gospel
authors had a different vision. For them, only God could offer true
justice and peace, and only Jesus could bring that to this world.
In this chapter, you survey the empires that ruled Palestine,
uncover why Rome valued the region, follow the rise of the Roman
Empire, and meet the Romans mentioned in the gospels.
Witnessing a Succession 
of Empires before Rome
The Romans weren’t the first empire to conquer Judea, Samaria,
and the Galilee — the region where Jesus lived. In fact, the Jewish
people in those regions had endured more than 500 years of impe-
rial control almost without interruption before the first Roman
legions came even close to the Near East. The area was strategi-
cally significant to all these empires; it gave them access to the

82

great civilizations to the east (Mesopotamia and Persia) and the
south (Egypt). Meanwhile, for the locals, the experience of foreign
rule and the memory of political independence stoked their hope
that God would one day restore their autonomy. Many would view
Jesus as the agent of that divine intervention.
The Assyrian Empire
The first invasion of the region occurred in 722 BCE. The Assyrian
Empire, based in modern-day northern Iraq, had set its sights on
the fertile Nile River delta in Egypt. However, two Israelite king-
doms, Israel and Judah, were in the way of its takeover. So, of
course, Assyria went after them both. The northern kingdom of
Israel resisted Assyria and was completely destroyed. The south-
ern kingdom of Judah, on the other hand, allied itself with Assyria.
For their efforts, the kingdom of Judah was forced to become a
vassal state (basically this meant that they had to do what Assyria
wanted and pay them a lot of annual tribute money for the “privi-
lege” of protection). That assured their survival for the time being.
The Neo-Babylonian Empire
After the Assyrians, the Neo-Babylonian Empire in southern Iraq
rolled through the region (626–539 BCE). There had been several
powerful Babylonian dynasties in the past, but none had been as
ambitious as this one. Like Assyria, it too had its eyes set on Egypt.
The Egyptian Pharaoh Neco II didn’t waver; he marched right out
to stop the Babylonians. The Judean King Josiah got in the
Pharaoh’s way at Megiddo and was killed, either because he was
siding with Babylon or because Neco couldn’t trust his loyalty 
(2 Kings 23:29–30, 2 Chronicles 35:20–25). Either way, Josiah’s 
successor, Jehoakim, took the hint and sided with Egypt.
At first, it looked like the right move: The Babylonians tried to
attack Egypt and failed, retreating back to Babylon to lick their
wounds. But when the Babylonians returned in 597 BCE, they got
their revenge. They besieged Jerusalem and forced it to pay trib-
ute. Ten years later, in 587 BCE, they destroyed the city, razed its
Temple to the ground, and exiled the Jerusalem elite to Babylon.
The Persian Empire
The Neo-Babylonian Empire in modern-day Iraq was soon displaced
by the Persian Empire of modern-day Iran. The Persian king Cyrus
and his Achaemenid dynasty had a more lenient and pragmatic view

Chapter 6: Introducing the Great and Powerful Rome 83
of the conquered peoples, however. They let all exiles return to their
homelands and even subsidized their rebuilding efforts. But, of
course, Cyrus’s reasoning wasn’t to be Mr. Nice Guy. No, he was
being lenient on the principle that he could squeeze more out of the
exiles if they were prosperous. Some of the Jewish elite returned to
Judah and began re-creating their traditions and scriptures.
Alexander the Great
Alexander the Great of Greece managed to defeat the Persians in
331 BCE and take over their holdings, establishing the Hellenistic
Empire. (Hellene is the Greek word for “Greeks.”). Alexander was
fond of drinking, which may have led to his early death at age 33 
(it was either that or a virus, which isn’t nearly as sensational).
After his death, his empire eventually broke into three parts, with
centers in Greece as well as in the strategic cities of Alexandria in
Egypt (controlling the Nile River basin) and Antioch in Syria (con-
trolling access from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia). The Greek
center was ruled by Antigonus, the Egyptian center by Ptolemy, and
the Syrian by Seleucus. The people in Judah and the Galilee fell first
under the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt, and then under the Seleucid
kingdom of Antioch. It was under these Hellenistic kingdoms that
the Hebrew name for Judah became Judea, the Greek spelling.
The Jews broke free of Seleucid control for about 100 years (from
164–63 BCE) and were ruled by a native Jewish dynasty, the
Hasmoneans. But the ties between the Seleucid kingdom and the
Hasmonean kingdom weren’t completely severed. The Jewish kings
and queens, ruling from Jerusalem, were always forming alliances
with one empire or another for political, military, diplomatic, and
economic reasons (flip to Chapter 7 for more information). They
should have been forging alliances with each other, however,
because it was a civil war between warring branches of the family
that paved the way for Rome’s entrance into the region.
The Romans Are Coming! 
The Romans Are Coming!
With the Seleucid Empire weak and the Jewish Hasmonean king-
dom split by civil war, the next empire to take over the region was
the Roman Empire. (Technically, Rome wasn’t an empire at all
when its legions first entered Jerusalem. It was still a republic,
meaning that an elite group of leading men representing all of
Rome made political decisions rather than a single dictator.)

Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
84
By 100 BCE, Rome’s army controlled most of Spain, southern
France, all of Italy and Greece, the west coast of Turkey and a por-
tion of its southern coast, as well the tip of Africa closest to Sicily.
But Rome’s sights were set on bigger prizes in all directions, and
the ambitions of its leading men to expand Rome’s territory made
the concentration of power in fewer hands that much more attrac-
tive. For Judea and the Galilee, this would mean not only that they
would fall into Roman hands, but also that they would be governed
from a distance by an emperor with unparalleled power.
Entering Jerusalem with Pompey
Even though the Romans controlled most of the northern coast of
the Mediterranean Sea, they wanted to control more. Why? Well, for
starters, Rome had a lot of hungry mouths to feed (Rome wasn’t a
small city!), and assuring an adequate grain supply required control
of a more fertile region than Rome currently had access to. Like
Assyria and Babylon before it (see the earlier section on previous
empires ruling the Near East), Rome was drawn to the eastern
Mediterranean and Egypt, where the ancient river valleys enabled
the production of a steady supply of food. Trouble was, pirates con-
trolled the seas and foreign kings controlled the land.
The fact that Rome had scads of ambitious young men seeking to
advance their fortunes and careers through military exploits also
explains the Roman thirst for expansion. In 67 BCE, for instance, a
39-year-old general named Pompey was sent to subdue the pirates in
the eastern Mediterranean. Almost single-handedly, he was respon-
sible for bringing the Near East into the Roman orbit, and his politi-
cal ascendancy set the stage for the rise of the Roman emperors.
Pompey enjoyed a reputation as a successful general. But this
gleaming reputation was built to some extent on being in the right
place at the right time. For example, in 71 BCE, Pompey slaugh-
tered the last of the rebels in Spartacus’s celebrated slave revolt
(remember the film?) and took all the credit even though a compa-
triot had really done all the dirty work.
After a term as consul in Rome (71–70 BCE), Pompey was eager to
demonstrate that he deserved an even greater reputation. The
pirate problem mentioned earlier in the section gave him that
opportunity, and he took the following trek:
 With 500 ships and a 120,000-man infantry, Pompey cleared
the sea of pirates within three months (67–66 BCE).

 After being rewarded by the Roman Senate with greater
power, he proceeded to Asia Minor, where he took credit for
the final defeat of the King of Pontus, who had been severely
weakened by Pompey’s predecessor, Lucullus (65–63 BCE).
 He turned south to the weakened Seleucid Empire in Antioch,
which he promptly claimed as a province of Rome (64 BCE).
 After taking over Antioch, the small Hasmonean kingdom of
Judea hardly presented Pompey a challenge. It was split by civil
war, with one brother (Aristobulus II) holed up in Jerusalem and
the other brother (Hyrcanus II) seeking Pompey’s help. Pompey
sided with Hyrcanus. The capital city of Jerusalem held out for
three months, but Pompey eventually penetrated its walls and
marched right into the Holy of Holies in the Jerusalem Temple
(the Holy of Holies was the central part of the Temple where
only the high priest was allowed). At this point, the conquest of
Jerusalem was complete. Hyrcanus II was allowed to remain the
high priest and was later given the political role of ethnarch
(which means “ruler of the people”), but the Romans never
allowed him to be a king. Rome was making the rules now.
The impact of Pompey’s sweep of the eastern Mediterranean was
felt for centuries. Being the administrative genius that he was, he
established a system of governance and tax collection that left local
elites in charge where possible, thus sparing Rome the responsibil-
ity of direct supervision (except, of course, in its prized imperial
provinces). Rome got money, land, grain and other goods, slaves,
and the security of buffer states on its frontiers. Jesus was born in
one of these Roman buffer states. Subject to Roman administration
and taxes, his message of another kind of kingdom resonated with
people chafing under the rule of Rome and its local allies.
Seizing imperial control 
with Julius Caesar
The Roman Senate was nervous about the growing power of men
like Pompey. The senators tried to undercut the power of three
important leaders by stalling on veterans’ benefits for their soldiers
and the like, but the remedy backfired. The Senate’s attack drove
the three rivals together. Pompey and two other great generals,
Crassus and Julius Caesar, secretly formed an unofficial triumvirate
(a political regime that’s ruled by three powerful people) that took
effective control of the government in 60 BCE. The days of the
Roman republic were numbered; some would say it ended that year.
Chapter 6: Introducing the Great and Powerful Rome 85

Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
86
All three members of the First Triumvirate had high ambitions, but
in the end it was Caesar who won out. Crassus was killed battling
the Parthians in the east in 53 BCE. In 49 BCE, Caesar returned
from the Gallic Wars and crossed the Rubicon River in northeast-
ern Italy to have an all-out civil war with Pompey for control of the
empire. Caesar chased Pompey first to Greece and then to Egypt,
where in 48 BCE an assassin ended Pompey’s life. At that time,
Caesar returned to Rome as Imperator, which meant that he was
the supreme and unparalleled commander of Rome.
Caesar, like Pompey before him, was an able administrator. He 
consolidated Roman control by creating colonies of retired veter-
ans and poor civilians who extended Roman practices into the
provinces, including the Near East. Caesar worked to reduce the
debts and eliminate the interest payments of Roman citizens. He
even held spectacular festivals and games for their entertainment.
In the east, the Hasmonean ethnarch Hyrcanus II had supported
Caesar and was rewarded with privileges like the control of
Jerusalem and certain tax breaks and religious privileges. But he
and all the other petty kings were really riding a political roller
coaster during those years as they tried to pick the winning side.
Caesar’s authority didn’t last long, however. He set his sights on
expanding the empire eastward into the regions that were once con-
trolled by Alexander the Great but were now controlled by the
Parthians (in modern-day Iran). In 44 BCE, just three days before he
was due to set sail, 60 conspirators surrounded Caesar at a meeting
and stabbed him to death. (Yes, just like in Shakespeare’s play!)
Consolidating the empire 
with Octavian
Where Julius Caesar failed, his adopted nephew, Octavian, suc-
ceeded. He stepped into the political vacuum created by Caesar’s
death, building his power slowly and ruthlessly and then managing
his imperial role with much greater sensitivity to Rome’s traditions
of shared governance. As a result, he remained on the imperial
throne much longer; he was emperor when Jesus was born. He
approved the takeover of Judea when it became a Roman province
in 6 CE, which meant that there would be a Roman prefect in charge
of Jerusalem 25 years later when Jesus was arrested and tried.
Octavian’s rise to power in the Second Triumvirate
In 43 BCE, Octavian, Caesar’s right-hand man, Mark Antony, and
another general by the name of Lepidus collaborated to create the
Second Triumvirate. This triumvirate, unlike the first, was author-
ized by the Senate. Power over the empire was largely divided

between Octavian and Antony, who cemented their alliance when
Antony married Octavian’s sister, Octavia, in 40 BCE. Lepidus got
Spain and Africa, but in 36 BCE Octavian accused him of attempted
rebellion and forced him into exile. Like an episode of Survivor, it
was down to two men.
The alliance soon fell apart, partly because of the men’s competing
ambitions in the Near East and also because of Antony’s competing
love interest with the last Ptolemy in Egypt, Cleopatra VII. Octavia
was humiliated, and their marriage ended in 32 BCE. Because
Octavian wanted to avenge his sister and secure control of Egypt
and the east, he declared war on Cleopatra. In 31 BCE, he defeated
Antony and Cleopatra at the naval Battle of Actium in northwestern
Greece. The two lovers escaped to Alexandria, where they commit-
ted suicide. Octavian then declared Egypt an imperial province, and
began to consolidate his power as the unrivaled ruler of the entire
empire (see a map of the Roman Empire in Figure 6-1).
Figure 6-1: The Roman Empire in 30 BCE.
Octavian’s governance of the Roman Empire
As ruler, Octavian established a new form of Roman government, a
principate in which he was the “first man.” A principate is basically
a government in which one citizen was understood to be first 
(princeps) among all the others. Octavian understood, as his uncle
Julius Caesar had not, that the republican form of government was
traditional and revered and couldn’t be easily discarded. So far in
the Roman republic, elites had governed through institutions such
as the Senate and free elections. The power-hungry Octavian

couldn’t allow that kind of control, but neither could he risk eradi-
cating it and alienating the aristocracy. So he set out on a careful
(and crafty!) campaign to increase his power while appearing to
restore republican institutions and conservative, family values.
In 27 BCE, Octavian accepted the title “Augustus,” which was a tra-
ditional term with religious overtones that established his preemi-
nence. Through coins and statues, as well as temples and festivals
in the provinces (though not in Rome), Augustus cultivated the
notion that he — along with the gods — was responsible for the
blessings that people enjoyed. It’s no accident that the New
Testament authors portrayed Jesus in a similar way. They didn’t
call him “Augustus,” but they spoke of natural signs that accompa-
nied his birth (like Matthew’s star in 2:2), and some presented him
as a kind of cosmic ruler responsible for the creation and restora-
tion of the world (Philippians 2:5–11; John 1:1–5; Revelation 21:1–8).
Augustus also established an effective system to administer his
empire. He divided the provinces into the following two types:
 Imperial provinces: These key regions were governed by
legates (Roman military officers from the senatorial class who
controlled legions, army units of 5,000 to 6,000 men) who were
appointed directly by Augustus. Egypt and Syria, because of
their strategic significance, were two such imperial provinces.
(Egypt produced a great deal of grain that Rome needed and
controlled sea trade to Arabia and India. Syria controlled the
land route to Mesopotamia and the Far East.) When Rome
took over direct control of Judea/Samaria in 6 CE, regions
were absorbed into the imperial province of Syria but were
given their own local governor, the Roman prefect.
 Public (or senatorial) provinces: These provinces were of
somewhat lesser importance. They fell under the authority of
the republican institution (the Senate). The more significant
provinces were assigned to proconsuls (former consuls in
Rome — the highest appointed office in the Empire — who
then were sent out to govern provinces). Public provinces in
the Near East during Jesus’s lifetime included Macedonia and
Cyprus.
Many parts of the Augustan empire fell under the umbrella of the
imperial provinces but were allowed to retain their local rulers. In
this case, those rulers became client kings of Rome. They enjoyed
some measure of autonomy as long as they did Rome’s bidding and
kept the peace. But if they were incompetent, Rome would step in
to assume direct control. (This happened in the Jewish kingdom
after Herod the Great died in 4 BCE; see Chapter 8 for more info.)
Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
88

The death of a ruler: Transitioning to Tiberius
Augustus died in 14 CE from a brief illness; one biographer said
that it was some sort of bowel ailment. Before he died, he had des-
ignated his stepson Tiberius to succeed him. Tiberius held the
office until his own death in 37 CE. While there were intrigues in
the capital city of Rome involving the elimination of his relatives
and rivals, Tiberius managed most provinces well, including Judea.
Meeting the Romans Mentioned 
in the Gospels
All of the gospel writers mentioned the Romans during the trial
and execution of Jesus (which was pretty unavoidable considering
the Romans were responsible for it). But Luke also started his
story with a reference to Rome. In the following sections, I intro-
duce a few Romans who appear in the gospels.
Augustus
Augustus, the emperor of Rome from 31 BCE to 14 CE, appears
early on in Luke’s narrative of Jesus’s infancy. In his story, he said
Augustus decreed that “the whole world should be enrolled” for
tax purposes (Luke 2:1). What Luke meant by “enrolled” was that a
census had to be taken so that Rome would know just how many
heads to tax. In Luke’s view, every man had to travel to his ances-
tral home, so that’s why Joseph and Mary traveled from Nazareth
in the north to Bethlehem in the south, the ancestral home of
Joseph’s Davidic clan, where Jesus was subsequently born.
There are some historical problems with this census:
 There’s no record that Augustus ever ordered an empire-wide
enrollment.
 There was no need for a census at that time because Judea
and the Galilee weren’t Roman provinces.
 There was no precedent for enrolling outside the place that
people actually lived and no rule that the entire family had to
go along for the ride.
Luke was wrong on the details but keen on his main point: The
infant about to be born in a provincial backwater would rival the
emperor in offering true salvation and peace.
Chapter 6: Introducing the Great and Powerful Rome 89

Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
90
Quirinius
In his infancy narrative (Luke 2:2), Luke mentioned Quirinius, the
provincial governor of Syria. Luke said that Jesus was born during
Quirinius’s rule. This declaration presents a historical problem:
Quirinius was the imperial legate in Syria from 6–9 CE, but both
Luke and Matthew say that Jesus was born while Herod the Great
was still king — and Herod died in 4 BCE. Both of these claims
can’t be right! But you don’t want to miss the forest for the trees.
The purpose of Luke’s setup, even if his historical details are
wrong, is to contrast the kingdoms of Jesus and Rome. Luke used
Rome as a backdrop so that Jesus’s significance as the true ruler,
the true source of salvation, would stand out clearly. Rome prom-
ised these things, but in Luke’s view, only Jesus delivered them.
Tiberius
Luke discussed Augustus’s successor, the Emperor Tiberius, when
he shifted from the infancy narrative to the account of Jesus’s
adult life. In Chapter 3 of his gospel, Luke introduced John the
Baptist, who introduced Jesus. Here’s how Luke presented John:
In the fifteenth year of the rule of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius
Pilate was prefect of Judea and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee,
and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and
Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, during the
high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to
John, son of Zechariah, in the desert.
—Luke 3:1–2
Luke’s list moves down the imperial hierarchy from the emperor to
the local Roman governor to the local client kings and finally to the
Jewish high priests selected by Rome. Luke’s historical setting isn’t
innocent, but instead makes a point. As with Augustus earlier in
this chapter, Luke was saying that Jesus would compete with these
characters as a new kind of ruler, and John would be his herald.
Pontius Pilate and the missus
All four of the gospels recount stories of Pontius Pilate, the 
Roman prefect of Judea who presided over Jesus’s trial and 
execution (Matthew 27:1–2, 11–31; Mark 15–20; Luke 23:1–25; 
John 18:28–19:16). In Matthew’s gospel, Pilate’s wife also makes a
brief cameo appearance (Matthew 27:19) — a story that expands
dramatically in later legends (you can read more about the Pilates
in Chapter 14).

Roman soldiers
Roman soldiers make occasional appearances in the gospels. The
largest cohort is in Jerusalem when Jesus is arrested, tried, and
executed. They flog him, mock him, take him out to the crucifixion
site, and crucify him (Matthew 27:1–28:15; Mark 15; Luke 23; John
18:28–19:42). In Matthew’s gospel, the Roman soldiers also post a
guard outside Jesus’s tomb to prevent the disciples from stealing
the body (Matthew 27:62–66; 28:11–15). Find out more about the
crucifixion in Chapter 14.
A few solitary Roman soldiers pop up in more positive contexts:
 The legionaries who go to John for baptism (Luke 3:14)
 The centurion (the commanding officer of a century, which is
a unit of 100 soldiers) who asked Jesus to cure his slave
(Matthew 8:5–13; Luke 7:1–10)
 The centurion at the foot of the cross who testified that
“Truly, this man was a son of God” (Mark 15:39; Matthew
27:54)

O
ne of the things we know about Jesus was that he was a Jew.
But what did it mean to be a Jew in his time? Whatever you
know about Jews today, you can’t assume that’s what they were
like back in the day. Two thousand years have gone by, and groups
change a lot over such a long period (not to mention that the early
Jews were a pretty diverse lot to begin with!).
This chapter is a trip back in time. It gives you the chance to go to
Judea between about 200 BCE and 30 CE and meet the people and
see how they lived. You discover how they ran their government,
you uncover their basic religious beliefs, you join their major reli-
gious groups, and you meet their families.
Hoping for Their Own Kind of King
Before Jesus was crucified with the charge “King of the Jews” over
his head, several different kingdoms ruled the Jews of the Near
East. The way they ruled shaped how the people thought about
kings and kindled the Jewish hope that one day a king of their own,
or some sort of heaven-sent person, would repel the foreign rulers
and restore the Jewish nation, Temple, and society. This hope took
many forms and shaped how the historical Jesus was viewed by
some of his contemporaries. You can check out Chapter 6 for a
quick introduction to the history of these empires and their con-
quests (including the Roman Empire). What I focus on here is the
cultural impact they had on Jewish society.

Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
94
Falling to foreign kings and cultures
The Jews hadn’t had their own native king since 587 BCE, when the
Neo-Babylonian Empire blew through the Jewish kingdom of Judah
(which later became Judea) and marched the monarch Zedekiah
off into exile, executing his sons along the way (2 Kings 24:6–7;
Jeremiah 52:9–11). The northern part of the country, Israel, lost its
independence even earlier, when it was overrun by the Assyrian
Empire in 721 BCE. Remnants of the Davidic dynasty (the family
that had ruled the kingdom of Judah since about 1000 BCE) sur-
vived, but barely. When the Persians sent the Babylonians packing
and allowed the Judeans to return to their province, they picked
the old king’s grandson, Zerubbabel, as governor. But that’s all that
Zerubbabel could be — governor. The Persians wouldn’t allow the
“stump” of the Davidic line to sprout kings anymore. (This phrase,
the “stump” or root of the Davidic line that starts from David’s
father, Jesse, was an important text for later messianic thought;
see Isaiah 11:1–10; Acts 13:22–23; Revelation 22:16).
In the 330s BCE, the Persian Empire fell to Alexander the Great, and
when Alexander died in 323 BCE, his Hellenistic empire split into
three parts; Judea was firmly in the Egyptian orbit, and a Syrian
branch set up shop just to the north. The impact of the imperial
shift from Persia to Greek Egypt was pretty negligible for the little
province of Judea, at least as far as politics was concerned. The
Greeks kept the Persian system largely intact. In fact, subject nations
like Judea actually had some autonomy. Their priests ran the
Jerusalem Temple and their wealthy families collected taxes (and
kept hefty profits). But ultimately even the elites were under the
thumb of Greek bureaucrats and had every incentive to mimic them
(by learning Greek, studying Plato, and so on). Doing so allowed
them to rise up the political ranks and be on the social cutting edge.
Switching to the Seleucids
The two Greek dynasties on either side of Judea, the Ptolemies and
the Seleucids, spent the third century BCE battling for control of
the Palestinian coast. In 200 BCE, power officially shifted to the
north when the Ptolemies of Egypt lost Judea to the Seleucids of
Syria.
The Seleucids were a little more interested in cultural uniformity
than their predecessors. So, of course, they didn’t want the Jews to
keep observing their religious and cultural practices. Instead, the
Seleucids wanted to replace those customs with Greek traditions,
cultural institutions (like gymnasiums and theaters), and religious
practices (like the worship of the Greek gods). The problem was
that not all of their subjects in the provinces were sold on the idea.

Chapter 7: Taking a Snapshot of Jewish Society in Jesus’s Time 95
The issue came to a head in 168 BCE. The Seleucid King Antiochus
IV, a usurper to the throne who liked to call himself Epiphanes
(“manifest” [as a God]), was humiliated by a Roman delegation in
Egypt and forced to withdraw to Syria. He took his revenge by sav-
agely reasserting control over his Jewish subjects on his way
home. Antiochus plundered the Jerusalem Temple, brutalized the
population, forbade religious traditions (such as Sabbaths and 
circumcision), and tried to compel sacrifice to the Greek gods. He
even rededicated the Temple to Zeus Olympios-Ba’al Shamim
(“Zeus of Olympus, Lord of the Heavens”). There’s a reason the
Greek author Polybius called Antiochus Epimanes (“madman”).
Ruling with the Hasmoneans
Some of the Jews revolted against the Seleucids in 168 BCE. 
It isn’t clear exactly who started the revolt, but one family — 
the Hasmoneans — soon came to dominate it. Mattathias the
Hasmonean and his five sons, especially Judah Maccabee (“Judah
the Hammer”), used guerrilla tactics and eventually retook
Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple. This eight-day rededication
later became the basis for the festival of Hanukkah (1 Maccabees
4:36–59; 2 Maccabees 1:18–2:23).
The irony with the Hasmoneans was that they were pretty Hellenized
themselves, having been one of the prominent families in Judea
under the Seleucids. They spoke Greek, knew how to handle them-
selves in imperial courts, and adopted a lot of Greek practices.
Judean independence wasn’t assured until about 141 BCE, when
both the Seleucids and the Romans recognized Judea’s autonomy.
But Judea’s independence remained on shaky ground later as well.
After all, the only reason that the Seleucids recognized Judea’s
autonomy is that they were consumed with a century-long fight in
Antioch (the capital of the Greek empire in Syria) over the dynastic
succession after the usurper Antiochus IV died in 164 BCE. The
would-be rulers were too busy fighting among themselves to retake
Judea. The Romans were just a century away from taking advantage
of that weakness themselves; in 64 BCE, the Roman general Pompey
seized Antioch and the Seleucid Empire for Rome (see Chapter 6).
The Hasmoneans enjoyed about a century of relative independ-
ence, even though their reign was controversial. They seized the
high priesthood on the grounds that they were from the priestly
tribe of Levi. This seizure caused a lot of concern among the
Judean people because the Hasmoneans weren’t descended from
the Zadokite line, the legitimate line for the high priests. The
Hasmoneans also seized the Judean throne, even though they
weren’t from the Davidic line.

Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
96
In the following sections, I go over the main events of the rule of
the Hasmoneans: the expansion of territory and a brutal civil war.
Expanding the kingdom
After gaining independence, the Hasmoneans weren’t content to
control only tiny Judea. They began to expand their territory,
taking advantage of Seleucid weakness. From 130–100 BCE, they
conquered the following groups:
 The Idumeans south of Bethlehem
 The Greeks in cities along the coast and in the Decapolis 
(ten independent cities/colonies built by the Greeks on the
east side of the Jordan River just north of Judea)
 The Samaritans to the immediate north
 The Greeks, Syrians, and Arab Itureans in the distant northern
districts of the Galilee and the Golan Heights
The people in the annexed regions who weren’t already Jews were
told to convert to Judaism — or else. All that conquest meant a lot
of new tax money for the Jerusalem Temple, its priests, and Judea
in general. That new tax money in turn attracted a wave of migra-
tion to the region from the conquered territories — and a lot of
resentment from Jews and the new forced converts elsewhere.
Engaging in civil war
The newfound wealth of Judea made the throne that much more
attractive. When the Hasmonean Queen Salome Alexandra died in
67 BCE, her two sons threw the country into civil war as they
fought over the succession. Ironically, the Hasmonean dynasty
would die in this dynastic succession, just as it had survived all
those years because of Seleucid battles over the dynastic succes-
sion in Antioch. Who fought against whom in this civil war?
 On one side was King Hyrcanus II, with his allies the Idumaean
Antipater and his son, Herod (known to posterity as “Herod the
Great”; see the following section), as well as King Aretas, who
ruled the Nabatean kingdom (an Arab kingdom that reached
from southern Syria to eastern Egypt and northwest Arabia). By
64 BCE, fresh off his victories in Asia Minor and Syria, the
Roman general Pompey joined Hyrcanus and his group
(Chapter 6 covers Rome’s entry into the Palestinian picture).
 On the other side was King Aristobulus II, his son Antigonus,
his friends in Lebanon (northwest of Judea), and some other
assorted generals. In 49 BCE, he won over another important
ally in Julius Caesar, when Caesar was trying to wrest power
from Pompey (Chapter 6 explains the mess going on in Roman
politics at this time).

As the Roman republic slipped into chaos, the Hasmonean civil
war only got worse. As if that weren’t enough, the Parthian Empire
of modern Iran and Iraq, which was worried about Rome’s
approach, intervened in support of Aristobulus and banished
Hyrcanus to Babylon. Hyrcanus’s ally, the young Idumean Herod,
fled to Rome, where he was declared king by the Senate and was
told to conquer the Hasmonean kingdom and destroy their alliance
with the Parthians. He accomplished this task in 37 BCE.
Living in the time of Herod the Great
When he fled to Rome, Herod the Great played his cards correctly
and at just the right the moment. At the time, Roman imperial
power in the eastern Mediterranean was coming together. He had
chosen the winning side. He was sent back to his home turf to
battle the Parthians, where his combination of ruthless behavior
and pragmatic, even imperial, vision allowed him to gain control of
the former Hasmonean Empire. The region, which the Romans
later referred to as Palestine (after its coastal inhabitants, the
Philistines), began to enjoy a period of relative prosperity and
growth. Herod’s 33-year reign was in many ways a welcome respite
for the Jewish people from 30 years of civil war, though it too was
marked by violence (including against his own family).
A bad guy to his family
To avenge Herod’s earlier exile by the ruling Hasmoneans and to
destroy their alliance with the Parthian Empire as the Roman
Senate had authorized him to do, Herod’s army besieged Jerusalem
in 37 BCE and slaughtered many of its Jewish inhabitants. Herod
intervened to stop his Idumean troops from more killing, but then
he shipped the Parthians’ pick for Hasmonean king off to the
Romans to be executed. The days of Parthian influence were over.
Under Herod, the region was securely in Rome’s orbit.
Wanting to smooth things over with the Hasmoneans after effec-
tively executing their king, Herod dumped his wife, Doris, and mar-
ried a young Hasmonean princess named Mariamne. Because he
couldn’t become high priest (he wasn’t from the right clan and his
father was a convert), Herod took over the right to appoint the
person who would become the high priest and picked Mariamne’s
brother. But when some people sought to crown her brother king,
he died in Herod’s palace in a not-so-mysterious drowning accident.
Herod proceeded to execute Mariamne her mother shortly there-
after. Then he killed another brother-in-law, two of his sons by
Mariamne, and his son by Doris. Fortunately, he’d had enough mar-
riages (ten in all) to produce a few other heirs who survived him 
(for a partial family tree, see Chapter 10). The executions reflected
Chapter 7: Taking a Snapshot of Jewish Society in Jesus’s Time 97

Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus

his insecurity about his position. A lot of Jews were upset that they
were ruled by a second-generation convert, a man who had defeated
the legitimate Hasmonean dynasty and allied himself with Roman
power and Hellenistic practices. They looked for opportunities to
undermine him, and with all those Herodian children as potential
replacements, there was plenty of room for Herod to be paranoid.
Given all this bloodshed, Herod’s reputation was such that the
gospel of Matthew would remember him as a murderer of children,
as vicious as the hated Pharaoh of Egypt (Matthew 2; Exodus
1:1–2:11). There’s even a story that Emperor Augustus quipped,
“I’d rather be Herod’s pig than his son” (in Greek, the words “pig”
and “son” sound similar). Even though the Emperor probably
never said this, it’s still funny: The pig was safer because Jews
don’t eat pork!
A patron for the Jewish people
Herod was fortunately a lot nicer to the Jewish people than he was
to his own family. It was no joke that he was remembered as Herod
the Great. He took advantage of the expanded Hasmonean kingdom
and his own successful alliance with the Roman Empire to build up
the region and strengthen the position of Jews throughout the
Diaspora or dispersion (the many places where Jews had relocated).
Herod built several fortresses and palaces for himself, but a lot of
the investment was in roads and public buildings modeled on Greco-
Roman architecture, such as stadiums and gymnasiums. Some other
examples of Herod’s building work include the following:
 Keen to honor Emperor Augustus at every possible turn, he cre-
ated a modern port city on the northern Samarian coast along
the Mediterranean Sea and christened it “Caesarea Maritima”
(or “city of Caesar by the sea”) in honor of the emperor, thus
shifting trade from ports in Lebanon southward — and to a
lesser degree from Alexandria northward. The city was so nice
and had so many Roman-style institutions and buildings that
later Roman governors made it their capital.
 He rebuilt the city of Samaria north of Judea and named it
Sebaste in honor of the Emperor (Sebaste is Greek for Augustus,
an honorific title that means “revered” or “honorable”).
 He enlarged the hill on which the Jerusalem Temple stood by
building a massive retaining wall. This wall increased the size
and capacity of the site so enormously that Jerusalem became
a major tourist hub and pilgrimage center for Jews throughout
the Mediterranean (see Figure 7-1). The western part of that
wall — the so-called “Western Wall” or “Wailing Wall” — is still
a pilgrimage destination for Jews (see Chapter 20).

Figure 7-1: Herod the Great’s renovations of the Jerusalem Temple, 30 CE.
While building up his kingdom, Herod also worked his Roman con-
nections to protect Jews living in other parts of the Roman Empire.
He made generous gifts to Greek and Roman cities for their own
public buildings and games. By doing this, he bought good will for
the Jews living in those areas. He even subsidized the Olympic
Games in 12 BCE, which earned him acclaim throughout the empire.
Herod the Great died an agonizing death in 4 BCE. The Jewish his-
torian Josephus, who apparently wasn’t Herod’s biggest fan, rev-
eled in the gory details. He said that Herod suffered from ulcerated
intestines, some sort of chronic urinary discharge, “putrefied

Unearthing the tomb of Herod
In May 2007, Israeli archaeologist Ehud Netzer announced that he had discovered
the tomb of King Herod the Great at Herodium, one of Herod’s fortified palaces, just
8 miles south of Jerusalem. Netzer had been excavating the site for 35 years before
he discovered a platform and remnants of a shattered and elaborately decorated
sarcophagus along the monumental staircase up the slope. He didn’t find an inscrip-
tion mentioning Herod’s name, but the site is widely considered to be the most likely
place for Herod’s tomb. After all, Herod named the place for himself, and the first-
century Jewish historian Josephus reported that Herod’s body was carried in an
elaborate funeral procession from Jericho, where he died, to Herodium for burial
(Jewish Antiquities 17.8.3). The hilltop fortress ceased to be used as a palace after
Herod’s death and was briefly occupied by the Jewish rebels during the First Revolt
against Rome (66–74 CE). It was most likely these rebels who smashed up the 
tomb — so great was their hatred for the infamous client king of Rome.

genitals” that produced worms, and difficulty breathing (Jewish
Antiquities 17.6.5). A nasty end for a nasty man, Josephus would
say (see the nearby sidebar “Unearthing the tomb of Herod” for
more about a recent archeological discovery).
It’s hard to be certain, but Jesus was likely born sometime before
Herod the Great’s death. Both Matthew and Luke mention that this
Herod was king when Jesus was born (Matthew 2; Luke 1:5; see
Chapter 9 for some of the historical problems with these accounts).
Carving up the kingdom
After Herod’s death, his kingdom broke into three parts, with each
part going to a different son. Here’s what the division looked like:
 Herod Antipas took the northwestern portion, which included
the northern region of the Galilee, as well as Perea on the east
bank of the Jordan River.
 Herod Archelaus took the all-important region of Judea, with
its Temple-city of Jerusalem. He also took Samaria with its
port at Caesarea Maritima and the family’s homeland, Idumea.
 Their half-brother Philip became tetrarch (ruler of four major
regions) of the northeast (two of which were the Iturea and
Trachonitis mentioned as his territories in Luke 3:1).
Herod Antipas and Philip reigned until well into the 30s CE. Herod
Archelaus wasn’t so lucky — or so skillful. He immediately alienated
the Judean Jews. As the story goes, the Jews were upset that Herod
senior (Herod the Great) had put a golden Roman eagle on the
Jewish Temple. They saw the eagle as a pagan symbol and as an
insult to God. So, a few Jews defaced the eagle, and then Herod
killed them. When Jewish partisans wanted to honor the memory of
these martyrs, Archelaus murdered them. Nice way to start a reign!
It turned out that Archelaus was more concerned about the poten-
tial insult to Rome than he was about the insult to his own people.
The situation only went downhill from there, and within nine years,
Rome had exiled Archelaus to Gaul and seized Judea and Samaria
as a Roman province. This explains why the Romans were the ones
in charge some 25 years later, when Jesus was killed in Jerusalem.
Believing in God, Temple, 
and Torah
Many first-century Jews shared certain general ideas, even if their
specific beliefs about those ideas differed from group to group and

place to place (I discuss different Jewish groups later in this chap-
ter). The basic ideas that all these folks shared were
 There’s only one God.
 There’s only one Temple.
 The Torah is the cornerstone of Jewish scripture and ethics.
The historical Jesus, who was a first-century Jew, shared these
core convictions. He believed in only one God, he worshipped at
the Jerusalem Temple, and the Torah framed his understanding of
revelation, his ethical practice, and his teaching.
Holding fast to one God
The Jews’ belief in one God set them apart from most other groups
of people at the time. Rather than multiple temples in each city
dedicated to different gods, the Jews had only one major Temple in
Jerusalem dedicated to their one God, Yahweh. Some of the Jewish
groups thought that angels and demons were operating alongside
God, but they didn’t believe that those other divine beings should
be worshipped or that their power was the same as God’s.
The Romans occasionally got irritated that Jewish belief in one god
prevented them from joining in Roman festivals and sacrifices. Plus,
the Jews took every Saturday off as the Sabbath (the day of rest to
honor God) while everyone else kept working. It really made it 
obvious that the Jews were present and on someone else’s clock
(namely their God’s). But, for the most part, the Roman emperors of
the early empire generally respected Jewish customs because they
recognized Judaism as an old and venerable tradition.
Worshipping in the Temple
One commonality that the Jews shared with their Greek and
Roman neighbors was the practice of praying and honoring God in
a temple with prayers, offerings, sacrifices, and songs. In fact, Jews
and Christians today still share some of these practices, including
praying, making monetary offerings, pledging certain vows, and
singing hymns when they gather to worship. What made the first-
century Jewish practice different from today, however, was the
practice of sacrifice. That practice happened in one place only: the
Jerusalem Temple.
Some Jewish splinter groups set up alternative temples in other
places, such as in Jordan, Leontopolis in Egypt, and Samaria (see
the section, “The heretical Samaritans,” later in this chapter). One
group was so disturbed by leadership and conduct of the sacrifices
Chapter 7: Taking a Snapshot of Jewish Society in Jesus’s Time 101

Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
102
in Jerusalem that they set up an alternative community in the Dead
Sea wilderness. They thought of their community as a kind of
Temple (see the later section, “The strict, apocalyptic Essenes”).
But by and large, when Jews referred to the Jewish Temple in the
first century, everyone understood that they meant the one Temple
in Jerusalem that was dedicated to the service of the one God.
Offering animals and grain to thank God for blessings
Much of the Jewish law found in the books of Exodus and Leviticus
in the Old Testament lays out the rules for animal sacrifice in the
Temple. Different animals were used for different purposes. The
Jews, for example, may have offered an animal from their herd to
atone for wrongdoing or to pray for well-being. The priests would
slaughter the animal, splash its blood on the sides of the altar, and
burn the body on the altar so that the fragrant smoke would ascend.
Another type of offering that Jews may have provided was grain or
flour that was raw, baked, or fried and maybe mixed with oil and
aromatic spices. The priests would toss a handful on the altar fire
(which was always burning) and keep the rest as a payment in kind
for their services.
The Jews had sin and guilt offerings and offerings to begin and end
the day. They even had offerings to mark the important festivals of
the year. Sometimes the animal or grain was fully burned, some-
times part was eaten by the priest, and sometimes the worship-
pers themselves got a portion. Between the incense and all the
meat cooking, the place probably smelled great — maybe like a
tailgate party before a football game!
The general purpose of the practice of sacrifice was to fulfill the
command of God in the scriptures, to imitate God’s purity and
power, and to attract God’s presence through sincere prayer and
fragrant smoke (though the Jewish people didn’t actually think God
could physically smell or drop in for a visit). They performed sacri-
fices as a return of the good things God had blessed them with, in
the hope that God would continue to bless them. With their sacri-
fices, they also acknowledged their regret for sins against God’s law
that jeopardized their relationships with God and others.
Centering on the sacred in the Jerusalem Temple
The fact that Jews had only one central shrine paralleled and
reflected their belief that there was only one God. The centraliza-
tion of worship in one place also emphasized the identity of the
Jewish people as a single nation called into existence by this one
God. The Temple was built to imitate the movement from the pro-
fane world of other nations and daily life into the sacred world of
the chosen people and the single God.

The focus on the sacred in Judaism explains the reason for the
layout of the Temple. The Temple was imagined as the navel of the
universe, with its center being a kind of Paradise on earth. It was
built in a series of concentric rings moving from the secular out-
side to the sacred interior. Each “ring” admitted people with
increasing degrees of sanctity:
 Non-Jews could enter the Court of the Gentiles in the Temple,
but that was as far as they could go.
 Jewish women could enter the Court of the Women, but they
could go no farther.
 Jewish men could enter the next ring, the Court of the
Israelites, but that was it.
 Priests (and only priests) could enter the Priests’ Court,
where the altars were located.
 Only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies (and he
could enter only once a year). The Holy of Holies is where
God’s presence was thought to dwell in the midst of the people.
Those Jews who came to the Temple had to purify themselves in
order to enter the Temple precincts. They could purify themselves
in a number of ways: by washing in special baths, abstaining tem-
porarily from sex, fasting, making special vows, or donating money
to charity. People practiced these ethical commitments regularly in
their day-to-day lives and certainly when they prepared them-
selves to visit the central sanctuary in Jerusalem.
The priests and the Levites (the priests’ assistants in the Temple)
were set apart in purity from other people. Their separation was
even considered biological. For example, to fill one of these posi-
tions, they had to come from a certain tribe; the high priests had
to come from a certain clan within that tribe. They also had to
observe stricter customs for keeping themselves pure throughout
the year — especially for the two weeks a year when their “course”
or group was on call for Temple duty (the priests lived throughout
the land, with a majority of them living in Judea near the Temple).
Traveling to Jerusalem for festivals
Not all Jews in Judea, the Galilee, and the Diaspora could get to the
Jerusalem Temple very often or very easily. It’s true that with
Herod the Great’s road improvements (see the earlier section, “A
patron for the Jewish people”), more people were able to make pil-
grimages to Jerusalem for one or more of the three annual harvest
festivals: Passover in the spring, Shavuot (or Pentecost) 40 days
later, and Sukkot in the fall. And many people throughout the
empire paid an annual tax for the Temple’s upkeep regardless of
whether they could travel there themselves.

Praying at home
Because the Temple was pretty far away from where most Jews
lived, there were a lot of local religious customs that developed
apart from it. Jewish law required the circumcision of boys and the
keeping of kosher laws (such as the prohibition on eating pork).
These practices were observed throughout Palestine and even in
the Diaspora. Some local practitioners of healing and exorcism
viewed themselves as acting in the name and power of God.
Prayer was also an important part of Jewish life. Some Jews said
certain prayers daily, particularly the command to love God with
all one’s heart, soul, and strength. They were to teach and remem-
ber this mitzvah (or command) by binding it on their foreheads
and wrists while at prayer and by placing it in their doorposts
(Deuteronomy 6:4–9). These practices continue today.
Observing the Torah
The Torah is composed of the first five books of the Old Testament:
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. It tells the
story of the Israelite people (the ancestors of the Jews of Jesus’s
time), including the following bits that mix legend and history:
 Their creation and the stories of their ancestors
 Their Exodus or escape from Egypt
 The declaration of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai
 Their 40 years of wandering in the wilderness and their arrival
on the edge of the Promised Land
Reflecting Temple practices at home
As Jews traveled between Jerusalem and their homes, their local practices paral-
leled customs that were upheld in the Temple. For example:
 Just as the Torah was discussed and interpreted in Jerusalem at the Temple, so
too was it interpreted in villages by local priests, laypeople, scholars, and stu-
dents. They discussed the Torah both during Sabbath meetings in the syna-
gogue and as questions arose (see Acts 15:21).
 Like Jews at the Temple, some local Jews purified themselves through ritual
washings in Jewish villages. They used the ritual baths built for the purpose to
cleanse the impurities of daily life.

In Jesus’s time, all Jewish groups we know about saw the Torah 
(or “law”) as the cornerstone of their faith. The Torah grounded
their relationship with God, provided their sense of who God was,
and gave them a code of behavior that demanded a lot from them
in response to God’s election and blessing of them. (For more infor-
mation about the Torah, check out The Torah For Dummies by
Arthur Kurzweil, published by Wiley.) In addition to the Torah,
other religious books were collected and regarded highly (see the
nearby sidebar “Was there such a thing as a Jewish Bible?”).
Meeting the Major Groups 
in Jewish Society
The gospels and some other first-century sources refer to several
groups in first-century Jewish society: Sadducees, Pharisees,
Essenes, Zealots, and Samaritans. These groups were prominent, but
not dominant. Together, they made up maybe 15–30 percent of the
population in Judea, and they were probably even more lightly rep-
resented to the north, in Samaria and the Galilee (Josephus, Jewish
War 2.8.2–14; Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 13.5.9). As for the other
70–85 percent of the population, we simply don’t have much infor-
mation about them. Ancient historians usually weren’t interested in
the common folk unless they broke out in a rebellion of some kind,
and archaeologists have only begun to focus on the living spaces
and lifestyles of the common people rather than on their rulers. 
Chapter 7: Taking a Snapshot of Jewish Society in Jesus’s Time 105
Was there such a thing as a Jewish Bible?
Other books besides the five in the Torah were compiled in stages between per-
haps 1000 and 100 BCE. These books included those written by the prophets who
had lived at the time of the Jewish monarchy and whose books were sometimes
supplemented later. Also included are “writings” such as proverbs, psalms, and
other wisdom traditions. But not everybody agreed that these were as authoritative
as the Torah. And even those groups that did view them as authoritative often
included different ones.
In fact, there wasn’t any such thing as a “Bible” among the Jews — if by Bible you
mean a set of agreed-upon, authoritative, and normative books bound between two
covers. Books bound between two covers didn’t even become popular until the
second or third century CE. More importantly, though, different groups had differ-
ent collections of scrolls. It wasn’t until the late first century CE that we have any evi-
dence of Jewish lists of the approved books, and it’s clear that some Jewish groups
like the Essenes counted a good many more books as scripture. The Christians didn’t
compile their complete, official list until the mid-fourth century (see Chapter 5).

Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
106
The groups in the following sections all believed in God, Temple,
and Torah, but each group differed in some important ways. While
Jesus wasn’t a member of any of these groups, the gospels report
that he did interact with some of them and that some of them were
openly antagonistic toward him.
The conservative Sadducees
At the conservative end of the religious spectrum and the upper
end of the social and religious ladder were the Sadducees. No one
is sure how they got their name. It may have derived from tsaddiq
(“righteous one”) or from the name Zadok, after the founder of the
high priestly line in the time of King David.
The Sadducees are considered conservative because they thought
that the Torah alone — as interpreted by them — should guide
faith and practice. This sole reliance on the Torah ruled out the
prophetic and wisdom books (such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and
Psalms). These later books and traditions had led some Jews to
believe in a final judgment and a resurrection of just people
because they couldn’t stomach that the good suffered and the evil
enjoyed the high life. The Sadducees rejected these notions, which
meant that they didn’t believe in a resurrection of the dead
(Matthew 22:23–33; Acts 23:6–10; Acts 13 takes a look at the gospel
portrait of the Sadducees).
The liberal Pharisees
The Pharisees made their debut during the Hasmonean monarchy
(which I discuss earlier in this chapter). The first Pharisees were
pious Jews who were troubled by the Hellenizing reforms of the
Seleucid King Antiochus IV and the behavior of the Hasmoneans and
their Sadducean allies. The Pharisees often opposed both of these
groups, and because of this opposition, one of the Hasmonean kings
crucified thousands of Pharisees. Later, the Sadducees and
Pharisees took opposite sides in the Hasmonean civil war.
The name “Pharisee” may come from the Hebrew word parush,
meaning “detached” or “separated.” The Pharisees, who were both
laypeople and priests, attempted to live by the purity regulations
that priests observed (I discuss the special purity requirements of
the priests earlier in this chapter). The gospels present these prac-
tices as a heavy burden that Pharisees were trying to impose on
others, but the Pharisees understood it as a reform of the covenant
(the relationship established in the Torah between God and the
people expressed in Jewish ethical and worship practices).

For the Pharisees, the written Torah was central. But in order to
invigorate written scripture and apply it in their day, they added to
it the “traditions of the elders” (Jewish rabbis would later call this
the “oral Torah”). They believed that these traditions included those
stories and teachings that Moses received but hadn’t written down,
along with interpretations of the law that had been transmitted by
the sages through the ages. With greater freedom than the conserva-
tive Sadducees, the Pharisees thought that God hadn’t simply
carved things on stone tablets hundreds of years before. Instead,
they believed that God continued to reveal things. This openness to
ongoing revelation made them more “liberal” in their stance toward
scripture than the Sadducees. It’s no surprise, then, that they
accepted prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah and “the writ-
ings” (books like Psalms and Proverbs) and developed some of their
characteristic beliefs — such as the importance of angels and spirits
and the resurrection of the dead — from their interpretations of
them (Isaiah 26:19; Ezekiel 37; Daniel 12:1–4; Job 19:25–26).
The strict, apocalyptic Essenes
Another Jewish social group during Jesus’s time was the Essenes.
The Jewish historian Josephus and a few other first-century writ-
ers mention them, but they’re nowhere to be found in the gospels.
This may be because they lived out by the Dead Sea, which is far
from Jesus’s Galilean roots.
Because ancient descriptions of the Essenes are strikingly similar
to some of the teachings found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, many
people believe the Essenes are the collectors and authors of those
scrolls (see Chapter 5). Most of the 800-plus manuscripts that form
the bulk of the Dead Sea Scrolls have survived only in tiny pieces
or worm-eaten fragments. But enough has survived to make clear
that the compilers were heavily into religious literature. Many of
those scroll manuscripts and fragments are books from the Torah,
prophets, and writings (in fact, every biblical book currently in the
Jewish Bible is represented except Esther and Nehemiah). There
are also a lot of copies of apocalyptic works (books that convey
special revelation in mysterious images and symbols of a pending
end of time) and wisdom books (instructions on how to live and on
divine wisdom) that apparently were authoritative for the Essenes
but never made it into anyone else’s “Bible.” They also wrote some
of their own works, which are a curious and interesting blend of
apocalyptic expectation, legal norms, and wisdom speculation.
Like the Pharisees, the Essenes thought that the sacrificial system
in the Temple had gone awry and that everyone in the community
should adhere to a strict code of ethics. What was different, how-
ever, was that the Essenes were so upset with the Temple that they
stopped going to it entirely. They even used a solar calendar to set
Chapter 7: Taking a Snapshot of Jewish Society in Jesus’s Time 107

Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
108
time (rather than the lunar calendar that the Jerusalem Temple
probably used). And their interpretations of the Torah were much
stricter than those of any other Jewish group.
In fact, the Essenes considered their strict code of ethics their new
mode of sacrifice, which showed how reluctant they were to ditch
the sacrificial system entirely (I discuss sacrifices earlier in this
chapter). Their love of the Temple and hope for its restoration by a
priestly messiah suggests the group’s origins in priestly circles.
(See the nearby sidebar “The messianic prophecies” for more
about different groups’ thoughts on messiahs.)
In their messianic expectations, their apocalyptic hopes for a
divine intervention, and their attempt to live a utopian, end-time
lifestyle (sharing goods in common, praying regularly, and healing
people), the Essenes actually share several features with John the
Baptist and some of Jesus’s early followers, although in other ways
they’re quite different (see Chapter 10 for details).
The rebellious Zealots
Josephus, who wrote after the first Jewish Revolt against Rome in
66–70 CE, was keen to explain the rise of another group in Jewish
society: the Zealots. He said the group had its origins when Rome
seized Judea and Samaria in 6 CE and when Judas the Galilean and
Zadok the Pharisee led a rebellion against the Roman tax census
(see Chapter 6 for more on this census; Acts 5:37 also mentions it).
But there isn’t a lot of evidence of a group calling itself by that
name until the First Jewish Revolt against Rome. One thing is clear:
When they did arise, the Zealots opposed Roman rule and often
engaged in guerrilla warfare to combat it.
Josephus reported that Zealot beliefs were similar to those of the
Pharisees. What differentiated them was that they had an intense
attachment to liberty and were willing to fight for the notion that
their only ruler and lord was God himself, as the Torah required.
One of Jesus’s closest disciples is a man named Simon the
“Cananean” (Mark 3:18; Matthew 10:4), which is the Aramaic word
for “zealous” or “jealous” (thus Luke names him “Simon the
zealot”; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13). (Flip to Chapters 2 and 10 for more
on Simon.) But in the gospels, it probably functioned more as an
adjective than as the name of a formal group he belonged to.
The heretical Samaritans
Some of the people who lived in Samaria, just north of Judea,
thought of themselves as Jewish but were not viewed as such by

their Judean neighbors. These folks, called Samaritans, had a copy
of the Torah, but it looked a little different from everyone else’s.
Like the Sadducees, they considered their Torah the only scrip-
tures; they didn’t accept any other books. They also had their own
temple and priesthood on Mount Gerizim — well, at least they did
until the Hasmonean King John Hyrcanus destroyed it in 128 BCE.
(The temple on Mount Gerizim is the temple that the Samaritan
woman in John 4:20 refers to when she tells Jesus, “Our ancestors
worshiped on this mountain.”) These differences of Torah text and
Temple practice were aggravated by a couple of centuries of ani-
mosity between the Samaritans and their Judean neighbors after
the Babylonian Exile. By Jesus’s time, any Jew who worshipped in
the Jerusalem Temple would have considered the Samaritan reli-
gion aberrant, and vice versa.
Chapter 7: Taking a Snapshot of Jewish Society in Jesus’s Time 109
The messianic prophecies
Messiah is Hebrew for “anointed one” (the Greek translation is “Christ”). Kings and
priests, for example, were anointed for their jobs. The earliest reference to an
“anointed one” in the Jewish scriptures is the promise that an heir to the great King
David would always be sitting on the Jewish throne (2 Samuel 7:11–17).
When the immediate line of heirs was killed during the Babylonian Exile, the bibli-
cal promise was reinterpreted in the following ways:
 Some still expected a king from the line of David (Matthew 1).
 Others thought a foreign king would suffice (Isaiah 45:1 names the Persian King
Cyrus a messiah).
 Others expected a prophet like Moses to restore the true practice of the law
(Deuteronomy 18:15–20).
 Some expected a priestly messiah, especially after the Seleucids defiled the
Temple and the Hasmoneans took over the high priesthood (even though they
were from the wrong family).
 Some thought a heavenly messiah or Son of Man would come “on the clouds
of heaven” and serve as judge and ruler of the cosmos (Daniel 7:13–14).
 Some groups, such as the Essenes, expected several of these types of messi-
ahs, while others, such as the early Christians, imagined one figure who fused
the different roles together.
No matter what kind of messiah these groups expected, each group agreed that
the figure would usher in a new age on God’s behalf, characterized by the destruc-
tion of evil, the triumph of good, the healing of illness, the elevation of the poor, the
freeing of prisoners, and the restoration of the land.

Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
110
The animosity between the Samaritans and Jews is what helped
make the parable of the Good Samaritan so powerful in Luke’s
gospel (Luke 10:25–37). After all, who in Jesus’s audience would
ever have imagined that a Samaritan guy would help a mugged Jew
as his fellow Jews passed right by?
Belonging to Social Networks
First-century Jews may not have had the Internet to help them net-
work with other people, but they did have personal networks that
were built around extended families and ethnic groups. People
needed these extended networks to survive because they lived in a
society where the majority of people were subsistence farmers.
And unlike today, at that time, there was no welfare state to fall
back on in retirement or during rough times. Jesus encouraged his
followers to leave everything behind to follow him, which meant
that they would have to leave their normal social networks and
join his new one. The following sections give you the background
you need to appreciate how difficult that would have been and
how it may have shaped the early Jesus movement.
To understand the social networks, it helps to think of society in
Palestine like a pyramid. There really isn’t a middle class in a soci-
ety like this one (see Chapter 13 for more information):
 At the top is the very tiny group of true elites, who own most
of the land and hobnob with the Herodians and the ruling
Romans.
 Beneath the elites is a slightly larger group of folks that keeps
things running for the elites. This group includes bureaucrats,
scribes, lawyers, soldiers, tax collectors, and so on.
 Below the upper stratum is the lower layer, which includes the
vast majority of working people. The people classified in this
level are mostly farmers but also included are some merchants
and tradespeople, such as metalworkers, tanners, and tent-
makers. Some had enough resources to hire day workers, and
some owned slaves. But most would have been fairly poor.
 Below the working poor are the truly destitute — those who
have disabilities and can’t work. This group of people
depends on the charity of others to survive.
Relying on the family
Most people in first-century Palestine were poor farmers. Some
people owned small plots of land, but many just worked land for
wealthier people. If they actually owned land to grow barley or

dates, they were often just a couple of poor harvests away from
destitution. Taxes had to be paid regardless of drought, locusts, or
other natural disasters. So, people often had to borrow money to
pay their taxes. A couple of years after accumulating that kind of
debt, people found themselves selling their services or even their
family members as slaves.
Given how vulnerable most people were economically, they really
depended on their families for survival. So, families couldn’t afford
to be small like the nuclear families of today. Instead, people
needed to stay near their relatives so that, in a time of need, they
could turn to someone. This commitment to family is embedded in
the Ten Commandments, which specifically tells people to honor
their fathers and mothers (Exodus 20:12). “Honor” here means
respect, but it also refers to the obligation of people to take care of
their fathers and mothers in their old age and to be a financial
safety net so that their parents don’t fear destitution.
The extended families in Palestine centered on the husband’s
family. When a girl married (usually within a few years of starting
menstruation), she left her parents and moved in with her husband
and his parents and kin. Father-centered families like this were called
patriarchal families, and in these families the men ruled the roost.
They also represented the family in the economic, political, and
legal spheres outside the home. For example, a woman couldn’t
represent herself in court. So a man (probably her husband) func-
tioned as her legal guardian or representative, no matter how old
she was. This strong reliance on her husband gives you an idea of
how vulnerable a woman could become if she were widowed.
It was also important to men to protect their wives and daughters
and to make certain that children were actually theirs. So even
though women could and did go outside the home for various
chores, social events, and religious festivals, social expectations
required that they do so discreetly. Women were, in a sense, a kind
of property of their husbands. Because of this view, adultery and
even rape of a wife was defined as a violation of the husband’s
rights. This wasn’t true just of Jewish society, but of ancient
Mediterranean societies in general.
Slaves were considered to be part of the family network during this
time. A lot of people, even poor people, owned slaves. In fact, slav-
ery was a fairly accepted feature of ancient life. Parents could sell
their children into slavery. And don’t forget that slavery meant 
that the slave had to serve the master through work, sex, bearing
children, or whatever else he needed.

Depending on help from fellow Jews
First-century Jews depended on each other to get by. That didn’t
mean that every Jew helped every other Jew, but, in general, they
could depend on a kind of sympathy from each other because they
belonged to the same ethnic group. They met regularly on the
Sabbath, conducted business together, provided mutual aid in sup-
port of the sick, ill, and widowed, and often provided hospitality to
each other. This sympathy particularly helped those Jews who
were living farther from Judea in the Diaspora. Jews there were at
most a minority community in larger Greco-Roman cities, and so
found strength in numbers and in their shared traditions. They
earned the respect of their Gentile (non-Jewish) neighbors for the
venerability and ethical depth of their traditions.
The flip side of this sympathetic behavior was that, by and large,
people didn’t treat other ethnic groups as well as they treated their
“neighbors.” People gave what they got, and with so little to go
around, respect and honor was reserved to those closest to them,
those who did the most for them, or those who coerced it from
them (such as rulers and toll collectors).
Protecting strangers and aliens
While resources were limited and the obligation to tend to one’s
family and ethnic group took priority, Jewish law also mandated a
minimal level of care for immigrants (called “aliens” or “strangers”
in the Bible) living in Jewish lands. Sensitive to their own treatment
at the hands of empires and foreigners, the Jews sought to treat
strangers living in their own land better. Even though no one knows
how this played out in practice, the Torah at least prescribed that
aliens shouldn’t be oppressed (Exodus 22:20, 23:9; Leviticus
19:33–34; Deuteronomy 10:18–19; 24:17–18; Zechariah 7:10).

Feeling Rome’s Influence
In This Chapter
 Exploring how Rome governed its provinces
 Understanding Roman control of the economy
 Detecting Rome’s impact on religion
B
y the time Jesus was born, the Roman Empire had been more
or less in control of Palestine for 60 years. I say more or less
because with the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE, the
ensuing civil wars in Rome, and the regional flare-ups where petty
rulers tried to take advantage of the situation, there wasn’t much
of that famous Pax Romana (Roman peace) that’s always talked
about. But by 37 BCE, Herod the Great secured his kingdom in
Judea, and six years later, Octavian got a lock on the Roman
Empire (Chapters 6 and 7 cover these events). With strong leaders
in place, Roman peace became reality.
In this chapter, you see how Rome managed its far-flung territories
before and during Jesus’s lifetime. You get a sense of how the
Romans deployed their army and worked with the local leaders in
the different regions. You also discover the economic impact of
Rome’s presence on the average person — the very group from
which many in Jesus’s movement came — and you see the impact of
Rome’s presence on the religious practices and beliefs of the people.
Governing Jesus’s Homeland
The Romans’ goals in expanding their empire were fairly straight-
forward: They wanted as much income from as much territory as
they could successfully manage. They also wanted all the glory
that went along with their successful takeovers.
The region of Palestine (Jesus’s homeland), for example, provided
no small amount of income from its own native agriculture and
local industries. But Rome recognized Palestine for yet another
reason. Its primary value to Rome was its location along the
Mediterranean coast. Because Palestine straddled the highways

Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
114
connecting Egypt to Mesopotamia and the caravan routes connect-
ing China and India with the Mediterranean, whoever ruled the
region was in a great position to control both military and trade
routes. Rome wanted the region quiet, stable, and loyal, and its
emperors were willing to collaborate with anyone who could pro-
vide such guarantees.
Rome wouldn’t start calling the region “Palestine” officially until
after the Second Jewish Revolt (132–135 CE). But I’ll use the term
to refer to the entire region in this chapter because it’s a little
easier than referring to all the little kingdoms that constituted it,
such as Judea, Samaria, and the Galilee.
When the Roman general Pompey entered Palestine in 63 BCE, he
didn’t take over direct control of Palestine because he didn’t have
that kind of manpower. Rome generally found it more advantageous
to let the locals run things for them. Instead, Pompey created an
administrative province in Syria that was run by a Roman legate
(a provincial governor). The legate was responsible for making sure
that peace was maintained and that income flowed back to Rome.
If the local aristocrats couldn’t manage things on their own, Rome
would step in and administer things themselves. This happened in
6 CE in Judea, Samaria, and Idumea when Herod Archelaus, one of
Herod the Great’s sons, mismanaged things badly. Rome absorbed
the region into the imperial province of Syria and installed a local
prefect (a governor of equestrian rank).
In the following sections, I explain how the Romans ran Palestine —
mostly with the help of the army and local aristocrats. This infor-
mation gives you a backdrop for Jesus’s ministry and helps explain
why the Romans wanted him out of the picture.
Keeping the peace through 
the force of the army
The primary way that Rome maintained the peace in the region of
Palestine was through the coercive and deterrent force of its army.
In that sense, empires haven’t changed much! In the following sec-
tions, I discuss the staffing, positioning, services, and payment of
the Roman army in Palestine.
Staffing and positioning the army
Rome maintained two separate armies: the professional army of
Roman citizens and the auxiliary army of soldiers drawn from all
parts of the empire. The auxiliary army was often run by local
client kings (whom I discuss later in this chapter) and warlords.

Chapter 8: Feeling Rome’s Influence 115
Here’s how the armies were organized:
 Men were arranged into units of 100 called centuries, which
were led by centurions.
 Six centuries (600 men) formed a cohort, which was led by a
tribune.
 Ten cohorts (6,000 men) composed a legion, which was led by
a general.
The professional army was composed of free Roman citizens who,
by the time of Augustus (see Chapter 6), were career military men.
The lowest rank of officers were the centurions, who came from
the equestrian orders (the knights in the Roman army), from city
council posts, and from various cohorts where they had served
well. The next highest military officers were the tribunes, who
were of equestrian rank. The generals came from the Roman
Senate. If these high-ranking guys did well on the battlefield, they
could improve their fortunes financially and politically. This mili-
tary career ladder was so well established that the Romans even
gave it a name: the cursus honorum (“course of honor”).
As far as positioning was concerned, the Romans were generally
content to keep three to five legions in the Syrian provincial capital
Antioch. From there, the legions could be mobilized to deal with
border attacks, internal uprisings, and the banditry and piracy that
plagued the region. If it felt the need, Rome could position a couple
of cohorts or centuries in important cities as well, which may be
why you occasionally hear of centurions in the gospels (Matthew
8:5–13 and Luke 7:1–10 both refer to centurions in Capernaum;
Mark 15:39, Matthew, 27:54, and Luke 23:47 refer to centurions in
Jerusalem). After 6 CE, when Rome annexed Judea, Samaria, and
Idumea as the new province of Judea, the local prefects usually
kept about 2,400 men (four cohorts) in Caesarea Maritima or in
Sebaste. They also kept one cohort in the Antonia Fortress on the
edge of Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
These local cohorts were drawn from the auxiliary army but were
organized just like the professional army. The soldiers came from
various regions, and their common language was likely Greek.
Because the soldiers weren’t Jewish and were there to occupy the
country, they could be pretty contemptuous of the Jews as the
Jews could be of them. This contempt periodically led to flare-ups
around the time of Jesus and explains how volatile the situation
could become (see the later section, “Impacting Jewish Religion
with Roman Practice,” for more details).
Surveying the army’s services
The Roman army — both the professional legionaries and the local
auxiliaries — provided the following services to the empire:

 It kept the peace by protecting the edges of the empire against
would-be invaders.
 It was constantly on call to take out the pirates and bandits
who harassed pilgrims, travelers, and merchants.
 In large cities, it often helped the local police to keep the peace
(for example, in Jerusalem during the pilgrimage festivals).
 The army sometimes assisted in the engineering and building
projects, such as aqueducts and roads.
After Octavian received the titles Augustus and princeps (first citi-
zen) and thus became the emperor of Rome (see Chapter 6), the
army’s services had the effect of fostering travel and trade and thus
prosperity throughout the empire — especially for Rome’s allies.
Paying for the army’s services
The professional legionaries and auxiliary soldiers had to be paid,
housed, fed, and entertained. The Roman attitude on this issue was
that the folks receiving the “benefit” of the army’s services should
be the ones to foot the bill. So, the colonial subjects found them-
selves paying to be occupied! The forms of payment varied. The
most common were the following:
 Tribute: Sometimes Rome would force a subject population to
pay tribute, which was a fixed sum or tithe that the local ruler
would be responsible for raising. The province of Syria, which
included the semi-independent client kingdoms of Judea, the
Galilee, and the parts in between, was supposed to pay this
tribute from 63 BCE on. However, the legates in Syria weren’t
able to collect payments consistently because of the chaos of
the Roman civil wars (flip to Chapter 6 for more on that).
When Herod the Great became King of the Jews, Rome
exempted Judea from the tribute payments as a reward for the
king’s loyalty. However, when Rome assumed direct control of
Judea and turned it into a separate province in 6 CE, Rome con-
ducted a property census so that the prefect could collect the
tribute (check out Chapters 6 and 9 for more on this census).
 Billeting: Because the Roman army needed to be housed and
entertained (particularly through the winter months when it
was too cold for battle and their tents weren’t adequate pro-
tection against the weather), the provincial governors some-
times picked cities that they wanted to punish and made them
play host to the army. This punishment, which was referred to
as billeting, often ruined the cities financially because they
were expected to pay for all the soldiers’ food and entertain-
ment and had to kick people out of their own houses to lodge
them. Cities often paid bribes to receive exemptions or sought
alliances with Rome in order to be treated more generously.
Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
116

 Molestation: Molestation was the act of being pressed into
various forms of service to support the army. It could mean
• Seizure of the people’s donkeys or carts for transport
• Confiscation of people’s grain, supplies, and livestock to
feed the soldiers and their horses
• The coercion of someone off the street to haul Roman
equipment (as when Simon of Cyrene was forced to carry
Jesus’s cross; Mark 15:21; Matthew 27:32; Luke 23:26)
• The theft of clothing, supplies, or slaves (in Luke 6:29–30
and Matthew 5:40–41, Jesus teaches what to do when
someone “takes” your cloak) and the rape of wives,
daughters, and sons
• A kind of selective lack of protection, perhaps of pil-
grims going up to Jerusalem or of foreign Jews trying to
deliver collections of donated money to the Jerusalem
Temple
 Conscription: Rome often conscripted (forced) people into its
auxiliary armies for military service. Given the frequent mili-
tary campaigns that were waged as generals sought to climb
their way up the cursus honorum, there was a powerful and
ongoing need for more men.
Needless to say, the local rulers in Rome’s provinces sought exemp-
tions from these forced payments and services. Judea, for example,
was particularly fortunate, because even though King Hyrcanus II
and his Idumean friend Antipater had initially fought against Julius
Caesar, they switched sides in the nick of time and proved to be
important allies to Rome (see Chapter 7). As a result, Caesar
granted Hyrcanus favors in 47 BCE that included exemptions from
all the previously listed payments. But these favors could always be
withdrawn as new emperors, governors, or prefects came to power.
Allying with local aristocrats
The Romans generally relied on local aristocrats to run the day-to-
day affairs in the provinces. These elites were given different ranks
depending on how valuable they were to Rome. I explain these
ranks in the following sections.
Ethnarchs, tetrarchs, and client kings
The first Jews to ally with Rome were the Hasmonean King
Hyrcanus II and his Idumean friend Antipater (see Chapter 7). The
Roman general Pompey rewarded them for the alliance in 63 BCE
by allowing Hyrcanus to resume duties as the high priest in the
Jerusalem Temple and to assume the title of ethnarch (ruler of the
Chapter 8: Feeling Rome’s Influence 117

ethnos or ethnic group of Jews). However, Pompey also removed a
lot of the Hasmoneans’ territory and annexed it directly to Syria.
When the Parthians, an empire based in modern-day Iran, invaded
Judea in 40 BCE, Rome wasn’t about to give up the region. So, the
Roman Senate told Antipater’s son Herod to drive back the
Parthians and their Hasmonean allies, and he did. He was
rewarded by Rome, but he was loathed by many Jews. Herod was,
after all, a second-generation convert to Judaism, unlike the
priestly Hasmoneans. As such, Herod had absolutely no legitimate
historical claim to the throne.
But the Romans looked for legitimacy elsewhere. They felt that
legitimacy lay in a person’s ability to control and produce income
from a territory and to remain a loyal ally. Herod fit the bill. The
Romans acknowledged his success by granting him territory
beyond Jerusalem. This territory included his ancestral Idumea,
the region of Samaria, and the Galilee. Herod eventually controlled
all the major trade hubs and routes in the region (see Chapter 7 for
details). Rome then gave him the title of “King of the Jews,” which
was the highest rank that a local ruler could have. The title implied
a higher level of trust and responsibility.
Herod’s kingdom was split between his three sons when he died in
4 BCE. Rome felt that none of them deserved the title of “king.”
Instead, Rome gave two of them — Philip and Herod Antipas — the
title of tetrarch, which literally meant “ruler of a fourth.” (By this
time, it no longer meant an actual “fourth” of a kingdom, but just
referred to a region too minor to merit a higher-level ruler). Philip
became tetrarch of the northeast (lower Syria), and Herod Antipas
became tetrarch of the Galilee and Perea. Both men ruled through-
out the lifetime of Jesus.
Herod Archelaus, Herod’s third son, became ethnarch of Judea,
Samaria, and Idumea, but his rule only lasted nine years. He mis-
managed things so badly that the Romans kicked him out, created
a new province called Judea, and appointed a prefect to govern it
directly. Pontius Pilate, the fifth prefect sent to Judea, was running
the show when Jesus met his end.
Aristocrats, priests, and imperial retainers
Beneath the client kings and the other rulers were the various aris-
tocrats who owned property and the bureaucrats, or retainer class,
who managed the business of the kingdom (for a diagram of the
local power pyramid, see Chapter 13). Here’s the lowdown on
these two groups:
 Aristocrats: In Palestine in general, the aristocracy included
large landowners in the villages, towns, and cities. In Judea it
Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
118

also included some of the priests, as well as the Sadducees.
Given the importance of Jerusalem and its Temple (see
Chapter 7), the Roman prefect worked closely with these aris-
tocrats. And because the aristocrats were concerned about
keeping their land and status, they were happy to collaborate
with Rome.
 The retainer class: These folks served the Romans and the
local aristocrats. The class included the legate’s and prefect’s
armies and staffs, the local ruler’s staff, the scribes who kept
the political, military, and economic records, the individuals
employed by the aristocrats to collect taxes and tolls, and the
private armies, bodyguards, or police forces of the aristocrats.
Resisting Rome
The Romans were able to exercise effective control of their Jewish
client kingdoms and the Judean province during the years of
Jesus’s life, but they still found themselves facing some resistance.
That resistance took a variety of forms, including the following:
 Inventing a whole vocabulary of resistance that’s invisible to
the foreign occupiers — everything from symbolic messages
hidden in numbers (for example, 666 as a code name for
Caesar Nero in Revelation 13:18) to puns and inside jokes (like
Jesus expelling a “legion” of demons into a suicidal herd of
swine, Mark 5:1–20)
 Reclaiming one’s own traditions
 Using local rather than imported products
 Attacking the occupying army and its collaborators
Outright revolts occurred periodically during Jesus’s lifetime. For
example, as I mention in Chapter 7, riots broke out when Herod
hung a golden eagle (which was thought to be a pagan symbol) in
the Temple. Also, when the Romans annexed Judea and conducted
a property census for tax purposes (Luke 2:1–3), another revolt
broke out in the Galilee. This revolt was led by Judah, who rallied
people with the idea that they shouldn’t bow to a pagan empire
(Acts 5:37; Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 18.1.1).
The story of Jesus’s crucifixion indicates that he was lumped with
social bandits and rebels like Judah. For instance, he was arrested
like one (Mark 14:48), killed in place of one (Mark 15:6–15), and
crucified between two others (Mark 15:27). This doesn’t mean that
Jesus was a rebel or a thief; it simply means that he was mistaken
for one, which may have been why he was killed (for more on
Jesus’s crucifixion, flip to Chapter 14).
Chapter 8: Feeling Rome’s Influence 119

When there was an insurrection, Rome crushed it brutally. It would
send out the area cohort to battle the insurrectionists, and often
the cohort would arrest and execute any surviving rebels. If the
insurrection proved particularly difficult to quell, additional
legions could be summoned from Syria, as they were in the First
Jewish Revolt (66–74 CE).
Getting a Grip on the Economy
In addition to its strategic significance (which I discuss in the ear-
lier section, “Governing Jesus’s Homeland”), Palestine played an
economic role in the larger Roman Empire. Some of its produce,
such as dates, olives and olive oil, and wine, was prized for trade.
The rest was subject to taxes, which could be difficult to pay for
peasants who were just scraping by on their farming income.
Understanding the economic picture in the Roman-controlled
Palestine helps make Jesus’s teachings clearer, especially for
people today who live in economies based on industry and tech-
nology. Many of Jesus’s characteristic parables use examples of
seeds, tenant farming, large landowners, and debt to drive home
his lessons about the kingdom of God.
Working the land for crops
There are estimates that about 90 percent of the people in
Palestine were what we might call peasants. Most of these folks
probably fell into one of the following categories:
 Small landowners
 Tenants who worked other people’s land and paid rent
 Landless peasants who either worked as day laborers or
engaged in banditry (see the sidebar “Making a living in
Jesus’s day” for more information)
During the time of Jesus, the ruler of the region and the local aris-
tocrats had large agricultural estates encompassing some of the
best land in the region. There’s some evidence that these wealthy
folks were amassing more of the land at the expense of the small
landowners. Even then the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.
Most of the peasants in Jesus’s time needed to farm in order to sur-
vive. They grew their own food, and they sold any surplus to trade
for items that they couldn’t produce. The chief crops in the region
were grain, vegetables, fruits, and legumes. But some households
also produced some spices and meat. Meat wasn’t eaten very
Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
120

often, though, because it was expensive. The average peasant diet
was pretty simple, consisting mainly of barley bread, salt, olives,
oil, onions, and grapes.
Some of the regional crops were prized throughout the
Mediterranean and were often grown on aristocratic estates (but
were leased or were tended by day laborers or slaves). These cash
crops included dates and date wines from Jericho and the Dead Sea
region, balsam from Jericho for use in medicines, and some spices.
Building ports, trade routes, 
and village commerce
One of the things that made King Herod “the Great” (see Chapter 7)
was his success at improving trade facilities and securing local
control of important trade centers. He took a tiny coastal village at
Strato’s Tower near the Galilee and built it into a modern city
called Caesarea Maritima. He sank a lot of cash into making the
port the most technologically advanced in the Mediterranean. This
city had excellent offloading and warehousing facilities, which
drew ships and overland traders and increased the flow of import
and export duties. Similarly, Herod’s control of his ancestral land,
Idumea, which was south of Judea, and his alliances with the
Nabateans, whose kingdom encompassed land from southern Syria
to northwest Arabia and eastern Egypt, meant that he had a lock
on the overland caravan routes from China and India. When the
Romans granted Herod Gaza in 30 BCE, he had the port end of that
spice trade and with it all the import and export duties on trade
between the east and the Mediterranean.
Chapter 8: Feeling Rome’s Influence 121
Making a living in Jesus’s day
While a majority of the people in Jesus’s time farmed, the gospels mention a host
of other occupations, including carpenters, fishermen, merchants, stewards,
lawyers, builders, prostitutes, judges, tanners, innkeepers, doctors, teachers, labor-
ers, clothes cleaners, guards, potters, bakers, grinders of grain, and blacksmiths.
Also mentioned in the gospels are the retainer class positions (such as scribe, sol-
dier, and toll collector) that I mention earlier in this chapter.
Many people couldn’t make a living on the land and became bandits instead. Travel
was extremely dangerous as a result of these thieves, and so people usually trav-
eled in groups and didn’t carry much money with them. You hear about these ban-
dits in the gospels, such as the ones who beat up a man going down to Jericho in
Jesus’s parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37).

In addition to ports, Herod built up cities at important points along
the inland roads that ran up Palestine. An example of one such city
is Sebaste in Samaria. Herod’s son, Herod Antipas, who gained con-
trol of the Galilee, continued this practice, building cosmopolitan
Greek-style cities in, among others, Sepphoris (near Nazareth) and
Tiberias (on the Sea of Galilee). These cities functioned as adminis-
trative centers and trade hubs for local and international com-
merce. Of course, most of the local farmers couldn’t afford the
imported goods, so they stuck with the local products. But there is
evidence that even small rural villages grew at this time because of
the general increase in commerce.
Rome didn’t directly participate in the construction of these ports
and roads. In fact, they were quite grateful when the local rulers took
the onus on themselves to finance capital improvements like these.
The emperors read such expenditures as gestures of loyalty. They
understood the economics of the act — that improved infrastructure
meant more revenue for them and less money out of their pockets.
Paying taxes, tolls, and trade duties
Every Roman province was required to pay up in one way or
another to receive the privilege of Roman protection. Usually,
Rome would expect the local ruler to pay the hefty sum, and then
it would be up to that ruler to recoup the loss from his own people
in whatever way he could. The ruler and his fellow aristocrats also
were frequently “invited” to offer gifts, such as soldiers, fleets,
property, food, games, and precious items, to the Romans.
Herod the Great used different sources of cash for his payments
and gifts. For example, he would
 Collect tolls on the roads and in the markets and ports
 Collect booty from his battles
 Force payment from people he had conquered
 Dip into the income from his royal estates
Think Tony Soprano, first-century style: Herod would squeeze his
“captains” (the aristocrats), who would squeeze their clients
(smaller, local landlords), and so on down the food chain.
Everyone who had the responsibility or bought the contract to 
collect taxes would add a cut for themselves, too.
Estimates say that during Jesus’s lifetime the average farmer con-
tributed anywhere from 20 percent to 35 percent of his income in
taxes and tithes. Some scholars put the figure much higher, how-
ever. Farmers usually paid their land taxes with their crops. In this
Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
122

case, the ruler would cash out some of the produce, ship some 
of it off, or store it in huge granaries (in case of a bad crop year).
Besides paying taxes through tolls and duties, many Jews through-
out the empire also paid a couple of days’ wages a year to support
the Jerusalem Temple. And others took seriously the obligation to
tithe their produce for the support of their local priests.
If you couldn’t pay your taxes or rents, you could lose your prop-
erty and become a tenant farmer or wage laborer. Apparently,
some people even resorted to selling their children, wives, and
even themselves into slavery to pay off debts. Some scholars
believe this sort of thing happened a lot in first-century Palestine
as land became concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer
elites. However, the jury is out on that fact until more archaeologi-
cal data comes to light.
There’s no question that a tax load of 20–35 percent would be
rough for someone living from harvest to harvest and day to day.
The aristocrats and rulers were aware that they could squeeze
only so much blood out of a turnip. So, in difficult years of drought
or natural disaster, they would find ways to lessen the tax load on
their countrymen, if only for a year or two.
The risk of revolt was an incentive for the aristocrats to occasion-
ally reduce the tax load. I’ve already mentioned the revolt against
Roman census led by Judah the Galilean in 6 CE (see the earlier
section “Resisting Rome”). The Roman historian Tacitus said that
things got hot in 17 CE too, when Jews pressed for a reduction of
tribute (Tacitus, Annals 2.42). Apart from these two revolts, we
don’t hear about any peasant uprisings, at least in the Galilee,
during the time of Jesus. Living may have been difficult, but it
wasn’t so bad that there was widespread and violent unrest. That
would change, however, within 35 years of Jesus’s death, when a
massive Jewish revolt against Rome convulsed the region.
Impacting Jewish Religion 
with Roman Practice
Temples were important centers in ancient cities, especially in cities
like Jerusalem where there was only one. The Jerusalem Temple
(which I cover in detail in Chapter 7) was a huge commercial hub.
During a pilgrimage festival, Jews and non-Jews from all over the
Mediterranean would stream to Jerusalem to offer prayers and sacri-
fices, to sing, to share their traditions, to pay their tithes and taxes,
and to have a good time for days or even weeks. Apart from the fes-
tivals, there were always priests on call at the Temple for the daily
sacrifices and the various offerings petitioners came to make.
Chapter 8: Feeling Rome’s Influence 123

The Romans, on the other hand, had a very different religion from
the Jews. They worshipped many gods, including deceased emper-
ors such as Caesar and eventually Augustus. The Romans were
open to new cults, and they even constructed and dedicated tem-
ples to the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Persian god Mithras back
in Rome. The auxiliary Roman armies positioned in the region were
even more diverse. These armies were composed of Greek-speaking
men who were drawn from all parts of the empire and who also
worshipped many of their own gods.
Even though they’d had centuries of experience with it, the presence
of “idol worshipers” in Palestine was difficult for some Jews. They
were troubled by the presence of pagan customs, irritated by the
political autonomy of some of the Greek cities, and offended by the
way they had to struggle to survive under people they considered to
be outsiders. The situation was especially volatile in Jerusalem,
home of the single Jewish Temple to the single Jewish God.
This volatility helps explain the fact that when Jesus arrived in
Jerusalem that last time, the crowds began to gather behind him
and the Romans began to get nervous. They knew how easily the
people could turn against them in the national capital, and experi-
ence taught them that swift, decisive action was the best remedy.
Problematic practices and 
idolatrous images
The Romans and their Jewish aristocratic friends had to be careful
not to offend the sensibilities of the Jews, especially in Judea. For
example, if they built a gymnasium for men to exercise naked, as
was the Greek custom, the Jews wouldn’t take it well. It would be
like your city council rezoning your neighborhood as a nudist
colony. Some Jews were fairly comfortable with some Greek and
Roman customs, but others weren’t. They wanted to preserve their
own traditions.
Because of their differences in opinion, mutual contempt could
flare up between the Roman auxiliary army and the locals. There’s
a story, for example, of a soldier who was standing on the rampart
of the Temple one Passover and mooned the Jewish pilgrims and
pretended to pass gas. The pilgrims were so offended that they
began to riot, which led to hundreds of people being crushed to
death (Josephus, Jewish War 2.12.1).
Pontius Pilate, the prefect of Judea, could stoop pretty low, too
(though not as low as the mooning soldier!). Pilate, the prefect who
crucified Jesus, tried to introduce his cohorts’ military standards
in the holy city — he hung staffs with images of the emperor on
Part II: Reconstructing the World of Jesus 
124

them. The Jews forced him to remove the images (Josephus,
Jewish War 2.9.2–3; Jewish Antiquities 18.3.1). Another time, Pilate
hung some inscribed shields in Herod’s palace in Jerusalem. The
Jews took these shields to be blasphemous, and protested to
Emperor Tiberius, who forced Pilate to remove them (Philo,
Embassy to Gaius 38).
Pagan cities
Palestine had long been under Greek empires before it was under
the Roman Empire (see Chapters 6 and 7). So, several cities in
Palestine were entirely Greek: Their people, constitutions, build-
ings, customs, and religious practices were all Greek. In fact,
Hellenistic culture had such allure that Greek architectural prac-
tices and styles continued to dominate city-building under Rome
and its local client kings. Herod the Great and his sons built several
major cities, and many of them included the temples, stadiums,
gymnasia, and marketplaces typical of the nearby Greek cities.
One of Herod’s sons, Herod Antipas (who was tetrarch of the
Galilee), built two such cities at Sepphoris and Tiberias. Sepphoris
isn’t far from where Jesus grew up, so some scholars have argued
that Jesus was more influenced by the local Hellenistic culture
than by rural Jewish culture. Because Jesus was a carpenter, some
scholars even think that he may have helped build Sepphoris! But
the gospels never mention Jesus visiting these cities as an adult.
He certainly was exposed to Greek language and culture, but his
primary world was the Jewish world of the rural Galilee.
The pick of the high priest
As I explain earlier in this chapter, Rome didn’t have a large enough
civil service and army to take over direct governance of its empire.
Instead, the emperor relied on the local aristocracy, whose inter-
ests were often similar to Rome’s anyway (they both wanted peace
and stability and the status quo from which they both benefited).
When Rome took over Judea directly in 6 CE and banished Herod
the Great’s son Archelaus, the Roman prefect also took over
Herod’s practice of appointing the high priest directly.
The high priest was supposed to be the purest of the pure, the
single person who represented the Jewish people before their God.
If he was being picked by a pagan who prayed to the Roman God
Jupiter, how could he serve the Jewish God with any integrity?
That’s at least how some Jews saw it. However, the fact that the sit-
uation continued like this from 6–66 CE suggests that the high
priests must have managed the peoples’ sensibilities fairly well.
Chapter 8: Feeling Rome’s Influence 125

At the time of Jesus’s arrest and death (around 30 CE), the high
priest was named Caiaphas, and he had been selected for the post
by the prefect Valerius Gratus in 18 CE. He’s the man whose
Temple police arrested Jesus, and he’s the one who turned Jesus
over to the Roman prefect (Mark 14:33–15:15; Matthew 26:47–27:26;
Luke 22:47–23:25; John 18:2–19:16). The gospels viewed Caiaphas
as a traitor and heretic for turning Jesus over, but given who paid
his salary, it really isn’t that surprising.
The plunder of the Temple treasury
The worst offense against the Jewish people was when a foreign
ruler would rob the Temple treasury to fund his latest military
campaign or public works project. The Jewish people had donated
that money for the service of God! Pontius Pilate even got into
trouble when he pilfered the offerings to build an aqueduct for the
ritual baths and slaughtering floors of the Temple. The people
protested until Pilate’s plainclothes soldiers infiltrated the crowd
and started stabbing them (Josephus, Jewish War 2.9.4; Jewish
Antiquities 18.3.2).
Purifiers and prophets
The period of Roman rule spawned several prophetic figures who
protested Roman presence and sought to purify the land, mostly
after the time of Jesus. Only one appears in the gospels: John the
Baptist. He purified not through ritual baths but with river water.
The river in which he baptized people was the same river that the
Jews passed through when they first conquered their land. In his
gospel, Luke notes that John the Baptist was from a priestly family
but that he wasn’t purifying people through the Jerusalem Temple.
By standing in the river where the nation had been born and wash-
ing people in it, it’s as if he’s calling the people back to their roots
and offering them another way to reconnect with God. The Temple
was the chief place where the nation maintained its relationship
with God, and there’s no evidence that baptized people stopped
going there (take Jesus, for example). But at the same time, John
the Baptist offered a ritual that evoked Jewish heritage at a time
when their land and Temple had been defiled by Rome. For more
about John the Baptist, see Chapter 10.

Exploring the Life 
of Jesus the Jew

In this part . . .
I
n this part, you start working with the records of Jesus’s
life. You explore the stories of his infancy in the Bible and
ﬁnd out whether wise men and shepherds were really pres-
ent at his birth. You also ﬁnd out about Jesus’s brothers and
sisters. You see how we know next to nothing about Jesus’s
childhood and how later Christian authors wrote apoc-
ryphal gospels to ﬁll the gaps. Then you dive into the meat
of the gospels — you see how Jesus’s ministry started, you
meet his close companions, and you follow him as he travels
around the Galilee teaching and doing all kinds of amazing
things. All the while, you’re discovering how to navigate
these gospel stories with the historical “rules of the road” to
arrive at what Jesus may have actually done.

Examining Jesus’s Family
and Early Life
In This Chapter
 Exploring Jesus’s family tree
 Checking out stories of Jesus’s birth and upbringing
 Meeting Jesus’s brothers and sisters
 Hearing the infancy stories that didn’t make it into the Bible
T
he gospel accounts of Jesus’s birth are some of the most well-
known stories of his life, and they’re some of the most beloved.
Every Christmas, families put their manger scenes beneath the tree,
and kids in oversized togas stumble through the streets of Bethlehem
in their school gyms looking for a room in the inn. Carol music in
elevators and shopping malls reminds us of the shepherds and the
three kings so relentlessly that we find ourselves wishing for at
least one silent night before Christmas actually rolls around.
But as familiar as Jesus’s birth story may seem to be, the facts of
his early life are actually quite difficult to establish, and our earliest
sources often give contradictory accounts. So, in this chapter, you
discover what historians think about both the gospel stories and
the later apocryphal tales of Jesus’s family, birth, and childhood.
See Chapter 2 for more information about Jesus’s life according to
the gospels and Chapter 5 for more about the apocryphal sources.
The earliest gospel, the gospel of Mark, doesn’t say a word about
Jesus’s birth or childhood. For some reason, Mark drops readers
right into the middle of Jesus’s life, when he’s about to begin his
ministry. John’s gospel isn’t much help either. He starts “in the
beginning,” but for him that means the beginning of the world!
John then skips right into the story of Jesus’s work as an adult. For
these reasons, you won’t see either Mark’s or John’s gospels pop-
ping up too often in this chapter.

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
130
Beginning with Jesus’s 
Family Background
Before the gospels of Matthew and Luke ever say anything about
Jesus’s birth, they provide a good amount of information on
Jesus’s conception and family background, as you discover in the
following sections. But as you’ll see, little of this information is his-
torically reliable. The gospel authors are composing these stories
to indicate Jesus’s significance. They use
 The literary conventions of royal and divine birth stories to
put Jesus in the company of kings, emperors, and gods
 The Jewish scriptures to provide prophecies of his coming
 Their own artistry to construct overtures to their gospels that
sound all of their major themes
While this may make it sound as if the infancy stories aren’t worth
too much as historical sources, that isn’t quite true. A few ele-
ments are plausible, and even the bits that aren’t likely reveal the
interests of the author and help you distinguish what’s historical
and what’s added throughout the gospel.
Mary, Joseph, and Jesus’s conception
Both the gospel of Matthew and the gospel of Luke note that
Jesus’s parents were Mary and Joseph. Both also narrate that Mary
was engaged but not married to Joseph when she got pregnant.
But the accounts of they discover this startling news differ slightly.
 In Matthew’s gospel, Joseph is so troubled when he finds out
that his fiancée is pregnant that he wants to divorce her (back
then, when two people were engaged, they were in a kind of con-
tract, so a bill of divorce would have been necessary). Because
he’s such a good guy, he wants to break it off quietly rather than
humiliate her in public. But before he can do that, Joseph
receives a revelation in a dream that the pregnancy is God’s
work. The angel that delivers this revelation also says that this
unusual birth fulfills Isaiah’s prophecy that “the virgin will be
with child and bear a son, and they shall name him Immanuel,
which means ‘God with us’” (in the Greek version of Isaiah
7:14; Matthew 1:18–25). Calmed by the angel’s message,
Joseph goes through with the marriage. To confirm that the
child isn’t Joseph’s, the author says that Joseph didn’t have
relations with Mary until after Jesus was born (Matthew 1:25).

Chapter 9: Examining Jesus's Family and Early Life 131
 Luke’s gospel also portrays Mary as a virgin when she con-
ceives Jesus. But this time, the angel comes to her (rather than
Joseph), and tells her of God’s plan before the conception. Like
Joseph (and perhaps with even greater reason!), she’s upset 
and wonders how in the world she could be pregnant; after all,
she knows that she has never slept with a man. But the angel
reassures her that God’s behind it. Mary consents, saying, “May
it be done to me according to your word” (Luke 1:26–38).
How much of this information is historical? Well, think of it this
way: Historians call things facts only if they can be proven (flip to
Chapter 3 for the historian working rules). The gospel accounts
corroborate Jesus’s parents’ names and the unusual circumstances
of his conception. But beyond that, you can’t really demonstrate
the virginal conception and the role of God in Jesus’s birth.
However, this doesn’t mean that these events didn’t happen or
don’t signify anything; it simply means that they can’t be proven.
What is historical, on the other hand, is that the authors of
Matthew and Luke wanted to communicate something through
these details. They tried to explain Jesus’s unique nature, and the
stories of the virginal conception were the best ways to articulate
what they believed (that Jesus was the son of God and the heir to
the promises to David).
Jesus’s connection to past generations
The gospels of Matthew and Luke expand beyond Jesus’s parents
and offer family trees for Joseph. The two genealogies differ a lot
from each other, but one of the things that they agree on is that
Joseph the carpenter?
Many people think that Jesus’s father, Joseph, was a carpenter, but the truth is that
carpentry was probably Jesus’s trade. Mark’s gospel says that Jesus’s acquain-
tances took offense to his teaching and asked each other, “Where did this guy get
all this [teaching]? What is the wisdom that’s been given to him and these deeds of
power being done through his hands? Isn’t this guy the carpenter, the son of Mary
and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters
here with us?” (Mark 6:2–3).
When Matthew edited Mark’s gospel into his own, he changed this text. He appar-
ently was sensitive to the fact that Jesus would be insulted in this way and that the
father of Jesus was mentioned nowhere. In his gospel, Matthew notes the people
of Nazareth saying, “Isn’t this guy the son of the carpenter?” (Matthew 13:54–55).
And from that point on, Joseph became a carpenter.

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
132
Joseph is a descendent of David, one of the great kings of the past
(Matthew 1:20; Luke 1:27, 32–33; Paul agrees with this tradition in
Romans 1:3). This claim is important to know because God had
promised David that he would always have a descendent on the
throne (2 Samuel 7:8–16). This promise was the root of some Jews’
hopes in the first century that God would fulfill the promise
through an anointed one (messiah in Hebrew and christos in Greek).
When the two gospels include David in the genealogy, what they’re
saying is that Jesus is the promised Davidic messiah. (See Chapter
7 for more on messianic speculation.)
Because Matthew and Luke make it quite clear that Joseph had
nothing to do with Jesus’s conception, it may seem strange to hear
them claim that Jesus is a descendent of David through Joseph. It
sounds odd because people today tend to think biologically,
whereas Matthew and Luke thought theologically. For them, Jesus
is human and has a unique relationship to God, which obviously
isn’t a biological claim (try testing for that in a modern lab!). So,
the best way they can express this mystery is through a virginal
mother (to explain his relationship with God). The gospels can still
call Joseph Jesus’s father because in that time, as long as a man
agreed to raise a child, that child was considered his legitimate
descendent — even if there was no biological relation.
Jesus’s link to David and the messianic promise is especially clear
in Matthew’s genealogy at the opening of his gospel (Matthew
1:1–17). Now, I know what you’re thinking: Genealogies have to be
the most boring things to read — how long can you stay interested
with “Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob,” and so on for
more than 30 generations?
But remember that genealogies are the original Bible code, which
makes them a lot more interesting than they appear. To crack the
code and discover what the authors are trying to reveal about who
Jesus is, you want to look at the structure of the genealogies and
the people whom the author chooses to include. I give you clues
on how to do this in the following sections.
Adding up Matthew’s numbers and scanning his names
Matthew breaks his genealogy into three parts of 14. He includes
14 generations from Abraham (the first patriarch of the Jews) to
the great King David; 14 generations from David to the Babylonian
Exile (when the Davidic line was exterminated); and 14 generations
from the exile to Jesus (Matthew 1:17).
If you break each group of 14 into two parts, Jesus is at the head of
the seventh set of seven generations. Seven is one of those sym-
bolic numbers, representing completion or fulfillment (think seven
days in a week). That means that Jesus stands at the moment when
history itself will be fulfilled.

So if the point is seven sevens, why does Matthew group the gener-
ations in 14s? Well, this is where it really gets interesting. The
Hebrew language uses the letters of its alphabet to do double duty
as numbers (there were no “Arabic numerals” yet). So, you can
actually “count” the letters of Hebrew words and come up with a
sum. Guess whose name adds up to 14? David! It’s like the mes-
sianic promise is embedded in Jesus’s gene pool.
The number 14 obviously matters to Matthew because in the
second set of 14, he even leaves out four kings of Judah catalogued
in the earlier biblical book of 1 Chronicles in order to get the magic
number (1 Chronicles 3:10–12 adds Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah
after Joram, and adds Jehoiakim after Joash; compare that to
Matthew 1:1–17). Historical accuracy is less important to him than
the Davidic framework of Jesus’s family tree.
The names in Matthew’s genealogy are a kind of code, too. For 
example, Matthew adds the names of five mothers alongside the
names of their partners. What all these women (including Mary)
have in common is that every one of them hooked up with her part-
ner in an unusual way. (Check out the nearby sidebar “The women
in Matthew’s genealogy” for more information on these gals.)
Chapter 9: Examining Jesus's Family and Early Life 133
The women in Matthew’s genealogy
Five women became a part of Matthew’s version of Jesus’s family tree under some-
what unusual circumstances:
 Tamar married Judah’s first son. When that man died, Judah sent his second
son to her so they could conceive a child for the dead man (a tradition called
“levirate marriage”). When the second son died too, Judah decided not to risk
his third son, even though the law said he should. So Tamar tricked Judah into
sleeping with her himself so that she could conceive a child for her first husband
(Genesis 38).
 Rahab was a Canaanite prostitute who enabled Jewish spies to sneak into
Jericho and thus conquer it (Joshua 2).
 Ruth was a Gentile, Moabite woman, whose fidelity to her Jewish mother-in-
law attracted positive attention from a Jewish male relative named Boaz (Ruth
1–4).
 David had his way with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, and then when she wound
up pregnant, he made sure that Uriah would die on the battlefield so that he
could take Bathsheba as one of his many wives and pretend that she had con-
ceived legitimately (2 Samuel 11–12).
 Mary conceives Jesus “by the holy spirit” rather than by Joseph (Matthew
1:18–25).

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
134
Comparing Luke’s list to Matthew’s list
Luke’s genealogy (Luke 3:23–37) is completely different than
Matthew’s. There are no references to the number 14 and there are
no women (sorry gals!). Luke has 56 generations to Matthew’s 41.
Here’s another important difference: Instead of tracing Jesus to
Abraham like Matthew does, Luke traces Jesus to Adam, the first
man. Luke’s arrangement of the family tree shows how Jesus is sig-
nificant for the whole human race. Matthew, on the other hand,
wants to make clear that Jesus is the promised messiah of Israel.
So which one of these lists is historical? Actually, it’s unlikely that
either one is accurate. When your two chief witnesses diverge from
each other so much and differ from earlier Jewish records, it
becomes difficult to determine which one, if any, is true. However,
the authors aren’t really organizing these family trees in order to
give a history lesson. They want to use these lists to show who
Jesus is, why he’s significant, and whom he has come to save.
Calculating the dates of Jesus’s
conception and birth
In 527 CE, a Roman abbot named Dionysius Exiguus calculated that Jesus had been
conceived on March 25 in the 754th year after the founding of the city of Rome (ab
urbe condita, or AUC, which means “from the founding of the city”). By that point,
Christians controlled the western calendar, so they changed the all-important “year
1” from the date of Rome’s founding to the date of Jesus’s conception, and 754 AUC
became 1 AD (anno domini, “year of the Lord”). Years “before Christ” were desig-
nated with BC.
However, because the Roman calendars that the abbot was using were a bit incon-
sistent, he actually got the date wrong. We now know that Herod the Great died in
4 BCE, so if Matthew and Luke were right that Jesus was born during Herod’s reign
(Matthew 2; Luke 1:5), Jesus was actually born four years before Christ!
The March 25 incarnation date was selected so that Jesus’s birth nine months later
would fall near the winter solstice, when the days begin to lengthen. The reason for
this placement is biblical rather than historical: John’s gospel reports John the
Baptist’s final words to be, “He [Jesus] must increase, I must decrease” (John 3:30).
So, Christians set Jesus’s nativity on the day that the light begins to increase in the
world and John the Baptist’s feast on June 24, near the summer solstice, when the
days begin to shorten (see also John 1:3–9 and Luke 1:36).

Delving into Jesus’s Birth 
and Childhood
The gospels of Matthew and Luke have some similarities in telling
the story of Jesus’s birth and childhood. However, they also differ
on the details of some important events, such as why Jesus was
born in Bethlehem, and they frame the story of Jesus’s birth in
completely different ways, as you find out in the following sections.
Jesus’s birthplace and hometown
Both Matthew and Luke agree that Jesus was born in Bethlehem,
which is in Judea, near Jerusalem (where David was from and
therefore where David’s heir was expected to be born; see Micah
5:1). Both of these gospel authors also agree that Jesus grew up in a
little hick town called Nazareth, which is in the northern part of the
country (the Galilee). It’s somewhat embarrassing for Jesus to have
grown up here because it really was “Nowheresville,” and in that time
people expected the famous to come from somewhere famous.
Even though the gospels have these few similarities, they differ
otherwise. For instance, consider this important set of differences
regarding why Jesus was born in Bethlehem:
 The gospel of Matthew gives the impression that Mary and
Joseph have always lived in Bethlehem, and that’s why Jesus
was born there. And, according to the author of Matthew, the
reason that the family ends up in Nazareth is because the
southern Herods are so dangerous.
 The gospel of Luke, by contrast, says Mary and Joseph lived
in Nazareth all along, went down to Bethlehem only because
the Roman Emperor decreed that everyone return to their
ancestral birthplaces to enroll in a census, and returned home
after Jesus’s birth.
Out of all these hometown and birthplace details, the Nazareth
connection seems to be the most reliable piece of evidence to his-
torians because Matthew and Luke both report it, and they do so
even though it’s potentially embarrassing to Jesus. In fact, most
scholars think that Nazareth is probably where Jesus was born,
too, because outside the infancy narratives in Matthew and Luke,
all four gospels presume that he’s a Galilean or Nazarene (see Mark
1:9 and 6:1; John 1:45–56 and 7:41–42; Matthew 13:54, 57; Luke 4:16,
23–24). On top of that, the Bethlehem link clearly serves the purpose
of painting Jesus as the promised messiah, which naturally raises
historians’ suspicions about the historical accuracy of the claim.

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
136
The nativity stories
The differences between Matthew and Luke continue in the birth
stories. In fact, about the only detail that the two gospels have in
common is that Jesus was born in Bethlehem. Apart from that, they
each have different ways of signifying who Jesus was. Matthew
focuses on Jesus’s political identity as the true king of the Jews, and
Luke emphasizes how Jesus is the savior of the entire world. I explain
both nativity stories in the following sections.
Matthew’s story: Fright and flight
In Matthew’s account of the nativity story (Matthew 2:1–23), a star
in the heavens attracts the attention of some astrologers from the
east (see the nearby sidebar, “Wise men from the east,” for more
about these guys). The Persians, Medes, and Babylonians were
well-known in the ancient world for their skills at astrology and
dream interpretation. Because it was also a common belief that
heavenly signs accompanied the births of great kings, the author of
Matthew includes such a story.
Landing in Jerusalem, the astrologers (who are also known as the
Magi, from the Greek magoi or “magician”) went straight to the palace
of King Herod the Great (flip to Chapters 7 and 8 for background on
him). They presumed that if a little prince had been born, he must be
the son of the current king. Only Herod had no newborn, and he was
none too happy to hear that a rival claimant to his throne had been
born! Feigning interest in the child, he asked the Magi to return to
him after they had found the boy (whom he secretly planned to kill).
When the Magi got wind of Herod’s plan through a dream, they went
home by a different route. The enraged king then slaughtered all the
boys who were less than 2 years old.
Luckily, thanks to another timely revelatory dream for Joseph, the
holy family escaped the angry Herod in the nick of time and fled to
Egypt (I discuss some apocryphal legends about this escape later
in this chapter). The family stayed there until Joseph learned in a
final dream that it was safe to return (talk about instant messag-
ing!). All in all, it’s a pretty bloody and terrifying story — not the
version pictured on your average Hallmark Christmas card.
Luke’s account: Silent night
In Luke’s nativity story (Luke 2:1–20), Jesus is born in a stable and
placed in a humble feeding trough, with animals all around — no
hint of kings and wise men and expensive gifts here! In fact, Jesus’s
only visitors in Luke’s account were shepherds — not exactly your
most lucrative profession in antiquity. However, the scene is idyllic
and peaceful, with angels singing in the heavens. It couldn’t be
more different from Matthew’s frightening and eventful version.

Luke’s account also is unique in that he stages the entire birth story
as two parallel plots comparing Jesus and John the Baptist. John’s
birth is announced first (Luke 1:5–25), and then Jesus’s (Luke 1:26–38).
John’s birth, circumcision, and young life are recounted (Luke
1:57–80), and then Jesus’s nativity, circumcision, and youth are nar-
rated (Luke 2:1–21). At the center of these paired stories is an
encounter between Elizabeth, the mother of John, and Mary, the
mother of Jesus (Luke 1:39–56), whom the author presents as rela-
tives (Luke 1:36). Historically speaking, it’s unlikely that Mary and
Elizabeth were related. Only one gospel narrates it, for starters.
But more importantly, the whole narrative is heavily designed to
make Jesus’s connection with and superiority to John clear (see
Chapter 10 for the gospel authors’ sensitivity about this issue). It
looks as if that need rather than history is controlling the account.
Comparing the messages
Matthew’s plot focuses on the clash between King Jesus and King
Herod. The following details show that Jesus, not Herod, is the true
heir to the throne:
Chapter 9: Examining Jesus's Family and Early Life 137
Wise men from the east
Matthew’s gospel mentions that astrologers from the east visit Jesus in Bethlehem
(Matthew 2:1–12). These men saw an unusual star to their west and traveled to its
source, believing that a new king had been born.
Matthew’s gospel doesn’t say how many wise men visited, and it doesn’t call them
kings. The Eastern Orthodox tradition thought it was 12 Magi, but in the Western
Church it was only 3 Magi, probably based on the assumption that because there
were three gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, there were three men. These three
Magi became kings by virtue of other Bible verses that were thought to allude to
this event, such as Psalm 72:10–11, which says, “The kings of Tarshish and of the
Isles will bring tribute; the kings of Sheba and Seba will bring gifts; all kings will pay
him homage; all peoples will serve him.”
By the seventh and eighth centuries, the kings who had visited Jesus had names
and races. The kingly gift of gold came from the old, white King Melchior; the priestly
gift of fragrant frankincense came from the clean-shaven, young, and ruddy-faced
Caspar (or Gaspar); the myrrh, a medicinal and burial ointment, came from the dark,
heavily bearded Balthasar.
Even though this event is widely known among Christians, it’s unlikely that it actu-
ally happened; it’s quite implausible and it’s reported in only one gospel. But once
again, what’s more important than its historicity is its symbolism: The author of
Matthew’s gospel uses the story to tell readers that Jesus, the King of the Jews,
will be King of the Gentiles as well — a messiah not just for Judea but for the world.
And these Gentiles “got it,” while King Herod didn’t.

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
138
 The groups of 14 in the genealogy (flip to “Jesus’s connection
to past generations” earlier in this chapter)
 The Bethlehem birth
 The sign of the star resting over Jesus’s birthplace rather than
Herod’s palace
 Herod’s reaction to the threat
And to top it all off, Herod wasn’t even a Davidic descendent; in fact,
he was only a second-generation convert to Judaism and a close col-
laborator with Roman occupation forces (Chapters 7 and 8 tell that
story). So, it was pretty easy to challenge his rule.
Luke’s plot, on the other hand, focuses on the struggle between the
humble savior and the powerful Roman emperor. Jesus may be a
Davidic descendent, but this king was born in a rural backwater to
a poor teenager. Luke contrasts these modest origins to the Roman
Emperor Augustus, who annexes Judea and throws his weight
around, enrolling everybody so that he can tax them while claim-
ing to be their savior. However, while Augustus is certainly more
powerful than Jesus, the author of Luke’s gospel presents Jesus as
the true savior of the world. Because God’s power to lift the lowly
is at work in him, he is more powerful than the Roman emperor.
What’s historical when it comes to the nativity stories? Very little.
The star at Jesus’s birth in Matthew’s gospel clearly fulfills a Jewish
messianic prophecy that “a star will advance from Jacob and a
scepter will arise from Israel” (Numbers 24:17). That leads historians
to be suspicious that scripture rather than a historical event has
spawned the gospel account. Herod did kill some of his own children,
but there’s no record outside Matthew’s gospel that he killed all of
his subjects’ sons under 2 years old. Also, Herod died in 4 BCE, and
the census Luke mentions didn’t occur until 6 CE, so both details
can’t be true. The infancy accounts are like overtures to the gospel
symphony: They set up the main themes about Jesus that the authors
wanted to convey. They’re theological words (or theologoumena)
rather than historical words; they’re meant to convey the deep 
significance of Jesus, not simply the shallow facts.
The escape to Egypt
Matthew adds a story unique to his gospel about how the holy
family escapes Herod’s slaughter of the baby boys by rushing off to
Egypt and hanging out there for a couple of years, until Herod the
Great dies (see the earlier section “Matthew’s story: Fright and
flight”). We don’t hear a thing about what happens during those
years. All that seems to matter to Matthew is that the holy family is
exiled in Egypt for a time, and then is able to return home.

Matthew uses this vignette not so much to narrate the details of
Jesus’s infancy, but to declare who he thinks Jesus is. In this short
story, for example, Jesus relives the experiences of the Jewish
people. They had been in Egypt and then they were freed from a
cruel king to enter a covenant and a land that had been promised
by God (Exodus through Joshua). The Jewish people had also suf-
fered the Babylonian Exile, when their leaders were taken to a for-
eign land as slaves, only to return to the Promised Land several
decades later (Isaiah 45–66; Ezra through Nehemiah). Jesus relives
this exile as well — and all as a toddler! This story is Matthew’s
way of saying that Jesus fulfills Jewish hopes.
Did these events really happen? Historians tend to be skeptical when a
story is so saturated with allusions to prior stories and biblical heroes.
Jesus’s upbringing
Only Luke reports on Jesus’s childhood, and even then, it isn’t
much. One description that Luke includes is that Jesus “grew and
became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon
him” (Luke 2:40).
Luke also mentions that, at age 12, Jesus was accidentally left behind
by his parents when they were visiting Jerusalem for the Passover
festival (Luke 2:41–52). When they returned to Jerusalem to search
for him, they found him in the Jewish Temple, teaching the teachers!
The source of his wisdom became a little clearer when he responded
to his mother, “Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s
house?” It’s his special relationship to God, his “father,” that gives
him his unique and extraordinary wisdom.
Few scholars think that this event is historical. After all, Luke is the
only witness, and the story is contrived to demonstrate that
Jesus’s unique wisdom comes from his special relationship to God.
Chronicling Jesus’s Brothers 
and Sisters
We never hear about any brothers and sisters of Jesus in the
infancy narratives that I describe earlier in this chapter. There is,
however, one oblique reference that Joseph didn’t have sex with
Mary until Jesus was born (Matthew 1:25). That doesn’t prove that
they had additional children after Jesus. However, regular refer-
ences to the brothers and even the sisters of Jesus are scattered
throughout the New Testament, and the simplest way to under-
stand these references is that these children were born to Joseph

140
and Mary. It’s only later, with the developing teaching on the per-
petual virginity of Mary, that the presence of these brothers and
sisters will become problematic (see the later section “Developing
the doctrine of the Virgin Mary”).
James, the most prominent brother
The earliest reference to a sibling of Jesus is in the apostle Paul’s let-
ters, which date to about 20–30 years after Jesus’s death. Paul men-
tions one of Jesus’s brothers, James, and indicates that he’s a major
leader of the Jerusalem Christian community (Galatians 1:18–2:14; 
1 Corinthians 9:4–5; 15:7). It’s also clear that Paul disagrees deeply
with James. Paul doesn’t think that new Christians should have to
follow the Jewish law regarding such things as circumcision and
dietary laws, and James apparently does.
Acts of the Apostles, written a couple of decades after Paul, reports
that Jesus’s family was part of the earliest post-resurrection commu-
nity (Acts 1:14) and features James as the leader of the Jerusalem
Church (Acts 12:17; 15:13–21; 21:17–26). It suggests that Paul and
James came to an agreement about the Jewish law.
The first-century Jewish historian Josephus also mentions James.
He explains that Ananus, a rash man whom the Roman procurator
Albinus had foolishly appointed high priest, did the following:
[He assembled] the Sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the
brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and
some others, and when he had formed an accusation against them as
breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned.
—Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 20.9.1
According to Josephus, the Jerusalem Jews were upset by the exe-
cution of James in 62 CE because they didn’t think the act was just.
So, Josephus corroborates that Jesus had a brother named James
who was well-known in Jerusalem for his piety.
Marginalizing the brothers 
and sisters in the gospels
When the gospel authors sat down to write their gospels, the
brothers and sisters of Jesus were barely mentioned. In fact, in
Mark’s gospel, Jesus’s relatives are presented quite negatively. For
instance, when Jesus returns home and is surrounded by crowds,
they come to seize him because they think he’s lost his mind (Mark
3:20–21). And when his mother and brothers (and sisters, in some

Chapter 9: Examining Jesus's Family and Early Life 141
The bone box of James: 
A hoax or the real McCoy?
In October 2002, the magazine Biblical Archaeology Review announced that a stone
bone box (also called an ossuary), which was owned by Oded Golan, a private Israeli
collector, had once contained the bones of James, the brother of Jesus. The box
had an Aramaic inscription on the side that said, “James, son of Joseph, brother of
Jesus.” (The figure here shows some bone boxes from the same time with fancier
decoration and lids than the simple, flat-topped ossuary of James.) There was great
excitement over this ossuary because there are so few genuine physical artifacts
from the first century that correlate to details in the gospels. People thought this
might be the real McCoy, even though the names James, Joseph, and Jesus were
so common that this cluster could have applied to many men at any given time in the
first century.

But the bone box soon proved to be a hoax. The box itself was definitely a first-century
ossuary. But the inscription “brother of Jesus” appears to be written in an entirely
different hand. Even more incriminating was the fact that the collector had engraving
tools in his home as well as materials to add a patina (a coating of dust and organic
material) to the inscription to make it look like it had been inscribed long ago. In 2003,
the Israel Antiquities Authority appointed 14 scholars to determine the authenticity of
the artifact, and 13 of them declared it a hoax.

early manuscripts) arrive they stand outside (Mark 3:31–32;
Matthew 12:46–47; Luke 8:20). When he’s told that they are there:
[Jesus] said to them in reply, “Who are my mother and
brothers?” And looking around at those seated in the circle he
said, “Here are my mother and my brothers. Whoever does the
will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”
—Mark 3:31–35
Ouch! Why is Jesus’s family portrayed so badly? It may be because
they came to believe in Jesus only after the resurrection, not during
the tougher times of his life. The gospel of John says outright that
“his brothers did not believe in him” (John 7:1–13) and transfers
responsibility for Mary’s care from Jesus to the unnamed “beloved
disciple” at the foot of the cross, as if the brothers no longer existed
(John 19:26–27)!
Matthew and Luke clean up the family feud in their gospels. If you
read their accounts of Jesus’s interactions with his brothers,
there’s barely a hint of sibling rivalry.
 In Matthew 13:54–58, the only thing reported is the view of the
Nazareth villagers, that Jesus is “just” Mary and the carpenter’s
son, the brother of James, Joseph (Joses in the gospel of Mark),
Simon, Judas, and of some unnamed sisters. The closest the
author comes to criticizing the brothers is to keep part of
Jesus’s rebuke from Mark’s gospel: “A prophet is not without
honor except in his native place and in his own house” (Mark
6:4 also says “among his own kin,” which Matthew drops).
 The author of the gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles
cleans up the family feud even more. Mary is portrayed very
positively (Luke 1–2), Jesus’s rebuke about his rejection doesn’t
mention his kin or his house (Luke 4:24), and Mary and the
brothers seem to be among Jesus’s followers, especially after
the resurrection (Luke 8:19–21; Acts 1:14).
The differences over the role of Jesus’s brothers may indicate political
disputes in the early Church. By the time the gospels were penned,
the Jewish form of Christianity that James represented had fallen
out of favor, the Christian community in Jerusalem had dispersed
under persecution, and Jerusalem itself had been destroyed. The
Jerusalem community, and the kind of Christian faith James advo-
cated, had become a distant memory, replaced by the teaching of
other apostles in distant communities. Still, the memory of the
brothers’ early roles remained powerful enough that the Letters of
James and Jude made it into the New Testament because people
thought they could be traced to Jesus’s brothers.

Filling the Gaps in Jesus’s Early
Life in Later Centuries
As the gospels began to circulate in the late first and early second
centuries, inquiring minds wanted to know more about some of the
gaps in the tales of Jesus’s infancy and childhood. Were his divine
powers apparent as a child? And what was Jesus’s childhood like?
They began to tell stories, and some of them, namely the apocryphal
texts in the following sections, have survived.
These apocryphal infancy tales were written after the gospels to
address developing beliefs and to entertain curious minds. The
stories are sometimes appalling, infrequently edifying, and always
entertaining. It isn’t too difficult to see why they didn’t make the
cut when Christians were binding their Bibles. And in terms of
their historical value, it’s basically nil — they’re too late and too
dependent on prior gospels, legendary additions, and later beliefs.
Developing the doctrine 
of the Virgin Mary
A gospel called the Protvogospel of James began to circulate in the
mid-second century. This story is mostly about what happened
before Jesus’s adult life (hence the prefix “proto” or “first” gospel).
Chapter 9: Examining Jesus's Family and Early Life 143
Debunking the myth of Jesus’s family tomb
In March of 2007, the Discovery Channel (US), Vision Canada, and C4/UK aired a film
titled The Lost Tomb of Jesus, which was produced by Oscar winner James
Cameron (Titanic) and directed by journalist Simcha Jacobovici. The film features
details of ten bone boxes (or ossuaries) that were discovered in a tomb in 1980,
during the excavation for a condo complex in East Talpiyot, south of Jerusalem. Six
of the bone boxes bear the inscribed names of the persons whose bones used to be
inside: Yeshua (Jesus) son of Yehosef (Joseph), Marya (Mary), Matya (Matthew),
Yosah (not Yoseh or Jose, as the filmmakers claim), Yehuda (Judas) son of Yeshua
(Jesus), and “[remains] of Mariamne also called Mara” (or possibly “of Mariamne
and Martha”).
Cameron and Jacobovici used statistics, DNA sampling, and other forensic techniques
to argue that there’s a 1 in 600 chance that the names found on the inscriptions weren’t
the family of Jesus. While each name is extremely common, the film argues that it’s the 
continued

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
144
combination of these particular names that’s decisive. Statistics sound impressive,
but if they’re based on faulty assumptions, they lose all their power. And there are
at least three faulty assumptions at work here:
 That Jesus’s poor family from Nazareth could have afforded a nice family tomb
and would have built it so far away from home: Only the wealthy could afford
rock-cut tombs and reburials in ossuaries. The poor, by contrast, were usually
buried in trench graves, like those we dig today. On the rare occasions that
someone was buried away from their home turf, their place of origin was usu-
ally inscribed on the ossuary, but none of the ossuaries in the Talpiyot tomb bear
such inscriptions. This grave was for a well-off Judean clan, not the relatives
of a poor man from Nazareth.
 That Mariamne refers to Mary Magdalene: Cameron and Jacobovici reach
ahead three centuries to the apocryphal Acts of Philip to find a reference to a
woman that’s spelled “Mariamne.” But in the Acts of Philip, she’s Mary the sister
of Martha (see Luke 10:39; John 11:2, 12:3), not Mary from Magdala. The gospels,
written in Greek, always call that Mary “Maria [or Mariam] the Magdalene”
rather than “Mariamene” or “Mariamne.” Quite frankly, the 1st-century gospels
are more likely to have the name right than a 4th-century text that was written
in Asia Minor and survives only in a 14th-century copy. The filmmakers take
“Mariamne” as a unique spelling that’s only ever been used of Mary
Magdalene. But it was a common Greek spelling of the name Mary; it’s spelled
this way on at least 20 other known ossuaries in Israel. And despite how
common it is, it’s never used of Mary Magdalene, even in the Acts of Philip.
 That the bone box of “James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus,” publicized by
Jacobovici (and others) in 2002, came from this tomb: It’s true that there was a
tenth ossuary found during the excavation of the Talpiyot tomb in 1980 that has
since been misplaced. But Amos Kloner, the archaeologist who excavated the
Talpiyot tomb and actually saw the tenth ossuary, reported that it wasn’t
inscribed. As for the bone box of James, the origin of that box is unknown
because it was bought on the antiquities market. And, in fact, the part of the
inscription reading “brother of Jesus” was most likely a recent addition (see
the earlier sidebar “The bone box of James: A hoax or the real McCoy?”).
The idea that Mariamne is Jesus’s wife is based on two arguments: DNA testing of
residue found in Jesus’s and Mariamne’s ossuaries revealed that the individuals
didn’t share a mother, and if they aren’t maternally related, they must be married.
Because this tomb was plundered in antiquity and anybody’s DNA could have found
its way in there, we have no proof that the residue in the ossuary is from the bones
buried there. Plus, just because two people don’t share a mother doesn’t guaran-
tee that they’re married! They could be a stepbrother and stepsister, aunt and
nephew (through her brother), and so on.
Apart from the problems with the statistics and other assumptions, it doesn’t help
the movie’s premise that the Jesus ossuary is the least decorated and that the name
is scratched in pretty hastily, while the ossuaries of Judas (Jesus’s son) and
Mariamne are very carefully inscribed and decorated. Wouldn’t you expect Jesus’s
ossuary to be the nicest?

So, the plot is really more about Mary than it is about Jesus. By
this point in time, the belief that Jesus was divine had developed
to such a degree that his birth from a human mother had become
difficult to explain. The divine was thought to be immaterial, eter-
nal, and uncorruptible, so people wondered how a divine child
could come to life in a material, temporal, and corruptible woman.
The Protogospel of James put people’s minds at ease with its story
of Mary’s life and Jesus’s birth. According to this gospel, for exam-
ple, Mary had been conceived without sin by her barren mother,
Hannah. Grateful that her prayer for a child had been answered,
Hannah made the baby’s room a little sanctuary so that the infant
would remain pure, and then she shipped little Mary off to the
Jerusalem Temple so that the priests could protect her sanctity.
As menstruation approached, however, the priests knew she 
couldn’t remain at the Temple (flip to Chapter 7 for purity rules at
the Temple). So, they sought an appropriate husband. When the
old man Joseph appeared with his adult sons, a dove landed on 
his walking staff, marking him as God’s choice for Mary. (In later
iconography, it bloomed with flowers instead, as people combined
this story with the account of the great priest Aaron’s flowering
staff in Numbers 17:16–26.) Then Mary became pregnant miracu-
lously and, finding a cave, gave birth to Jesus in a flash of light.
What follows is one of the most curious scenes in Christian litera-
ture: The attending midwife attempted to insert her finger into
Mary’s vagina to test whether her hymen had been broken by the
birth (of course it had never been broken in intercourse either).
The midwife’s hand then burst into flame until she repented her
sin of putting God to the test.
This story, unlike the Biblical gospels, explains that Mary miracu-
lously remains a virgin through the birth process and then through
the rest of her life. After all, Joseph is too old to want sex, and he
already has sons from a prior marriage. Even though this story
never made it into the Bible, it has been popular in Christian tradi-
tion and art for 1,800 years. The “perpetual virginity of Mary” also
remains the official teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, which
treats both scripture and subsequent tradition as expressions of
divine revelation.
Describing Jesus’s infancy in Egypt
Matthew’s gospel reports that Jesus’s family spent some time in
Egypt until it was safe to return to Palestine (see the earlier sec-
tion, “The escape to Egypt,” for more information). Early Christians
wondered what life was like for the family while they were there.
Chapter 9: Examining Jesus's Family and Early Life 145

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
146
The Arabic Infancy Gospel fills in that gap in the sixth century CE.
According to this gospel, when the family arrived in Egypt, the
chief Egyptian idol announced that God had entered the country,
and then it promptly destroyed itself. As the holy family traveled
through the country, every town had some demoniac or mute
bride or leper or impotent bridegroom who was cured by kissing
the baby Jesus or touching his bathwater. This tradition displays a
common tendency in the apocryphal gospels to take details from
gospel accounts of the adult Jesus and write them back into his
infancy.
Portraying a powerful child
The Arabic Infancy Gospel tells similar tales of Jesus’s childhood in
Nazareth: Lepers are cured, dead children are raised, and petition-
ers bathe in Jesus’s bathwater.
In this gospel, as well as in the much earlier Infancy Gospel of
Thomas on which it is based (mid-second century CE), the story
gets even more interesting as Jesus gets older. For instance:
 Jesus molds animals and birds out of clay and makes them
come to life (see Genesis 2:7; the Qur’an picks up this story in
5:110).
 He tags along on Joseph’s carpentry calls and fixes all his
dad’s mistakes.
 Playmates run away from him, and so Jesus turns them into
sheep so he can play as if he’s their shepherd.
 He resurrects a dead boy to avoid blame for the boy’s death.
In this story, Jesus’s playmate falls from the roof and dies. The
boy’s parents blame Jesus, so he resurrects the dead boy long
enough to get himself off the hook.
Later in the gospel, things take a darker turn. It seems that every-
one who bothers the powerful child lives to regret it, if indeed they
live at all. A would-be bully is struck dead. Adults who accuse him
are blinded. A harsh teacher flogs young Jesus, and he’s toast At
that point, Mary and Joseph decide to home-school Jesus, until he
sneaks out and wows the Jerusalem teachers at age 12 (this one
detail corresponds to the earlier account in Luke 2:41–52, which
the author certainly knew). But, when he reaches adolescence, he
realizes that he must hide his powers until he can manage them
properly as an adult.

T
he historical Jesus emerged from the anonymity of his Galilean
hometown sometime in the late 20s CE. Trained as a wood-
worker, he left his family and trade behind in Nazareth and arrived
on the banks of the Jordan River to be washed by the charismatic
prophet and purifier, John the Baptist. That moment in the gospels
marks his first public step as the leader of a new movement.
In this chapter, you join Jesus at the Jordan and in the desert,
follow him around the Sea of Galilee as he gathers a band of sup-
porters, and watch him meet with all the wrong kinds of people.
Meeting John the Baptist
All four gospels tell the story of a man named John who began to
baptize people in the Jordan River. Luke 3:1 adds that his ministry
began in the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius (approxi-
mately 28/29 CE). In the gospels of Mark and Matthew, Jesus is one
of the people he baptizes. Given its location at the inauguration of
Jesus’s mission, the story of the baptism introduces important ideas
about who the gospel authors believe Jesus is — and who John the
Baptist is, too.
Rinsing off sins in the river
Many Jewish people in the time of Jesus washed themselves ritually
in special baths that cleansed them from typical activities or occur-
rences that were believed to defile a person. Such activities included
ejaculation, menstruation, childbirth, or preparing a corpse for

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
148
burial. There was nothing wrong with these activities at all; folks
simply needed to wash and wait a period of time to purify them-
selves afterward. And as far as we can tell, they needed to purify
themselves after some of these activities only if they were going to
the Temple (Chapter 7 has more on these purity practices).
John’s baptisms as reported in the gospels are similar to these
purifying baths, but also different. How? Consider these features:
 John’s baptisms didn’t cleanse you from the normal human
defilements but instead represented your repentance and com-
mitment to a conversion or change of lifestyle (some other
Jewish groups may have understood their ritual baths in this
way, like the people who compiled the Dead Sea Scrolls).
 You didn’t dunk yourself (the Greek verb baptidzo means “to
dip or dunk”), which you would do in the ritual baths; instead
you had to seek out John and his companions to do it.
 John’s baptism occurred at the Jordan River out in the 
wilderness — not in the ritual baths that dotted Jewish villages.
Baptism was an unusual thing to do at the time, but it was appar-
ently so characteristic of John that he’s called “the baptizer” by
the gospel authors and by Josephus, a contemporary Jewish histo-
rian (see the later sidebar, “Josephus’s account of John the
Baptist,” for more information). Jesus and the movement that fol-
lowed him picked up the baptism practice from John. By the time
the gospels were written, the early Christians were speaking of two
baptisms: the baptism of water practiced by John and the baptism
by the Holy Spirit/fire practiced in Jesus’s name (Mark 1:8;
Matthew 3:11; Luke 3:16; John 1:26–27, 33).
The fact that Jesus needed something from John (rather than the
other way around) was a little awkward for the gospel authors. To
them, it raised questions: Does this mean that John is the greater
guy, because Jesus comes to him to be baptized? Does it mean that
John is the greater guy because he’s the first to baptize? Does it
mean that he’s greater because Jesus’s teachings echo his?
Each of the gospels solves these problems by making John less sig-
nificant than Jesus. Jesus’s significance is crystal clear when he
rises from the water in Mark, Matthew, and Luke’s gospels and the
heavenly voice declares, “This is my beloved son,” meaning Jesus
of course, not John (Mark 1:10–11; Matthew 3:16–17; Luke 3:21–22).
In the gospel of John, the Baptist never baptizes Jesus. However,
he does testify to him, calling him:
 “The one whose sandal strap I am unworthy to untie” (John
1:27; see Mark 1:7)

Chapter 10: Starting a New Movement 149
 “The one . . . who ranks ahead of me because he was before me”
(John 1:30)
 The one on whom he saw the spirit come down and remain
(John 1:33; see Mark 1:10 || Matthew 3:16 || Luke 3:22)
Even Q and the special Lukan material weigh in on this issue (Q
7:28; 16:16; you can find the special Lukan material in Luke 1:11–17,
41–45, 76–79). These explanations are most likely later additions to
the awkward historical fact that all four gospels report: that Jesus
got his start with John the Baptist’s baptism.
Did John the Baptist use a cave?
In August 2004, British archaeologist Shimon Gibson announced that he had exca-
vated a cave (with the help of American archaeologist James Tabor) 21⁄2 miles south
of Jerusalem, where he claimed that John the Baptist had immersed or anointed
his disciples. The cave had been carved some 500–800 years before Jesus’s time
and had long been used as a purification site by local Jews, as the 250,000 shards
from small pots (which may have been used to hold oil or water) and the foot-shaped
niche attest. The following are a couple of reasons that Gibson thought John must
have baptized here:
 The cave is near Ein Kerem, a village traditionally associated with John the Baptist.
 Several carvings were found inside the cave, including one of a man with unruly
hair and a spotted tunic (a convention for depicting animal hide, such as camel’s
skin). The camel’s skin clothes match the gospel description of the Baptist (Mark
1:6). The unruly hair only fits him if you imagine that John not only didn’t drink alco-
hol (Luke 1:15) but, like a full-fledged Nazirite, avoided both alcohol and cutting his
hair (see Numbers 6:1–21 for a description of the Nazirites and their special vows).
 A carving of a head was found near the cave entrance. This carving could pos-
sibly be a depiction of John’s head, which was severed by Herod Antipas and
served on a platter (Mark 6:27–28).
The evidence seems a bit sketchy, so experts believe that it isn’t very likely that the
cave was actually used by John. Besides, all of our sources, including those from
the Jewish historian Josephus, suggest that John was baptizing whole bodies (not
just feet) out in the open and drawing large crowds. Our sources also note that John
was arrested by Herod Antipas, who ruled in the Galilee and in Perea, north of
Jerusalem and east of the Jordan River. But Ein Kerem is actually in Jerusalem.
And, finally, the carvings date from the Byzantine period some 300–400 years after
John’s time.

Acting as the messenger
of the messiah
The gospel authors do a kind of “extreme makeover” of the historical
John. They rewrite his probable role as a popular Baptist and pos-
sible mentor of Jesus, making him instead the herald for Jesus — a
kind of second fiddle who came first. For the gospel authors, John
ushers in the messianic age — and the messiah is Jesus. The gospel
authors use earlier Jewish scripture to make clear just who John is
(while maintaining that Jesus is greater). For instance, consider
these references:
 The Jewish prophet Isaiah had said centuries before, “A voice
cries out: ‘In the desert, prepare the way of the Lord; Make
straight in the wilderness a highway for our God’” (Isaiah
40:3). All the gospel authors believe that John is this voice,
and so they cite that passage of Isaiah to make it clear.
 The gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke also cite the prophet
Malachi: “Look, I send my messenger to prepare the way
before me” (Malachi 3:1). Refer to Mark 1:2, Matthew 11:10,
and Luke 1:76; 7:27 to see these references.
Some Jews in Jesus’s day thought that messenger would be
Elijah, the great miracle-working prophet of Israel’s past who
had been whisked off to heaven when the sweet chariot had
swung low (2 Kings 2:1–18). Malachi himself says, “See, I will
send to you Elijah the prophet, before the day of the Lord
comes” (Malachi 4:5, which is 3:23–24 in the Hebrew text). The
gospel authors, on the other hand, turn John into the
returned Elijah; John even wears clothes of camel’s hair and
leather like Elijah (2 Kings 1:8).
How exactly did John usher in the day of Jesus? In the following
sections, you find out that John preached, started a movement
that survived him, and met his end much like Jesus did later.
Paving the way for Jesus’s final act
John paves the way for Jesus through his preaching. He warns
everyone to “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens is near”
(Matthew 3:2). Mark, Matthew, and Luke agree that John urged reli-
gious conversion with a sense of urgency that’s typical of end-times
preaching. They also agree with the Jewish historian Josephus that
John drew tremendous crowds — apparently in greater numbers
than Jesus later would. After all, Herod Antipas killed John because
he was worried about these crowds, but he didn’t kill Jesus (see the
later sidebar, “Josephus’s account of John the Baptist”).
Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
150

Chapter 10: Starting a New Movement 151
Mark and Matthew say that Jesus’s first public words were just like
John’s (Mark 1:15; Matthew 4:17). And, as awkward as it was to
admit, all four gospels note that Jesus inaugurates his ministry
from some sort of starting point under John. One gospel author
even says that Jesus practiced John’s water baptism for a time
(John 3:22, 26; 4:1). However, he then corrects himself to say that
Jesus wasn’t baptizing — only his disciples were (John 4:2).
Enduring arrest and execution
John is Jesus’s forerunner in another more unfortunate way. Like
Jesus, John is arrested by the ruler and executed. The gospels offer
one reason for the arrest: John accused the Jewish ruler Herod
Antipas of adultery for marrying his brother Philip’s wife Herodias.
The gospels actually got this all wrong. Herodias’s first husband
wasn’t Philip, but rather another brother, Herod Boethus, and her
daughter’s name was Salome (Mark mistakenly calls the daughter
Herodias in 6:22). Check out Figure 10-1 for a family tree and
Chapters 7 and 8 for more on the Herods.
Figure 10-1: A partial family tree of Herod the Great.
According to the gospels of Mark and Matthew, Herod Antipas
beheaded John because Herodias’s daughter seduced him into it
(Mark 6:17–29; Matthew 14:3–12). The Jewish historian Josephus,
on the other hand, offers a different reason for the execution — and
it’s probably more accurate (see the nearby sidebar, “Josephus’s
account of John the Baptist,” for details).

Sharing converts
Like Jesus, John had a lot of followers. They helped him baptize and
they listened to his teachings, and some may have joined the Jesus
movement (John 1:35–42). You hear about John’s disciples later in
the gospel because John sends them to find out whether Jesus really
is the promised one — apparently, John isn’t so sure! (Matthew 11:2–6
and Luke 7:18–23). These disciples bury John’s remains when Herod
Antipas beheads him (Mark 6:29; Matthew 14:12).
John’s disciples traveled around the Mediterranean after his death to
share water baptism with others. In contrast, the followers of Jesus
were practicing both John’s baptism by water and Jesus’s baptism by
the Holy Spirit (Mark 1:8; Matthew 3:11; Luke 3:16; John 1:26–27, 33).
From the early Christian vantage point, John’s baptism alone didn’t
cut it. So Jesus’s followers nudged John’s followers to take the final
plunge and accept Jesus’s baptism as well (Acts 18:24–26; 19:1–7).
And they’re still trying to do this in the gospels by presenting John as
the runner-up to Jesus.
Battling the Devil in the Desert
Immediately after being baptized, the spirit of God drives Jesus
into the wilderness where he’s tempted by Satan. Mark reports that
he was in the wilderness for 40 days and that angels ministered to
him — which may mean that they fed him (Mark 1:12–13). Matthew

Josephus’s account of John the Baptist
The Jewish historian Josephus wrote two important books: an account of the First
Jewish Revolt in 66–74 CE (which is aptly named, The Jewish War, or War for short)
and a later account of the long and venerable history of the Jews (which is called
Jewish Antiquities, or Antiquities for short, c. 93 CE). In Jewish Antiquities, Josephus
covers everything from the creation of the world down to his own time. He includes
a story about Herod Antipas’s defeat by the Nabatean King Aretas IV, the father of
Antipas’s first wife whom Antipas had jilted when he married Herodias. Within this
story, Josephus recounts how some of the Jews believed that Antipas’s defeat was
divine vengeance for his murder of John the Baptist.
Like the gospels, Josephus says John was a good man who urged justice and bap-
tized those who were committed to its practice. Unlike the gospels, however,
Josephus says that Antipas killed John because John was a powerful speaker, and
he feared that John might turn his sizeable following against Antipas in a revolt
(Jewish Antiquities, 18.5.2). Even though Josephus mentions that Herodias switched
husbands, he never says that John preached about it, and he doesn’t mention Jesus
here at all.

and Luke, on the other hand, alter the story by saying that Jesus
fasted for the whole 40 days (talk about being hungry!). They also
add sayings material from Q detailing the three temptations that
Jesus endured (Q 4:1–13). For more details on Q, flip to Chapter 5.
The gospel authors craft the temptation scenes to demonstrate
Jesus’s status as the son of God capable of defeating not just
human needs like hunger, but the power of Satan as well. They
depict Jesus deflecting each temptation with God’s own words (see
Table 10-1).

(Matthew 4:8–10; Luke 4:5–8)
(Deuteronomy 6:13).
The gospel of John doesn’t include Jesus’s scene with Satan at all.
It saves Jesus’s decisive defeat of “the ruler of this world” for the
end of the story, when Jesus defeats death (John 12:31–32).
You have two independent sources — Mark and Q — that tell the
story of Satan and Jesus. However, the heavy references to scripture
and the fact that these sources differ and there were no eyewitnesses
suggest that the early Christians were once again trying to present
something more than history, something deeper than details.
Gathering Companions
After the encounter with the Baptist movement and after Mark,
Matthew, and Luke’s desert battle with the devil, the first public
task Jesus performs in practically all four gospels is calling people
to follow him (Luke delays this a little bit). The gospels report that
Jesus had a large group of disciples, which is a term that applies to
anyone who followed him. Out of that large group, 12 men are sin-
gled out by name. Also mentioned are several women who accom-
pany Jesus from his first days in the Galilee.
Chapter 10: Starting a New Movement 153

Naming the Twelve
It seems likely that Jesus picked 12 followers during his lifetime.
The gospels don’t explain why Jesus picked these particular guys,
and they don’t agree about how early in the movement’s history
they became the core group. But nevertheless, the gospels of Mark
and John, which are independent witnesses to the historical Jesus,
refer frequently to “the Twelve” (Mark 9:35; 10:32; 11:11; John
6:67–71; 20:24). The author of Luke’s gospel usually relies on Mark
for his information, but one of Luke’s names in his list of the
Twelve is different, which may mean that the author had a different
and independent list. Paul mentions the Twelve (1 Corinthians 15:5),
and there’s also a Q saying about them (see Chapter 5 for more about
Q). So, we have five independent sources for these men.
Here’s a list of the disciples who are usually considered “the
Twelve,” listed in order of the earliest list in the gospel of Mark:
 Peter: He was a fisherman from Capernaum (John says
Bethsaida). He’s also often called Simon, Simon Peter, or
Cephas. (Cephas comes from the Aramaic for “rock,” and
Peter comes from the Greek equivalent for the same.)
 Andrew: He was Peter’s brother and fishing partner; John’s
gospel says that Andrew was first a disciple of John the Baptist.
 James: He was son of Zebedee and a fisherman from
Capernaum. He’s called “James the Great” in later tradition.
 John: He was James’s brother and partner in the family fish-
ing business. And maybe because they’re so brazen, in Mark,
Jesus gives the two brothers the name Boanerges, which is a
Greek form of the Aramaic “sons of thunder” (Mark 10:35–45).
 Philip: He was from Bethsaida, another town on the coast of
the Sea of Galilee.
 Bartholomew: This member of the Twelve doesn’t get a lot of
press. There simply aren’t any stories about him apart from the
list of the Twelve. Since the ninth century CE, some people
have wondered if he’s the Nathanael mentioned in John 1:45–51
and 21:2. Why? Because Nathanael is a normal first name and
Bartholomew was more likely a surname (the Greek is based on
the Aramaic Bar-Talmai, which means “son of Talmai”).
 Matthew: He’s called a toll collector in Matthew’s gospel. This
reference solves the problem in Mark that the toll collector Levi
is called (Mark 2:13–17) but never listed among the Twelve
(Mark 3:13–19).
 Thomas: Thomas, or “twin” in Aramaic, is called “doubting
Thomas” because he doubted Jesus’s resurrection until he
could touch Jesus’s wounds himself (John 20:24–29). He’s also
Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
154

called Didymus Thomas (which is like saying “twin” twice in
both Greek and Aramaic).
 James: This man, who was the son of Alphaeus, was called in
later tradition “James the Less” — not to be confused with
James the Great or James brother of Jesus (James was obvi-
ously a popular name at the time!).
 Simon: He was called “the Cananean” (which means “zealous”
or “jealous” in Aramaic) in Matthew and Mark and “the
Zealot” (the Greek equivalent of the same) in Luke.
 Thaddeus: There’s a bit of controversy when it comes to this
11th disciple. In Mark and Matthew, he’s called Thaddeus.
Luke, on the other hand, calls this man Jude, son of James.
 Judas Iscariot: He’s the one who betrayed Jesus to the
authorities (so he’s always put last on lists of the Twelve!).
The differences in the various lists suggest that, by the time the
gospels were written, the importance of the Twelve had begun to
wane. After all, if they or the communities they founded were still
potent, their names would be firmly entrenched and well-known to
the gospel authors.
The Twelve disciples’ importance may have been dwindling
because of their deaths, because of changing leadership patterns
in the church, or simply because traditions about the lesser-known
ones had been lost. Another reason the Twelve as a group may not
have loomed so large at the end of the first century CE has to do
with their role. The gospels report that their job was to preach to
Israel (Matthew 10:5–6) and to judge the 12 tribes of Israel at the
end of time (Q 22:30). But by the late first century, when the
gospels are composed, the message is no longer being preached
just to Israel, and the end of time seems indefinitely delayed.
Admitting the female companions
Several women accompanied Jesus from the beginning of his
public ministry in the Galilee. The gospel authors seem a little
reluctant to report this fact, however, and so they don’t provide
very many details. Their embarrassment makes it likely that these
women were in fact there. In the following sections, I explain how
different gospels cover the presence of women and describe their
role, and I look at a particularly special woman: Mary Magdalene.
Mark, Matthew, and John: Saving the best for last
Mark’s gospel is the first, and he doesn’t mention that women fol-
lowed Jesus until the end of the story, when Jesus has just died. At
this point, Mark says:
Chapter 10: Starting a New Movement 155

And there were women watching from a distance, among them
Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and
Joses, and Salome, who followed him when he was in Galilee
and ministered to him, and many other [women] who had come
up together with him to Jerusalem.
—Mark 15:40–41
Now that Jesus is dead and gone, we’re suddenly introduced to
women who have been with Jesus throughout the previous 15
chapters of the gospel! Matthew also saves any reference to the
women until Jesus has breathed his last breath (Matthew 27:55–56).
Neither Mark nor Matthew calls any of the women a mathetria (“dis-
ciple”), but both do say that they “followed” and “served” Jesus,
typical actions of disciples.
John’s gospel is like these two. He doesn’t mention Mary Magdalene
until Jesus’s death, and in any case Jesus’s mother and his “beloved
disciple” are the most important figures there (John 19:25–27). Jesus
does have a long encounter with a Samaritan woman earlier in John’s
gospel, but she doesn’t follow Jesus on the road (John 4:4–42; the
story of the adulterous woman in John 7:53–8:11 isn’t in the earliest
manuscripts of the gospels). The same is true for the sibling trio of
Mary, Martha, and Lazarus — they seem to be groupies of the “stay-
at-home” type (John 11:1–44; 12:1–7; Luke also gives that impression
in Luke 10:38–42, although he doesn’t mention Lazarus).
Luke: Putting the women in their place — early on
The author of Luke, who generally tries to improve on prior gospels
by writing “a more orderly” account (Luke 1:3), puts Jesus’s female
followers in the correct place — earlier in the gospel while Jesus is
still in the Galilee. Remember, Mark and Matthew admit that the
women were there then, but never mention them at that point in the
story. The author of Luke straightens that out by mentioning them at
the right moment. Soon after Luke introduces his list of the Twelve
male disciples (Luke 6:12–16), he says:
And soon afterwards he went on through the cities and villages
preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God,
and the Twelve were with him, and some women who had been
cured of evil spirits and illnesses, Mary called Magdalene from
whom seven demons had gone out, and Joanna wife of Chuza,
Herod’s steward, and Susanna and many others, who provided
for them out of their resources.
—Luke 8:1–3
What’s Luke up to here? Some think he’s sensitive about women hit-
ting the road with Jesus (much like Mark was). After all, women
didn’t usually travel and eat with unrelated men. No doubt some
Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
156

conservative folks wondered what exactly those women were doing
in the group. So to make sure people didn’t get the wrong idea, Luke
made the women grateful, wealthy, well-heeled, and thus above
reproach. After all, this is the only place where any gospel says that
Mary Magdalene was possessed — of seven demons, no less 
Chapter 10: Starting a New Movement 157
Mary Magdalene: How she became 
history’s holy harlot
Christian tradition and art depict Mary Magdalene as a prostitute who repented of
her evil ways and followed Jesus. That’s why Christian outreach services for unwed
mothers and prostitutes are often named after her. But this tradition has no basis in
the canonical gospels. These works tell us almost nothing about Mary, except that
she isn’t affiliated with any man (the name “Magdalene” isn’t a family name; it was
given to her because of the town from which she hails).
So why was she transformed into a prostitute? There could be several reasons,
including these:
 Luke introduces her immediately after the story of the sinful woman who anoints
Jesus’s feet (Luke 7:36–8:2), and because so few women are mentioned in the
gospels people assumed that it was the same woman.
 In John’s gospel, a woman named Mary anoints Jesus’s feet just before his
arrest; she isn’t a sinner, and she isn’t Mary Magdalene, but people tend to con-
fuse the few women named Mary, especially because they all seem to anoint
Jesus’s feet (John 12:1–8). Even more confusing is the fact that Mary Magdalene
is the one who goes to anoint Jesus’s body after his death — you can see why
people may have become confused (Mark 16:1–8).
 The gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke report the apparently common slur
that Jesus hung out with “tax collectors and sinners,” and “sinners” could
include prostitutes and adulterers. Add to that the story of Jesus’s encounter
with the adulteress that was later tacked on to John’s gospel (John 7:53–8:11),
and you can see why any woman who hung out with Jesus might be lumped
into the “loose women” category.
 Mary Magdalene was a prominent figure in the early Gnostic Christian commu-
nities (see Chapter 5 for more on the Gnostics). In their Gospel of Philip and Gospel
of Mary Magdalene she’s portrayed as the disciple Jesus loved most, the one he
privileged with special revelation (the metaphor of a divine and definitely asexual
kiss is used for that special knowledge). The Gnostics were targeted as heretics
by other Christian communities starting in the second century CE. These “main-
stream” Christians may have turned Mary into a sinful, sexualized woman in order
to strip the heretical Gnostic heroine of her power in people’s eyes.
 A few centuries after Jesus, virginity had become so celebrated that stories of
penitent sinners were all the rage — and Mary Magdalene became one.

(Mark 16:9 is a late addition to that gospel and is probably based on
Luke 8:2). That would make her pretty darn grateful to Jesus, dedi-
cated to him not because she’s a loose woman but because she’s
happy to be whole again. It’s ironic that later tradition would make
Mary Magdalene a prostitute, given how intent the gospels are to
avoid that impression (see the nearby sidebar, “Mary Magdalene:
How she became history’s holy harlot,” for more information).
Witnessing the death, burial, and resurrection
The primary role of the female disciples in the story of Jesus is to
testify to those events that were the crux of the gospel message —
the death of Jesus on the cross, his burial in a tomb, and his resur-
rection two days later. The fact that the female disciples rather than
the men performed this role isn’t unusual. The men had all scat-
tered in fear for their lives. Female followers, on the other hand,
wouldn’t have been so conspicuous to the wary Romans. And on
top of that, women in first-century Jewish culture were often the
ones who lamented the dead and prepared bodies for burial.
All four gospels mention women at the cross and tomb (see Table
10-2), and while Mary Magdalene is on every list, the other names
differ. That makes it very difficult to reconstruct exactly who was
there, apart from Mary Magdalene.

Looking at the special case of Mary Magdalene
Of all the female followers, Mary Magdalene is mentioned most reg-
ularly across the gospels, and she’s almost always at the head of
the list. This is most likely due to her prominence among the
women during Jesus’s life and to the fact that she was the first wit-
ness to his resurrection. Despite the rumors, however, it most
likely isn’t because she and Jesus were married (see the nearby
sidebar “Was Mary Magdalene Mrs. Jesus?”).
Hanging Out with 
the Wrong Crowd
Like John the Baptist, Jesus inaugurated his public ministry by
preaching repentance (Mark 1:3–4; 15; Matthew 3:2; 4:17). But it
quickly became clear that Jesus’s brand of repentance wasn’t only
the fire and brimstone, “ax to the root of the tree” tirade that John
was famous for. Instead, Jesus preached repentance by meeting
sinners on their own turf, eating and drinking with them (the con-
trast between John and Jesus is made as early as Q 7:33–35). As
Mark’s Jesus puts it, “Those who are strong don’t need a doctor,
but those who are sick; I have come not to call the righteous, but
the sinners” (Mark 2:17). And more often than not, they give him a
better reception than the righteous folks do anyway (Mark 2:13–17;
Matthew 22:1–14; Luke 7:36–50; 15:1–32).
In the gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, Jesus is frequently criti-
cized for hanging out with the wrong kinds of people, namely toll
collectors and sinners (Mark 2:13–17; Matthew 9:9–13; Luke
5:27–32; Luke 15; Mark 7:1–13). Jesus’s practice of eating and drink-
ing with sinners was a problem with some conservative folks who
had a different idea of how a “religious guy” should behave. In fact,
it presented quite the contrast to his mentor, John the Baptist, who
barely ate at all — just those tasty, honey-glazed locusts! (Mark
Chapter 10: Starting a New Movement 159

1:6). In Luke’s gospel, you find out that John will be a teetotaler
(someone who doesn’t drink alcohol) before he’s even born (Luke
1:15). The sayings source Q confirms the adult Baptist’s teetotalism,
saying that he neither ate food nor drank wine (Q 7:31–35). Jesus,
by contrast, “came eating and drinking,” and people called him “a
glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.”
John’s disciples fasted, while Jesus’s didn’t (Mark 2:18–22). John
abstained while Jesus partied. In Jesus’s practice and preaching, a
different age had dawned.
Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
160
Was Mary Magdalene Mrs. Jesus?
Given the intimate relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene at the moment
of the resurrection, particularly in John’s gospel (John 20:1–18), many people have
wondered if there was more to the pairing than the gospels let on. The idea that Jesus
and Mary were married has been especially popular in literature and in the enter-
tainment industry with books and films such as Nikos Kazantzakis’s novel The Last
Temptation of Christ (1955), Dan Brown’s novel The Da Vinci Code (2003), and the TV
documentary The Lost Tomb of Jesus (2007). Using the following historical ground
rules from Chapter 3, you can evaluate how likely the Mrs. Jesus scenario is:
 Eyewitness testimony must be in multiple, early sources: No early sources say
Jesus and Mary were married, and one even suggests that Jesus promoted
celibacy (Matthew 19:10–12). Paul seems to know that Jesus wasn’t married,
though, because when he argues that he could travel with a wife like “the other
apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas [Peter],” Jesus is conspicu-
ously missing from the list of husbands (1 Corinthians 9:5; though admittedly, this
is an argument from silence). And even though the later Gnostic gospels say that
Jesus and Mary kissed, they never say that it’s a sexual kiss or that Jesus and
Mary were married. These later gospels I refer to include the Gospel of Mary
Magdalene and the Gospel of Philip (see Chapter 5 for more about these sources).
 Embarrassing things are more likely to be true: Jesus traveled with women and
it made the gospel authors a little nervous, but they explain it for the reader
(even if they delay mentioning it). If Jesus and Mary had been married, the fact
that she traveled with him wouldn’t have been unusual at all, and it wouldn’t
have required all those textual acrobatics. It may have been a little strange for
a Jewish man not to marry, but we know of Jewish groups that practiced
celibacy during Jesus’s time (like the Essenes; see Chapter 7). Unusual and awk-
ward things that get reported anyway make traditions more credible, not less.
In the end, the canonical gospels respect Mary Magdalene for her witness to the
Christian faith. The modern novels and films can only imagine her to be significant
if she’s married and has children, as if her sexual relationship with Jesus rather than
her testimony were her chief claim to fame.

Chapter 11
Teaching Wisdom
and Telling Tales
In This Chapter
 Understanding Jesus’s teaching techniques
 Proclaiming the true kingdom of God
 Seeing how Jesus wanted to be remembered
 Discovering what Jesus left out
A
mong Christians and non-Christians alike, Jesus is widely
regarded as one of the great teachers of all time. His simple
and challenging sayings, his love for the poor and outcast, and his
willingness to die for his beliefs have long caught people’s atten-
tion and drawn them to follow him. In fact, teaching is so central to
his life that the earliest strand of the gospel tradition, the sayings
source Q (see Chapters 3 and 5), likens Jesus to divine Wisdom
itself.
In this chapter, you discover Jesus’s teaching techniques, you
delve into his central message about the kingdom of God, you find
out how he wanted to be remembered, and you read about some
hot topics today that Jesus probably never spoke about at all. As
for whether the historical Jesus taught about the need for and sig-
nificance of his own death, you find that in Chapter 14.
Teaching Wisdom with 
Jewish Techniques
Long before Jesus was born, the Jewish people had created a
wisdom tradition that everyone — from educated teachers to poor
parents — passed on. Throughout the years they passed on simple
proverbs about how to live a happy life (see the book of Proverbs)
and sophisticated stories that explored mysteries such as human
suffering (see the book of Job). For the Jews, God was the ultimate

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
162
source of wisdom, so the Torah (the first five books of the Old
Testament), which they believed God revealed to Moses, was
woven into the wisdom tradition as well (Proverbs 8:1–9:18).
In this tradition, Wisdom is personified as that part of God that
communicates with people, guiding them on the right paths.
Hebrew words can be masculine or feminine, and “wisdom” hap-
pens to be a feminine noun (hochma in Hebrew or sophia in Greek),
so Wisdom is imagined to be a feminine attribute of God.
In Jesus’s time, the Torah was the preeminent source of wisdom,
but children would also learn from their parents at home, students
would learn from their teachers, and those who attended the syna-
gogue and Temple would learn there as well (see Luke 2:46, which
mentions a youthful Jesus in the Temple with teachers). Given the
fact that most people in Palestine around the time of Jesus were
subsistence farmers, not many of these folks had time for educa-
tion outside the home and synagogue. Those who did find the
extra time would attach themselves to a particular teacher and
form a circle or school.
You can trace the teachings of several different circles in the books
that survive from the time of Jesus. Most of the evidence of these
teachings comes from elite circles that had scribes, but other more
popular movements simply relied on oral teaching, such as the
Pharisees (see Chapter 7 for more about them) and Jesus’s group.
Jesus gathered followers and taught them by using techniques typ-
ical of the Jewish wisdom teachers in his day, which I discuss in
the following sections. There’s no evidence that Jesus or his disci-
ples wrote anything down, although Jesus himself was likely liter-
ate enough to read from the Hebrew scriptures (Luke 4:16–22) or at
the very least to speak authoritatively about what was in them. All
the early written materials that survive “translate” Jesus’s teaching
out of his native Aramaic into Greek and were compiled a couple of
generations after his death. But even in Greek, it’s clear that Jesus
used teaching techniques popular among Jewish teachers.
Posing parables
In Jesus’s time, one of the most common ways to teach wisdom
was through parables. A parable is a short story that puts students
in a fictional setting so that they can learn a lesson that bears on
their lives. The technique was and is still popular for a lot of rea-
sons. Sometimes it’s because the teacher has taken something
commonplace and made it a really clever metaphor for something
else. Sometimes the student or hearer is sort of tricked into getting
a lesson they’re having trouble seeing. And sometimes the parable
presents such a riddle that the student doesn’t really know what

Chapter 11: Teaching Wisdom and Telling Tales 163
it’s about, so he or she can’t stop thinking about it and wondering
how to apply it to life.
The parable of the Good Samaritan
The parable of the Good Samaritan appears in Luke 10:25–37. In
this story, a lawyer asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal
life, and Jesus asks him what the law says. (In Deuteronomy 6:5,
the law says “Love God with your whole heart, soul, and strength,”
and in Leviticus 19:18 it says “Love your neighbor as yourself.”)
Embarrassed and seeking to save face, the lawyer asks, “And who
is my neighbor?” And Jesus responds with a parable about a man,
like the lawyer, who’s walking to Jericho. He gets beaten up by rob-
bers and left for dead. Two Jewish leaders pass him by, but a
Samaritan stops and lavishly tends to his wounds.
Jesus concludes the lesson with a question for the overconfident
lawyer: “Which of these three seems to you to be neighbor to the
man who fell among robbers?” The lawyer can’t bear to say
“Samaritan” (see Chapter 7 for background on the Samaritans’ bad
blood with the Jews). But he has to admit, “The one who showed
him mercy.” Jesus tells him to “Go and do likewise,” to go and act
not like a self-righteous, self-proclaimed legal expert but as a mer-
ciful man who truly represents the heart of the Jewish law. With
parables, there’s always either a sting in the punch line or a riddle
that leaves you scratching your head. Here, the lawyer got tricked
into learning the lesson about the Torah that he didn’t want to
know.
The parable of the prodigal son
The parable of the prodigal son appears in Luke 15:1–2, 11–32. In
this parable, the Pharisees and scribes were upset that Jesus was
drawing crowds of toll collectors and sinners. Jesus tells them the
story of a father who has two sons. The younger one wants to take
off and have fun, so he collects his inheritance and belongings,
ventures to another country, and blows his money partying. Soon
he’s feeding pigs as some guy’s slave, when he realizes that if he
were one of his dad’s servants he’d at least get fed. So, he decides
to return home and beg forgiveness. But he never gets the chance
to deliver his mea culpa. Instead, his father is standing at the road
on the lookout for him. Seeing his lost son, the father runs down
the road, throws his arms around him and takes him back in as his
son, not his slave. He pulls out all the stops and throws a party 
for him.
You can probably imagine how the older brother felt. He’s ticked
and boycotts the party, so his dad tries to coax him in, and the
parable ends before you find out what he did. In the same way, the
parable is coaxing the Pharisees and scribes to join the party that
Jesus is throwing, as he extends God’s prodigal mercy to the lost.

Condensing wisdom into sayings
Another teaching technique that Jesus used was catchy or pithy
sayings. These short, memorable sayings were intended to catch a
person’s attention and capture the core idea so that it stuck in his
or her mind (much like bumper stickers on cars and good sound
bytes on the news). Here are a few examples from the gospels:
 “Who are my mother and brothers? . . . Here are my mother
and my brothers. Whoever does the will of God, this one is my
brother and sister and mother” (Mark 3:33–35).
 “When someone wants to drag you to court to take your shirt,
give him your cloak, too” (Matthew 5:40).
 “Do you think that I’ve come to give peace in the earth? No, I
tell you, but rather division . . .” (Luke 12:51; Matthew 10:34).
 “And just as you wish that men would do to you, do so to
them” (Luke 6:31; Matthew 7:12).
These sayings of Jesus were likely written down soon after his life.
After all, as his followers hit the road to spread Jesus’s message,
they needed some kind of cheat sheet of his sayings. There’s evi-
dence of such lists in the sayings source Q and the Gospel of
Thomas (flip to Chapter 5 for more on Q and Thomas).
Catchy sayings are great, but without a story around them it can
be unclear how to read them. For instance, does “give him your
cloak, too” mean that you have to cave to every bully’s demands?
Because Jesus’s sayings need some context for clarity, they have
come down to us embedded in gospels rather than lists. Set in
short stories or grouped in longer discourses, the sayings make
more sense.
Rhyming to remember
The gospels don’t preserve Jesus’s teachings in his native Aramaic
language. But scholars think that, if they did, some of Jesus’s say-
ings would be in rhythmic or rhyming patterns that would have
made these oral traditions easier to remember. Table 11-1 offers an
example of what the Lord’s Prayer may have sounded like with
these patterns (Luke 11:2–4; Matthew 6:9–13). In addition to the
rhymes (which are underlined), there are some rhythmic patterns,
like using the same number of syllables in two linked lines (in
Aramaic, “hallowed be your name” has five syllables, and the
second line “your kingdom come” does too).

Using familiar images
Jesus used common images in his teaching: seeds growing, weeds
choking the plants off, birds nesting in shrubs, a woman sweeping
her house, a servant doing his master’s bidding, a farmer building
barns for his grain. These images are usually metaphors for other
things, such as the reign of God or human vanity.
These images get their most extended treatment in parables (such
as the parable of the sower casting seed that falls on four different
types of ground, which is an image of how Jesus’s message of the
kingdom is received; Mark 4:1–20). But these metaphors could also
occur in the short sayings, such as when Jesus compares the “men
of this generation” to children sitting in a marketplace and com-
plaining (Q 7:31–32). Like any good teacher, Jesus invited people to
consider deeper truths by using accessible images.
Teaching by example
The most effective way that Jesus taught was by example — he
knew the saying that actions speak louder than words. That princi-
ple certainly wasn’t unique to the Jewish wisdom tradition, but it’s
firmly planted there in the understanding that ethical actions
demonstrate the presence of wisdom. Like other teachers, the
gospels show him doing to others what he taught others to do.
For example, he preached that God accepted repentant sinners,
and he himself met and ate with those who repented (Jesus’s shar-
ing a meal with these folks symbolized their repentance and return
to the community of God, much like John’s baptisms). He preached
Chapter 11: Teaching Wisdom and Telling Tales 165

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
166
that people should give up their possessions to follow him, and he,
too, left his home and family. He taught his followers to serve each
other by first serving them himself.
Making use of different techniques
in the gospel of John
The gospel of John does something entirely different with Jesus’s
teaching. He still teaches with sayings and by example, but instead
of offering parables and short sayings or sayings grouped into dis-
courses, John’s Jesus consistently speaks in lengthy monologues
or dialogues that can run as long as a full chapter. A dialogue may
start with a traditional saying such as “Unless someone is born
from above, he can’t see the kingdom of God” (John 3:3). But then
John develops a whole dialogue with Nicodemus going back and
forth for 18 verses about what that short saying really means.
Historical Jesus scholars consider this kind of lengthening to be
evidence of significant post-resurrection interpretation. As a result,
they don’t consider John’s portrait of Jesus to be the most reliable
historical evidence. They don’t rule out the entire gospel, however,
because isolated traditions have a good claim to authenticity.
This judgment that John’s gospel adds later interpretation to the
historical Jesus’s sayings is true of other features of John’s gospel
as well. For example, John’s gospel says that Jesus knew he was
divine, anticipated everything that was coming, and was com-
pletely in control of his own trial and crucifixion. Historical Jesus
scholars treat these features as post-resurrection insights read
back in to Jesus’s life rather than as evidence for the historical
Jesus’s self-knowledge and identity.
Jesus’s Central Theme: Introducing
the Reign of God
Jesus’s teaching takes many forms, but each shares one consistent
theme — that God’s rule is underway. The phrase “reign (or king-
dom) of God,” “kingdom of heaven,” or “kingdom of my father,”
occurs 13 times in Mark, 13 times in Q, 31 times in Matthew and
Luke, and 2 times in John.
The belief that God is in charge had long characterized the Jewish
faith, but over the centuries of foreign domination that belief had
been tested. Jesus preached that God would soon return in power,
and as you see in Chapter 12, Jesus accompanied that message with

powerful signs that lent credibility to the message in people’s eyes.
In the following sections, I explain how Jesus introduced the reign
of God by presenting it as an alternative to the Roman Empire, and I
discuss a few details and rules of this divine kingdom.
Proclaiming the kingdom of God as
an alternative to Roman rule
Jesus’s assertion that God’s rule or kingdom was at hand was a
not-so-veiled challenge to the current rulers (see Chapters 6 and 8
for more about Rome). His assertion implied that their rule was
defective and that God’s vision for the world was different.
At times, Jesus’s teachings seemed to parody the propaganda of the
Roman Empire. Jesus challenged the Empire by doing the following:
 Calling God abba, which means “father” or “dad” in
Aramaic: Referring to God like this was seen as disrespectful
to the Roman Emperor because he considered himself the
father and king. Emperor Augustus (see Chapter 6 for details
about him) had taken the formal title pater patriae (meaning
“father of the fatherland”) in 2 BCE. The practice of referring
to an emperor as father and king, especially in the Near East,
contributed to the religious cult of the emperor, who was
likened to the ruler of the gods (Zeus/Jupiter). Jesus, however,
prayed to a different father king and God.
 Blessing the poor, the mourners, and the hungry: Augustan
buildings, statuary, and coins depicted the imperial family as
a source of prosperity and peace, and dedicatory inscriptions
to them and their affiliates in the provinces lavished praise on
those who bestowed material benefits. Jesus instead taught
that the source of prosperity is God, not the emperor or the
wealthy. He imagined a kingdom where the oppressed would
be blessed (see the next section for more about these
oppressed folks).
 Healing and feeding people: A ruler’s chief responsibility was
to “save” people by providing conditions for them to thrive.
For that reason, the emperors often took the title s_t_r (or
“savior”). They justified their absolute power by claiming to
have their subjects’ best interests at heart. The fact that there
were plenty of people that Jesus needed to heal and feed points
to the failure of human rule and to the advent of true salvation.
 Creating a community of the Twelve: Against the expanding
Roman Empire, Jesus envisioned a kingdom that harked back
to Israel’s earliest constitution of 12 tribes. So, he created a
Chapter 11: Teaching Wisdom and Telling Tales 167

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
168
community of 12 disciples (which was called the Twelve) and
sent them out to expand God’s “empire” (see Chapter 10 for
more about the Twelve).
The previous are just the examples that have a historical basis.
The gospel authors paint God’s reign as an alternative to Rome and
its client kingdoms in many other ways as well. For example:
 When they speak of Jesus’s return in glory (with the term “the
[second] coming”), they’re using the very word that was
coined for the emperor’s visits to the provinces.
 When they refer to Jesus’s message as the “good news” or
“gospel,” they’re redefining the very term that the emperor
used to announce his own success.
 Even terms such as faith (or loyalty), justice, and peace were
prominent in Roman propaganda, and so they carried political
freight when used by the gospel authors.
It isn’t clear whether the historical Jesus thought of himself as king
of God’s kingdom. For one thing, we don’t really have access to
what he thought; we have only the later reflections on his story in
the gospels. But one historical fact speaks against it: Had Jesus
preached that he was a king or the royal messiah, particularly of
the Davidic warrior stripe, the tetrarch Herod Antipas would have
hauled him into the slammer while he was still preaching in the
Galilee. After all, he beheaded John the Baptist for a lot less! (See
Chapter 10 for more on John’s beheading.) In Chapter 14 I take up
why Jesus is finally executed as King of the Jews.
Seeing who’s invited to the kingdom
Jesus may have been a wisdom teacher, but he sure didn’t attract the
most sophisticated students. Rather than wealthy or educated folks,
such as lawyers and scholars, his first followers were fishermen, a
toll collector (he might have been well-off), a zealot/rebel, and a guy
who would betray him in the end. And, of course, he takes a lot of
heat for hanging out with thieves and prostitutes (the proverbial “toll
collectors and sinners”). It’s no surprise that the citizens of the
kingdom that he teaches about look like a pretty ragtag bunch, too.
Blessing the poor, mourners, and hungry through beatitudes
One of the earliest collections of Jesus’s sayings is the beatitudes, or
blessings. Some preachers today refer to them as “be-attitudes” —
the attitudes you should cultivate if you follow Jesus. But the earli-
est and most historical of the beatitudes aren’t so much attitudes
that you would cultivate; they’re more like states that you would
rather not be in, such as poverty, mourning, and hunger.

The beatitudes are preserved in Matthew and Luke. Matthew has
nine beatitudes and Luke shares four of those. The shared beatitudes
most likely came from the common source Q (see Chapters 3 and 5
for more on Q). Table 11-2 lays out the beatitudes in these sources.
Table 11-2

. . . hated, excluded, reviled, cast

(6:22–23).
Because the last beatitude in the table is longer than the other
three, some people think that it wasn’t part of Jesus’s original
preaching even though apparently it was in Q. The oral sayings in
Q are usually shorter and pithier, and besides, expanding on the
persecutions that followers might endure is just the kind of thing
that followers who have already endured those persecutions might
amplify. So, if that last beatitude is a late addition or expansion,
that leaves the poor, the mourners, and the hungry as God’s spe-
cial guests in Jesus’s original teaching. The presumption is that the
wealthy, laughing, and well-fed won’t be on the guest list. In fact,
Luke makes this fact explicit in his subsequent “woes,” when he
presents Jesus proclaiming how miserable the rich, the full, the
happy, and the well-regarded people will soon be (Luke 6:24–26).

Inviting sinners to share a meal
In addition to the economically disadvantaged, the kingdom that
Jesus preached about included any sinner who repented of his or
her sinful ways. This practice seems to have been a continuation of
John the Baptist’s tradition (see Chapter 10). John preached repen-
tance and symbolized it through a dip in the Jordan River.
However, Jesus’s chief way of symbolizing the repentance of a
sinner was to share a meal with him. In the gospels of Mark,
Matthew, and Luke, Jesus does this right away with Levi, the toll
collector. Immediately after Jesus calls Levi to follow him, they’re
at Jesus’s house for a meal (Mark 2:14–17; Matthew 9:9–13). This
meal is held at Levi’s house in Luke’s gospel (Luke 5:29).
This practice of eating with sinners earned Jesus the reputation of
a sinner himself — and a glutton and a drunkard to boot (see
Chapter 10). But it seems to reflect his vision of God’s mercy. As in
the parable of the prodigal son, which I cover earlier in this chap-
ter, God is so overjoyed at the return of sinners that the righteous
are practically ignored. You can also compare this situation to the
one in the parable of the good shepherd, who leaves the 99 sheep
to find the one who’s strayed (Luke 15:1–7).
Rejecting the rich
One of the most awkward of Jesus’s sayings is that the rich will
have a rough time getting admitted to God’s reign. This teaching
astounded his disciples. After all, they lived in a world with virtu-
ally no government handouts, a world where you depended first on
your extended family for help and then on the mercy of the
wealthy. The wealthy were praised for donations that they would
make for the care of the sick, the widows, the orphans, the immi-
grants, and the burial of the dead. Heck, the wealthy often praised
themselves by attaching inscriptions to public buildings, such as
hospitals and synagogues, noting their benefactions. However,
Jesus came along and said:
How hard it will be for those who have possessions to enter into
the reign of God . . . Children, how hard it is to enter the reign of
God. It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for
a rich man to enter into the reign of God.
—Mark 10:23–25
This motif of favoring the poor over the rich is especially promi-
nent in Luke’s gospel. To stress his point, he adds the following:
 Mary’s song praising God for lifting the lowly and the hungry
(Luke 1:46–55)
 The image of Jesus born in a stable (Luke 2:7)

 John the Baptist’s “economic” advice to the crowds, toll col-
lectors, and soldiers (Luke 3:10–14)
 A warning against greed (Luke 12:13–15)
 The parable of the rich fool who builds bigger barns to store
his huge harvest only to die that night (Luke 12:16–21)
 A teaching about humility at banquets and about inviting to
your table those who can’t repay you (Luke 14:7–14)
 The parable of the rich man and the beggar Lazarus (Luke
16:19–31)
 The story of the toll collector Zacchaeus who gives half of his
possessions to the poor and all of his ill-gotten gains at 400
percent interest (Luke 19:1–10)
Keep in mind the rule for reconstructing history from the sources: A
tradition is on firmer historical footing if it’s reported in multiple
independent witnesses (see Chapter 3 for more details). When only
one gospel stresses a point, and does so over and over again in a
unique fashion, it starts to look like the theme is the author’s special
interest. That doesn’t mean that Jesus didn’t share the sentiment. It
just means that the specific teachings one finds only in Luke more
likely trace to the gospel author than to the historical Jesus.
Finding out the kingdom’s rules
For the most part, Jesus’s take on the rules of the kingdom of God
followed and even strengthened the commands that had been
revealed earlier in Jewish history. But he also took certain liberties
with them, and offered some new ones too.
Reinforcing the Law of Moses
The Jewish people already had a law to live by, namely the Law of
Moses, better known as the Torah. It wasn’t just laws, however;
this collection also included the stories from the first five books of
the Bible (see Chapter 7 for more on the Torah).
Here are some of the ways that Jesus practiced the Law of Moses:
 Jesus wore the kraspedon, a garment with fringes that were
designed to remind the practicing Jew of the commandments
(Numbers 15:38–39; Mark 6:56).
 Jesus kept the Sabbath, which is the day of rest that practic-
ing Jews observed from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday
(Mark 1:21–22; Exodus 20:8–11; Deuteronomy 5:12–15).
Like other Jews, it was Jesus’s custom to attend the synagogue
on the Sabbath to hear and discuss readings from the Torah
Chapter 11: Teaching Wisdom and Telling Tales 171

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
172
(Mark 1:21; 3:1–6; Luke 4:16). The gospels say that he also healed
on the Sabbath and that some people thought this violated the
principle of rest. (You can read more on that in Chapter 13.)
 Jesus participated in the pilgrimage festivals and sacrifices at
the Jerusalem Temple even though his home was a couple of
days’ journey to the north (Mark 14:1–2; Matthew 26:1–5; Luke
22:1; John 2:13; 5:1; 7; 10:22; 11:55–57).
In addition, Jesus summarized the 613 commandments of the
Torah in his teaching by quoting 2, Deuteronomy 6:4–5 and
Leviticus 19:18, as did other rabbis of the time. When one of the
scribes approached him and asked which commandment was first
or most important, Jesus replied:
The first is this: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one,
and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with
all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength”
[Deuteronomy 6:4–5]. The second is this: “You shall love your
neighbor as yourself” [Leviticus 19:18]. There is no other
commandment greater than these.
—Mark 12:29–31
The gospels present Jesus’s teaching to be radically faithful to the
Law of Moses and the prophets (for more on this dynamic duo, see
the nearby sidebar “Jesus’s ‘Bible’”). So, just like the prophets
before him, Jesus could be critical of how the Law of Moses was
practiced if he thought a deeper principle of the law was at stake.
For example, Jesus praises a scribe who gets the message that love
of God and neighbor is more important than Temple rituals, just as
the earlier Jewish prophets had said (Mark 12:32–34; see 1 Samuel
15:22; Hosea 6:6; Micah 6:6–8). Laws weren’t actually rejected, but
some did take priority. So, Matthew is probably accurate “in spirit”
when he reports Jesus’s position:
Don’t think that I’ve come to tear down the law or the prophets; I
haven’t come to tear down but to fulfill. Truly I tell you: Until
heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or serif will pass away
from the law, until all things have occurred.
—Matthew 5:17–18
The gospels probably add quite a bit to the historical record when it
comes to Jesus’s attitude toward the Law of Moses. Between the
historical Jesus and the gospels’ composition, Jesus’s followers
debated the relevance of significant parts of the Jewish law,
especially dietary laws (Galatians 2:12) and the obligation for males
to be circumcised (Galatians 5:1–12). As more and more non-Jews
entered the Christian faith, the issue only became more pointed.

These debates reshaped the memory of the historical Jesus’s views.
As a result, the gospel authors overemphasize and escalate the
debates between Jesus and the Pharisees and scribes. But if Jesus
himself had dismissed all or part of the Jewish law, there would have
been no later debate about which parts to keep and which parts to
jettison; Jesus’s teaching would’ve settled the matter.
Deepening the law of Moses
Even though Jesus’s teaching was grounded in Jewish law and
ethics, he often took the law a little further than Moses originally
did. In that respect, Jesus was more like the Pharisees than not;
they, too, were trying to extend the written Law of Moses with oral
supplements that applied the old law to new situations (see
Chapter 7 for details).
In Matthew 5:21–48, the author collects some sayings of Jesus from
Q and his own sources that require followers to “be perfect as your
heavenly Father is perfect” (Matthew 5:48). All of these take the
Law of Moses and extend it or make it tougher. Table 11-3 lays out
Jesus’s sayings against the passages from the Law of Moses so that
you can see for yourself how Jesus intensifies the laws.

Chapter 11: Teaching Wisdom and Telling Tales 173

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
174
These “new rules” set the bar pretty high for Jesus’s disciples! No
lustful looks and no anger? What fun is that? It’s a pretty impossi-
ble standard, but in a way, that’s the point: No one is really right-
eous; no one is really like God. The first step in following this law is
to realize that humans aren’t the authors of it. There’s no room for
the self-righteous here. That’s why Matthew follows this up with
advice against religious hypocrisy (Matthew 6:1–18) and the accu-
mulation of money (Matthew 6:19–25) — the hypocrites consider
themselves the ultimate judges of what God’s law is (Matthew
7:1–5; 12), while the wealthy risk thinking that they’re self-sufficient
and don’t need God at all (Matthew 6:25–34; 7:7–11).
Jesus as God’s Wisdom
When it comes to the rules of the kingdom of God, Jesus appears
to assume the authority of a legal expert. He determines how the
Torah should be read, and he feels free to define the principles
behind the Jewish law. The gospel authors, especially Matthew, set
Jesus up on par with the greatest legal expert in Jewish history:
the lawgiver himself, Moses. When Matthew presents Jesus going
up a mountain to teach followers about the Jewish law, he’s
emphasizing that Jesus is like Moses, who also went up a mountain
and proclaimed a law (Matthew 5–7). But when he presents Jesus
giving the law rather than receiving it from God (as Moses did),
he’s positioning Jesus well above Moses and in league with God.
Jesus’s “Bible”
The Torah wasn’t the only source of revealed law around the time of Jesus. The
books of the great prophets who served as royal advisers during the Israelite monar-
chy preserved oracles that challenged the king and the people to live according to
God’s law. By Jesus’s time, “the law and the prophets” was a stock phrase that
referred to the scriptures (Matthew 7:12; Luke 16:16; 24:27). Luke adds the psalms to
this list as well (Luke 24:44). During this time, people seem to have used this phrase
like we might use the term “Bible” today.
Jewish groups, including the Samaritans (see Chapter 7), agreed about the author-
ity of the Torah, although the exact contents of their Torahs differed a bit from each
other. However, among those groups that looked to additional books as scripture,
there were more significant differences over which books counted as “prophets”
and authoritative wisdom books or “writings.” Even some of the New Testament
authors mention authoritative scriptures that aren’t in the Bible today (see Jude 6
and possibly Matthew 2:23).

The earlier sayings source Q doesn’t present Jesus as Moses, but it
does tie him to divine revelation. For instance, in Q, Jesus doesn’t
only speak God’s wisdom, he actually becomes Wisdom:
The son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, “See,
a glutton and a drunk, a friend of toll collectors and sinners.” But
wisdom is justified by all her children.
—Luke 7:35; Matthew 11:19
Figuring out when the 
kingdom is coming
The historical Jesus seems to have expected that God’s reign and a
final judgment were near at hand. He received John’s baptism in
anticipation of the day of the Lord. He prepared for that day by gath-
ering 12 disciples. This action was symbolic of the restoration of the
scattered 12 tribes of Israel (for the expectation that the scattered
people would be gathered back to the land, see Isaiah 27:12–13;
43:1–8; Hosea 11:11; Baruch 4:37; 5:5–6; 2 Maccabees 1:27, 29; 2:18).
Like these earlier writers, Jesus envisioned that soon faithful Israel
and all the nations would gather together at God’s table (Isaiah
56:1–8). But there is another, darker note sounded as well, that those
in Israel who rejected this kingdom would be left in the cold:
I say to you that many from the east and west will come and
recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the
heavens, while the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the
outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and grinding
of teeth.
—Matthew 8:11–12; Luke 13:28–29
Another example showing that Jesus thought the coming of the
kingdom was close was when he told the famous parable of the
sower who scatters seed. In this parable, after the seeds are scat-
tered, the sun scorches some, birds eat a few, and weeds choke the
seedlings, but some of the seeds land in fertile soil and grow into a
rich harvest (Mark 4:1–20). The seed is the teaching Jesus “sows”
in the ears of his hearers in expectation of an approaching harvest.
Like the mustard seed of another parable, the kingdom starts small
but grows large (Mark 4:30–32). These agricultural metaphors
imply that the “harvest” or end is near.
It seems that Jesus thought some of his disciples would survive to
see the son of man return (Matthew 10:23; Mark 9:1; 13:30); Paul
thought the same thing (1 Thessalonians 4:13–18; 1 Corinthians
Chapter 11: Teaching Wisdom and Telling Tales 175

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
176
7:26, 29–31; 15:51–52; Romans 13:11–14). But Jesus also acknowl-
edged that the precise day or hour was unknown, even to him
(Mark 13:32–37; Q 7:26–36; 12:39–46; 19:11–27).
At the same time, Jesus also seems to have acted as if the reign of
God had already started. In the gospels, he claims as much on the
proof of his power over Satan (Luke 11:20; Mark 3:27). Jesus’s other
healings led people to believe that God’s power was breaking into
the world in new ways (Matthew 11:2–6; Luke 4:18–19 quoting Isaiah
61:1–2). See Chapter 12 for more on Jesus’s miracles. His practice of
eating with sinners rather than fasting also suggests that, for Jesus,
the end-time party had already begun (Mark 2:18–20).
Covering all the bases
in the Lord’s Prayer
As you might expect, Jesus prayed a lot. So, his disciples asked
him to teach them how to pray, too. The core of the prayer that
Jesus taught them, which is preserved in Q, covers all the chief
themes about the kingdom (Matthew 6:9–13 || Luke 11:2–4):
 “Father”
 “Hallowed be your name — your Kingdom come”
 “Our daily bread give us today”
 “And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors”
 “And do not lead us to the test”
The prayer focuses on God’s rule and God’s mercy. Unlike human
rulers, this Father was truly holy, fed followers, showed mercy on
debts owed him (presumably sins) and expected followers to do
likewise with all debts owed them (financial and spiritual), and
could protect followers from evil.
Advising Followers How
to Remember Him
A couple of practices that Jesus taught, particularly toward the
end of his life, had to do with his followers’ remembrance of him.
Establishing a memorial meal
At his final meal with his disciples on the eve of his arrest (see
Chapter 14), Jesus broke bread, gave thanks, and shared it with the

Twelve, calling it “my body broken for you.” At that point, he took
a cup of wine, gave thanks again, and shared it with them, calling it
“the cup of the new covenant in my blood” (1 Corinthians 11:23–26;
Mark 14:22–25; Matthew 26:26–29; Luke 22:14–20). He then asked
his disciples to remember him whenever they shared this meal.
It seems that the earliest Christians remembered this meal not
simply by sharing bread and wine or by recalling Jesus’s words.
Instead, because Jesus had made the bread and wine symbols of
the gift of his life for them, they understood that the meal was
about serving others (John 13:1–17). Remember the part of the
Lord’s Prayer that asks God to give people their “daily bread”?
According to early traditions, the first Christians made sure that
their members got their daily bread by collecting and sharing their
surplus (Acts 2:42–47; 4:32–35; 6:1).
Jesus’s final meal looks both to the past and to the future. The meal
helped Jesus look backward to his table fellowship with sinners and
forward to the messianic party God would throw at the end of time.
Exemplifying service
Jesus shares a final meal with his disciples in John’s gospel, too,
only you never hear anything about what they eat! Instead, Jesus
stood up from the table, took off his outer garment, and proceeded
to wash each disciple’s feet (John 13:1–20).
The image of Jesus washing someone’s feet is a striking one that
may be lost on you and me because most people today don’t own
slaves. In Jesus’s time they did, however, and foot washing was one
of those menial, dirty, smelly jobs you left to your servants. People
wore sandals and walked on dirt roads with animal excrement and
garbage scattered everywhere. Would you want to wash feet that
had tramped through that?
Here’s how John’s Jesus explains why he decided to take up foot
washing: If he, as their teacher, takes on the role of his students’
slave, they should do the same for others. It’s an impressive image
of humility for the community’s future leaders.
Things Jesus Didn’t Talk About
Given how much attention certain topics get today, you may be
surprised to find out that Jesus never even addressed some of
them. For example, we have no evidence that the historical Jesus
spoke about the following hot topics of today:
Chapter 11: Teaching Wisdom and Telling Tales 177

Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
178
 Abortion: The earliest reference to abortion is in the Didache
2.2, or “Teachings of the Twelve,” which is a Christian docu-
ment that circulated in the late first and early second century
CE. In this document, abortion is grouped with a teaching
against infanticide, or the killing of newborns, in a short chap-
ter on the love of neighbor.
The Epistle of Barnabas from about the same time makes the
same point, grouping the command against abortion with the
prohibition of infanticide, love of neighbor, and the encour-
agement to discipline children (Barnabas 19.5). Even though
these texts are early, there’s nothing like them in the gospels
at all when Jesus discusses love of neighbor. So, there’s no
evidence that Jesus addressed the issue.
 His own divinity: One of the cardinal principles of historical
Jesus research is that the belief in Jesus’s divinity is a post-
resurrection phenomenon. During his life, his acts of power
were understood as signs that God (or Satan) was working
through him — not that he was God.
The gospel of John presents Jesus teaching that he’s divine, but
most scholars treat this as a later interpretation rather than a
historical fact because it’s so much more highly developed here
than in the earlier gospels and gospel sources (see the section
“Making use of different techniques in the gospel of John”).
 Priesthood: Jesus called followers and selected the Twelve to
judge Israel, but he never ordained anyone or presented the
disciples’ role in terms of the Temple priesthood. There
wasn’t any need for all that future planning — because he
probably thought that the world would end soon.
 Sex: Jesus offered a brief saying or two about marriage in the
context of divorce (Matthew 5:31–32; 19:1–10; Luke 16:18;
Mark 10:11–12), and in one passage in Matthew favored
celibacy, although this doesn’t seem to go back to Jesus. Paul
says celibacy is his preference, not the Lord’s command (1
Corinthians 7:6, 25). And, despite how much people argue it
today, we don’t have any record that Jesus ever mentioned
anything about homosexuality.
 Slavery: Jesus doesn’t teach against slavery; in fact, he seems
to presume it without criticizing it in his parables (Mark
12:1–9; Matthew 22:1–14).
While the historical Jesus never spoke about these (and many
other) issues, most Christian denominations understand their tradi-
tions to be based not only on the historical Jesus’s words and deeds,
but also on developing traditions about him that are present in the
gospels and in ongoing biblical interpretation and church teaching.

Working Miracles and
Confounding Crowds
In This Chapter
 Performing miracles in Jesus’s time
 Witnessing Jesus’s acts of power
 Finding out what the miracles say about Jesus
 Looking at modern opinions of Jesus’s miracles
T
he word “miracle” comes from the Latin word miraculum,
which means “an astonishing thing.” The gospels use slightly
different words for the astonishing things that Jesus does — words
like “sign,” “act of power,” “wonder,” and “astonishing (or amazing)
deed.” Whatever word you use, there’s no question that the histori-
cal Jesus wowed the crowds by performing deeds they couldn’t
explain.
In this chapter, you explore what these miracles meant in Jesus’s
world and why some experts don’t believe that they occurred. You
also test the healing and nature miracles against the historical
rules to figure out which ones Jesus most likely performed. Finally,
you discover what these acts of power signify about Jesus in the
eyes of the gospel authors.
Working Wonders in Jesus’s Day
In Jesus’s time, most people believed that God (or the gods) inter-
vened in the world, whether on the macro level of political and
military affairs or at the micro level of bodily health. Divine inter-
ventions were studied and sought in the official temples of the
various deities around the Mediterranean.

The Epicurean philosophers of the Greco-Roman world were an
important exception. They doubted that the gods could be enticed
to do anything because one of their chief attributes was a tranquil-
ity that precluded any involvement with the day-to-day administra-
tion of this world.
Even though the Epicurean gods acted like cosmic couch potatoes,
other people’s gods were glad to get involved. For example, the
micro-managing Stoic deities could be coaxed to reveal omens of the
future through various technologies of divination on a daily basis!
(Divination is the practice of reading the future through natural
signs.)
In the following sections, I explain the similarities and differences
between medicine and magic in the time of Jesus, and I discuss the
debate on whether Jesus himself was a magician.
Practicing medicine and magic
Many people in Jesus’s day sought physical remedies from profes-
sional medical practitioners, some of whom worked at sanctuaries
dedicated to healing. But people also sought their remedies from a
host of lay technicians and folk practitioners such as Jesus. Not all
these practitioners were considered miracle workers, however.
What set a miracle apart was the wonder or awe it inspired. When
no one could explain it in terms of how things normally worked, the
cause was thought to lie in some superhuman, supernatural force.
These folk healers and miracle workers used various techniques to
achieve their goals. The evidence of these folk practices comes from
a variety of artifacts. Most significant are the so-called magical
papyri — fragments of papyrus scrolls that log various incantations,
spells, and rituals intended to produce certain effects. The papyri
we have date from the 1st century BCE to the 12th century CE. Also,
various incantation bowls (used in rituals with the incantations
pressed into the clay), inscribed amulets, and references in ancient
novels, histories, and gospels allude to attempts to ward off evil and
attract divine assistance.
The professional medical doctors trained in Greek traditions were
less likely to look to deities and demons as the immediate cause of
illness, and so incantations weren’t usually part of their repertoire.
But despite this difference, there were similarities between the
magical papyri and the medical treatises (like the Hippocratic
Corpus and the medical treatises compiled by the famous school
of medicine in Alexandria, Egypt, around 330 BCE). Both followed
certain conventions, such as
Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
180

 Recipes for foods that the patient should eat (in the medical
treatises, these recipes are based on complex models of the
body’s four humors: black bile, phlegm, yellow bile, and blood)
 Activities the patient should undertake
 Prayers and invocations to be uttered by the practitioner (in
the magical papyri, these expressions involve lists of divine
names and strings of syllables in various languages)
The purposes of the incantations in the magical papyri range all
the way from exorcism to the extermination of bedbugs. In many
ways, the miracle workers were the ancient equivalent of modern
pharmacists, except that they dispensed incantations and potions
in place of pills and injections.
Debating whether Jesus 
was a magician
It was easy to tell a professional doctor from a folk healer: The
doctor had trained in established schools, while the folk healer
had more local, popular training. It was a little tougher to tell the
difference between a magician and a miracle worker because their
techniques and results often looked the same. In fact, the differ-
ence comes down to your opinion about the work. You would use
the term “magician” when you wanted to criticize someone. It
implied that the practitioner operated on the margins of “true” reli-
gion or sought to make a buck by his own slight of hand. The term
“miracle worker,” by contrast, had a positive meaning — it implied
that the agent behind one’s work was a beneficent deity or force.
Was Jesus himself a magician or a miracle worker? The fact that
the gospels never call Jesus a magos (magician) isn’t too surprising
considering that the term was usually reserved for people you
were criticizing. But the gospel authors do report other slurs
against Jesus, including the following:
 That he’s possessed by Beelzebul (Mark 3:22; see the later
sidebar “The Lord of the flies” for more about this term)
 That he blasphemes (Mark 2:7)
 That he deceives (Matthew 27:63; John 7:12, 47)
So while the gospels don’t report that anyone explicitly called
Jesus a magician, these other slurs come awfully close, especially
the charge that Jesus was a deceiver or imposter.
Chapter 12: Working Miracles and Confounding Crowds 181

The gospels are certainly keen to give a different impression. They
never report that Jesus took money for his cures, and they never
report any special incantations during his cures. Instead, he used
simple, straightforward commands, whose power the gospel
authors sometimes acknowledge by preserving them in the origi-
nal Aramaic — such as Talitha koum (“Little girl, arise!” Mark 5:41)
or Ephphatha (“Be opened!” Mark 7:34).
Perhaps most importantly, the gospel terms for Jesus’s acts are
“sign,” “act of power,” and “wonder.” Signs, for instance, are things
that point to something else. They aren’t important in and of them-
selves in terms of the immediate event or healing; they’re impor-
tant only because they point to something bigger. As you see in the
later section, “Tying God’s Message to the Miracles in the Gospels,”
Jesus’s signs in the gospels point to the inauguration of God’s king-
dom and to Jesus’s role as its agent.
Holy Healer! How Jesus Helped
Bodies and Restored Lives
Jesus’s most common miracles involve exorcising demons and
healing the sick. A couple of accounts also claim that Jesus raised
a dead person to life. If Jesus performed any deeds of power, this
cluster of deeds, which I explain in the following sections, has the
best claim to historicity because they are reported in various inde-
pendent sources and types of material. (I discuss the modern
debate about the historicity of these miracles later in this chapter.)
These healing stories are sometimes strange for modern people in
the western world to read because for the most part, we view the
human body and illness through a biomedical model. According to
that model, the body has various parts and systems that occasion-
ally break down and require treatment. Patients today know that
the biomedical model doesn’t answer every question or heal every
problem, and that different cultures have their own working
models for how the body works and how to restore it to health.
Healing, illness, suffering, and death are “constructed” differently,
depending on your social context and worldview.
In the cultural world of the gospels, demons exist and can possess
a person. The origins of illness are rarely explored, and if they’re
referred to at all it’s often a person’s sins that are thought to be the
cause (Mark 2:1–12; John 5:14; 9:34; but see also John 9:2–3, 31). In
other words, illness has social causes and consequences in the
gospels, and the society within which it’s understood includes
human and heavenly beings.
Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
182

Driving out the Devil
Seven stories of Jesus exorcising demons are mentioned in the syn-
optic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). A couple of Q sayings
also refer to his exorcisms. I arrange these exorcisms in the follow-
ing list by source (Q, Mark, and L; see Chapter 5 for more about
these sources):
 Two mute demoniacs: These two accounts of exorcism take
place in Q and in Matthew (Q 11:14–15; Matthew 9:32–33). The
Q version is clustered with some other Q sayings in which
Jesus claims a godly origin for the power over demons (see
the nearby sidebar, “The Lord of the flies,” for details about
this debate). The Q story is a little more reliable than Matthew
9:32–33, which is basically just a copy of the Q tale that
Matthew inserts to bookend a cycle of miracle stories.
 The man with the unclean spirit: This exorcism takes place
in the synagogue at Capernaum one Sabbath Saturday (Mark
Chapter 12: Working Miracles and Confounding Crowds 183
The messianic secret
Mark’s gospel emphasizes a strange feature: It implies that Jesus wanted to keep
his messianic status a secret. For instance, when demons recognize Jesus, when
certain cures are performed, when Peter says who he thinks Jesus is, and when
Jesus is transfigured on a mountaintop, Jesus commands all the witnesses to be
silent about it.
It’s one thing to silence a shrieking demon in this way — who would trust what a
demon says anyway (Mark 1:25; 1:34; 3:12; contrast those passages with Mark
5:18–20)? But how in the world can you expect a cured leper or a little girl raised
from the dead and all her mourners to keep it quiet (Mark 1:44–45; 5:43; 7:36; 8:26;
8:30; 9:9–10)?
Various explanations have been offered: Was Jesus modest? Was he trying to keep
the crowds down and avoid the hostile attention of the authorities? A famous solu-
tion to the problem is that of William Wrede, a German Lutheran theologian
(1859–1906). Wrede thought that nobody believed Jesus was the messiah during his
lifetime but that they certainly did after his resurrection.
Wrede noticed how often in Mark 1–9 Jesus kept silencing demons and disciples who
recognized him as messiah. Wrede called this the “messianic secret” in a famous
1901 book. For Wrede, the secrecy in Mark’s gospel is the author’s awkward attempt
to blend the historical memory of a miracle worker with the post-resurrection belief
that he was also messiah and son of God. Wrede’s view is that Mark’s gospel isn’t a
historical portrait of Jesus but a theological reworking of the Jesus tradition. Whether
or not Wrede is right, it’s true that in Mark’s gospel you can’t understand who Jesus
is until the death and resurrection; until then, his true identity remains hidden.

1:23–28 || Luke 4:33–37). In this story, the spirit inside the man
shrieks that Jesus is “the holy one of God,” and Jesus silences
him. The silencing of the demon may be a Markan addition
(see the nearby sidebar, “The messianic secret,” for this motif
in Mark). But the core episode of an exorcism has a general
ring of authenticity to it because Jesus is so often shown to
perform such acts across the gospels.
 The man scrambling among the tombs in the pagan city of
Gerasa: In this exorcism story, a possessed guy is constantly
screaming and cutting himself with stones (Mark 5:1–20). The
townspeople try to chain him up, but he breaks free with the
strength of a “Legion” of demons (a not-so-veiled swipe at the
Roman army). Jesus casts the demons into a herd of pigs,
which promptly rushes headlong off a cliff into the Sea of
Galilee. The pagans panicked over the swine suicide and the
suddenly sane demoniac, and so they asked Jesus to take a
hike. There’s likely a historical kernel here, but over the years
the story has become garbled with changes (such as how far
the pigs have to run).
 The Syrophoenician woman’s daughter: In this story, a
mother whose daughter is possessed begs Jesus to cure her
(Mark 7:24–30 || Matthew 15:21–28). Because she’s a Gentile,
Jesus at first insults her: “It isn’t right to take the children’s
food and throw it to the dogs.” In other words, he’s saying
that his cures are for the Jews alone. She counters, “Even the
dogs under the table eat the children’s scraps.” For her
scrappy comeback, Jesus cures her daughter from a distance.
Did this event really happen? It’s a little suspicious, mostly
because it seems to justify the mission to the Gentiles, an out-
reach that didn’t occur until after Jesus’s death.
 The epileptic boy whom Jesus’s disciples can’t cure: While
Mark describes this boy’s affliction as demon possession, the
symptoms look a lot like an epileptic seizure: The so-called
demon throws the boy down, he foams at the mouth, he
grinds his teeth, he becomes rigid, and then he goes into
convulsions — until Jesus cures him (Mark 9:14–29). The
story is more complicated than your average exorcism: The
disciples had tried to heal the boy first, the father intervenes
rather than the child/demon, Jesus despairs of the people’s
faith, the father seems to question Jesus’s power, and details of
the boy’s symptoms are repeated three times. Because these
extra elements aren’t typical of a miracle story, and because
some of the phrasing is more Aramaic in style than good
Greek, the basic story may go back to the historical Jesus.
 Mary Magdalene: This female follower of Jesus gets seven
demons cast out of her according to Luke 8:2. But can we
believe him? Given Luke’s interests, which I describe in
Chapter 10, this report doesn’t really hold up.
Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
184

John’s gospel doesn’t include any accounts of Jesus expelling
demons from people, most likely because he doesn’t want to
diminish Jesus’s divinity by showing him constantly duking it out
with the Devil. Besides, John shows Jesus’s complete defeat of
Satan on the cross (John 1:5; 12:31–33; 16:11), so he has no need to
provide any previews.
Healing the sick
People with various maladies sought Jesus out. The most common
healings were for paralysis, blindness, and skin diseases. Some
cures were performed in public and others in private, but in every
case people quickly got wind of these amazing deeds and the
crowds continued to get bigger.
In Q, when the imprisoned John the Baptist sends his disciples to
ask Jesus if he’s the “one to come” that John had preached about,
Jesus says, “Go tell John what you have seen and heard: Blind
people see again, crippled people walk, lepers are cleansed and
deaf people hear, dead people are raised, poor people are given
good news” (Matthew 11:4–5 || Luke 7:22). That’s a pretty early wit-
ness to Jesus’s reputation, and it occurs in the literary form of a
saying. Add that literary form to the miracles stories in the follow-
ing sections, and you’ve got two literary forms (saying and story)
and several independent witnesses to healing (for the independent
witnesses and sources of the gospel traditions, see Chapters 3 and
5). Keep this Q saying in mind as you read the following sections.
Chapter 12: Working Miracles and Confounding Crowds 185
The Lord of the flies
The name Beelzebul, meaning “prince of demons,” has been around for a long time
(Mark 3:22–26; Matthew 10:25). In the Jewish scriptures, for instance, we hear of a
Philistine deity in the city of Ekron named Baalzebub, which literally means “Lord of
the flies” (2 Kings 1:2–16; William Golding borrowed this term for the title of his 1954
novel about some British schoolboys who were stranded on a tropical isle). Very
few people would likely call their god something so pejorative; it’s more likely that
the Jewish author is engaged in wordplay on the name Zabal ba’al, or “Exalted
Lord,” a divine name recently found on some Ugaritic texts. (Ugarit was a Canaanite
city that flourished in northern Syria around 1450–1200 BCE; between 1928 and 1994,
excavators found several libraries with hundreds of documents.)
The Ugaritic texts and a couple of references to zebul among the Dead Sea Scrolls
suggest another meaning of Beelzebul: “Lord of the (exalted) Abode” (that is, Lord
of Heaven). Matthew may have been punning on this meaning when he called
Beelzebul the oikodespot√n, or “despot of the house,” rather than “Lord of the
house” (Matthew 10:25).

Paralytics
The gospels contain five different stories about people with para-
lyzed limbs or withered body parts, organized in the following list
by their independent sources (Q, Mark, L, and SQ):
 The centurion’s sick servant from Capernaum: In Matthew’s
gospel, this servant is paralyzed, but in Luke and John’s he’s
simply sick and dying. Either way, Jesus heals this servant
from a distance (Q 7:1–10; compare to John 4:46–54).
 The paralyzed man from Capernaum: This man’s friends cut
a hole in the roof of a house and lower him through it so that
Jesus can cure him. After curing him, Jesus tells the man that
his sins are forgiven. The scribes are upset by Jesus’s remark
because they believe that only God can remove people’s sins
(Mark 2:1–12). We never hear whether Jesus helps the home-
owner fix the roof.
 The man with the withered hand in Capernaum: Jesus heals
this man in the synagogue on a Sabbath, supposedly flouting
the law against working on the Sabbath. This defiance leads the
Pharisees and Herodians to plot Jesus’s death (Mark 3:1–6).
 The woman who has been crippled and bent over for 18
years: Jesus lays his hands on her one Sabbath in the syna-
gogue, which immediately straightens her so she can stand
(Luke 13:10–17).
 The sick man in Bethesda: This man, who’s lying alongside
the pool of Bethesda (or Bethzatha) in Jerusalem, can’t reach
the healing waters when they stir. Jesus cures him on a
Sabbath, and the man promptly reports him to the Jewish
authorities (John 5:1–9).
Not all these individual accounts have the same claim to historic-
ity. However, recalling the saying in Q 7:22 about crippled people
walking again, you have four independent witnesses to the tradi-
tion that Jesus healed the lame (Q, Mark, L, and SQ). Add the fact
that the event is in both story and saying form, and the likelihood
that Jesus performed such cures increases.
Blind people
Three separate stories of Jesus curing blind people exist. Once
again, they’re organized in the following list by source (Mark and
SQ). In these stories, Jesus cured the following people:
 The blind man of Bethsaida: Jesus cures this man in the
Galilee (Mark 8:22–26). To cure him, Jesus takes him out of
town by the hand, spits on his eyes, and places his hands on
him. However, the cure doesn’t fully take — the guy says “I
can see people, but they look like trees walking.” After
Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
186

another try, the man’s eyes are good as new, but Jesus’s
power seems to be compromised. The embarrassment of this
story and its discontinuities with other healing stories sug-
gest that it has some degree of historicity.
 The blind Bartimaeus of Jericho: This man is cured as Jesus
travels to Jerusalem (Mark 10:46–52). Because the recipient’s
name and hometown are identified, and because of other
details of local color, several scholars think that this story has
some authenticity.
 The man who was born blind: Jesus cures this man in
Jerusalem, but he goes on to testify on behalf of Jesus before
the Jewish authorities (John 9:1–41). This cure is one of the
few that Jesus accomplishes with props, namely a poultice of
mud that he makes with his own spit. Again, the discontinuity
of this account from other healing stories suggests that it
reflects an old established story.
Recall the saying in Q 7:22 about the blind seeing? If you add that
to these stories, then you’ve got traditions about healing blindness
in three sources (Q, Mark, and SQ) and in two forms (story and
saying). That’s decent evidence, by gospel standards.
Lepers
There are two accounts of Jesus healing lepers. (See the nearby
sidebar, “The true meaning of ‘leprosy’ in Jesus’s time,” for a
description of what leprosy was like in first-century Palestine.)
I arrange these stories here by their sources (Mark and L):
 The leper in the Galilee: In an unusual display of emotion,
Jesus is “moved with pity” at the site of this man (Mark
1:40–45). He touches and cures the man and tells him to
present himself to the priest and to do the requisite sacrifices
(Leviticus 14:2–32). Jesus also tells the man not to tell anyone;
of course, the man tells everyone.
 The group of ten lepers whom Jesus cures somewhere
between Samaria and the Galilee on his way to Jerusalem:
This story is actually two fused together (Luke 17:11–19). The
first details the cure and the second focuses on the return of
one grateful Samaritan leper. The second half of this story
may be a later addition that recognizes Samaritan conversions
to Christianity after Jesus’s death (Acts 8:4–17).
It’s difficult to conclude that the specific details in these stories are
historical given that they don’t satisfy the rules of historicity in
Chapter 3. However, the saying in Q 7:22 about lepers being
cleansed and the presence of a saying and stories about curing
lepers in three sources (Q, Mark, and L) and in two forms (story
and saying) suggest a historical memory.
Chapter 12: Working Miracles and Confounding Crowds 187

Solitary cures
Five healings occur in only one gospel (that’s why I’m calling them
“solitary” cures). And, without multiple attestation of either sources
or literary forms, we don’t have a lot of evidence available to assess
their historicity. I arrange them here in terms of their sources (Mark
and L). In these stories, Jesus heals the following folks:
 Peter’s mother-in-law: Jesus cures this woman’s high fever in
Peter’s home by simply touching her (Mark 1:29–31). And
after the fever’s gone, she’s already up making dinner.
 A woman with a hemorrhage: This woman’s hemorrhage,
which had lasted for 12 years, is cured when she touches the
fringes of Jesus’s garment (Mark 5:24–34).
 A deaf-mute: Jesus heals this man by putting his fingers in the
man’s ears, spitting, touching the man’s tongue, groaning as
he looks up to heaven, and saying Ephphatha, or “Be opened!”
(Mark 7:31–37).
 A man with dropsy (swelling in the connective tissues):
Jesus cures this man on the Sabbath in the house of a leading
Pharisee (Luke 14:1–6).
 The high priest’s slave whose ear is sliced off when Jesus is
arrested: Even though all four gospels note that this man
loses his ear (Luke 22:49–51; Mark 14:47–52; Matthew
26:51–56; John 18:10–11), Luke’s gospel alone says that Jesus
heals the ear before being hauled out of Gethsemane. The
healing so clearly conforms to a preexisting story to Luke’s
interests that it’s most likely his creation.

The true meaning of “leprosy” in Jesus’s time
True leprosy or Hansen’s disease, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, is a terribly
disfiguring disease that takes about ten years to incubate and affects between 1
and 2 million people today. With this disease, tuber-shaped nodules form on the sur-
face of the body, especially on the face and in the mucous membranes (for exam-
ple, in the mouth and nose). These nodules gradually enlarge and spread, and the
nerves below them begin to die. If untreated, this disease can lead to paralysis,
wasting of muscle, and deformations.
Having said that, evidence suggests that true leprosy wasn’t actually known in the
Near East in Jesus’s time. When Greek medical doctors began to speak of true lep-
rosy, they used the terms elephas or elephantiasis. When they used the term lepra,
they generally meant any number of the exfoliative skin diseases, such as eczema
or psoriasis, just as the authors of the Torah do when they speak of the scaling or
flaking of skin as a kind of impurity (Leviticus 13–14).

Raising the dead
A special type of healing Jesus performs is when he raises people
from the dead and restores them to their normal lives. There are
three occasions of this in the gospels, arranged here by their
source (Mark, L, and SQ):
 The daughter of Jairus: This girl, who was 12 years old, had
just died when Jesus reached her home (Mark 5:21–43). Jesus
took her by the hand and said Talitha koum (“Little girl,
arise”). She got up and began walking around, and Jesus
directed her parents to give her something to eat.
 The son of the widow of Nain: In this gospel tale (Luke
7:11–17), Luke reworks a story told about the great Jewish mir-
acle-working prophet Elijah, as told in 1 Kings 17:7–24. In Luke’s
version, Jesus comes across a funeral procession. The dead
man was the only son of his mother, and his mother was a
widow (meaning that her son was her sole financial support in
her old age). Jesus touched the coffin and said, “Young man, I
say to you, arise!” He sat up immediately (we’ll presume that
there wasn’t a lid on that coffin) and started speaking.
 Lazarus, brother of Mary and Martha: Lazarus is in his tomb
four days before Jesus arrives on the scene (John 11:1–45).
Jesus tells the family to roll away the stone at the tomb’s
entrance. Understandably, they’re reluctant — and you don’t
have to watch CSI every week to guess why. Jesus cries out,
“Lazarus, come forth!” and to everyone’s shock, he does! It’s
this act of power that leads the Jewish authorities to plan
Jesus’s execution in John’s gospel (see Chapter 14 for details).
On top of these three stories, there’s the Q saying in which Jesus
tells John the Baptist’s disciples that “the dead are raised” (Q 7:22).
Because each of the stories has only one witness, and because all of
them shore up the gospels’ grand finale of Jesus’s resurrection,
there’s some skepticism among scholars about how historical any
one of these separate stories are. But as a group, the existence of
this tradition in four separate sources (Q, Mark, L, and SQ) and in
both stories and sayings suggests that Jesus’s reputation for raising
the dead dates to the time before the gospels are finally compiled.
Demonstrating Power
through Nature
Jesus’s nature miracles are always a fun topic. After all, who doesn’t
love a story in which a man mass-produces bread and fish right
before everyone’s eyes? These stories of Jesus’s deeds of power
Chapter 12: Working Miracles and Confounding Crowds 189

demonstrate his authority over nature. For the gospel authors, that
authority signals, at the very least, that God’s power works through
Jesus in a unique way. However, these stories are tough to substan-
tiate because they rarely occur in more than one source.
Providing for the people
In the gospels, Jesus occasionally performs amazing deeds that we
might call “gift miracles” — acts that provide some sort of material
benefit like food, drink, or money for the people. I arrange these
gift miracles here according to their original sources (Mark, M, L,
and SQ; see Chapter 5 for details about these sources):
 Multiplying the loaves and fishes: In this story, Jesus prays
over a few loaves of bread and a couple of fish, and suddenly
there’s enough to feed 5,000 people (Mark 6:32–44; John
6:1–15). This miracle is the only one that’s reported in all four
gospels (because Matthew and Luke follow Mark, you’re left
with two independent sources, Mark and SQ). So, even though
it echoes stories of manna in the desert (Exodus 16) and the
prophet Elisha feeding people (2 Kings 4:42–44) as well as the
language of the last supper, the rule of multiple attestation
suggests that the story might trace to a historical event.
 Providing money for the Temple tax: This miracle takes
place in Matthew 17:24–27, but take a look at Exodus 30:11–16,
which is the passage where the tax is first prescribed. In this
story, Jesus tells Peter to pay the tax by catching a fish that
will have the required coin in its mouth. Many scholars
believe that this miracle isn’t historical because it’s reported
in only one source and it’s so patently folkloric (don’t we all
wish our taxes would just pay themselves like that?).
 Filling the fish nets: In Luke’s gospel, Jesus commands Peter
(his future disciple) to head out to sea after a fishless night;
the skeptical fisherman is amazed when he hauls in a huge
catch of fish, which he immediately leaves behind to follow
Jesus (Luke 5:1–11). In John’s account, the scene plays out
after Jesus’s resurrection (John 21:1–9). Because the story
moves around in the tradition so dramatically, and because
the story serves Luke’s purpose of explaining why Peter fol-
lowed Jesus in the first place, scholars are skeptical that it
actually happened.
 Turning water into wine: When the wine runs out at a wed-
ding in Cana, Jesus saves the day by topping off everyone’s
glasses (John 2:1–12). Because only one gospel carries this
feat and it’s so heavily laden with John’s themes and theology,
scholars are reluctant to treat it as historical.
Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
190

Controlling the created world
A couple of the so-called “nature miracles” present Jesus controlling
and cursing the forces of nature. These feats are important because
they demonstrate in the gospel authors’ view that Jesus is in league
with the Creator of this world. These miracle stories include
 Stilling the storm on the Sea of Galilee: In this story, Jesus is
asleep in a boat with his disciples, sailing across the Sea of
Galilee, when a violent squall comes up (Mark 4:35–41). The
panicked disciples wake up Jesus, astonished that they’re
about to die and he’s catching a catnap. Jesus rebukes the
wind and tells the sea to quiet itself, and the squall stops. The
story is in only one independent source, it’s heavily infused
with Jewish scriptural references to God’s power over the
waters of chaos, and Jesus even takes on God’s role, which is
a loftier portrait of Jesus than Mark customarily provides. All
these factors lead scholars to the conclusion that this miracle
is a later overlay by post-resurrection Christians.
 Cursing the fig tree: In this story, Jesus curses a fig tree
before he drives out the buyers and sellers in the Temple; the
next day, the fig tree is toast (Mark 11:12–14, 20–21 || Matthew
21:18–20). This technique of splitting one story by putting a
second story in the middle is called “sandwiching.” The
“meat” in the middle of the sandwich seasons (or explains)
the “bread” on either side. Because an act of judgment against
the buyers and sellers in the Temple is in the center of the
sandwich, it means that the surrounding passages about a
barren fig tree relate to the Temple, too. And remember, Mark
is writing right about the time that the Jerusalem Temple was
destroyed by the Romans (70 CE). This curse of the fig tree is
the only punitive miracle in the gospels, and because it so
clearly signifies a judgment about the Temple, most scholars
think that it was added after the time of the historical Jesus.
Revealing Jesus
All of Jesus’s miracles reveal his power, but some of them are
strictly epiphanies or manifestations of his identity, such as
 Walking on water: After multiplying the loaves and fishes
(see the earlier section “Providing for the people”), Jesus’s
disciples are rowing against a strong wind on the Sea of
Galilee, and, to their surprise, he comes walking to them on
the water (Mark 6:45–52; John 6:16–21). You’ve got two inde-
pendent witnesses, but there are also heavy allusions to scrip-
ture. The story echoes passages about God’s walking in or on
Chapter 12: Working Miracles and Confounding Crowds 191

the sea at creation (Job 9:8; 38:16; Habakkuk 3:15; Sirach
24:5–6) and the Israelites’ walk across the dried-up Reed (or
Red) Sea in Egypt (Exodus 14:10–31; Psalm 77:19–20; Isaiah
51:10). Allusions like that suggest some heavy-duty post-resur-
rection reflection on Jesus.
 Morphing on a mountaintop: Jesus takes the disciples Peter,
James, and John up a mountain where he is transfigured
before their eyes (Mark 9:2–10). While Jesus is transfigured,
Moses and Elijah show up and stand and talk with him.
According to some old traditions, both Moses and Elijah
ascended to heaven (Deuteronomy 34:5–6; the apocryphal
Assumption [or Testament] of Moses; 2 Kings 2:11–12). Heavy
resurrection foreshadowing makes the story, as narrated, his-
torically unlikely. But it also demonstrates what the gospel
authors were trying to indicate about Jesus through this
story: that he is greater than Moses and Elijah (they aren’t in
dazzling white!) and that he, too, will rise.
Tying Jesus’s Message to the
Miracles in the Gospels
Jesus was certainly known as a miracle worker during his lifetime.
However, it’s difficult to establish that the gospel miracle stories
even occurred, let alone that they’re miracles. It’s much easier to
excavate what the gospel authors are trying to tell you through the
miracles, and it has everything to do with Jesus’s message (see
Chapter 11). Here are two of the main ideas that the authors are
trying to get across with the miracles:
 The kingdom of God is in your midst: The miracles allow the
gospel authors to express that God was working through
Jesus in a special way. Jesus’s miracles established exactly
what his teachings did — that God’s power was present on
earth in a new and authoritative way through the unique
figure of Jesus.
 God saves people: The message that Jesus demonstrated
through his miracles wasn’t some entirely new revelation.
Instead, it was a Jewish vision of salvation that was embedded
within the Law of Moses and the prophet Isaiah. Because of
God, the blind see, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the dead are
raised, and the poor have the good news preached to them
(Exodus; Leviticus 25; Isaiah 26:19; 29:18–19; 35:5–6; 61:1).
There’s a reason that Luke’s gospel has Jesus begin his public
ministry by reading from the scroll of Isaiah 58:6 and 61:1–2:
Healing, restoration of creation, and good news for the weak
Part III: Exploring the Life of Jesus the Jew 
192

were the signs that God’s kingdom had begun to come to
power. The gospels don’t just show Jesus teaching this mes-
sage. They want to show that Jesus embodied the message,
that he himself brought healing and good news to the Jewish
people.
Examining Modern Perspectives
on Miracles
The gospel authors all present Jesus as a doer of amazing deeds, a
kind of adult Harry Potter battling the forces of illness, chaos, and
death. But while everyone knows that Harry is a bona fide wizard,
Jesus’s acts of power didn’t convince everyone of his bigger mes-
sage (see the preceding section). In fact, there are still a lot of
skeptics today.
Questioning miracles during
the Enlightenment
Ever since the Enlightenment in the 18th century, and even as far
back as Jesus’s time (witness the skepticism of the Epicurean
philosophers of the Greco-Roman world; see the earlier section
“Working Wonders in Jesus’s Day”), a lot of people have questioned
whether miracles are possible. If you think the universe runs by
fixed rules or “natural laws,” as many Enlightenment thinkers did,
those rules simply can’t be broken — not even by God.
That’s why many Christians after the Enlightenment tried to figure
out “natural” explanations for the miracles in the Bible. For exam-
ple, perhaps Jesus didn’t feed 5,000 men by actually multiplying five
loaves of bread and two fish; maybe, instead, he encouraged every-
one to share their loaves (you can read about this so-called fish tale
in Mark 6:32–44 and John 6:1–15). Tweaking the account in this way
preserves the “truth” of the story by taking out what’s presumed to
be untrue, namely those things that don’t make sense in terms of
modern science. Some people went further and discarded Jesus’s
miracles altogether, thinking them to be flat-out impossible. For
these folks, Jesus’s enduring reputation is based on his ethical
teaching rather than on these “overblown” acts of power.
Historians who study the historical Jesus often inherit the
Enlightenment’s skepticism. After all, if a historian is going to argue
that something happened, she wants to show you evidence for it.
And some of the issues that historians come across simply can’t be
Chapter 12: Working Miracles and Confounding Crowds 193

proven with evidence. For example, I can prove to you that there
are grounds for saying that people believed Jesus performed cer-
tain healings and exorcisms. What I can’t prove to you is the cause
of these cures, particularly if you want proof of a supernatural
cause. For one thing, matters divine lie beyond the mundane realm
where historians work. You need theologians and philosophers to
deal with those issues. But more importantly, remember this: To
prove anything today, you need evidence that everyone can agree
on, and according to the gospels, even Jesus himself couldn’t pro-
duce that (Mark 3:20–22; 8:11–13; 15:29–32; Luke 16:19–31). To
believe something is an act of God is a matter of faith, not a matter
of fact, and no matter how secure and certain one’s faith is, it’s
best not to confuse the two.
Deciding whether Jesus’s miracles
are historical
If you apply the ground rules of historicity from Chapter 3 to
Jesus’s miracles, you find that the miracles in general, and the
healing miracles in particular (see the earlier section “Holy Healer!
How Jesus Helped Bodies and Restored Lives”), are among the
most well-attested events associated with Jesus’s life. Reports of
healings and exorcisms occur in miracle stories and in sayings —
two different forms. On top of that, these stories occur in multiple
independent sources, from Q and Mark to the special Matthean
and Lukan material and John’s “signs source” (often referred to as
M, L, and SQ; see Chapter 5 for more on these sources), as well as
the Jewish historian Josephus. And finally, these reports are con-
sistent with other historical details of Jesus’s teaching, such as his
emphasis on God’s action to restore people and raise the poor.
Not every scholar agrees with this judgment. Many begin with the
assumption that miracles are impossible (see the preceding sec-
tion) and read the gospel miracles as post-resurrection myths that
were inserted into the story of Jesus. This group believes that as
the early church came to view Jesus as the son of God, it added
miracles to make Jesus resemble the divine men of the Greco-
Roman world.
There’s no doubt that the gospels magnify Jesus’s miraculous
power. But with miracle references occurring in every source and
in every type of gospel material, it strikes me that there’s some his-
torical fire behind this miraculous smoke. As a historian, I can’t tell
you that Jesus’s acts of power were miracles, but I can tell you that
Jesus performed deeds of power that were (and are) viewed by
some people as miracles, and that the gospels present these acts
as central to his life’s work.

Part IV
Witnessing Jesus’s
Execution and
Resurrection

In this part . . .
T
he story of Jesus’s death is central to the gospel
accounts. In fact, the earliest gospel, Mark, devotes a
full third of its pages to Jesus’s ﬁnal week in Jerusalem.
When the authors invest so much energy in their account,
it’s clear that they have a lot at stake in the outcome. So
it’s all the more important to ask the question that moti-
vates this book: How well do the gospel stories about
Jesus’s death and resurrection stand up to historical
scrutiny?
In this part, I show you the power pyramid in Palestine so
you can see who had it out for Jesus and why. I explain
who the gospel writers thought Jesus’s enemies were, and
I give you the chance to evaluate this testimony against
history. Also in this part are the facts regarding the grue-
some Roman practice of cruciﬁxion. I give you an up-close
look at Jesus’s last week and his arrest and execution.
Finally, I tell the stories of Jesus’s resurrection from the
dead and trace how that event transformed Christian
beliefs about Jesus in the ﬁrst 500 years of Christianity.

Jesus’s Opponents
In This Chapter
 Exposing the power dynamics in Palestine
 Discovering the Roman rulers’ concerns
 Sifting through the objections of different Jewish groups
 Surveying the disappointment of Jesus’s family and friends
 Considering Jesus’s ultimate opponent
A
s most folks know, the story of Jesus ends badly. After being
betrayed by one of his closest friends and abandoned by the
others, Jesus was tortured and executed by an alliance of Jewish
aristocrats and the Roman prefect in Jerusalem sometime around
30–32 CE. His death by crucifixion is one of the most reliable his-
torical details of his life. So, any account of his life must paint a
plausible picture of why this charismatic teacher and healer was
viewed as a threat.
In this chapter, you discover the power pyramid in Jesus’s time, you
unearth each power player’s motives for opposing or eliminating
Jesus, you investigate the concerns that his own family and friends
had about him, and you ponder why the gospel authors shift the
blame to the wrong people when they tell the story of Jesus.
Scanning the Power Pyramid
in Palestine
The gospels give the impression that several Jewish groups — the
Pharisees, the scribes, the priests, the elders, the Sadducees, and
the high priest — teamed up to take Jesus out. They all conspired
to test him, trap him, arrest him, and turn him over to the Romans.
This conspiracy makes it seem like all these groups had equal

Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection 
198
power and shared motives, and that the ruling Romans or
Herodians were governed by them. However, that wasn’t the case.
The historical picture flips that impression upside down. Society was
organized hierarchically, like a pyramid. Needless to say, the Roman
Emperor Tiberius was on top (see Chapter 6 for more on him). Below
him were two parallel pyramids in Palestine, the southern and the
northern (see Chapters 7 and 8 for more about the politics in these
regions). Here’s the lowdown on these two regions:
 The southern pyramid of Judea–Samaria–Idumea: After 6
CE, Judea, Samaria, and Idumea came under the jurisdiction of
a Roman prefect (see Chapters 6 and 8). The prefect picked a
Jew to serve as high priest, who was the closest thing the
south had to a native leader. The high priest worked with the
local aristocrats, a group that included the Sadducees, the
elders, and some of the wealthy priestly families. These
groups employed a police force, toll collectors, scribes, and
various other bureaucrats to run things.
The Pharisees, another group that had been politically power-
ful in the past, were largely sidelined by this arrangement.
They had opposed the Sadducees during the Hasmonean
period (164–37 BCE), so when Rome sidled up to the
Sadducees and aristocrats, the Pharisees were on the losing
side of the equation. They had to content themselves with
trying to shape popular piety and practice in Judea. (There’s
more on each of these groups later in the chapter.)
 The northern pyramid of Galilee–Perea: Regions with rela-
tively effective Jewish client kings, like Galilee–Perea under the
tetrarch Herod Antipas, weren’t directly annexed and adminis-
tered by Rome, but they fell under Rome’s political umbrella.
Like the Judean high priest, Herod had his own cohort of
soldiers, scribes, and toll collectors to do his bidding.
In both regions, the common people made up the vast majority —
perhaps 85–95 percent of the population. Jesus came from this
stratum of the northern pyramid in the Galilee. In the south, the
politically marginalized Pharisees worked in this stratum as well.
At the bottom of the pyramid in both regions were the landless and
impoverished. Check out the whole power pyramid in Figure 13-1.
The interests of the gospel authors shaped their portraits of Jesus’s
enemies, so that the gospel versions of who’s who in the power pyra-
mid differ from Figure 13-1. Because of this, the gospels are, at best,
opaque windows into the historical Jesus’s actual enemies and the
actual causes of his death (I take up the death of Jesus in Chapter 14).

Chapter 13: Scouting the Competition: Jesus’s Opponents 199
Figure 13-1: The power pyramid during Jesus’s ministry.
Forty years or so after Jesus’s death, right about the time the gospel
authors began to write their stories, the Romans destroyed the
Jerusalem Temple during a Jewish revolt (see Chapter 8 for more on
this uprising). Gone was the Temple, gone was the need for a high
priest, and gone was most of the Jerusalem aristocracy. With the
Jewish leadership in the penalty box (or actually, out of the game
entirely), the Pharisees and their heirs stepped into the leadership
vacuum. Their interpretation of Jewish tradition gradually became
a dominant voice, and these events had an impact on the gospel
stories. For example:
 The Pharisees loom larger as Jesus’s opponents than they
likely were in his life, because they were the gospel authors’
opponents (John 12:42; see also John 9:13–41).
 The members of the Jerusalem aristocracy, who played an
important role in the historical Jesus’s death, are also blamed
for the destruction of the Temple (the gospels tie the execution
of Jesus to the destruction of the Temple).
 The Roman role in Jesus’s death is reduced in order to highlight
the inner-Jewish issues, to differentiate Christians from the
recently rebellious Jews, and to position Jesus as a victim of
conquered Judaism rather than an enemy of victorious Rome.

Starting at the Top: The Romans
It’s a safe bet that the people who actually executed Jesus can be
counted among his opponents. So the central question is: What
threat did Jesus actually pose to Rome? After all, according to the
gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, he spent most of his time in the
Galilee, and the Romans weren’t in charge there. In the following
sections, I explain how the Romans used crucifixion in their empire,
and I examine the threat that Jesus posed to them.
The reasons for Roman crucifixion
Two certain facts about the historical Jesus are established inde-
pendently by Christian, Jewish, and Roman sources: Jesus was cru-
cified and only the Romans could crucify. Whatever picture we
paint of Jesus’s opponents has to fit that backdrop.
The Romans reserved crucifixion for those subjects who were not
Roman citizens and who were seen as enemies of Rome, either
because of banditry, murder, or outright treason. Crucifixion
wasn’t a private or swift affair. The accused criminal was stripped
naked and hung or nailed onto a crossbeam immediately outside
one of the main city gates. It usually took hours, if not days, for the
accused to die. This event was a kind of living Roman billboard
that advertised what would happen if anyone else tried to take on
Rome (see Chapter 14 for more on Jesus’s crucifixion).
The threat Jesus posed
If Jesus was killed by Rome as a warning to other would-be bandits
and rebels, does that mean that he was one himself? Was that the
threat he posed? Not necessarily.
The gospels say that Jesus was killed during Passover, one of the
three great annual pilgrimage festivals (check out Chapters 2 and 7
for more on Passover and festivals). The pilgrimages drew huge
crowds to Jerusalem to celebrate the liberation of Israel from
Egypt (Exodus 1–15). In that context, setting off a crowd wouldn’t
take much. And surely Rome wouldn’t need much provocation to
step in and quell the unrest. If enough people so much as hoped
that Jesus might be ushering in God’s reign — which they seemed to
do when Jesus entered Jerusalem (Mark 11:1–10; John 12:12–19) —
Rome’s prefect, Pontius Pilate, would have intervened with force to
make an example of the would-be messiah.
The interesting historical question is whether Jesus himself encour-
aged the crowds to hail him as the messiah. His core teaching was

that God’s kingdom was coming soon and that it alone offered true
justice, peace, and good news to the people (see Chapter 11 for
more on Jesus’s teachings). If Rome knew what Jesus was saying,
they would not have been amused. But did Jesus think that the reign
of God was his to usher in? Did he promote rebellion against Rome?
These questions would be tough to square with the gospels.
Various traditions of a nonviolent Jesus occur in multiple sources
(Q, Mark, John) and literary forms (miracle story, controversy sto-
ries, and sayings). In fact, the gospels go to great lengths to convey
that Jesus wasn’t interested in attacking Rome and seizing earthly
power. For example, the gospels do the following:
 They show Jesus rejecting worldly power in the temptation
scene (Matthew 4:8–10 || Luke 4:5–8).
 They present him teaching people to love their enemies
(Matthew 5:43–48 || Luke 6:27–28, 32–36).
 They tell how he redefined “messiah” as someone who would
suffer and die (Mark 8:31–38), not as someone who would gain
territory and power (Mark 10:35–45).
 They show him healing a centurion’s servant (Q 7:1–10),
dining with toll collectors (Mark 2:13–17), and supporting
Roman taxes (though the support is cleverly qualified; Mark
12:13–17).
 They contrast him to the political rebel Barabbas whom
Pontius Pilate released instead (Mark 15:6–14; John 18:39–40).
Also important is the fact that nobody made a move on Jesus until
that one fateful Passover in Jerusalem. The tetrarch Herod Antipas
never arrested him, so he clearly didn’t view Jesus as a political
threat. If you accept the chronology of Jesus’s ministry in John’s
gospel, you know that Jesus visited Jerusalem for the pilgrimage
festivals several times — and the Romans never once seized him on
those earlier trips. Even the Romans apparently didn’t view him as
a threat until the crowd began to view him as their liberator. And
when they arrested him, they arrested only him, not his followers.
Had his movement been violent, Rome would have killed them all.
Many Christians over the past two millennia have preached, taught,
and believed that the entire Jewish people killed Christ. They read
Matthew’s gospel, where the crowd cries, “His blood be on us and
on our children” (Matthew 27:25) as a perpetual curse and a
sentence that they had an obligation to execute. But this reading
just doesn’t make any historical sense. If Rome’s reason to execute
Jesus wasn’t what he said or did but what the Jewish crowd hoped
he would do, the gospel’s portrait of bloodthirsty Jewish crowds
crying for Jesus’s crucifixion quickly evaporates. The crowds were,
in a sense, responsible for Jesus’s death, but it was because they
Chapter 13: Scouting the Competition: Jesus’s Opponents 201

Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection 
202
supported him, not because they opposed him. What deterrent
power would Rome’s crucifixion of Jesus have had if the Jewish
crowds themselves had asked for it? None! Instead, the crowds were
essentially the targets of the crucifixion as much as Jesus was.
Near the Center of Power: 
The Sadducees
The Sadducees were a group of priestly and lay aristocrats who
were close to the pinnacle of local power in Judea during Jesus’s life.
The Sadducees were characterized by their political role, their eco-
nomic status, and their particular religious beliefs. They opposed
Jesus on all these grounds, as you find out in the following sections.
Aristocratic allegiances
The Sadducees originated some time during the Hasmonean
monarchy as opponents of the Pharisees (see Chapter 7). Their for-
tunes had waxed and waned depending on who was in power.
When Herod the Great assumed the throne in 37 BCE, for example,
he marginalized and intimidated them, preferring to appoint
non–Judean Jews to sensitive positions, such as the high priest-
hood, so that his appointees would be beholden to him rather than
to powerful local families.
However, the Roman annexation of 6 CE led to a newfound respect
for the Sadducees. They became Rome’s allies in the region and
the customary candidate pool for its high priests (such as Annas
and Caiaphas, for example; see John 18:13–14, 19–24).
The Jewish historian Josephus wasn’t very fond of the Sadducees. In
fact, in his works, he notes that the common people didn’t admire
the Sadducees either; he says they were “the first men” (meaning the
leading citizens), were always arguing amongst themselves, and had
“the confidence of the wealthy alone,” the wealthy being a group
made up largely of themselves (Jewish Antiquities 13.10.6; 18.1.4;
Jewish War 2.8.14). According to Josephus, the Pharisees were much
more popular (he would say that, because he claimed to be one!).
That popularity could be threatening for the Sadducees, because
anyone who challenged their religious authority or who brought on
social change threatened a power pyramid from which they benefited.
The term “Sadducee” is used sparingly in the gospels, but the sorts
of people who composed that group are heavily featured in the
Jerusalem scenes. For instance, according to Mark, Matthew, and
Luke, soon after Jesus enters Jerusalem, he comes under attack by
the “chief priests” and the “elders” (Mark 11:18, 27; Matthew 21:23;

Luke 19:47; 20:1). Luke adds references to the “rulers” (Luke 23:13,
35; 24:20) and to the “first men” (Luke 19:47). These references are
reminiscent of Josephus’s description of the Sadducees. They chal-
lenge Jesus’s authority, they plot his arrest, they try him themselves
and then accuse him before Pontius Pilate, and they mock him at
the cross. Josephus independently confirms this scenario when he
says that Pilate crucified Jesus “when he heard him accused by the
first men among us” (Jewish Antiquities 18.3.3; see Chapter 5).
It isn’t clear that these chief priests, elders, rulers, and first men in
the gospels were all Sadducees. They didn’t necessarily share
Sadducean religious beliefs, so when the gospels present these
folks conspiring against Jesus for religious reasons, they’re over-
simplifying the situation. The groups did share political alliances
and economic interests, which is why they didn’t want anyone
upsetting the apple cart.
The chief priests featured as Jesus’s opponents were just a small,
leading group of priests. They didn’t represent or reflect the inter-
ests of all Jewish priests in the region. Priests were sprinkled
across the economic spectrum (refer to Figure 13-1). Most lived in
Judea to be near the Temple, but others were scattered throughout
the country (Mark 1:44; Luke 1:5). In his book, Against Apion,
Josephus reports that there were 20,000 Jewish priests in total,
which, if true, would be perhaps 4 percent of the overall popula-
tion (Against Apion 2.8).
Conservative religious beliefs
The Sadducees didn’t only play a political and an economic role —
they were also a religious group. They were Jewish and considered
themselves guardians of the Jewish tradition, but they did have
some beliefs that differed from other Jewish groups. Josephus tells
more about the Sadducees’ beliefs than the gospels do, but given
his bias against them, you want to be careful when swallowing the
bait. Josephus says, for instance, that the Sadducees
 Rejected the Pharisees’ “traditions of the elders” (these tradi-
tions aren’t in the Torah but are often interpretations of Torah
commands).
 Believed in human free will, not in fate or divine providence.
This belief is tough to square with God’s frequent interventions
in the Torah, so Josephus must be oversimplifying.
 Accepted only the Torah as normative, not the prophets or
writings. This meant that they rejected the Pharisees’ belief in
the resurrection of the dead, which was based on the Pharisees’
interpretations of scriptures in the prophets and the writings
(such as 1 Samuel 2:6; Isaiah 26:19; Job 19:26; Daniel 12:1–3).
Chapter 13: Scouting the Competition: Jesus’s Opponents 203

Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection 
204
In the gospels, the Sadducees take only one shot at Jesus, and it’s a
doctrinal challenge. They didn’t believe in the resurrection of the
dead, and Jesus (and the Pharisees) did. So they posed a hypothetical
scenario that in their minds made belief in resurrection absurd
(Mark 12:18–27). A man dies childless, so according to the Jewish
law of levirate marriage his brother marries the widow to produce
an heir for the dead husband (Deuteronomy 25:5). When he dies,
another brother steps in, and so on until seven brothers have
died, followed by the wife. The Sadducees ask, “In the resurrection,
whose wife will she be?” Jesus replies that the joke’s on them
because risen bodies are more like angels than humans, so marriage
is irrelevant to them. But more importantly, Jesus argues that resur-
rection is grounded in the Torah and not in later tradition (he refers
to the burning bush story in Exodus 3:6, where God calls himself the
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob — as if those great Israelite patri-
archs were still alive).The upshot of the gospel argument is that the
Sadducees aren’t as expert as they think.
Did this exchange between the Sadducees and Jesus really
happen? Well, for starters, it’s only in one source — Mark — and in
one literary form — the controversy story. But it would be an odd
thing for later Christians to introduce, because the Sadducees had
ceased to exist at the time Mark was likely writing. According to
the rule of discontinuity, a tradition is more reliable if it’s clear that
the early Christians had no reason to add it. On that same princi-
ple, no later Christian group uses the burning bush story to
“prove” the resurrection — further recommending that the evan-
gelists didn’t make it up. Finally, this teaching about the resurrec-
tion is coherent with Q sayings about a final banquet or judgment
at which the dead and living would appear (Q 11:31–32; 13:28–29).
So, while there’s only one source for this encounter with the
Sadducees, several other criteria are satisfied, making it likely.
Singling out the Scribes
Out of all the Jewish groups that opposed Jesus on religious
grounds, the scribes were the odd men out. Why? They weren’t a
religious group! It would be like saying that a holy man came to
town and all the notary publics started taking faith-based swipes at
him. The more likely historical scenario is that only some of these
scribes had it in for Jesus, as you find out in the following sections.
A scribe’s role in the first century
As the name suggests, scribes were writers in the societies that had
low literacy rates (perhaps 5 to 7 percent of the general population

could read and write). The scribes in first-century Palestine
weren’t necessarily religious experts at all. They weren’t all trained
in the Torah or in Jewish ethics. The scribes operated at all social
levels, from rural villages to Herod Antipas’s capital in Tiberias to
the Jerusalem Temple (refer to Figure 13-1 to see where they stood
in terms of power). Where the scribes worked determined what
they wrote. Here’s a rundown of their duties:
 Your average village scribe wrote everything from marriage
contracts to loan records.
 The scribes working in administrative centers copied court
decisions, council minutes, commercial contracts, and other
such records that would be kept on file at a public building.
 The scribes working at the highest echelons, like in Herod’s
court, would compose official records, histories, diplomatic
correspondence, and literature.
 The scribes who were trained in religious texts and traditions
would have a close knowledge of Jewish scripture and law,
and they composed a good bit of it themselves.
Historically, scribes were more of a mixed lot than the synoptic
gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke portray. The earliest manu-
scripts of John’s gospel don’t mention scribes at all.
The gospels’ proverbial pests
The scribes are out to get Jesus pretty early on in Mark’s gospel.
Several come up to the Galilee from Jerusalem to investigate him
(Mark 3:22; 7:1, 5), but some local scribes also challenge his authority
(Mark 1:22; 2:6, 16). In the Galilee, the scribes are most often paired
with the Pharisees (see the next section for more about the
Pharisees). At one point, Mark actually says that some of them
belong to the Pharisaic group (Mark 2:16).
After Jesus gets to Jerusalem, scribes are mentioned in league with
Jesus’s aristocratic opponents, such as with the chief priests and
elders (see Mark 11:18, 27; 12:35, 38; 14:1, 43, 53; 15:1, 31).
Together, they convict Jesus on the charge of blasphemy (viewing
his authority equal to God’s), which the scribes had already once
convicted him of in Mark 2:6–7.
Matthew generally doesn’t like the scribes either. He occasionally
adds scribes to Mark’s negative stories about the Pharisees, whom
he liked even less (Matthew 12:38 || Mark 8:11). Matthew even
changes Mark’s single sympathetic portrait of a scribe into a hostile
exchange with a Pharisaic lawyer (Matthew 22:34–35 || Mark 12:28).
However, Matthew did mention Christian scribes, so apparently
Chapter 13: Scouting the Competition: Jesus’s Opponents 205

Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection 
206
they weren’t all bad (Matthew 13:52; 23:34). Luke also mentions the
scribes as Jesus’s enemies (Luke 9:22; 19:47; 20:1, 19; 22:2, 54, 66;
23:1, 10).
The free hand that the gospel authors take when selecting oppo-
nents for any given scene tells you that we aren’t operating with
historical episodes here, but instead with animosities and religious
positions that have grown and changed since the time of Jesus.
Historically, unlike the aristocrats, the scribes had no power to do
anything to Jesus. They derived their power from those they
worked for.
Up for Debate: The Pharisees
The Pharisees enjoyed political power during the Hasmonean 
period in 164–37 BCE, but by Jesus’s time the Roman prefects and
the Sadducees had largely sidelined them (I discuss these groups 
earlier in this chapter). Some of the Pharisees were aristocratic and
prominent, but the majority of them during Jesus’s life exercised
power only by virtue of their broad appeal to the common people.
That’s the same segment of the population that the historical Jesus
sought to influence, so you find Jesus and the Pharisees scuffling
frequently over points of law. But the gospel authors transform
these historical scuffles into serious battles that lead directly to
Jesus’s death, for reasons that I explain in the following sections.
The Pharisees’ different interpretation
of the Torah
The Pharisees were fairly liberal when it came to their interpreta-
tion of scripture. The gospels denounce their traditions as so many
additional “heavy burdens” that people had to bear (Q 11:46). But
the Pharisees viewed these practices as paths to purity, which was
now available not just to priests but to all Jews. And in any case,
Jesus’s positions on the law often looked even heavier (see Figure
13-2). The Pharisees admitted that their practices weren’t in the
Torah; instead they were post-biblical “traditions of the elders” that
were worth passing on (Mark 7:3, 5; Josephus, Jewish Antiquities
13.10.6). In the same way, Jesus would claim an authority beyond
Mosaic law — although in his case, the authority is himself!
The Pharisees didn’t consider their rules binding on Jews. They
only considered them binding on those people who joined their
group. The gospels, on the other hand, picture the Pharisees in
just the opposite way, as harsh judges of anyone who wasn’t as
righteous as they were. The gospels make it sound like the
Pharisees flat-out opposed Jesus on every interpretation of the law.

But the historical picture is actually more three-dimensional: The
Pharisees probably disagreed with Jesus on some points of law
and agreed with him on others (see the next section).

Pharisees.

The issues with the gospels’
portrayal of the Pharisees
The gospel portraits of the Pharisees suffer from the same problem
as the scribes (whom I discuss earlier in this chapter): From one
gospel to the next, parallel stories often feature different opponents.
For instance, on at least four occasions Matthew copied a story
about scribes from Mark, but he changed the scribes to Pharisees.
To see for yourself, compare:
 Matthew 9:11 with Mark 2:16
 Matthew 9:34 and 12:34 with Mark 3:22
 Matthew 21:45 with Mark 11:27 and 12:12
 Matthew 22:34–35 with Mark 12:28
And John’s gospel doesn’t even mention chief priests, scribes, and
elders. In his gospel, the Pharisees are the ruling Jews (John 9:13–22;
12:42)!
Another reason for the gospels’ enmity with the Pharisees is that
the Pharisees shared a lot of interests with the historical Jesus and
early Christians. In fact, they were largely courting the same audi-
ence, at least at first. Here’s a list of some of the similarities
between Jesus and the Pharisees:
 Both the historical Jesus and the Pharisees cared deeply
about God, Temple, and Torah.
 Both apparently believed in the resurrection of the dead
(Josephus, Jewish War 2.8.14; Jewish Antiquities 18.1.3; implied
in Mark 12:18–27; see Acts 23:6–9).
 Both cared about ethical practice, but they sometimes differed
on the details (see the preceding section).
Rabbinic Judaism, which gradually became the dominant form of
Judaism after the destruction of the Temple, traced its origins to
the Pharisees. In their books, you find the rabbis often disagreeing
with each other. That kind of conversation, full of wit and learning
and occasional rancor, is the sort of debate that the historical
Jesus most likely had with the Pharisees. The dialogue occurs
because the law matters, not because scripture is being rejected.
The shifting targets of the gospel authors’ wrath make their stories
about Jesus’s opponents tough to confirm. On top of that, the
gospels’ characterization of the Pharisees’ teaching is highly argu-
mentative and anachronistic and therefore not completely reliable;
it’s more continuous with the early church than discontinuous (see

Chapter 3 for more on the rules of historicity). Besides, if the
Pharisees were as bitterly opposed to Jesus as the gospels say,
why do some of them join the early Christian movement
(Philippians 3:5; Acts 15:5)?
The general notion that some Pharisees opposed Jesus is plausible
enough, however, because quarrelsome Pharisees are mentioned in
multiple sources and types of stories. Most of the historical Pharisees
lived in Judea, so their opposition to Jesus likely took place there
and was written into the Galilean period of Jesus’s ministry by Mark.
Otherwise, you’d have to imagine that the Pharisees, who by and
large lived in Judea, made multiple trips to the Galilee just to take
on this religious upstart. One additional piece of evidence in favor
of this view is that the gospel of John, which mentions Pharisees 20
times, always places them in Judea. In the synoptic gospels, the
Pharisees pretty much drop off the stage after the real pursuit of
Jesus begins in Jerusalem, which reflects the historical fact that
they probably had nothing to do with his death.
Evading the Herodians
Mark’s gospel mentions the Herodians twice. These folks plot with
the Pharisees to put Jesus to death before he has really done any-
thing controversial (Mark 3:6; Matthew 12:14 and Luke 6:11 both
drop the Herodians). They reemerge only one other time in the
gospels, and once again they’re conspiring with the Pharisees to
trap Jesus. This time, they challenge Jesus directly with a question
about whether the Jews should pay taxes to Caesar (Mark 12:13–17;
Luke 20:20–26 has the story but again drops the Herodians).
It isn’t clear who these Herodians are, and it’s even less clear whether
they were really out to get Jesus. The best guess is that they were
partisans or even high-level bureaucrats and servants who worked
for Herod Antipas, tetrarch of the Galilee and Perea of the northern
power pyramid (see Chapter 7 for more on Herod Antipas).
One thing we do know for sure is that Herod Antipas never went
after Jesus, as he did against John the Baptist. Apparently, Jesus
didn’t threaten Herod as much as John did. After all, it’s simply too
difficult to imagine that the guy at the peak of the northern power
pyramid failed to act against a political threat. So, that means we can
assume that Jesus wasn’t actually a threat. He wasn’t perceived as
messiah up north, he wasn’t challenging the economic and political
status quo substantially, and he wasn’t drawing massive crowds
like John had.

Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection 
210
Alienating Relatives, Neighbors,
and Disciples
People don’t usually think of Jesus’s relatives as his opponents,
but several hints in the gospels indicate that they weren’t always
in his corner. Sure, his mother Mary and father Joseph are praised
in the stories of Jesus’s infancy, but these infancy accounts are
latecomers to the gospel story and historically aren’t very reliable
(Matthew 1–2; Luke 1–2; see Chapter 9 for more on Jesus’s infancy
and family).
The other books that mention Mary in a positive light are equally
late. For example, Luke’s second volume, The Acts of the Apostles,
places Mary with the surviving 11 of the Twelve disciples in the
Upper Room after Jesus’s death (Acts 1:14). John’s gospel places
her at both Jesus’s first great sign where he turns water to wine
(John 2:1–12) and at the beginning of his last sign — the cross and
resurrection (John 19:25–37).
If you play the history game, the earlier sources matter more. And it’s
in these early sources that Jesus’s family, neighbors, and disciples
get the worst press.
Turning away from family
The earliest sources, Q and Mark, paint a relatively negative portrait
of Jesus’s family. In both sources, this negative portrait functions to
underscore that the only family that counts is the family of God.
Missing family meals
Mark recounts that when Jesus went home, such a huge crowd
gathered that “they were unable even to eat bread” (Mark 3:20).
When Jesus’s relatives heard of this, they set out to seize him
because they thought that he was out of his mind (Mark 3:21). It
sounds even worse when you discover that the Greek verb Mark
uses for “seize” is the same one he uses for the guys who haul
Jesus off to jail in Mark 14:43–50. No wonder this is one of only
three passages in Mark that neither Matthew nor Luke pick up
(especially the way they praise Jesus’s parents in their infancy sto-
ries)! It isn’t clear who these relatives are, but the mother, broth-
ers, and sisters are introduced a few verses later (Mark 3:31–35).
Gaining new friends and family
Jesus teaches that you must love him or God more than your own
family (Q 12:49–53 and 14:25–33; Mark 10:17–22). In fact, there’s a

story about how Jesus rejects biological kin in favor of the fictive
family of disciples sitting at his feet, whose members do the will of
Jesus and God (Mark 3:31–35; John 15:14 paints the disciples as
friends rather than family). It seems pretty clear in these early
sources that Jesus’s biological family was outside his inner circle
during his adult life. That impression is strengthened when you
take into account that Jesus made Capernaum rather than his
hometown of Nazareth his base camp.
The slighting of Jesus’s family members in the gospels is all the
more interesting because they played such a huge role after his
death. Jesus’s brother James, for example, was an early leader of
the Jerusalem Church, renowned among the Jews for his piety (see
Chapter 9 for more on this James). And the portrait of Jesus’s
mother improves in later gospel material.
Offending the hometown crowd
Besides alienating his family, Jesus offended the people he grew up
with. A story in Mark recounts how his fellow Nazarenes took
offense to his wisdom and healings, as if he were overstepping his
humble roots (Mark 6:1–6). Jesus considers the offense and raises
them one, saying, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his
own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.”
Slam dunk! Luke adds that the townsfolk didn’t take the insult well
and tried to throw Jesus off a cliff (Luke 4:28–30).
Scandalizing the disciples
Jesus even occasionally shocked and insulted the disciples. For
instance:
 When Peter tried to convince Jesus that he didn’t have to die,
Jesus called him Satan (Mark 8:33); and as insults go, it doesn’t
get much worse than that!
 Judas, a member of the Twelve, took so much offense at Jesus
that he decided to hand him over to the authorities (Mark
14:10–11), which ties him to Satan, too (John 6:70–71).
 When Jesus teaches in John’s gospel that he’s the “bread of
life” that his disciples must eat, many of his disciples are
shocked by the metaphor and can’t accept it, so they leave
Jesus and return to their former ways of life (John 6:60–66).
Chapter 13: Scouting the Competition: Jesus’s Opponents 211

The Ultimate Opponent
in the Gospels: Satan
There’s one final opponent of Jesus that historians don’t usually
mention because he can’t be proven. But in the gospel authors’
worldview, this opponent is the mother of them all. Call him Satan,
Beelzebul, or the prince of darkness — he’s the force behind the
opposition to Jesus. He’s the invisible power pyramid lurking
beneath the visible authorities that are arrayed against Jesus.
In some ways, the discussion of the exorcisms and even healings in
Chapter 12 fits in this chapter. In those stories, Jesus demonstrates
a power over evil, illness, and death in the same way that he bests
his earthly opponents in the examples in this chapter. In fact, when
the gospel authors say a lawyer or Pharisee sets out to “test”
Jesus, they’re using the same word in Greek that’s used of Satan in
the temptation scene (Matthew 4:1; 19:3; 22:18, 35). But Jesus sur-
vives all of these tests, ultimately defeating Satan’s death grip by
dying and rising from the dead (John 12:31–33; 16:11).

T
he steady drumbeat of opposition to Jesus throughout the
gospels builds to a climax by the end of the story. Jesus visits
Jerusalem with throngs of other pilgrims one Passover, and within a
week he’s dead after being crucified by the Roman authorities. In this
chapter, you discover the political purpose of crucifixion, you join
Jesus for his triumphal entry into the city, you witness his final hours,
and you assess the gospel portraits to see how historical they are.
Crucifixion in the Time
of the Romans
By the time of Jesus, the Romans had adopted crucifixion as a
common death penalty for low-level criminals. The manner of
death was so gruesome and humiliating that it became an effective
deterrent for Rome’s enemies and a favored penalty for Rome’s
rulers, as I explain in the following sections.

Advertising Rome’s power
Rome used crucifixion to prove who was boss, and it reserved this
gruesome torture for its worst enemies — those who dared to
challenge the pax romana (Roman peace) through banditry, theft,
and rebellion. But given the public nature of crucifixion, the target
audience was also the general population. People couldn’t avoid
seeing Rome’s victims even if they wanted to. Rome counted on
this as a deterrent to future unrest. As you can see, crucifixion 
was one of Rome’s most effective propaganda techniques.
The Romans wouldn’t just crucify anybody. It all depended on social
class and what crime had been committed. Crucifixion was consid-
ered to be such an obscene form of execution that Roman citizens
and the “well-born” were usually exempt. This death penalty was
meted out only to the lowest classes, such as the slaves, thieves,
rebels, and brigands.
Developing new ways 
to inflict agony
The Romans didn’t invent crucifixion, but they developed quite a
reputation for using it. According to the Greek historian Herodotus
(400s BCE), the first people on record for using the practice were
the Medes and the Persians. However, some credit the Egyptians.
In any case, it isn’t until the Roman period that we get detailed
accounts of the gruesome variations on a theme that the Romans
had devised. According to the Roman philosopher and statesman
Seneca (first century CE), the convicted person could be impaled on
a stake or tied or nailed to a tree or beam with arms stretched out
to the sides or above the head (see Figure 14-1). He could be hung
upside down, trussed right-side up with a stake through his genitals,
or hung from his shoulders with legs broken so that he couldn’t
support his weight (Seneca, To Marcia on Consolation 20.3). When a
person was hung from the shoulders, the pressure on the two sets of
muscles needed for breathing — the intercostal muscles and the
diaphragm — was intense. The muscles gradually weakened until the
person was asphyxiated.
Victims were flogged in advance so they would die more quickly
when crucified (and even then it could take days). Also, the Romans
always stripped the victims (the loincloth in Jesus’s case is a
respectful artistic addition) and positioned them in a public place
just outside the city walls, near the main road into the city. Birds
would peck at the bodies, and when they were finally removed from
the wood, the corpses were tossed to dogs or dumped into mass
graves.

The Main Players in Charge
When Jesus Was Crucified
In Roman Palestine during Jesus’s life, the right to execute by
crucifixion was Rome’s alone. In capital cases, Rome often worked
with local aristocrats who shared its interests (I discuss this power
pyramid in Chapter 13). During Jesus’s life, the local Roman repre-
sentative was the prefect Pontius Pilate, and the local leaders who
collaborated with him were a small group of leading Jews.
Provoking the people: Pontius Pilate
Pontius Pilate served as prefect for ten solid years (26–36 CE),
which is one of the two lengthiest tenures of any Roman ruler in
Judea. A long run like Pilate’s indicates successful control of the
province. After all, the emperor would quickly yank anyone who
couldn’t keep the province quiet and the taxes flowing.
Although the gospels portray the Jewish leaders as the aggressors
in Jesus’s arrest and death, historically it was Pilate who had a
© CORBIS

reputation for provoking the Jews. The Jewish philosopher Philo,
painting Pilate in the worst possible light, reports secondhand that
Pilate had an “inflexible, stubborn, and cruel disposition” and was
known for “venality, thefts, assaults, abusive behavior, and his fre-
quent murders of untried prisoners” (Legacy to Gaius 38.302; Luke
13:1–2 also recalls these murders).
But Pilate’s worst offense was the mass murder of unarmed pilgrims
who gathered in Samaria a few years after Jesus’s death. The
Samaritans complained to the Syrian legate, and Pilate was pulled
back to Rome for good (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 18.4.1–2).
Despite what other sources say, the gospels portray Pilate as a rather
limp leader who was swayed by the Jewish crowds and manipulated
by the Jewish aristocracy. This portrayal may be partly due to the
gospel authors’ desire to blame the Jewish leaders for Jesus’s death
(see the later section, “Understanding the Roman trial,” for details).
But it’s probably also the gospel authors’ way of showing the impo-
tence of Rome against the kingdom of God. Either way you look at it,
both motives compromise the historicity of the portrait.
Collaborating with Rome: 
The Jewish leaders
Even though he liked to throw his weight around and show who
was boss, Pontius Pilate’s long tenure depended on an effective
working relationship with the high priest and the handful of other
high-ranking priests and aristocrats he relied on for tax farming
and local governance. The High Priest Joseph Caiaphas, for instance,
who had taken office in 18 CE, remained in that position when
Pilate arrived in 26 CE and wasn’t deposed until Pilate was in 36
CE. So, they worked as a team, and they operated quite effectively
in that partnership during the period of Jesus’s ministry.
Caiaphas may have been Pilate’s buddy, but that doesn’t mean that
their interests were identical. In fact, whenever Pilate did something
provocative, Caiaphas would have to troubleshoot the situation.
Like Pilate, Caiaphas wanted to stay in power and keep the peace,
but unlike Pilate, he also had to protect Jewish people and represent
their religious sensibilities to the pagan prefect.
John’s gospel, which doesn’t normally cut the Judean Jews any
slack, surprisingly presents a fairly nuanced portrait of the high
priest’s motives for arresting Jesus (see the later section, “Judas:
Giving Jesus the kiss-off,” for more about Jesus’s betrayal and
arrest). John’s gospel says that when Jesus’s following grows to
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection
216

dangerous proportions, Caiaphas tells the Jewish aristocracy, “It’s
better for you that one man should die for the people, so that the
whole nation isn’t lost” (John 11:50).
The Entrance of Jesus
into Jerusalem
The four gospels record that Jesus went to Jerusalem for the
Passover festival. They give no precise date for this event, but
scholars speculate that it would have been between 29 and 31 CE.
The roads to Jerusalem were filled with pilgrims, some of whom
had no doubt heard about Jesus. In the following sections, I explain
the expectations about Jesus when he entered Jerusalem, and I dis-
cuss possible causes of his eventual arrest.
Riding in on high expectations
As Jesus entered Jerusalem, expectations ran high. Passover was,
after all, the festival of liberation, celebrating God’s act of freeing
the Israelites from the Egyptian Pharaoh. Folks wondered whether
this could be the moment that God had chosen to inaugurate a
new kingdom and overthrow Rome.
We have no way of knowing whether Jesus himself thought this
was the case. But because he had always spoken of a coming reign
(see Chapter 10 for details), it’s reasonable to assume that the crowds
expected the inauguration of the kingdom of God; it helps to explain
why the Jerusalem leadership and Pontius Pilate considered Jesus
a threat. And, given the way the gospels describe Jesus’s arrival,
it’s certainly true that the gospel authors believe that his entrance
into Jerusalem is his messianic moment. For example, consider
these descriptions of his arrival:
 Psalm 118:22–23 and 26–27 infuse the story of his arrival, setting
the stage for the Passion:
“The stone rejected by the builders has become the cor-
nerstone. By the Lord has this been done; it is wonderful
in our eyes . . . Blessed is he who comes in the name of
the Lord; we bless you from the house of the Lord. The
Lord is God, and he has given us light. Order the festival
procession with boughs up to the horns of the altar.”
In Mark’s gospel, Jesus quotes the first two verses himself in a
climactic scene that’s set in the temple soon after, when he
compares himself to the rejected cornerstone (Mark 12:1–12).
Chapter 14: Examining Jesus’s Crucifixion 217

 The crowd praises Jesus and calls him a “Son of (King) David”
or King himself (Mark 11:9–10; John 12:13).
 The fact that Jesus enters Jerusalem riding a colt alludes to a
prophecy from Zechariah 9:9 that says that Jerusalem’s “king”
will enter the city this way. In fact, Matthew and John cite the
prophecy explicitly (Matthew 21:4–5; John 12:14–16):
“Say to daughter Zion, Look, your king comes to you, meek
and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of an ass.”
(Matthew 21:5)
Matthew has Jesus arrive astride both a donkey and a colt at the
same time, fulfilling the prophecy literally (and uncomfortably).
Two sources usually treated as independent witnesses, Mark and
John, report this event, leading some scholars to wonder whether
they share some common source or tradition. But even if they are
independent witnesses, the passage is heavily layered with biblical
allusions that reflect post-resurrection Christian reflection on
Jesus’s life (John admits as much in 12:16 of his gospel).
Attracting attention from leaders
All four gospels try to explain how the week will end by offering a
sequence of worsening events in Jerusalem. They include a lot of
Jesus’s parables and teachings (you can read about these in
Chapter 11). The gospels differ from each other, however, on just
what triggers the arrest of Jesus, and scholars today continue to
debate why Jesus was so angry during one of the crucial events.
Looking at causes in the gospels for Jesus’s arrest
Jesus’s entry into Jerusalem to the acclaim of the crowds would
have been enough historically to trigger both Joseph Caiaphas’s
and Pontius Pilate’s attention. After all, they would have been wary
of all those pilgrims turning on them, so they wanted to eliminate
Jesus to quash the hope of the crowd.
But while the gospels acknowledge the crowd’s role in Jesus’s pop-
ularity, they don’t report Pilate’s concern. Their focus is entirely on
the Jewish leaders. They give different reports of what triggered
the Jewish leaders’ attention:
 In Mark’s gospel, Jesus enters the Jerusalem Temple the day
after arriving in Jerusalem, driving out the buyers and sellers
and overturning the tables of the money-changers and the
stools of the pigeon sellers. Then he says, “you have made
(my father’s house) a den of robbers” (Mark 11:15–17). This
fills the chief priests and scribes with so much rage that they
plot to destroy him (Mark 11:18–19).
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection
218

 In John’s gospel, the preceding Temple scene inaugurates
Jesus’s entire ministry, occurring on the first of several annual
trips to Jerusalem (John 2:13–17). So, the scene can’t be the cat-
alyst for Jesus’s arrest because it happens a few years before-
hand. Instead, the reason that the Jewish leaders plot Jesus’s
death is because he has raised Lazarus from the dead (see
Chapter 12), which was inspiring too many people to believe in
him and threatening to attract Rome’s wrath (John 11:45–53).
Explaining the Temple tantrum
Say for the sake of argument that you follow the synoptic gospels
of Matthew, Mark, and Luke and that you take the Temple scene as
a cause of Jesus’s arrest. Scholars have spent years debating what
exactly made Jesus so angry about the Temple. Here are some of
the questions they ask regarding Jesus’s Temple tantrum:
 Did he think that the Temple’s time had come — that it had
to be replaced? Christians would definitely start to say that
after the Temple was destroyed in 70 CE. But if that’s what the
historical Jesus meant, why did he and the early Christians
keep going there? (Mark 11:27; 12:35; Q 21:1–4; Mark 13:1–3;
Luke 21:37–38; Acts 2:46–4:4; 5:12–42; 21:15–22:22, and so on).
 Did he think that the Temple was fine in principle, but that
it had become corrupt and needed to be “cleansed”?
Despite the popularity of this argument, there’s no hint of this
concern in Jesus’s subsequent behavior and the prayer prac-
tices of his disciples. Once again, they keep going there to
pray, preach, teach, and heal (Mark 12:41–44; Acts 21:15–36).
 Did he expect some ideal replacement Temple like some
other Jews did, taking inspiration from Ezekiel’s vision of a
colossal building (Ezekiel 40:1–47:12)? This argument doesn’t
seem likely because there’s no hint of such a hope in the New
Testament. In fact, Revelation envisions a new Jerusalem that
has no Temple at all (Revelation 21:22).
The problem with all these explanations is that they presume Jesus
is attacking the whole Temple. But that argument doesn’t make
sense because Jesus claims to be restoring it from a den of robbers
to a house of prayer (Mark 11:17). John’s gospel makes it even
clearer by quoting a Jewish Psalm: Jesus is zealous for God’s
house; he’s not out to destroy it (John 2:17; see Psalm 69:10).
There’s a clue regarding the source of Jesus’s fury in the targets of
his attack: the money-changers and the pigeon sellers. Both of these
groups were necessary for the Temple’s proper function. The money-
changers converted — with a small surcharge — local and interna-
tional coins to the silver Tyrian tetradrachms that were required for
the annual Temple tax. The pigeon sellers were important because
Chapter 14: Examining Jesus’s Crucifixion 219

the pigeons were the cheapest animal offering, which meant that
the poor bought them rather than the more expensive animals
(Luke 2:24; Leviticus 12). The poor had a hard enough time surviving
without having to pay to participate in the sacrificial system. But
the law was that everyone had to pay.
So, it appears that Jesus was furious because he opposed making
the poor pay. He thought that they were the ones being robbed. In
support of this argument, elsewhere in the gospels, the gospel
authors characterize Jesus’s message as good news for the poor 
(Q 7:18–23) and show Jesus teaching people to trust that God will
care for them (Q 12:22–32). Jesus is shown to deserve trust when
he feeds a huge crowd of people, recalling how God fed the Israelites
during their 40 years in the wilderness (Exodus 16:1–35). This
contrasts the rule of Herod’s family and the Romans, who take
taxes (Mark 12:13–17; Matthew 17:24–27) but don’t provide for the
people (Mark 6:17–34; Matthew 2:1–18; 11:28–30; Luke 13:1–2).
If this is actually what the historical act symbolized, that means
that it didn’t symbolize the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple,
as Mark’s gospel and so many modern commentators think. It also
means that this act could have been viewed as politically disrup-
tive but was probably not the sole catalyst for Jesus’s arrest that
Mark’s gospel makes it out to be.
Suffering through the Passion
By the late 900s CE, the sufferings of Jesus around which the gospel
proclamation revolves came to be called the “Passion” in the Latin
West. The term comes from the Latin passio, or “suffering.” The
stories of the conspiracy against Jesus, his anointing at Bethany, his
Last Supper, the prayer in Gethsemane, and his arrest, trial, execu-
tion, and resurrection (see Chapter 15) are collectively called the
“Passion Narrative.” In the following sections, I walk you through
Jesus’s final days, from the predictions of his death to his final meal
with his followers, his arrest, his trials, and his crucifixion. I help
you examine what the gospels report and reconstruct what most
likely happened.
Predicting a bad end
Whatever the immediate cause of Jesus’s death, it’s quite likely
that he saw it coming. His message of a coming reign of God (see
Chapter 11), his charismatic power (see Chapter 12), and the cele-
bratory manner of his welcome to Jerusalem (which I cover earlier
in this chapter) set him against Rome and the Judean aristocracy.
It doesn’t take a prophet to see how the story might end.
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection
220

Prophesying the Passion
The gospel narratives begin alluding to Jesus’s death quite early on
(Mark 3:6; Matthew 1–2), and they show Jesus predicting it while
still in the north (Mark 8:31–33; 9:30–32; 10:32–34). In addition, all
the gospels organize their plots around Jesus’s death, giving an
even greater impression of Jesus’s foreknowledge and intent. For
example, consider these telling events:
 The synoptic gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke depict Jesus
resolutely turning from the Galilee to Jerusalem (Mark 10:1 ||
Matthew 19:1–2 || Luke 9:51). According to these gospels,
Jesus knows that he’ll be killed in that city (Mark 8:31–33 ||
Matthew 16:21–27 || Luke 9:22–26), and so his decision to go
there represents his willingness to endure that fate.
 In John’s gospel, Jesus goes to Jerusalem more often, but the
whole gospel is organized around the “hour” when Jesus
would be “glorified,” which is John’s phrase for the death and
resurrection (John 2:4; 12:20–33; 17:1).
For earlier disciples who viewed Jesus as a prophet, death in
Jerusalem was par for the course — it’s where many of the
prophets had died (Q 13:34–35; Mark 12:1–12; Luke 13:33–34). But
if, like the gospel authors, you believe that Jesus is the messiah,
you have a lot of explaining to do. Why? Well, every prediction
about the messiah was that he’d be accepted by the Jewish people
and would successfully usher in a new age (Mark 8:31–33; Luke
24:13–35). Given Jesus’s execution, he didn’t quite fit that bill.
When you see the gospel authors supplying these elaborate expla-
nations and motives that help to explain later events, you’re no
longer standing on historical ground. Instead, you’re on the ground
of faith. The authors explain the unpredicted end by asserting that
it was foretold in scripture (see the later section “Seeking Solace in
Scripture”), it was Jesus’s intent, and it was part of a divine plan of
redemption. All of these are faith claims, however, not historical
claims. Just because they’re faith claims doesn’t mean that they’re
untrue, however; it simply means that, if they are true, they’re true
in another way. They can’t be proven to everyone’s satisfaction on
the basis of the historical evidence — which is the kind of histori-
cal “truth” that historians aim for. Instead, they are interpretations
of the evidence that communities judge to be valid because the
story makes sense of the world in light of their experience.
Foreseeing the fall of Jerusalem
Several passages in the gospels say that Jesus predicted the
destruction of the Temple (Mark 13:1–2; 14:58–59; John 2:19–22).
Such a prediction may have been part of his vision of God’s coming
reign — a kind of “out with the old, in with the new” message that
Chapter 14: Examining Jesus’s Crucifixion 221

we find in other Jewish end-time literature from the same period.
Another criterion in favor of the episode is that it seems to have
been a somewhat embarrassing tradition because John’s gospel
reinterprets it so that Jesus is speaking instead of the temple of his
body. And Luke moves this prediction from Jesus’s trial to the trial
of the early Christian deacon Stephen (Acts 6:12–13; compare Luke
22:66–71 with his source Mark 14:55–64).
But it’s also possible that the prediction appears in so many different
forms and places because Jesus never actually said it, or he said
something much more modest. After the actual destruction of
Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 CE, the gospel authors most likely
embellished the predictions with details from the actual war (see
the detailed descriptions of the war in Mark 13:14–20; Luke 19:41–44;
21:24; 23:27–31). And Jesus’s death was likely reinterpreted in terms
of the Temple’s loss (note how the Temple curtain tears at the
moment of Jesus’s death in Mark 15:37–38). The inconsistency of the
gospel sources and the concern of the later gospel authors to con-
nect Jerusalem’s fate with Jesus’s make the historicity of these pre-
dictions questionable, especially the notion that the historical Jesus
himself connected his death to the “death” of the city.
Anointing Jesus for burial before his death
Both Mark and John independently report that a woman poured
expensive ointment on Jesus in the village of Bethany near
Jerusalem, just before his death (Mark 14:3–9; John 12:1–8). In these
two gospels, this act is presented as a kind of anointing (don’t
forget that messiah or Christ means “anointed one”) and as an
advance embalming because Jesus will have to be buried so hastily.
Luke, on the other hand, tells the story much earlier in his gospel
and changes the details so that the act is no longer about Jesus’s
anointing or death at all (Luke 7:36–50). Something like this anoint-
ing probably happened, but the interpretation of it in light of
Jesus’s death may be a later addition.
Celebrating a final meal
Jesus shared one final meal with the Twelve on the night he was
betrayed and arrested (see Chapter 10 for more on this group of
disciples). Trouble is, you have two very different versions of the
event: The first appears in the apostle Paul’s first letter to the
Corinthians and in the synoptic gospels, and the second version
occurs in John’s gospel. Multiple attestation and chronological pri-
ority favor Paul and the synoptics, so that’s where I start.
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection
222

The body and blood of Jesus: Paul andthe synoptics’ view of
the meal
Table 14-1 shows a synopsis of the Last Supper (check out Chapter
3 to read more about the usefulness of a synopsis). If you look
closely, you really have two traditions here rather than four: Luke
follows Paul and Mark, and Matthew follows Mark. The two early
and independent sources, Paul and Mark, agree that
 This meal occurred on the night Jesus was betrayed (it isn’t
clear in Paul that it was the first night of Passover).
 Jesus took bread, broke it, and distributed it, calling it his body.
 After breaking bread, he then took a cup, which he called
either a “new covenant” (evoking Jeremiah 31:31–34) or the
“covenant in my blood” (evoking Exodus 24:8).
 The body and/or blood are given for others.
A meal certainly happened, but some scholars won’t venture to say
much beyond that. They think that references to the bread as body
and the wine as blood must be later reflections on the significance
of Jesus’s death. Also late, in their view, are the biblical allusions
and notions about the purpose of Jesus’s death (like Matthew’s for-
giveness of sins). Others, however, think that it’s possible that
Jesus knew his death was coming and so tied this final meal to it,
commanding his disciples to remember him this way.
Focusing on service, not food: John’s view of the meal
John’s gospel tells a somewhat different story than Paul or the syn-
optic gospels do of that last meal. Here are the two main differences
in John’s version of the supper:
 It isn’t the Passover dinner eaten on the first night of the
festival. In John’s gospel the Passover begins the following
day (John 13:1; 18:28; 19:31). See the nearby sidebar, “The
symbolism behind the dates of the Last Supper,” for details.
 You never hear what they eat. Instead of breaking bread and
sharing wine, Jesus takes off his outer garment and goes
around the room washing the disciples’ feet. It’s a smelly, dis-
gusting job that was done only by servants. So, the fact that
Jesus does this for his followers sets the bar pretty high for
them. Following Jesus isn’t about dominating people, but
about serving, as his death the next day makes clear.

Praying on the Mount of Olives
After the Last Supper, Jesus and the disciples sang a hymn, and
then went out to the Mount of Olives, which was just a stone’s
throw from the eastern wall of the Temple Mount (see Figure 14-2).
The Mount of Olives was famous for its olive trees (“Gethsemane,”
the place on the Mount of Olives where Jesus goes to pray, literally
means “oil press”). But the mount was also known as the place
where God would stand to battle the nations (Zechariah 14:3–4).
This prophecy wasn’t about the messiah; it was about God’s final
battle with all the nations. But early Christians probably had
Zechariah’s prophecy in mind when they painted this as the place
where Jesus would begin the battle of his life (see Mark 11:1; 13:3).
After Jesus and his disciples arrive in Gethsemane (John 18:1 just
calls it “a garden”), the synoptic gospels report that Jesus steps
away from his disciples to pray alone (Mark 14:32–42 || Matthew
26:36–46; Luke 22:39–46). During this time, the disciples can’t
manage to stay awake. Luke says they fell asleep “for sorrow”
(Luke 22:45). Nice excuse, huh?
Chapter 14: Examining Jesus’s Crucifixion 225
The symbolism behind the dates 
of the Last Supper
Did Jesus’s last meal with his disciples take place on the first night of the Passover
festival, as the synoptic gospels say, or on the night before the festival, as John says?
No matter what date you choose, both options are highly symbolic. For example:
 The synoptic supper takes on all the symbolism of the Passover meal, when
Jews recalled their liberation from slavery and ate the food that their ances-
tors ate in Egypt (Exodus 12). The foods included the lamb slaughtered in the
Temple, which recalls the lamb whose blood on Israelite doorposts spared their
firstborn sons from the angel of death in the final Egyptian plague. The unleav-
ened bread symbolized their haste to leave Egypt. The Passover meal in the syn-
optic gospels carries all those biblical resonances into a new ritual
memorializing Jesus’s saving death.
 John loses the opportunity for all that symbolism, but he gains it back in another
way. For instance, if Jesus eats the meal the night before the festival, he dies
on the first day of the festival, and that’s when the priests are slaughtering the
Passover lambs in the Temple. In the symbolism of John’s gospel, Jesus
becomes the “Lamb of God,” whose death saves those who believe in him (see
John 1:29, 36 and Revelation 5–7; 17:14).
Either way, it’s a safe bet that Jesus dies around the time of Passover, when large,
hopeful crowds massed in Jerusalem and the leaders were on edge.

Figure 14-2: Jerusalem during the time of Jesus.
With all the eyewitnesses asleep, no one could have recorded
Jesus’s prayer. It’s another case of the gospel authors giving you
the significance of the moment rather than the historical facts.
They’re attempting to characterize Jesus’s final temptation in his
final moment of freedom. Here’s how the story goes: Knowing that
he’ll likely be killed, Jesus struggles between his love of life and his
sense that his mission has led him to this end. He prays, asking
that this “cup” of suffering pass him by, but then he finally agrees
to endure the suffering if it’s his father’s will.
Later Christians had trouble with Jesus’s prayer. After all, if Jesus
was God — as they believed — how could his will and God’s will be
two different things? John finds a way around this dilemma. In his
gospel, Jesus doesn’t pray in the garden — he just gets arrested.
And when his soul is troubled in John 12:27, Jesus doesn’t pray for
escape because he knows that his death is his purpose on earth.

Judas: Giving Jesus the kiss-off
As Jesus prays in Gethsemane (or the garden in John’s story), his
disciple Judas draws near with a crowd of armed men. Judas can
identify Jesus to the armed guard, and he does so by the ironic ges-
ture of friendship, a kiss. The fact that one of Jesus’s closest follow-
ers betrayed him is attested by multiple sources (Paul in 1
Corinthians 11:23; Mark 3:19; John 12:4) and is certainly embarrass-
ing. Both of these facts argue for its historicity (check out Chapter
3 for more on these rules of historicity). Why Judas betrayed Jesus
is another question. (And the gospel explanation that Satan
entered him isn’t particularly helpful for historians.)
In the following sections, I trace the series of events that start with
Judas’s betrayal and end with the abandonment of Jesus by the
other members of the Twelve.
Betraying loyalties
In Mark’s gospel, Judas seeks out the chief priests to negotiate a
bounty on Jesus’s head. As usual, Matthew and Luke follow Mark’s
version. Paul just says that Jesus was handed over, and John iden-
tifies Judas as the betrayer but doesn’t offer any scene of Judas
negotiating with the Jewish leaders.
So why does Judas do this? Is he disappointed that Jesus will die
rather than usher in God’s reign? Is he trying to hasten a confronta-
tion with the leaders? It’s difficult to tell. The moment he takes
those 30 pieces of silver as his reward for betraying Jesus, his
greed becomes a new conversational thread in the gospel tradition
(see John 12:4–6; 13:29).
Only Matthew offers a sympathetic portrait of Judas. In Matthew’s
gospel, Judas regrets his role after the chief priests and elders con-
vict Jesus. He throws his reward money at them and then hangs
himself. Later traditions would be less sympathetic; they imagined
in increasingly gruesome detail exactly how he died (see Table 14-2
for three versions of the tale; Matthew and Luke’s date to the first
century, and the story told by the second century Christian leader
Papias embellishes).

The death of Judas has become an important tradition, especially in
art. Figure 14-3 depicts a carving at the Autun Cathedral in France in
which Judas, flanked by demons, commits suicide. It’s important to
recognize that in later Christian art, Judas comes to represent the
Jewish people. His presumed monetary motives, the assumption
that he’s in league with Satan, and even his physical features shape
and are shaped by stereotypes of the Jewish people (see Chapter 16
for more on the dark side of Christian piety). These later inter-
preters conveniently forget Matthew’s tale of Judas’s regret, and that
Jesus’s other disciples, and of course Jesus himself, were Jews, too.
Arresting developments
Judas knew Jesus liked to go to Gethsemane, and so he picked an
opportune time when a crowd wouldn’t be around to lead the
authorities there for his arrest.
The crowd that accompanies Judas was most likely composed of the
Temple police force (John 18:3), variously described by the gospel
authors as “a crowd . . . from the chief priests, scribes, and elders”
(Mark 14:43) or “some officers from the chief priests and the
Pharisees” (John 18:3). John adds that a band of (Roman) soldiers
came along, too. John’s reference to “officers from the Pharisees”
isn’t likely because the Pharisees as a group weren’t in power, didn’t
have “officers,” and didn’t generally get along with the ruling priests
in the Sadduceean party (see Chapter 13 for details).
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection
228

Figure 14-3: A sculpture of the death of Judas.
The report that the police came out to arrest Jesus “as against a
robber, with swords and clubs” (Mark 14:48), has a ring of authen-
ticity to it, given that Jesus will be crucified as if he were a thief
(crucifixion was reserved for bandits, murderers, and rebels, like
the two other men Jesus is crucified between and the man Pilate
releases instead, Barabbas). The authorities must have viewed
Jesus as that sort of man in order to merit that sort of death.
The gospels, however, try to make it quite clear that Jesus wasn’t
that kind of threat, later in the Barabbas scene but even here in
Jesus’s pointed remarks to the arresting party (Mark 14:48–49), in his
rebuke of his sword-wielding follower (Matthew 26:52–56; Luke 22:51;
John 18:11), and in his restoration of an amputated ear (Luke 22:51).
These added details indicate not history but apologetics — the
defense of the tradition of a nonviolent Jesus. That tradition has a
pretty strong claim to authenticity, even if some of these details have
been added. It’s a question of the most plausible scenario. We know
that Jesus wasn’t arrested earlier and that his followers weren’t cru-
cified alongside him. Both of these facts indicate that his movement
wasn’t viewed as violent. The authorities weren’t out to quash an
actual rebellion here, but to nip one in the bud before the crowd of
pilgrims got out of control (see Chapter 13).

Scattering disciples
The gospels report the embarrassing fact that all of Jesus’s male
disciples scattered from Gethsemane and abandoned Jesus to his
fate (and don’t forget that because it’s embarrassing, it’s more
likely to be true; see Chapter 3 for details). Peter is an exception: In
two independent witnesses, he at least follows Jesus to the house
of the high priest, but then he promptly denies knowing him (Mark
14:53–65; John 18:13–24). John’s gospel offers another exception: A
follower identified only as “the beloved disciple,” who gets Peter in
to the high priest’s courtyard, follows Jesus to the cross, takes
Jesus’s place as Mary’s son, and is the first to “believe” when he
sees Jesus’s empty tomb (John 18:15–16; 19:25–27; 20:1–10).
Putting Jesus on trial
The four gospels offer much more detail on Jesus’s various trials
than they do on his actual scourging and execution. And yet the
historian must ask what the sources would be for this trial material.
After all, the gospel authors have just reported that all the disciples
have fled, and the one or two who follow Jesus to the Jewish trial are
stuck out in the courtyard. It’s possible that some people present at
the Jewish trial at least provided testimony to Christians later, such
as Joseph of Arimathea (described as a member of the “ruling
council” in Mark 15:43) or the Pharisee Nicodemus (described as a
“ruler of the Jews” in John 3:1). But no gospel reports their presence
at the trial or their testimony later; there’s no explicit chain 
of tradition here.
In this sense, the trial scenes are like the scene of Jesus’s garden
prayer (which I cover earlier in this chapter). In other words, the
gospels aren’t providing historical, eyewitness accounts. Instead,
they’re portraying the significance of what’s at stake for them
through scenes that have been percolating in the Christian imagi-
nation for decades.
Trumping up charges at the Jewish trial
The Jewish leaders and high priest, in their administrative body
called the Sanhedrin (Greek for “sitting together” or “assembly”),
most likely played an important role in Jesus’s arrest and death.
Their place at the top of the power pyramid meant that their goals
were often similar to Rome’s: Keep unrest at a minimum and pre-
serve the beneficial status quo (see Chapter 13 for more about the
power pyramid). The Jewish leaders would have understood how
Jesus’s words and actions could lead a crowd to messianic agita-
tion, and they would have had an easier time locating Jesus than
the Romans would have. So, it’s quite likely that they arrested
Jesus and turned him over to Rome.
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection
230

The gospels, of course, give the Jewish leaders a much bigger role
in Jesus’s arrest and death. However, the narratives are riddled
with historically unlikely details, including the following:
 In Mark, which is the earliest account, the council of the chief
priests, elders, and scribes (the Sanhedrin) hold two full
meetings — one the night Jesus is arrested and another the
next morning (Mark 14:53–65; 15:1). Two meetings of the
whole group are unlikely, particularly on the first night of
Passover (ask any pastor how he or she feels on Easter night
after Holy Week and you’ll get the idea). Matthew keeps
Mark’s two Jewish trials (Matthew 26:57–68, 27:1). John’s
gospel, on the other hand, presents the Sanhedrin meeting
well before Passover, a more likely scenario (John 11:45–53).
 In Mark and Matthew’s gospels, the leaders of the Sanhedrin
seek out testimony against Jesus, and multiple witnesses offer
false and contradictory testimony (Mark 14:55–59 || Matthew
26:59–63). This isn’t mentioned in Luke’s and John’s accounts,
raising the possibility that Mark and Matthew are adding gra-
tuitous details to paint the Sanhedrin’s actions in the worst
possible light.
 Only Mark’s and Matthew’s gospels report that the Sanhedrin
delivers a formal capital sentence against Jesus (Mark 14:64 ||
Matthew 26:66); neither Luke nor John say this. Once again, it
looks like Mark and Matthew are adding extra details to make
the Sanhedrin look as bad as possible.
 The gospels claim that Jesus received a blasphemy conviction
for words that aren’t clearly blasphemous (blasphemy is a
Greek word for taunting or insulting a person or God). Here
are some of the rebuffs:
• The claim to be “messiah” didn’t insult God; on the con-
trary, God had promised one (a king in 2 Samuel 7:11–16;
Psalm 18:51; 132:17; a high priest in Leviticus 4:3–5; a
coming figure in Daniel 9:25).
• The claim to be “the son of the Blessed One” was a tradi-
tional term (for David, for example, in 2 Samuel 7:14, and
for Israel in Exodus 4:22 and Hosea 11). Even assuming
that the high priest meant by “son of God” what later
Christians would mean, where in Mark’s gospel does
Jesus ever claim that identity publicly? Mark seems to
think the Temple tantrum implies it (I discuss this scene
earlier in this chapter), but that’s far from clear.
• Quoting scripture was certainly not blasphemous. In
Mark 14:61–64, Jesus cites Daniel 7:13: “You will see the
son of man seated at the right hand of power . . .”).
Chapter 14: Examining Jesus’s Crucifixion 231

The terms “messiah,” “son of God,” and “son of man” from the pre-
ceding list become titles for Jesus after the resurrection and come
to bear meanings that they don’t carry in Jewish scripture, such as
meanings tied to Jesus’s unique role as God’s son and thus as
divine himself (see Chapter 15). Most historians think that these
later Christological beliefs (theological views of what it meant to be
Christ or messiah) weren’t at stake during his actual life. But by
the time the gospels are written, these beliefs are at stake, and so
the gospel writers focus the Jewish trial around the matter of
Jesus’s identity. Had Jesus actually claimed divine power equal to
God’s, he might have been guilty of blasphemy, at least as the
Sadducees likely defined it (they were pretty strict about such
things compared to the Pharisees; see Chapter 7).
In addition to historically unlikely details in the gospels, Jesus’s
Pharisaical foes and their concerns about Sabbath, purity, and fast-
ing are nowhere to be found. That’s at least odd, given that they’ve
been Jesus’s chief adversaries everywhere else in the story.
Luke, who tries to present an “accurately investigated” and “more
orderly account” of Jesus’s story (Luke 1:3), has only one interroga-
tion in the morning, no trial before the high priest, no false witnesses,
and no charge of blasphemy (Luke 22:54, 63–71). The issues at stake
aren’t temple predictions or blasphemy, but political agitation and
failure to pay Roman taxes (Luke 23:2). Luke’s gospel seems to further
emphasize the political nature of Jesus’s “threat” by including a trial
before Herod Antipas (Luke 23:6–12), although this produces the
same verdict of innocence that Pilate is leaning toward. (This scene
is also reported in the Gospel of Peter, although Herod condemns
Jesus there.) John’s gospel reduces this entire Jewish “trial” to a con-
versation between Joseph Caiaphas’s father-in-law, Annas, and Jesus
(his Sanhedrin trial is in John 11:45–53). For Luke and John, the chief
concerns are political; for Mark and Matthew, they’re religious.
Understanding the Roman trial
In their provinces, Rome allowed its representatives the “power of
the sword” in the cases of threats to the peace. In other words,
they could use capital punishment if they deemed it necessary.
The Jewish leaders in Jerusalem and the Galilee could execute
people for certain religious offenses. As you find out in Chapter 10,
for example, Herod Antipas beheaded John the Baptist (Mark
6:21–29) for his alleged offenses.
Only Rome could convict and execute rebels and robbers, which
places the historical blame for Jesus’s death squarely on its shoul-
ders. There were supposed to be trials of the accused, but Pontius
Pilate had a reputation for summary judgment (Philo, for example,
has a reference to Pilate’s “frequent murders of untried prisoners”
in Legacy to Gaius 38.302).
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection
232

If the Jewish leaders denounced and handed over Jesus as a political
threat, he could have been crucified for one of two crimes:
 Being a major public enemy
 Being a detriment to the reputation of the Roman people and
those holding its mandate
It’s usually assumed that the last charge was the one Pilate used in
Jesus’s case (if he actually followed the law). And it wouldn’t have
been necessary for Jesus to call himself the “messiah” in order for
this charge to stick; the hope of the crowd would have been
enough to worry Rome.
In Mark’s early gospel (written somewhere between 65 and 75 CE),
Pilate realizes or declares Jesus’s innocence three times; Matthew
and Luke about a decade later have five or six such statements; and
the latest gospel, John, claims it seven times (see Table 14-3 for a
synopsis). If the Romans supposedly killed Jesus, why do these
gospels present Pilate as an increasingly unwilling participant in
Jesus’s execution?
There are at least two contributing reasons for letting Pilate off the
hook in the gospels:
 The Jewish people as a whole didn’t accept that Jesus was the
messiah. So, as the split with the Jews grew, Christians blamed
the Jews more and more for Jesus’s death, especially after the
Roman destruction of the Jewish Temple. At that point, as
Jews and Christians wondered why God had allowed that to
happen, one Christian answer was that the Jews had brought it
on themselves for rejecting and killing God’s messiah.
 As the Christian Church became increasingly non-Jewish and
fell under increasing scrutiny by Rome, the Church found it
natural and beneficial to present the Roman prefect as a sym-
pathetic figure.
This tendency to exonerate and even Christianize Pilate (and his
wife) continues in later Christian literature. It’s not historically
plausible, given what we know about Pilate, unless perhaps he
pretended to think that Jesus was innocent in order to win points
with the pro-Jesus crowd. He wasn’t normally known for that kind
of sensitivity, but it could have been a calculated move to make
him appear more tolerant than the Jewish elite. That way, the
crowd’s anger over Jesus’s death would have been deflected off
Rome and onto the Jewish leaders.
The flip side of exonerating Pontius Pilate is that the gospels blame
the Jews for Jesus’s death. The gospels consistently present the

Jewish leaders as the aggressors. The leaders bring the accusation.
They whip up the crowd to demand Jesus’s crucifixion.
In Matthew and John’s gospels, it’s no longer just the leaders who
are guilty, but the entire people. For example, in Matthew’s gospel,
when Pilate dramatically washes his hands, symbolizing that
Jesus’s blood is not on him (only this gospel and the gospel of
Peter report this), “all the people” cry out, “His blood be on us and
on our children!” (Matthew 27:25). Matthew, writing after
Jerusalem’s destruction, probably wrote that line to advance his
view that the generation after Jesus paid the price for Jesus’s
death. But his move to blame all the Jews for that calamity has
proven to be a greater calamity for Jews: Christians have used this
line to legitimize untold violence against all generations of Jews
ever since.
The Jewish crowds were responsible for Jesus’s death, but not in
the way that the gospels portray. They supported Jesus. They must
have, or this particular death sentence wouldn’t make any sense.
Crucifixion was a public death that was meant to send a message
to sympathizers. If Jesus didn’t have sympathizers, Rome wouldn’t
have killed him in this way (see Chapter 13).
Crucifying the king
The gospel accounts of Jesus’s crucifixion are terse. He was
scourged (probably just with a stiff reed), humiliated as a mock
king with a crown of thorns and purple robe, loaded up with the
crossbeam, and then led out to a place called Golgotha (or
“Calvary” from the Latin Calvaria). There he was stripped and cru-
cified between two bandits, with a titulus (a placard posting his
crime) above his head that read “The King of the Jews.” None of
the gospels say that Jesus was nailed to the cross, although it was
customary to nail at least the ankles, as the unearthed remains of
one crucified man from this period demonstrate. However, the res-
urrection narratives in the gospels do suggest that Jesus had been
nailed through his hands and feet (see the later sidebar “The five
wounds and the stigmata”).
The gospels make a point to say that some Christian disciples wit-
nessed the crucifixion. But because the men had scattered, only
female followers like Mary Magdalene remained (see Chapter 10 for
more on the women; John 19:26–27 adds the male “beloved disciple”
to the scene).
Jesus died within several hours, which was more quickly than
most victims (Mark 15:25–37; John 19:33). Most of the crucified
were left on the cross for the vultures or dumped in mass graves,
and one biblical tradition indicates that Jesus was buried by his
Chapter 14: Examining Jesus’s Crucifixion 235

enemies (Acts 13:27–29). Two other independent sources — the
gospels of Mark and John — state that one of Jesus’s disciples,
Joseph of Arimathea, received permission to bury the body hastily
in a tomb (Mark 15:42–47; John 19:38–42).
Seeking Solace in Scripture
Jesus’s arrest and execution were profoundly traumatic for the
early Christians, and these events remained difficult to explain
even after the “victory” of the resurrection (see Chapter 15). As the
Christians pondered the meaning of this horrific set of events, they
sought comfort and insight in scripture. They believed that Jesus’s
death was part of a divine plan, and so they reasoned that the plan
could be found in God’s prior revelation (Matthew 26:24, 54, 56;
Luke 24:25–27, 32, 44–46; Acts 13:29, 32; 1 Corinthians 15:4).
By the time the gospel accounts of Jesus’s death were written, the
early Christian teachers, preachers, and prophets had found sev-
eral scriptural solutions to the most troubling aspects of Jesus’s
arrest and death. These solutions were then woven into the gospel
Passion Narratives to reflect the later Church’s faith. Christians
found in Jewish scriptures the details for scenes that no Christian
disciples could have witnessed (for example, the trials). The early
Christians found four major patterns in Jewish scripture that pre-
saged what would happen to Jesus. Here are those patterns (see
Table 14-4 for specific citations and allusions):
 God’s prophets and God’s wisdom were often rejected, just as
Jesus was rejected by the Jewish people (Q 13:34–35; Amos
7:10–13; Jeremiah 20:10; 26:1–24; Proverbs 1:20–33; 8:22–36).
This allowed Christians to console themselves that Jesus’s
rejection by God’s people didn’t mean that he was out of sync
with God. On the contrary, it means that he fit a pattern
described in God’s revelation.
 A righteous, innocent man would suffer (1 Peter 2:22–25;
Isaiah 53:4–12; Job). The early Christians believed that Jesus
was innocent but had to account for why God would let one
who was righteous and innocent suffer so much and fail.
Christians found consolation in biblical texts that praised
those who suffer without cause.
 Suffering would precede restoration, which is a pattern visible
in the Exodus, the return from exile, and the painful apocalyptic
birth of the new age (Mark 13:3–37; Hosea 6:1–2). The messiah
was supposed to usher in a new age of justice and peace, but
Jesus didn’t. Christians found in the scriptural narratives
repeated occasions when restoration was deferred, allowing
them to await the completion of Jesus’s messianic work.
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection
236

 The suffering and death of God’s servant would redeem or
save the people (see 1 Corinthians 15:3; Isaiah 53:4–12). This
passage in Isaiah allowed Christians to imagine that there was
a purpose in Jesus’s suffering.

Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection
238
The five wounds and the stigmata
Christian tradition holds that Jesus was nailed through his hands or wrists and his
ankles and was pierced in his side, yielding five wounds. This tradition is based on
John’s crucifixion scene and the resurrection appearances in Luke’s and John’s
gospels. In Luke, for example, the risen Jesus shows his disciples “his hands and
his feet” as proof of his identity, presumably because these would bear the char-
acteristic wounds of crucifixion (Luke 24:36–43). In John’s gospel, Jesus’s side is
pierced while he’s still hanging on the cross (John 19:34–37). Also, when Jesus rises
and appears to doubting Thomas, he invites Thomas to probe the holes in his hands
and side (John 20:24–29).
Later Christians so identified with the suffering of Christ that they claimed to bear
the marks (which in the Greek plural are called stigmata) on their bodies as well. A
stigma is a tattoo or brand that slaves would get to mark them as someone’s prop-
erty. The apostle Paul is the first to say that he bears the stigmata of Christ. He’s
probably referring to his scars from flogging or stoning during his frequent arrests
(Galatians 6:17; 2 Corinthians 11:22–31), not to replicas of Jesus’s actual wounds.
Still later, Francis of Assisi, Catherine of Siena, John of God, Padre Pio, and others
would claim the actual wounds of Christ or physical pains in their hands, feet, side,
forehead (recalling the crown of thorns), back (recalling his flogging), or shoulder
(recalling the carrying of the cross). Some reported sweating blood (based on
Jesus’s agony in the garden).

M
ost people’s biographies end with their deaths. Had Jesus of
Nazareth’s story ended this way, his relatives and friends
may have remembered him for a couple of generations as a great
teacher and miracle worker who died a noble death. No gospels
would have been written, no Christian religion would have devel-
oped, and world history would probably look a whole lot different.
In Jesus’s case, an event after his death so stunned his frightened
followers that they emerged from hiding to spread the word that he
had risen from the dead and was alive in a new way. They couldn’t
describe clearly what they had experienced, and their stories didn’t
completely match up. However, they traveled far and wide — and
many of them later died — to share this good news with the world.
In this chapter, you explore the reports of Jesus’s resurrection and
trace its impact on the followers he left behind. You also discover
the low and high Christologies that the New Testament authors
developed, follow these Christologies as Greco-Roman philosophy
transformed them, and enter the Christian debates over just who
this Christ was.
The Resurrection: Raising
Problems for Historians
The story of Jesus’s resurrection is the core of Christian faith, but
it poses problems for historians. For instance:

Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection 
240
 The resurrection itself is never narrated. But, I don’t expect
that it would help if it was recorded. After all, historians are
pretty skeptical of miracles (see Chapter 12).
 When stories are told of an empty tomb or resurrection
appearances, they all differ from each other and reflect experi-
ences of the transcendent that are difficult to understand and
impossible to test.
 The early Christians readily admit that the only witnesses are
those who already believed in Jesus (Acts 10:41). The exceptions
are Paul and possibly Jesus’s brother James (see 1 Corinthians
15:7–8 and John 7:5).
 Early Christians also make no bones about the fact that
Christian belief depends on an incredible story and their
ineloquent testimony (1 Corinthians 1:18–25; 15; John 20:29).
Yet here’s the conundrum for historians: There’s no feature of the
Jesus story that satisfies so many of the criteria of historicity
(which I cover in Chapter 3). Consider the following:
 It’s traced to many eyewitnesses. Paul, for example, claims
more than 515 eyewitnesses (1 Corinthians 15:3–8).
 It’s embarrassing (consider the divergent stories and women
as witnesses, for example).
 It’s an early tradition on which all the other traditions in the
gospels are predicated (no one would have bothered to write
gospels if the resurrection hadn’t occurred).
 It’s reported in multiple, independent sources (Paul, Mark,
John, and possibly Q 11:29–30, 32).
 It’s discontinuous with Jewish beliefs about resurrection
because, as far as we know, no one had ever claimed that
someone had actually risen, that this proved the person’s
unique status, and that this resurrection had something to
offer everyone (namely, that if they believed in it, they too
would rise). Early Christians had to pour tremendous energy
into understanding it themselves.
 It’s coherent not so much with the historical details of Jesus’s
life, but with the rise of early Christianity.
Because the story satisfies so many of the criteria of historicity, it
seems that something must have happened. But what exactly hap-
pened, and what it meant or means, can’t be pinned down so
easily. All that a historian can do is explore the changing shape of
Christian beliefs in the various communities that believed in the
risen Jesus, which is what you discover in the rest of this chapter.

Telling the Stories of 
Jesus’s Resurrection
Stories of Jesus’s resurrection found their way into the letters of
the apostle Paul in the mid-first century CE and into the gospel
accounts 20 to 40 years later. In these early sources, the authors
report that Jesus rose “on the third day” and that he appeared to
various people. To this narrative tradition, Paul adds his teaching
about the significance of this event for Christian believers. This
message is the core of early Christian preaching because the resur-
rection is the core of Christian faith.
Paul’s letters: Reporting 
the resurrection first
The earliest reports of the resurrection come from Paul’s letters.
His earliest references are pretty brief (1 Thessalonians 1:9–10 and
4:13–14, c. 51 CE; Galatians 1:1, c. 54 CE). The most extensive
account is in 1 Corinthians 15:3–8 (c. 56 CE):
For I handed on to you as of first importance what I also
received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the
scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the
third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared
to Cephas [Peter], and then to the Twelve. Then he appeared to
more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, from
whom most remain until now, though some have fallen asleep.
Then he appeared to James [the brother of Jesus], and then to all
the apostles. Last of all, as though to a miscarriage, he appeared
also to me.
—1 Corinthians 15:3–8
Because Paul refers in 1 Corinthians to a tradition about the resur-
rection that he received from the other followers of Jesus, this res-
urrection tradition predates him and may go back to his first visits
with the companions of Jesus in the late 30s and early 40s CE
(Galatians 1:13–24; Acts 7:54–8:3; 9:1–30). Paul tells us little about
the historical Jesus apart from this tradition (see only 1
Corinthians 11:23–26; Romans 1:3; 9:5; 2 Corinthians 5:16). Clearly,
the resurrection is, in his view, the most important aspect of the
Christian proclamation (1 Corinthians 15:14–20).
Chapter 15: The Resurrection: From the Messiah to the Son of God 241

The gospels and The Acts of the
Apostles: Developing stories of
the empty tomb
The gospel narratives expand on the resurrection proclamation by
supplying stories of what the first eyewitnesses actually saw. The
gospels all agree on the following details:
 Jesus died on the cross, and female disciples (Mary
Magdalene’s name is constant) were there to testify to it (Mark
15:37–41; Matthew 27:50–56; Luke 23:46–49; John 19:25–30).
 Jesus was buried in a tomb by Joseph of Arimathea on the
eve of the Sabbath (Mark 15:42–47; Matthew 27:57–61; Luke
23:50–56; John 19:38–42). Mark says that Joseph was a

Which Christian holiday is more important,
Christmas or Easter?
The massive marketing blitz and gift-buying frenzy that rev up every November and
December lead many people to think that Christmas is the most important holiday for
Christians. But the traditions of the Easter celebration run longer and deeper, tracing
back to the earliest days when Christians began gathering to eat the Lord’s Supper
(see Chapter 14).
The first evidence for an annual Easter holiday is the mid-second century CE, when
a debate broke out among Christians about how closely to follow the Jewish cal-
endar. Should the celebration occur on the first day of Passover, which can fall on
any day of the week, or on the following Sunday, after the resurrection day in the
gospels? The question wasn’t settled until the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. Since
then, however, Western and Eastern Orthodox Christians have developed different
practices. All Christians celebrate Easter on or after the first full moon after the
Spring Equinox, but they all use different calendars that calculate the Spring Equinox
and the moons differently.
The name Easter, which is used in English- and German-speaking countries, is taken
from a pre-Christian spring festival for Eostur, the Anglo-Saxon Goddess of the Dawn
(Venerable Bede, On the Reckoning of Time 15).
The first evidence of Christian celebrations for Christ’s birth comes from Clement of
Alexandria in about 200 CE, but he finds the custom strange; it seems he found it more
reasonable to try to calculate the year of Jesus’s birth given the limited gospel evi-
dence (Clement of Alexandria, Miscellanies 1.21). Jesus’s birth doesn’t become a
common tradition celebrated around the Winter Solstice until the fourth century CE.

member of the Sanhedrin (the Jewish assembly composed of
the high priest and other leading priests and Sadducees).
Luke follows that tradition, but Matthew simply says that
Joseph was a rich man. Both Luke and John report that he
was a disciple of Jesus.
 Mary Magdalene found the tomb empty on the first day of
the week, after the Sabbath had ended. In Mark, Matthew, and
Luke, she’s with some other women who have come to anoint
the body (Mark 16:1–8; Matthew 28:1–8; Luke 24:1–11). In
John’s gospel, she comes to the tomb alone (John 20:1–2).
 The risen body of Jesus is real but different. He eats and
bears the wounds of his crucifixion, but he can also appear
suddenly and pass through locked doors. He isn’t a ghost, but
he isn’t immediately recognizable, either.
 Jesus isn’t a zombie. Far from a reanimated corpse enslaved
to some malignant master, Jesus’s flesh has been transformed
and his power unleashed.
Apart from these elements, the accounts in the four gospels and in
the Acts of the Apostles differ.
Mark 16:1–8: The dead end that grows
In Mark, female disciples find the stone rolled away from Jesus’s
tomb, and then they see a young man dressed in white, who tells
them that Jesus has risen and is heading to the Galilee (Mark 8:31;
9:9, 31; 10:34; 14:28). The man commissions the women to report
Jesus’s status to the disciples and Peter. Their response? The
women flee from the tomb astonished and are too terrified to tell
anyone anything. That’s where the earliest manuscripts of Mark’s
gospel end! This ending doesn’t make any sense; if the women
never told anyone about their experiences, how does Mark know
the story? In fact, the ending was so unsatisfactory that later edi-
tors came along and tacked on two new endings, the so-called
“longer ending” (Mark 16:9–20) and “shorter ending” (no verse
numbers).
Matthew 28:1–20: Obeying the man in white
In Matthew’s story, Mark’s young man in white descends from
heaven with an accompanying earthquake and rolls back the stone
before the very eyes of Mary Magdalene and the other women.
Taking a seat on the stone, the man invites the women to see for
themselves that the tomb is empty (the Roman guards who are
posted to prevent Christians from stealing the body see the divine
messenger too, and in a nice bit of gospel irony become “like dead
men”). The man commissions the women to tell the disciples what
has become of Jesus. Unlike in Mark’s original story, the women in
Matthew’s story go tell the disciples, and they also meet Jesus along
Chapter 15: The Resurrection: From the Messiah to the Son of God 243

the way. Jesus appears to the disciples on a mountain in the Galilee
and promises to be with them perpetually, sounding the note of “God
with us,” which is heard in the gospel’s opening scene (Matthew 1:23).
Luke 24:1–53: Breaking bread and opening the Bible
In Luke’s version of the resurrection story, Mary Magdalene and
several other women (at least five) enter the empty tomb and are
puzzled over the missing body. Two men in dazzling clothes appear
to announce that Jesus is raised. They also remind the women of
Jesus’s prophecies to that effect. The women rush to tell the eleven
disciples, who promptly dismiss the report as idle chatter (Luke
won’t tell the story of Judas’s death until Acts 1:18, but in the gospel
there are only eleven of the original Twelve at this meeting). Peter
rushes to the tomb and finds it empty. Luke then provides two
extensive appearance stories:
 The first of these appearances came to two grieving disciples
on the road to Emmaus. The disciples don’t recognize Jesus
until he breaks bread with them, which recalls the Last Supper.
 The second appearance came to the other disciples back in
Jerusalem. The disciples think that they’re seeing a ghost, so
Jesus invites them to look at his hands and feet (presumably
because they bear the wounds from crucifixion). Then he eats
some baked fish with them.
In both of these appearance stories, Jesus interprets the books of
the law, prophets, and psalms to show why his suffering had been
necessary. Finally, Luke recounts how Jesus ascends to heaven from
Bethany, at which point the appearances — and the gospel — stop.
Acts 1:1–12: Seeing proof and hearing a heavenly voice
In Luke’s second volume, The Acts of the Apostles, he says that
Jesus offered “many proofs” over a 40-day period, appearing to his
disciples and speaking about the kingdom of God before ascending
again to heaven. (He doesn’t retell the story of the empty tomb in
this book because he’s already covered that in his gospel.) Paul
also has an experience of the risen Jesus, but because it’s post-
ascension, the experience is usually called a heavenly vision rather
than a resurrection appearance (Acts 26:14–19; for Paul’s version
of this event, see 1 Corinthians 15:8 and possibly 2 Corinthians
12:1–7). Later in the Jerusalem Temple, Paul has an ecstatic experi-
ence in which he both hears and sees Jesus (Acts 22:18).
John 20:1–21:25: Encountering Jesus in the garden
In John’s resurrection story, Mary Magdalene finds the tomb empty,
and being distraught, she runs to tell the other disciples. Peter and
the “beloved disciple” race to the tomb. They both see the burial
cloths, but only the beloved disciple believes that Jesus has risen.
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection 
244

Then Mary, who’s weeping nearby, sees two angels dressed in white
who ask her why she’s weeping. Jesus then does the same, but she
mistakes him for the gardener until he calls her name. He appears
to the other disciples in the room where they’re gathered, despite
the locked doors, and breathes the Holy Spirit on them. Thomas
misses the event and doesn’t believe until he can examine Jesus’s
wounds with his own fingers (a chance he gets a week later).
John also includes a final story about Jesus’s appearance to seven
disciples who are at the Sea of Tiberias (the Sea of Galilee). While in
the Galilee, there’s a miraculous catch of fish and Jesus eats break-
fast with them. Peter also gets a second chance to prove that he
loves Jesus after having denied him three times after Jesus’s arrest.
Comparing the gospels 
to Paul’s letters
Compared to Paul’s letters (which I cover earlier in this chapter),
some differences exist between the resurrection traditions:
 Paul never mentions an empty tomb or the women’s witness.
Are these facts missing because they didn’t happen, because
they weren’t shared with him, or because they didn’t matter?
 Paul mentions more recipients of appearances, particularly
James the brother of Jesus. However, the gospels don’t men-
tion James at all (they only cite appearances to the women,
the eleven surviving members of the Twelve, and unnamed
other disciples). The gospel of the Hebrews does, although it
only survives in snippets quoted by other people.
Scholars think that this is because Paul lived in the first genera-
tion, when an experience of the risen Jesus granted a follower a
sort of higher status (see Acts 1:21–22; 1 Corinthians 9:1–2;
15:5–9). A few decades later when the gospels were written,
most of those eyewitnesses had died, and their relative status
had changed as the Christian movement developed (hence
James isn’t mentioned in the gospel resurrection scenes at all).
Taking Meaning from the Stories
of the Resurrection
All the reports about Jesus’s resurrection and the preaching and
gospel narratives in which they’re couched are written decades after
the event itself. So, they mix early testimony with later reflection on
the event. In the following sections, I tease out those reflections to
Chapter 15: The Resurrection: From the Messiah to the Son of God 245

uncover what the early Christians thought the resurrection meant. I
also show how they tied the resurrection to Jewish scriptures, how
it informed their views of Jesus’s identity, message, and death, and
how it shaped their hope for the end-times.
Connecting the resurrection
to Jewish scripture
In 1 Corinthians, Paul proclaims “Christ crucified, a stumbling
block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles” (1 Corinthians 1:23).
What he means is that the crucifixion of the messiah would sound
pretty odd to just about everyone (as it does to Jews in Acts 2:13
and to Greeks in Acts 17:32). In fact, several stumbling blocks
would have stopped the Jews from believing in a crucified messiah,
including the following:
 The messiah was supposed to succeed. Instead of succeeding,
Jesus was crucified as a criminal by the very power that a kingly
messiah was supposed to overthrow.
 The messiah was supposed to usher in the messianic age.
When the messiah returned, evil and suffering were supposed
to end, once and for all. But in Jesus’s case, the world pretty
much went on as usual, with all its injustices and suffering.
 The messiah was supposed to be embraced by his own
people. Although all of Jesus’s followers were Jews and the
crowds hoped in him, Jesus was rejected by the leaders and
never accepted by the whole people.
These notions about the messiah were rooted in Jewish scripture.
The Jews who followed Jesus were firmly convinced that he was the
messiah; for them, his resurrection was the ultimate vindication. But
if these folks were going to preach to their fellow Jews, they had to
overcome the stumbling blocks by mining scripture on every point
(see Chapter 14 for scriptural allusions in the passion narratives). As
a result of their work, they came up with the following solutions:
 The messiah hadn’t failed. Jesus’s resurrection establishes
his victory over death and evil; he was indeed a king, and he
would return to complete the victory. There was precedent
for a suffering servant in scripture (the four oracles in Isaiah
42:1–4; 49:1–7; 50:4–11; 52:13–53:12; though admittedly, this
prophecy wasn’t about a suffering messiah). There was also a
precedent for the resurrection in the story of Jonah: “Just as
Jonah was in the belly of the sea monster for three days and
three nights, so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth
for three days and three nights” (Matthew 12:39–41 and 16:4 ||
Luke 11:29–30, 32; Mark 8:11–12; Jonah 2:1).
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection 
246

 The messianic age had dawned. The people Jesus healed,
along with his own resurrection, demonstrate and offer “a new
birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
from the dead” (1 Peter 1:3). Evil, death, and corruption no
longer hold him (see Peter’s and Paul’s speeches in Acts
2:24–31; 13:29–39; Psalm 16:8–11; Isaiah 55:3). So, the completion
of the messianic age would come soon, when Jesus returned
(see the nearby sidebar “The rapture and the end-time script”).
 The messiah’s rejection was anticipated, just like the
prophets’ rejection before him was. So, the gospel was to be
taken to the Gentiles (Mark 12:1–12; Q 11:47–51; 14:15–24).
Explaining why the resurrection
matters
For Paul, Jesus’s resurrection redeems the humiliation of the cross.
It gives this central symbol of shame a new purpose and power. In
fact, it’s as if the cross, with its innocent victim, is a gigantic sin
magnet, drawing all the curses of human sin to itself so that they can
be wiped clean by God. For Paul, this is the really good news. And he
couldn’t be clearer that it depends entirely on the resurrection:
. . . [If] Christ was not raised, then our proclamation is empty;
empty, too, your faith . . . [If] Christ was not raised, your faith is
futile; you are still in your sins . . . If in this life alone we have
hoped in Christ, we are the most pitiable people of all. But now
Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who
have fallen asleep.
—1 Corinthians 15:14, 17, 19–20
In the gospels, the resurrection is the climax of the story. But more
than that, it represents Jesus’s vindication. Throughout the plot of
the gospel, Jesus is tested and his identity is questioned by the char-
acters in the story. At the end, he’s killed for claiming an identity too
close to God’s (see Chapter 14 for a historical evaluation of that
charge). For the gospel authors, the resurrection proves once and
for all that Jesus was right, that he was innocent, and that he
enjoys a special relationship with God that extends to believers
(Mark 8:31–38; John 11:25–26).
It’s the resurrection that indicates that there was a purpose to the
suffering and death of Jesus. It’s the resurrection also that encour-
aged early Christians to believe that they too would rise. And it’s
the resurrection that quickened the Christian belief that Jesus was
more than a man or a messiah. If God had saved Jesus from death
itself, Jesus had a unique relationship to God indeed.
Chapter 15: The Resurrection: From the Messiah to the Son of God 247

Giving names to Jesus
The resurrection led Jesus’s followers to believe not only that he had
a unique relationship to God, but also that he was superior to other
luminaries like King David and the angels (Psalm 110 is interpreted to
this end in 1 Corinthians 15:25; Matthew 22:41–46; Acts 2:29–36;
Hebrews 1:13; 10:13). These folks developed titles for Jesus to reflect
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection 
248
The rapture and the end-time script
The gospels, Paul, and the book of Revelation provide a “script” for the end-times
that has remained popular to this day. Paul says:
“For the Lord himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of an archangel
and with the trumpet blast of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in
Christ will rise first. Then we the living, who are left behind, will be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. In this way we will
always be with the Lord. So console one another with these words” (1
Thessalonians 4:16–18).
When Paul’s original Greek was translated into Latin, the Greek word for “caught
up” was translated with the Latin verb rapiemur, meaning to be seized, snatched, or
torn away. This translation gave rise to the term “rapture” for the general resur-
rection of the living. In Paul’s gospel, the rapture is simultaneous with the end, and
it’s a consoling word for the faithful. But in the book of Revelation and in the read-
ings of some Christian groups, it isn’t exactly the last moment in the end-time script.
The following elaborate sequence of end-time events was developed:
 First coming of Christ: The gospels narrate this event.
 Tribulation: This event includes wars, natural disasters, the persecution of
believers, and the rise of false prophets and messiahs; meanwhile, the gospel
spreads to all nations (Mark 13:7–23; 2 Thessalonians 2:3–7; Revelation 2:10;
7:14).
 Rapture: The gospels don’t mention this event. For Paul, it seems to be the gen-
eral resurrection of believers (1 Thessalonians 4:16–18). Some Christians think
that the rapture will happen before the tribulation (Revelation 12:5).
 Millennium: The millennium, or the 1,000-year reign of Christ, isn’t mentioned
in the gospels or in Paul. In Revelation 20, the millennium seems to split the
period of tribulation. Today, some Christians, called premillennialists, believe
this event is inaugurated by the second coming, but others, called postmillen-
nialists and amillennialists, associate it with the Church’s work on earth.
 Second coming, final judgment: Revelation expands on the gospel vision of a
coming son of man and a final judgment by adding a final defeat of Satan and a
vision of the new Jerusalem (Revelation 20:7–22:5). Some Christians place the
second coming earlier in the script, but they keep the judgment at the end.

their beliefs. The titles people developed reflected their Christology,
or view of Jesus as the Christ or messiah. Christological views can be
arrayed on a continuum between the following two types:
 Low Christological views: Many of the titles used for Jesus in
the New Testament are the sort of names you might use for
any person. They reflect a low Christology, or, in other words, a
way of talking about Christ that emphasizes his human nature.
 High Christological views: These titles reflect the post-
resurrection view that Jesus is more than a human appointed
by God for a specific mission. These titles demonstrate a high
Christology, meaning a perspective that emphasizes Jesus’s
unique status tending toward the view that Jesus is divine.
Table 15-1 lays out the low Christological titles on the left, the high
Christological titles on the right, and those that merge features of
both in the middle. After each title is a rough count of how many
times that title occurs in the New Testament. This is just a rough
grid; in practice, each title was understood in a variety of ways.

Out of all the titles that Jesus maintains, the only one that the his-
torical Jesus may have used of himself besides “Jesus” or “son of
Joseph” was “Son of Man.” Scholars think that Jesus may have
used this title because it’s his regular form of self-reference in the
Chapter 15: The Resurrection: From the Messiah to the Son of God 249

earliest gospel, Mark, and because it was a common term synony-
mous with “human being.” At times, it looks like that’s all that the
gospel authors mean by it too (for example, Mark 8:31; Matthew
8:20; Luke 9:58). But at other points, the gospel authors follow the
book of Daniel, and apply the title “Son of Man” to Jesus as a kind
of heavenly figure who will come to rule the world (Q 17:24; Mark
8:38; 13:26; in Daniel 7:13–14, this figure isn’t an individual but
rather the glorified people of Israel).
Two titles emerge as clear favorites — “Messiah/Christ” and “Lord.”
“Lord” was a term used for human masters or superiors and also
for God. The title “Messiah” or “Christ” was reserved for a desig-
nated human agent of God who would restore the kingdom, the
Temple, or the world in a definitive way. Because Jesus hadn’t done
this — or at least had not completed it — some of his followers
apparently thought that his status as messiah would begin when he
returned (see Acts 3:20–22). But most other followers christened
him “Christ” in the interim so that already in Paul’s letter to the
Romans “Christ” sounds like his proper name (Romans 9:5). This
title is so characteristic of the early believers that within a genera-
tion they are already being called Christians themselves.
The title “Son of God” or references to Jesus as God’s son don’t nec-
essarily imply divinity, because they had been used of Israel’s kings
(Psalm 2:7–9) and of the whole people in Israel before (Exodus 4:22;
Deuteronomy 1:31; 8:5; Psalm 82:6). But as Christianity developed,
Christians redefined titles like “Son of Man” and “Son of God” to
describe Jesus’s unique relationship to God (1 Thessalonians 1:10;
Romans 1:3–4; Hebrews 2:6–9; John 5:17–29; 10:30–39; Revelation
14:14–16). In some groups, the notion develops quite early that this
Son was with God but subordinate to God even before his earthly
life (Philippians 2:6; John 1:1–14).
John’s gospel, which calls Jesus “the Son of God,” “the preexistent
Word,” and even “God,” adds to these high Christological titles a
whole bunch of additional and colorful metaphors, including
 Lamb of God (John 1:29, 36)
 Bread of Life (John 6:35)
 Light of the World (John 8:12)
 Good Shepherd (John 10:11)
 Resurrection (John 11:25)
 Vine (John 15:1)
John’s unique terms reveal a common characteristic of all these
titles in the New Testament: Their meanings depend on their
authors’ changing understandings of who Jesus is.

250

Battling over Jesus in 
the Early Church
Christians have never unanimously agreed about who Jesus was.
From the beginning, Christians had many witnesses, competing
memories, and different viewpoints, and that diversity only
increased as Christianity spread into the Greek-speaking world.
Getting a grip on Greco-Roman
beliefs
The increasing number of Gentile converts came to the Christian
community with their own assumptions about heaven and earth
and the nature of the gods (Gentiles are non-Jews). These differing
assumptions posed challenges and created opportunities for the
early Christian leaders (as you discover later in this chapter).
Making humans divine
The Greeks and Romans had a long tradition of worshipping many
gods and heroes. It was commonplace in their lore to find ancient
heroes who had undergone an apotheosis, or deification, after their
lives (these two words both mean “to become divine”). In those
days, some heroes had unusual births, too. For example, some
were born to divine mothers and human fathers, such as Achilles,
Persephone, and Aeneas, and others were the children of divine
fathers and human mothers, such as Hercules, Perseus, and Plato.
This tradition extended to some rulers as well, notably Alexander
the Great and Augustus Caesar.
The stories of divine conception and apotheosis helped to explain
the superior accomplishments of a person by allowing people to
imagine that these godlike folks had an infusion of supernatural
power or spirit. In the case of living or recent figures, such as
Alexander and Augustus, the stories promoted the veneration that
they and their heirs believed they deserved for the benefits that
they brought to the people.
These traditions of heroic men becoming divine influenced how the
gospel authors conveyed the significance of their hero, Jesus. You
see this most clearly in the infancy narratives in Matthew and Luke,
where Jesus is conceived with the intervention of God and divine
signs accompany his birth. After all, nothing says “divine” like a
miraculous birth! In early Christianity, Jesus is venerated for the
benefits he was thought to bring, much as these other heroes were.
Chapter 15: The Resurrection: From the Messiah to the Son of God 251

Speculating divine hierarchies
Many Greeks and Romans believed in multiple gods, as the temples
scattered around the Mediterranean region attest. But the Greek
and Roman philosophers had shifted toward a hierarchy that sug-
gested a single prefect being at the source of divine power. For the
fourth century BCE Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle, for
example, this god and the lesser deities beneath it were eternal, so
they couldn’t be born. Also, they had no need for sex, food, or
sleep, and they couldn’t be injured.
By the time of Jesus, there were several different philosophies that
were popular in the Mediterranean world. For example, consider
the views of the following two prominent groups:
 The Middle Platonists: This group viewed God as a kind of full-
ness that overflowed into the world of matter. The highest or
purest form of God was eternal, unchangeable, and rational,
and the Middle Platonists referred to this being as the supreme
God or simply “the Good.” This supreme God, or rather the
mind or reason of this God (called the Logos or “Word”), over-
flowed into the realm of matter, creating an ordered cosmos.
Humans are part of the cosmos, embodying a bit of the divine
by virtue of their “reason” or “spirit,” but also composed of
matter. In this system, matter is passive and subject to change,
while God is active and changeless. So, if people wanted to be
like God, they had to resist the pull of matter and cultivate the
capacity for reason instead.
 The Stoics: These folks considered the Logos the supreme
God rather than a sort of secondary deity, and they imagined
this God to be a being that was very much involved in the
world. The goal of the Stoics was to live in agreement with
nature. They were more optimistic than the Middle Platonists
that human reason could govern the body, and they advocated
a disciplined lifestyle to keep the mind in top form.
The ideas of the Middle Platonists and the Stoics had little impact
on the historical Jesus, as far as we can tell. But they would have
an impact on how Jesus came to be understood in the Greco-
Roman world (see the next section).
Fitting Jesus into Greco-Roman
thinking
In order to make the Christian message intelligible for the Gentiles,
Christian preachers and teachers had to translate their ideas about
their risen messiah into the local lingo of Greeks and Romans. Paul
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection 
252

admitted how difficult this translation could be when he called the
Christ crucified “foolishness” to the Gentiles.
In principle, especially in the Roman system, there was often room
in the pantheon for new gods. And the Greeks and Romans both
had some experience with divinized men (as I explain earlier in
this chapter). But Christians were claiming something else: They
claimed that the risen Christ rose bodily, that a risen body and
divine being were both present in him, and that his followers had
seen him (not merely visions of him, but him) after he rose. It’s no
wonder that the Athenian philosophers laughed Paul right off the
Areopagus (Acts 17:16–34).
The Greco-Roman philosophical categories of divine and human, or
spirit and matter, resisted the fusion that Christian belief made. In
their eyes, God was perfect, unchanging, and eternal, but humans
were subject to change and death. Gods didn’t eat, drink, or sleep,
but Jesus did. Jesus’s death and the fact that he ate, drank, and
slept, is no problem if you’re talking about the historical Jesus, but
it is a problem if you’re trying to convince an educated person in
second century Alexandria that this Jesus was and is the son of
God. The following sections discuss different groups of Christians
that tried to define Jesus’s human and divine nature in the Greco-
Roman categories they had inherited.
The apologists: Introducing Logos Christology
Christianity attracted educated men, and these men began to frame
Christian beliefs in philosophical terms. These scholar-pastors were
called apologists (“defenders” or “advocates” of a teaching). They
acknowledged that the Bible often spoke of the divine “in language
unworthy of God.” Convinced that the Bible was God’s word, they
presumed deeper meanings were embedded there that they could
tease out, and they used philosophy to do it. They had to go beyond
the Bible to make the case for Christ.
The first thing the apologists had to work out was Jesus’s relation-
ship with God. They were monotheists, so the last thing they
wanted to do was imply that Jesus was a second god, or that the
Holy Spirit was a third. They had to maintain the unity of God and
the diversity within God (Jesus’s divinity) at the same time.
Middle Platonism (see the earlier section “Speculating divine hierar-
chies”) offered an available resource to solve the problem. Here was
a system with one Supreme God who “gave off” or emanated reason.
This reason, or Logos, was one with God but also interfaced with the
world. Several Christian apologists like Justin Martyr (c. 100–165 CE)
began to work up a “Logos Christology,” a high Christological view
that saw Christ as this emanation or Word of God. In fact, John’s
gospel was already starting to go in this direction in the late first
century (see John 1:1–18).
Chapter 15: The Resurrection: From the Messiah to the Son of God 253

The apologists were “translating” the Christian message into terms
that made sense to other educated persons, and this attracted
more people from those classes to the Christian faith (although it
also drew scorn from others).
Pushing back to protect divine transcendence: 
Marcion and the Docetists
Some Christians shared the view of the apologists that God and
Christ were related, but they took that relationship in another
direction. They didn’t like the Logos Christology because it wasn’t
“high” enough. In their view, it didn’t make Christ seem Godlike
enough. Marcion of Sinope (c. 110–160 CE) and a group called the
Docetists both believed this, but they focused on different things.
Marcion thought that the God of the Jewish scriptures was unwor-
thy of being called “God” at all. After all, this God, the “Logos,” had
created the material world and acted unworthily in the Bible. For
Marcion, Jesus was superior to the Logos because he came directly
from the Supreme God and revealed that God to the world for the
first time through his superior teaching. Marcion jettisoned all the
Jewish scriptures because he thought they came from the Logos,
and then he stripped every reference to those scriptures from the
Christian books as well. As a result, his Bible was pretty small.
Other teachers, troubled by the notion that the Supreme God
would require the shameful suffering and death that Jesus
endured, couldn’t imagine that Christ actually became human at
all. If he truly was an emanation of the Supreme God, he couldn’t
eat, drink, suffer, or die. It was a generous act of divine mercy to
make him seem or appear human so that people could comprehend
him, but he wasn’t actually human at all. This docetic Christology
(from doke∂, or “to seem or appear”) was popular in many circles.
Hammering out an orthodox teaching
Some of the Christian bishops and leaders in the first couple of cen-
turies, who were apologists in their own right, rejected the negative
views of Jewish scripture and the material world that Marcion and
the docetists presumed (see the preceding section). So, they coun-
tered by stating more clearly who they thought Christ was, and then
they confidently labeled their teaching orthodox (“right opinion” or
“right teaching”). But even among these orthodox leaders, some
sticking points still remained. One of the toughest, for example, was
that Christians had to figure out how to talk about the unity and
diversity within God, and especially about the relationship between
God the Father and Jesus Christ the son. They worked these issues
out over a couple of centuries of debates as they tackled particular
questions about Jesus.
Part IV: Witnessing Jesus’s Execution and Resurrection

Defining degrees of divinity
One of the most intractable points among Christian believers was
the relationship of God and Christ; here, the Logos Christology
(which I cover earlier in this chapter) was as much a part of the
problem as it was a part of the solution. A lot of people felt that the
two beings still sounded like two separate gods, so they insisted
that the Supreme God — not some subsidiary emanation — was
incarnate in Christ (although they differed among themselves in
exactly how this worked). These folks were called the Monarchians.
Others, like Tertullian of Carthage (155–230 CE), countered that
this theory would mean that God suffered, which they couldn’t
accept. So, Tertullian and others like him began to speak of a single
God who expressed himself in three ways (father, son, and spirit),
and of a Christ who was one person, but two substances (flesh and
spirit, or human and divine).
Arius (c. 250–336 CE), who granted that Christ the Logos was
divine, doubted that he was of the same degree of divinity as the
Supreme God. Because the Christ was begotten of God, and God
isn’t begotten, Arius reasoned that Christ couldn’t be God (clear as
mud, right?). In other words, this wasn’t a case of low Christology,
but a case of not-quite-high-enough Christology. Arius thought
Christ was divine, just not as divine as the Supreme God.
Settling on substance: The Council of Nicaea
Something had to be done to settle the situation among the com-
peting groups of Christian believers. The first step was to sort out
the relationship of God the Father, Jesus Christ the son, and the
Holy Spirit. So, a council of Christian bishops was called in 325 CE
at the Emperor Constantine’s palace in the Turkish town of Nicaea.
At this council, the bishops settled on the formula that Christ was
“of the same substance as the Father.” Some folks attempted to
change the language later, but the “same substance” language was
ratified in the Nicene Creed in 381 CE. This creed remains the doc-
trine in most Christian denominations today.
Examining the Christological conflicts
The Council of Nicaea may have sorted out Jesus’s relationship to
God the Father and to the Holy Spirit, but it left some unanswered
questions about Jesus himself.
For instance, the Nicene Creed stated that Christ was two natures
and one person. For some believers, however, that didn’t keep God
and man separate enough. In the early 400s CE, Nestorius, the
Patriarch in Constantinople, said that Christ was two natures and
two persons, the divine Logos and the man Jesus. He thought that
Chapter 15: The Resurrection: From the Messiah to the Son of God 255

Mary bore the man Jesus, but not the divine part of him, and so he
rejected Mary’s title of Theotokos, or God-bearer.
Some Christians rebuffed Nestorius’s position at the Council of
Ephesus in 431. But his position remains the belief of the Assyrian
Church of the East and the Assyrian/East Syrian Church. Some
denominations of these churches, like the Chaldean Catholics (in
Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Lebanon) have changed their beliefs and are
now in communion with the Roman Catholic Church.
Other Christians took the opposite position to correct Nestorius. If
Nestorius laid the emphasis on two persons and so risked dividing
Christ, the Monophysites countered that Christ wasn’t just one
person but also one undivided nature (monophysis literally means
“one undivided nature”). There were a couple of different versions
of this Christology. One said that Jesus’s human nature was basi-
cally obliterated in his divinity (this view is called Eutychianism).
Another Christology held that Jesus kept a human body and soul,
but his human mind was overtaken by the divine Logos (this view
is called Apollinarianism).
Monophysite teachings were condemned at the Council of Chalcedon
in 451 CE. The council taught that Jesus Christ was and is truly God
and truly man, and that these natures remain distinct despite the
union of them in one person. This dyophysite, or “two-natures” posi-
tion is the faith of the Eastern Orthodox denomination, the Roman
Catholic denomination, and most Protestant denominations today.
The majority position wasn’t unanimous, however. The Oriental
Orthodox Churches rejected Chalcedon. They agreed that there
were two natures, but they felt that these natures were united not
in one person but in one nature. They prefer to call their position
miaphysite, or “one nature,” rather than monophysite. This way they
indicate that they agree with the two-natures notion to a degree.
The following modern-day churches adhere to this doctrine:
 The Armenian Apostolic Church
 The British Orthodox Church of the UK
 The Coptic Orthodox Church
 The French Orthodox Church in France
 The Indian Orthodox Church
 The Syriac (or Syrian) Orthodox Church

Jesus, the Palestinian Jewish preacher, ended up with a global

spread of Christianity occur? You find out in this chapter. I help you

from the period of the imperial persecution to the imperial adoption
of Christianity, view the various ways that Jesus was worshipped,
see the conflict and creativity as Christ was made over into an agent
of empire, and discover what other religions say about Jesus.
Crowning Jesus as Cosmic King
Early Christians came to believe that Jesus ruled the universe with
God. In their eyes, he was already a cosmic king and was painted in
contrast to the earthly rulers. And within three centuries, the
emperors arrayed against Jesus came to embrace him as well. This
coalition of heavenly and earthly power presented both opportuni-
ties and serious challenges for followers of the humble Jewish car-
penter from the Galilee, as you find out in the following sections.
The spirit-driven life of Jesus’s followers
Christians in the first century believed that Jesus was alive and well.
It wasn’t that they believed he had risen and was simply twiddling
his thumbs somewhere up in heaven. No, they wrote in their letters

and gospels that he was “at the right hand of God,” which was their
way of saying that Jesus was God’s power in the world (Mark 14:62;
Acts 5:31; 7:55–56; Romans 8:34; Ephesians 1:15–23; Colossians 3:1;
Hebrews 12–13; 1 Peter 3:22). They believed that Jesus would return
soon, and they even prayed for it (as in 1 Corinthians 16:22). As I
explain in the following sections, they believed that Jesus’s spirit
had filled them and was working in them as they took the gospel to
whoever would listen. And their identification with Jesus only deep-
ened as they began to be persecuted by the Roman authorities for
worshipping Jesus as God.
Spreading the word
Taking the message of the risen Jesus on the road was central to
the gospel because the earliest believers wanted to gather in all the
nations before Jesus returned. The following things propelled them:
 The interpretation of prophecy: Jesus’s followers believed
that one day all nations would worship God (Isaiah 42:6 and
49:6 are echoed in Luke 2:32 and Acts 13:47). They wanted to
help that prophecy come true by converting all the nations.
 The failure of the Jewish mission and the success among non-
Jews: Many Jews rejected the claim that Jesus was the messiah,
while many Gentiles (non-Jews) accepted it. In fact, the early
Christians came to believe that God’s promise extended to Jews
and Gentiles (Romans 9–11; Acts 13:44–52). Later Christians
kicked the Jews out of the equation entirely, saying that God had
picked a new “Israel” (the Christians) that didn’t include the old
one at all. (In recent decades, several Christian churches have
disavowed that teaching.)
 The sense that they had been commissioned by Christ: Early
Christians came to believe that Jesus had commanded them
to gather believers all over the world (Mark 13:10; Matthew
28:16–20; John 17:18; 20:21–22; Acts 10:42–43).
 The desire to share forgiveness: After being inspired and
motivated by God’s mercy and forgiveness, Christians wanted
everyone to feel the love (Romans 5:1–21; 2 Corinthians 4:1–15;
5:11–21).
Motivated by these beliefs, early Christians began traveling
throughout the Mediterranean, North Africa, and as far east as
India to spread the good news about Jesus. Our evidence for how
they did this is limited to Paul’s letters, the later Acts of the Apostles,
and apocryphal acts of apostles that date even later. Several apostles
went in different directions (Galatians 2:7–9; Mark 6:8–11), taking
their wives with them (1 Corinthians 9:5) and possibly earning their
keep by preaching and miracles (1 Corinthians 9:3–18).
Part V: Experiencing Christ in Culture 
260

Chapter 16: A Western Savior Goes Global 261
Worshipping Jesus as God and becoming martyrs
The Christian belief that Jesus is divine grew out of the resurrection
experience (see Chapter 15). By 112 CE, we have Roman evidence
that Christians were singing hymns to Christ “as to a God” (from
the Roman governor of Bithynia-Pontus in Turkey, Pliny the Younger,
Letter 10.96). This new belief in Jesus is a problem for Pliny because
it means that these folks won’t pray and offer incense and wine to
the Roman gods and to the image of the emperor. Those Pliny can’t
torture into recanting, he executes for insubordination and atheism
(which literally means “without [the right] gods”).
When Christians resisted Roman religion, it set them apart from
other imperial subjects, including their own families. This caused
social tension that occasionally erupted into political trouble and
led rulers to execute early Christian leaders, including the following:
 The Hellenist deacon Stephen (Acts 7:54–60)
 James the brother of John, who was a member of the Twelve
(Acts 12:1–3)
 Peter, a member of the Twelve, and Paul, an apostle to the
Gentiles after Jesus’s death and resurrection (John 21:18–19;
Acts 21:10–11; 1 Clement 4–5)
Because Jesus had been executed, Christians understood that they
too might die (Q 12:4–9; Mark 8:34–38; Revelation 7:9–17; 17:6). They
wanted their deaths to testify to their faith. That’s why they’re called
martyrs, or “witnesses” — their choice to resist pressure and remain
true to their faith was a compelling witness to Christ.
Stories proliferated about how these martyrs had been “perfected”
by suffering death as Jesus had. Consider what Ignatius of Antioch
said on his way to the lions (yes, wild animals were a common
death sentence back in the day!): “Let me become an imitator of
the passion of my God” (Ignatius, Epistle to the Romans 6.3). People
came to view the martyrs as the crucified Christ, such as the
believers who reportedly saw Christ in the slave girl Blandina’s
body on the cross (Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History 5.1.41, 55–56).
The persecutions were only occasional and local in the first cen-
turies of Christian history but escalated dramatically in the third
century, when Rome began to blame Christians for all its troubles.
Rome began to suffer military defeats at the hands of “barbarians,”
and its citizens began to wonder why the gods had lifted their veil
of protection. The Christian atheists were targeted in empirewide
persecutions under the emperors Maximinus (235–238), Decius
(who persecuted Christians between 250 and 251), Diocletian (his
persecution occurred from 303–305), and Galerius (305–311).

The conversion of Constantine
The Roman Emperor Constantine, who reigned from 306–337, took
many pro-Christian steps during his reign that had an enormous
impact on the history of the West. As the story goes, Constantine’s
conversion to Christianity came on October 28, 312 CE, during the
Battle of the Milvian Bridge in Rome. He had a vision of a cross of
light in the sky and the Greek words en touto nika (“in this con-
quer”). Taking this vision to heart, he inscribed the symbol of
Christ (a form of the cross) on his flags and his soldiers’ shields
and won the battle, effectively taking over the entire Western
Empire (Eusebius, Life of Constantine 27–32).
Emboldened by his success, Constantine returned the favor by
legalizing the Christian religion in the Edict of Milan in 313 CE. He
even supported the construction of Christian basilicas, such as Old
Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome and later the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre in Jerusalem (see Chapter 20 for more on this holy site).
He also convened the bishops of the East and West at the Council
of Nicaea so that he could help them get their act together regard-
ing teachings about God’s relationship to Jesus (see Chapter 15 for
more on this meeting of the bishops).
Despite these major pro-Christian moves, Constantine didn’t take
the final step to become Christian himself until the end of his life.
Clearly, the political advantages of unifying the Christians and
solidifying their status were a bigger priority for him than taking
the baptismal plunge. Plus, most of the Roman leadership was still
pagan, so until his death, he had to walk a fine line between his
new religious beliefs and the traditions of the empire.
Sanctioning Christianity
After 60 years of power shifts between pagans (who worshipped the
Roman gods), Arians (who thought that Jesus was of lower rank than
God the Father), and Nicene Christians (who thought that Jesus was of
the same substance as the Father), Theodosius, the latest emperor,
had had enough. He made the Christianity practiced by the Bishops of
Rome and Alexandria the only legal religion in the empire in 380 CE.
This switch from persecuted religion to official religion rocked the
Christian world. Instead of being executed for their beliefs (as I
explain in the earlier section “Worshipping Jesus as God and
becoming martyrs”), now people were being rewarded with power
and prestige for being Christian. People felt that God’s kingdom
had fused with the Roman Empire (for the impact of this belief on
artistic representations of Jesus, see Chapter 17). It took great
intellects like the North African Bishop Augustine to remind
Part V: Experiencing Christ in Culture 
262

Christians that no human nation, however glorious, is the be-all
and end-all. Augustine thought that the only “city” that could fulfill
human hopes was the city of God — not Rome, and not even the
Christian Church (Augustine, The City of God). As you’ll see, that
lesson was often forgotten in Western history.
Bringing Jesus into Daily Life
Popular portrayals of and devotions to Christ after the fall of the
Roman Empire focused less on political power and more on lifestyle
choices. The average Christian, for instance, met Jesus in the
Eucharist (also known as Holy Communion today), relived his life
through spiritual disciplines, and revered him for his love and
sacrifice, as I show you in the following sections.
Celebrating the presence of Christ
From the fourth century on, the one place that most Christians felt
they encountered Christ was in the bread of their Eucharistic litur-
gies. The prayer of the service was directed to God the Father, but
Christians believed that they encountered Christ in the bread and
wine, which they understood to be the “body” and “blood” of their
Lord (based on the accounts of the Last Supper in Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and Paul; see Chapter 14). Reverence for Christ’s presence in
the Eucharist began to grow in the Eastern and Western churches.
Imitating Christ
Christians showed their devotion to Christ by imitating his life.
They had always done this: some by adopting lifestyles as itinerant
preachers, others by enduring martyrdom (which I cover earlier in
this chapter), and others still by caring for the poor and sick. But
when the era of martyrdom ended and conversion became desir-
able (just after the Roman Emperor Constantine in the fourth cen-
tury, whom I discuss earlier in this chapter), serious believers had
to find other ways to show their Christian values.
Sacrificing worldly desires
One path that many Christians took to mimic Jesus’s life was
asceticism, from a Greek word for “physical exercise.” Only these
Christians weren’t going down to the gym every day to work out.
Instead, they were renouncing the “desires of the flesh.” They
demonstrated their commitment to their spirits by exercising
vigilance over their bodies. For instance, they restricted their diets,
secluded themselves in caves, and abstained from sex. Some thought
these folks were crazy, but others considered them to be holy.
Chapter 16: A Western Savior Goes Global 263

Practicing poverty and tending to the sick
Not everyone thought that it was a good idea to hole up in a cave
and disengage from the secular world. In a different way of imitat-
ing Christ, several individuals embraced particular attributes of
Christ (such as poverty, itinerancy, and simplicity) and founded
movements with like-minded devotees.
Francis of Assisi (1181–1226), for example, was perhaps the most
well known and well loved. He was raised in a wealthy Italian
family, but he renounced it all in order to live a life of voluntary
poverty and itinerant preaching. Famous for nursing lepers and
receiving the stigmata, or the wounds of Christ (see Chapter 14 for
more about stigmata), Francis modeled his life on Jesus’s life. He
did so in conscious contrast to both the secular power of his
family and the growing wealth and political power of the Church.
Catherine of Siena (1347–1380) is regarded as a “Doctor of the
Church” in the Catholic tradition because of her prominent role of
advising popes during a period of schism. She adopted such a
Part V: Experiencing Christ in Culture 
264
The legend of the blood libel
The devotion to the sufferings of Christ unfortunately had a dark side. This dark side
came from the way this devotion perpetuated a fear of the Jews, because as the
gospels record it, “the Jews” supposedly were responsible for Jesus’s death
(Chapters 13 and 14 explain how unhistorical that charge is). Any devotion that
focuses on Jesus’s suffering has the potential to stir up animosity toward the Jews
and a fear of the threat they supposedly posed. In truth, however, the Jews were the
ones who were threatened by Christians, because Christians were in power.
Nevertheless, Christians projected their paranoia in a particularly insidious legend
called the blood libel.
This legend is a weird reversal of the crucifixion narrative. Christians imagined that,
come Passover, Jews would kidnap a Christian child and take it into a back room
where they would slit its throat and drain the blood to use in baking the Passover
matzah (or unleavened bread). There was never any truth to this rumor, and it was
absurd to boot. After all, consuming the blood of animals is prohibited in Leviticus
7:26–27, so obviously human blood is out of the question too! But, unfortunately, this
legend was like an undying ember that could be fanned into flame whenever Good
Friday rolled around or a Christian child went missing.
Starting in England in 1144, there have been over 150 cases of blood libel accusa-
tions, where innocent Jews were arrested, accused of killing a Christian child, and,
tragically, often executed. The most recent cases took place in Russia (1911) and in
Germany under Hitler (1933–1945), and this appalling legend lives on in anti-Semitic
propaganda today.

strict ascetic life (living only on the Eucharist for a time) that her
death at a young age was probably due to complications from
anorexia. But she also experienced a “mystical marriage” with
Christ that led her to go out on the streets and tend to the sick and
the poor, tasks that she identified with Jesus’s work during his life.
Loving Christ
The Middle Ages (from the 5th century to the 15th century) saw a
new development in the West — an explosion of interest in the human
person visible in everything from the exuberant stained glass in
Gothic cathedrals to the literary humanism of the great medieval
scholastics. It also led to a new focus on Jesus the man that stressed
his suffering for others and cultivated a response of grateful love.
Celebrating the human Jesus and imagining his suffering
One of the most famous medieval expressions of Jesus’s humanity
was the intimate portrait of the baby Jesus with his mother that
began popping up in the 1200s. The first “Madonna” wasn’t today’s
cone-wearing, Kabbalah-practicing singer, but rather Jesus’s
mother (from the Italian mia donna, or “my lady”). In the same cen-
tury, Francis of Assisi popularized the Christmas crèche, which is
the manger scene in which animals and shepherds join the holy
family at Jesus’s birth. (See the earlier section “Practicing poverty
and tending to the sick” for an introduction to Francis of Assisi.)
The Middle Ages also saw an emphasis on the suffering of Christ,
such as artistic depictions of his death (see Chapter 17) and devo-
tional practices like imitating Jesus’s final walk to his crucifixion. The
nearby sidebar “The legend of the blood libel” reveals the dark side
of this empathy.
Finding a soul mate in Jesus
In the 1500s, great medieval monastics, such as Bernard of Clairvaux,
and mystics, such as John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila, prayed
fervently for a union with Christ and, through him, for a union with
God. While their intense romantic language has fallen out of favor
with modern folks, their image of the soul searching for its rest con-
tinues to frame the Western quest for spiritual satisfaction even as
that quest moves beyond Christianity.
Imposing the Message of Jesus
in an Age of Empire
The gospel charge that says Christians should take Jesus’s mes-
sage abroad was reinvigorated when Christian empires such as
Chapter 16: A Western Savior Goes Global 265

Spain and England consolidated from the 16th to the 19th cen-
turies. When they managed to mount enough military muscle to
expand beyond their borders, they took the Christian message
with them. All these countries had practiced their expansionist
impulses on the European continent first, but when the territory
they desired was controlled by Muslims (during the Crusades,
1095–1492) or by non-Christians (during the exploration of Asia,
Australia, and the Western Hemisphere), it added a new kind of
religious motivation to the mix.
Taking Jesus’s message to the colonies
The discovery of the “new world” in 1492 and the improved seafar-
ing traffic to Africa, Asia, and Australia during the next three cen-
turies gave Europeans access to unprecedented populations of
unbelievers. Unlike during the Crusades, Christians during this
time had the political, military, and economic muscle to colonize
the regions and organize them for the enrichment of the home
country. So for 450 years, the European nations carved up Asia, the
Middle East, Africa, Latin America, North America, and Australia as
they battled with each other at home for dominance. And where
their merchants and military went, their missionaries went as well,
spreading Jesus’s message.
The colonizers believed that their culture and religion were superior
to what they found on “pagan turf.” So, in a process that combined
education, persuasion, and outright force, Christ came to these
cultures as part of the imperial machine. It’s ironic, given that the
historical Jesus was crucified by the empire of his day.
The language of the New Testament was part of the problem. Its
various books envisioned a future in which Jesus would return and
usher in a new age. These books used the rhetoric of the Roman
Empire to envision this new kingdom. They imagined Jesus arriving
at the end of time as a judge on a heavenly steed and crushing his
enemies. They pictured a new earth centered in a restored “new
Jerusalem” that would be a true kingdom of justice and peace
(Revelation 18:1–22:5). The imperial imagery made it easier for the
Europeans to imagine that they were ushering in the new age.
Their subjects, of course, often saw it otherwise, and several of the
missionaries agreed. For example, the Dominican friars Bartolomé
de las Casas (1484–1566) and Antonio de Montesinos recognized
the brutality of their fellow countrymen and challenged it in the
name of Jesus. They couldn’t square the beatings and killings with
the gospel message of Jesus, no matter how much the imperial
rhetoric of the New Testament seemed to authorize it. They also
saw how counterproductive it was to their mission: Who would
want to join a religion whose representatives abused them? So
Part V: Experiencing Christ in Culture 
266

they challenged their governments to improve the treatment of the
indigenous inhabitants in the colonies. These missionaries acted
out of concern for the people and out of disappointment that the
new Jerusalem they hoped to build in the new world was looking
like just another greedy and destructive human kingdom.
Mixing different versions of Christ
in postcolonial cultures
The term postcolonial describes the period after an empire has left
a colonized area. This term refers especially to when the European
empires withdrew from their colonies in the mid-20th century and
the indigenous peoples achieved political emancipation. Their cul-
tural inheritance from Europe proved somewhat more difficult to
dislodge, however. Some indigenous Christians wanted to remain
Christians, but their Christ already looked different.
For instance, during the colonial period and in its wake, the values
and traditions espoused by the empire and the indigenous values
and traditions blended and battled, forging new hybrids. Like cars
that mix electricity and gas, these hybrid cultures blended European
and indigenous elements in a sometimes combustible mix. For
example:
 In Latin America, the hybrid Christ mixed elements of a bibli-
cal liberator and a Marxist revolutionary in a grass-roots
movement called liberation theology. Like the Jesus of the
gospels, this Jesus was a champion of the poor rather than a
friend of the wealthy elites.
 In African cultures, ancestors are revered and Jesus was
ranked among them. Among African women, Jesus was por-
trayed as lover, life giver, and Mother Africa herself, who was
ravaged by Europe.
 Many Asian Christians understood Jesus as an analogy to their
religious prophets, like a western Dalai Lama or bodhisattva.
 In America, slaves and their heirs viewed Christ as a new
Moses who was freeing them from their southern Egypt and as
someone who had shared their profound physical sufferings.
None of these hybrids seems combustible at first glance. But each
dislodged a Christ that Europeans or Americans controlled, so they
often made the former colonizers uncomfortable. On top of that,
the hybrid Christs often criticized the colonizers directly. Take the
African American Jesus: As a kind of Moses, he was freeing the
slaves not from an Egyptian Pharaoh but from Americans, and
Americans weren’t used to thinking of themselves as the biblical
Chapter 16: A Western Savior Goes Global 267

bad guys. Even when the new hybrid Christs didn’t take the West
on directly, they added new and diverse global voices to the mix,
images that challenged westerners’ long-dominant views of Jesus.
Viewing Jesus in World Religions
Jesus is worshiped as God among Christians, but the other major
religions of the world don’t view him in this way. Some neverthe-
less respect him as a moral teacher and prophet. There’s even one
Christian denomination that has a different view of Jesus from
other Christian groups.
Jesus in Mormonism
In 1830, Joseph Smith, Jr., founded the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints (LDS, popularly known as the Mormon Church;
its Web site is www.lds.org). The 13 million or so current LDS
members view their church as the authentic form of Christianity
that was restored in these latter days. LDS members accept the
Christian Bible as revelation, but they also believe that whole parts
of the story are missing and that corruptions entered the text in
the translation process, and so additional divine revelation was
needed. The supplementary revelation is in three books: the Book
of Mormon, the Doctrines and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great
Price. Revelation continues in the office of the President of the
Church, who is considered a living prophet.
Mormon views of Jesus differ from mainstream Christianity in a
number of ways. For instance, in LDS belief:
 The Book of Mormon, compiled between 600 BCE and 421 CE by
Israelite descendents in the Western Hemisphere, prophesies
Christ and records events in the Americas around his birth,
death, and resurrection visit.
 The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit aren’t one as was determined
at the Council of Nicaea (see Chapter 15). Instead, they’re
three separate Personages (three individual beings) of different
rank. Heavenly Father and Son have physical bodies (glorified
and resurrected ones) while the Holy Ghost doesn’t. Heavenly
Father is married to Heavenly Mother, and they literally pro-
created all human spirits. Jesus’s human birth was in turn a lit-
eral birth accomplished by Heavenly Father and Mary.
 Jesus, as Jehovah, took a principal role in the premortal life,
leading the Israelites of the Old Testament. When folks needed
atonement for the inevitable sins that they all would commit
as part of their earthly test, Jesus stepped up to the plate,
Part V: Experiencing Christ in Culture 
268

enabling everyone to be divinized. His great act of atonement
for human sin was the obedience he demonstrated to his
Father’s will in both the Garden of Gethsemane, where he
sweat blood (see Chapter 14) and in his death on the cross.
He continues his redeeming work in the postmortem spirit
world, saving the ancestors of LDS converts. According to LDS
teaching, Jesus is going to restore his kingdom on the
American continent.
 Some 19th-century Mormon leaders taught that Jesus was
married, like all good Mormons, and some even taught that he
had multiple wives (including Mary Magdalene and Martha;
see Chapter 10 for contrary evidence). But this teaching has
gone in and out of favor in the decades since.
 Jesus was the firstborn of the spirit children. All people are just
like him. In other words, everyone has a premortal spiritual
existence (born of Heavenly Father and Mother), everyone
gets time on earth to practice obedience, and everyone gets
the chance for spiritual exaltation or godhood, achieved through
the performance of Temple rites and the atoning act of Jesus.
The Mormon Jesus is the Elder Brother in the family of believ-
ers. He’s a “Father” in terms of his obedience, but he’s not to
be confused with the Father. He’s not a unique divine-human
intermediary but a supreme example of what everyone can be.

Jesus in Judaism
In Judaism, Jesus is viewed neither as the messiah nor as the son
of God. He isn’t divine at all. Instead, Jews simply recognize Jesus
as a first-century Jewish man whose teachings often sound much
like the positions of other rabbis of the period. Some view Jesus as
one of a number of failed messiahs in Jewish history; like the
others, Jesus failed to usher in the messianic age because there’s
still a lot of suffering in the world.
Jewish traditions about Jesus in the Babylonian Talmud were com-
piled sometime in the seventh century CE in a region that wasn’t
under Christian control at the time. Free of the constraints of
Christian imperial religion, the Babylonian rabbis could afford to
be more open in their assessments of Jesus and his followers. The
Talmud preserves several separate traditions:
 Jesus’s mother was an adulteress who had an affair with a
Roman soldier.
 Jesus fled to Egypt and picked up magic there.
Chapter 16: A Western Savior Goes Global 269

 Jesus was a rabbinic student who went astray or a rabbi who
led his students astray.
 Jesus was tried fairly for blasphemy and idolatry, but no one
came to his defense.
Each of these traditions confronts a gospel claim: that Jesus was
the son of God and son of David, that he was a legitimate healer and
teacher, and that he was arrested and tried hastily and illegally on
trumped-up charges. While these are all late traditions and don’t
tell us much about the historical Jesus, they do tell us a tremen-
dous amount about later historical debates between Jews and
Christians in a region where the playing field was relatively level.
However, the playing field wasn’t level at all in the Christian Byzantine
Empire or in Western Europe. Christians’ horrific treatment of the
Jews over the centuries in the name of Jesus has understandably
shaped Jewish views of the man. His death becomes their death
sentence, or at the very least a license to harass them. The gospels
share the blame for this, even while the authors of some of the
worst passages were most likely Jewish themselves.
For example, the author of Matthew has the Jewish crowd cry to
Pontius Pilate, “His blood be on us and on our children” (Matthew
27:25), and later Christians took that literally, using it to justify
obscene violence against people they labeled “Christ-killers” or dei-
cides (God-killers).
It wasn’t just that “the Jews” were perceived to be guilty of that
past deed; it was also the fact that they weren’t Christian. Their
very existence raised a kind of perpetual question mark over
Christianity, suggesting that Christian beliefs may be wrong, which
is what Christians couldn’t tolerate.
This makes the stakes very high today whenever people take a
look at the gospels’ portraits of Judaism or the quest for the histor-
ical Jesus. There are a lot of places where Christian biases for Jesus
can become prejudices against Judaism. For example, a Christian
who ponders why God sent Jesus might answer that Jesus had to
correct a corrupted Jewish religion or supplement a deficient
Jewish revelation. These interpretations target Jewish belief and
practice as the culprits — the reasons why God intervened. That’s
why it’s so important to reconstruct the Jewish Jesus carefully and
to recognize that Jesus was killed not by “the Jews” as a group, still
less the Jews of all time, but rather by the Roman prefect Pontius
Pilate with the collaboration of a few leading Jewish aristocrats.

Dummies by Ted Falcon and David Blatner (Wiley).

Jesus in Islam
A core belief of Islam is the absolute unity, or tawhid, of Allah
(Allah is the name of God in Islam). While Christians share this
belief, the Christian belief in Jesus as God’s son and the Holy Spirit
as the third member of the Trinity strikes a Muslim’s ear as shirk (a
violation of tawhid). So, the surahs (chapters) of the Qur’an consis-
tently refer to Jesus as “son of Mary” rather than the “son of God”
epithet usually found in Christian creeds.
Given the Muslim’s view of Jesus, it’s interesting that the Qur’an
preserves the tradition that Jesus was a great miracle worker. After
all, in Christian belief Jesus’s status as a miracle worker is taken as
proof of his divine connections. Surah 5:110 is an example of Jesus’s
miracle working. It tells the story of Jesus making birds out of clay
and breathing life into them, which mirrors a tale told among
Christians in the apocryphal Arabic Infancy Gospel (see Chapter 9).
Even more interesting is the Qur’anic view of Jesus’s crucifixion in
surah 4:157–158. In this passage, Jesus isn’t actually crucified and
therefore doesn’t die: “They did not kill him, nor did they crucify
him, but it was made to appear so” to the onlookers. Allah raises
Jesus up to himself without allowing Jesus to suffer anything. His
exemption from suffering and death makes sense in the Qur’an
because of the strong theme that God never abandons his prophets
to such a fate.
Some Christians at the time were saying something similar — that
Jesus didn’t die on the cross — but unlike the Qur’an, they were also
saying that he couldn’t die because he wasn’t really human to begin
with. These folks were called Docetists, and they thought that Jesus
was completely divine (I discuss them in Chapter 15). Within the
Muslim faith, that notion would be shirk because Muslims don’t believe
that Jesus was divine at all, nor do they believe that Mohammed
(their great prophet to whom the Qur’an was revealed) picked up
stories like this from other people like the Docetists. Instead, they
believe that the words of the Qur’an came directly from Allah.
Muslims recognize Jesus as a prophet and as one of the most impor-
tant messengers of Allah. They believe in Jesus’s importance because
he had an authentic scriptural revelation (the Injil, or gospel, from
the Greek euangelion) and because he had not only an audience but
also an enduring community of followers (as did Abraham, Moses,
and Mohammed). However, a final prophet was needed to clarify the
revelation, as the Qur’an claims the Torah and gospel predict (Qur’an
7:157; Muslim commentators gloss this verse by pointing to the
“prophet like Moses” promised after Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15
and the advocate that Jesus promises will follow him in John 14:16).
Muslims believe that Mohammed was that final prophet and (through
Chapter 16: A Western Savior Goes Global 271

the Qur’anic revelations) that he set right the distortions that people
had introduced to Jesus’s message.

Islam For Dummies by Malcolm Clark (Wiley).
Jesus in Eastern religions
Hinduism is one of the oldest of the major world religious tradi-
tions, predating Christianity by several centuries. As Hindus
encountered Christian missionaries in India in recent centuries,
two notions about Jesus cropped up. They said that
 Jesus was one of many incarnations (avatars) of God, particularly
Vishnu, who would regularly revisit earth in one form or another
to reinvigorate Hindu teaching.
 Jesus had spent time in India himself (those hidden years
mentioned in Chapter 9) and received his teaching from Hindu
teachers.
Buddhist views of Jesus are a little less specific and historical than
Hindu traditions. Buddhists, for example, distinguish between
verbal doctrines and intuitive, clear seeing. The verbal doctrines
are methods of delivery, which are more or less useful depending
on the circumstances, while the clear seeing is where truth lies.
Buddhists view the verbal doctrines about Jesus, which are at the
center of Christian creeds and orthodoxy, as having utility but not
truth. According to Buddhists, if these verbal doctrines are blindly
followed or made ends in themselves, they lose their utility
because they no longer deliver a living message.
In a Buddhist’s eyes, Jesus is more like a bodhisattva than the
Buddha because bodhisattvas train ceaselessly in method and
wisdom and make any sacrifices necessary for the sake of others’
spiritual progress. They aspire to complete Buddhahood and dedi-
cate themselves to helping others achieve it, too. Jesus’s behavior
looks like that to many Buddhists. Buddhists wouldn’t be inclined to
view Jesus as a Buddha himself, though — as one who is capable of
perfect compassion and wisdom — because they would not want to
grant a major figure in another religion the status of their ultimate
authority figures (a tendency in most religions!).

In This Chapter
 Tracing the earliest images of Jesus
 Tracking trends from the Middle Ages to the Enlightenment
 Exposing the impact of modern portraits
T
he Christian belief that God became human through Jesus gave
artists permission to depict the divine. In fact, to Christians,
the age-old commandment against creating images of God (Exodus
20:4–6) seemed to have been broken by God when Christ became
subject to the limitations of human word and human flesh. Artists
rose to the challenge of depicting the human and divine nature of
Jesus. They shaped belief and practice even while belief and practice
shaped them. These artists produced so many works that it’s some-
times difficult to understand Western and Byzantine art if you don’t
know anything about Jesus. (Byzantine art is the art of the eastern
Roman or Byzantine Empire, 330–1461 CE.) But never fear, I explain
all that you need to know. In this chapter, you see why early Christians
wanted images of Christ, you discover how they reshaped their ideal
man over the centuries, and you meet some of the modern faces of
Christ in art.
Exploring Early Images of Jesus
Today we have no surviving portraits of Jesus of Nazareth. No one
thought to draw or paint his face or body during his life or in the
decades after his death — and if they did, those paintings or
drawings haven’t survived.
After his death and as belief in Jesus grew and devotion to him
expanded, the desire to see and touch Christ increased. And
because the gospels didn’t even describe him, early Christian
imagination had to fill the gap. Christian writers thought that Jesus

must have been ugly because they were so convinced that Isaiah
53 prophesied their suffering messiah (“He had no form or beauty
that we should look at him, and no appearance that we should find
him pleasing,” Isaiah 53:2–3). But Christian artists tended to depict
him more favorably. In the following sections, I introduce you to
the first images produced by these early Christians.
Depicting Jesus in wall art
Some of the earliest images of Jesus aren’t really portraits. Instead,
they’re symbols that were scratched into or painted on walls in
places like Rome and Carthage, North Africa (see the nearby side-
bar, “What’s in a name? Christograms,” for more about symbols).
These images of things such as anchors, doves, palm or olive
branches, and fish were associated with Jesus’s ministry and his
victory (life over death), and they provided early, simple graphics
that gave Christians an idea of who Jesus was.
In addition to simple graphics, more elaborate images called fres-
coes, which were painted in wet plaster in the Roman catacombs,
offer the first representations of gospel stories and interpretations
of the Jewish scriptures in light of Jesus.
Connecting Jesus to an unusual symbol
An early graffito (a drawing or writing scratched into a wall) from a
guard room in the imperial palace on the Palatine Hill in Rome around
200 CE showed a man worshipping a crucified, donkey-headed figure.
The inscription said, “Alexamenos worships his god.”
This graffito was most likely the work of a pagan soldier mocking
Christians, but the choice of the donkey isn’t entirely his. Christians
themselves used the donkey (of all creatures!) as a symbol of their
humble God. Whether depicting his birth in a stable or showing him
entering Jerusalem, the donkey (rather than the lion, eagle, stag, or
bull) was Jesus’s mount. And in some images, the donkey appears
alone with the inscription, “Our Lord, Jesus Christ, son of God.”
How did the donkey become a symbol associated with Jesus? Early
Christians tied Jesus to passages in the Jewish scriptures in which
the pagan prophet Balaam’s donkey recognized a divine messenger
standing in the road in front of him and stopped dead in his tracks.
After beating the poor beast, Balaam finally saw the angel, too.
This prompted Balaam to utter a messianic blessing on Israel
(Numbers 22:22–35). In the same way, the Christians (who were fre-
quently humbled and mocked by the powerful pagans of their day
for worshipping a crucified criminal as God) felt vindicated for rec-
ognizing God’s messiah. The donkey was thus a symbol of them
and of Christ as well as a symbol of their hope that one day the
rest of the pagans would see things as they did, just as Balaam had.

What’s in a name? Christograms
Despite how it sounds, the term “Christogram” doesn’t refer to an Internet prayer
chain or a holy man showing up on your birthday to sing you a hymn. On the con-
trary, these are symbols used to designate Christ’s name. Here’s a list of the most
common symbols:
 Staurogram: This symbol is a Latin cross with a looped top. According to
Lactantius (a Christian teacher of rhetoric and tutor for Constantine’s son
Crispus), this was the sign that Constantine fought under (On the Deaths of the
Persecutors 44.5).
 Chi-Rho: This Christogram was named for the first two Greek letters of the name
“Christ.” According to Eusebius, this is the sign that Constantine put on his flag
(Life of Constantine 28–31).
 An “X”: Contrary to popular belief, the “X” in “Xmas” isn’t crossing out Christ;
it’s simply shortening his title to its first letter.
 Acronym of Jesus’s name in Greek: Eastern Christians lengthened the abbre-
viation of the name “Christ” (see the previous Christograms) by combining the
first and last letters each of “Jesus” and “Christ.” Sometimes a line is drawn
over each pair to make the acronym clear.
 The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet: The alpha and the omega sym-
bolize how Christ is the origin (John 1:1–3) and goal of creation (Revelation
19–22). In the Book of Revelation, Jesus is actually called “the Alpha and the
Omega” (Revelation 1:8; 21:6; 22:13).
 The first three letters of Jesus’s name in Greek: The second letter is an eta (a
Greek letter with a long “a” sound), but it’s transliterated with the Latin “H.” The
use of the “H” in the trio of letters led to some backronyms (new meanings for
old acronyms) over the years. Some of these backronyms include Constantine’s
In Hoc Signo (“In this sign [conquer]”), Iesus Hominum Salvator (“Jesus, Savior
of men,”), and the Jesuits Catholic religious order, Iesum Habemus Socium (“We
have Jesus for our companion”).

Seeing salvation in catacombs
In the mid-third century, Roman Christians began burying their dead
in underground chambers, called catacombs, outside of Rome (they
didn’t follow the custom of cremation because they believed in
bodily resurrection). Forty such catacombs have been discovered.
Many of them preserve frescoes that include the image of Jesus.
The most common scenes in these catacomb frescoes are the mira-
cles of Jesus, such as turning water into wine at Cana (John 2),
multiplying the loaves and fishes (Mark 6:34–44; 8:1–9), and the
raising of the dead (Luke 7:11–17; John 11:1–44). They depict
Jesus’s power over nature, life, and death — talk about an impor-
tant and appropriate theme in a burial chamber!
Another common theme in these Roman catacombs is the power of
Christian faith over pagan belief. This power is often depicted by
the visit of the wise men or Magi (Matthew 2:1–12; see Chapter 9).
In Matthew’s gospel, they’re the pagan guys who travel all the way
to Judea from “the east” (probably Babylon) to pay homage to the
“King of the Jews,” Jesus.
Making a case for Jesus by adapting
pagan art
Many early Christian images of Jesus grew out of the culture wars
of the Roman Empire in 200–400 CE. Among other things, these
images gave artists a chance to indicate:
 How Jesus was divine and human (see Chapter 15 for more
about the Christological controversies)
 Which god or gods they found most compelling
 How loyal they were to God versus the Roman emperor
You can think of these Christian images as a kind of marketing cam-
paign. What they were trying to do was make a case for Christ — a
case that in the end was remarkably successful.
Touching the sick with healing hands
Among the earliest motifs in the art of Christ were pictures of his
healings. These pictures of Jesus touching the sick with his hand or
wand surrounded stone caskets carved for the wealthy. They clearly
hoped that the healer of others could raise them to eternal life.
The wizard wand that Jesus used predates Harry Potter by a couple
of millennia. In fact, you start to see it in the hands of sorcerers in
Part V: Experiencing Christ in Culture 
276

the art of Egypt 2,000 years before Christ. The Jews had long claimed
that their leaders were more powerful than the pagan magicians
(see Exodus 5–12; 1 Kings 18; Daniel 1:19–20; 2:24–28; 4:18–19;
5:7–12). Christians took up this belief, offering people a God who
was not only more powerful than their gods but who also cared
about their every ailment. Not even the great Greek healing god
Asclepius was portrayed touching the ill like Jesus was.
Favoring androgyny
A striking feature of Christian art is the androgynous (both male
and female) image favored for Christ. In early art, Jesus is often
portrayed as cleanshaven and youthful, but he also often has wide
hips, long hair, and breasts. Some of these same portraits (the sixth
century Arian baptistery in Ravenna, for example) also show the
naked Christ with male genitalia. So it’s clear that he isn’t a woman
but is instead more of a hermaphrodite. This idea may go back to a
first-century belief that in Christ “there is neither male nor female”
(Galatians 3:28) because Christ restored people to what humans
were originally meant to be (Genesis 1:26–27).
These effeminate portraits of Jesus echo and contrast the images
of other gods. For instance:
 Apollo was also portrayed with breasts, long hair, and a boyish
form to emphasize his fruitfulness and fertility. Transfer these
effeminate features to Christ, and he becomes the new source
of fertility. By giving Jesus feminine features, the artists make
Jesus powerful and the Roman gods impotent at the same time.
 A youthful Jesus holding a lamb takes the place of the buff,
naked Hercules, who’s holding the skin of the Nemean lion. The
great labors of Hercules look pretty feeble if a little shepherd
boy can outdo him. (Figure 17-1 shows Jesus as a shepherd.)
Not all the images of Jesus are effeminate. He’s also often pictured
with the manly features of Jupiter, the king of the gods: dark hair
and beard, a broad forehead, and a halo of light around his face.
He’s also often sitting on a high-backed throne. The artist is assert-
ing that Jesus has taken over Jupiter’s role.
Dressing Jesus in the emperor’s clothes
In the fourth century, Roman emperors patronized Christianity and
often portrayed themselves alongside Christ. This imperial sponsor-
ship of Christianity altered the nature of Christian art. The art
could now be public and monumental — it no longer had to be
hidden in catacombs (as I describe earlier in this chapter).
Chapter 17: From Graffiti to the Guggenheim: Jesus in Art 277

Figure 17-1: Jesus as the Good Shepherd from a mosaic at the Basilica of
Aquileia in Italy.
It’s customary to assume that the roles of Christ and emperor fused
from this point on. The conventional wisdom is that Jesus began to
be portrayed as a kind of cosmic king who authorized the rule of
emperors. One popular example of the cosmic king image was the
Pantocrator (“ruler of all”), found in paintings, mosaics, sculpture,
and illuminated manuscripts of the Bible (see Figure 17-2).
At the same time, however, some Christian artists undermined
imperial imagery. For example:
 They painted Jesus in a philosopher’s toga with a scroll in his
hand (rather than in military garb with a weapon in hand).
 They presented Jesus entering Jerusalem sidesaddle on a
donkey rather than astride a horse like an emperor.
 They depicted him as cleanshaven with long hair even though
emperors typically were represented with a beard and short hair.
It’s easy enough to see how the imperial presentation of Jesus was a
good marketing move for an imperial patron. It identifies the ruler
with divine power, almost authorizing his rule. So why did some
people paint other very un-imperial images of Jesus — images that
Part V: Experiencing Christ in Culture 
278

actively toyed with imperial trappings? Perhaps to keep their
rulers humble (they weren’t God, after all!) and to remind them that
they, too, would be judged by a king with very different values.
Figure 17-2: A bust of Christ, ruler of all, from Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.
Praying with icons
In the mid-100s CE, Christians began to take over the icon art form
from the Egyptians and Romans. An Egyptian and Roman icon was
a portrait of a god painted on a panel of wood that was set up in
temples or domestic shrines. The Christian icon, which depicted a
divine or saintly figure or a biblical scene, was painted in the same
manner, and was hung at first in homes and later in churches.
At first, many Christians found it controversial to borrow this pagan
art form. After all, icons were idolatrous and were used at home
where bishops couldn’t control them. Also, these Christians thought
that an icon could easily become a fetish, which is an item that’s
accorded power in itself, rather than a prayer aid. These concerns
regarding the icon resurfaced in the Byzantine Empire during the
700s and 800s CE and in the Reformation in Europe during the 1500s
CE. Despite the concerns, the Christian icon has survived, particu-
larly in Eastern Orthodox Christianity, as one of the most important
genres of devotional art.

Changing Images of Christ 
through the Ages
The figure of Christ portrayed in art represents the ideals of the
artists and their patrons. So as cultural ideals shifted throughout
history, so too did the portraits of Christ.
Desiring images directly from Jesus
In the late fourth century, and continuing into the Middle Ages, a spe-
cial set of Jesus images surfaced. These images were impressions of
his face or body that people thought Jesus himself had made. These
impressions, called “true images” by some people, upstaged other
icons because they were thought to come directly from God:
 The Mandylion of Edessa: The Mandylion was a cloth that
was supposedly sent by Jesus himself to King Abgar of Edessa
(located in southeastern Turkey, in the old Roman province of
Mesopotamia). Miracles were attributed to this cloth, includ-
ing the healing of Abgar himself, so it became a revered icon
in the East and the West. Word of it began to circulate in the
late fourth century, but the image has since been lost.
 The Veronica: The Veronica was originally thought to be a
self-portrait that Jesus had allegedly given to the woman he
cured of a hemorrhage (Mark 5:25–34). The woman’s name,
Berenike (Veronica in Latin), was transferred to the image (the
name may have also come from vera icon, or “true image”).
The portrait emerged in Rome in the 12th century, and pil-
grims came by the thousands to see it. Within a century, the
story had changed: A woman named Veronica actually wiped
Jesus’s bloodied face with a cloth as he carried his cross to
Golgotha, and later she found his face imprinted on it. The flu-
idity of the story and the rather late appearance of the relic
lead historians to believe that it isn’t actually a “true image.”
 The Shroud of Turin: The Shroud of Turin is the reputed
burial cloth of Jesus that bears an image of a crucified man.
The cloth first emerged in 1357. Like the Veronica, the late
appearance of the relic as well as the results of scientific test-
ing lead many historians to the conclusion that the Shroud of
Turin isn’t authentic (see Chapter 5).
The ongoing popularity of the Shroud of Turin and the Veronica in
Western devotional practice attests to the dual desires to touch
both an image of Christ and his suffering.

280

Emphasizing Jesus’s suffering
Jesus’s death on the cross is one of the most familiar artistic
expressions in Christian art, but it wasn’t always so popular. In
fact, it was one of the last images to catch on. This is because the
earliest Christians, often victims of persecution themselves, pre-
ferred to emphasize Jesus’s power and triumph rather than his tor-
tured death (I discuss early images of Jesus earlier in this chapter).
This preference began to change in the 1200s CE. The Cistercian
monk Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153 CE) and the friar Francis of
Assisi (1182–1226 CE) laid the groundwork for this change by
emphasizing the humanity and suffering of Christ. They urged a
kind of affective spirituality to evoke human compassion for Jesus.
Their work caused the following vignettes of Jesus’s suffering to
become an integral part of Christian art up to the present day:
 The scourging, mocking, and crowning with thorns (Mark
14:65; 15:15–20); an example is Hieronymus Bosch, The
Crowning with Thorns, 1490–1500.
 The Ecce Homo scene (Latin for “behold the man”), when
Pontius Pilate presents the scourged Jesus to the crowd (John
19:5); an example is Correggio, Christ presented to the People
(Ecce Homo), 1525–1530.
 The way of the cross, or Jesus’s walk to the place of crucifix-
ion (Luke 23:26–31; see Chapters 14 and 20); an example is
Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, The Procession to Calvary, 1505.
 The crucifixion (Matthew 27:32–55 and Luke 23:32–49); an
example is Anonymous, Crucifixion window, the cathedral of
Notre Dame de Chartres, 12th century.
 The deposition of Jesus’s body from the cross (Mark 15:46);
an example is Unknown French master, The Deposition (ivory,
the Louvre), 1300.
 The Pietà, when Jesus’s dead body is placed in his mother
Mary’s arms (not narrated in scripture, but based on Mary’s
presence at the foot of the cross in John 19:25–27). Perhaps
the most famous Pietà is Michelangelo’s in St. Peter’s Basilica
in Vatican City (1498–1499). Mary’s sorrow is the focus of a key
image in Spanish art, the Mater Dolorosa (mother of sorrows).
 The group lamentation over the dead Jesus, which is an
expansion on scripture. See Figure 17-3, where Andrea
Mantegna portrays Jesus’s human flesh from the angle of his
lowly feet in The Lamentation over the Dead Christ, c. 1490.
 The entombment (Mark 15:40–47); an example is Masters of
Dirc van Delf, The Entombment (illuminated manuscript, the
Getty), 1405–1410.
Chapter 17: From Graffiti to the Guggenheim: Jesus in Art 281

(c. 1490).
Focusing on divine love
Many images of Jesus emphasize the beauty of his body in art that
evokes love rather than pity. This emphasis is especially promi-
nent in the graceful Renaissance nudes of the baptism, crucifixion,
and resurrection scenes painted from the 1400s to the 1600s.
For example, in one painting by Titian called Noli me Tangere,
1510–1515 (see Figure 17-4), Jesus delicately avoids Mary Magdalene’s
touch (John 20:11–18). In another, he offers body and blood for the
nourishment of believers (Mark 14:17–31; an example is Giovanni
Bellini, The Blood of the Redeemer, 1460–1465). Such images aren’t
erotic or cannibalistic. Instead, they offer Jesus as the only object of
love that can truly satisfy the human spirit. As the North African
Bishop Augustine said (in his autobiographical book Confessions 1.1,
c. 397–398 CE), “You have made us for yourself, O God, and our
hearts are restless until they rest in You.”

Depicting Jesus as philosopher
and poet
The Enlightenment preferences for reason and science spawned
the quest for the historical Jesus (see Chapter 4) and, in the 17th
and 18th centuries, prompted artists to portray Jesus as a some-
what passionless philosopher. Many in this era could no longer
accept that Jesus was divine and performed miracles. So, they took
what was left — Jesus’s teachings — and painted their portraits
from that. Jesus became a kind of super-Socrates — a teacher of
universal truth and morals. Favorite scenes from his life include
the child Jesus teaching the teachers in the Jerusalem Temple
(Luke 2:46–50) and the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7).
This, in turn, prompted a romantic reaction in the 19th century,
when artists tried to capture the mystery of Jesus’s divinity in
terms that modern minds could grasp. That means that the artists
wouldn’t focus on miracles. Instead, romantic paintings often por-
tray Jesus at moments of doubt, struggle, or personal reflection,
such as the temptations in the wilderness (Luke 4:1–13) or the

agony in the garden (Mark 14:32–42; an example is Heinrich
Hofmann’s Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, 1890). Jesus was
depicted as an inspiring spirit whose integrity and authenticity,
even in the face of temptation and death, were what made him
divine. He was seen as the ideal human, the model of what every-
one might be.
Updating Appearances in the Last
Century
In more recent art (1900 to today), the Christs of earlier centuries
who brought coherence to whole cultures have shattered into frag-
ments that no longer offer a common hero or God.
Restoring the Jewish Jesus
The persecution of Jews culminating in the Holocaust in Europe
(1938–1945) prompted an artistic response. For example, Marc
Chagall, the Russian Jewish painter (1887–1985), composed White
Crucifixion in 1938. In this painting, Chagall portrayed a Jewish
Jesus who was wrapped in a Jewish prayer shawl, crucified on the
cross, and surrounded by various scenes of terror. The sufferings
of later Jews surrounding him are identified with the sufferings of
Jesus, the one Jew in whose name so much of the violence was
produced. A painting like this isn’t a statement of Christian faith, of
course; instead it’s a prophetic challenge to empathy and identifi-
cation and a prophetic indictment of religious violence.
Mobilizing believers in times of crisis
The power of Christian imagery was weakened during the
Enlightenment and its aftermath, but it could still serve to mobilize
sentiment in times of national crisis. For example, in Warner
Sallman’s World War II propaganda poster, The Christmas Story
(part of his “War Cry” series of 1942), an American GI is reading his
New Testament in a beam of heavenly light that passes through the
scene of the Christmas crèche. The “War Cry” here isn’t violent or
bloodthirsty. The American war effort is instead cloaked in the
values of humility and peace that the crèche evokes.
In the anti-American propaganda poster from occupied France
called Assassin (1943; see Figure 17-5), a terrified European girl is
menaced by a leering, larger-than-life U.S. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt. The girl is aligned with the cross as she looks to the
heavens for salvation from American evil.

Portraying a distant God
The skepticism of the 19th century and the horrors of the 20th cen-
tury led many artists to despair both of God and humans. For
those who still believed in Christianity, obstacles to faith remained.
The following pieces were created during this dark time:
 Holman Hunt’s The Light of the World (1900–1904): This
painting depicts Jesus knocking on a door in the dead of night.
The garden is filled with weeds and the door is bound shut with
vines. Like Siegfried Reinhardt’s Light (1959), which depicts
Christ enlightening the scene but surrounded by people who
are oblivious to him, Christ is still present, but the world
remains locked in darkness or preoccupied with other things.
 Salvador Dalí’s Christ of Saint John of the Cross (1951):
This painting was Dalí’s response to the bombing of Hiroshima
in 1945. In the painting, you’re looking down on a monumental
crucified Christ who’s suspended in the heavens and who’s
looking down on the world. With arms outstretched on the
cross, he embraces a fragile world. This is a beautiful,
transcendent, and mystical Christ who’s near and yet far.

Globalizing the image gallery
People around the globe have remade the image of Christ into one
they recognize. He takes the face of those who believe in him. For
example, consider the following global images:
 U.S. artist DeVon Cunningham’s Black Christ, in the apse dome
of St. Cecilia Catholic Church in inner-city Detroit, surrounded
by figures from all races and religions (1968)
 U.S. artist Janet McKenzie’s Jesus of the People, which depicts
an androgynous African Jesus with Native American and
Eastern symbols (2000)
 Monika Liu Ho-Peh’s Chinese Christ in The Stilling of the
Tempest (c. 1950s)
 Australian aboriginal Miriam Rose Ungunmerr-Baumann’s
abstract Stations of the Cross
 The Nicaraguan images of Christ raising the murdered peasants
of Solentiname
Picturing a Palestinian Jew
An interesting image of Jesus was recreated in 2002 through a
combination of forensic anthropology, computer imaging, and old-
fashioned painting. Medical artist Richard Neave reconstructed the
facial features of a first-century Palestinian skull for a BBC and CNN
television special and turned the computer images over to a painter.
The final result, titled 1st Century Semitic Man by Donato Giancola,
presents an image of a typical man in Jesus’s world.
Giancola’s image of Jesus is quite a contrast to the fair-skinned,
slender-nosed, long-haired Jesus typical of Western art. (For an
example of the more fair-skinned Jesus, see the chiseled features of
Bartolomeo Pinelli’s Head of Christ in Figure 17-6.) Giancola’s por-
trait shows the impact of the quest for a more historical Jesus on
the conventions of Christian art. The pale skin, delicate bone struc-
ture, and straight hair of the idealized European man are gone. In
its place is a portrait based on archaeological evidence that pres-
ents a more plausible face for a first-century Jewish man.

In This Chapter
 Understanding the factors involved in making films about Jesus
 Exploring Jesus in silent, epic, musical, scandal, and classic films
H
ollywood gets a lot of bad press from some Christians (like
the hoopla about the film The Da Vinci Code in 2006). So, you
may be surprised to find out that films about Jesus have been a
staple of cinema since film’s earliest days. Over the past 110-plus
years, more than 120 movies have been made about Jesus’s life,
with countless other films modeling their protagonists on Christlike
figures (for example, Denys Arcand’s Jésus de Montréal, 1989).
One of the reasons for the popularity of Jesus films is that the story
has a guaranteed audience. Even though directors have difficulty
appealing to everyone in that audience, the sheer interest in
Christianity has led many a producer to cough up the cash. The
commercial success of Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ (2004)
has only reinforced this tendency.
In this chapter, you explore filmmakers’ first attempts to make Jesus
movies, you find out how the genre expanded into epic form in the
1950s and 1960s, and you discover the more recent films that scan-
dalized and inspired audiences.
You can look up information about films mentioned in this chapter
at The Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com).
Getting from the Gospels
to the Big Screen
People have been imagining, writing, and acting out the gospel sto-
ries since the days of the first preachers. By 1895, when Auguste
and Louis Lumière showed the first public movie in the basement
of the Grand Café in Paris, a filmmaker aspiring to tell the tale of
Jesus had a lot to play with and a lot of choices to make.

Setting the stage
Dramatic performances of Jesus’s life date at least to the Middle
Ages, when a humanistic impulse inspired all kinds of affective
interest in Jesus’s human life and suffering. People wanted to feel
Jesus’s suffering on the cross, so they mimed his final steps to
Golgotha on the anniversary of his death and popularized the cru-
cifix (the cross with Jesus’s body on it). In medieval art, there was
an explosion of interest in images of Jesus’s birth in a stable and
his death on the cross. (See Chapters 16 and 17 and the nearby
sidebar, “The play’s the thing: Jesus in theater,” for more details.)
The tradition continued with the actors and acrobats of the traveling
circuses in 19th- and 20th-century England and America. These folks
traveled all over while performing spectacles from the Bible and from
history in their stunning opening-night extravaganzas. They didn’t act
out the life and death of Jesus, though — even with the resurrection,
that wouldn’t have made for a very fun opening night at the circus.
Instead, circuses like Ringling Brothers produced elaborate plays
about Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, the fall of Babylon, and
Jerusalem and the Crusades. The sheer spectacle of these perform-
ances certainly influenced the elaborate stagings of later directors,
such as Cecil B. DeMille (see the later section, “Watching the silent
Part V: Experiencing Christ in Culture 
290
The play’s the thing: Jesus in theater
In the Middle Ages, Lenten processions blossomed into full-blown passion plays
that dramatized the suffering and death of Jesus. The first passion play was staged
in Montecassino, Italy, in the 1100s. Other well-known performances were embed-
ded in the great 14th century mystery cycles (sets of 24 to 48 pageants, or scenes,
from the Bible performed over the course of one or more days) in Britain and the
passion plays in Bavaria. In fact, the Bavarian town of Oberammergau has been
producing a passion play every ten years or so since 1633. The early passion plays
often used a variety of special effects to make the passion realistic, including hidden
animal bladders filled with blood that could be squirted out at the appropriate
moments. These plays also featured the Jews (rather than the Romans) as Jesus’s
executioners, which often tragically kindled anti-Jewish violence after the per-
formances were over.
Today, the passion play is still a feature of Holy Week (the week before Easter in the
Christian calendar when Jesus’s death and resurrection are celebrated). Examples of
contemporary passion plays include the Philippine Payson, the Mexican
Representacion de la Pasion,the Brazilian Paixão de Cristo,and the Dutch Passiespelen.
There are also various versions in Australia, the United States, and Canada.

spectacles,” for more information regarding DeMille). How? The
exotic animals, the resplendent costumes, the abundance of
actors, the special effects, and the catastrophic nature of the plots
had become familiar to generations of circusgoers. So, people
expected their public entertainment to be at least that good, and if
movies were going to succeed, they couldn’t afford to disappoint.
Considering different factors when
telling the story of Jesus in film
The gospels don’t make for very good screenplays. They’re
episodic, which means that they move from scene to scene without
a lot of plot development or clues about the characters’ motiva-
tions. Also unhelpful is the fact that whole parts of the story are
often missing, and where the gospels overlap, they often differ.
(Find out more about the gospels in Chapter 2.)
So, if a filmmaker wants to create a feature-length movie out of
these texts, she has to decide whether she’ll use one gospel or a
harmonized version of all of them. She also has to decide whether
to supplement the gospels with outside sources, such as the apoc-
ryphal Christian gospels (see Chapter 5) or scenes from 2,000
years of Christian art (see Chapters 16 and 17).
After deciding on the material she’ll use, a filmmaker then has to
determine which art forms and techniques she’ll need. Cinema
directors use many of the traditional arts, including the following:
 Drama (in the characterizations, plot, and editing)
 Literature (in the scriptwriting and source material)
 Music (in the soundtrack)
 Painting (in scene design and composition, perspective,
camera angle, and zoom)
Each of these elements, plus the moving quality of the medium,
presents a range of choices to the director. For example, certain
important scenes like the removal of Jesus’s body from the cross
might include actionless frames that mimic the composition of
famous still paintings, as Nicolas Ray’s 1961 movie King of Kings
mimics the pietà (the dead Jesus in Mary’s arms; I discuss this film
later in the chapter), or as John T. Coyle and Irving Pichel’s 1954
Jesus character in Day of Triumph mimics a painting of Jesus by
Louis Jambor (see Figure 18-1). Mel Gibson chose to incorporate a
lot of apocryphal material about the Veronica and the tortures of
Jesus from a 19th century woman’s meditations to supplement the
gospel accounts in his 2004 movie, The Passion of the Christ (you
can read more about this film later in the chapter).
Chapter 18: The Reel Jesus 291

Figure 18-1: An actor in the movie Day of Triumph is made up based on Louis
Jambor’s portrait Jesus of Nazareth.
A director’s beliefs about Jesus also impacts his movie. For example,
if he believes that the gospels are literally true, he may present them
differently than a director who’s an atheist. However, movies have to
pay for themselves and turn a profit, so the filmmaker must play to
the sensibilities of the viewers as well. For example, Gibson’s The
Passion of the Christ caught so much flack in prescreenings for its
anti-Jewish features that some of them were removed from the final
cut, such as when the Jewish crowd cries out “His blood be on us
and on our children!” from Matthew 27:25 (the crowd still shouts it
in Aramaic, but the English subtitle was removed).
Screening the Savior
Movies about Jesus span a huge range when it comes to length,
format, and tone. They range from a few minutes to several hours,
from silent movies to musicals, and from the ridiculous to the
sublime.

Watching the silent spectacles
The period of silent films from 1895 until the debut of talking pic-
tures in 1927 produced more than 15 Jesus films. The first was a
five-minute film produced in Paris titled Léar Passion, or The
Passion of Christ (1897). Unfortunately, no copies of it survive.
The silent films that followed also focused on the passion, but many
of these tried to reproduce passion plays from particular parts of
the world, such as The Horitz Passion Play (1897) and The Mystery of
the Passion Play of Oberammergau (1898), which was ironically shot
on the roof of Manhattan’s Grand Central Palace Hotel.
The following films, which were all produced in the United States,
are the longest and most significant of the silent Jesus films:
 From the Manger to the Cross (1912): This film, directed by
Sidney Olcott, ran 60 minutes, which was fairly long consider-
ing the year that it was released. Unlike the earlier silent films,
this one took Jesus from the cradle to the grave, as you might
suspect from the title. In this way, it was more like the gospels
than the medieval passion plays (which mostly focused on the
passion). It was also one of the first films shot on location in
Egypt and Palestine.
 Intolerance (1916): This three-and-a-half-hour epic directed
by D. W. Griffith includes the story of Christ as only one of
four interwoven plots about human cruelty and intolerance.
Intolerance still ranks as one of the most ambitious Jesus films
for its sheer scope and spectacle (it includes a Fall of Babylon
more spectacular than the 19th century circuses could ever
stage). Through analogy, Griffith likens the Pharisees of
Jesus’s day to the prohibitionists of his own time.
 The King of Kings (1927): This colossal film directed by Cecil
B. DeMille opens with a memorable scene of the prostitute
Mary Magdalene entertaining her clients amid tigers and fan-
wielding slaves and then leaping onto her zebra-driven char-
iot to confront the man who has “stolen” Judas from her
(Judas was her only attractive customer in DeMille’s telling).
The moment she sees Jesus, seven demons (the seven deadly
sins) emerge from her and evaporate (the only part of this
that’s remotely Biblical is the reference to seven demons quit-
ting her; see Luke 8:2). This exorcism leaves her calm and in
search of a little more clothing. Mary isn’t a prostitute in the
gospels, but in the Jesus films she usually is (see Chapter 10
for more on Mary).
After Mary’s grand entrance, this two-hour silent film covers
the adult life of Jesus in a reverential way, accompanied by
stills of Biblical quotations and religious music. The crucifixion
Chapter 18: The Reel Jesus 293

scene is filmed from a great distance (called long shot) with a
massive crowd and little movement, almost like a classical
painting by Gustave Doré or Rubens (DeMille consciously imi-
tated some 300 famous paintings in his scene compositions).
The film was immensely successful, partly because DeMille
worked hard during filming to placate potential critics by
employing religious advisors and praying on set.
Painting Jesus on an epic scale
Cecil B. DeMille’s The King of Kings was so wildly popular and so
widely seen that few filmmakers attempted another Jesus film for a
couple of decades. There were, however, several films in which
Jesus was an important prop, but he was hardly shown. These
films include Quo Vadis (1951), The Robe (1953), Ben-Hur (1959),
and Barabbas (1962).
DeMille died in 1959, and with his passing a new generation of film-
makers was emboldened to step into the Jesus genre once again.
At that time, new inventions in sound and film technology offered
opportunities to present the story of Jesus in new ways.
So, two epic American films about Jesus were produced in the
1960s. Even though these films — King of Kings (1961) and The
Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) — were not very successful, they’re
still significant because of their sheer scope and their attempts to
break in important ways with the somewhat pious conventions of
the past. A third epic, Jesus of Nazareth (1977), which was made for
television in 1977, fared much better.
King of Kings (1961)
Nicholas Ray (director) and Samuel Bronston (producer) shot King
of Kings in Spain. The movie ran more than three hours long, and
Ray added all sorts of unhistorical material to tie the plot together.
For example, he added the centurion Lucius, who’s present at
Jesus’s birth, youth, childhood, and death. In fact, in the movie,
Lucius even acts as Jesus’s defense attorney!
Ray removed a lot of Jesus’s conflict with Jewish authorities, but
he also took out the prophetic elements that would have made Jesus
seem more Jewish himself. Ray’s Jesus, teen heartthrob Jeffrey Hunter,
was a bit of a distraction, and the reduction of Jesus’s teaching to
the Sermon on the Mount made it tough to see why anyone would
want to kill Jesus. On top of all these complaints, Ray offered very
little of the miraculous or divine, so the movie ended up offending a
lot of Christians.
Part V: Experiencing Christ in Culture 
294

The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965)
George Stevens’ The Greatest Story Ever Told hit theaters in 1965.
With an all-star cast and panoramic scenes shot in Colorado and
Utah (like his classic western, Shane), the film takes the prize for
the most expensive Jesus film ever. It took a whopping $20 million
to produce. But, unfortunately for Stevens, it was also a box office
dud. Critics chalked the failure up to the four-hour-plus length, the
overwhelming scenery and music, and the baggage that the all-star
cast inevitably brought from other movies they had been in.
Jesus of Nazareth (1977)
Franco Zeffirelli’s multipart television miniseries on the life of
Jesus, Jesus of Nazareth, was the most widely marketed Jesus
movie of all time (though John Heyman’s 1979 film Jesus, which
was promoted internationally by Campus Crusade for Christ, may
give it a run for the money).
Zeffirelli drew his Jesus from all four gospels, so this savior was
immediately familiar to the audience. The film was also notable for
its positive presentation of Judaism. Zeffirelli wanted to teach his
audience. He wanted to use the character of Jesus to remind them
of core values, but he wanted to do this without provoking or alien-
ating his audience too much. So, Zeffirelli’s Jesus isn’t so transcen-
dent as to be mysterious, nor is he so radical as to be irritating.
He’s kind of middle-of-the-road. The film avoids the sentimentality
and anachronisms of the other Jesus epics, presenting the first
Jesus who could actually be a first-century Jew.
Viewing the musical Messiah
The youth culture of the 1960s, its appetite for rewriting the rules,
and the arrival of rock spawned two 1960s theatrical musicals
about Jesus’s life. Both were turned into films that were released a
month apart in the 1970s.
Jesus Christ Superstar (1973)
In 1973, Norman Jewison took Jesus Christ Superstar, the Broadway
musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, to the Negev
desert. The movie focused on the passion, much like the earliest
Jesus films. But unlike those films, Superstar highlighted Judas as
Jesus’s antagonist. Some would even say that Judas had the better
part, which helped offset charges that the movie was racist
(Jewison cast an African American Judas against a white Jesus).
The Jesus in this film rarely teaches, never heals, and doesn’t seem
to rise. But, even though a pious Christian can’t find much of the
Christ of faith in this movie, there are a few great songs. The
Chapter 18: The Reel Jesus 295

soundtrack made double what the film made, with classics such as
Mary Magdalene’s “I Don’t Know How to Love Him,” Jesus’s
“Gethsemane,” and Judas’s “Superstar.”
The Jewish leaders in Superstar are presented as cold, calculating,
and completely in charge of Jesus’s execution. In fact, in a trou-
bling historical reversal, the High Priest Caiaphas deliberates
about a “permanent solution” to the Jesus problem in language
that echoes Hitler’s “final solution” to the Jewish problem.
Godspell (1973)
David Greene’s Godspell combined elements of musical comedy,
vaudeville, and puppetry, presenting Jesus and his flower-child fol-
lowers in the familiar setting of New York City. Even though the ele-
ments and setting make the movie sound flaky, it was actually a
pretty close retelling of the gospels of Matthew and Luke, as its title
suggests (after all, its name plays with the word “gospel” as if the
movie is a new one; it isn’t named after Jesus, like so many of the
others). Godspell included more teaching, healing, and discipleship
content than other films that focused on the passion.
The movie painted Jesus as a kind of superstar — he even had
Superman’s “S” stitched on his chest. But this superman was clearly
a clown. And that motif has a long pedigree — starting with Paul
preaching the “foolishness of the cross” (1 Corinthians 1:17–2:16; see
Chapter 15). For all the clowning around, though, Greene’s Jesus casts
a spell over the movie’s cast. And that spell is strong enough to keep
them dancing even after he’s been crucified on a junkyard fence.
Scandalizing audiences
Serious and even pious Jesus movies continued to be made in the
1970s and 1980s, such as Zeffirelli’s Jesus of Nazareth (1977) and
John Krish and Peter Sykes’ Jesus (1979). But a new trend began to
emerge as well in this post–Vietnam, post–Watergate world — one
that challenged Christian authority and piety through humor and
fantasy. The films presented in this section caused quite a stir when
they were released, but for different reasons.
Monty Python’s Life of Brian (1979)
It’s tough to pull off a satirical comedy about the life and death of
Jesus, but Terry Jones and the Monty Python crew managed to do
it with Life of Brian. They skirted potential offensiveness by making
the whole movie a case of mistaken identity (the main character is
Brian Cohen; the real Jesus was born next door). In fact, the film
was actually less a satire about Jesus than a parody of the older
epic Jesus films. But many still perceived it as an attack on Jesus.
Part V: Experiencing Christ in Culture 
296

Life of Brian, produced with some financial backing from ex-Beatle
George Harrison, has some classic scenes, including the following:
 The Sermon on the Mount spoof (Brian hears “Blessed are the
cheese makers” rather than “Blessed are the peacemakers”)
 The final shot of dozens of crucified people singing the ditty,
“Always look on the bright side of life”
The Last Temptation of Christ (1988)
Martin Scorsese’s film, The Last Temptation of Christ, was set for
scandal long before it hit the theaters. Based on a 1955 novel by
Nikos Kazantzakis (which got him excommunicated from the Greek
Orthodox Church), the film is a modern reflection on the human
nature of Jesus. The plot presents Jesus as a neurotic man confused
about his identity and mission, whose last temptation on the cross
was to marry Mary Magdalene and settle down to a normal life.
Unlike more recent films, such as The Da Vinci Code (2006) and the
Discovery Channel’s The Lost Tomb of Jesus (2007), Kazantzakis’s
book and Scorsese’s film never presented the marriage of Jesus
and Mary as historical, but rather as a fantasy sequence. When
combined with Peter Gabriel’s global soundtrack and the most
realistic crucifixion scene to date, that sequence stripped away the
sentimentalized Hollywood conventions and engaged the viewer
with Jesus. The trouble was that a lot of people were already
devoted to a different kind of Christ.
The Passion of the Christ (2004)
Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ is the latest in a series of
movies focusing on the end of Jesus’s life. In the tradition of
medieval passion plays, this newest passion film dramatizes the
pain and suffering of Jesus. Its intent was not only to increase
empathy for Jesus, but also to show how much suffering Jesus
could take. Jesus’s sheer endurance of two hours of torture
revealed his uniqueness, proved his divinity, and communicated
the saving power of his wounds. It also provided a powerful image
of Jesus for communities that had likewise endured great suffering.
Despite its good intentions, this film fits with the other scandal
films — only the scandal it gave was to a different audience. The
film presented itself as the most historical one yet, using Aramaic
and Latin for the dialogue (although the Roman auxiliary troops
surely would have spoken Greek; see Chapter 8). But several of the
scenes aren’t out of the gospels or history at all. Instead, they
come from the writings of a 19th-century mystic, Anne Catherine
Emmerich. And the movie’s presentation of Jewish responsibility
for Jesus’s death — even to the point of having Satan walk among
Chapter 18: The Reel Jesus 297

the Jews — contradicts the best historical reconstructions and
understandably angered many Christians and Jews (see Chapter 14).
The Da Vinci Code (2006)
Ron Howard directed The Da Vinci Code as an adaptation of Dan
Brown’s bestselling novel by the same name. The movie isn’t tech-
nically a Jesus film; it doesn’t attempt to reproduce the life of the
historical Jesus. Instead, it’s a modern tale about a Harvard
University symbologist, Robert Langdon, who stumbles onto the
secret of the “Holy Grail.” With the help of Parisian cryptographer
Sophie Neveu, he discovers that the Grail isn’t the cup from which
Jesus drank wine at the Last Supper. Instead, the true secret of the
grail (spoiler alert — don’t keep reading if you want to be sur-
prised when you read the book!) is that it’s the bloodline of Jesus,
begun in the womb of Jesus’s wife Mary Magdalene and protected
ever since by a secret order called the Priory of Sion against the
murderous intent of Roman Catholic operatives.
The film was scandalous to many Catholics for its negative portrait
of Catholic groups and for the way that it sexualizes Jesus and Mary
Magdalene’s relationship. As for the many historical problems with
this admittedly fictional tale, check out Chapters 5 and 10.
Classic films about Jesus
Every person who’s into Jesus films has his or her own favorites,
but scholars and film critics have identified two particular movies
as the best of breed.
The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964)
Directed by the Italian Communist and homosexual Pier Paolo
Pasolini, The Gospel According to St. Matthew is widely regarded by
religious and secular critics as the best and most poetic of the
Jesus films. Pasolini picked Matthew’s gospel because he found in
it a Jesus who was aggressive, even angry, but nonviolent and revo-
lutionary in his social views and committed to human concerns.
Pasolini shot the film in black and white in the poor villages of
southern Italy with nonprofessional actors, and he used dialogue
exclusively from the gospel of Matthew and the book of Isaiah. He
also edited it so that it had the character of a sacred pageant like
the medieval passion plays. In other words, the film is a sequence
of unrelated scenes that seem less like drama and more like prayer.
The Messiah (1975)
Roberto Rossellini’s neorealist film, The Messiah, which employed
nonprofessional actors, tried to present Jesus’s life in an objective
light. Rossellini wanted to explore Jesus’s particular and enduring
Part V: Experiencing Christ in Culture 
298

wisdom. To do so, he included more of Jesus’s teaching and less of
the miracles and drama. That means the story is episodic, like the
earliest films, with less attention to filling the gaps in the plot.
However this format had the effect of accentuating the blame on
the Jews because they’re the ones who were challenged by the
teaching. Because he was conscious of film’s ability to create spec-
tacles, Rossellini studiously avoided a showy display and favored a
more serene, austere presentation.

attention out for 2,000 years, and you have that much more
room for doctrines to develop and controversies to get cooked up.
In this chapter, I boil all that history down to the most persistent
controversial questions about Jesus, the man from Nazareth.
Did Jesus Exist?
No one seriously doubted whether Jesus existed until the extreme
skeptics of the Enlightenment era in the 17th and 18th centuries.
Taking their cue from the budding recognition that the gospels
were faith statements rather than documentaries, these folks
began to argue that the gospels were outright fabrications.
However, this theory isn’t very plausible for a few reasons, including
these:
 The degree of detail in the gospels and the surprising variation
between them argues for rather than against Jesus’s existence.
In other words, if you’re trying to perpetrate a fraud, you’d
make sure to get your story straight first instead of shooting
yourself in the foot with stories that contradict and confuse.
 In addition to the insider accounts, Jewish and Roman records
are available that mention this man, and they all date to the
first century after Jesus’s death.

 It’s tough to explain the rise of Christianity and the willingness
of those first followers to die for a story they had cooked up.
At the end of the day, more evidence points to Jesus’s existence than
away from it. See Chapter 5 for more about sources that solidify the
case for the existence of Jesus.
Does Archaeology Back Up the
Existence of Jesus?
As you may know, archaeology is often used to support historical
theories. By studying items and reconstructing the contexts that
they came from, experts can often prove, disprove, or reshape the
leading theories. There have been, for instance, many artifacts and
relics associated with Jesus over the centuries — such as relics from
his body (foreskin, umbilical cord), items from his crucifixion (frag-
ments of the true cross or the crown of thorns), “true images” of his
face or body (see Chapters 5 and 17), and inscriptions naming his
contemporaries (Pontius Pilate, the High Priest Caiaphas, or Jesus’s
brother James).
Most of these relics first appear 300 to 1,300 years after Jesus’s
death, raising the obvious question of where they were in the
meantime. Only the Pilate inscription and the Caiaphas ossuary
have been found to be early, legitimate artifacts.
Was Jesus Human?
As the belief in Jesus’s divinity grew, some people couldn’t imagine
that he had ever really been human. In fact, it took Christians 450
years to sort that one out, and there are still differences in belief
about it today (see Chapter 15 for more details). But almost all
Christian churches say that Jesus was and is human and divine
and that neither “nature” compromises the other.
Are the Gospels Reliable?
Christians answer the question of the gospels’ reliability differently,
depending on how they view scripture. If they view the Bible as the
literal and inerrant word of God, they may be more inclined to view
its historical claims as reliable. If they view the Bible as an inspired
text written by human authors, on the other hand, they may be
more inclined to test the reliability of the gospels’ historical claims

304

Chapter 19: Top Ten Historical Controversies about Jesus 305
against archaeological and literary evidence from the time using
the rules of judging history (see Chapter 3).
Was Jesus Jewish or Christian?
Jesus was Jewish. His teaching, his healing activity, and even his
prophetic challenges to tradition place him squarely within the first-
century Jewish world. There were no Christians during his lifetime.
According to the Acts of the Apostles, the earliest followers of Jesus
in Judea and in the Galilee called themselves “Nazoreans” or “The
Way” (Acts 24:5, 14). These followers weren’t called “Christians”
until they became more of a presence in the Greek-speaking cities,
such as Antioch in Syria (Acts 11:26), well after Jesus’s death.
Was Jesus a Political Rebel?
Jesus probably wasn’t a political rebel, at least not at first. If he had
been, Herod Antipas (son of King Herod the Great; see Chapter 7)
would have taken him out a whole lot sooner. But remember that
Jesus preached God’s coming kingdom — and he believed that it
would come quickly. And he even contrasted God’s rule to the
rulers of this world.
So, when Jesus arrived in Jerusalem for that last Passover, it’s highly
likely that some people thought that God would soon act. That’s all
the provocation that Pontius Pilate needed. Despite Jesus’s message
of nonviolence, his authority and his teaching that the end was near
drew crowds and made him politically dangerous.
Was Jesus a Magician?
The tradition that Jesus healed people is central to the gospel mes-
sage (see Chapter 12). In the authors’ eyes, this tradition proved
that divine power was at work in Jesus and that this divine power
was all about restoring those who were broken in the world. How-
ever, throughout the New Testament, there’s a strong condemnation
of miracles for miracles’ sake, of people who just want a big sign,
and of magicians performing acts for money or notoriety instead of
healing others as part of the restoration of the world. The New
Testament calls these people magicians, and so in its own terms
Jesus isn’t a magician (because instead of seeking fame or money
he sought to bring about a different world). But Jesus certainly
would be referred to as one by later detractors who were trying to
paint him as a charlatan.

Who Was Jesus’s Father?
One of the earliest smears against Christians was that Jesus was a
bastard. It pops up in the writings of the second-century Roman
philosopher Celsus and in the Babylonian Talmud compiled by the
Jews in seventh-century Iraq (see Chapters 4 and 16). These books
are far too late to count as historical. Rather, they represent a kind
of counterthrust to long-standing Christian claims of Jesus’s vir-
ginal conception (Matthew 1:18–25; Luke 1:26–38).
The matter can’t be settled by historians one way or the other
because it can’t be demonstrated from evidence. The virginal con-
ception of Jesus is a faith statement that tries to communicate in
first-century terms the belief that God had a direct hand in Jesus’s
existence and that Jesus is from God in a unique way. (See Chapter
15 for more on how the early Church tried to sort out this issue).
Was Jesus Married?
It appears that Jesus was neither a husband nor a father. There’s
simply no evidence in any early Christian, Jewish, or Roman text
that says he married or had children. It wouldn’t challenge the
Christian creed if he had, though (despite what Nikos Kazantzakis
thought in The Last Temptation of Christ and what Dan Brown wrote
in The Da Vinci Code). After all, the Christian belief that God became
human in Jesus is much more startling and fundamental than saying
that, after becoming human, he married and had kids. (See Chapter
10 for the Mary Magdalene angle on this question.)
What Did Jesus Look Like?
I’m sure everybody has their own idea of what Jesus looked like
when he walked the earth. But there are no early portraits or
descriptions. That means that you have to argue from analogy,
gathering evidence from contemporary skeletons, art, and literary
descriptions about what other Palestinian Jews generally looked
like. On the basis of analogy, experts believe that Jesus was proba-
bly short in stature, stocky, and dark skinned, and he likely had
dark, curly black hair and a dark beard.
Western conventions of portraying Jesus as tall, slender, and mus-
cular, with delicate facial features and fair skin and hair, say more
about Western ideals than about what he really may have looked
like. It’s the perennial issue in traditions about Jesus: The image
we have of him is often our own.

Top Ten Pilgrimage Sites
Associated with Jesus
In This Chapter
 Journeying to the sacred spots linked to Jesus’s life
 Retracing Jesus’s final steps in Jerusalem
 Understanding the events behind the sites
E
verybody likes a road trip. What’s not to like? You clear your
schedule, pack your bags, load up on munchies, and hit the
road. In this chapter, you take a special kind of road trip — a virtual
pilgrimage. You visit the most important places associated with
Jesus of Nazareth.
Every religion has its sacred places, those bits of earthly real estate
where holy events have happened. Most of the sites mentioned in
this chapter can’t be traced back to the historical Jesus, but they
come about as close as you can expect.
The Basilica of the Annunciation
The Basilica of the Annunciation is a Roman Catholic Church in
Nazareth that’s dedicated to an event narrated in Luke’s gospel. It’s
the story of how a young girl named Mary agreed to give birth to
Jesus (Luke 1:28, 30–32). You may wonder how anybody could
know the location of such an event after 2,000 years (Chapter 9
takes up whether the story is historical to begin with). There are
some caves deep below the basilica that folks began regarding as
Mary’s childhood home as early as the 200s. Three different
churches have been built on top of these caves. The current basil-
ica, dedicated in 1968, exposes all of those layers to view.
The best day to visit the Basilica is March 25, the day of the Feast
of the Annunciation in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions.

The Church of the Nativity
The Church of the Nativity commemorates the birthplace of Jesus,
which, of course, was Bethlehem. Matthew and Luke mention that
Jesus was born in the city of David (Matthew 2:1, 4–6; Luke 2:1–7;
see Chapter 9). Matthew’s gospel mentions that Jesus was born at
home (Matthew 2:11), but Luke’s gospel mentions that Jesus was
born in a stable. By the early 100s CE, several Christians mentioned
a particular Bethlehem cave as the spot where Jesus was born. When
Constantine’s mother, Helena, came to the region hunting for holy
sites in 324 CE, she built a church over the cave.
The best days to visit the Church of the Nativity are December 24–25,
Christmas Eve and Christmas.
Capernaum, Where Jesus Lived
Capernaum, a village on the northwest coast of the Sea of Galilee,
served as Jesus’s home base during his Galilean ministry, probably
because his first disciples lived there (see Chapters 10 and 13). Exca-
vations from the 20th century to the present day have uncovered the
black basalt walls of a synagogue and an octagonal structure super-
imposed over a room. Lower rooms are usually older rooms, and this
one dates to the first century CE. Graffiti in the room associate it with
Jesus, and a fourth-century pilgrim account identifies it as the site
of Peter’s house, where his mother-in-law was cured (Mark 1:29–31).
The Church of the Multiplication 
of the Loaves and Fishes
Heptapegon (Greek for “Seven Springs,” which in Arabic was short-
ened to “Tabgha”) was identified as the place where Jesus multi-
plied loaves of bread and fishes to feed thousands (Mark 6:34–44;
see Chapter 12). According to the fourth-century pilgrim Egeria,
the site actually did triple duty, because it was also associated with
the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7) and Jesus’s resurrection
appearance where he rehabilitates Peter (John 21). Each location
has a separate church today.
The Mount of Transfiguration
There’s a tradition in the gospels that Jesus took some of his disciples
up a mountain and was transformed before their eyes, appearing in
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
308

dazzling white clothes and speaking with two biblical figures from
the past, Moses and Elijah (Mark 9:1–13; see Chapter 12). The site
associated with this transfiguration of Jesus moved around a lot in
the first four Christian centuries, but in 348 CE Cyril of Jerusalem
picked Mount Tabor as the most likely spot. Three chapels (one
each for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah) were built, and their ruins are
still visible under a Catholic basilica built in 1924. If you visit in
early August, your trip may coincide with the annual feast of the
Transfiguration.
Temple Mount
Herod the Great expanded both the Jerusalem Temple and the hill-
top on which it stood, building massive retaining walls and filling
them with earth (Chapter 7 has more on his building program). Even
though the Romans destroyed the Temple and the buildings on top
in 70 CE, they left the retaining walls of the platform (like the Western
Wall, where Jews have mourned the loss of the Temple for centuries).
Along the south wall, you can still see the monumental staircase that
led to the Temple platform in Jesus’s day (see Chapter 14). That wall
also bears a carbon imprint of the arches of shops and stalls burned
onto the stone when the Romans destroyed the city.
The Upper Room
The Upper Room, which is the supposed site of the Last Supper
(Mark 14:15; see Chapter 14) and the descent of the Holy Spirit on
the disciples (Acts 2:1–4), is the least reliable of the ten places in
this chapter. Excavations on Jerusalem’s Mount Zion have exposed a
Roman-period building there, but nobody mentions a church at the
site until the 300s CE, and it wasn’t associated with Last Supper until
the fifth century. There’s no church there now, only some ruins
beneath the floor of the Tomb of David.
The Garden of Gethsemane
This garden, on the Mount of Olives east of Temple Mount in
Jerusalem, is where Jesus went to pray after his last supper with the
disciples, and it’s where he was betrayed and arrested. The synoptic
gospels call the garden Gethsemane (Mark 14:32; see Chapter 14).
This site has a decent claim to early veneration because Christian
pilgrimages to the site predate Constantine. The present church on
the site is the Church of All Nations.
Chapter 20: Top Ten Pilgrimage Sites Associated with Jesus 309

The Way of the Cross
When Jesus’s verdict was decided, he was loaded with the patibu-
lum or crossbeam on which he’d be crucified and was marched to
Golgotha, which was just outside the walls of Jerusalem (see
Chapter 14). His actual path most likely took him from the Citadel
near the Jaffa Gate to a quarry where the present Church of the
Holy Sepulchre stands (see the next section for more on this site).
The Citadel was the high point of the city (Gabbatha in Aramaic
means high point; see John 19:13). It was where Pilate usually held
court when he visited Jerusalem. But early Christians living in
Jerusalem developed different notions of the sites associated with
Jesus’s final journey, which led them to replicate his way of the
cross along various paths during the first millennium.
In the 1300s, the Franciscans (a Roman Catholic religious order)
organized a devotional walk in Jerusalem with 8 (then 14) stations
marking events on Jesus’s final walk. The path is called the Via
Dolorosa, or “Way of Sorrows.” If you visit, try to time it with either
the Catholic or Orthodox celebration of Good Friday in early
spring (the day commemorating Jesus’s crucifixion) — as long as
you don’t mind huge crowds packed into narrow places!
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the holiest site in Christendom
and is a designated basilica. It houses the traditional site of both
the crucifixion and the empty tomb (sepulchre is Latin for tomb;
see Chapter 14 for more on Jesus’s crucifixion).
Christians of the first generation worshipped at this location until
the First Jewish Revolt disrupted things in 66 CE. After the Second
Jewish Revolt from 132–135 CE, Roman Emperor Hadrian filled in
the quarry where the crucifixions had taken place to provide a
base for his Capitoline Temple. But Christians remembered the
site, and when Constantine’s mother, Helena, came to find the holy
places (325–327 CE), the Jerusalem Christians told her this was
where Jesus had been crucified. Constantine built a church there
even though he had to excavate the whole ancient quarry to do so.
Constantine’s Church didn’t survive the Crusades intact, and sub-
sequent earthquakes, fires, and destructions led to its current
hodgepodge of architecture. But underneath the various building
layers lies a holy site that has a strong claim to authenticity.
