Preface
Preface
Here follows a collection of sequences, including sequences, which satisfy some simple diﬀerence equa-
tions. The reader is also referred to Calculus 3b. Since my aim also has been to demonstrate some
solution strategy I have as far as possible structured the examples according to the following form
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
One is used to from high school immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level are often so complicated that it in general will be a good investment
also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to be absolutely certain of what to do
in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can always be performed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. Instead, write in a plain language
what you mean or want to do.
It is my hope that these examples, of which many are treated in more ways to show that the solutions
procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students who have just started their
studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Sequences in General
Example 1.1 Check if the sequence
an =
n
n + 1 −n + 1
n
is convergent or divergent. Find its limit, if it is convergent.
Here we have several possibilities:
1st variant. If the numerator and the denominator in both fractions are divided by n, it follows by
the rules of calculations that
an =
n
n + 1 −n + 1
n
=
1
1 + 1
n
−

1 + 1
n

→
1
1 + 0 −(1 + 0) = 0
for n →∞.
2nd variant. If we remove 1 from both fractions we get
an =
n
n + 1 −n + 1
n
=

1 −
1
n + 1

−

1 + 1
n

= −
1
n + 1 −1
n →0
for n →∞.
3rd variant. If everything is put on the same fraction line, we get s
an =
n
n + 1 −n + 1
n
= n2 −(n + 1)2
(n + 1)n
= −2n + 1
(n + 1)n = −
2 + 1
n
n + 1 →0
for n →∞.
It is seen in all three variants that the sequence is convergent and its limit is 0. ♦

Example 1.2 Check if the sequence
an =
n2
n + 1 −n2 + 1
n
is convergent or divergent. In case of convergence, ﬁnd its limit.
1st variant. (Does not work, but it illustrates the problem). If we reduce by n in the numerator and
the denominator in the two fractions, we get
an =
n2
n + 1 −n2 + 1
n
=
n
1 + 1
n
−n −1
n →∞−∞−0.
This is an illegal type of convergence and nothing can be concluded in this way.
2nd variant. (The elegant variant). Add 0 = −1 + 1 to the ﬁrst numerator and apply that n2 −1 =
(n + 1)(n −1):
an
=
n2
n + 1 −n2 + 1
n
= (n2 −1) + 1
n + 1

n −1 +
1
n + 1 −n −1
n = −1 +
1
n + 1 −1
n →−1 + 0 −0 = −1
for n →∞.
3rd variant. (Brute force). Put everything on the same fraction line and reduce,
an
=
n2
n + 1 −n2 + 1
n
= n3 −(n + 1)(n2 + 1)
(n + 1)n
= n3 −{n3 + n2 + n + 1}
(n + 1)n
=
−n2 + n + 1
n2 + n
= −1 −
1
n2 + n →−1
for n →∞.
The latter calculation can of course be performed more or less elegant. ♦
Example 1.3 Check if the sequence
an = cos nπ
2
is convergent or divergent. Find the limit in case of convergence.
It follows from
an+4 = cos (n + 4)π
2
= cos nπ
2 = an,
that the values
a1 = 0,
a2 = −1,
a3 = 0,
a4 = 1,
are repeated cyclically, i.e. they all occur inﬁnitely often. Thus we have four candidates of the limit,
but since any possible limit is unique, it does not exist in this case, and the sequence is divergent. ♦

Example 1.4 . Check if the sequence
an = n(−1)n
is convergent or divergent. Find the limit in case of convergence.
Since the subsequence
a2n = (2n)(−1)2n = 2n
is divergent, the “bigger sequence” (an) (it contains more elements) must also be divergent. ♦
Example 1.5 . Check if the sequence
an = an
n ,
a ∈R,
is convergent or divergent. Find the limit in case of convergence.
This sequence contains a parameter, and the question of convergence depends on the the size of the
parameter.
1) If |a| > 1, it follows from the magnitudes that
|an| = 1
n|a|n →∞
for n →∞.
(The exponential function “dominates” the power function in n). In this case we have divergence.
2) If |a| ≤1, we get the estimate
|an −0| = |an| = 1
n|a|n ≤1
n →0
for n →∞.
It follows immediately from the deﬁnition that (an) is convergent and that its limit is 0. ♦
Example 1.6 . Check if the sequence
an = ln(n2 + 1) −2 ln n
is convergent or divergent. Find the limit in case of convergence.
The type of convergence is “∞−∞, so we ﬁrst apply the functional equation of the logarithm. Thus
an = ln(n2 + 1) −2 ln n = ln
n2 + 1
n2

= ln

1 + 1
n2

.
Then follow at least two variants.
1st variant. Since ln is continuous on p˚a R+, and 1 + 1
n2 →1 for n →∞, we can interchange ln
and the limit,
lim
n→∞an = ln

and it follows that the sequence is convergent towards the limit 0.
2nd variant. According to Taylor’s formula,
ln(1 + t) = t + tε(t).
We get by putting t = 1/n2,
an = ln

1 + 1
n2

n2 + 1
n2 ε

n

→0 + 0 · 0 = 0
for n →∞,
hence the sequence is convergent and its limit is 0. ♦
Example 1.7 . Check if the sequence
an = (−1)n
n
+ 1 + (−1)n
2
is convergent or divergent. Find the limit in case of convergence.
Due to the change of sign (−1)n a good strategy would be to consider odd and even indices separately.
Thus we shall consider the two subsequences,
a2n+1 = (−1)2n+1
2n + 1
+ 1 + (−1)2n+1
2
= −
1
2n + 1 →0
for n →∞,
and
a2n = (−1)2n
2n
+ 1 + (−1)2n
2
= 1
2n + 1 →1
for n →∞.
It follows that we have two diﬀerent candidates of the limit, and since a limit is always unique, we
conclude that it does not exist and the sequence is divergent. ♦
Example 1.8 . Check if the sequence
an = 1
n sin5 n
is convergent or divergent. Find the limit if the sequence is convergent.
This example is trying to pull the reader’s leg, because one is persuaded to concentrate on the mys-
terious term sin5 n, which apparently cannot be controlled.
Notice that we always have | sin x| ≤1, so
|an −0| = |an| = 1
n| sin5 n| ≤1
n →0
for n →∞,
and we conclude that
|an −0| →0
for n →∞,
The sequence is convergent according to the deﬁnition and its limit is 0. ♦

Example 1.9 . Check if the sequence
an =
√
n + 1 −√n
is convergent or divergent. Find its limit if it is convergent.
This example is of the type “∞−∞′′. It follows from
(a + b)(a −b) = a2 −b2,
that
a −b = a2 −b2
a + b .
Then putting a = √n + 1 and b = √n we ﬁnd
an
=
√
n + 1 −√n = a −b = a2 −b2
a + b
=
(n + 1) −n
√n + 1 + √n
=
1
√n + 1 + √n →0
for n →∞,
thus the sequence is convergent and its limit is 0. ♦

Example 1.10 . Check if the sequence
an =
2n −3
3n + 7
4
is convergent or divergent. Find its limit if it is convergent.
The function f(x) = x4 is continuous and independent of n, and the “inner part” converges,
2n −3
3n + 7 =

3 + 7
n

In this case f and the limit can be interchanged, hence the sequence is convergent, and the limit is

which is correct, as long as the exponent is a constant, i.e. it does not depend on n. ♦
Example 1.11 . Check if the sequence
an = n4/3 cos

n!π/(
√
2)n
n + 1
is convergent or divergent. Find the limit in case of convergence.
We ﬁrst rewrite an in the following way,
an = n4/3
n + 1 cos

n!π/(
√
2)n
.
The ﬁrst factor tends to ∞,
n4/3
n + 1 =
3√n
1 + 1
n
→∞
for n →∞,
which, however, in general is not suﬃcient, because cos x during the limit might lie close to 0, so we
get the type of convercence “∞· 0”.
Notice that if we only consider even indices, then we get rid of the square root. By the chance of
parameter n →2n we get
cos

because (2n)!/2n is even for n ≥2. This proves that we have for n ≥2,
a2n = (2n)4/3
2n + 1 cos
(2n)!
2n

2n + 1 →∞

and the sequence is divergent. ♦
Example 1.12 . Check if the sequence
an = cot 1
n −n
is convergent or divergent. Find the limit in case of convergence
This is a tricky example, in which one must
1) replace 1/n by x = 1/n, i.e. x →0+ for n →∞,
2) apply that cot x = cos x/ sin x, followed by putting everything on the same fraction line,
3) apply Taylor’s formula in both the numerator and the denominator, followed by some reduction,
4) ﬁnally take the limit x →0+.
The details of this program look like the following:
an
=
cos 1
n −n = cot x −1
x = cos x
sin x −1
x = x cos x −sin x
x sin x

We conclude that the sequence is convergent with the limit 0. ♦
Example 1.13 . Check if the given sequence is convergent or divergent. Find the limit in case of
convergence.
an =
3n + (−2)n
3n+1 + (−2)n+1 ,
n ∈N.
When we estimate expressions consisting of two terms the trick is to put the numerically larger and
dominating term outside the expression as a factor.
We get by using this principle in both the
numerator and the denominator that

Example 1.14 . Check if the sequence

The type of convergence is “∞−∞”. We note that both terms behave approximately as n, so we
subtract n from both terms:

Example 1.15 . Check if the sequence

The type is “∞−∞”. In this case the trick a −b = (a2 −b2)/(a + b) does not work. However, we
succeed by a small modiﬁcation. First notice that the cubic is removed by taking the third power, i.e.
we start by considering a3 −b3 where a =
3√
n3 + 1 amd b = n. Then
1 = (n3 + 1) −n3 = a3 −b3 = (a −b)(a2 + ab + b2),
hence by a rearrangement,
an =

Example 1.16 . Check if the sequence

Summable sequences
Example 2.1 . Given a real sequence (an). Deﬁne another sequence (bn) by
bn = 1
n {a1 + · · · + an} ,
n ∈N.
Prove that if (an) is convergent with the limit a, then (bn) is also convergent with the limit a.
Give an example of a divergent sequence (an), for which the corresponding sequence (bn) is convergent.
We say that a sequence (an) is summable, if its corresponding sequence (bn) deﬁned as above is
convergent. We shall prove that if (an) is convergent, then (an) is also summable. Then we shall
construct an example of a summable sequence (an), which is not convergent. Hence, there are more
summable sequences that convergent ones.
1) Assume that an →a for n →∞. This means that one to every ε > 0 can ﬁnd some N = N(ε) ∈N,
such that
(2) |a −an| < ε
2
for every n ≥N(ε).
Then
|a −bn| =

n |(a −a1) + (a −a1) + · · · + (a −an)| ≤1

since the n −N(ε) terms of the latter sum are all < ε/2 by (2).

2) The classical example of a divergent sequence (an), for which (bn) is convergent, is
an = (−1)n−1,
where b2n−1 =
1
2n −1 og b2n = 0.
Clearly, bn →0 for n →∞.
A slightly more “wild” example is
a2n−1 = √n
and
a2n = −√n.
In this case,
b2n−1 =
√n
2n −1
og
b2n = 0,
thus bn →0 for n →∞.
Remark 2.1 . It follows from
nbn = a1 + a2 + · · · + an,
that b1 = a1 and
an = nbn −(n −1)bn−1
for n ≥2.
Example 2.2 We deﬁne for a real sequence (an) another sequence (bn) by
bn = 1
n {a1 + · · · + an},
n ∈N.
Prove that if an →∞for n →∞, then bn →∞for n →∞.
Give an example of a sequence (an) which does not tend towards ∞for n tending towards ∞, for
which the corresponding sequence (bn) fulﬁls bn →∞for n →∞.
First note that if |an| ≤c, then also |bn| ≤c. It follows that if bn →∞, then (an) must be unbounded.
Assume that an →∞for n →∞. This means that we to every c > 0 can ﬁnd an N = N(c) ∈N,
such that (e.g.)
an > 3c
for every n ≥N(c).
If so, we have for n > N(c) that

Then for every n ≥N1,

· 3c > −c + 3c −c = c.
Since for every c > 0 we can choose N1, such that
bn > c
for every n ≥N1,
we conclude that bn →∞for n →∞.
By the introducing remark, bn →∞implies that (an) in unbounded. We note that an unbounded
sequence does not necessarily tend towards ∞. Choose e.g.
a2n = 2n
and
a2n−1 = 0.
Then (an) is unbounded, and it does not tend towards ∞. We note that b1 = 0 and
b2n = 1
2n(2 + 4 + · · · + 2n) = 1
n(1 + 2 + · · · + n) = 1

and
b2n+1 =

2n + 1(2 + 4 + · · · + 2n) = n(n + 1)
2n + 1
→∞,
thus. bn →∞.
We have here used that
(3) 1 + 2 + · · · + n = 1
2 n(n + 1),
n ∈N.
For completeness, we see that this is true for n = 1, 2, 3. If (3) holds for some n ∈N, then we get for
the following term by using (3) that
1 + 2 + · · · + n + (n + 1) = 1
2 n(n + 1) + (n + 1) = 1
2 (n + 1)(n + 2),
which we recognize as (3) where n has been replaced by n+1. Then (3) follows in general by induction
(the boot strap principle), because if (3) holds for some n, then it also holds for the following term,
etc.. Since (3) is true for n = 1 (in the beginning), we see that (3) is true for all n ∈N. ♦

It does not yet follow that the sequence actually is convergent. We continue in the following way.
A sequence (an) is convergent, if it is (weakly) increasing and bounded from above.
1) The sequence is bounded from above.
Obviously, a1 = 1/
√
2 < (1 +
√
3)/2 [the possible limit]
If an < (1 +
√
3)/2, then it follows for the next element that also
an+1 =

an + 1

2


1 + 3 + 2
√



√

2 .
Then it follows by induction that (an) is bounded from above.
Alternatively it follows from the assumption an < 3/2 that
an+1 =

an + 1
2 <

3
2 + 1
2 =
√
2 < 3
2,
hence by induction, an < 3/2, and it is bounded from above.
2) The sequence is increasing.
Firstly,
a2 =

1
√
2 + 1
2 >

1
2 =
1
√
2 = a1,
i.e. a2 > a1.
Then assume that an > an−1 for some n ≥2. (This is at least true for n = 2). Then
an+1 −an =

an + 1


an−1 + 1
2 =
an −an−1

an + 1
2 +

an−1 + 1

> 0,
and it follows by induction that (an) is increasing.
3) We have now proved that (an) is convergent.
We showed in the beginning that a = (1 +
√
3)/2 is the only possible limit
Since the limit exists, we must have the limit a = (1 +
√
3)/2. ♦

Example 3.2 . Let the sequence (an) be recursively given by
a1 = 1,
an+1 =
√
3an,
n ∈N.
Prove that (an) is convergent, and ﬁnd its limit.
If an →a for n →∞, it follows by taking the limit in the recursion formula,
a =
√
3a,
or a2 = 3a by a squaring.
We use here that taking the square root is a continuous operation, so the limit and the square root
can be interchanged. Thus we conclude that a = 0 and a = 3 are the only possible limits. We shall
prove that the sequence indeed is convergent. (Our assumption above).
1) The sequence is bounded.
If a ≥1, then an+1 ≥
√
3 ≥1, i.e. (an) is bounded from below. It follows in particular that if the
limit a exists, then we must have a ̸= 0, thus a = 3 is the only possible limit.
If an < 3, then an+1 = √3an <
√
3 · 3 = 3, and (an) is also bounded from above.
2) The sequence is increasing.
In fact,
an+1 −an =
√
3an −

3an−1 =
√
3 · {√an −√an−1}
shows that if an > an−1 ≥1, then also √an > √an−1, hence an+1 −an > 0, and we have
an+1 > an.
From a2 =
√
3 > 1 = a1 follows that a2 > a1. Then by induction,
1 = a1 < a2 < · · · < an < an+1 < · · · .
3) Conclusion.
An increasing bounded sequence (an) is convergent, so the given sequence is convergent. The only
possible limits were a = 0 and a = 3. But since all an ≥1, we can exclude a = 0, and
lim
n→∞an = 3.

By the inductions assumption we get an−1 −an ≥0.
We see that we also have an −an+1 ≥0, hence an ≥an+1.
Then by induction, at an−1 ≥an for all n ≥2, and the sequence is weakly decreasing.

4) The function f(t) = 1

Example 3.5 Consider the recursively given sequence (an), where a1 = c ∈R, an+1 = f(an) for
f(x) = x + x2.
The function f has the ﬁx point x0 = 0.
Show graphically that the ﬁx point is
attractive for some values of c < 0, and repelling for every c > 0.
It follows from the equation f(x0) = x0, i.e. x2
0 = 0, that x0 = 0, hence x0 = 0 is a ﬁx point. Since
f(x) = x2 + x =

It is diﬃcult to sketch on the ﬁgure in MAPLE the lines which shows the convergence, so this is left
to the reader. We see that x0 is attractive for c ∈[−1, 0] and repelling for c ∈R \ [−1, 0]
We shall now prove these claims.
1) If c > 0, then f(c) = c2 + c > c, and f(c) moves away from x0 = 0, thus the point is repelling.
2) If r c < −1, then f(c) = c2 + c = |c|(|c| −1) > 0, and we are back in case 1..
3) If either c = 0 or c = −1, then f(c) = 0. Since trivially f(0) = 0 in all the following iterations, it
follows that x0 = 0 is attractive for these values of c.
4) Finally, if −1 < c < 0, then f(c) = c + c2 = c(1 + c) < 0, and f(c) > c, hence
c < f(c) < 0,
and we conclude that the ﬁx point is attractive for c ∈] −1, 0[. ♦

Example 3.7 Let the sequence (an) be recursively given by
a1 = 100,
an+1 = 2√an −1.
1) Prove by induction that an > 1 for every n ∈N.
2) Prove by induction that the sequence (an) is decreasing.
3) Finally, prove that the sequence (an) is convergent, and ﬁnd its limit value.
1) Assume that an > 1. Then an+1 = 2√an −1 > 2 · 1 −1 = 1, and we see that an > 1 implies that
also the successor satisﬁes an+1 > 1. Since a1 = 100 > 1, the claim follows by induction, hence
(an) is bounded from below.
2) We get by insertion, a2 = 2
√
100 −1 = 19 < 100 = a1, thus a2 < a1.
Assume that an−1 > an (this is true for n = 2). When n is replaced by n + 1, we get
an −an+1 = (2√an−1 −1) −(2√an −1) = 2(√an−1 −√an) > 0,
hence an > an+1. We conclude by induction that
a1 > a2 > a3 > · · · > an−1 > an > an+1 > · · · ≥1.

3) Since (an) is decreasing and bounded from below, it follows that (an) is convergent. Denote the
limit value by a. By taking the limit of the recursion formula we get
0 = lim
n→∞an+1 −lim
n→∞2√an + 1 = a −2√a + 1 = (√a −1)2,
hence √a = 1, and thus limn→∞an = a = 1.
Remark 3.1 If we consider the function f(x) = 2√x−1, where f ′(x) =
1
√x, then f ′(x0) = f ′(1) = 1,
corresponding to a limiting case, in which one usually can say nothing about the convergence. This is
also demonstrated by an iteration on a pocket calculator, because the approximation becomes slower
the closer one is to a = 1,
a5 = 3, 26904,
a10 = 1, 69909,
a15 = 1, 39299,
a20 = 1, 26997.

Example 3.8 Find the smallest positive solution of the equation
cos x =
1
1 + 25 · 10−6/ sin x
with four decimals by using a convenient iteration method. Then comment on the convergence.
Remark 3.2 This is a very vicious example! ♦
The diﬃculty of this example apparently stems from the denominator on the right hand side. First
we rewrite in the following way
(4) cos x =
1
1 + 25 · 10−6/ sin x =
40000 sin x
40000 sin x + 1 = 1 −
1
40000 sin x + 1.
It is easily seen that x > 0 must be small, hence by Taylor’s formula
sin x ≈x
og
cos x ≈1 −x2
2 ,
and (4) can approximatively be written
1 −x2
2 ≈1 −
1
40000x + 1,
i.e.
x2(40000x + 1) ≈2.
We must in particular have 40000x ≫1, thus we have in the ﬁrst iteration (the starting value)
x ≈1/
3√
20000 ≈0, 03684.
Then the method is reduced to the well-known regula falsi, i.e. insert
x1 = 0, 03683,
x2 = 0, 03684,
x3 = 0, 03685
into (4) and compare,

We are just inside the range of the accuracy of the pocket calculator, because the factor 40000 gives
an error of rounding oﬀwhich is 40000 times bigger than usual (i.e. 40000 times 10−12).
It is quite ironical that our ﬁrst approximation by using Taylor’s formula in fact gives the best
approximation with four decimals,

F ′(x) = x +

Even if we choose the value x0 = 0, 037 as our start [where we have an eye to the value 0,03684] the
iteration is extremely slow,
x1 = 0, 036991,
x2 = 0, 036982,
x3 = 0, 036974.
If we instead rewrite (4) to
40000 cos x · sin x + cos x = 40000 sin x,
i.e. to
F(x) = 20000 sin 2x −40000 sin x + cos x = 0,
then
F ′(x) = 40000 cos 2x −40000 cos x −sin x,
and we get by the Newton-Raphson iteration
xn+1 = xn −20000 sin 2xn −40000 sin xn + cos xn
40000 cos 2xn −40000 cos xn −sin xn
with starting value x0 = 0, 037, the ﬁrst values

Example 4.3 Find a sequence of C1-functions fn : [0, 1] →R, which converges uniformly on [0, 1]
towards a C1-function f : [0, 1] →R, and for which the sequence of derivatives (f ′
n) is pointwise
convergent, but not converging towards the function f ′.
The best strategy must be ﬁrst to choose some convenient pointwisely convergent sequence of functions
(f ′
n), where the limit function is not continuous, and then integrate the terms of this sequence from
0.
It is well-known that gn(x) = xn is pointwise convergent towards the discontinuous function
g(x) =

0
for x ∈[0, 1[,
1
for x = 1.
Choose
fn(x) =

0
gn(t) dt = xn+1
n + 1.
It is then obvious that
f ′
m(x) = xn = gn(x) →g(x)
for n →∞.
It follows from the estimate
|fn(x) −0| = xn+1
n + 1 ≤
1
n + 1 →0
for n →∞,
alle x ∈[0, 1],
that fn →0 uniformly. It is obvious that f(x) = 0 is a diﬀerentiable function and f ′(x) = 0, which is
̸= lim f ′
n(x) = g(x).

By using the example above (one introduces a singularity at x = 1) it is possible to construct a
sequence of functions (fn), which converges uniformly towards 0 in [0, 1] where
lim
n→∞f ′
n(x) ̸= 0
for ethvert x ∈[0, 1] ∩Q.
The construction, however, uses series which formally have not yet been introduced.
Example 4.4 For every n ∈N we put
fn(x) = nxe−nx2,
x ∈R.
Find limn→∞fn(x), and prove that
lim

1) Pointwise convergence. What is here obvious? When x = 0 is ﬁxed, then
fn(0) = 0 →0 = f(0)
for n →∞.
If instead x ̸= 0 (fast), it follows by the magnitudes that
fn(x) = x ·

for n →∞, da ex2 > 1.

Remark 4.1 All functions fn(x) are continuous.
Since the integration and the limit cannot be
interchanged, the convergence of (fn) can never be uniform. ♦
Example 4.5 Let fn : R →R be given by
fn(x) =
x2n
1 + x2n ,
n ∈N.
1) Prove that the sequence (fn) is pointwise convergent, but not uniformly convergent.
2) Prove that the sequence (fn) is uniformly convergent in the interval

.
1) This example is tricky, because one must split it up into three cases,
(a) |x| < 1,
(b) |x| = 1,
(c) |x| > 1.
In the remaining part of this question we keep x ﬁxed in the given domain.
(a) If |x| < 1, then
|fn(x) −0| = fn(x) =
x2n
1 + x2n ≤x2n →0
for n →∞.
(b) If |x| = 1, i.e. x = ±1, then fn(±1) = 1

(c) If |x| > 1, then
fn(x) =
x2n
1 + x2n = 1 −

1 + x2n →1 −0 = 1
for n →∞.
Summarizing we see that (fn) is pointwise convergent with the limit function

Since every fn is continuous and the limit function f is not continuous [cf. the ﬁgure], it follows
that the sequence is not uniformly convergent.

Since every fn(x) is continuous on [0, ∞[, and f(x) is not continuous, it follows that the convergence
cannot be uniform.

Pointwise convergence. What is obvious? For x = 0 we have

1n = 1 →1 = f(0)
for n →∞.

Uniform convergence i ]0, ∞[? This is a really tricky question, because the limit function f(x) = 0
is continuous in ]0, ∞[. We shall nevertheless prove that the convergence is not uniform!
First note that the range of every fn is ]0, 1[, i.e. fn(]0, ∞[) = ]0, 1[.
If we choose xn =

n√
2 −1 > 0, we get
|fn(xn) −0| = fn(xn) =
1
(1 + {
n√
2 −1})n = 1
2.
Thus, we shall always obtain the value 1
2 for every fn, and since the constant 1
2 “not can be made as
small as possible”, the convergence cannot be uniform.
Uniform convergence in [1, ∞[? In this case the limit function is again f(x) = 0. Since we are far
away from the discontinuity at x = 0, it will be reasonable to get rid of x by an estimation: For x ≥1
we have 1 + x2 ≥2, thus
|fn(x) −0| = fn(x) =
1
(1 + x2)n ≤1
2n →0
for n →∞,
and we conclude that the convergence is uniform in [1, ∞[.
Remark 4.2 The above will always be accepted. A more careful solution is the following.
1) To every ε > 0 we choose N = N(ε), such that
1
2N ≤ε

choose N ≥ln(1/ε)
ln 2
ﬁxed

.
2) Since (1/2n) is decreasing for increasing n, we have
1
2n ≤1
2N ≤ε
for every n ≥N(ε)
[independently of x].
3) For every x ≥1 we have
1
(1 + x2)n ≤1
2n ≤ε
for every n ≥N(ε)
[independently of x].
Finally we summarize the above:
To every ε > 0 there exists an N = N(ε) [which does not depend on x], such that for every n ≥N
and every x ≥1,
|fn(x) −0| ≤ε,
which means that we have uniform convergence on [1, ∞[.

Since we now can interchange the limit process and the integration, we may erroneously jump
to the wrong conclusion that the convergence should be uniform. The last two questions of the
example show that this is not the case.
3) We get by diﬀerentiation
f ′
n(x) = n(1 −x)n −n2x(1 −x)n−1 = n(1 −x)n−1(1 −x −nx) = n(1 −x)n−1{1 −(n + 1)x}.
Since fn(0) = fn(1) = 0, and fn(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1, the continuous function fn(x) must have a
maximum.
Since fn ∈C∞, and since f ′
n(x) = 0 is only fulﬁlled for x =

n + 1 in ]0, 1[, this value corresponds
to the unique maximum. The value of the function here is

Since 1

Example 4.10 Given the function
F(x) = ex sin x −1,
x ∈

from Example 3.10. Let fn :

fn(x) = x −

(ex sin x)n ,
n ∈N.
1) Express by means of α the largest set A ⊆

vergent in A. Find the limit function.
2) Check if the sequence is also uniformly convergent on A. Does there exist a largest set B ⊆

0, π

,
such that the sequence is uniformly convergent on B?
1) Since ex sin x = F(x) + 1 > 0 for x ∈

i.e. F(x) ≥0.
According to Example 3.10 this is true for x ∈A =

is increasing.
If x = α, then F(α) + 1 = 1, hence
fn(α) = α −1.
If α < x ≤π

F(x) + 1 < 1, hence

2) Since every function fn is continuous in A, and the limit function f is not continuous in A, the
sequence cannot be uniformly convergent in A.
There does not exist any largest set B, on which (fn) is uniformly convergent. In fact, for every
ε ∈

we have that (fn) is uniformly convergent in

contains all these intervals is

Alternatively, choose a sequence (yn), such that
1
1 + F(yn) =

n√
2,
i.e. F(yn) =
n√
2 −1
(→0 for n →∞).
Then yn →α+, and
fn(yn) = yn −1
2 →α −1
2
for n →∞,
hence (fn(yn)) neither converges towards α nor towards α −1.

Linear diﬀerence equations
Example 5.1 1) Find the complete solution of the diﬀerence equation
xk + xk−1 = 0,
k ≥1.
2) Find a particular solution of the diﬀerence equation
(6) xk + xk−1 = 4,
k ≥1,
and then ﬁnd the total solution of (6), for which x0 = 1.
A. Linear diﬀerence equation of ﬁrst order.
D. Find the solution of the homogeneous equation and then a particular solution.
I. 1) The characteristic polynomial R + 1 has the root R = −1, thus the complete solution of the
homogeneous equation is given by
xk = c · (−1)k,
k ∈N0,
c ∈R.
2) By inspection we see that the constant solution xk = 2 is one solution of (6).
Hence the
complete solution is
xk = 2 + c · (−1)k,
k ∈N0,
c ∈R.
For k = 0 we get x0 = 1 = 2 + c, i.e. c = −1, and the wanted solution becomes
xk = 2 + (−1)k+1,
k ∈N0,
i.e.
xk =


for k even,
3
for k odd,
k ∈N0.
Example 5.2 Find a particular solution of the diﬀerence equation
xk −xk−1 = 4,
k ≥1,
and then ﬁnd the complete solution.
A. Diﬀerence equation of ﬁrst order.
D. Guess some particular solution.
I. Put xk = 4k. Then we get by insertion (i.e. we are testing this sequence) that
xk −xk−1 = 4k −4(k −1) = 4,
and we have shown that xk = 4k, k ∈N, is a particular solution.
The characteristic polynomial R −1 has the root R = 1, hence the total solution is given by
xk = 4k + c,
k ∈N0,
c ∈R.

Example 5.3 Find that solution of the diﬀerence equation
xk + xk−1 = k,
k ≥1,
for which x0 = 2.
A. Linear, inhomogeneous diﬀerence equation of ﬁrst order.
D. Guess a particular solution.
I. If we guess on xk = αk + β, then we get by insertion that
αk + β + α(k −1) + β = 2αk = (2β −α),
which is equal to the variable k for α = 1
2 and β = 1
4.
Since the characteristic polynomial R + 1 has the root R = −1, the complete solution is given by
xk = 1
2 k + 1
4 + c · (−1)k,
k ∈N0,
c ∈R.
For k = 0 we get
c = x0 −1
4 = 2 −1
4 = 7

thus the wanted solution is
xk = 1

k ∈N0.
Example 5.4 Find that solution of the diﬀerence equation
xk −xk−1 = k,
k ≥1,
for which x2 = 4.
A. Linear, inhomogeneous diﬀerence equation of ﬁrst order.
D. Solve the corresponding homogeneous equation. Then guess a particular solution.
I. The characteristic polynomial R −1 has the root R = 1.
Thus, the complete solution of the
homogeneous equation is given by
xk = c,
k ∈N0,
c ∈R.
Since already xk = 1 is a solution of the homogeneous equation and since k · 1 occurs on the right
hand side of the equation, we guess in analogy with the method of solving diﬀerential equations
on a solution of the structure
xk = αk2 + βk,
k ∈N0.

We get by insertion,
xk −xk−1 = α

This expression is equal to the variable k, if α = β = 1
2, thus the complete solution is

c ∈R.
If k = 2, we get the condition

from which c = 1, and the solution is
xk = 1

Example 5.5 At some given time we have 1000 bacteria in a culture of bacteria . We assume in
general that the number of bacteria is increased by 250 % every second hour. How many bacteria will
there be after 24 hours?
A. Exponential growth (diﬀerence equation). Notice that since we are looking at 12 · 2 = 24 hours,
we shall ﬁnd x12.
D. There are some problems here with the interpretation of the text. If the increase really is 250 %,
then the corresponding diﬀerence equation becomes
xk = xk−1 + 5
2 xk−1 = 7
2 xk−1.
If the meaning instead is that the increase is 250 % of the previous value at time (k −1)2, then
the diﬀerence equation becomes
xk = 5
2 xk−1.
Since there is some linguistic uncertainty in the original text (I do not remember where I found
this example), we shall as an exercise go through the solving of both equations.
I. We have x0 = 1000.
1) In the ﬁrst interpretation we get

A. Diﬀerence equation for savings.
D. Write down the model of diﬀerence equation and then solve this equation.

C. Weak control. There is paid 4 · 600 = 2400 euro per year, hence 16 800 euro in 7 years, so the
result looks reasonable. considering the high (and today unrealistic) interest.

Example 5.7 In the following examples we shall deal with annuity loans.
The background is in
general the following:
A loan on G0 euro is repaid with a ﬁxed payment of A euro per settling period, and the interest to be
paid of the debt is r per settling period (where we give r as a usual fraction, and not in %). Let Gn
denote the remaining debt after n settling periods.
1) Prove that Gn satisﬁes
Gn −(1 + r)Gn−1 = −A,
n ≥1,
and then ﬁnd Gn.
2) Establish the condition that the debt is repaid.
A. Annuity loans.
D. Analyze the situation at the end of the n-th settling period in order to ﬁnd the diﬀerence equation
of the problem. Then solve this diﬀerence equation.
I. 1) The remaining debt Gn at the n-th settling period is equal to the remaining debt Gn−1 at the
(n −1)-th settling period, plus the interest, ×Gn−1, and minus the payment A, i.e.
Gn = (1 + r)Gn−1 −A,
which we rearrange as the solution
Gn −(1 + r)Gn−1 = −A,
n ≥1.
Here we guess a particular solution of the form Gn = α. We get by insertion (i.e. testing this
solution) that
Gn −(1 + r)Gn−1 = α −(1 + r)α = −rα = −A,
and a particular solution is the constant sequence
Gn = α = A
r ,
n ∈N0.
Since the corresponding homogeneous equation has the solution c·(1+r)n, the complete solution
of the inhomogeneous equation is given by
Gn = A
r + c · (1 + r)n,
n ∈N0,
c ∈R.
For n = 0 we get the condition
G0 = A
r + c,
i.e.
c = G0 −A
r ,
and the wanted solution becomes
Gn = A

2) The debt will be paid back, if and only if Gn at some time becomes ≤0. This means that
G0 −A
r < 0, hence
A > r · G0,
which is only expressing the reasonable fact that the payment must be bigger than the interest
in one settling period of the original loan.
Example 5.8 Let G0 and A be given, and assume that A is suﬃciently large to assure that the loan
will be paid. Find a formula for the number of settling periods which is needed to pay the debt (thus
the smallest number n of settling periods for which Gn ≤0.)

payment, by which the debt is paid in precisely N settling periods.

are 4 settling periods (quarters) per year. When is the loan repaid if the payment is 3 000 euro per
quarter? And when is the loan repaid, if we double the payment?

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

We get

400 · 100 000 = 9 · 250 = 2 250 < 3 000 = A,

thus the loan is repaid after 63 settling periods, corresponding to 15 3

Example 5.13 Let an = 1 + 2 + · · · + n, n ≥1. Find a diﬀerence equation which is fulﬁlled by an.
Then ﬁnd a formula for an.
A. Establishment and solution of a diﬀerence equation.
D. Look at an −an−1.
I. Obviously,
an −an−1 = n,
n ≥1.
The corresponding homogeneous equation has the constant solution
an = c,
n ∈N0,
c ∈R.
Then we guess the structure an = αn2 + βn. By insertion,

2. The complete solution becomes

Since a1 = 1 = 1
2 · 1 · 2 + c = 1 + c, we have c = 0, and the searched solution is
an = 1
2 n(n + 1),
n ∈N0.
Example 5.14 Let an = 1 + 22 + · · · + n2, n ≥1. Find a diﬀerence equation which is fulﬁlled by an.

A. Establish a (simple) diﬀerence equation.
D. Find such a diﬀerence equation for an, and solve it.
I. It is immediately seen that
an −an−1 = n2.
The corresponding homogeneous equation has the constant sequence an = c, c ∈R, as a solution.
Then we guess a particular solution of the form
an = αn3 + βn2 + γn,
hence by insertion,

By guessing the structure xk = a · 2k + b · 4k, we get by insertion (i.e. checking this possible

A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerence equation of third order. The corresponding homogeneous equa-
tion was dealt with in Example 5.22 (2).
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial; then guess a solution of the inhomogeneous equa-
tion.
I. The characteristic polynomial
R3 −2r2 −R + 2 = (R −2)(R −1)(R + 1)
has the three simple roots R = 2 and R = ±1. Since already R = 1 is a root, corresponding to the
solution xk = c, k ∈N0, of the homogeneous equation, our guess must be modiﬁed, so we guess a
particular solution of the form xk = a · k. We get by insertion,
xk −2xk−1 −xk−2 + 2xk−3 = a{k −2(k −1) −(k −2) + 2(k −3)}
= a{k −2k + 2 −k + 2 + 2k −6} = −2a,
which is equal to −2 for a = 1. Hence, the complete solution is given by
xk = k + c1 + c2(−1)k + c3 · 2k,
k ∈N0,
c1, c2, c3 ∈R.

A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerence equation of fourth order with two diﬀerent right hand sides.

part of the complex solution.

Example 5.27 Let the sequence xk fulﬁl the diﬀerence equation
xk + 16xk−4 = 17(−1)k,
k ≥4,
where also x0 = 1, x1 = −1, x2 = 9 and x3 = −1. Calculate x400.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerence equation of fourth order. We shall only ﬁnd x400.
D. Put yk = x4k, y100 = x400, and set up another diﬀerence equation.
I. If we put yk = x4k, then we get the diﬀerence equation
yk + 16yk−1 = 16,
k ≥1,
where y0 = x0 = 1. It is immediately seen that yk = 1, k ∈N0, is a solution of the inhomogeneous
equation, which also satisﬁes the condition. We therefore conclude that this is the wanted solution,
hence
y100 = x400 = 1.

Example 5.28 The so-called Fibonacci numbers Fn are deﬁned as the elements of the sequence which
satisﬁes
Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2,
n ≥2,
and the initial conditions F0 = 0, F1 = 1.
Find a general formula of the n-tt Fibonacci number Fn.
The Fibonacci numbers were mentioned for the ﬁrst time in a book from 1202. They were the solution
of the following problem:
Assume that any couple of rabbits which are more than one month of age bear a new couple of rabbits
at the end of each month. If one starts with one pair and none of the rabbits die, how many couples
of rabbits are there after n months?

Example 5.29 We consider in the usual plane n lines where each pair intersects each other, and
where no three lines intersect at the same point. Let An denote the number of domains which the
plane is divided in by these lines.
1) Calculate A2 and A3.
2) What is the connection between An and An−1? Use the result to ﬁnd a formula for An for every
n ≥2.
A. The setup of a diﬀerence equation.
D. Analyze A2 and A3, and the general case.
Figure 1: The case of 2 lines and 3 lines.
I. 1) Clearly, A2 = 4, and it follows by the ﬁgure that A3 = 7.
2) Given n−1 lines satisfying the conditions of the text. When we add the n-th line we get under
the same assumptions as above n −1 intersection points with the other lines, so the new line
is divided into n segments. Each of these segments will provide us with a new subdomain, so
the connection between An−1 and An becomes
An = An−1 + n,
i.e.
An −An−1 = n.
3) Clearly, all solutions of the homogeneous diﬀerence equation are the constant sequences An = c.
Then we guess of a particular solution of the form
An = α n2 + β n,
from which we get by insertion
An −An−1 = α
&
n2 −(n −1)2'
+ β{n −(n −1)} = 2nα + (β −α).
This expression is equal to n for α = 1
2 = β, so the complete solution becomes
An = 1

2 n(n + 1) + c,

It follows from the condition
A2 = 4 = 1
2 · 2 · (2 + 1) + c = 3 + c,
that c = 1, so the ﬁnal solution becomes
An = 1
2 n(n + 1) + 1,
n ∈N.
Example 5.30 We shall by a binary sequence of length n understand n binary numbers in a given
order, where the binary numbers are 0 and 1. Find the number An of all such sequences, which do
not contain two successive zeros.
Let Bn denote the number of sequences which satisﬁes the condition above and which also end by 1.
Similarly, let Cn denote the number of sequences satisfying the condition above and ending on 0.
1) Find A1, A2 and A3.
2) What is the connection between An+1 and Bn and Cn?
3) What is the connection between An−1 and Bn?
4) Find by means of (2) and (3) a diﬀerence equation for An, and ﬁnd An.
A. Setup of a diﬀerence equation. The situation is the same as in Example 5.31, although we her
have a more complicated equation. By a comparison between the results of the two examples we
see that we obtain the same solution.
D. Analyze the given situations.
I. 1) We get by counting all possible sequences that
a) If n = 1, we have the sequences 0, 1, which are both of the desired type, hence A1 = 2.
b) If n = 2, then we have four possibilities
00,
01,
10,
11,
hog which the latter three satisfy the claim, hence A2 = 3.
c) If r n = 3, then we have eight possibilities,
000,
001,
010,
011,
100,
101,
110,
111,
of which the ﬁve underlined sequences fulﬁl the criterion, hence A3 = 5.
2) It follows immediately that
An+1 = 2Bn + Cn.
In fact, after a sequence from Bn can we choose both 0 and 1 (two possibilities), while we after
a sequence from Cn are forced to choose 1, so we have only one possibility.
3) Clearly,
An−1 = Bn.
In fact, every sequence from An−1 can always be followed by 1 without destroying the condition.
The number must therefore be the same.

4) Before we can set up a diﬀerence equation for An, we have to eliminate Cn. Every sequence
from Cn has 0 as its last term, so the second last digit must necessarily be 1. This means that
Cn = Bn−1.
We have the three equations
An+1 = 2Bn + Cn,
An−1 = Bn,
Cn = Bn−1.
Hence,
An+1 = 2Bn + Cn = 2Bn + Bn−1 = 2An−1 + An−2,
thus by a shift of index and a rearrangement,
An −2An−2 −An−3 = 0,
n ≥3.
This is a linear homogeneous diﬀerence equation of third order. The characteristic polynomial
R3 −2R −1 has the root R = −1, so
R3 −2R −1 = (R + 1)(R2 −R −1).

Example 5.31 A coin is thrown n times. For each throw we notice whether we have got heads or
tails, and the total result can be described by a sequence like HHTH . . . TT. There are in total 2n
such sequences. The problem is to ﬁnd the probability of that one in such a sequence does not get two
tails successively.
Let An denote the number of sequences with the desired property, and let pn denote the unknown
probability.
1) Prove that An fulﬁls the diﬀerence equation
An+1 = An + An−1,
n ≥2.
2) Find pn and limn→+∞pn.
A. Diﬀerence equation. If we write 0 instead of T, and 1 instead of H, the situation is analogous
to the one in Example 5.30, and the solution An ought to be the same. Note that the diﬀerence
equation here is simpler than the one in Example 5.30.
D. Analyze how we get the diﬀerence equation. Then solve the equation and ﬁnd pn.
I. 1) Let us consider an element from An. Then we have two possibilities:
a) If the element terminates with a T, will the next element only be included, if the next throw
is an H. We denote the number of elements by An,K.
b) If the element terminates with an H (and the number is An,H), then we can allow both H
and T in the next throw, thus
An+1 = An,K + 2An,P = (An,K + An,P ) + An,P = An + An,P .
Then An,P must be equal to An−1, because one after each element, which contributes to
An−1, can allow H to be the next digit, when we have a contribution to An,P , and every
contribution to An,P is obtained in this way. Then
An+1 = An + An−1,
n ≥2.
2) Then we get by a rearrangement that
An −An−1 −An−2 = 0,
n ≥3.
This is a linear, homogeneous diﬀerence equation of second order. The characteristic polynomial
R2 −R −1 has the two simple roots
R = 1 ±

b) If n = 2, then we have the four possibilities
