Contact: Barbara P. Holum, Designated Fed.Off.
History: Committee was established in March 1998. It is a
public advisory committee of the Commodity Futures Trad-
ing Commission. The globalization of futures markets has
been a principle development of the 1980s and 1990s. The
recent volatility that has shaken world equity and currency
markets has demonstrated more vividly than ever before
that the markets are inextricably linked through common
products and related market participants. Events that occur
in one market can and frequently do cause global regulatory
and business concerns. Increasingly sophisticated and low-
cost communication technology such as the Internet has
expanded access to markets and to market users. The CFT,
as well as other U.S. and foreign regulators, is considering
appropriate regulation of the use of such electronic cross-
border vehicles for trading. These issues could profoundly
affect the integrity and competitiveness of U.S. markets and
U.S. firms engaged in providing financial services globally.
Commission was established as a result to assist the CFT
concerning the its role in working with foreign regulators
to address global markets issues, including enhancing inter-
national supervisory cooperation and emergency procedures;
establishing concrete standards of best practices that set
international benchmarks for regulation of futures and deriv-
atives markets; encouraging improved transparency in those
markets; improving the quality and timeliness of interna-
tional information sharing; and encouraging jurisdictions
around the world to remove legal or practical obstacles to
achieving these goals. Memberships: Committee members
total thirty and include those U.S. markets, firms and market

users most directly involved in and affected by global opera-
tions. They represent U.S. exchanges, regulators and self-
regulators, financial intermediaries, end-users, traders, aca-
demics, the National Futures Association, the Futures Indus-
try Association and the Managed Funds Association. Barbara
P. Holum, Commissioner, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, serves as chair and designated federal official.
Meetings: Committee meets several times a year, or as
required by changing events.

Description: This seminar focuses on the key expectations
from any data warehouse, namely to provide clean, consist-

decision-making needs. This is not a database design issue.
Instead, this is a data analysis, data cleansing and data trans-
formation issue. This seminar teaches how to address these
three issues by using two logical data modeling techniques.
The technique of top-down data modeling teaches how to
create an integrated logical data model, which is fully nor-
malized and populated with key business attributes. The
technique of bottom-up data modeling teaches how to vali-
date and map source data into logical data model, as well
as how to find dirty data in the source file and transform it
using the formal Normalization rules.

Description: Field Service Management enables a company
to schedule and communicate with field service personnel.
It also allows the organization to monitor, report and measure
field service activities. Recently, the role of field service
management in an organization has changed focus from a
cost center to a strategic line of business. A key challenge
in today’s business economy is the administration and coor-
dination of field service management. The provision of full
service to customers, adding value to both product sales and
support, is an opportunity not be missed in today’s tougher
economy, thus becoming more service focused, rather than
product centric.

Founded: 2002. Description: Today’s economy is putting
tremendous pressure on companies to better manage their
supply networks. In turn, companies are placing a heavier
burden on managers to help launch supply network initiatives
that focus on the global customer, take advantage of new
opportunities, bolster the bottom line, and improve cost effi-
ciencies in existing operations. These efforts require solid
strategies, clear prioritization, the understanding and buy-in

from internal business units as well as strategic partners,
and the right infrastructure and resources in place to support
it all. Executives in procurement, supply chain, manufactur-
ing, operations, and engineering management roles need
to create an environment and fashion the partnerships and
processes to make this happen. The Supply Network Confer-
ence is the premier conference addressing all of these issues.
Gain powerful insights from trusted people: peers at leading
companies in the electronics industry, financial and market
research community, and academia.

looking beyond traditional EAI and B2B solutions to Web
services to achieve profound, revenue-generating business
results. For IONA, Web services integration is driven by
two ideas. First, any application, whether firmly entrenched
or newly developed, should be able to interact with any
other relevant application, no matter where it resides or
how it was developed. Second, application development and
application integration should not be treated as separate
processes. In a fully connected world, they must be part of
the same process.
