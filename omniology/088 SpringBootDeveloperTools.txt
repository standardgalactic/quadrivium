Spring Boot Developer 
Tools

Developer Tools
• Added to Project via artifact ‘spring-boot-
devtools’ 
• Developer Tools are automatically disabled when 
running a packaged application (ie java -jar) 
• By default, not included in repackaged archives

Developer Tools Features
• Automatic Restart 
• Triggers a restart of the Spring Context when 
classes change 
• Uses two classloaders. One for your application, 
one for project jar dependencies 
• Restarts are very fast, since only your project 
classes are bring loaded

Developer Tools Features
• Eclipse:  
• Restart is triggered with save (which by default will 
compile the class, which triggers the restart) 
• IntelliJ: 
• By default you need to select ‘Build / Make Project’ 
• There is an advanced setting you can change to make 
this more seamless

Template Caching
• By default templates are cached for 
performance 
• But Caching will require a container restart to 
refresh the cache 
• Developer Tools will disable template caching so 
the restart is not required to see changes

LiveReload
• LiveReload is a technology to automatically 
trigger a browser refresh when resources are 
changed 
• Spring Boot Developer Tools includes a 
LiveReload server 
• Browser plugins are available for a free 
download at livereload.com
